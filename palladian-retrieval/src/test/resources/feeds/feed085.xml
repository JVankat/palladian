Once we saw the listing, my wife, our son and I decided that we had to jump on the opportunity to purchase our home. We were so excited, but I couldn't leave my "special assignment" mid year.&amp;nbsp; I had too much invested in the children and the program.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, my wife, Joi, left on January 30th to return to our home. Our 22-year-old daughter, who&amp;nbsp;was still living in Sunrise, moved back into&amp;nbsp;our house with Joi. &amp;nbsp;Josh and I stayed in California to finish the school year.&amp;nbsp; So, today is a day of celebration that we made it through a very long period of our family being divided between coasts.&amp;nbsp; Joi and I knew that it was the best decision for me to stay and finish out the school year.&amp;nbsp; She really gets the balance of optimal closeness and optimal distance involved in the connections I develop in any given school year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents have a life-long invested relationship advocating for their child.&amp;nbsp; This is especially true when parenting a child with special needs.&amp;nbsp; Parents develop a level of optimal closeness with their child, and they&amp;nbsp;are the experts on their child.&amp;nbsp; This is why parents play such an important role on the IEP team.&amp;nbsp; Developing&amp;nbsp; a trusting relationship&amp;nbsp;with open lines of communication is one of the key steps in serving as a child's teacher.&amp;nbsp; As a teacher, I am invested in each student 100%.&amp;nbsp; As a child's teacher, I think of that child as "my kid" just as a parent does. My energy is focused on getting to know how the child learns, what makes they happy, and what calms them when they are upset.&amp;nbsp; For children on the spectrum, this can be quite an investigation.&amp;nbsp; Parents provide great insight.&amp;nbsp; However, the trusting relationship of optimal closeness as&amp;nbsp; teacher is a bond that develops between the teacher and the child, and a bond that develops between the parent and the teacher.&amp;nbsp; As the school year comes to a close, students transition on to the next level of schooling, this relationship becomes one of optimal distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When working with preschoolers, one of my favorite age-groups, one thing that often makes me sad is thinking that the children are at an age where they won't remember me as they continue on their journey in life.&amp;nbsp; However, optimal distance&amp;nbsp;develops from&amp;nbsp;the investment I've made as that child's teacher. Each child&amp;nbsp;I teach leaves an&amp;nbsp;imprint&amp;nbsp;my heart that will last forever.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy keeping in touch and hearing updates of how "my children" are progressing year after year.&amp;nbsp; Having this blog will provide an avenue for staying in touch and staying connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, I have also worked with a tremendous staff.&amp;nbsp; However, we have navigated a sea of changes which has been a challenge.&amp;nbsp; Another reason why leaving mid-year was not an option.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As a new&amp;nbsp;team of TOSA's and a new program coordinator for Autism services, we faced a huge learning curve as we started the year.&amp;nbsp; Through the year, I have found that our common denominator is wanting the best for children.&amp;nbsp; The process of defining "the best" and implementing "the best" has been the heart of the challenge, and will continue to evolve.&amp;nbsp; I look forward to hearing from the team as the evolution of the program continues.&amp;nbsp; The last day of school brings the emotion of fulfillment as I feel that I've done my part to contribute.&amp;nbsp; However, also feeling that I'm leaving in the midst of a work in progress.&amp;nbsp; Autism services will continue to grow and provide children with the best foundation for learning, and the level of support needed as the children transition&amp;nbsp; into, and through, elementary school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with my mixed bag of emotions, I head off now to enjoy, celebrate and say "so long" to an incredible group of professionals, parents and students.&amp;nbsp; Happy last day of school, and have a great summer vacation!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4328627078580163775-8316764727787624616?l=theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com/feeds/8316764727787624616/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com/2010/06/last-day-of-school.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4328627078580163775/posts/default/8316764727787624616'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4328627078580163775/posts/default/8316764727787624616'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com/2010/06/last-day-of-school.html' title='The Last Day of School'/><author><name>Dr.Niles</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14787050690765983078</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='00563115929342543179'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4328627078580163775.post-1536873965989953596</id><published>2010-06-06T23:45:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-07T23:59:40.406-04:00</updated><title type='text'>My journey to becoming The Autism Spectrum Teacher</title><content type='html'>My first teaching job was as an assistant professor teaching neurology in chiropractic colleges.&amp;nbsp; For ten years, I taught neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and neurology.&amp;nbsp; I was fascinated with learning how the human nervous system forms and develops, and how the brain works.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, my passion for education grew.&amp;nbsp; During&amp;nbsp;my "decade of neurology" my other passion was being the mother of three young&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my youngest son entered kindergarten, it became apparent that he was having difficulty&amp;nbsp; speaking and learning.&amp;nbsp; The process of getting him evaluated and eligible for special education services was a new learning curve.&amp;nbsp; One which shifted my career in education in a way that merged my interest in neurology with my passion for learning and young children.&amp;nbsp; With a Masters degree in Education, and a Doctor of Chiropractic Degree, I said "good-bye" to my neurology teaching career in order&amp;nbsp;to embrace my new career as a special education teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the 2005-2006 school year, I was hired as&amp;nbsp;the first&amp;nbsp;special education teacher for the&amp;nbsp;inagural year of&amp;nbsp;Easter Seals Charter School in Daytona Beach, FL, teaching in a full inclusion preschool program.&amp;nbsp;The class consisted of 50% of students with special needs, and&amp;nbsp;50% typical developing 3 to 5 year-old preschoolers.&amp;nbsp; The majority of students with special needs were students on the autism spectrum. I earned a temporary teaching credential by taking&amp;nbsp;the Flordia teacher credenitaling exams.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, through networking with other preschool special education teachers from Volusia County School District, I was accepted into a grant-funded 18 credit graduate&amp;nbsp;program through the University of Central Flordia for an endorsement program for PreKindergarten disabilities, an endorsement for the&amp;nbsp;FL Exceptional Student Education &amp;nbsp;(ESE) teacher certification.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, as I took courses in early childhood education at Daytona Beach College, the director of the&amp;nbsp; program learned of my Masters in Education and my job teaching at Easter Seals, and&amp;nbsp;offered me an adjunct position teaching in the Early Childhood Education program.&amp;nbsp; Among the courses I taught during my year and a half tenure as an adjunct professor was "Teaching the Exceptional Learner".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 2006-07 school year, I was recruited to teach a preschool special education class within the school district of Volusia county.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;taught a varied exceptionalities class with preschool&amp;nbsp;students with mild to moderate disabilities, including students on the Autism Spectrum&amp;nbsp;at Indian River Elementary School in Edgewater, FL.&amp;nbsp; During this year, as&amp;nbsp;I was completing the prekindergarten disabilities endoresment, a second endorsement program for autism became available through Florida State University. I completed the autism endorsement program&amp;nbsp;during this year.&amp;nbsp; I also continued teaching in the evenings and summers for Daytona Beach&amp;nbsp;College. &amp;nbsp;My temporary teaching certificate was converted to a professionl educator certification after completing two years of teaching, and taking some additional coursework through the teacher induction program.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After teaching Extended School Year at Indian River Elementary, we relocated to south Florida.&amp;nbsp; At the teacher job faire for the School Board of Broward County, I was offered a teaching position at Sawgrass Elementary School for a self-contained class for students with autism in grades 3rd through 5th.&amp;nbsp; I was excited about the challenge of teaching older students, and learned so much about adapting and differentiating curriculum to meet a wide variety of indivdual needs.&amp;nbsp; However, I learned even more about autism this year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While visiting my family in California in August 2008, my family discussed&amp;nbsp;a possible&amp;nbsp;relocation to California to assist my aging mother and grandmother.&amp;nbsp; In preparation for a possible move the following summer, I submitted an application with San Lorenzo Unified School District a day before we were scheduled to return to Florida.&amp;nbsp; I was called for an interview immediately after dropping off my application.&amp;nbsp; The director of special education offered my a position teaching in a preschool autism class that the district was opening for the 2008-2009 school year.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accepted the position, and taught the preschool autism class for San Lorenzo Unified School District during the 2008-2009 school year.&amp;nbsp; Just after returning to California, and&amp;nbsp;right before school began,&amp;nbsp; I received a call from Capella University congratulating me on being the recepient of a $50,000 scholarship to pursue a Ph.D. in Special Education Leadership.&amp;nbsp; I opened my new classroom on August 20, 2008 and started classes as a full-time graduate student on October 5, 2008.&amp;nbsp; My Florida teaching certification was accepted through receprocity for a preliminary&amp;nbsp;Moderate to Severe Special Education teaching credential and an Early Childhood Specialist teaching credential in California.&amp;nbsp; In order to clear my California teaching credential, I&amp;nbsp;was requrired&amp;nbsp;to earn the CLAD (English as a Second Language) credential before 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 2009-2010 school year, I was offered a position as a Teacher on Special Assignment (TOSA)&amp;nbsp;for autism services for Mountain View Whisman School District.&amp;nbsp; During this year, I have also completed all courses for the PhD program, a 320 hour internship with the Director of Special Education, and my comprehensive examinations.&amp;nbsp; I am now looking forward to beginning my dissertation this summer. Another accomplishment completed this school year was earning my CLAD certification to clear my California teaching credential. I completed the CLAD&amp;nbsp;program online&amp;nbsp;through Stanford University.&amp;nbsp; In a future blog, I'll explain how the CLAD program and my dissertation are connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As fate would have it, my mother and grandmother are doing better.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, my family and I have decided to return to our home in Florida.&amp;nbsp; As the 2009-2010 school year comes to an end this week, I will be saying "good-bye" to teaching in Calfornia, and look forward to a new opportunity to serve student with Autism again in Broward County.&amp;nbsp; My noamdic journey over the past five years has been an excellent opportunity to learn and work with a vast number of professionals, families and students who are on the Autism Spectrum.&amp;nbsp; However, I am now ready to settle down in one location and teach in one place for awhile.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaching students with autism&amp;nbsp;is intuitive for me.&amp;nbsp;People often remark of the patience I must have to work with this population.&amp;nbsp; However, for me, it is a perfect fit.&amp;nbsp; I adore working with the students, because from them, I learn so much.&amp;nbsp; I am fascinated by each one, and motivated to find the best way to teach and connect with them.&amp;nbsp; I also enjoy working closely with each family, as I firmly believe that it takes a village to educate a student with autism.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to sharing more of my experiences as The Autism Spectrum Teacher through this blog.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4328627078580163775-1536873965989953596?l=theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com/feeds/1536873965989953596/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com/2010/06/my-journey-to-becoming-autism-spectrum.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4328627078580163775/posts/default/1536873965989953596'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4328627078580163775/posts/default/1536873965989953596'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theautismspectrumteacher.blogspot.com/2010/06/my-journey-to-becoming-autism-spectrum.html' title='My journey to becoming The Autism Spectrum Teacher'/><author><name>Dr.Niles</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14787050690765983078</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='00563115929342543179'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry></feed>
