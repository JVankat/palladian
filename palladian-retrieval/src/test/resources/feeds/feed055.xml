<title>Professor Khan Discusses Constitutional Enforcement in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt</title>
<description>&lt;img src="http://washburnlaw.edu/graphics/homepage/khan-ali.jpg" style="float:left; border:2px solid #fff2a5;" /&gt;Professor Ali Khan, in his January 29, 2011 foreign affairs commentary, &quot;Constitutional Enforcement in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt&quot; published in &lt;em&gt;Jurist&lt;/em&gt;, asserts that the people's revolutions of Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt are in response to sham democracies and their peoples' desire to enforce their rights and liberties. These three countries have established constitutions that promise a democratic form of government and espouse the principle of popular sovereignty. However, each country has been ruled by a single &quot;president&quot; for over twenty years. The people in these countries have elected to recall these irremovable Presidents by resorting to street power. The role of the United States in supporting these popular uprisings remains unclear.</description>

<title>Dean Romig Gives Keynote Address at Veteran's Day Celebration</title>
<description>&lt;img src="http://washburnlaw.edu/graphics/homepage/romig-thomas.jpg" style="float:left; border:2px solid #fff2a5;" /&gt;Dean Thomas Romig gave the keynote address during the Honors Ceremony held in conjunction with the Riley County Veterans Day Parade sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flinthillsveteransday.com/&quot;&gt;Flint Hills Veteran's Coalition&lt;/a&gt; on November 11, 2010 in Manhattan, Kansas. In his remarks, Dean Romig talked about the origins of Veterans Day and its purpose to recognize and celebrate the men and women who have willingly served in the defense of the United States. Veterans have served in many different ways but all have placed service to country before self. Dean Romig observed that the American military is &quot;one of the greatest forces in the world for good, for liberty, and for peace.&quot; He illustrated the postive impact the military can have with examples from Bastogne, Belgium and the Normandy coast of France during World War II and eastern Bosnia since the mid-1990s. Dean Romig told the audience that veterans should be proud of what they have done and continue to do and encouraged non-veterans to support those in the military and their families.

<title>Professor Rich Opinion About Free Speech and Picketing Funerals in New York Times</title>
<description>&lt;img src="http://washburnlaw.edu/graphics/homepage/rich-william.jpg" style="float:left; border:2px solid #fff2a5;" /&gt;Professor Bill Rich discusses &quot;Liability for Extreme Distress&quot; in an October 7, 2010 online &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Room for Debate column about free speech and picketing funerals. His opinion piece appears with those of four other law professors (Vikram Amar, University of California, Davis; Christina E. Wells, University of Missouri-Columbia; Alan Chen, University of Denver; and Joel M. Gora, Brooklyn Law School). Together they explore whether private individuals should be able to sue others for intentional infliction of emotional distress caused by offensive speech. Professor Rich provides several examples where tort liability for such action could be recognized. He concludes that &quot;that tort actions by their nature open the door to extensive potential liability, especially when the victim is sympathetic and the perpetrator engages in unpopular provocation. Exposure to unbounded tort liability would inevitably have a 'chilling effect' upon speech, and limits would therefore need to be carefully crafted.&quot; Professor Rich also commented about free speech issues associated with &lt;em&gt;Snyder v. Phelps&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ksnt.com/news/local/story/Rights/8NxMI8NHy0uJ45buVUYfnw.cspx&quot;&gt;KSNT News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/WBC_Engages_In_Free_Speech_Battle_At_Supreme_Court_104451139.html&quot;&gt;WIBW News&lt;/a&gt; on October 6, 2010.</description>

<title>Professor Jeffrey Jackson Cited in 9th Circuit Judicial Selection Opinion</title>
<description>&lt;img src="http://washburnlaw.edu/graphics/homepage/jackson-jeffrey.jpg" style="float:left; border:2px solid #fff2a5;" /&gt;Professor Jeffrey Jackson's article, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://washburnlaw.edu/faculty/jackson-jeffrey-fulltext/2007-34fordhamurbanlr125.pdf&quot;&gt;Beyond Quality&lt;/a&gt;: First Principles in Judicial Selection and their Application to a Commission-Based Selection System&quot;, 34 Fordham Urban Law Journal 125 (2007) was cited by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, &lt;em&gt;Kirk v. Chief Justice Walter Carpeneli&lt;/em&gt;. Since 1959, Alaska has selected its state judges through a system known as &quot;merit selection&quot; via a commission. The plaintiffs in &lt;em&gt;Kirk&lt;/em&gt; challenged the merit selection system, seeking instead to establish the principle that all participants in the judicial selection process must either be popularly elected, or be appointed by a popularly elected official. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a challenge. An article in the October 3, 2010 &lt;a href=&quot;http://juneauempire.com/stories/100310/sta_715326378.shtml&quot;&gt;Juneau Empire&lt;/a&gt; provides further background. Professor Jackson's article is cited on page 16663 of the opinion.</description>

<title>Professors Rich and Kaye Comment on Snyder v. Phelps and Freedom of Speech</title>
<description>&lt;img src="http://washburnlaw.edu/graphics/homepage/rich-william.jpg" style="float:left; border:2px solid #fff2a5;" /&gt;Professors Michael Kaye and Bill Rich discussed the case of Snyder v. Phelps in an October 3, 2010 &lt;em&gt;Topeka Capital-Journal&lt;/em&gt; article. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case on October 6, 2010. Albert Snyder, the father of a Marine who died in the Iraq War, sued Westboro Baptist Church and three of its members after they picketed his son's funeral in 2006. A Maryland federal court jury found for the father, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the verdict. Both professors view this an important freedom of speech case. According to Professor Rich, the decision will fill a gap in First Amendment law dealing with whether traditional tort claims of civil wrong are limited by the First Amendment outside the area of defamation. Professor Kaye observes that free speech can be offensive but that allowing a private person to inhibit speech is inconsistent with out beliefs in the First Amendment and the Constitution. Professor Kaye believes the appeals court ruling will be upheld; Professor Rich does not know which of the parties will prevail.</description>

<title>Hoferer Presents 'Preparing for Business Practice'</title>
<description>&lt;img src="http://washburnlaw.edu/graphics/homepage/hoferer-paul.jpg" style="float:left; border:2px solid #fff2a5;" /&gt;On September 9, 2010, Paul R. Hoferer �75, gave a Lunch and Learn presentation on &quot;Preparing for Business Practice: Classes, Clients and Conflicts.&quot; Mr. Hoferer outlined three strategies that students preparing for business practice might want to keep in mind. First, he urged the students to know their clients. If there is an indemnity provision in a contract, he suggested, understand how that shifts liability and whether the client has any control of the premises in question. Knowing his or her client helps an attorney suggest alternatives (e.g. insurance) and provide better representation.</description>

<title>Professor Khan Provides Comments to NPR on Shariah law in the U.S.</title>
<description>&lt;img src="http://washburnlaw.edu/graphics/homepage/khan-ali.jpg" style="float:left; border:2px solid #fff2a5;" /&gt;Professor Ali Khan, commenting in the September 8, 2010 National Public Radio story, &quot;Religious Laws Long Recognized By U.S. Courts,&quot; noted that he sees a scenario where non-Muslims in the United States could be governed by Islamic law.  &quot;Right now Islam is expanding in the United States,&quot; he says. &quot;Now suppose that Muslims become a majority in a particular state; I think then the state laws would reflect Islamic law.&quot;  Khan cites the city of Dearborn, Michigan which has passed an ordinance that allows the call to prayer to be broadcast over loudspeakers.  He believes that the rapid growth of American Islam means that more towns will enact laws friendly to the religion.</description>
