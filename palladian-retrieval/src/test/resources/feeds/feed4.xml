			<itunes:summary>Chamein Canton knew at the startling age of 4 her life’s passion was planning weddings. With her fiery independence from her father and her sweet charm of a Southern Belle from her mother she was determined to have the career of her dreams. Life threw in a few extra curves for her: twin boys, divorce, uterine cancer and MS. But she persisted by becoming an author (7 books) and continuing to work to her dream of being a wedding consultant. As she puts it because of genetics she decided to focus on full figured brides and the treatment they receive when their day of days is about to happen. As a former plus size bride I knew what she meant. In 2002 she became MS Mother of the Year.

A perfect combination of talents to land her as a Creative director at an advertising agency, but in 2004 she left her ‘day job’ and those oh so chilly winters of Minneapolis to pursue her dreams. Karn then sashayed off to San Francisco in her favorite pair of strappy sandals where she now makes art, writes books, dodges crazy drivers on her scooter, hangs out in coffee shops studying people their shoes and hopes to share something joyful with the world. You may have seen her point of view art at Franklin Covey in a day timer or heard her wit talking about shoes on television. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see her in the future on comedy central. If you enjoy shoes and laughter this is a show for you!

Lynette Shirk is the author of six books and was the Pastry Chef at Williams-Sonoma’s corporate headquarters in San Francisco. Actually her start into culinary history was making pizza in the mid-west.   A graduate of Ohio State University, she moved to San Francisco to attend California Culinary Academy, where she cooked scallops with Julia Child.  Lynette’s books and 1300 recipes have been featured on QVC and in Family Circle magazine.  Making her presence known in the San Francisco Bay area she worked for restaurants from Bizou to the Hornblower Dining Yachts.  During that time she invented Java Lava and actually went to work for Spinelli Coffee Company to understand coffee better. Volcano Candy became a hit and she developed several flavors. Expect this to be a wild and calorie laden show.  Don’t Miss it!
