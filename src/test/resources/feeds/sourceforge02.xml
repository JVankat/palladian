Both projects seem to be large enough for GSoC. That's why they are
separate ideas on the ideas list.

Before reading your post about "as long as the browser window is open" I
had the same idea.

About selecting what values should be measured, I think that this
interface should at least propose a list of the most popular things to
measure, to guide the admin. I guess that admins will want to use this
to find problems on their servers.

 When you say you think it would be great are you thinking that just the
user preferences would be great and large enough for GSoC or my current
proposal?  Thanks for all your help!

The size of the RRD file does not increase over time.  THat is a
feature, not a bug :-) .  Merging of the older data (reducing the
granularity) is a side effect of this.  In my opinion, the way RRD
handles that is quite intelligent.  It would be hard to get that
functionality right using mysql and rollup tables.

Why do you say that RRDs are not portable?  I have seen them work on
bsd/linux (and on 32/64 bit).

Alright, that live monitoring could be awesome, too. The user could
select what values should be measured, they would be constantly
updated via ajax and it would be graphed with processing.js.
The data could be stored as long as the browser window is open, so it
could still be displayed on a time axis. At its best, one could just
leave pma running in his browser while testing different
configurations.

With the html5 client storage, even saving snapshots persistently and
comparing them could be done.

How does this sound?

As discussed on the list, asking users to setup cron is out of
phpMyAdmin's scope. Live monitoring tool is interesting.

Hi Marc,
i thought the process could be triggered by a cron, but if that is not
an option, historic data can not be collected, i guess. How about a
live monitoring tool? I could create a visualisation of the ratios of
the different query types. Constantly updating that with ajax would be
nice, and maybe even collecting the data in the browser and plotting
graphes.

Hi Philip,
so you plan that an external process will collect data? Please have a
look on this list archives, this was discussed a few days ago.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello everyone,

I'm a student from Munich, Germany and stumbled across the GSoC Idea
of collecting the data that is shown on the server status page and
rendering them as graphs over time. I will apply in the next days,
here is what I thought of implementing when I'm accepted:

Data collection: In the past, I used rrdtool to collect stats on a
server. Its datastore has a limited size - over time old entries get
merged together and the data gets thinner, but is never completely
deleted. Unfortunately, it is not very portable. Therefor, I would
implement a similarily behaving datastore ontop of a mysql table. I
think of storing each set of measures as a row and limit the number of
total rows, making room for new entries by combining one pair of
neighbouring old entries together.

Plotting: On the ideas page GD is suggeted, but I would prefer to use
processing.js, which is a javascript library that draws on a canvas
element with a similar usage.
To connect to the datastore I would build a json interface for the
collected data.

Let me know, what you think of it!

Best regards,
Philip

We are planning per user settings storage in a database.

I think it would be great, we have already several proposals for UI
improvements but none for this.

We don't have problem finding code which references to mootools*js, but
rather code which uses some of mootools functions.

One way to find this would be to run the selenium test scripts and then
grep the apache logs for mootool*.js.  The referrer page in the access
log should give an idea of which all pages use mootools (or include it).

Yeah, I'll see about making myself more clear.
I was thinking about storing configuration values in a database or file like
the current config.inc.php.
Is the project to large?  I didn't think it would be that big, but you
probably would know better than me.  Should I narrow my focus?

Ah okay, in functions.js there are some blob streaming functions which
do also use mootools.

The only mootools user I found is mootools_common.js (it should be
rather named replication.js), but I checked only separate js files and
not inline code.

As the location updater requires it and it is used on each page, I
think it's safe to assume jQuery is always present.

And it was probably mine fault, because other users were added earlier
than the one in common and I should have removed it.

Ah, I was not aware that common.inc.php now loads it. Well, this brings
another question: how will we document which code depends on jQuery? or
do we need to document it?

Short feedback (generally applicable to any proposal):

1. Fill in complete template.
2. Try to describe what you want to do ("Less ominous warning and more
   helpful help icons" does not tell me much)

Directly to your proposal:

You write about configuration page, where you want to store
configuration values? I think this itself is separate project which
will consume quite a lot of time (well we were thinking that user
preferences would be separate project for GSoC).

yes you are right,that there is no need to explicitly ask the user to
"select relation arrows",
but  i want to provide users with an option to select the Join
type(inner,outer,left,right).

i have not mentioned any details for writing Nested Sub queries.till now i
don't have a good design to implement them......and am still working on it.

Thanks

You need to submit some patch to be accepted, but you have time to

Clearly a bug (which reappeared in new upstream of php-gettext). I will
fix that.

Hi,
I'l submit my proposal formally on march 29.

Regarding Exporting it to XML format what i intended to say was i want to
exporting whole database into XML format with one click.

I've an idea on how to do it. MySQL supports converting sql query result
into XML and Mysql also displays complete list of tables using "show
tables;" We have to merge both the features. I Dont know if its extensively
useful but as an admin UI i want to provide all the features.

Thanks & Regards

Hi,
these are interesting points that you can put in your formal proposal,
when Google's interface accepts proposals on March 29.

In phpMyAdmin 3.3.1, in table Export you can export in XML. Did you try it?

Hi Ankit,

I had a look at your image. I'm not sure what you mean by "select the
relations arrows which we need for the query". I think that in a query
builder, the user should be able to specify what he needs just in terms
of tables and columns, and the product should build the correct joins.

Yes, see my post "problem with _pgettext() in English (US)".

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,

I pulled latest changes and on Status page I have a link:
[ $strShowStatusResetReset ]

This variable corresponds to the following line in messages.inc.php:
$strShowStatusReset = _pgettext('$strShowStatusReset', 'Reset');

Is this still work in progress or a bug? If the latter, I found many
similar cases in messages.inc.php.

We'll probably need to build some filename convention for /js. For the 
moment, just try to be clear ...

Isaac Bennetch replied in a recent thread with relevant information 
about this, which I quote:
---------
A good place to start is http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/Devel:Junior for
small code contribution ideas and
http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/Devel:Main and
http://www.phpmyadmin.net/phpdoc/ for documentation
---------

to which I would add

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, that's right.

In my master course, I worked on software testing. So I have good knowledge
with unit test, integration test and automatic test generation. So,  I wanna
write a proposal to automatic test, if possible. Case not, I'm also
interesting in charts in serve status page project.

Now the question: I need to do some code before submit the proposal? I need
to share the doc in the list, or just submit?

Yes.  I'm extremely sorry for the typing mistake, and hence the
off-topic discussion on the mailing list.  Realised it just now.

Wikipedia says : "Pagination is the process of dividing web content
and displaying it on separate pages." [0].  For all the results
displayed from a table (either while browsing or as the results of an
SQL query), we have the navigation bar which navigates from the
current set of results to the next.  I've right now got that to work
through AJAX instead of re-loading the entire content frame. :)

in libraries/messages.inc.php we have

$strCreateTableShort = _pgettext('$strCreateTableShort', 'Create table');

This seems a better way.  I'll make the changes in the code in some
time and test it, my guess is that it'll work fine.  Should I include
this change in the patch that I'll put in?  Also, I plan to put the
jQuery code for the time being in a file js/paginte_table.js.  Is that
fine?  Any particular convention I should be following when doing it?

You did not explicitely mention HAVING clause...

I think the div can be already present in the document (extra div doe
not matter at all):

<div class="slider">...</div>

And there would be javascript to set initial state based on the
settings and add add the link:

jQuery(document).ready(function(){
  if (pma_settings['InitialSlidersState'] == 'closed') {
    jQuery('.slider').addClass('slider-hidden');
  }
  jQuery('<a href="#" class="sliderexpand">Details...</a>').insertBefore(jQuery('.slider'));
}

pma_settings would be exported by separate code which will create
javascript array with settings (or rather subset of it which is needed
in javascript)

The code is just typed in mail client so it will most likely not
work, but I hope it shows the idea :-).

Ninad,
to insert that div element, if I'm not mistaken you must tell jQuery to 
insert it before of after a certain element; which element would you 
choose?

Maybe you could pass to this PHP function the name of the element after 
which you want to insert this div?

Both accessing it from browser or using 'git clone
http://repo.or.cz/r/phpmyadmin.git/' works fine for me. Maybe your
proxy prevents access there?

Hm. Ok. I removed my application from the mentioned links. I will add my
application to gsoc site.

I mentioned in the "Student application : no rush please" thread that I am
going to attach my application links to this thread and I got no negative
response so I thought it was OK to do it. Sorry for the fuss. (:

Martynas,
You should not send your proposals to these places. The only proper 
place to send your proposal in on the official interface at 
http://socghop.appspot.com/

Please send it there and remove it from the other places.

I have written my proposal according to the discussion we had in this
thread. If you want to check it out, you can find it here:

http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AcmR3UsXFvy-ZHJ3aG1tc18zZzVodmtuZHM&hl=en

where you can comment any points worth doing that. If the editable version
gets corrupted very much you can always find PDF version here:

http://www.2m.lt/files/GSoC_2010_phpMyAdmin.pdf

I would greatly appreciate any comments. However I will be unable to respond
until the end of this week since I will be out for the Easter break.

Looks good!

Please do not use short open tags (<?) but full version instead (<?php).

As there is not that much of output, I'd integrate this into
server_status (some of the information is already available there).

I am working on getting engine stats and calculating tuneups based on
that.  Michal, let me know where do you think this can fit in and any
other thoughts anyone has about this.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,

I've narrowed down the javascript code that is conflicting with my
jQuery code for paginating a table's contents to one particular line
in PMA_generate_slider_effect() in libraries/common.lib.php.  The line
is:

document.write('<div id="<?php echo $id; ?>" <?php echo
$GLOBALS['cfg']['InitialSlidersState'] == 'closed' ? ' style="display:
none;"' : ''; ?>>');

If I'm not wrong, the div is being generated on the fly with
javascript, so that it can b backward compatible in browsers where
javascript is disabled.  In that case, we could use jQuery itself to
insert that element, instead of document.write().  I'll go ahead and
try that, but someone please confirm this.  Once this is fixed, I'll
be able to submit a patch to Sourceforge.

Marc, you might know about this better :).

Thanx for ^^ !  I had commented out the javascript code that appears
at the beginning before, and checked it out.  But, it did not help.
I'd missed this extra jQuery snippet, even though I remembered seeing
at it and realising that it is one of Marc's recent additions and that
it could be conflicting.  As of now, I've commented out that snippet
and got it partly working, just need to remove the right divs and
replace them with the content that the AJAX request returned.  Hope to
get a patch in soon. :)

Thats because a JavaScript function you called somewhere is going in an
infinite loop ( or may be object it is dealing with is not found, like a div
tag referenced by its id). I guess its the CDATA JavaScript being sent in
the response line no 3. You cannot execute the JavaScript returned in a
response without using the eval function. I would suggest you use JSON as
the response form for that purpose.

I think that as a courtesy to subscribers of this list, there should be
no attached files.

However you could use our feature requests tracker or patches tracker
and attach your files there.

I think it should rather depend on the translator if he wants to lock
in the translation from other contributors.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,

As of now, my progress in trying to paginate the contents of a table
is that I have successfully written a jQuery snippet which modifies
the behaviour of the '>' and '>>' buttons to make an AJAX request.  I
have suitably modified the output of sql.php to print only the html
content of the table ( i.e. only the content generated by
PMA_displayTable() ), the SQL query and the Profiling Result.

However, I am right now facing issues in appending the HTML returned
in the AJAX query.  The moment I append the output to the DOM, the
right frame (frame_content) goes completely blank, and Firefox gets
stuck in a 'Loading' state, while Firebug does not show any such
request being made.  Could someone please tell me where I am going
wrong?

For reference, I've pasted the output of sql.php here:

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi Marc,

i have already tried that command but it is also not working,i am getting
following error
fatal:unable to connect a socket (connection timed out).

I also want to discuss about the design for visual query designer,i have
thought of some points like
to add an  option button  with each  selected attribute of table where we
will have  a menu bar with following fields GROUP ,ORDER ,Rename and Where.
   As user selects option from this menu bar other  boxes/options  will
appear as the case is.

i am planing to implement select from clause,joins,group by order by and
various aggregate function in query builder.you can check further details in
my Gscoc Application .

 please suggest any other functionality which we can add or any additional
features in the design.

Thanks,
Ankit Gupta

My bad, I overlooked the Documentation.html file in the phpmyadmin
project. I was looking for a doc(umentation) folder, and only found
the documenation-gsoc folder, so I started looking elsewhere.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[To PMA Team,

I'm the guy who asked about how to send a zip with screen shots and an RTF file. My gratitude to Mr. Cihar for his answer, suggesting to use a 3rd party image sharing site.

My question: surely there must be a simpler way. I can track an Amazon package that is traveling halfway around the world, but I can't submit a few images for your review and comments? No attachments?

I apologize in advance if it reads like I'm being persistent, that is not my intention. However, there should be a simpler way for submitting visually-oriented proposals. The PMA team may actually like what I send. I'm just trying to see if I can contribute in a small way, but that would require a fluid exchange of ideas, an electronic conversation if you will. How do people submit screen-shots or themes or anything that is not ASCII text in an email? We have to have an efficient way, or establish one.

If this email aggravates the team, please don't answer it, and I won't pursue the matter.

Again, thank you for PMA, and thank you for all your hard work.

Best Regards,
Nissim

Not right now, I just wanted to know other opinions.

I personally don't see anything good on changing files on checkout just
add some sort of id into it (it's clear case of mixing metadata and
data).

We already have a feature request for including such thing into
server status :-).

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1450298&group_id=23067&atid=377411

So yes, we're definitely interested (please note that your class needs
to be licensed under GPLv2 compatible license so that it can be
included in phpMyAdmin).

The only question is whether to integrate it into some existing page
(what I would prefer) or to create new one.

      <description><![CDATA[[Phpmyadmin-devel] RFC: Integerating mysqltuner into phpmyadmin]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[MySQLTuner is a script written in Perl that will assist you with your
MySQL configuration and make recommendations for increased performance
and stability. Within seconds, it will display statistics about your
MySQL installation and the areas where it can be improved.  More info
at <http://blog.mysqltuner.com/faq/>


I am currently porting this script into a PHP class, that will have
these public functions -
- constructor
- analyze
- get_variable_tuneups
- get_general_tuneups
- get_engine_tuneups (not yet ready)

I wanted to see if there is some interest from the PMA developers in
integerating this into PMA.  Currently there are tabs to show the
variables and status counters (server_status.php and
server_variables.php).  I was thinking of a server_tuneups.php script
that would print out tuning recommendations.

This is not a GSoC project.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Raj Shekhar

In http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/Devel:Git there are two commands in 
the "obtaining the code" section, try the one which does not use "ssh".

Yes, please list it in open source contributions as specified in the
template. I've just updated the application template to provide
explicit question about contributions to phpMyAdmin.

I have provided couple patches to PMA. So maybe it would be better to
provide a link to my application draft in the mailing list where I discussed
ideas. I would provide all the links to my patches in my application. Is
that reasonable?

I don't have any experiences with this. Quick googling reveals some
links:

As long as you find something properly maintained and in good shape,
there is no problem in including external libraries.

I think it would be easier to first convert it. We don't want to
duplicate the code or have need to make the changes in two different
code bases.

Do you have any suggestion on creating a postscript file other than what i

If so can you direct me to those resources.

as announced earlier, phpMyAdmin now uses gettext for translations in
master branch. As this changed quite a lot how the translations are
being used, I've written down guides for it to our wiki.

If you want to translate, you can find the information here:

http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/Devel:Gettext_for_translators

And for the developers it is available here:

I think that makes sense. Would the pdf schema export eventually also be
converted to use this framework? (Or is it better left alone since it
already works?)
