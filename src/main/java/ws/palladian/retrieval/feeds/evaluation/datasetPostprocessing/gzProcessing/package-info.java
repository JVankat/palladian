/**
 * This package is TUDCS6 specific (http://areca.co/10/Feed-Item-Dataset-TUDCS6).
 * 
 * This package may be used to generate csv files with reconstructed feed item streams from persisted gz files. It is
 * presumed, that the gz files have been generated by {@link ws.palladian.preprocessing.nlp.ner.dataset.DatasetCreator}.
 * 
 * While creating the TUDCS6 dataset, there was problem in processing feeds with altering window sizes, e.g. between 50
 * and 0. Every time the feed's size was zero, the {@link ws.palladian.retrieval.feeds.Feed#itemCache} has been emptied.
 * At the next poll with a window size larger than zero, all items seemed to be new, so a MISS was written to the csv
 * file and the current poll data was persisted as *.gz file. In most cases, there was no MISS, as the following example
 * shows:
 * Poll 1 contains items A, B, C, D (window size 4), all items stored in itemCache and written to csv file.
 * Poll 2 contains no items, window size is zero, itemCache is emptied.
 * Poll 3 contains items B, C, D, E. Comparing those with the ones in the cache from the previous poll results in no
 * match, all are presumed to be new so all are stored in the cache, a MISS line is written to the csv file, followed by
 * the items B, C, D, E.
 * Obviously, this is wrong and has been fixed while creating the dataset, so the first week was affected by this
 * problem.
 * 
 * An additional bug was in processing sessionIDs in items' link and raw id attributes. Both bugs can be fixed with
 * running {@link ws.palladian.retrieval.feeds.evaluation.gzPorcessing.SessionIdFixer} on the persisted gz files.
