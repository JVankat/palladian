The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin. When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built in 1740 for another school, which never came to practical fruition. Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd [http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/node/2231] notes: “In 1899, Penn’s Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia."

The '''University of Pennsylvania''' (commonly referred to as '''Penn''' or '''UPenn''') is an American [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Doctoral university|research university]] located in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, United States.  It is one of the [[Colonial Colleges]]. Incorporated as ''The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania'', Penn is one of 14 founding members of the [[Association of American Universities]].

[[Benjamin Franklin]], Penn's [[Entrepreneur|founder]], advocated an educational program that focused as much on practical education for commerce and [[Public services|public service]] as on the classics and theology. Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow a [[multidisciplinary]] model pioneered by several European universities, concentrating multiple "faculties" (e.g., [[theology]], [[classics]], medicine) into one institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php|title=Penn: Penn's Heritage|publisher=Upenn.edu|year=2011|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> It was also home to many other educational [[innovations]]. The first school of medicine in North America ([[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|Perelman School of Medicine]], 1765), the first collegiate business school ([[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]], 1881) and the first [[student activity center|student union]] ([[Houston Hall (University of Pennsylvania)|Houston Hall]], 1896),<ref name="University Archives">{{cite web|last=Tannenbaum|first=Seth S.|title=Undergraduate Student Governance at Penn, 1895–2006|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/studtorg/stugovt/housclub.html|work=University Archives and Research Center|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> were all born at Penn.

Penn offers a broad range of academic departments, an extensive research enterprise and a number of [[community outreach]] and public service programs. It is particularly well known for its [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|medical school]], [[University of Pennsylvania School of Design|design school]], [[University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine|dental school]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|school of business]], [[University of Pennsylvania Law School|law school]], [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|communications school]], nursing school, veterinary school, its [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] programs, as well as its [[biomedical]] teaching and research capabilities. Its undergraduate programs are also among the most selective in the country (12.1% acceptance rate).<ref name="Daily Pennsylvanian Admission rate">{{cite news|last=Ma|first=Michelle|title=Penn admit rate drops to record-low 12.1 percent|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/03/51549ac80b536|accessdate=April 18, 2013|newspaper=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=March 28, 2013}}</ref> One of Penn's most well known academic qualities is its emphasis on interdisciplinary education, which it promotes through numerous [[joint degree]] programs, research centers and [[professorships]], a unified campus, and the ability for students to take classes from any of Penn's schools (the "One University Policy").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/uplan/paoneuniv1972.pdf|title=Pennsylvania: One University|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Archives|year=1973|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref>

All of Penn's schools, alone or jointly, exhibit very high research activity. Penn is consistently included among the top five research universities in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mup.asu.edu/research2010.pdf|title=The Top American Research Universities – 2010 Annual Report|author=Elizabeth D.

Among them are the first general purpose electronic computer ([[ENIAC]]), the [[Rubella]] and [[Hepatitis B]] vaccines, [[Retin-A]], [[cognitive therapy]], [[conjoint analysis]] and others.

Penn's academic and research programs are led by a large and highly productive faculty.<ref name="chronicle.com">{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/stats/productivity/page.php?year=2007&institution=3257&byinst=Go|title=The Chronicle of Higher Education Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index}}</ref> In the last ten years alone 9 Penn faculty members or graduates have won a [[Nobel Prize]]. Over its long history the university has also produced many distinguished alumni. These include 12 heads of state (including one U.S. President), 3 [[United States Supreme Court]] justices, and supreme court justices of other states, founders of technology companies, international law firms, and global financial institutions, university presidents and 18 living billionaires.<ref name="Billionaire Universities">{{cite news|last=Sapra|first=Janhavi|title=Billionaire Universities|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/11/harvard-stanford-columbia-business-billionaires-universities.html?boxes=HomepageSpecialStorySection|work=Forbes|accessdate=November 10, 2011|date=August 11, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
{{POV|date=June 2013}}
The school considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of [[higher education]] in the United States,<ref group=note>Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. Penn, [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Columbia University|Columbia]] originated within a few years of each other. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century, including at the centennial celebration in 1849.  In 1895, elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the "Intercollegiate Commission" at the invitation of [[John James McCook (lawyer)|John J. McCook]], a [[Union Army]] officer during the [[American Civil War]] and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress.  The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the [[Academic regalia in the United States|Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume]].  This formalized protocol included a provision that henceforth [[academic procession]]s would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's "The Alumni Register" magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, in order to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, Penn's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank in academic processions as well as the informal bragging rights that come with the age-based hierarchy in academia generally. See [http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0902/thomas.html Building Penn's Brand] for more details on why Penn did this. [[Princeton University]] implicitly challenges this rationale, [http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/] also considering itself to be the nation's fourth oldest institution of higher learning. [http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/american-revolution/] To further complicate the comparison, a University of Edinburgh-educated Presbyterian minister named [[William Tennent]] and his son [[Gilbert Tennent]] operated a "[[Log College]]" in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with the Log College, including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became President of Princeton. (All twelve members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the "[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Side]]" or "[[Old and New Light|New Light]]" wing of the Presbyterian Church in the New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania area.[http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/founders.shtml]) This antecedent relationship, if considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify pushing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, earlier than Penn's 1740. However, Princeton has not done so, and a Princeton historian says that "the facts do not warrant" such an interpretation. [http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html] Columbia University also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1740 or 1749, as it claims to be the fifth oldest institution of higher learning in the United States (after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale and Princeton), based upon its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755. [http://www.columbia.edu/content/history.html] Academic histories of American higher education generally list Penn as fifth or sixth, after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia. [http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ConspectusH&CISOPTR=345&REC=1] [http://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/9120/article_RI234246.pdf?sequence=5] [http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/3878/gslisoccasionalpv00000i00140.pdf?sequence=1] Even Penn's own account of its early history agrees that the Academy of Philadelphia did not add an institution of higher learning until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities which began as colonial era secondary schools such as St. John's College in 1696 and the University of Delaware in 1743 choose to march based upon the date they became institutions of higher learning.  According to sometime Penn History Professor Edgar Potts Cheyney, the University did indeed consider its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the University issued by the U.S. Commissioner of Education. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the first educational trust that the University had taken upon itself. Cheyney states further that, "it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers." He also points out that Harvard's founding date is *also* the year in which the Massachusetts General Court resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a "School or College". As well, Princeton claims its founding date as 1746--the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original is extant. With the exception of Columbia University, the majority of the American Colonial Colleges do not have clear-cut dates of foundation. (Edgar Potts Cheyney, "History of the University of Pennsylvania: 1740-1940", Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1940: pp. 45-52.)</ref> as well as the [[first university in the United States]] with both undergraduate and graduate studies.

In 1740, a group of Philadelphians joined together to erect a great preaching hall for the traveling [[evangelism|evangelist]] [[George Whitefield]], who toured the American colonies delivering open air sermons. The building was designed and built by [[Edmund Woolley]] and was the largest building in the city at the time. It was initially planned to serve as a [[charity school]] as well; however, a lack of funds forced plans for the chapel and school to be suspended. In the fall of 1749, eager to create a school to educate future generations, [[Benjamin Franklin]] circulated a pamphlet titled "Proposals for the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania," his vision for what he called a "Public Academy of Philadelphia."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/brief.html|title=A Brief History of the University, University of Pennsylvania Archives|publisher=Archives.upenn.edu|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}</ref> However, according to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, "thinking the Rev. [[Richard Peters (cleric)|Richard Peters]] a fit person to superintend such an institution." Unlike the other [[Colonial colleges]] that existed in 1743—[[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[College of William and Mary|William and Mary]], and [[Yale]]—Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for the clergy. He advocated an innovative concept of higher education, one which would teach both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and doing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because provost [[William Smith (Anglican priest)|William Smith]] and other trustees preferred the traditional curriculum.<ref name="Penn's Heritage">{{cite web|title=Penn's Heritage|url=http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref>

Franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of Philadelphia, the first such non-sectarian board in America. At the first meeting of the 24 members of the Board of Trustees (November 13, 1749) the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] was offered without cost by [[James Logan (statesman)|James Logan]], its owner, the Trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site. The original sponsors of the dormant building still owed considerable construction debts and asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts.  On February 1, 1750 the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751 the Academy of Philadelphia, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first secondary students. A charity school also was opened in accordance with the intentions of the original "New Building" donors, although it lasted only a few years. In 1755, the [[College of Philadelphia]] was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction. All three schools shared the same Board of Trustees and were considered to be part of the same institution.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

[[Image:Penn campus 2.jpg|thumb|Quad in the Fall, facing Ware College House]]
The institution of higher learning was known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then-provost the [[William Smith (Anglican priest)|Rev. William Smith's]] [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a [[University of the State of Pennsylvania]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html|title=Penn in the 18th century, University of Pennsylvania Archives|publisher=Archives.upenn.edu|accessdate=December 9, 2010}}</ref> The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791 the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into the University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution on the new board of trustees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html|title=Penn in the 18th century|accessdate=April 29, 2006|publisher=University Archives and Records Center, University of Pennsylvania}}</ref>

Penn has three claims to being the [[first university in the United States]], according to university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9432|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> made Penn the first institution to offer both "undergraduate" and professional education; the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of "University"; and existing colleges were established as seminaries.<ref name="first university">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/genlhistory/firstuniv.html|title=The University of Pennsylvania: America's First University|publisher=University Archives and Records Center, University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=April 29, 2006}}</ref>

After being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the [[Schuylkill River]] to property purchased from the [[Blockley Almshouse]] in [[West Philadelphia]] in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]]. Although Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date; this is the year which appears on the first iteration of the university seal. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began to consider 1749 as its founding date; this year was referenced for over a century, including at the centennial celebration in 1849.<ref>http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/trustees.html</ref> In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of "the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself."<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the University of Pennsylvania 1740–1940|last=Cheyney|first=Edward Potts|authorlink=Edward Potts Cheyney|year=1940|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=|pages=46–48|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/penn_history/5/|accessdate=August 18, 2011. Cheyney was a Penn professor and alumnus from the class of 1883 who advocated the change in Penn's founding date in 1899 to appear older than both Princeton and Columbia.  The explanation, "It will have been noted that 1740 is the date of the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself," is Professor Cheyney's justification (pp. 47-48) for Penn retroactively changing its founding date, not language used by the Board of Trustees}}</ref> The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.

===Educational innovations===
[[Image:Universityofpennsylvaniacollegehall.jpeg|thumb|right|College Hall and Cohen Hall viewed from Woodland Ave., ca. 1892]]
Penn's educational innovations include: the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]], the world's first collegiate school of business, in 1881; the first American student union building, [[Houston Hall (University of Pennsylvania)|Houston Hall]], in 1896;<ref>{{cite book|title=Building America's First University: An Historical and Architectural Guide to the University of Pennsylvania|last1=Thomas|first1=George E.|last2=Brownlee|first2=David Bruce|year=2000|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=0-8122-3515-0|page=3|url= }}</ref> the country's second school of veterinary medicine; and the home of [[ENIAC]], the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946.

===Motto===
Penn's motto is based on a line from [[Horace]]’s III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), ''quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?'' ("of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?") From 1756 to 1898, the motto read ''Sine Moribus Vanae''. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as "Loose women without morals," the university quickly changed the motto to ''literae sine moribus vanae'' ("Letters without morals [are] useless"). In 1932, all elements of the seal were revised, and as part of the redesign it was decided that the new motto "mutilated" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, ''Leges Sine Moribus Vanae'' ("Laws without morals [are] useless").<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Samuel|year=2002|url=http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0102/0102finals.html|title=Whiskey, Loose Women, and Fig Leaves: The University's seal has a curious history|journal=Pennsylvania Gazette|volume=100|issue=3}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[Image:Foliage at Penn 2005 035.jpg|thumb|right|Overlooking Lower Quad from Upper Quad]]
Much of Penn's architecture was designed by the [[Cope & Stewardson]] firm, whose principal architects combined the [[Gothic architecture]] of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] style. The present core campus covers over {{convert|279|acre|km2}} in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City district; the older heart of the campus comprises the [[University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District]]. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants and pubs, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus.

The Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th & Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Pennsylvania Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage|url=http://www.blta.com/#/3/0/4/7/|publisher=BLT Architects|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, Penn acquired about {{convert|35|acre|m2}} between the campus and the [[Schuylkill River]] (the former site of the [[Philadelphia Civic Center]] and a nearby {{convert|24|acre|m2|sing=on}} site owned by the [[United States Postal Service]]). Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]]. Over the next decade, the site will become the home to educational, research, [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]], and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] facilities. The first phase, a comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011. Penn also plans new connections between the campus and the city, including a pedestrian bridge. In 2010 Penn, in its first significant expansion across the [[Schuylkill River]], purchased 23 acres at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue from [[DuPont]] for storage and office space.

In September 2011 Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million {{convert|24|acre|m2|sing=on}} Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets. The University also owns the {{convert|92|acre|m2|sing=on}} [[Morris Arboretum]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chestnut Hill]] in northwestern Philadelphia, the official arboretum of the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. Penn also owns the {{convert|687|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[New Bolton Center]], the research and large-animal health care center of its Veterinary School.

Penn borders [[Drexel University]] and is near the [[University of the Sciences in Philadelphia]]. The renowned cancer research center [[Wistar Institute]] is also located on campus. In 2014 a new 7-story glass and steel building will be completed next to the Institute's historic 117-year-old brick building further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clarke|first=Dominique|title=Wistar strategic plan includes new building and research|url=http://thedp.com/index.php/article/2011/09/wistar_strategic_plan_includes_new_building_and_research|accessdate=November 10, 2011|newspaper=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=September 26, 2011}}</ref>

===Libraries===<!-- This section is linked from [[NeXT]] -->
[[Image:FisherFineArtsLibrary.JPG|thumb|right|[[Fisher Fine Arts Library]], also referred to as the Furness Library or simply the Fine Arts Library]]
Penn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Lewis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost [[William Smith (Anglican priest)|William Smith]] sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. More than 250 years later, it has grown into a system of 15 libraries (13 are on the contiguous campus) with 400 [[full-time equivalent]] (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48&nbsp;million. The library system holds 6.01&nbsp;million book and serial volumes as well as 4.21&nbsp;million [[microform]] items.<ref name="Penn: Penn Facts" /> It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://datafarm.library.upenn.edu/|title=Penn Library Data Farm|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref>

Since the University museum was founded in 1887, it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide.<ref name="About UPM">{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.penn.museum/about-us.html|work=Penn Museum|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|accessdate=August 20, 2011}}</ref> The museum's first project was an excavation of [[Nippur]], a location in current day Iraq.<ref name="Penn museum research">{{cite web|title=Research at the Penn Museum|url=http://www.penn.museum/research.html|work=Penn Museum|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Antrhopology|accessdate=August 20, 2011}}</ref> The museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from [[Egypt]], the Middle East, [[Mesoamerica]], Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa, and indigenous artifacts of the Americas.<ref name="About UPM" /> Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the [[Ur III|royal tombs of Ur]].  The Museum's excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the [[Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World]]. Features of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building include a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] and gardens that include Egyptian [[papyrus]]. The [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Art]], which is based on Penn's campus, showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year.

===Residences===
{{Main|University of Pennsylvania College Houses}}
Every College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.<ref name="College House PDF">{{cite web|title=College Houses at Penn|url=http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/collegehouses_11-12.pdf|work=College Houses and Academic Services|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.

The College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill, Kings Court English, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware.<ref>http://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/brochure/index.asp</ref> Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware, and Riepe together make up one building called "The Quad."

==Academics==
{{Graduate schools of the University of Pennsylvania}}

[[Image:PENN 043.jpg|thumb|Lower Quad in winter, from Riepe College House]]
The [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences, which also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, Penn's division for non-traditional undergraduate and graduate students. [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other undergraduate schools include the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing|School of Nursing]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)]]

Penn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers joint-degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's "One University" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools, except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Haverford College|Haverford]], and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]], under a reciprocal agreement known as the [[Quaker Consortium]].

===Coordinated dual-degree and interdisciplinary programs===
Penn offers specialized [[double degree|coordinated dual-degree]] (CDD) programs, which award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the University upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools. Undergraduate programs include:
* [[The Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology]]
* [[The Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business]]
* Nursing and Health Care Management
* [[Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management|The Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management]]
* Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)
* Accelerated 7 year Bio-Dental Program

Dual-degree programs which lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, "dual degree" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as a Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. In addition, the [[Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences]] allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a B.A. and a M.S. in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) will be first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn’s School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.

For graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized joint-degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA, and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.

Penn's health-related programs—including the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine, and programs in bioengineering (School of Engineering) and health management (the Wharton School)—are among the university's strongest academic components. The combination of intellectual breadth, research funding (each of the health sciences schools ranks in the top 5 in annual NIH funding), clinical resources and overall scale ranks Penn with only a small handful of peer universities in the U.S.

The size of Penn's biomedical research organization, however, adds a very capital intensive component to the university's operations, and introduces revenue instability due to changing government regulations, reduced federal funding for research, and [[Medicaid]]/[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program changes. This is a primary reason highlighted in bond rating agencies' views on Penn's overall financial rating, which ranks one notch below its academic peers. Penn has worked to address these issues by pooling its schools (as well as several hospitals and clinical practices) into the [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]], thereby pooling resources for greater efficiencies and research impact.

===Admissions selectivity===
The ''[[Princeton Review]]'' ranks Penn as the 6th most selective school in the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.mycollegeplanning.com/images/pdfs/The%20Ten%20Toughest%20Schools%20to%20Get%20Into%5B1%5D.pdf|title=The Ten Toughest Schools to Get Into|publisher=My College Planning LLC|accessdate=July 31, 2011}}</ref> For the Class of 2015, entering in the fall of 2011, the University received a record of 31,659 applications and admitted 12.26 percent of the applicants (9.5% in the regular decision cycle), marking Penn's most selective admissions cycle in the history of the University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedp.com/article/admissions-rate-drops-123-percent|title=Admissions rate falls to 12.3 percent|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, Penn's admissions rates, like most universities', vary considerably based on school and program. Based on admission statistics from ''U.S. News and World Report'', Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, and veterinary), and its business school.

[[File:Eniac.jpg|left|thumb|[[ENIAC]], the first general-purpose electronic computer, was born at Penn in 1946]]
Penn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments. In 1852 Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called ''The American Law Register,'' now the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review|Penn Law Review]]'', one of the most cited law journals in the world).<ref>{{cite web|title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking|url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx|publisher=Washington and Lee University School of Law|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref> Under the deanship of [[William Draper Lewis]], the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.<ref>Owen Roberts, William Draper Lewis, 89 U.

Several major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best well known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer ([[ENIAC]]) was born in 1946 at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]].<ref name="Moore Engineering">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/computers/intro.html|title=Important Milestones and Fascinating Innovations During the Last Fifty Years of Computing Research at the University of Pennsylvania}}</ref> It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular [[COBOL]] programming language.<ref name="Moore Engineering"/> Penn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The [[dialysis]] machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med;<ref name="Medical Innovations">{{cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/research/visitors/highlights.shtml|title=Some Research Highlights at PENN Medicine}}</ref> the [[Rubella]] and [[Hepatitis B]] vaccines were developed at Penn;<ref name="Medical Innovations"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/390/000130997/|title=Baruch S.

The theory of [[BCS theory|superconductivity]] was also partly developed at Penn, by then faculty member [[John Robert Schrieffer]] (along with [[John Bardeen]] and [[Leon Cooper]]). The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are [[conjoint analysis]], widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, [[Simon Kuznets]]'s method of measuring [[Gross National Product]],<ref name="125 Influential People and Ideas">{{cite web|url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/infodocs/alum_mag/am07anniv.pdf|title=125 Influential People and Ideas}}</ref> the [[Penn effect]] (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones), and the "Wharton Model"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/727461/Wharton-Model|title=Wharton Model (economics) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref> developed by Nobel-laurete [[Lawrence Klein]] to measure and forecast economic activity.

[[File:Penn Park.jpg|thumb|The newly-built state of the art sports complex at the University of Pennsylvania.]]

The current club has its roots in the 1960s. The University of Pennsylvania rugby teams play in the [[Ivy Rugby Conference]], and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s.<ref>Rugby Mag, College 7s Looks to CRC, Dec. 12, 2012, http://www.rugbymag.com/tournaments-special/crc/6668-college-7s-looks-to-crc.html</ref> As of 2011, the club now utilize the state-of-the-art facilities at [[Penn Park]].

===Football===
[[Image:FranklinFieldPenn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franklin Field]]]]
Penn first fielded a [[American football|football]] team against [[Princeton University|Princeton]] at the [[Germantown Cricket Club]] in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.<ref name="Fight song">[[Rottenberg, Dan]] (1985) "Fight On, Pennsylvania" Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pg. 25, 28, 33, 34.</ref>

Penn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus [[George Washington Woodruff]] introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the [[forward pass]], as well as the [[Placekicker|place-kick]] from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897, and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.<ref name="Fight song" /> The achievements of two of Penn's outstanding players from that era—[[John Heisman]] and [[John Outland]]—are remembered each year with the presentation of the [[Heisman Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the [[Outland Trophy]] to the most outstanding college football [[Lineman (American football)|interior lineman]] of the year.

In addition, each year the [[Bednarik Award]] is given to college football's best defensive player. [[Chuck Bednarik]] (Class of 1949) was a three-time [[All-America]]n [[Center (American football)|center]]/[[linebacker]] who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the '47 squad boasted four-time All-American [[Offensive tackle|tackle]] [[George Savitsky]] and three-time All-American [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] [[Skip Minisi]]. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], as was their coach, [[George Munger (American football)|George Munger]] (a star running back at Penn in the early '30s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], becoming the [[National Football League|NFL's]] last 60-minute man. He was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1969. During his presidency of the institution from 1948 to 1953, [[Harold Stassen]] attempted to recultivate Penn's heyday of big-time [[college football]], but the effort lacked support and was short-lived.

[[ESPN]]'s ''[[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]'' traveled to Penn to highlight the [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the popular college football show had visited an Ivy League campus.

===Basketball===
{{Main|Penn Quakers men's basketball}}
Penn [[basketball]] is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) [[Final Four]] appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], along with [[La Salle University|La Salle]], [[Saint Joseph's University|Saint Joseph's]], [[Temple University|Temple]], and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] to [[Texas A&M Aggies|Texas A&M]].

===Facilities===
[[Franklin Field]] is where the Quakers play football, [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[sprint football]], and track and field (and formerly soccer). It is the oldest stadium still operating for football games and was the first stadium to sport two tiers. It hosted the first commercially televised football game, was once the home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, and was the site of early [[Army–Navy Game|Army – Navy]] games. Today it is also used by Penn students for recreation such as [[intramural sports|intramural]] and club sports, including [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] and cricket. Franklin Field hosts the annual collegiate track and field event "the [[Penn Relays]]."

Penn's home court, the [[Palestra]], is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, [[wrestling]] team, and [[Philadelphia Big 5|Philadelphia Big Five basketball]], as well as high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn baseball plays its home games at [[Meiklejohn Stadium]].

The [[Olympic Boycott Games]] of 1980 were held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] following the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet incursion in Afghanistan]]. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.
