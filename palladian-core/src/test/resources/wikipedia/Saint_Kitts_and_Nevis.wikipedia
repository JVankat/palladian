The '''Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Saint Kitts and Nevis.ogg|s|eɪ|n|t|_|ˌ|k|ɪ|t|s|_|æ|n|d|_|ˈ|n|iː|v|ɪ|s}}; also known as the '''Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis'''),<ref>Both the names Saint Christopher and Saint Kitts are given in the [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html Constitution of Saint Christopher and Nevis].</ref> located in the [[Leeward Islands]], is a federal two-island state in the [[West Indies]]. It is the smallest sovereign state in the Americas, in both [[List of countries by area|area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]].

The capital city and headquarters of government for the federated state is [[Basseterre]] on the larger island of [[Saint Christopher]]. The smaller island of [[Nevis]] lies about 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called "The Narrows".

Historically, the British dependency of [[Anguilla]] was also a part of this union, which was then known collectively as [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]]. Saint Kitts and Nevis are geographically part of the Leeward Islands. To the north-northwest lie the islands of [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Saba]] (the [[Netherlands]]), [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]] and Anguilla. To the east and northeast are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of [[Redonda]], and the island of [[Montserrat]], which currently has an active volcano (see [[Soufrière Hills]]).

Saint Kitts and Nevis were among the first islands in the Caribbean to be settled by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first English and French colonies in the [[Caribbean]], and thus has also been titled "The Mother Colony of the West Indies".

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Saint Kitts was named "[[Mount Liamuiga|Liamuiga]]" by the Kalinago Indians who inhabited the island. This name, roughly translated, in English means "fertile land," a testimony to the island's rich volcanic soil and high productivity.

Nevis's pre-Columbian name was "Oualie," which translates to "land of beautiful waters," presumably referring to the island's many freshwater springs and hot volcanic springs.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Christopher Columbus]], upon sighting what we now call Nevis in 1493, gave that island the name ''San Martin'' (Saint Martin). However, the confusion of numerous, poorly charted small islands in the Leeward Island chain, meant that the name ended up being accidentally transferred to another island, the one which we now know as the French/Dutch island [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]].

The current name "Nevis" is derived from a Spanish name ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'' (The original name was the archaic Spanish ''"Noestra Siñora delas Neves"''), by a process of abbreviation and [[anglicisation]]. This Spanish name means [[Our Lady of the Snows (liturgical feast)|Our Lady of the Snows]]. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a fourth-century Catholic miracle: a snowfall on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome. Presumably the white clouds which usually wreathe the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate. The island of Nevis, upon first British settlement, was referred to as "Dulcina," a name meaning "sweet one." Its original Spanish name, "Nuestra Señora de las Nieves," was eventually kept however, though it was soon shortened to "Nevis."

There is some disagreement over the name which Columbus gave to St. Kitts. For many years it was thought that he named the island ''San Cristobal'', after his patron saint [[Saint Christopher]], the saint of travelling. However, new studies suggest that Columbus named the island ''Sant Yago'' (Saint James). The name "San Cristobal" was apparently given by Columbus to the island now known as [[Saba]], 20 miles northwest. It seems that "San Cristobal" came to be applied to the island of St. Kitts only as the result of a mapping error.

No matter the origin of the name, the island was well documented as "San Cristobal" by the 17th century. The first English colonists kept the English translation of this name, and dubbed it "St. Christopher's Island." In the 17th century Kit, or Kitt, was a common nickname for the name Christopher, and so the island was often informally referred to as "Saint Kitt's island," which was further shortened to "Saint Kitts."

Today, the Constitution refers to the state as both "Saint Kitts and Nevis" and "Saint Christopher and Nevis," but the former is the one most commonly used.

==History==
{{Main|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

[[Image:StKitts Brimstomhill.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Battle of Saint Kitts]], 1782, as described by an observer in a French engraving titled "Attaque de Brimstomhill".]]
Five thousand years prior to European arrival, the island was settled by Native Americans. The last wave of Native American arrivals, the [[Kalinago]] people, arrived approximately three centuries before the Europeans. The islands were discovered by the Europeans through a Spanish expedition under Columbus in 1493. In 1538, French Huguenots established a settlement on St. Kitts but the settlement was destroyed by the Spanish soon afterwards and the survivors were deported. In 1623, an English settlement was established, which was soon followed by French settlements, the island being divided by agreement. Dissimilar to many other islands, the local Kalinago people on the island allowed Europeans to colonise Saint Kitts. In 1626, the Anglo-French settlers [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626|massacred]] the Kalinago.

A Spanish expedition, sent to enforce Spanish claims, [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|destroyed]] the English and French colonies and deported the settlers back to their respective countries in 1629. As part of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1625-1630)|the war]] settlement in 1630, the Spanish permitted the re-establishment of the English and French colonies.

As Spanish power went into decline, Saint Kitts became the premier base for English and French expansion into the Caribbean, as the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]] for the English, and [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[Saint Barthélemy|St. Barts]] for the French were colonised from it. During the late 17th century, France and England battled for control over St Kitts. It was ceded to Britain in 1713.

Although small in size, and separated by only {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} of water, the two islands were viewed and governed as different states until the late 19th century, when they were forcibly unified along with the island of Anguilla by the British. To this day relations are strained, with Nevis accusing Saint Kitts of neglecting its needs.

Saint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, became an [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967. Anguillians rebelled, and separated from the others in 1971. St. Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983. It is the newest sovereign state in the Americas. In August 1998, a vote in Nevis on a [[Nevis independence referendum, 1998|referendum to separate]] from St. Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed.<ref>{{cite news |title= Nevis islanders apparently vote not to break away |date= 11 August 1998 |agency= Associated Press |newspaper= Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D6gaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ey8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4918,21223&dq=saint+kitts+nevis+referendum+1998&hl=en }}</ref> In late September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $458,000,000 in damages and property and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond. Georges was the worst hurricane to hit the region in the century.

==Politics==
<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
{{Main|Politics of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
Saint Kitts and Nevis is a sovereign, democratic and federal state.<ref>[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/constitutions/kitts/kitts83.html Art. 1, Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis Constitutional Order of 1983]</ref> The [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen of Saint Christopher and Nevis]], [[Monarchy of St. Kitts and Nevis|Elizabeth II]] is its [[head of state]]. The Queen is represented in the country by a [[List of Governors-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]], who acts on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Prime Minister]] and the Cabinet. The Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party of the House, and the cabinet conducts affairs of state. The country may also be described by the unofficial term, "[[Commonwealth realm]]", because it is a constitutional monarchy which shares the same monarch as some other members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

St. Kitts and Nevis has a [[unicameral]] legislature, known as the [[National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis|National Assembly]]. It is composed of fourteen members: eleven elected Representatives (three from the island of [[Nevis]]) and three Senators who are appointed by the [[Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]]. Two of the senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, and one on the advice of the leader of the opposition. Unlike in other countries, senators do not constitute a separate [[Senate]] or [[upper house]] of parliament, but sit in the National Assembly, alongside representatives. All members serve five-year terms. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament.

Saint Kitts and Nevis is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Parishes of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
The federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is divided into fourteen parishes: nine divisions on Saint Kitts and five on Nevis.

{{Main|Geography of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
{{See also|List of cities in Saint Kitts and Nevis|List of volcanoes in Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
The country has two main islands, [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]]. The highest peak, at 1,156 metres, is [[Mount Liamuiga]].

The islands are of [[volcanic]] origin, with large central peaks covered in [[tropical rainforest]]; the steeper slopes leading to these peaks are mostly uninhabited. The majority of the population on both islands lives closer to the sea where the terrain flattens out. There are numerous rivers descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population. St. Kitts also has one small lake.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

Saint Kitts and Nevis is a twin-island federation whose economy is characterised by its dominant tourism, agriculture and light manufacturing industries. Sugar was the primary export from the 1640s on, but rising production costs, low world market prices, and the government's efforts to reduce dependence on it have led to a growing diversification of the agricultural sector. In 2005, the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company, which had experienced losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit.

Former sugar plantations still dominate the St. Kitts landscape, however many of the cane fields are being burned to make room for land development, especially on the northern side of the island, in the parishes of Saint John Capisterre and Christchurch. The agricultural, tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore-banking sectors are being developed and are now taking larger roles in the country's economy. The growth of the tourism sector has become the main foreign exchange earner for Saint Kitts and Nevis. The country has also developed a successful apparel assembly industry and one of the largest electronics assembly industries in the Caribbean.

St. Kitts is dependent on tourism to drive its economy. Tourism to the island has been expanding since 1978. In 2009 there were 587,479 arrivals to Saint Kitts compared to 379,473 in 2007. This growth represents an increase of just under 40% in a two-year period. As tourism grows the demand for vacation property increases in conjunction.

In hopes of expanding tourism, the country hosts its annual [[St. Kitts Music Festival]].

St Kitts & Nevis also acquires foreign direct investment from their ''citizenship by investment program'', outlined in their Citizenship Act of 1984. Interested parties can acquire citizenship if they pass the government's background checks and make an investment into an approved real estate development.

===Economic Citizenship by Investment===
St. Kitts allows [[Alien (law)|foreigner]]s to obtain the status of St. Kitts citizen by means of a government sponsored investment programme called Citizenship-by-Investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciu.gov.kn/ |title=Citizenship-by-Investment Introduction |date= |accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> Established in 1984, St. Kitts’ citizenship program is the oldest prevailing economic citizenship program of this kind in the world.
