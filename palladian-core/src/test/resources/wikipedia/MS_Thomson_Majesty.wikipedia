'''[[ship prefix|MS]] ''Thomson Majesty''''' (formerly '''MS ''Norwegian Majesty''''') is a [[cruise ship]] owned by [[Louis Cruises]] and is chartered/operated by [[Thomson Cruises]]. She was originally ordered by [[Birka Line]] as '''MS ''Birka Queen''''' from the [[Wärtsilä Marine]] [[Perno shipyard|Turku Shipyard]] in [[Finland]], but completed by [[Kvaerner]] [[Masa-Yards]] as '''MS ''Royal Majesty''''' for [[Majesty Cruise Line]]. In 1997 she was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line and lengthened by {{convert|33.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}} at the [[Lloyd Werft]] shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]].<ref name=FoF />

==Concept and construction==

''Birka Queen'' was ordered by [[Birka Line]] for short cruises out of [[Stockholm]] as a running mate to {{MS|Birka Princess}}. The ship was ordered from [[Wärtsilä Marine]],<ref name=FoF /> but the shipyard went bankrupt in 1989. Operations were soon reorganized under the name of [[Masa-Yards]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Siljan viisi vuosikymmentä |last=Malmberg |first=Thure |author2=Stampehl, Marko |year=2007 |publisher=Frenckellin Kirjapaino Oy |location=Espoo |isbn=978-951-98405-7-4 |language=Finnish/English |pages=153–154 }}</ref> but the price of the ship was increased in the process, and Birka therefore refused to take delivery. Instead, the build contact was sold to [[Majesty Cruise Line]], who took delivery of the ship on July 2, 1992, renaming her ''Royal Majesty''.<ref name=FoF /> Due to her past, the ship has some features uncommon for cruise ships, such as the highest [[Finnish-Swedish ice class]].<ref name="dnv"/>

==Service history==
Following delivery, ''Royal Majesty'' set on her maiden voyage, a [[transatlantic crossing]] from [[Southampton]] to [[New York City]], on July 7, 1992. She was officially christened in New York City on July 21, 1992.<ref name=FoF /> She was christened by Liza Minnelli. Following this, she was used on three- and four-night cruises out of [[Florida]]. In 1994 she initiated a new [[northern hemisphere]] summer season itinerary with cruises from [[Boston]] to [[St. George's, Bermuda]], returning to Florida for the winter season. In September 1995 she participated in an expedition to the sinking site of {{RMS|Titanic}}, spending five days at the site with many survivors from the famous ship on board, while parts of ''Titanic'' were being salvaged.<ref name=Boyle>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/RoyalMajesty.html |title=''Royal Majesty'' |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Simplon Postcards |language= }}</ref>

On June 10, 1995, ''Royal Majesty'' grounded on Rose and Crown Shoal about 10 miles east of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, and about 17 miles from where the watch officers thought the vessel was. The vessel, with 1,509 persons on board, was en route from St.George’s, Bermuda, to Boston, Massachusetts. There were no deaths or injuries as a result of this accident. Damage to the vessel and lost revenue, however, were estimated at about $7 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/Publictn/1997/MAR9701.pdf |title=NTSB Marine Accident Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/12/us/cruise-ship-carrying-1500-runs-aground.html |title=Cruise Ship Carrying 1,500 Runs Aground -NY Times | work=The New York Times | date=1995-06-12 | accessdate=2010-05-11}}</ref>

[[Majesty Cruise Line]] ceased operations at the end of the 1997 summer season, and ''Royal Majesty'' was sold to [[Norwegian Cruise Line]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/MajestyCruiseLine.html |title=Majesty Cruise Line |accessdate=2008-04-23 |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Simplon Postcards |language= }}</ref> She was renamed ''Norwegian Majesty'', and in 1999 she received a {{convert|33.76|m|ftin|abbr=on}} lengthening at the [[Lloyd Werft]] shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], [[Germany]].<ref name=FoF /> Similar lengthenings had been carried out on NCL's ''[[Dreamward]]'' and ''[[Windward]]'' the previous year.<ref name=Boyle /> The lengthening of the Norwegian Majesty however was more technically complicated than those of the other ships, as she had not been designed for such an operation.<ref name=Ward />

In 2004 the ownership of ''Norwegian Majesty'' was transferred to NCL's parent company [[Star Cruises]] in preparation for potential transfer to the Star Cruises fleet or sale at a later date. She remained in NCL service without other changes.<ref name=Newman /> On April 23, 2008 ''Norwegian Majesty'', was sold to the [[Cyprus]]-based [[Louis Cruise Lines]]. Louis Cruise Lines had reportedly outbid [[International Shipping Partners]] with their offer of [[USD|$]]162 million.<ref name=CBR /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dougnewmanatsea.com/2008/04/18/seatrade-pride-of-america-not-sold/ |title=Seatrade: Pride of America Not Sold |accessdate=2008-04-19 |date=2008-04-18 |last=Newman |first=Doug  |work=At Sea with Doug Newman |publisher= }}</ref> The deal was completed on July 29, 2008, but ''Norwegian Majesty'' will be chartered back to Norwegian Cruise Line until October 2009.<ref name=CBR /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/star-cruises-218m-norwegian-dream-sale-fails/20017575692.htm|title=Star Cruises $218m Norwegian Dream sale fails|last=Hand|first=Marcus|date=2008-09-30|publisher=''[[Lloyd's List]]''|accessdate=2008-09-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On June 24, 2009, Louis revealed that ''Norwegian Majesty'' would be renamed ''Louis Majesty''.<ref>http://cruiseind.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/louis-majesty/</ref>

On March 3, 2010, three [[rogue waves]] hit ''Louis Majesty'', killing two passengers, and injuring a number of others, while on a 12 day cruise around the Mediterranean. The waves, which were reportedly in excess of {{convert|26|ft|m|0}} high, collided with the side of the vessel, smashing several windows in the saloon area. Water was taken on in the saloon area, which then drained down the decks below. The ship returned to port at [[Barcelona]] to receive repairs.<ref name=BBC8458547>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8548547.stm |title=Two killed as giant waves hit Mediterranean cruise ship |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=4 March 2010 | date=2010-03-03}}</ref>

''Louis Majesty'' will be chartered to Thomson Cruises from May 2012 and be renamed ''Thomson Majesty''. It will be sailing from Corfu in the summer and the Canary Islands in the winter.<ref>http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2012/03/06/39792/majesty+to+replace+destiny+in+thomson+cruises+fleet.html#disqus_thread</ref>

On February 10, 2013, while the ship was docked in [[Santa Cruz de la Palma]] in the [[Canary Islands]], five crew members were killed and three others injured during a safety drill when the lifeboat they were in fell into the sea, trapping the occupants. Julian Bray, Marine Analyst in the UK,  writing in the Cduck media news blog, confirms that crew were taking part in a training exercise to load, launch, and recover lifeboats, complete a regular risk/ safety programme and to ensure crew members have had recent practical training. Malta’s Maritime Safety Investigation Unit subsequently issued a safety alert following the discovery of significant corrosion on the inner strands of the fall wire involved. The wire rope had parted approximately where it rested over the topmost sheave, when the davit was in its stowed position. The fore and aft davit’s fall wires had been replaced on 22 August 2010 and the next scheduled replacement was due in August 2014.   <ref>{{cite web|title=Five dead on Canary Islands cruise ship|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21403419|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>
