'''Spice Run Wilderness''' (SRW) is a [[U.S. Wilderness area]] within the [[Monongahela National Forest]] of [[West Virginia]], USA.  Fairly remote, it has no passenger car access whatever.

==Access==
Users of SRW must enter it via the [[Greenbrier River]] (easily fordable at low-normal flows upstream of Spice Run), or by hiking in from the adjacent [[Calvin Price State Forest]], or by driving a high-clearance vehicle to the southeastern corner of the Wilderness along Greenbrier County Route 16.<ref name="Steelhammer">{{cite news|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/200910310524|title=Spice Run Wilderness: Truly wild, wonderful West Virginia|last=Steelhammer|first=Rick|date=2009-10-31|publisher=[[Charleston Gazette]]|accessdate=2009-11-01|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kx7ZqvXD|archivedate=2009-11-01}}</ref>

== History ==
Spice Run was named after a native shrub, ''[[Lindera benzoin]]'' â€” known as "spicebush" or "spicewood". The [[Spice Run Lumber Company]] created a logging [[boomtown|boom town]] that harvested stands of timber to float down the [[Greenbrier River]] for the [[sawmill]]s.  So great were these log runs, that the waterways were choked.  The "Run" in Spice Run is from the definition of "Run" as a waterway:  ''"to flow, as a liquid; or, to flow along, esp. strongly, as a stream or the sea: The rapids ran over the rocks."''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/run]

In 2009, Spice Run was designated a [[U.S. Wilderness|Wilderness]] along with several other areas of [[Monongahela National Forest]].<ref name="OPLMA" />

== Ecology ==
Aside from Spice Run, the [[Davy Run]] and [[Kincaid Run]] watersheds are within the Spice Run Wilderness.  All three are native [[brook trout]] tributaries to the [[Greenbrier River]].  Besides [[fishing]], [[camping]], [[hiking]], [[botany]] and [[bird watching]] are popular activities.  There are at least 230 species of birds to watch, and 89 plant species.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  Nine animals are on the Federal list for [[endangered species]] or [[threatened species]] such as the [[northern flying squirrel]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Across the [[Greenbrier River]] rests the [[Greenbrier River Trail]], maintained by the [[West Virginia Division of Natural Resources]] along the former [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] [[Greenbrier Subdivision]].  This portion still shows traces of the old lumber-mill on the banks where the flow of logs was controlled.  Of the original community of Spice Run, only one house remains standing.
