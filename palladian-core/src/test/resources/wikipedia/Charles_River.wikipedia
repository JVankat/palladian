The '''Charles River''' is an {{convert|80|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long river that flows in an overall northeasterly direction in eastern [[Massachusetts]]. From its source in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]], the river travels through 23 cities and towns until reaching the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://crwa.org/watershed.html |title= Charles River Watershed |publisher= The Charles River Watershed Association |date= |accessdate= February 5, 2013}}</ref>  It is also sometimes called the '''River Charles''' or simply the '''Charles'''.

==Hydrography==
The Charles River is fed by about 80 [[stream]]s and several major [[aquifer]]s as it flows 80 miles (129&nbsp;km),<ref>http://architectureboston.com/2010/05/13/how-long-is-the-charles-river/{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>{{dead link|date=July 2013}} starting at Echo Lake ({{coord|42.193012|N|71.5119|W|display=inline}}) in Hopkinton, through 23 cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts before emptying into [[Boston Harbor]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Thirty-three lakes and ponds and 35 communities are entirely or partially part of the Charles River [[drainage basin]]. Despite the river's length and relatively large drainage area (308 square miles; 798&nbsp;kmÂ²), its source is only 26 miles (42&nbsp;km) from its mouth, and the river drops only 350 feet (107 m) from source to sea. The Charles River watershed contains over 8,000 acres of protected wetlands, referred to as Natural Valley Storage. These areas are important in preventing downstream flooding and providing natural habitats to native species.

[[Brandeis University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Boston University]], and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] are all located along the Charles River. Near its mouth, it forms the border between downtown Boston and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]]. The river opens into a broad basin and is lined by the parks of the [[Charles River Reservation]]. On the [[Charles River Esplanade]] stands the [[Hatch Shell]], where concerts are given in summer evenings. The basin is especially known for its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration.  The middle section of the river between the [[Watertown Dam]] and [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] is partially protected by the properties of the [[Upper Charles River Reservation]] and other state parks, including the [[Hemlock Gorge Reservation]], [[Cutler Park]], and the [[Elm Bank Reservation]].

==Recreation==
The river is well known for its [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[sculling]], [[dragonboating]], and [[sailing]], both recreational and competitive. The river may also be [[kayak]]ed; depending on the season, however, kayakers can only navigate the Charles by getting out and dragging their kayaks for significant stretches. The "Lower Basin" between the [[Longfellow Bridge|Longfellow]] and [[Harvard Bridge|Harvard]] bridges is home to [[Community Boating]], the Harvard University Sailing Center, and the MIT Sailing Pavilion. The [[Head of the Charles Regatta]] is held here every October.  In early June, the annual Hong Kong Boston Dragon boat Festival is held in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], near the [[John W. Weeks Bridge|Weeks Footbridge]].

The [[Charles River Bike Path]] runs {{convert|23|mi}} along the banks of the Charles, starting at the Museum of Science and passing the campuses of MIT, Harvard and Boston University. The path is popular with runners and bikers. Many runners gauge their distance and speed by keeping track of the mileage between the bridges along the route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/track/indoor/bridges.html |title=Charles River Mileage Map/Table |work=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>

For a number of years, the [[Charles River Speedway]] operated along part of the river.

On July 13, 2013, [[human swimming|swimming]] for the general public was permitted for the first time in more than 50 years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brody |first=Sharon |url=http://www.wbur.org/2013/07/13/public-swim-charles |title=Public Swim Follows 50 Years Of Dirty Water |publisher=WBUR |date=2013-07-13 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Charles River (Pear Biter).jpg|right|thumb|View of the Charles River and Boston at night]]
The river's name, preceding the English version, was once thought to be '''Quinobequin''' (meandering), though that attribution has been discredited by, among others, the Harvard University Librarian in 1850.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The river was used by Native Americans for local transportation and fishing and as part of the passage from southeastern Massachusetts to northern New England.

[[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] explored and mapped the coast of New England, naming many features, originally naming the Charles River the Massachusetts River, which was derived from the [[Massachusett people|tribe living in the region]]. When Smith presented his map to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] he suggested that the king should feel free to change any of the "barbarous names" for "English" ones. The king made many such changes, but only four survive today, one of which is the Charles River which Charles named for himself.<ref>{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R. Stewart |title= Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |origyear= 1945 |edition= Sentry edition (3rd) |year= 1967 |publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]] |page= 38}}</ref>

In portions of its length, the Charles drops slowly in elevation and has relatively little current. Despite this, early settlers in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], found a way to use the Charles to power mills. In 1639, the town dug a canal from the Charles to a nearby brook that drained to the [[Neponset River]]. By this action, a portion of the Charles's flow was diverted, providing enough current for several mills. The new canal and the brook together are now called [[Mother Brook]]. The canal is regarded as the first industrial canal in North America. Today it remains in use for [[flood control]].

[[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] was the site of the first fully integrated textile factory in America, built by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] in 1814,<ref name=FrancisCabotLowellPBS>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/lowell_hi.html|title=Who Made America? Pioneers: Francis Cabot Lowell|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> and by the 19th century the Charles River was one of the most industrialized areas in the United States. Its [[hydropower]] soon fueled many mills and factories. By the century's end, 20 dams had been built across the river, mostly to generate power for industry. An 1875 government report listed 43 mills along the 9.5-mile (15&nbsp;km) tidal estuary from [[Watertown Dam]] to Boston Harbor.

From 1816 to 1968, the U.S. Army operated a gun and ammunition storage and later production facility known as the [[Watertown Arsenal]].  While it was key to many of the nation's war efforts over its several decades in operation, not the least of which being the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War I]], its location in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] so near the Charles did great environmental harm.  The arsenal was declared a [[Super Fund]] site, and after its closure by the government it had to be cleaned at significant expense before it could be safely used again for other purposes.  Likewise, the many factories and mills along the banks of the Charles supported a buoyant economy in their time but left a legacy of massive pollution.

==Creation of modern Boston-Cambridge basin==
{{main|Charles River Reservation}}
[[File:Charles River Esplanade, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|A sunny day on the Charles River Esplanade]]
Today's Charles River basin between Boston and Cambridge is almost entirely a work of human design. [[Owen A. Galvin]] was appointed head of the Charles River Improvement Commission by Governor [[William Russell (governor)|William E. Russell]] in 1891. Their work led to the design initiatives of noted [[landscape architect]]s [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] and [[Arthur Shurcliff]], both of whom had apprenticed with [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Guy Lowell]]. This designed landscape includes over 20 parks and natural areas along 19 miles (31&nbsp;km) of shoreline, from the [[Charles River Reservation#Charles River Dam|New Dam]] at the Charlestown Bridge to the dam near Watertown Square.

Eliot first envisioned today's river design in the 1890s, an important model being the layout of the [[Alster]] basin in [[Hamburg]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Karl Haglund|title=Inventing the Charles River|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-262-08307-8}}</ref> but major construction began only after Eliot's death with the damming of the river's mouth at today's [[Boston Museum of Science]], an effort led by [[James Jackson Storrow]]. The new dam, completed in 1910, stabilized the water level from Boston to Watertown, eliminating the existing mud flats, and a narrow embankment was built between Leverett Circle and Charlesgate. After Storrow's death, his widow Mrs. James Jackson Storrow donated $1 million toward the creation of a more generously landscaped park along the Esplanade; it was dedicated in 1936 as the Storrow Memorial Embankment. This also enabled the construction of many public docks in the Charles River Basin. In the 1950s a highway ([[Storrow Drive]]) was built along the edge of the Esplanade to connect Charles Circle with Soldiers Field Road, and the Esplanade was enlarged on the water side of the new highway.

The [[Inner Belt]] highway was proposed to cross the Charles River at the [[Boston University Bridge]], but its construction was canceled in the 1970s.

==Pollution and remediation efforts==
As [[sewage]], [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] and [[urban runoff]] flowed freely into the river from the surrounding city, the Charles River became well known for its high level of [[water pollution|pollutants]], gaining such notoriety that by 1955, [[Bernard DeVoto]] wrote in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' that the Charles was "foul and noisome, polluted by offal and industrious wastes, scummy with oil, unlikely to be mistaken for water."
<ref name="CRC" /> It was not an uncommon sight to see [[toxicity|toxins]] coloring the river pink and orange in spots, fish kills and submerged cars.<ref name="BostonLawsuit">[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/04/24/group_eyes_lawsuit_over_charles_river_pollution/?page=2 Group Eyes Lawsuit Over Charles River Pollution]</ref>

Once popular with swimmers, awareness of the river's high pollution levels forced the state to shut down several popular swimming areas, including Cambridge's Magazine Beach and Gerry Landing public beaches. Until very recently, rowers and sailors who fell into the water were advised to go to the hospital for [[tetanus]] shots.<ref name="CRC">[http://www.charlesriverconservancy.org/projects/swimming/index.html Swimming in the Charles River]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>{{dead link|date=April 2013}}

Efforts to clean up the river and restore it to a state where swimming and fishing would be acceptable began as early as the 1960s, and the program to clean up the Charles for good took shape in 1965 with the creation of the Charles River Watershed Association.<ref name="CRWA">[http://www.crwa.org Charles River Watershed Association, includes swimmability maps]</ref> In 1995, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] declared a goal of making the river swimmable by 2005.<ref name="CRC" /> In 1996, Governor [[William Weld]] plunged, fully clothed, into the river to prove his commitment to cleaning up the river.<ref name="welddive">[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/september96/kerry_weld_9-19.html Online NewsHour: KERRY / WELD: DEAD HEAT]</ref> In July 2007, the river hosted the Charles River Masters Swim Race, the first sanctioned race in the Charles in over five decades.<ref>[[Malcom Glenn|Malcom A. Glenn]], [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=519359 Brown Charles Gets Green Light], Harvard Crimson, July 20, 2007</ref>

A combination of public and private initiatives helped dramatically lower levels of pollutants by focusing on eliminating [[combined sewer overflow]]s and storm water [[surface runoff|runoff]]. A new [[Charles River Dam]] was constructed downstream from the Science Museum site to keep [[seawater|salt water]] out of the basin. Since Weld's stunt, the river's condition has improved dramatically, although it was not deemed entirely swimmable by 2005. In 1995 the EPA rated the river's quality as a "D" compared to the most recent ranking of a "B", and most days of the year the river now meets swimming standards below the [[Harvard Bridge]].<ref name="CRC" /> With the improved [[water quality]], swimming and fishing are progressively re-emerging as about 90% of the length of the river is now considered safe for swimming.<ref name="CRWA"/>{{dead link|date=April 2013}}
[[File:Sunset Charles River Boston.jpg|thumb|Sunset at Charles River in December 2010]]

The [[Conservation Law Foundation]] opposes the permit given to [[Mirant]] for the Mirant Kendall Generating Station, an electricity plant near [[Kendall Square]], charging that the water it releases causes blooms of hazardous [[microorganism]]s because of its warm temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clf.org/newsroom/conservation-law-foundation-secures-groundbreaking-outcome-in-genon-kendall-plant-case/ |title=Conservation Law Foundation Secures Groundbreaking Outcome in GenOn Kendall Plant Case &#124; Conservation Law Foundation |work=Clf.org |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}</ref>

It is a common belief that the water quality of the Charles River is at its worst after a large rainfall because of pollutants carried by runoff. However, a study, published in the Journal of the American Water Resources Association (April 2008) completed by researchers at Northeastern University found high concentrations of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] [[bacteria]] in the Charles River after a long period of no rain. Using a [[mathematical model]], the researchers then determined that two major tributaries, the [[Stony Brook (Boston)|Stony Brook]] and [[Muddy River, Massachusetts|Muddy River]], are the predominant sources of E. coli in the lower Charles River.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/540300/ Researcher Develops Model to Track E. coli in Charles River] Newswise, Retrieved on August 6, 2008.</ref>

Oysters have been used to filter and clean Charles River water.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2008/10/oysters_help_clean_the_charles.html | work=The Boston Globe | title=Oysters help clean the Charles River | first=David | last=Beard | date=October 26, 2008}}</ref>
