'''Nebraska''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Nebraska.ogg|n|ə|ˈ|b|r|æ|s|k|ə}} is a [[U.S. state|state]] on the [[Great Plains]] of the [[Midwestern United States]]. Its state capital is [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]].  Its largest city is [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], which is on the [[Missouri River]].

The state is crossed by many historic trails, but it was the [[California Gold Rush]] that first brought large numbers of non-indigenous settlers to the area. Nebraska became a state in 1867.

There are wide variations between winter and summer temperatures, and violent thunderstorms and tornadoes are common. The state is characterized by treeless prairie, ideal for cattle-grazing, and it is a major producer of beef, as well as pork, [[maize|corn]], and soybeans. Nebraska is overwhelmingly rural, as the 9th least-densely populated state of the [[United States]].

Ethnically, the largest group of Nebraskans are [[German-American]].  The state also has the largest per capita population of [[Czech-American]]s among U.S. states.

==Etymology==
Nebraska gets its name from the archaic [[Chiwere language|Otoe]] words ''Ñí Brásge'', pronounced {{IPA-sio|ɲĩbɾasꜜkɛ|}} (contemporary Otoe ''Ñí Bráhge''), or the [[Omaha-Ponca language|Omaha]] ''Ní Btháska'', pronounced {{IPA-sio|nĩbɫᶞasꜜka|}}, meaning "flat water", after the [[Platte River]] that flows through the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~koontz/faq/etymology.htm |title=Etymology |accessdate=November 28, 2006 |author=Koontz, John |work=Siouan Languages}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Nebraska}}
[[File:Nebraska 1718.jpg|thumb|Nebraska in 1718, [[Guillaume de L'Isle]] map, with the approximate area of the future state highlighted]]

Varying cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] lived in the region along the rivers for thousands of years before European exploration.  Historical Native American tribes living in Nebraska have included the [[Omaha people|Omaha]], [[Missouria]], [[Ponca]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], and various branches of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] ([[Sioux]]).

Long before the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–1806, [[French-Canadian]] explorers (including the Mallet brothers in 1739) traversed the territory of Nebraska on their way to trade in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], then claimed by Spain.<ref>"Nebraska", ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1910</ref>

In 1819, the United States established [[Fort Atkinson (Nebraska)|Fort Atkinson]] as the first US Army post west of the Missouri River, just east of present-day [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]].  The army abandoned the fort in 1827 as migration moved further west.

European-American settlement did not begin in any numbers until after 1848 and the [[California Gold Rush]].  On May 30, 1854, the US Congress created the [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] and the [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] territories, divided by the [[40th parallel north|Parallel 40° North]], under the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]].<ref name="Establishment">{{cite web|author=Interactive Media Group – Nebraska Educational Telecommunications |url=http://nebraskastudies.unl.edu/0500/frameset_reset.html?http://nebraskastudies.unl.edu/0500/stories/0502_0100.html |title=1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act signed|publisher=Nebraskastudies.unl.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>  The Nebraska Territory included parts of the current states of Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana.<ref>''The Handybook for Genealogists: United States of America'', 10th ed.  (Draper Utah: Everton Publishers, 2002).</ref> The territorial capital of Nebraska was Omaha.

In the 1860s, after the US government forced many of the Native American tribes to cede their lands and settle on reservations, it opened large tracts of land to agricultural development by Europeans and Americans. Under the [[Homestead Act]], thousands of new settlers migrated into Nebraska to claim free land granted by the federal government. Because so few trees grew on the [[prairies]], many of the first farming settlers built their [[Sod house|homes of sod]], as had the Native Americans such as the Omaha. The first wave of settlement gave the territory a sufficient population to apply for statehood.<ref>Marsha Hoffman and Dwight A. Radford, "Nebraska," ''Redbook: American State, County, and Town Sources'', 3rd ed. (Provo: Ancestry, 2004), 408.</ref>
[[File:00DI0943 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|[[Homestead Acts|Homesteaders]] in central Nebraska in 1888]]
Nebraska became the 37th state on March 1, 1867, and the capital was moved from Omaha to the center at Lancaster, later renamed [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] after the recently assassinated President of the United States, [[Abraham Lincoln]]. The battle of [[Massacre Canyon]] on August 5, 1873, was the last major battle between the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and the [[Sioux]].<ref>The Nebraska Indian Wars reader, 1865-1877 By R. Eli Paul p.88 Publisher: University of Nebraska Press (April 1, 1998) Language: English ISBN 0-8032-8749-6</ref>

During the 1870s to the 1880s, Nebraska experienced a large growth in population.  Several factors contributed to attracting new residents. The first was that the vast prairie land was perfect for cattle grazing.  This helped settlers to learn the unfamiliar geography of the area.  The second factor was the invention of several farming technologies.  Agricultural inventions such as barbed wire, wind mills, and the steel plow, combined with good weather, enabled settlers to make use of Nebraska as prime farming land.  By the 1880s, Nebraska's population had soared to more than 450,000 people.<ref>''Redbook''</ref>

The [[Arbor Day]] holiday was founded in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]] by territorial governor [[J. Sterling Morton]].  The [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] is still headquartered in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]], with some offices in Lincoln.

In the late nineteenth century, many African Americans migrated from the South to Nebraska as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], primarily to Omaha which offered working class jobs in meatpacking, the railroads and other industries.  Omaha has a long history of [[Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska|civil rights]] activism. Blacks encountered discrimination from other Americans in Omaha and especially from recent European immigrants, ethnic whites who were competing for the same jobs. In 1912 African Americans founded the Omaha chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] to work for improved conditions in the city and state. Activism has continued.

Since the 1960s, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] activism in the state has increased, both through open protest, activities to build alliances with state and local governments, and in the slower, more extensive work of building tribal institutions and infrastructure. Native Americans in federally recognized tribes have pressed for self-determination, sovereignty and recognition.  They have created community schools to preserve their cultures, as well as [[tribal colleges and universities]]. Tribal politicians have also collaborated with state and county officials on regional issues.

==Geography==
{{Further|List of counties in Nebraska|List of Nebraska rivers|Geography of Omaha}}

The state is bordered by [[South Dakota]] to the north; [[Iowa]] to the east and [[Missouri]] to the southeast, across the [[Missouri River]]; [[Kansas]] to the south; [[Colorado]] to the southwest; and [[Wyoming]] to the west. The state has [[List of counties in Nebraska|93 counties]]; it occupies the central portion of the [[Frontier Strip]]. Nebraska is split into two time zones. The Central Time zone comprises the eastern half of the state, while the western half observes Mountain Time. Three rivers cross the state from west to east. The [[Platte River]], formed by the confluence of the North Platte and the South Platte, runs through the central portion of the state, the [[Niobrara River]] flows through the northern part, and the [[Republican River]] runs across the southern part.

[[File:Scotts bluff national monument.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scotts Bluff National Monument]]]]

Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the [[Dissected Till Plains]] and the [[Great Plains]]. The easternmost portion of the state was scoured by [[Ice Age]] [[glacier]]s; the Dissected Till Plains were left behind after the glaciers retreated. The Dissected Till Plains is a region of gently rolling hills; Omaha and Lincoln are in this region.

The Great Plains occupy the majority of western Nebraska. The Great Plains region consists of several smaller, diverse land regions, including the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sandhills]], the [[Pine Ridge (region)|Pine Ridge]], the [[Rainwater Basin]], the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and the [[Wildcat Hills]]. [[Panorama Point]], at 5,424 feet (1,653 m), is the highest point in Nebraska; despite its name and elevation, it is a relatively low rise near the Colorado and Wyoming borders.

[[File:Chadron State Park.jpg|thumb|Nebraska's oldest state park, [[Chadron State Park]]]]

A past Nebraska tourism slogan was "Where the West Begins"; locations given for the beginning of the "West" include the Missouri River, the intersection of 13th and O Streets in Lincoln (where it is marked by a red brick star), the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], and [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]]. Nebraska is a [[landlocked country|triply landlocked state]], as it does not border the ocean, nor do any of the states it borders, nor any that they border.<ref>Note that Nebraska's designation as a "triply landlocked" state does not consider the fact that Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois have ports on the shores of the [[Great Lakes]] that have access to the seas.</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Clouds Cass County Nebraska.jpg|thumb|right|Clouds over a country road in Cass County, Nebraska]]
Two major climatic zones are represented in Nebraska: the eastern half of the state has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), and the western half, a [[semi-arid climate]] (Koppen ''BSk''). The entire state experiences wide seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. Average temperatures are fairly uniform across Nebraska, with hot summers and generally cold winters, while average annual precipitation decreases east to west from about 31.5&nbsp;inches (800&nbsp;mm) in the southeast corner of the state to about 13.8&nbsp;inches (350&nbsp;mm) in the [[Nebraska Panhandle|Panhandle]]. Humidity also decreases significantly from east to west. Snowfall across the state is fairly even, with most of Nebraska receiving between 25 and 35&nbsp;inches (65 to 90&nbsp;cm) of snow annually.<ref>[http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/products/atlas.html]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Nebraska's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|118|F|C}} at [[Minden, Nebraska|Minden]] on July 24, 1936 and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-47|F|C}}  at [[Camp Clarke, Nebraska|Camp Clarke]] on February 12, 1899.

Nebraska is  in [[Tornado Alley]]; [[thunderstorm]]s are common in the spring and summer months, and [[severe thunderstorm|violent thunderstorm]]s and [[tornado]]es happen primarily during the spring and summer, though they can also occur in the autumn. The [[chinook wind]]s from the [[Rocky Mountains]] provide a temporary moderating effect on temperatures in western Nebraska during the winter months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskaclimateoffice.unl.edu/weather.summary.Dec99 |title=Nebraska Climate Office &#124; Applied Climate Science &#124; SNR &#124; UNL |publisher=Nebraskaclimateoffice.unl.edu |date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcdne.org/climate.htm |title=Climate – Twin Cities Development Association, Inc. – Nebraska: Scottsbluff, Gering, TerryTown, Mitchell, Bayard |publisher=Tcdne.org |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Nebraska was 1,855,525 on July 1, 2012, a 1.6% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=PopEstUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/totals/2012/index.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico:  April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]]|work=2012 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=December 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>  The [[center of population]] of Nebraska is in [[Polk County, Nebraska|Polk County]], in the city of [[Shelby, Nebraska|Shelby]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Population and Population Centers by State: 2000|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=December 5, 2008|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt}}</ref>

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], 86.1% of the population was White (82.1% [[non-Hispanic white]]), 4.5% was [[African American|Black]] or African American, 1.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.8% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 2.2% from two or more races. 9.2% of the total population was of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] or Latino origin (they may be of any race).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/31000.html |title=Nebraska QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref>

As of 2004, the population of Nebraska included about 84,000 foreign-born residents (4.8% of the population).
{{US Demographics}}
The five largest ancestry groups in Nebraska are [[Germans|German]] (38.6%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (12.4%), [[English American|English]] (9.6%), [[Mexican American|Mexican]] (8.7%), and [[Czech people|Czech]] (5.5%).

Nebraska has the largest [[Czech American]] and non-Mormon [[Danish American]] population (as a percentage of the total population) in the nation. [[German Americans]] are the largest ancestry group in most of the state, particularly in the eastern counties. [[Thurston County, Nebraska|Thurston County]] (made up entirely of the [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] and [[Winnebago (tribe)|Winnebago]] reservations) has an [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] majority, and [[Butler County, Nebraska|Butler County]] is one of only two counties in the nation with a Czech-American plurality.

===Rural flight===
[[File:Nebraska population map.png|thumb|400px|Population density of Nebraska]]
Eighty-nine percent of the cities in Nebraska have fewer than 3,000 people. Nebraska shares this characteristic with five other Midwestern states: [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], and [[Iowa]]. Hundreds of towns have a population of fewer than 1,000. Regional population declines have forced many rural schools to consolidate.

Fifty-three of Nebraska's 93 counties reported declining populations between 1990 and 2000, ranging from a 0.06% loss ([[Frontier County, Nebraska|Frontier County]]) to a 17.04% loss ([[Hitchcock County, Nebraska|Hitchcock County]]).

More urbanized areas of the state have experienced substantial growth. In 2000, the city of Omaha had a population of 390,007; in 2005, the city's estimated population was 414,521 (427,872 including the recently annexed city of [[Elkhorn, Nebraska|Elkhorn]]), a 6.3% increase over five years. The 2010 census showed that Omaha has a population of 408,958.  The city of Lincoln had a 2000 population of 225,581 and a 2010 population of 258,379, a 14.5% increase.

*Christian – 90%
** [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Catholic]] – 28%
** [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] – 16%
** [[Methodism|Methodist]] – 11%

==Law and government==
{{Wikisource|Nebraska Constitution}}
Nebraska's government operates under the framework of the Nebraska Constitution, adopted in 1875,<ref>[http://www.kancoll.org/books/andreas_ne/state/state-p6.html "Nebraska as a State".]  [http://www.kancoll.org/books/andreas_ne/hon_tabl.html ''Andreas's History of the State of Nebraska''.]. Retrieved February 18, 2010.</ref> and is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.

===Executive branch===
{{further2|[[Governor of Nebraska]]}}
The head of the executive branch is [[Governor of Nebraska|Governor]] [[Dave Heineman]]. Other elected officials in the executive branch are [[Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Lavon Heidemann]], [[Nebraska Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Jon Bruning]], [[Secretary of State of Nebraska|Secretary of State]] [[John A. Gale]], [[State Treasurer]] [[Don Stenberg]], and [[State Auditor]] [[Mike Foley (auditor)|Mike Foley]]. All elected officials in the executive branch serve four-year terms.

===Legislative branch===
{{further2|[[Nebraska Legislature]] and [[Nebraska State Capitol]]}}
Nebraska is the only state in the United States with a [[unicameral]] legislature. Although this house is officially known simply as the "[[Nebraska Legislature|Legislature]]", and more commonly called the "Unicameral", its members call themselves "senators". Nebraska's Legislature is also the only [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] in the United States that is [[nonpartisan system|nonpartisan]]. The senators are elected with no party affiliation next to their names on the ballot, and the speaker and committee chairs are chosen at large, so that members of any party can be chosen for these positions. The Nebraska Legislature can also override a governor's veto with a three-fifths majority, in contrast to the two-thirds majority required in some other states.

The [[Nebraska Legislature]] meets in the third [[Nebraska State Capitol]] building, built between 1922 and 1932. It was designed by Bertram G. Goodhue. Built from Indiana limestone, the Capitol's base is a cross within a square. A 400-foot domed tower rises from this base. The Sower, a 19-foot bronze statue representing agriculture, crowns the Capitol. The state Capitol is considered an architectural achievement and has been recognized by the American Institute of Architects.

When Nebraska became a state in 1867, its legislature consisted of two houses: a House of Representatives and a Senate. For years, prior to 1934, US Senator [[George Norris]] and other Nebraskans encouraged the idea of a unicameral legislature, and demanded the issue be decided in a [[referendum]]. Norris argued:
{{quote|The constitutions of our various states are built upon the idea that there is but one class. If this be true, there is no sense or reason in having the same thing done twice, especially if it is to be done by two bodies of men elected in the same way and having the same jurisdiction.}}

Unicameral supporters also argued that a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature had a significant undemocratic feature in the committees that reconciled House and Senate legislation. Votes in these committees were secretive, and would sometimes add provisions to bills that neither house had approved. Nebraska's unicameral legislature today has rules that bills can contain only one subject, and must be given at least five days of consideration.

In 1934, due in part to the budgetary pressure of the [[Great Depression]], Nebraska citizens ran a state initiative to vote on a constitutional amendment creating a unicameral legislature, which was approved. In effect, the House of Representatives (the lower house) was abolished; today's Nebraska state legislators are commonly referred to as "Senators".

===Judicial branch===
{{further2|[[Nebraska Supreme Court]]}}
The judicial system in Nebraska is unified, with the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] having administrative authority over all Nebraska courts. Nebraska uses the [[Missouri Plan]] for the selection of judges at all levels. The lowest courts in Nebraska are the county courts, above that are twelve district courts (containing one or more counties). The [[Nebraska State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] hears appeals from the district courts, juvenile courts, and workers' compensation courts. The Nebraska Supreme Court is the final court of appeal.

In 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that the state's only method of execution, electrocution, was in conflict with the state's constitution.  For the next year, Nebraska had no active death-penalty law. (Prior to that ruling, Nebraska was the only place in the world that used electrocution as the sole method of execution.) In May 2009, the legislature passed and the governor signed a bill that changed the method of execution in Nebraska to lethal injection, enabling capital punishment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kolnkgin.com/political/headlines/46424547.html|title=Nebraska Changes Execution Method to Lethal Injection|first=Jason|last=Volentine|date=May 28, 2009|accessdate=May 30, 2009|publisher=[[KOLN]]}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> Executions in Nebraska have been infrequent; none have been carried out in the 21st century.  During the last few decades, residents have considered a moratorium on, or complete abolition of, [[death penalty|capital punishment]].

===Federal government representation===
[[File:Nebraska State Capitol at night.jpg|upright|thumb|The [[Nebraska State Capitol]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]]]
{{further2|[[United States congressional delegations from Nebraska]]}}
Nebraska's [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Mike Johanns]] (R), the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|Senior senator]], and [[Deb Fischer]] (R), the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|Junior senator]].

Nebraska has three representatives in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]: [[Jeff Fortenberry]] (R) of the [[Nebraska's 1st congressional district|1st district]]; [[Lee Terry]] (R) of the [[Nebraska's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]]; and [[Adrian Smith (politician)|Adrian Smith]] (R) of the [[Nebraska's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]].

Nebraska is one of two states (with [[Maine]]) that allow for a split in the state's allocation of [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]]. Under a 1991 law, two of Nebraska's five votes are awarded to the winner of the statewide popular vote, while the other three go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's three [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]].

===Politics===
{{further2|[[United States presidential election in Nebraska, 2008]], [[Nebraska gubernatorial election, 2010]], [[United States Senate election in Nebraska, 2008]] and [[Political party strength in Nebraska]]}}
For most of its history, Nebraska has been a solidly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state. Republicans have carried the state in all but one presidential election since [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]]: the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 landslide election]] of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], [[George W. Bush]] won the state's five electoral votes by a margin of 33 percentage points (making Nebraska's the fourth-strongest Republican vote among states) with 65.9% of the overall vote; only [[Thurston County, Nebraska|Thurston County]], which is majority-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], voted for his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger [[John Kerry]]. In [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], the state split its electoral votes for the first time: Republican [[John McCain]] won the popular vote in Nebraska as a whole and two of its three congressional districts; the second district, which includes the city of Omaha, went for Democrat [[Barack Obama]].

Despite the current Republican domination of Nebraska politics, the state has a long tradition of electing centrist members of both parties to state and federal office; examples include George Norris (who served few years in the Senate as an independent), [[J. James Exon]], and [[Bob Kerrey]]. Voters have tilted to the right in recent years with the election of conservative [[Mike Johanns]] to the U.S. Senate and the 2006 re-election of [[Ben Nelson]], who was considered the most conservative Democrat in the Senate until his retirement in 2013.

Former President [[Gerald Ford]] was born in Nebraska, but moved away shortly after birth. [[Illinois]] native [[William Jennings Bryan]] represented Nebraska in Congress, served as  [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] under President Woodrow Wilson, and unsuccessfully ran for President three times.

==Important cities and towns==
