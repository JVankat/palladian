'''West Virginia''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-West Virginia.ogg|ˌ|w|ɛ|s|t|_|v|ər|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|n|j|ə}} is a U.S. state located in the [[Appalachia]]n region of the [[Southern United States|Southern]] United States.<ref name="geography.vt.edu">[http://www.geography.vt.edu/sedaag/ Southeastern Division of the Association of American Geographers]</ref><ref>Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris, ''Encyclopedia of Southern Culture'', Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1990.</ref><ref>[http://www.census.gov/geo/www/us_regdiv.pdf U.S. Census Bureau]</ref><ref>Thomas R. Ford and Rupert Bayless Vance, ''The Southern Appalachian Region, A Survey'', Univ. of Kentucky Press, 1962</ref> It is bordered by [[Virginia]] to the southeast, [[Kentucky]] to the southwest, [[Ohio]] to the northwest, [[Pennsylvania]] to the north, and [[Maryland]] to the northeast.  West Virginia is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|41st largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|38th most populous]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]. The capital and largest city is [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].

West Virginia became a state following the [[Wheeling Convention]]s and [[Secession in the United States#West Virginia|broke away]] from [[Virginia]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The new state was admitted to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on June 20, 1863, and was a key [[Border states (Civil War)|Civil War border state]]. West Virginia was the only state to form by seceding from a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] state and was one of two states formed during the American Civil War (the other being [[Nevada]], which separated from [[Utah Territory]]).

The [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] and the [[Association of American Geographers]]<ref name="geography.vt.edu"/> classify West Virginia as part of the [[Southern United States|South]]. The northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio, with the West Virginia cities of [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] and [[Weirton, West Virginia|Weirton]] just across the border from the [[Pittsburgh]] metropolitan area, while [[Bluefield, West Virginia|Bluefield]] is less than {{convert|70|mi|km}} from [[North Carolina]]. [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] in the southwest is close to the states of Ohio and Kentucky, while [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]] and [[Harpers Ferry]] in the [[Eastern Panhandle]] region are considered part of the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] metropolitan area, in between the states of Maryland and Virginia. The unique position of West Virginia means that it is often included in several geographical regions, including the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]], the [[Upland South]], and the [[Southeastern United States]]. It is the only state that is entirely within the area served by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]; the area is commonly defined as "[[Appalachia]]".<ref name="ARC service area">{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=27 |title=Appalachian Region: Counties in Appalachia |publisher=Appalachian Regional Commission |accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref>

The state is noted for its mountains and diverse topography, its historically significant [[logging]] and [[coal mining]] industries, and its political and [[labor history (discipline)|labor history]]. It is one of the most densely [[karst]]ic areas in the world, making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research. The karst lands contribute to much of the state's cool trout waters. It is also known for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities, including [[skiing]], [[whitewater rafting]], [[fishing]], [[hiking]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[mountain biking]] and [[hunting]].

==History==
{{Main|History of West Virginia}}

Many ancient man-made earthen mounds from various prehistoric [[Mound builder (people)|mound builder cultures]] survive, especially in the areas of [[Moundsville, West Virginia|Moundsville]], [[South Charleston, West Virginia|South Charleston]], and [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]]. The artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of a village societies.  They had a tribal trade system culture that crafted [[Work hardening|cold worked]] [[copper]] pieces.

The [[Iroquois]] drove out other Native American tribes from the area to reserve the upper Ohio Valley as a hunting ground after the [[Beaver Wars]] further east.  Other indigenous tribes had occupied the area before them: the [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and other [[Siouan-language]] tribes migrated west across the [[Mississippi River]] to escape the warfare.

The area now occupied by West Virginia was contested territory among European Americans as well, with the colonies of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Virginia]] claiming territorial rights before the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Some speculative land companies, such as the [[Vandalia Company]],<ref>Charles H. Ambler, "A History of West Virginia" pg. 104</ref> and later the [[Ohio Company]] and [[Indiana Company]], tried to legitimize their claims to land in parts of West Virginia and Kentucky, but failed. With the settlement of the Pennsylvania and Virginia border dispute, which resulted in the creation of [[Kentucky]], Kentuckians "were satisfied [...], and the inhabitants of a large part of West Virginia were grateful."<ref>Charles H. Ambler. ''A History of West Virginia'', pp. 132–138</ref>

West Virginia was originally part of the British [[Virginia Colony]] (from 1607 to 1776) and the western part of the state of [[Virginia]] (from 1776 to 1863).  Long discontented with electoral malapportionment and underrepresentation in the state legislature, its residents  became sharply divided over the issue of secession from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].  Residents of western and northern counties set up a separate government under Francis Pierpont in 1861, which they called the "restored" government. Most voted to separate from Virginia, and the new state was admitted to the Union in 1863. In 1864 a state constitutional convention drafted a constitution, which was ratified by the legislature without putting it to popular vote.  West Virginia abolished [[slavery]] and temporarily disfranchised men who had held Confederate office or fought for the Confederacy.

West Virginia's history has been profoundly affected by its mountainous terrain, numerous and vast river valleys, and rich natural resources. These were all factors driving its economy and the lifestyles of its residents, and remain so today.

===Prehistory===
{{details|Prehistory of West Virginia}}
{{Further|Protohistory of West Virginia}}
A 2010 analysis of a local [[stalagmite]] revealed that native Americans were burning forests to clear land as early as 100 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/science/article/wva-stalagmite-points-to-surprising-carbon-footprint/19443425 |title=W.Va.

The online ones tend to disappear---> Some regional late-prehistoric [[Eastern Woodland]] tribes were more involved in hunting and fishing, practicing the slash and burn [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] gardening method.{{clarify|date=May 2011}} Another group progressed to the more time-consuming, advanced companion crop fields method of gardening. Also continuing from ancient [[indigenous people]] of the state, field space and time was given to [[tobacco]] growing through to early historic.

"[[Maize]] (corn) did not make a substantial contribution to the diet until after 1150 B.P.", to quote Mills (OSU 2003). Eventually, tribal villages began relying heavily on corn to feed their turkey flocks, as Kanawha Fort Ancients practiced bird [[husbandry]]. The local Indians made corn bread and a flat rye bread called "banick" as they emerged from the protohistoric era. A horizon extending from a little before the early 18th century is sometimes called the acculturating ''Fireside Cabin culture,'' when trading posts along the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[James River|James river]]s spread across the state.

Dr. Robert F. Maslowski wrote, "The [[Adena culture|Adena Indians]] used pipes for ceremonies. They were carved of stone and they were exceptional works of art. Pipes and the smoking of [[tobacco]] became more common during the Late Prehistoric period. They were often made of [[clay]] and rather plain." "Nothing is known about [[Paleo-Indian]] and Archaic houses in the [[Kanawha Valley]], but archeologists have found evidence of Woodland and Fort Ancient houses." "[[Woodland period|Woodland Indians]] lived in [[wigwams]] ... The Woodland Indians grew [[sunflowers]], [[gourds]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] and several seeds such as [[Chenopodium berlandieri|lambsquarter]], [[Cereal|may grass]], [[sumpweed]], [[smartweed]] and little [[barley]]." "[[Fort Ancient Indians]] lived in much larger square or rectangular houses ... The [[Fort Ancient Indians]] can be considered true [[farmers]]. They cultivated large agricultural fields around their villages. They no longer grew such a variety of seeds but concentrated on growing [[maize|corn]], [[beans]], [[sunflowers]], [[gourds]], and many types of [[squash (plant)|squash]] including the [[pumpkin]]. They also grew domestic [[turkeys]] and kept dogs as pets." As of 2009, over 12,500 [[archaeological]] sites have been documented in West Virginia (Bryan Ward 2009:10).<ref>The West Virginia Statewide, Historic Preservation Plan 2009-2014, West Virginia Division of Culture and History</ref>

[[File:ThomasLEE.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)|Thomas Lee]], the first manager of the [[Ohio Company]] of Virginia.]]
In 1671, General [[Abraham Wood]], at the direction of Royal Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] of the [[Virginia Colony]], sent a party from [[Fort Henry, Virginia|Fort Henry]] led by Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam that discovered [[Glen Ferris, West Virginia|Kanawha Falls]]. Some sources state that Governor [[Alexander Spotswood]]'s 1716 [[Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition]] (for which the state's Golden Horseshoe Competition for 8th graders was named) had penetrated as far as [[Pendleton County, West Virginia|Pendleton County]], however original accounts of the excursion suggest to modern historians that none of his horsemen ventured much farther west of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] than [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]]. John Van Metre, an Indian trader, penetrated into the northern portion in 1725. The same year, [[Germans|German]] settlers from [[Pennsylvania]] founded New Mecklenburg, the present [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia|Shepherdstown]], on the [[Potomac River]], and others followed.

King [[Charles II of England]], in 1661, granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the Potomac and [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] rivers, known as the [[Northern Neck]]. The grant finally came into the possession of [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], and in 1746, a [[Fairfax Stone|stone]] was erected at the source of the [[North Branch Potomac River]] to mark the western limit of the grant. A considerable part of this land was surveyed by [[George Washington]] between 1748 and 1751. The diary kept by the surveyor indicates that there were already many squatters, largely of German origin, along the [[South Branch Potomac River]]. [[Christopher Gist]], a surveyor in the employ of the first [[Ohio Company]], which was composed chiefly of Virginians, explored the country along the [[Ohio River]] north of the mouth of the [[Kanawha River]] between 1751 and 1752. The company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name "[[Vandalia (colony)|Vandalia]]". Many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750, though they were hindered by Native American resistance. Few Native Americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state, but the region was a common hunting ground, crossed by many trails. During the [[French and Indian War]] the scattered British settlements were almost destroyed.

In 1774, the Crown Governor of Virginia [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], led a force over the mountains, and a body of militia under [[Andrew Lewis (soldier)|then-Colonel Andrew Lewis]] dealt the [[Shawnee Indians]], under [[Cornstalk|Hokoleskwa]] (or "Cornstalk"), a crushing blow during the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]] at the junction of the Kanawha and the Ohio rivers. Native American attacks continued until after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. During the war, the settlers in western Virginia were generally active Whigs and many served in the [[Continental Army]].  However, Claypool's Rebellion of 1780–1781, in which a group of men refused to pay Colonial taxes showed war-weariness in West Virginia.

===Trans-Allegheny Virginia===
{{details|Virginia}}
[[Image:KitchenBall.jpg|right|thumb|A celebration at a slave wedding in Virginia, 1838]]
Social conditions in western Virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state. The population was not homogeneous, as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of Pennsylvania and included Germans, Protestant [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]], and settlers from the states farther north. Counties in the east and south were settled mostly by east Virginians. During the [[American Revolution]], the movement to create a state beyond the Alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of "[[Westsylvania]]" was presented to [[United States Congress|Congress]], on the grounds that the mountains made an almost impassable barrier on the east. The rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable, and time only increased the social, political, economic and cultural differences (''see'' [[Tuckahoe-Cohee]]) between the two sections of Virginia.<!--Why did this attempt at separation fail?-->

The convention that met in 1829 to form a new constitution for Virginia, against the protest of the counties beyond the mountains, required a property qualification for [[suffrage]] and gave the slave-holding counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population in apportioning the state's representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a result, every county beyond the Alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution, which nevertheless passed because of eastern support.

The Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850–51, the [[Reform Convention]], addressed a number of issues important to western Virginians. The vote was extended to all white males of 21 years of age plus. The governor, lieutenant-governor, the judiciary, sheriffs and other county officers were to be elected by public vote. The composition of the General Assembly was changed, representation in the house of delegates was apportioned on the white basis of the census of 1850, but the Senate was fixed arbitrarily, the west receiving twenty, and the east thirty, senators. This was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the General Assembly to reapportion representation on the white basis in 1865, or else put the matter to a public referendum. But the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value, except for slaves. Slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed, and slaves over that age were taxed at only $300, a fraction of their true value. Small farmers, however, had all their assets, animals and land, taxed at full value. Despite this tax and the lack of [[internal improvements]] in the west, the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new Constitution, most of the latter being from eastern counties, which did not like the compromises made for the west.<ref>Charles H. Amber, "A History of West Virginia", pgs. 276–79</ref>

Given the differences, many in the west had long contemplated a separate state.  In particular, men like the lawyer [[Francis H. Pierpont]] from Fairmont, had long chafed under the political domination of the Tidewater and Piedmont slave-holders.  In addition to differences over the abolition of slavery, it was felt the Virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west, such as turnpikes and railroads.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/the-birth-of-a-state/ | title=The Birth of a State | publisher=New York Times | date=July 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 27, 2012 | author=Grady, John}}</ref>

Missing from both lists, however, are the delegates for McDowell County, William P. Cecil and Samuel L. Graham, who also represented Tazewell and Buchanan counties, which are still part of Virginia. Both Cecil and Graham voted in favor of the Ordinance. See Pendleton, William C. ''History of Tazewell County and Southwest Virginia, 1748–1920'', Richmond, 1920, pgs. 600 and 603.</ref> and 2 abstentions.<ref>Those not voting were Thomas Maslin of Hardy County and Benjamin Wilson of Harrison County. Ambler, Charles H. ''A History of West Virginia'', pg. 309, footnote 32.</ref> Almost immediately after the vote to proceed with [[secession]] from the Union prevailed in the Virginia General Assembly, a mass meeting at [[Clarksburg, West Virginia|Clarksburg]] recommended that each county in northwestern Virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] on May 13, 1861. When this First [[Wheeling Convention]] met, 425 delegates from 25 counties were present, though more than one-third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area,<ref>J. McGregor "The Disruption of Virginia", pg. 193</ref> but soon there was a division of sentiment.

Some delegates favored the immediate formation of a new state, while others argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum, such action would constitute revolution against the United States.<ref>The [[United States Constitution]] provides that no state may be divided without its consent.</ref> It was decided that if the ordinance were adopted (of which there was little doubt), another convention including the members-elect of the legislature should meet at Wheeling in June. At the election on May 23, 1861, secession was ratified by a large majority in the state as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the Ordinance.<ref>Richard O. Curry "A House Divided", pg. 147</ref>

The Second Wheeling Convention met as agreed on June 11 and declared that, since the Secession Convention had been called without the consent of the people, all its acts were void, and that all who adhered to it had vacated their offices. The Wheeling Conventions, and the delegates themselves, were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western Virginia.<ref>C. Ambler "The History of West Virginia", pg. 318</ref> An act for the reorganization of the government was passed on June 19. The next day [[Francis H. Pierpont]] was chosen by other delegates at the convention to be governor of Virginia, other officers were elected and the convention adjourned. The legislature was composed of 103 members, 33 of whom had been elected to the Virginia General Assembly<ref>Virgil Lewis "How West Virginia Was Made" pgs. 79–80</ref> on May 23.

This number included some hold-over Senators from 1859, and as such had vacated their offices to convene in Wheeling. The other members "were chosen even more irregularly—some in mass meetings, others by county committee, and still others were seemingly self-appointed"<ref>Charles Ambler "The History of West Virginia", pg. 318</ref> This irregular assembly met on June 20 and appointed Unionists to hold the remainder of the state offices, organized a rival state government and elected two United States senators who were promptly recognized by the federal government in Washington, D.C. Thus, there were two state governments in Virginia, one pledging allegiance to the United States and one to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

The Wheeling Convention, which had taken a recess until August 6, reassembled on August 20, and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable. At the October 24, 1861 election, 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against. The honesty of these election results has been questioned, since the Union army then occupied the area and Union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent Confederate sympathizers from voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/statehoo.html |title=West Virginia Statehood |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> Most of the affirmative votes came from 16 counties around the Northern panhandle.<ref>Richard O. Curry "A House Divided", pgs. 141–152</ref> Over 50,000 votes had been cast on the Ordinance of Secession, yet the vote on statehood gathered little more than 19,000. [[File:WVStatehoodVote.png|thumb| Statehood vote of Oct. 24, 1861]]In Ohio County, home to Wheeling, only about one-quarter of the registered voters cast votes.<ref>Richard O. Curry "A House Divided", pg. 149</ref> At the Constitutional Convention in November 1861, Mr. Lamb of Ohio County and Mr. Carskadon said that in Hampshire County, out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state; the rest were cast illegally by Union soldiers.<ref>J. McGregor "The Disruption of Virginia", pg. 270</ref> In most of what would become West Virginia, there was no vote at all as two-thirds of the territory of West Virginia had voted for secession and county officers were still loyal to Richmond.<ref>Richard O. Curry "A House Divided" map, pg. 49</ref> Votes recorded from pro-secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by Unionist refugees from these counties.<ref>Richard O. Curry "A House Divided", pg. 86</ref> The convention began on November 26, 1861, and finished its work on February 18, 1862; the instrument was ratified (18,162 for and 514 against) on April 11, 1862.

On May 13 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state. An application for admission to the Union was made to Congress, and on December 31, 1862, an enabling act was approved by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] admitting West Virginia, on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution. While many felt that West Virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln issued his Opinion on the Admission of West Virginia finding that "the body which consents to the admission of West Virginia, is the Legislature of Virginia," and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/lincolnopinion.html |title=Opinion of Abraham Lincoln on the Admission of West Virginia |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>

The convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met. The revised constitution was adopted on March 26, 1863, and on April 20, 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state at the end of 60 days (June 20, 1863). Meanwhile, officers for the new state were chosen, while Gov. Pierpont moved his pro-Union Virginia capital to Union-occupied [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all of the remaining Virginia counties within the federal lines.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:FirstConfederateMemorial.JPG|thumb|right|[[First Confederate Memorial]], [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]].]] -->
The question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was brought before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the following manner: [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson]] counties lying on the Potomac east of the mountains, in 1863, with the consent of the reorganized government of Virginia voted in favor of annexation to West Virginia. Many voters of the strongly pro-secessionist counties were absent in the Confederate Army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer upon their return. The [[Virginia General Assembly]] repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against West Virginia, asking the court to declare the counties a part of Virginia which would have declared West Virginia's admission as a state unconstitutional. Meanwhile, on March 10, 1866, Congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer. The Supreme Court, in 1870, decided in favor of West Virginia.<ref>''[[Virginia v. West Virginia]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=78&page=39 78 U.S. 39 (1870)].</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]], West Virginia suffered comparatively little. Union General [[George B. McClellan]]'s forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861, culminating at the [[Battle of Rich Mountain]], and Union control was never again seriously threatened, despite an attempt by [[Robert E. Lee]] in the same year. In 1863, General [[John D. Imboden]], with 5,000 Confederates, overran a considerable portion of the state. Bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections, and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended. The Eastern Panhandle counties were more affected by the war, with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands.

The area which became West Virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and Confederate armies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/History/civwaran.html |title=Researching Your Civil War Ancestor |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref>  approximately 22,000–25,000 each. The Wheeling government found it necessary in 1865 to strip voting rights from returning Confederates in order to retain control. James Ferguson, who proposed the law, said that if it was not enacted he would lose election by 500 votes.<ref>Charles Ambler "Disfranchisement in West Virginia", Yale Review, 1905, pg. 41</ref> The property of Confederates might also be confiscated, and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the Confederacy was adopted. The addition of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendments]] to the United States Constitution caused a reaction. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic party]] secured control in 1870, and in 1871, the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated. The first steps toward this change had been taken, however, by the [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] in 1870. On August 22, 1872, an entirely new constitution was adopted.

Beginning in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], and for several decades thereafter, the two states disputed the new state's share of the pre-war Virginia government's debts, which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements, such as canals, roads, and railroads under the [[Virginia Board of Public Works]]. Virginians, led by former Confederate General [[William Mahone]], formed a political coalition which was based upon this, the [[Readjuster Party]]. Although West Virginia's first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the Virginia debt, negotiations opened by Virginia in 1870 were fruitless, and in 1871, Virginia funded two-thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to West Virginia. The issue was finally settled in 1915, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50. The final installment of this sum was paid in 1939.

===Development of natural resources===

After [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the new 35th state benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other single economic activity.

[[Potassium nitrate|Saltpeter]] caves had been employed throughout Appalachia for munitions; the border between West Virginia and [[Virginia]] includes the "Saltpeter Trail", a string of [[limestone]] [[cave]]rns containing rich deposits of [[calcium nitrate]] that were rendered and sold to the government.  The trail stretched from [[Pendleton County, West Virginia|Pendleton County]] to the western terminus of the route in the town of [[Union, Monroe County, West Virginia|Union]], [[Monroe County, West Virginia|Monroe County]].  Nearly half of these caves are on the West Virginia side, including [[Organ Cave]] and [[Haynes Cave]].  In the late 18th-century, saltpeter miners in [[Haynes Cave]] found large animal bones in the deposits.  These were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier Colonel John Stuart to [[Thomas Jefferson]].  The bones were named [[Megalonyx jeffersonii]] or great-claw and became known as Jefferson's Three-toed Sloth.  It was declared the official [[state fossil]] of West Virginia in 2008. The West Virginia official [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|state rock]] is [[bituminous coal]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Bill_Text_HTML/2009_SESSIONS/RS/BILLS/hcr37%20intr.htm |title=West Virginia House Concurrent Resolution No. 37, signed into law June&nbsp;2009 |accessdate=2010-02-18 |publisher=State of West Virginia}}</ref> and the official [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|state gemstone]] is silicified Mississippian fossil Lithostrotionella coral.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvcommerce.org/travel/requestinformation/statefacts.aspx |title=State Facts |accessdate=2009-11-12 |publisher=State of West Virginia}}</ref>

The limestone also produced a useful [[quarry]] industry, usually small, and softer, high-calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime.  This lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes; for many years a specific portion of the [[C & O Railroad]] carried limestone rock to [[Clifton Forge, Virginia]] as an industrial flux.

[[Salt]] mining had been underway since the 18th century, though it had largely played out by the time of the American Civil War, when the red salt of [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]] was a valued commodity of first Confederate, and later Union forces. Later, more sophisticated mining methods would restore West Virginia's role as a major producer of salt.

However, in the second half of the 19th century, there was an even greater treasure not yet developed, [[bituminous coal]]. It would fuel much of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the U.S. and the steamships of many of the world's navies.

The residents (both Native Americans and early European settlers) had long known of the underlying coal, and that it could be used for heating and fuel. However, for a long time, very small "personal" mines were the only practical development. After the War, with the new [[railroad]]s came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding U.S. and export markets. As the [[anthracite]] mines of northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period, investors and industrialists focused new interest in West Virginia. [[Geologist]]s such as Dr. [[David T. Ansted]] surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects.

The completion of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) across the state to the new city of [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] on the [[Ohio River]] in 1872 opened access to the [[New River (West Virginia)|New River]] Coal Field. Soon, the C&O was building its huge [[coal pier]] at [[Newport News, Virginia]] on the large harbor of [[Hampton Roads]]. In 1881, the new Philadelphia-based owners of the former [[Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad]] (AM&O), which stretched across Virginia's southern tier from [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], had sights clearly set on the Mountain State, where the owners had large land holdings. Their railroad was renamed [[Norfolk and Western]] (N&W), and a new railroad city was developed at [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] to handle planned expansion. After its new president [[Frederick J. Kimball]] and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam which his wife named "Pocahontas", the N&W redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it. Soon, the N&W was also shipping from new coal piers at Hampton Roads.

In 1889, in the southern part of the state, along the Norfolk and Western rail lines, the important coal center of [[Bluefield, West Virginia]] was founded. The "capital" of the [[Pocahontas coalfield]], this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades. It shares a sister city with the same name, Bluefield, in Virginia.

In the northern portion of the state and elsewhere, the older [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities. The B&O developed coal piers in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and at several points on the [[Great Lakes]]. Other significant rail carriers of coal were the [[Western Maryland Railway]] (WM), [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] (SOU), and the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] (L&N).

Particularly notable was a latecomer, the [[Virginian Railway]] (VGN). By 1900, only a large area of the most rugged terrain of southern West Virginia was any distance from the existing railroads and mining activity. Within this area west of the New River Coalfield in Raleigh and Wyoming counties lay the [[Winding Gulf Coalfield]], later promoted as the "Billion Dollar Coalfield."

A protégé of Dr. Ansted was [[William N. Page|William Nelson Page]] (1854–1932), a [[civil engineer]] and mining manager in [[Fayette County, West Virginia|Fayette County]]. Former West Virginia Governor [[William A. MacCorkle]] described him as a man who knew the land "as a farmer knows a field." Beginning in 1898, Page teamed with northern and European-based investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area. They acquired large tracts of land in the area, and Page began the [[Deepwater Railway]], a [[short-line railroad]] which was chartered to stretch between the C&O at its line along the [[Kanawha River]] and the N&W at [[Matoaka, West Virginia|Matoaka]], a distance of about {{convert|80|mi|km}}.

Although the Deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad, leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme. In secret collusion, each declined to negotiate favorable rates with Page, nor did they offer to purchase his railroad, as they had many other short-lines. However, if the C&O and N&W presidents thought they could thus kill the Page project, they were to be proved mistaken. One of the [[Partnership|silent partner]] investors Page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]], a principal in [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil Trust]] and an old hand at developing natural resources and transportation. A master at competitive "warfare", Henry Rogers did not like to lose in his endeavors and also had [[deep pocket|"deep pockets"]].

Instead of giving up, Page (and Rogers) quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across Virginia, using Rogers' private fortune to finance the $40-million cost. When the renamed [[Virginian Railway]] (VGN) was completed in 1909, no fewer than three railroads were shipping ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from Hampton Roads. West Virginia coal was also under high demand at [[Great Lakes]] ports. The VGN and the N&W ultimately became parts of the modern [[Norfolk Southern]] system, and the VGN's well-engineered 21st-century tracks continue to offer a favorable gradient to Hampton Roads.

As coal mining and related work became major employment activities in the state, there was considerable labor strife as working conditions, safety issues and economic concerns arose. Even in the 21st century, mining safety and ecological concerns is still challenging to the state whose coal continues to power electrical generating plants in many other states.

Coal is not the only valuable mineral found in West Virginia, as the state was the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34.48 carat (6.896 g) [[Jones Diamond]].

===Geology and terrain===
{{Main|Geology of West Virginia}}
[[File:Spruce Knob.jpg|right|thumb|The summit of [[Spruce Knob]] is often covered in clouds.]]

West Virginia is located entirely within the Appalachian Region, and the state is almost entirely mountainous, giving reason to the nickname ''The Mountain State'' and the motto ''Montani Semper Liberi'' ("Mountaineers are always free"). The elevations and ruggedness drop near large rivers like the Ohio River or [[Shenandoah River]]. About 75% of the state is within the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Allegheny Plateau]] regions. Though the relief is not high, the plateau region is extremely rugged in most areas. The average elevation of West Virginia is approximately {{convert|1500|ft|m}} above sea level, which is the highest of any US state east of the Mississippi River.

On the eastern state line with [[Virginia]], high peaks in the [[Monongahela National Forest]] region give rise to an island of colder [[climate]] and [[ecosystem]]s similar to those of northern [[New England]] and eastern Canada. The highest point in the state is atop [[Spruce Knob]], at {{convert|4863|ft|m|abbr=on}},<ref name=usgs>{{cite web| date =April 29, 2005 | url =http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest| title =Elevations and Distances in the United States| publisher=U.S Geological Survey| accessdate = 2006-11-09}}</ref> and is covered in a [[boreal forest]] of dense [[spruce]] trees at altitudes above {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. Spruce Knob lies within the Monongahela National Forest and is a part of the [[Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/mnf/sp/sksrnra.html |title=FS.fed.us |publisher=FS.fed.us |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> A total of six [[wilderness]] areas can also be found within the forest. Outside the forest to the south, the New River Gorge is a canyon {{convert|1000|ft|m}} deep, carved by the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]]. The [[National Park Service]] manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the [[New River Gorge National River]], one of only 15 rivers in the U.S. with this level of protection.

Other areas under protection and management include:

Most of West Virginia lies within the [[Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests]] [[ecoregion]], while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the [[Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests]]. The native [[vegetation]] for most of the state was originally mixed [[hardwood]] [[forest]] of oak, [[chestnut]], [[maple]], [[beech]], and [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]], with [[willow]] and [[American sycamore]] along the state's waterways. Many of the areas are rich in [[biodiversity]] and scenic beauty, a fact that is appreciated by native West Virginians, who refer to their home as ''Almost Heaven'' (from the song, "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" by [[John Denver]]). Before the song, it was known as "The Cog State" (Coal, Oil, and Gas) or "The Mountain State".

The underlying rock strata are [[sandstone]], [[shale]], [[bituminous coal]] beds, and [[limestone]] laid down in a near-shore environment from [[sediment]]s derived from mountains to the east, in a shallow inland sea on the west. Some beds illustrate a coastal swamp environment, some river delta, some shallow water. Sea level rose and fell many times during the [[Mississippian]] and [[Pennsylvanian]] eras, giving a variety of rock [[stratum|strata]]. The Appalachian Mountains are some of the oldest on earth, having formed over 300&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>Peter J Coney (1970). "The Geotectonic Cycle and the New Global Tectonics" .

The climate of West Virginia is a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') in some of the lower elevations, primarily in the southwestern portion of the state (including [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] and [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]), along with parts of the [[Eastern Panhandle]] east of the Appalachians with hot, humid summers and milder winters. The rest of the state generally has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'', except ''Dfb'' at the higher elevations) with warm to hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters, increasing in severity with elevation. Some southern highland areas also have a mountain temperate climate (Köppen ''Cfb'') where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are somewhat cooler. However, the weather is subject in all parts of the state to change. The [[hardiness zone]]s range from zone 5b in the central [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest elevations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-west-virginia-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=West Virginia USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=plantmaps.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref>
In the Eastern Panhandle and the [[Ohio River]] Valley, temperatures are warm enough to see and grow subtropical plants such as Southern magnolia (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]''), [[Lagerstroemia|Crepe Myrtle]], [[Albizia julibrissin]], [[American Sweetgum]] and even the occasional [[needle palm]] and [[sabal minor]]. These plants do not thrive as well in other parts of the state. The [[Eastern prickly pear]] grows well in many portions of the state.

Average January temperatures range from around 26 °F (−4 °C) near the [[Cheat River]] to 41 °F (5 °C) along sections of the border with Kentucky. July averages range from 67 °F (19 °C) along the [[North Branch Potomac River]] to 76 °F (24 °C) in the western part of the state. It is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state.<ref name="climates">{{cite web|title=West Virginia University data|url=http://www.health.wvu.edu/employment/live/clim_quickfacts.aspx|publisher=West Virginia University Health Office|accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref> The highest recorded temperature in the state is {{convert|112|F|C}} at [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]] on July 10, 1936 and the lowest recorded temperature in the state is {{convert|-37|F|C}} at [[Lewisburg, West Virginia|Lewisburg]] on December 30, 1917.

Annual precipitation ranges from less than {{convert|32|in|cm}} in the lower eastern section to more than {{convert|56|in|cm}} in higher parts of the Allegheny Front. Slightly more than half the rainfall occurs from April to September. Dense fogs are common in many valleys of the [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha]] section, especially the [[Tygart Valley]]. West Virginia is also one of the cloudiest states in the nation, with the cities of [[Elkins, West Virginia|Elkins]] and [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]] ranking 9th and 10th in the U.S. respectively for the number of cloudy days per year (over 210). In addition to persistent cloudy skies caused by the damming of moisture by the Alleghenies, West Virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation, with [[Snowshoe, WV|Snowshoe]] averaging nearly 200 days a year with either rain or snow. Snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections but may persist for weeks in the higher mountain areas. An average of {{convert|34|in|cm}} of snow falls annually in Charleston, although during the winter of 1995–1996 more than three times that amount fell as several cities in the state established new records for snowfall. Average snowfall in the Allegheny Highlands can range up to {{convert|180|in|cm}} per year. Severe weather is somewhat less prevalent in West Virginia than in most other eastern states, and it ranks among the least tornado-prone states east of the Rockies.

At the 2010 Census, the racial composition of the states population was:
* 93.2% of the population was [[non-Hispanic White]]
* 3.4% non-Hispanic Black or [[African American]]
* 0.2% non-Hispanic [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] and [[Alaska Native]]
* 0.7% non-Hispanic [[Asian American]]
* 0.1% from some other race (non-Hispanic) 
* 1.3% [[Multiracial American]] (non-Hispanic).

In the same year, 1.2% of West Virginia's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).

As of 2012, West Virginia has an estimated population of 1,855,413, which is an increase of 49, or 0.0%, from the prior year and an increase of 2,414, or 0.13%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural decrease since the last census of 3,296 people (that is 108,292 births minus 111,588 deaths) and an increase from net [[Human migration|migration]] of 14,209 people into the state. West Virginia is the least populous [[Southeastern United States|southeastern state]]. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 3,691 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 10,518 people.

Only 1.1% of the state's residents were foreign-born, placing West Virginia last among the 50 states in that statistic. It also has the lowest percentage of residents that speak a language other than English in the home (2.7%).

The five largest ancestry groups in West Virginia are: [[English American|English]] (35.2%), [[German American|German]] (17.2%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (8%), [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] (5%) and [[Italian American|Italian]] (4.8%).  In the 2000 Census People who identified their ethnicity as simply "American" made up 18.8% of the population. Many of these people are of [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry, and many are of [[English American|English]] descent as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-context=qt&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-tree_id=403&-all_geo_types=N&-redoLog=true&-_caller=geoselect&-geo_id=04000US54&-search_results=01000US&-format=&-_lang=en |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}</ref>

Large numbers of people of [[Germans|German]] ancestry are present in the northeastern counties of the state.  People of [[English American|English]] ancestry are present throughout the entire state.   Many West Virginians who self-identify as [[Irish American|Irish]] are actually [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] Protestants.

5.6% of West Virginia's population were reported as under 5, 22.3% under 18, and 15.3% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 51.4% of the population.

There were 20,928 births in 2006. Of these, 19,757 (94.40% of the births, 95.19% of the population) were to Non-Hispanic Whites. There were 22 births to American Indians (0.11% of the births and 0.54% of the population), 177 births to Asians (0.85% of the births and 0.68% of the population), 219 births to Hispanics (1.05% of the births and 0.88% of the population) and 753 births to Blacks and others (3.60% of the births and 3.56% of the population).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr56/nvsr56_07.pdf |title=National Vital Statistics Reports, Volume 56, Number 7, (12/5/07) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>

Several surveys have been made in recent years, in 2008 by the American Religion Identity Survey,<ref>[http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/aris-2008-summary-report/ ARIS 2008 Summary Report | ARIS 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and in 2010 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.<ref>[http://religions.pewforum.org/ Religion in American Culture - Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The Pew survey results admit to a 6.5% margin of error plus or minus, while the ARIS survey states that "estimates are subject to larger sampling errors in states with small populations." A characteristic of religion in Appalachian communities is the abundance of independent, non-affiliated churches, which "remain unnoted and uncounted in any census of church life in the United States." This sometimes leads to the belief that these communities are "unchurched".<ref>[http://utpress.org/Appalachia/EntryDisplay.php?EntryID=013 Old-Time Religion, Encyclopedia of Appalachia]</ref>

West Virginia is also home to the [[Green Bank Telescope]] at the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]]. The largest hand-cut sandstone building in North America, second only to the Kremlin in Moscow, is also located in West Virginia. [[Tours]] are offered of the [[Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum]], a [[National Historic Landmark]] and member of the [[National Civil War Trail]] seasonally, and by appointment year round.

===Resources===
[[File:Coalseam 8618.JPG|right|thumb|Bituminous coal seam in southwestern West Virginia]]
One of the major resources in West Virginia's economy is [[coal]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], West Virginia is a top coal-producer in the United States, second only to Wyoming. West Virginia also produces large amounts of [[natural gas]] and a fair amount of oil.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} West Virginia is located in the heart of the Marcellus Shale Natural Gas Bed, which stretches from Tennessee north to New York in the middle of Appalachia.

Nearly all of the electricity generated in West Virginia is from coal-fired power plants. West Virginia produces a surplus of electricity and leads the Nation in net interstate electricity exports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=WV |title= EIA State Energy Profiles: West Virginia |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> Farming is also practiced in West Virginia, but on a limited basis because of the mountainous terrain over much of the state.

Logging is also a big producer in West Virginia because of the overpopulation of deciduous forest all across the state.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Oak, cherry, poplar, maple, and pine are just a few of the various trees often harvested in the state.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Wind generation===
West Virginia has the potential to generate 4,952 GWh/year from 1,883 MW of wind power, using 80 meter high wind turbines, or 8,627 GWh/year from 2,772 MW of 100 meter wind turbines, and 60,000 GWh from 40,000 MW of photovoltaics, including 3,810 MW of rooftop photovoltaics.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/gis/re_potential.html Renewable Energy Technical Potential]</ref>

===Taxes===
West Virginia personal [[income tax]] is based on federal adjusted gross income (not taxable income), as modified by specific items in West Virginia law. Citizens are taxed within five income brackets, which range from 3.0 percent to 6.5 percent. The state's consumer [[sales tax]] is levied at 6 percent. Effective January 1, 2004, calculation of WV consumer sales tax has been converted to a calculated figure from the bracket system, and remains at 6 percent for most goods (some food goods are now taxable at 2 percent<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wva.state.wv.us/wvtax/foodtax.aspx |title=Food Tax  |publisher=State of West Virginia |accessdate=August 21, 2012 }}</ref>). The computation of tax is carried out to the third decimal place and rounded up when the third decimal place is five (.005) or higher; and similarly rounded down if the third place is four (.004) or lower. By virtue of this method, sales totaling $0.08 and below would not have a sales tax associated with them.<ref>[http://www.state.wv.us/taxrev/taxdoc/tsd1.htm WV State Tax Department&nbsp;– TSD Publications]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>

West Virginia counties administer and collect [[property tax]]es, although property tax rates reflect levies for state government, county governments, county boards of education and municipalities. Counties may also impose a hotel occupancy tax on lodging places not located within the city limits of any municipality that levies such a tax. Municipalities may levy license and [[gross receipts tax]]es on businesses located within the city limits and a hotel occupancy tax on lodging places in the city. Although the Department of Tax and Revenue plays a major role in the administration of this tax, less than one-half of 1 percent of the property tax collected goes to state government.

The primary beneficiaries of the property tax are county boards of education. Property taxes are paid to the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] of each of the state's 55 counties. Each county and municipality can impose its own rates of property taxation within the limits set by the West Virginia Constitution. The West Virginia legislature sets the rate of tax of county boards of education. This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide. However, the total tax rate for county boards of education may differ from county to county because of excess levies. The Department of Tax and Revenue supervises and otherwise assists counties and municipalities in their work of assessment and tax rate determination. The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities: state, county, schools and municipal. This total tax rate varies for each of the four classes of property, which consists of personal, real and intangible properties. Property is assessed according to its use, location and value as of July 1. All property is reappraised every three years; annual adjustments are made to assessments for property with a change of value. West Virginia does not impose an [[inheritance tax]]. Because of the phase-out of the federal [[estate tax]] credit, West Virginia's estate tax is not imposed on estates of persons who died on or after January 1, 2005.<ref>[http://www.state.wv.us/taxrev/taxdoc/tsd393.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|Law and government of West Virginia|West Virginia Constitution}}
[[File:WV State Capitol.jpg|thumb|right|The West Virginia State Capitol.]]

West Virginia's capital and seat of government is the city of [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]], located in the southwest area of the state.

===Legislative branch===
{{Further|West Virginia Legislature}}
The West Virginia Legislature is [[bicameral]]. It consists of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and the [[West Virginia Senate|Senate]]. It is a citizen's legislature, meaning that legislative office is not a full-time occupation, but rather a part-time position. Consequently, the legislators often hold a full-time job in their community of residence.

Typically, the legislature is in session for 60 days between January and early April. The final day of the regular session ends in a bewildering fury of last-minute legislation in order to meet a constitutionally imposed deadline of midnight. During the remainder of the year, monthly interim sessions are held in preparation for the regular session. Legislators also gather periodically for 'special' sessions when called by the governor.

The title of [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|Lieutenant Governor]] is assigned by statute to the [[Lieutenant Governor of West Virginia|Senate President]].

===Executive branch===
{{Further|List of Governors of West Virginia}}
The governor, elected every four years on the same day as the U.S. Presidential election, is sworn in during the following January.

Governors of West Virginia can serve two consecutive terms but must sit out a term before serving a third term in office.

The title of [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|Lieutenant Governor]] is assigned by statute to the [[Lieutenant Governor of West Virginia|Senate President]].

===Judicial branch===
{{Further|Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia}}
West Virginia is one of thirteen states that do not have a [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], and it is the only state in the southeastern United States to have abolished it.

For the purpose of courts of general jurisdiction, the state is divided into 31 judicial circuits. Each circuit is made up of one or more counties. Circuit judges are elected in partisan elections to serve eight-year terms.

West Virginia’s highest court is the Supreme Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia is the busiest appellate court of its type in the United States. West Virginia is one of 11 states with a single appellate court. The state constitution allows for the creation of an intermediate court of appeals, but the Legislature has never created one. The Supreme Court is made up of five justices, elected in partisan elections to 12-year terms.

West Virginia is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]. However, unlike most such states, it does not operate retail outlets, having exited that business in 1990. It retains a monopoly on wholesaling of [[distilled spirits]] only.

===Elections===
{{Main|Elections in West Virginia|Political party strength in West Virginia}}

At the state level, West Virginia's politics are largely dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], with Democrats currently holding the governorship, both senate seats and both houses of the state legislature.  This is a legacy of West Virginia's very strong tradition of union membership. Since 2000, however, Republicans have done increasingly well in national elections.  They currently hold two of the state's three House seats.

Since [[2000 US Presidential Election|2000]], West Virginians have supported the Republican candidate in every presidential election. In the [[2012 US Presidential Election|2012 presidential election]] Republican [[Mitt Romney]] won the state defeating Democrat [[Barack Obama]] with 62% of the vote to 35% for Obama.  Before 2000, West Virginia had been reckoned as a Democratic stronghold at the national level.  From 1932 to 1996, the state only went Republican three times—in the national Republican landslides of 1956, 1972 and 1984.

Highways form the backbone of transportation systems in West Virginia, with over {{convert|37300|mi|km}} of public roads in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvdot.com/3_roadways/3_roadways.htm |title=West Virginia Department of Transportation, accessed June 9, 2006 |publisher=Wvdot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> Airports, railroads, and rivers complete the commercial transportation modes for West Virginia. Commercial air travel is facilitated by airports in Charleston, Huntington, Morgantown, Beckley, Lewisburg, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg, however only Charleston and Huntington are unsubsidized by the [[Essential Air Service|EAS]] program. The cities of Charleston, Huntington, Beckley, Wheeling, Morgantown, Clarksburg, and Fairmont have bus-based public transit systems, and the Huntington and Charleston systems joinly operate a twice per weekday interconnecting service.

[[West Virginia University]] in Morgantown boasts the [[Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit|PRT (personal rapid transit) system]], the state's only single rail public transit system. Developed by [[Boeing]], the WVU School of Engineering and the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], it was a model for low-capacity light transport designed for smaller cities. Recreational transportation opportunities abound in West Virginia, including hiking trails,<ref>de Hart, A, and Sundquist, B., Monongahela National Forest Hiking Guide, West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Charleston, WV 1993.</ref> [[rail trails]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvrtc.org |title=West Virginia Rails-to-Trails Council, accessed 9 June 2006 |publisher=Wvrtc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> ATV off road trails,<ref>{{cite web|author=Southern West Virginia |url=http://www.trailsheaven.com/ |title=Hatfield and McCoys Trail web site, accessed June 6, 2006 |publisher=Trailsheaven.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> white water rafting rivers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvwhitewater.com/ |title=WV White Water web site, access June 6, 2006 |publisher=Wvwhitewater.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> and two tourist railroads ([[Cass Scenic Railroad]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cassrailroad.com/ |title=Cass Scenic Railroad web site, accessed 6 June 9, 2006 |publisher=Cassrailroad.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> and the [[South Branch Valley Railroad|Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potomaceagle.info/ |title=Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad, accessed June 6, 2006 |publisher=Potomaceagle.info |date=February 20, 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>

West Virginia is crossed by six [[interstate highways]]. [[I-64]] enters the state near [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia|White Sulphur Springs]] in the mountainous east, and exits for [[Kentucky]] in the west, near [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]]. [[I-77]] enters from [[Virginia]] in the south, near [[Bluefield, West Virginia|Bluefield]]. It runs north past [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]] before it crosses into [[Ohio]]. [[I-64]] and [[I-77]] between Charleston and Beckley are merged as toll road known as the [[West Virginia Turnpike]], which continues as I-77 alone from Beckley to Princeton.  It was constructed beginning in 1952 as a two lane road, but rebuilt beginning in 1974 to interstate standards.  Today almost nothing of the original construction remains. [[I-68]]'s western terminus is in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]]. From there it runs east into [[Maryland]]. At the [[I-68]] terminus in Morgantown, it meets [[I-79]], which enters from Pennsylvania and runs through the state to its southern terminus in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]. [[I-70]] briefly runs through West Virginia, crossing the northern panhandle through [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]], while [[I-470]] is a bypass of Wheeling (making Wheeling among the smallest cities with an interstate bypass).   [[I-81]] also briefly runs in West Virginia through the [[Eastern Panhandle]] where it goes through [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]].

The interstates are supplemented by roads constructed under the Appalachian Corridor system.  Four Corridors are complete.  Corridor D, carrying US 50, runs from the Ohio River, and I-77, at Parkersburg to I-79 at Clarksburg.  Corridor G, carrying US 119, runs from Charleston to the Kentucky border at Williamson.  Corridor L, carrying US 19, runs from the Turnpike at Beckley to I-79 near Sutton (and provides a short cut of about 40 miles and bypasses Charleston's urban traffic for traveler heading to and from Florida).  Corridor Q, carrying US 460, runs through Mercer County, entering the state from [[Giles County, Virginia]] and then reentering Virginia at [[Tazewell County, Virginia|Tazewell County]].

Work continues on the long delayed Corridor H, which will carry US 48 from Weston to the Virginia line near Wardensville.  As of 2013, a section from Weston to Elkins, and another section from Wardensville to near Scher are complete.  Other projects under development are a four-lane upgrade of US 35 from Scott Depot to the Ohio River at Point Pleasant, which is about two-thirds complete; a four lane upgrade of WV 10 from Logan to Man and then of WV 80 from Man to Gilbert, which is about one-third complete; and four lane upgrades to US 52 from Bluefield to Williamson, known as the "King Coal Highway" and from Williamson to Huntington, known as the "Tolsia Highway" which are many years from completion.  A project is also ongoing known as the "Coalfields Expressway" which will carry US 121 from Beckley west across Raleigh, Wyoming, and McDowell counties, entering Virginia near Bishop.
  
Rail lines in the state used to be more prevalent, but many lines have been discontinued because of increased automobile traffic. Many old tracks have been converted to [[rail trails]] for recreational use, although the coal producing areas still have railroads running at near capacity.   [[Amtrak]]'s Cardinal roughly parallels I-64's path through the state.  [[MARC Train|MARC]] trains serve commuters in the eastern panhandle. In 2006 [[Norfolk Southern]] along with the West Virginia and U.S. Government approved a plan to modify many of the rail tunnels in West Virginia, especially in the southern half of the state, to allow for double stacked cars (see [[Intermodal freight transport|inter-modal freight]]). This is expected to also help bring economic growth to the southern half of the state.  An Intermodal Freight Facility is underconstruction near Prichard, south of Huntington.

Because of the mountainous nature of the entire state, West Virginia has several notable tunnels and bridges. The most famous of these is the [[New River Gorge Bridge]], which was at a time the longest steel single-arch bridge in the world with a 3,031-foot (924 m) span. The bridge is also pictured on the West Virginia [[state quarter]]. The Fort Steuben Bridge (Weirton-Steubenville Bridge) was at its time of construction one of only three cable-stayed steel girder trusses in the United States. "The Veterans Memorial Bridge was designed to handle traffic from the Fort Steuben Bridge as well as its own traffic load," to quote the ''Weirton Daily Times'' newspaper.<ref name="Gossett Fort Steuben Bridge permanently closed">{{Cite news|url=http://www.weirtondailytimes.com/page/content.detail/id/515883.html|title=Fort Steuben Bridge permanently closed |last=Gossett|first=Dave|date=January 15, 2009 |work=Weirton Daily Times |accessdate=2009-02-02 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5eI7HnDFb|archivedate=February 2, 2009}}</ref> The 80-year-old Fort Steuben Bridge (Weirton-Steubenville Bridge) was permanently closed on January 8, 2009.  The [[Wheeling Suspension Bridge]] was the first bridge built across the [[Ohio River]] in 1849 and for a time was the longest suspension bridge in the world.  It is still the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use.
