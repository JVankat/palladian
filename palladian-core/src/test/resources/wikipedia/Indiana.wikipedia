'''Indiana''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Indiana.ogg|ɪ|n|d|i|ˈ|æ|n|ə}} is a [[U.S. state]] located in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes]] regions of North America. Indiana is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|38th largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|16th most populous]] of the [[50 United States]]. Indiana is the least extensive state in the [[contiguous United States]] west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Indianapolis]]. Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th U.S. state on December 11, 1816.

Before it became a territory, varying cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] and historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and from adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends|title=Indiana – Settlement patterns and demographic trends|publisher=eb.com|author=William Vincent D’Antonio & Robert L.

[[Economy of Indiana|Indiana has a diverse economy]] with a gross state product of $214&nbsp;billion in 2005.<ref name="bea.gov">[http://bea.gov/bea/regional/gsp/action.cfm?series=NAICS&component=900&state=15&industry=101&year=2005&amp;printable=true&querybutton=Display%20HTML Bureau of Economic Analysis: Gross State Product]</ref> Indiana has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns. Indiana is home to several major sports teams and athletic events including the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Indianapolis Colts]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA's]] [[Indiana Pacers]], the [[Women’s National Basketball Association|WNBA’s]] [[Indiana Fever]], and the [[Indianapolis 500]] and [[Brickyard 400]] [[motorsports]] [[auto racing|races]].

The state has several universities ranked among the best in 2011 rankings of the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''. [[Purdue University|Purdue University - West Lafayette]], [[Indiana University|Indiana University - Bloomington]], and the [[University of Notre Dame]] are ranked among the top 50 in the National Universities Rankings, while [[Butler University|Butler]], [[Valparaiso University|Valparaiso]] and the [[University of Evansville]] are ranked among the top 10 in the Regional University Midwest Rankings. Purdue's engineering programs are ranked tenth in the country. In addition, [[Taylor University|Taylor]] is ranked #1 in the Regional College Midwest Rankings.<ref>[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities National University Ranking|Top National Universities|US News Best Colleges], [[U.S. News & World Report]], retrieved 2011-Jul-26</ref><ref>[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-midwest Regional University Midwest Rankings|Top Regional Universities Midwest|US News Best Colleges], [[U.S. News & World Report]], retrieved 2011-Jul-26</ref><ref>[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-colleges-midwest Regional College Midwest Rankings|Top Regional Colleges Midwest|US News Best Colleges], [[U.S. News & World Report]], retrieved 2013-Feb-01</ref>

== Etymology ==
The state's name means "Land of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]," or simply "Indian Land." This name dates back to at least the 1760s but was first applied to the region by the [[United States Congress]] when the [[Indiana Territory]] was incorporated in 1800, separating it from the [[Northwest Territory]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R.

Residents of Indiana are known as [[Hoosier]]s. The etymology of the word is disputed, but the leading theory as advanced by the Indiana Historical Bureau and the Indiana Historical Society has "Hoosier" originating from the upland South region of the U.S. as a derogatory slang term for a rough countryman, a country bumpkin.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Word Hoosier | author=Graf, Jeffery | publisher=Indiana University – Bloomington | url=http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/internet/extra/hoosier.html | accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Indiana}}
The first inhabitants in what is now Indiana were  the [[Paleo-Indians]], who arrived about 8000&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|BC]] after the melting of the glaciers at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. Divided into small groups, the Paleo-Indians were [[nomad]]s who hunted large [[Game (food)|game]] such as [[mastodons]]. They created stone tools made out of [[chert]] by chipping, [[knapping]] and [[Lithic reduction|flaking]].<ref name="HIS">{{cite web| title =Prehistoric Indians of Indiana| publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://in.gov/dnr/historic/files/prehisindians.pdf| accessdate =2009-07-05 }}</ref> The [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], which began between 5000 and 4000 BC, covered the next phase of indigenous culture. The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. Such new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Arrow#Nocks|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed that settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name="HIS"/> Afterward, the [[Woodland period]] took place in Indiana, where various new cultural attributes appeared. During this period, the people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle portion of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began developing long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name="HIS"/> The [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-1400s for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name="HIS"/> The historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Later they were joined by refugee tribes from eastern regions.
[[File:Natives guiding french explorers through indiana.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Native Americans guide French explorers through Indiana, as depicted by [[Maurice Thompson]] in ''Stories of Indiana''.]]
In 1679 the French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans. By 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.
[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Iroquois]] conquests during the [[Beaver Wars]] (mid-1600s), which largely depopulated the upper and mid-[[Ohio River]] valley.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/neri/parkmgmt/upload/NERI-GARI-final-2-CA-2011.pdf Robrt Maslowski, "Cultural Affiliations Statement: New River Gorge National River and Gauley River National Recreation Area], National Park Service, accessed 2 August 2012</ref>]]
The Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] to the British crown.

The tribes in Indiana did not give up; they destroyed [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Indian use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called Indian Territory. In 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought for more self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31-32.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name="NO">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =2009-07-24 }}</ref> During the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.<ref>Brill, p. 33.</ref> At the end of the war, through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including American Indian lands which they did not own.

In 1787 the US defined present-day Indiana as part of its [[Northwest Territory]]. In 1800, Congress separated [[Ohio]] from the Northwest Territory, designating the rest of the land as the [[Indiana Territory]].<ref name="GAC"/> President [[Thomas Jefferson]] chose [[William Henry Harrison]] as the governor of the territory and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] was established as the capital.<ref>Brill, p. 35.</ref> After [[Michigan]] was separated and the [[Illinois Territory]] was formed, Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography.<ref name="GAC">{{cite web| title =Government at Crossroads: An Indiana chronology|work=[[The Herald Bulletin]]| date =January 5, 2008| url =http://www.theheraldbulletin.com/local/local_story_005185600.html| accessdate =2009-07-22 }}</ref>

In 1810, the [[Shawnee]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813&nbsp;during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and purchase their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36–37.</ref>

In December 1813, [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]] was named the second capital of the Indiana Territory.<ref name="GAC"/> Two years later, a petition for statehood was approved by the territorial general assembly and sent to Congress. An [[Enabling Act]] was passed to provide an election of delegates to write a [[constitution of Indiana|constitution for Indiana]]. On June 10, 1816, delegates assembled at Corydon to write the constitution, which was completed in 19 days. President [[James Madison]] approved Indiana's [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|admission into the union]] as the nineteenth state on December 11, 1816.<ref name="NO"/>

In 1825, the state capital was moved from Corydon to [[Indianapolis]] and 26&nbsp;years later, a second constitution was adopted.<ref name="GAC"/> Following statehood, the new government worked to transform Indiana from a [[American frontier|frontier]] into a developed, well-populated, and thriving state, beginning significant demographic and economic changes. The state's founders initiated a program that led to the construction of roads, [[canal]]s, railroads and state-funded public schools. The plans [[Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act|bankrupted the state]] and were a financial disaster, but increased land and produce value more than fourfold.<ref>{{cite web| last =Vanderstel| first =David G| title =The 1851 Indiana Constitution by David G.

During the [[American Civil War]], Indiana became politically influential and played an important role in the affairs of the nation. As the first western state to mobilize for the United States in the war, Indiana had soldiers participating in all of the major engagements. The state provided 126&nbsp;infantry regiments, 26&nbsp;batteries of artillery and 13&nbsp;regiments of cavalry to the cause of the Union.<ref>Funk, pp. 23–24,163</ref> In 1861, Indiana was assigned a quota of 7,500&nbsp;men to join the Union Army.<ref>Gray (1995), p. 156</ref> So many volunteered in the first call that thousands had to be turned away. Before the war ended, Indiana contributed 208,367&nbsp;men to fight and serve in the war. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416&nbsp;lost their lives in the conflict and over 50,000&nbsp;more were wounded.<ref>Funk, p. 3-4</ref> The only Civil War battle fought in Indiana was the [[Battle of Corydon]], which occurred during [[Morgan's Raid]]. The battle left 15&nbsp;dead, 40&nbsp;wounded, and 355&nbsp;captured.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Civil War; a Narrative, Red River to Appomattox|author=Foote, Shelby|publisher=Random House|year=1974|pages =343–344}}</ref>

Following the American Civil War, Indiana industry began to grow at an accelerated rate across the northern part of the state. With industrialization, workers developed labor unions and suffrage movements arose in relation to the progress of women.<ref>Gray (1995), p. 202.</ref> The [[Indiana Gas Boom]] led to rapid industrialization during the late 19th&nbsp;century by providing cheap fuel to the region.<ref>Gray (1995), p. 13.</ref> In the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong [[Rust Belt|manufacturing state]] with ties to the new auto industry.<ref name="The History of Indiana"/> [[Haynes-Apperson]], the nation's first commercially successful auto company, operated in [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]] until 1925. The construction of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and the start of auto-related industries were also related to the auto industry boom.<ref>Brill, p. 47.</ref>

During the 1930s, Indiana, like the rest of the nation, was affected by the [[Great Depression]]. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana, such as the decline of urbanization. The [[Dust Bowl]] further to the west resulted in many migrants fleeing into the more industrialized Midwest. Governor [[Paul V. McNutt]]'s administration struggled to build a state-funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and taxes were both cut drastically in response to the Depression, and the state government was completely reorganized. McNutt ended [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in the state and enacted the state's first income tax. On several occasions, he declared martial law to put an end to worker strikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countyhistory.com/doc.gov/037.htm|title= Paul V.

With the conclusion of World War II, Indiana rebounded to levels of production prior to the Great Depression. Industry became the primary employer, a trend that continued into the 1960s. Urbanization during the 1950s and 1960s led to substantial growth in the state's cities. The auto, steel and pharmaceutical industries topped Indiana's major businesses. Indiana's population continued to grow during the years after the war, exceeding five million by the 1970&nbsp;census.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Geography|author=Haynes, Kingsley E. & Machunda, Zachary B|year=1987|pages =319–333}}</ref> In the 1960s, the administration of [[Matthew E.

Beginning in 1970, a series of amendments to the state constitution were proposed. With adoption, the [[Indiana Court of Appeals]] was created and the procedure of appointing justices on the courts was adjusted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/history.html|title=History and Origins|author=Indiana Historical Bureau| publisher=Indiana Historical Bureau|accessdate=2009-07-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>

The [[1973 oil crisis]] created a recession that hurt the automotive industry in Indiana. Companies such as [[Delco Electronics]] and [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]] began a long series of downsizing that contributed to high unemployment rates in manufacturing in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]], and [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]]. The restructuring and deindustrialization trend continued until the 1980s, when the national and state economy began to diversify and recover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1992/02/art2exc.htm|title=Auto industry jobs in the 1980s: a decade of transition|last=Singleton|first=Christopher J.|publisher=Unites State Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref>

The state includes two natural regions of the United States, the Central Lowlands and the [[Interior Low Plateaus]].<ref>Logan, Cumings, Malott, Visher, Tucker & Reeves, p. 70</ref> The [[till plain]]s make up the northern and central allotment of Indiana. Much of its appearance is a result of elements left behind by glaciers. Central Indiana is mainly flat with some low rolling hills (except where rivers cut deep valleys through the plain, like at the Wabash River and Sugar Creek) and soil composed of glacial sands, gravel and clay, which results in exceptional farmland.<ref name="FW"/> Northern Indiana is also very similar except for the presence of higher and hillier [[terminal moraine]]s and many [[kettle lake]]s in some regions. In [[northwest Indiana]], there are various sand ridges and dunes, some reaching near 200 feet in height. These are located along the Lake Michigan shoreline and also inland to the [[Kankakee Outwash Plain|Kankakee River Valley]]. The unglaciated southern segment of the state carries a different and off-balance surface, characterized in places by profound valleys and rugged, hilly terrain much different from the rest of the state.Here, bedrock is exposed at the surface and isn't buried in glacial till like further north. There are numerous caves in the area. The soil is fertile in the valleys of southern Indiana.

Major river systems in Indiana include the Whitewater, White, Blue, Wabash, St. Joseph, and Maumee rivers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Indiana Geology| last=Logan |first= William N. |coauthor=Edgar Roscoe Cumings, Clyde Arnett Malott, Stephen Sargent Visher, et al. | year=1922|publisher=Indiana Department of Concervation/|page=257}}</ref> According to the Indiana Department of National Resources, in 2007 there were 65 rivers, streams, and creeks of environmental interest or scenic beauty, which included only a portion of an estimated 24,000 total river miles within the state.<ref>{{cite web| title = Information Bulletin #4 (Second Amendment), Outstanding Rivers List for Indiana | publisher = Natural Resources Commission | date =2007-05-30 | url = http://www.in.gov/legislative/register/20070530-IR-312070287NRA.xml.pdf | accessdate =2012-08-15}}</ref> The [[Wabash River]], which is the longest free-flowing river east of the [[Mississippi River]], is the official river of Indiana.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian M |last=Boyce |title=Terre Haute's Top 40: From a trickle in Ohio to the Valley’s signature waterway, the Wabash River is forever a part of Terre Haute |work=Tribune-Star | date=August 29, 2009 | accessdate=2009-09-24|url=http://www.tribstar.com/local/local_story_241223116.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last =Jerse| first =Dorothy| title =Looking Back: Gov.

While droughts occasionally occur in the state, rainfall totals are distributed relatively equally throughout the year. Precipitation totals range from {{convert|35|in|cm}} near Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana to {{convert|45|in|cm}} along the Ohio River in the south, while the state's average is {{convert|40|in|cm}}. Annual snowfall in Indiana varies widely across the state, ranging from {{convert|80|in|cm}} in the northwest along Lake Michigan to {{convert|14|in|cm}} in the far south. [[Lake effect snow]] accounts for roughly half of the snowfall in northwest and north central Indiana due to the effects of the moisture and relative warmth of Lake Michigan upwind.

===Time zones===
[[File:National-atlas-timezones-2006.gif|thumb|350px|Map of U.S. time zones with new (2006) CST and EST areas displayed, showing Indiana largely in the Eastern zone]]
{{Main|Time in Indiana}}
Indiana is one of thirteen U.S. states that is divided into more than one time zone. Indiana's [[time zone]]s have fluctuated over the past century. At present most of the state observes [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]; six counties near Chicago and six near Evansville observe [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central Time]]. Debate continues on the matter.

Before 2006, most of Indiana did not observe [[daylight saving time]] (DST). Some counties within this area, particularly [[Floyd County, Indiana|Floyd]], [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark]], and [[Harrison County, Indiana|Harrison]] counties near [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[Ohio County, Indiana|Ohio]] and [[Dearborn County, Indiana|Dearborn]] counties near [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, unofficially observed DST by local custom. Since April 2006 the entire state observes DST.

==Indiana counties and statistical areas==
Indiana is divided into 92 [[List of counties in Indiana|counties]]. As of 2010, the state includes 16 metropolitan and 25 micropolitan statistical areas, 117 incorporated cities, 450 towns, and several other smaller divisions and statistical areas.<ref name=GeoCensus/><ref>A 2008 news report indicated there were 13&nbsp;metropolitan areas in Indiana.

The remaining two counties, Dearborn and Ohio, are combined into one circuit. Many counties operate [[superior court]]s in addition to the circuit court. In densely populated counties where the caseload is traditionally greater, separate courts have been established to solely hear either juvenile, criminal, probate or small claims cases. The establishment, frequency and jurisdiction of these additional courts varies greatly from county to county. There are 85 city and town courts in Indiana municipalities, created by local ordinance, typically handling minor offenses and not considered [[courts of record]]. County officials that are elected to four-year terms include an auditor, recorder, treasurer, sheriff, coroner and clerk of the circuit court.

[[File:2002 IN Proof.png|thumb|150px|An Indiana [[50 State Quarters|State Quarter]].]]

In 2000, Indiana had a work force of 3,084,100.<ref>{{cite web| title =Economic Base| publisher=City of Valparaiso| url =http://www.ci.valparaiso.in.us/planning/ComprehensivePlan/CompPlan/ChapterI.pdf| accessdate =2009-11-02 }}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> The total gross state product in 2010 was $275.7&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=GDP by State|url=http://greyhill.com/gdp-by-state|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> A high percentage of Indiana's income is from manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Economy at a Glance | publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | url=http://stats.bls.gov/eag/eag.in.htm | accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> The Calumet region of [[northwest Indiana]] is the largest steel producing area in the U.S. Indiana's other manufactures include pharmaceuticals and medical devices, automobiles, electrical equipment, transportation equipment, chemical products, rubber, petroleum and coal products, and factory machinery.

Despite its reliance on manufacturing, Indiana has been much less affected by declines in traditional [[Rust Belt]] manufactures than many of its neighbors. The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is located primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Manufacturers in Indiana | publisher=Purdue University Center for Rural Development | date=July 19, 1998}}</ref>

Indiana is home to the international headquarters and research facilities of pharmaceutical company [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in Indianapolis, the state's largest corporation, as well as the world headquarters of Mead Johnson Nutritionals in Evansville.<ref>[http://wndu.com/news/112005/news_46007.php WNDU-TV: News Story: Bayer is leaving Elkhart – November 16, 2005]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> Overall, Indiana ranks fifth among all U.S. states in total sales and shipments of pharmaceutical products and second highest in the number of biopharmaceutical related jobs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Economy & Demographics | publisher=Terre Haute Economic Development Co. | url=http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref>

Indiana is located within the U.S. [[Corn Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]]. The state has a feedlot-style system raising corn to fatten hogs and cattle. Along with corn, [[soybeans]] are also a major cash crop. Its proximity to large urban centers, such as [[Indianapolis]] and Chicago, assure that dairying, egg production, and specialty horticulture occur.
Other crops include melons, tomatoes, grapes, mint, popping corn, and tobacco in the southern counties.<ref>{{cite web | title=USDA Crop Profiles | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | url=http://cipm.ncsu.edu/cropprofiles/cplist.cfm?org=state | accessdate=2006-11-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070223130933/http://cipm.ncsu.edu/cropprofiles/cplist.cfm?org=state <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 23, 2007}}</ref> Most of the original land was not prairie and had to be cleared of deciduous trees. Many parcels of woodland remain and support a furniture-making sector in the southern portion of the state.

In 2011 Indiana was ranked first in the Midwest and sixth in the country for best places to do business according to CEO magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiefexecutive.net/best-worst-states-for-business |title=Best/Worst States for Business &#124; ChiefExecutive.net &#124; Chief Executive Magazine |publisher=ChiefExecutive.net |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>

===State budget===
{{See also|Taxes in Indiana}}

Indiana does not have a legal requirement to balance the state budget either in law or its constitution. Instead, Indiana has a constitutional ban on assuming debt.
Indiana has a [[Rainy Day Fund]] and for healthy reserves proportional to spending.
Indiana is one of the few states in the U.S. which do not allow a line-item veto.

Indiana has a flat state [[income tax]] rate of 3.4%. Many Indiana counties also collect income tax. The state [[sales tax]] rate is 7% with exemptions for food, prescription medications and over-the-counter medications.<ref>{{cite web|title=State Sales Tax Rates|url=http://www.money-zine.com/Financial-Planning/Tax-Shelter/State-Sales-Tax-Rates/|publisher=Money-Zine.com|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> In some jurisdictions an additional Food and Beverage Tax is charged, at a rate of 1% (Marion County’s rate is 2%), on sales of prepared meals and beverages.<ref>{{cite web|title=INDIANA Retail Sales Tax & Use Tax|url=http://www.in.gov/dor/files/brochure3.pdf|work=Indiana Department of Revenue|publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>

[[Property tax]]es are imposed on both real and personal property in Indiana and are administered by the Department of Local Government Finance. Property is subject to taxation by a variety of taxing units (schools, counties, townships, cities and towns, libraries), making the total tax rate the sum of the tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which a property is located. However, a "circuit breaker" law enacted on March 19, 2008 limits [[property tax]]es to one percent of assessed value for homeowners, two percent for rental properties and farmland and three percent for businesses.

In Fiscal year 2011 Indiana reported one of the largest surpluses among U.S states, with an extra $1.2&nbsp;billion in its accounts. Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, authorized bonus payments of up to $1,000 for state employees on Friday, July 15, 2011. An employee who “meets expectations” will get $500, those who “exceed expectations” will receive $750 and “outstanding workers” will see an extra $1,000 in their August paychecks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/17/many-states-celebrate-surpluses-as-congress-strugg/ |title=Many states celebrate surpluses as Congress struggles with debt |work=Washington Times |date=July 17, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>

===Energy===
{{Further|List of Generating Stations in Indiana}}
Indiana's power production chiefly consists of the consumption of fossil fuels, mainly coal. Indiana has 24 coal power plants, including the largest coal power plant in the United States, [[Gibson Generating Station]], located across the Wabash River from [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]]. Indiana is also home to the coal-fired plant with the highest sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States, the [[R. Gallagher Generating Station|Gallagher]] power plant just west of New Albany.<ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2007/2007-07-26-05.asp Ens-newswire.com]</ref>

The state has an estimated coal reserves of fifty-seven billion tons; state mining operations produces thirty-five million tons of coal annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://igs.indiana.edu/coal/index.cfm|title=Coal in Indiana|author=Indiana Geological Survey|publisher=[[Purdue University]]|accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref> While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, however, progress has been very slow, mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in Southern Indiana. Most of the new plants in the state have been [[coal gasification]] plants. Another source is hydroelectric power.

[[Wind power in Indiana|Wind power]] is now being developed. New estimates in 2006 raised the wind capacity for Indiana from 30 MW at 50 m turbine height to 40,000 MW at 70 m, and to 130,000 MW at 100 m, in 2010, the height of newer turbines.<ref>[http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html Indiana's Renewable Energy Resources] Retrieved August 20, 2008</ref> As of the end of 2011, Indiana has installed 1,340 MW of wind turbines.<ref>[http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp U.S. Installed Wind Capacity]</ref>

==Transportation==

===Airports===
{{See also|List of airports in Indiana}}
[[Indianapolis International Airport]] serves the greater Indianapolis area and has finished constructing a new passenger terminal. The new airport opened in November 2008 and offers a new midfield passenger terminal, concourses, air traffic control tower, parking garage, and airfield and apron improvements.<ref>{{cite web | title=New Indianapolis Airport | publisher=Indianapolis Airport Authority | url=http://www.newindianapolisairport.com | accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref>

Other major airports include [[Evansville Regional Airport]], [[Fort Wayne International Airport]] (which houses the [[122d Fighter Wing]] of the [[Air National Guard]]), and [[South Bend Regional Airport]]. A long-standing proposal to turn [[Gary Chicago International Airport]] into Chicago's third major airport received a boost in early 2006 with the approval of $48&nbsp;million in federal funding over the next ten years.<ref>{{cite web | title=Gary Airpport Gets Millions in Federal Funding | publisher=CBS Channel 2 | url=http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_016180843.html | accessdate=2006-10-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The [[Terre Haute International Airport]] has no airlines operating out of the facility but is used for private flying. Since 1954, the [[181st Fighter Wing]] of the Indiana [[Air National Guard]] has been stationed at the airport. However, the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) Proposal of 2005 stated that the 181st would lose its fighter mission and [[F-16]] aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility as a general-aviation only facility.

The southern part of the state is also served by the [[Louisville International Airport]] across the Ohio River in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].
The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Florence, Kentucky]].
Most residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use the two Chicago airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].

===Highways===
{{See also|List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|List of State Roads in Indiana}}
[[File:2008 Indiana Plate Selection.JPG|thumb|2008–2013 [[Vehicle registration plates of Indiana|Indiana license plate]]. This plate comes in the four variants shown above. The variant immediately above is the grandfathered version. In all four cases, the county, in this case [[Gibson County, Indiana|Gibson]], is displayed on a white tag at the top of the plate.|150px|right]]

The major U.S. Interstate highways in Indiana are [[I-64]], [[I-164]], [[I-65]], [[I-265]], [[I-465]], [[I-865]], [[I-69]], [[I-469]], [[I-70]], [[I-74]], [[I-80]], [[I-90]], [[I-94]] and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio-Indiana-Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, Interstate 64 and State Road 64 both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.

===County roads===
Most Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the [[9-1-1]] system. Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (e.g., Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).

There are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.

Notably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e. Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.

===Rail===
Indiana has over 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other [[Class I railroad]]s in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching & terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is currently implementing an extensive rail plan that was prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm}}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] in Indianapolis, have been created from abandoned rails routes.

===Ports===
Indiana annually ships over 70 million tons of cargo by water each year, which ranks 14th among all U.S. states. More than half of Indiana's border is water, which includes {{convert|400|mi|km|-1}} of direct access to two major freight transportation arteries: the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Seaway (via Lake Michigan) and the Inland Waterway System (via the Ohio River). The [[Port of Indiana|Ports of Indiana]] manages three major ports which include [[Burns Harbor, Indiana|Burns Harbor]], [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], and [[Mount Vernon, Indiana|Mount Vernon]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Ports of Indiana Website | url=http://www.portsofindiana.com | accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>

In [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] three public and several private port facilities receive year-round service from five major barge lines operating on the [[Ohio River]]. Evansville has been a [[United States Customs|U.S. Customs Port of Entry]] for more than 125 years. Because of this, it is possible to have international cargo shipped to Evansville in bond. The international cargo can then clear Customs in Evansville rather than a coastal port.

==Education==
Indiana's 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state-funded [[public school (government funded)|public school]] system. It also allotted one township for a public university.<ref>{{cite web
| title= Indiana History Part 3
| publisher=Northern Indiana Center for History
| url= http://www.centerforhistory.org/indiana_history_main3.html
| accessdate= 2009-08-26 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> However, the plan turned out to be far too idealistic for a pioneer society, as tax money was not accessible for its organization. In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution.

Although the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.

The largest educational institution is [[Indiana University]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington|flagship campus]] of which was endorsed as Indiana Seminary in 1820. [[Indiana State University]] was established as the state's [[Normal School]] in 1865; [[Purdue University]] was chartered as a [[Land-grant university|land-grant college]] in 1869. The three other independent state universities are [[Vincennes University]] (1802), [[Ball State University]] (1918) and [[University of Southern Indiana]] (1965).

Many of the private colleges and universities in Indiana are affiliated with religious groups. The [[University of Notre Dame]] and the [[University of Saint Francis (Indiana)|University of Saint Francis]] are popular [[Roman Catholic school]]s. Universities affiliated with Protestant denominations include [[Anderson University (Indiana)|Anderson University]], [[Butler University]], [[Indiana Wesleyan University]], [[Taylor University]], [[Franklin College (Indiana)|Franklin College]], [[DePauw University]], [[Earlham College]], [[Valparaiso University]], [[University of Indianapolis]],<ref name="ST"/> and [[University of Evansville]].<ref>{{cite web

Indiana also is home to Wabash College, one of the three remaining four-year all-male colleges.{{citation needed|to all male|date=May 2013}}

[[Ivy Tech Community College]] is the nation's largest state-wide community college with single accreditation. It is the state's largest public post-secondary institution serving nearly 200,000 students a year.

==Sports==

===Professional sports===
Indiana has an extensive history with [[auto racing]]. Indianapolis hosts the [[Indianapolis 500]] mile race over [[Memorial Day]] weekend at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] every May. The name of the race is usually shortened to "Indy 500" and also goes by the nickname "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing." The race attracts over 250,000 people every year making it the largest single day sporting event in the world. The track also hosts the [[Allstate 400 at the Brickyard]] ([[NASCAR]]) and the [[Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix]] ([[MotoGP]]). From 2000 to 2007, it hosted the [[United States Grand Prix]] ([[Formula One]]). Indiana features the world's largest and most prestigious drag race, the [[NHRA U.S. Nationals|NHRA Mac Tools U.S. Nationals]], held each Labor Day weekend at [[Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis]] in [[Clermont, Indiana]]. Indiana is also host to two major [[hydroplane racing|unlimited hydroplane racing]] power boat race circuits in the major [[H1 Unlimited]] league: [[Thunder on the Ohio]] ([[Evansville, Indiana]]) and the [[Madison Regatta]] ([[Madison, Indiana]]).

{{asof|2013}} Indiana has produced more [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) players per capita than any other state. Muncie has produced the most per capita of any American city, with two other Indiana cities in the top ten.<ref name="deadspin20130617">{{cite web | url=http://deadspin.com/infographics-where-do-pro-basketball-players-come-from-513261549 | title=Infographics: Where Do Pro Basketball Players Come From? | work=Deadspin | date=2013-06-17 | accessdate=2013-06-18 | author=Fischer-Baum, Reuben}}</ref> It has a rich basketball heritage that reaches back to the formative years of the sport itself. The [[Indiana Pacers]] of the NBA play their home games at [[Bankers Life Fieldhouse]]; they began play in 1967 in the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) and joined the NBA when the leagues [[ABA-NBA merger|merged]] in 1976. Although [[James Naismith]] developed basketball in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1891, Indiana is where high school basketball was born. In 1925, Naismith visited an Indiana basketball state finals game along with 15,000 screaming fans and later wrote "Basketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the center of the sport." The 1986 film ''[[Hoosiers]]'' is inspired by the story of the 1954 Indiana state champions [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|Milan High School]].

Indianapolis is home to the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. The Colts are members of the [[AFC South|South Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]]. The Colts have roots back to 1913 as the [[Dayton Triangles]]. They became an official team after moving to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland|MD]], in 1953. In 1984, the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Colts]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation controversy|relocated]] to Indianapolis, leading to an eventual rivalry with the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. After calling the [[RCA Dome]] home for 25 years, the Colts currently play their home games at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in Indianapolis. While in Baltimore, the Colts won the [[Super Bowl V|1970 Super Bowl]]. In Indianapolis, the Colts won [[Super Bowl XLI]], bringing the franchise total to two. In recent years the Colts have regularly competed in the NFL playoffs.
