The Houses provide a very competitive spirit between girls and are the basis for many inter-house competitions throughout the year, including Junior Drama (also known as the Performing Arts Festival), Sports Day and the Music Festival.

==School Calendar Events==
* Junior Drama (Performing Arts festival)- a Christmas festival where sixth formers direct a music act, a drama piece, a dance drama and a 'mystery.'
* Public speaking - a competition where one girl from each form talks on a subject. A guest judge is invited and the winner from each year group receives a colour badge.
* Children in need - the biggest charity event on the school calendar, this is a non-uniform day with a spectacular show at lunchtime.
* International week- this gives the girls a chance to learn different languages, take part in activities and eat food from different countries. On the last day girls are invited to dress up as someone from a different country. 
* House Challenge - similar to University Challenge.
* Sports Day
* Music Festival - a summer festival with many music classes for the different houses.
(Along with all these there are regular celebration days such as fairtrade day, community day and many of celebritys come into talk aswell.)
