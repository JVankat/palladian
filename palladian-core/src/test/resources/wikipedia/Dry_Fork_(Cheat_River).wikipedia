The '''Dry Fork''' is a {{convert|39.1|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}}<ref name=NHD>{{cite web| url=http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/| title=The National Map| publisher=U.S. Geological Survey| accessdate=Feb. 17, 2011}}</ref> [[tributary]] of the [[Black Fork (Cheat River)|Black Fork]] of the [[Cheat River]] in the [[Allegheny Mountains]] of eastern [[West Virginia]] in the [[United States]].  Via the Black Fork, the Cheat, and the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers, it is part of the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the [[Mississippi River]].  The Dry Fork flows for much of its length in the [[Monongahela National Forest]] and drains mostly [[rural]] and [[forest]]ed areas.<ref name=DeLorme>[[DeLorme]] (1997). ''West Virginia Atlas & Gazetteer''.  Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme.  ISBN 0-89933-246-3.</ref>  According to the [[Geographic Names Information System]], it has also been known historically as '''Dry Run'''.<ref>{{Gnis|1550963|Dry Fork}}</ref>  The stream's name derives from the occurrence of underground passages through which portions of the stream flow, leaving a dry streambed on the surface at times during the year.<ref>{{cite book| author=Kenny, Hamill |title= West Virginia Place Names: Their Origin and Meaning, Including the Nomenclature of the Streams and Mountains |year=1945 |publisher=The Place Name Press |location=Piedmont, West Virginia |page= 215}}</ref> (See [[Sinks of Gandy]])

The Dry Fork rises between [[Rich Mountain (West Virginia)|Rich Mountain]] and [[Little Middle Mountain]] in eastern [[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]] and initially flows north-northeastwardly, past the town of [[Harman, West Virginia|Harman]]; in [[Tucker County, West Virginia|Tucker County]] it turns to the northwest and flows to the town of [[Hendricks, West Virginia|Hendricks]], where it meets the [[Blackwater River (West Virginia)|Blackwater River]] to form the Black Fork.<ref name=DeLorme/>

==Tributaries==
Gandy Creek (which passes through a well-known cave, the "[[Sinks of Gandy]]") joins Dry Fork at the town of Gandy. In the lower part of its course the Dry Fork collects the [[Laurel Fork (Cheat River)|Laurel Fork]], which joins it in Randolph County, and the [[Glady Fork]], which joins it in Tucker County.<ref name=DeLorme/>  Both of these are also considered principal tributaries of the Cheat River.<ref>Julian, Norman.  2006.  "Cheat River."  ''The West Virginia Encyclopedia''.  Ken Sullivan, editor.  Charleston, WV: West Virginia Humanities Council.  ISBN 0-9778498-0-5.</ref>  Red Creek also drains much of the [[Dolly Sods Wilderness]] area.
