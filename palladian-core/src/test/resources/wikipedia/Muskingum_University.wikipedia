'''Muskingum University''' is a private four-year comprehensive college located in [[New Concord, Ohio|New Concord]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. It is located approximately sixty miles east of the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. 

The university was founded in 1837.

Muskingum University is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], although since the 1960s the school's religious nature has diminished. 

Collectively, the university's alumni are referred to as the ''"Long Magenta Line"'' and students (both past and present) are known simply as ''"Muskies"''. [[New Concord, Ohio]] is located in far eastern [[Muskingum County, Ohio|Muskingum County]], which derives its name from the [[Muskingum River]]. Hence the often misspelled and mispronounced Delaware Indian word ''Muskingum'' (translation- ''"village on the river bank"'' and/or ''"glare of an elk's eye"''- there's a dispute) was used in naming the school. In June 2009, the institution's name was changed from "Muskingum College" to "Muskingum University". 

The university's colors are [[black]] and [[magenta]] and the school's mascot is the “Fighting Muskie” (the [[muskellunge]], the largest member of the pike family). 

The university's motto is ''"Omni, Trinum, Perfectum"'', Latin for ''"Everything which comes in threes is perfect"'', which is a reference to both the [[Christian]] [[Trinity]] and Muskingum's mission to develop their students' minds, bodies and souls.

Muskingum offers more than 40 academic majors. The newest programs launched are digital media design, criminal justice, and engineering. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) program has also been initiated. 

Graduate programs are offered in education and management information systems, strategy and technology. Muskingum is nationally known{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} for its innovative PLUS program, a service which assists students with learning disabilities cope, adjust, and ultimately succeed in a higher learning environment.

Muskingum's campus consists of 21 major buildings, a football stadium and a small lake, which all sit atop {{convert|225|acre|km2}} of rolling hills overlooking New Concord. The beauty of the campus was recently captured in ''"A Song of the Seasons: Paintings by Jianmin Dou"'' by Donna Edsall and Yan Sun (2003).

==History==
In 1827, the [[National Road]] (now [[U.S. 40]]) was laid through what is now New Concord, roughly following what had been the primitive roadway known as [[Zane's Trace]]. A year later, the village of [[New Concord, Ohio]] was established by Scotch-Irish [[Presbyterians]]. On July 9, 1836, the first recorded meeting of the ''"Friends of Education"'' in New Concord, led by New Concord residents Samuel Willson and Benjamin Waddle, was held. A year later, the [[Ohio General Assembly]] authorized the creation of a college in [[New Concord, OH]] after being petitioned by the ''"Friends of Education"'' committee. On April 24, 1837, Muskingum College opened. Muskingum became a coeducational institution in 1854. In 1958, the [[United Presbyterian Church of North America]] (UPCNA) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] (PCUSA) merge by signing a historic agreement in Brown Chapel. In 2001, the school's women's [[softball]] team captured the [[NCAA]] Division III National Championship, the school's first national title.<ref>William L. Fisk, "The Early Years Of Muskingum College," ''Old Northwest'' 1979 5(1): 19-44</ref>

==Academics==
Muskingum has been continuously accredited by the North Central Association of College and Secondary Schools since 1919. ''"The school up on the hills"'', as it is sometimes called by locals, offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees at the undergraduate level, and at the graduate level [http://www.muskingum.edu/~misst Master of Information Strategy Systems and Technology],  [[Master of Arts in Education]], and [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] graduate degrees. The school offers 44 [[academic major]]s along with a large number of [[Minor (law)|minors]], 9 pre-professional programs (including [[pre-law]] and pre-medicine) and teaching licensure, all of which must be pursued within a strong [[liberal arts]] curriculum, known at Muskingum as the ''"Liberal Arts Essentials"'' (LAEs) (see below). Among Muskingum's strongest undergraduate academic programs are its science division, math program, education department, and journalism program. Muskingum is often proclaimed as a "best value" in education, by combining strong academics with low tuition, by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' and similar publications. In their 2008 ''America's Best College's'' guide, ''U.S. News & World Report'' ranked Muskingum the "31st Best Master's Level University" in the Midwest academically.[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1univmas_mw_brief.php] and the "4th Best Value" among Midwest Master's Level Universities [http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/bvunivmas_mw_brief.php].

During the period between 1925- 1970 Muskingum was known as a football powerhouse in the OAC, led by college football Hall of Famer [[Edgar Sherman]], first as a player and then as head coach. The Muskies even represented the OAC in two Grantland Rice Bowls (1964 & 1966) and won 12 OAC football championships during that forty-five year period. Through the years the M.C. men's basketball team has also seen success, having won 3 regular season OAC championships and 7 OAC tournament championships. In more recent years, the Muskingum women's softball teams have achieved considerable success, winning every OAC regular season championship since 1998 and the NCAA Division III national championship in 2001.  Muskingum's softball coach Donna Newberry holds the record for the most victories in NCAA Division III history.

Collectively, Muskingum's alumni are referred to as the ''"Long Magenta Line"''.  Muskingum College's favorite son is former [[astronaut]] and U.S. senator [[John Glenn]], who graduated with a [[bachelor of science]] in 1962, the same year he became the first American to orbit the Earth (Glenn also has an honorary degree from Muskingum from 1961, but the B.S. he earned in 1962 is an earned degree). In 1983, John Glenn launched his [[White House]] bid from the Muskingum College quad in the heart of the campus. Glenn also announced his retirement from the [[United States Senate]] in Brown Chapel on live national television in 1997. Upon his retirement, Glenn donated his archives to the [[Ohio State University]], with special conditions that Muskingum students would benefit from the collection at any time.  Muskingum received national media attention once again in 1998, when a 77 year old Glenn returned to space aboard the [[Space Shuttle Discovery]], becoming the oldest person ever in space.
