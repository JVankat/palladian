The '''Tees Transporter Bridge''', often referred to as the '''Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge''', is the furthest downstream bridge across the [[River Tees]], England. It connects [[Middlesbrough]], on the south bank, to [[Port Clarence]], on the north bank.  It is a [[transporter bridge]], carrying a travelling 'car', or 'gondola', suspended from the bridge, across the river in 90 seconds. The gondola can carry 200 people, 9 cars, or 6 cars and one minibus. It carries the [[A178 road|A178]] Middlesbrough to Hartlepool road. Locally the bridge is often referred to simply as 'the Transporter'.

==History==
The idea of a transporter bridge across the River Tees was first mooted in 1872 when Charles Smith, Manager of the Hartlepool Iron Works, submitted a scheme to Middlesbrough Corporation.  However the scheme was not pursued and it would not be until the new century that the idea of a transporter bridge across the river would again be revisited. Following a 1907 [[Act of Parliament]] the Bridge was built at a cost of [[Pound sterling|£]]68,026 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 8[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|68026|1907|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} values),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} by [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]] of Glasgow between 1910 and 1911 to replace the 'Hugh Bell' and 'Erimus' steam ferry services.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howes |first= Brian |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |month= May |title=Building the Past – Middlesbrough Transport Bridge|journal=Best of British |volume= |issue= |pages=73 |issn=1355-6681}}</ref> A transporter bridge was chosen because Parliament ruled that the new scheme of crossing the river had to avoid affecting the river navigation. The foundation stones, made of Aberdeen granite, were laid by Mayor of Middlesbrough Thomas Gibson-Poole and Alderman Joseph McLauchlan, the initiator of the transporter bridge scheme.

The opening ceremony on 17 October 1911 was performed by [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]].
During [[World War II]] the superstructure of the bridge was hit by a bomb. In 1953, the gondola got stuck half-way. While it was stuck, [[gale]] force winds lashed water to within inches of it. However, despite this the gondola and The Transporter Bridge are still running in perfect order.

In 1974, the comedy actor [[Terry Scott]], travelling between his hotel in Middlesbrough and a performance at the [[Billingham]] Forum, mistook the bridge for a regular toll crossing and drove his car off the end of the roadway, landing in the safety netting beneath.<ref>{{cite web

In December 1993, the bridge was awarded the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]' highest honour, The Heritage Plaque, for engineering excellence, in recognition of the Council's efforts in keeping the bridge in good working order. Its historical importance was also recognised in 1985 by its listing as a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] and its prominence as a local landmark was further enhanced in 1993 by the installation of flood lights that operate during the winter months.

It has featured in films and TV programmes including ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[The Fast Show]]'', ''[[Spender]]'' and ''[[Steel River Blues]]''. In the [[millennium]] celebrations of 2000, [[firework]]s were fired from its length. The storyline of the third series of ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'', saw the bridge dismantled to be sold to and re-erected in the USA. The local council received calls from people worried that the bridge was really being pulled down,<ref>{{cite web

==Facts and figures==
The Tees Transporter Bridge has an overall length (including cantilevers) of {{convert|851|ft|m}}, leaving a span between the centres of the towers of {{convert|580|ft|m}}, the beam of the bridge being carried at a height of {{convert|160|ft|m}} above the road. This combined with an overall height of {{convert|225|ft|m}}, makes this bridge the second largest example remaining in the world; the largest being the bridge across the [[Newport Transporter Bridge|River Usk]], at Newport in south Wales.

Note: The Newport Transporter is considered the largest transporter bridge in limited terms only. When compared with Middlesbrough's Transporter Bridge the Newport Transporter is: {{convert|16|ft|m}} taller; but {{convert|200|ft|m}} less in total deck span (discounting the anchor cables which, as with a ship, is technically part of the object but does not contribute to its overall length); and utilises approx. 1400 tons of steel compared to 2600 tons for Middlesbrough's Transporter (this weight of steel takes no account of concrete foundations or concrete anchors).

The Tees Transporter Bridge has a safety announcement, and until recently, it was a southern voice. Middlesbrough Council decided it was time to change the voice, and held a competition for the new voice. The competition was won by a Middlesbrough man, Brian Hall, who was one of the last few finalists in the competition for the [[Speaking_clock#United_Kingdom|speaking clock]] in 2006. In 2008 Brian and his son, Sam, took part in a fundraising zipwire event off the Transporter Bridge, raising over £500 in doing so.

The bridge is currently owned by Middlesbrough Council and Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. Middlesbrough Council has control of the day-to-day operations and maintenance.

==Vintage bus running day==
[[Image:Daimler Fleetline JDC544L at the Transporter Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Daimler Fleetline JDC544L at the Transporter Bridge]]The bridge is also host to an annual vintage bus running day, organised by The 500 Group.<ref>[http://www.500group.org.uk/ The 500 Group]</ref> On this one day per year, usually a Sunday in April, vintage buses take people on free rides around [[Teesside]].  As part of the 2006 and 2007 events the bridge made a special trip carrying a former Teesside Municipal Transport [[Daimler Fleetline]]. Prior to this a double deck bus had not used the bridge in 30 years.<ref>[http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/the500group/page3.phtml Our annual Teesside Running Day], 27 April 2007 (accessed 19 January 2008)</ref>
