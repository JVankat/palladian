We're currently in the Blueprint phase for our CRM implementation.<br />
<br />
We're deciding how to handle Leads: in our business, we don't always know at the time of lead creation if the lead will be worked by a channel partner (distributor) or by an internal employee.<br />
<br />
Because of this, we're leaning toward creating all leads as the <b>Lead Channel Partner</b> transaction.<br />
<br />
If the lead is worked by an internal employee, we'd never fill in the <b>Employee Resp. at Ch. Partner</b> field.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on potential downsides to this approach?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
