I've been to the past four A's opening nights.  Some might say that's like being a Christmas and Easter Catholic, but I actually do worship at the Coliseum alter more than twice a year.  

Last night, there isn't much left to be said that hasn't been already said here.  That's not going to stop me from saying more.  Heck, that's why I HAVE a blog.

Zito had his worst night as a major leaguer.  He fruitlessly nibbled more than dentureless Grandma on an ear of corn.  At the beginning of the game, it was peek through your fingers while watching a scary car-wreck night and by the end it had turned into a Scary Movie-type parody.  Laughable.  Zito thought it was "Drive It Outta the Park" Monday, allowing the fearsome Yankees lineup to repeatedly walk 90 feet then drive that baby home.  The Yankees lineup can be absolutely devastating because of their patient approach.  Billy's always called power the great equalizer and the Yankees ooze with power and patience.  Walk, walk, bomb.  I thought I read that was a recipe for a winning offense somewhere?  Where could that have been?  Anyone remember?

The A's stellar infield defense?  Perhaps Mike Thalbum also forgot that in Arizona?  Crosby gets a pass on his error because it appeared like the problem getting the ball was a direct result of having Robinson Cano's shoe still stuck to his hand.  I'm starting to think Crosby should just plan his Well-baby annual doctor visit on opening night for the A's.  Hey, if he's gonna wind up there any way, why not just consolidate?

On the positive side of things, the A's almost scored a hat trick of magical outfield catches.  First, Milton Bradley made a spectacular catch, then Kotsay one-upped The Gamer with a sliding catch that was almost as gorgeous as his wife and finally, Jay Payton rocketed one off the crossbar with his attempt to nail the trifecta.  It's this reason why people were raving about the A's outfield defense.  Now if only the infield follows suit today.  Speaking of suits, Frank Thomas proved that Hurt beats Unit in any game of 6'7" Hall-of-Famer stud.  Thomas loudly pronounced his game-changing presence and then got buzzed for his efforts.  I don't know, if I'm tall and somewhat lanky Randy Johnson, do I want to be angering the guy who outweighs me by probably 60 pounds and is probably looking for someplace to channel the Kenny Williams rage?  I'm thinking, um, no.

Two observations from being at the game, the stadium didn't nearly contain as many Yankee fans as it normally does.  I've been to quite a few A's/Yankee games at the Coliseum and normally half of whatever section I'm sitting in is usually Yankee pinstripes.  But this time, we had an especially annoying guy sitting in front of us with a couple of friends, but that was it for our section.  There wasn't really any competition in terms of ratio of Yankee fans to A's fans (until the end of the game when Yankee fans got really obnoxiously loud and had the majority - I probably should've left earlier but hey, who knows when miracles might happen?).  A's fans were much more numerous.  I'm not sure if that's because of the closed third deck and the limited seating capacity, but if it did, then it was a GREAT move.  The real test will be when the Red Sox come in, who seem to have even more fans now than even the Yankees.

And the Bill King ceremony was wonderful.  The sun even poked out for a few moments while the tribute was taking place.  Of course, some doofus had to ruin King's moment of silence by yelling, "Yankees suck."  I appreciate that sentiment, but save it for some other time, man.  Bill King gave us 20 incredible years, the least we could've done is give him 30 seconds of our respect.  I especially liked the idea of scrapping a ceremonial first pitch in favor of King's empty chair and microphone.

Finally, I have to say I was half-dreading coming home and seeing the open threads today.  I was expecting overreaction to the extreme.  But to my surprise and delight, it appears as though AN has turned a corner.  Thankfully.  There was joking overreaction, but for the most part people seemed calm and weren't predicting the sky was caving in.  It was a breath of fresh air because I expected the worst.  It was like deciding to go on vacation and leaving your 18-year-old son home alone with a stocked liquor cabinet and the keys to the Porsche.  I came home and the house wasn't destroyed and there was no sign of Rebecca De Mornay's presence anywhere.  Although I did find a pair of oaktoon's soiled tighty whities tucked in my couch, a Bob Seger record in my CD player and a crack in my decorative egg this morning.

Hmmmmmm...well, let me just say that I'm proud of AN for not collectively marching down to the Bay Bridge and going Jonestown on me.  I was relieved to find you all here in one piece.

Third Deck monstrosity
I agree that the diminished capacity kept the Yankee fan numbers down.  But other than that...
The tarps on the closed sections look low rent, like a failing neighborhood restaurant which hangs a beaded curtain to close off a main dining section which it cannot fill.  The facilities were in bad shape...bathrooms in Plaza Bleacher sections were closed until after the game started, and then many did not work.  Much to the distress of my stomach-flu addled companion.  And what's with the disappearing TV monitors?  It seemed like half or more of the ones which once adorned concession stands and overhung 2nd deck sections were gone.

Frankly, the whole thing felt like a conscious effort to get remaining cheapskates to move on up to $24 sections.  That, and to strengthen the self-fulfilling message that the Coliseum is unacceptable to the team.  The third deck is gone, but the third class ethic was pervasive.  Welcome to steerage; hardly any rats.

I'll never get over it
I will stop harping on it, eventually.  But of your "everyones" who say good things about the tarps, two groups are team employees (players and broadcasters) who assumedly know about biting that feeding hand, and the other, sportwriters, aren't remotely unanimous.

My franchise right or wrong
I think it's more a question of being good soldiers.  As an employee, if you like the move, say so; if you don't, say nothing.  People in every job do that, whether they need fear a pink slip or not.  And as for press, do you suppose Urban would still enjoy his cozy front office press relationship get if he started slamming Wolffish's schemes in print?  Or for that matter, if Slusser slammed 'em...or Blez?  That dynamic is certainly in play for beat press, who need those relationships to do their jobs.  Columnists have more leeway, hence Spander, and Purdy, and Shea, to name a few.

I agree.
It was the Yankee fans' diminished capacity that kept them from showing up last night.

yankees/sox fans
I still don't understand how reducing the capacity would reduce the percentage of visiting fans. My experience is that yankees and sox fans from Back East tend to buy their tickets for these games in advance, knowing that they only have one or two chances a year to see their team, while the last minute walkup sales are more likely to be Oakland fans. Last night's game (and tonight's) aren't representative, as they were included in all partial season ticket packages. Wednesday's game and the Red Sox series will be more representative.

I'd rather see a full house
that included Yankees and Sox fans than a half-empty stadium of only A's fans.  If Red Sox and Yankees fans want to help pay A's salaries, let them.

by kaweahkaweah on Apr 4, 2006 11:28 AM PDT up  
 
Because wrapping those
"Big Games" into a package of tickets, it means that A's fans have to buy those tickets in order to get the package deal.  It also means that those late coming Yankee fans won't be able to get tickets like they usually do.  How many of them came to FanFest for the tickets?
I've seen the A's play the Yankees many, many times and I've never, ever seen as few Yankee fans as I did last night.

Also, I expected to think the third deck was ugly, but I actually thought it looked pretty good.  Maybe it was my expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.

"HOLY TOLEDO!" Bill King
by 510inDenver on Apr 4, 2006 1:15 PM PDT up  
I privately went off the deep end last night
Its only one game, but I was majorly depressed following that debacle because:
A) Not just losing, but getting slammed on opening night (not going to make the casual fan want to come back after that one)
B) Having it happen against the Yankees
D) Zito getting crushed again in a big game
E) Bill King not there
F) The possibility the team moving hanging over our heads, not just to Fremont, but maybe out of the Bay Area. I don't know about others but I associate this team with Oakland and only Oakland.
G)Angels and Mets winning, two other teams I hate.
H)Chavez not coming through in the clutch again
I)Crosby getting hurt again
J)Zito saying he was being "too fine" again (just throw the darn ball!!!)

and K) it just sucks to lose...

Anyway, I wouldn't have blamed anyone for going overboard last night.  The sky isn't falling and its just one loss (they'll lose at least 60 more), but man, that was the worst immaginable way to open a season...I'd just like them to start the month off in a different way this year...winning some games.

by hillofbeanes on Apr 4, 2006 11:36 AM PDT  
 
Chavez not coming thru in the clutch?
They lost 15-2, where there hell is the clutch AB in a 15-2 game?  His only AB with the game in question was a ball he hit pretty well to Sheff.  Not to mention no lefties hit Unit anyways. Please, thats a load of crap.

Chavez not coming through isn't really a big deal
It was a very minor thing, I'm certainly not blaming him for the loss...I just hope through the season we'll see more consistent production with RISP...but obviously it was a tough pitcher and a tough game so no big deal...lets just get 'em today.

A different explanation
I noticed the smaller presence of Yankees fans and remembered that almost all season ticket plans sold prior to March had Opening Night in the package. That and the scarcity factor go hand-in-hand. Tonight could be a different story.

Unit Vs. Hurt?
 Randy is listed at 6-10, but I always thought it was more like 6-11.  Minor detail, but worth about 2 million a year more than the Hurt's 6-7... if this was the NBA.
 I can't get the image of two old millionaires running around the field on bad legs...one hobbling with a big wooden stick and the other loping, stopping every so often to pelt his pursuer with baseballs at 99 mph.  
 How good does it feel to know that when the other team is bound to buzz someone in retaliation we don't have to worry about Chavez getting one on the wrist anymore?  Throw at big Frank all you want...I don't think it bothers him much.  And throw at Milton, I dare you - just be prepared for the shiv he's going to pull out of his waistband as he charges you.

Milton and his shiv was classic.  Honestly, I'd like to see Milton start a fight or two.  We have the depth to cover and it would get the team fired up.
On another note I'd also like to see Coneo drilled by a 100mph fastball tonight in retaliation for spiking Crosby.

my only comment is
that harden should have started last night. harden is our ace. zito always seems to loose his focus in big games.
also, was it just me or was the ump calling the zone differently for the unit last night. it seems he was giving the unit the inside strike to righties, but not to zito. that being said, zito just needs to throw. and that being said, i trust zito will find it again, but it was a pretty disappointing start.

Weather was good.
King's chair on the pitcher's mound was great.  Guy who yelled "Yankees suck!" during moment of silence hopefully got his drunk ass shoved down the stairs later.  I thought A's fans were still majority even when crowd was only 4,000 in the 9th.  Zito sucked.  Bullpen listened to me at first -- was at about Zito pitch #43 when I said, "Could Saarloos please get up?"... couple of pitches later, he did.  (and no, I'm not suggesting that Saarloos be our "ace"...)
I can't remember which Yankee it was (Matsui?) that we could have had picked off 2nd because he was halfway to 3rd when Ellis caught a line drive and turned to throw it to the bag -- while Perez was what, picking his nose or something instead of covering 2nd.  Not that the A's were about to come roaring back if not for that blunder, but still... that kind of basic stuff just gets under my skin when it's not executed.

Ah well.  Like Jason Kendall said, "We still have 161 more of these to play."  I'll be there again tonight -- if they don't get rained out, which they probably will, in which case I'll be there tomorrow for both games.  Fortunately, I happen to be off work this week!  :)

Poppy, You and I...
Are totally on the same page! I was just about to post everything you just said.
My friend found the "Yankees Suck" guy amusing. It was the first time in our 11 year friendship I wanted to smack her. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he was our Jinx. It was uncalled for and immature and if we lost the game because of him, we deserved it.

My moment of Zito concern came at pitch #40. I looked up, saw that, and though, dear god, this is bad.

Perez not covering. I could tell by the look on Ellis's face, he was thinking the same thing you were. He made a brief motion to second and hesitated. I do recall I stood up and screamed something along the lines of "what the hell! He should have been out!"

161 games is a lot of games. And I think Rich will fix what went wrong last night.

I'd say Zito walking everyone and his cousin...

I kind of liked the "Yankees suck" guy
After all, he did wait to state the First Noble Truth of Baseball until about :50 into the moment of silence...unlike the young people in front of me who went on chatting throughout it, just in a quieter tone of voice.  
I'm sure it was accident rather than design, but Yankees Suck Guy timed it so that the replacement PA guy said "Thank you very much" almost immediately afterward.  That was why it was slightly amusing. Especially since the replacement PA guy had read his opening statement with a weirdly cheerful affect ("Llllllllladies and gentlemen!  Bill King died last year just after the end of the regular season!").  

And if there's one thing Bill was not, it was reverential.  He wouldn't have yelled that during anyone else's moment of silence, but I think he would have smiled to hear it in his own.

The Payton almost-catch
Btw, did anybody notice Payton kind of laughing when the ball bounced out of his glove after the Bradley and Kotsay dive/catches?  I was watching on TV and it seemed like he was totally conscious of the fact that he was going to make the third outfield circus catch in a row.  When he didn't actually come up with it, he seemed to be laughing at himself a bit.  A light-hearted moment in an otherwise depressing evening of baseball.
Let's get 'em tonight boys!

The other thing I noticed
is that Zito stuck around in the dugout for quite a while after he was pulled.  I remember seeing Hudson and Mulder get bombed a couple of times and then they disappeared into the clubhouse.
I know it doesn't seem like much, but Z remaining there and being supportive of the team was great.

by Tyler Bleszinski on Apr 4, 2006 12:37 PM PDT  
Or Billy was in the clubhouse
and Zito was scared.
Those new leather recliners are in there, after all.

But yeah, I saw that too and was happy to at least see Zito stick it out on the bench -- sitting through that, it must have felt like an eternity.

It really pissed me off
when a few losers behind me booed Barry when he was removed.  Kicking a man when he is down is pretty low.

Or DJ could have hugged him
until he returned to consciousness. Isn't that what those guys on the bench are for?
Poor Barry. :-/

by Kyli on Apr 4, 2006 12:50 PM PDT up  
I think DJ's job
is to remind me of Hatte everytime I see him. I bet he really misses Dad...
If anyone is going to hug Barry, it's Haren. Byrnes isn't here anymore so there's no competition.

It killed me the other day
during exhibition, there was a moment where it was a side-profile of DJ and I totally had a moment that I thought it was Hatty. :-( He shoulda kept #11, to be more like Dad.
...Good call on Haren, sounds about right.

"This must be heaven," he says.

I think DJ's job ...
... is to be packaged with Zito in a midseason trade, and then to outperform Swisher at the plate the next three years, thereby serving as a rejoinder to Beane's valuation of Swisher over DJ.

There's no way Beane trades DJ.
Think of the flood of emotions BB experiences whenever he sees Hatte Jr.

Facials!
Care to make a (virtual) wager on that? I think there's about 0% likelihood that Johnson is an A as of Opening Day '08. 50-50 that he's gone within a year.
Not that I'm advocating trading him -- quite the opposite.

Nope
I also believe that DJ will eventually be traded.

Maybe if he was wearing ...

by Rickeyfan on Apr 4, 2006 1:30 PM PDT up  
 
But if they do, it will be more for Barton, than a
anything to do with Swisher.  Swish can play the outfield, Barton and DJ only 1b.
by theblackpearl on Apr 4, 2006 1:18 PM PDT up  
 
true, dat
But I still think DJ will put up better numbers than Swish over the next three years (and could easily put up better numbers than Barton '07-08).

Zito sat on the bench and thought....
So did I just increase or decrease my chances of being in Pinstripes next year?  hmmmmmm.  This is gonna take some thought.....

I can't see most of the A's bench from my seat, so I couldn't tell whether he was still in the dugout after being pulled...

Chavy not coming through in the clutch
Let me clarify, obviously it wouldn't have made a difference in weather we won or loss...but still we had runners on base, it would have been nice to get a run in the 1st or 3rd inning...he's our big guy and I hope to see more improvemnt with RISP this year. It will make a difference when we are not getting blown out.
...and who knows, momentum can be more powerful than you would think

we were down 7-1 in the 3rd inning with two on...say  he doubles in the gap and it scores 2, then its 7-3 and still alot of time left with some confidence on our side...At least we would have put up a fight...

There were very few positives in this loss, and I'd really like to see chavy be more consistently productive at the plate.

by hillofbeanes on Apr 4, 2006 12:42 PM PDT  
In Zito's case
some of those walks were on blue, he was giving up on the pitch, had he followed it all the way to Jasons glove.....
Also give some credit to the big unit, he was good last night! <ducks>

by jb on Apr 4, 2006 12:44 PM PDT  
 
But that is the Zito dilemma, his stuff isn't
good enough for the constant swing through strikes, and if he's not getting the calls, the hitters won't swing at anything except that 88MPH BP fastball, which will get smoked by good hitters.

How many ANers were at the game that
actually wore the Bill King shirts?  I only counted a handful as I circled the concourse looking for chicken strips.
by Rickeyfan on Apr 4, 2006 1:22 PM PDT  
 
I actually saw about 10 people scanning
the audience wearing King tees.
by Tyler Bleszinski on Apr 4, 2006 1:28 PM PDT up  
 
I had my green & gold King shirt on
Didn't cover it up with my final layer until I just couldn't stand the chill any more, in about the 4th inning.

It was almost like a ...
secret club ... see another with the shirt ... 'nice shirt'  That said, I'm not wearing it again at night games until it gets warmer.  Brrr...
by Rickeyfan on Apr 4, 2006 4:24 PM PDT up  
I wore mine...
but I only saw one other person wearing a Bill King tee.  I have to say though that I wouldn't blame people for covering them up with a sweatshirt or jacket cuz it was a tad nippy. I had my sweatshirt and jacket on by the third.
   BTW,I went to the game with my Dad, whom I gave a tee for his b-day, and he got an ear full before the game for arriving to pick me up without it on.  
   While it would have been nice to see more tees last night, I hope to see them on people more as the weather goes from dreary/rainy to happy/sunshiny.

I spent Opening Day with Byrnsie....
It started off cool & cloudy here in Denver, and I was hanging out in the Rockpile, watching Byrnsie warm up in his new D-Backs threads.  He had a trunkfull of of Rockies & O's uniforms for sale earlier, that he had the Peanut/Cracker Jack guy selling.  Eric said it felt funny that he didn't have his old left field wall to crash into in the Collesium, and I said yeah, I know what you mean.  So I asked, what do you think about the game today?  And he said he was worried about Barry starting, and that he woulda liked to have been there to see Chavy get his glove. And I said, no I mean the game here, you know, with the Rockies.  He said oh yeah, I guess we'll prolly go to extras.  Funny he was right about everything.  So anyhow, he was really annoying me later.  He kept IMing me from his hotel asking about the score,(his hotel TV was broken) and I said why don't you go down to the hotel bar and watch it?  He said he hates ESPN coverage, and that they had some Avalanche game on the TV anyhow.   So anyway, I kept flipping back and forth between ESPN2 and the YES coverage, wondering why YES had the coverage for an A's homegame, and then Eric finally just called and told me I was dumb for wondering why.  So he said just chill and remember tehre are 161 more games.  So I did.  Eric has the day off today, and he asked me if I thought that it would be cool if he caught a Southwest flight out to Oakland to catch the game.  I said, don't you have a team rule about curfew?  He said yeah.  So he's coming over tonight, and will prolly leave his empties all over my living room.  Jeez.

The Rivercat Shakes!!
It seemed like all the ole Cat's had the heebs last nite...from Zito on down. On the other, the new guys looked really ready to rock. Crosby is a little ampy for me, I love it, but man he can't lay off high heat, trys to tomahawk homers every at bat, not good. He swings and fields, out of his boots. Maybe he should just be barefooted!! I might rotate the youngs cats to bench here early on and put Perez and Scut in the mix.

Bill King shirts
I had mine on, but under a few layers since it was cool--and wet on my feet.  I think you will see more when the weather warms up.
Bill was in everyone's hearts last night.  What a great tribute.

I have visited quite frequently
But as for the weather I was trying to get a description on the actual conditions in and around the stadium - is their lightning and raindrops big enoguh that they could smother a puppy? Online it reads that there are thunderstorms in the area until about 7:30 pm - followed by showers.
I don't exactly trust the internet weather however - and was trying to get some AN perspective on baseball condition weather?

by SD Erik on Apr 4, 2006 3:44 PM PDT up  
 
internet weather...
...said "thunder and hail" in my area (Redwood City, about 30 miles from stadium). But the sun has been shining for about 15 minutes now.
Yesterday's forecasts were all sounding like we'd be lucky if rain slowed down long enough for a game.  But it was relatively dry for most of the late afternoon and evening.

So I guess don't trust forecasts.  I'm leaving for Oakland in about half an hour, and even if it's raining, hailing, thundering and smothering puppies when I get there, we still probably won't know until about 7:00 whether they plan to play a baseball game...  :\
