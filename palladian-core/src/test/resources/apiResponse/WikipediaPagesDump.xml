'''Sherkin Island''', historically called '''Inisherkin''' ({{Irish place name|Inis Earcáin}}), lies southwest of [[County Cork]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] alongside other islands of Roaringwater Bay. It had a population of 106 people at the time of the 2006 Census,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures 3 miles long by 1.5 miles wide (5&amp;nbsp;km by 3&amp;nbsp;km). The island has a primary school, two [[Public houses|pubs]], a hotel, [[Bed and breakfast|B&amp;B]], community centre and a [[Roman Catholic]] church.

==Climate==
Sherkin is the second most southerly point of Ireland after Cape Clear.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} It is said that when the frost covers the lawns of [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]] just across the bay, the grass remains unfrosted on the island.  Like any other coastal part of Ireland, Sherkin can be affected by heavy coastal gales.

==Population==
Sherkin once had a population of around 1,000, which started to decline during the [[Great Irish Famine]] in the mid-19th Century.  Now the population is reduced and varies between the summer and the winter months, with increases in summer as people return to holiday houses and tourists arrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;sherkinisland&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherkinisland.eu/ |title=Sherkin Island - West Cork - Ireland |publisher=Sherkinisland.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People from all over the globe have settled on Sherkin.{{fact|date=April 2013}} Amongst Sherkiners one can find artists, book writers, craft workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandscrafts.com |title=Islands Crafts |publisher=Islands Crafts |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; musicians, photographers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherkinphoto.com |title=Terry Farnell Photography, Sherkin Island: |publisher=Sherkinphoto.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mahons.org&lt;/ref&gt; beekeepers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeforvisitors.com/europe/countries/ireland/walking-in-ireland-sherkin-island-12.htm |title=Sherkin Island Beekeeper |publisher=Europe for Visitors |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; pilots, cattle, mussel and oyster farmers, biologists, botanists and oceanologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sherkinisland.eu/galeria1/imagepages/image63.html |title=DSC01137.JPG |publisher=Sherkinisland.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; fishermen and sailors, teachers and doctors, horselovers and strawberry growers.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

==Transport==
Sherkin's ferry boat is named &quot;Mystic Waters&quot;, and during the summer (roughly 1 June-30 September) it makes ten daily trips from 07.45 to 20.30 on weekdays, from 9.00 on Saturdays and from 10.30 on Sundays.  During the winter months the last ferry leaves Baltimore at 17.30, with later ferries on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sherkinisland.eu/index.php/ferry |title=Ferry &amp;#124; Sherkin Island - West Cork - Ireland |publisher=Sherkinisland.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roads on Sherkin are narrow and often in poor condition.  Most of the cars on the island are old and unsuitable for use on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeforvisitors.com/europe/countries/ireland/walking-in-ireland-sherkin-island-4.htm |title=Sherkin Island Cars |publisher=Europe for Visitors |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycling and walking are popular, with an occasional horse ride also an option. There is a rural transport service on the island, it meets every ferry and costs €2 per trip.

==History==
There are a number of important archaeological remains on Sherkin, with some of them being restored.  A [[friary]], the Mainster Inis Arcain, is just uphill from the ferry pier. The seat of the O'Driscoll Clan was Dun-na-Long Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/opencountry_20020824.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 - Open Country |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two buildings were heavily damaged in [[1537 in Ireland|1537]] when citizens of Waterford invaded the island after a dispute over a seized and plundered ship.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Sherkin has an automated [[lighthouse]], maintained by locals. It is situated at Barrack Point and dates back to 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverireland.ie/Ireland-s-Islands/South-West-(Cork)/Sherkin-Island Discoverireland.ie - Sherkin]&lt;/ref&gt; The lighthouse marks the southern entrance to Baltimore Harbour, along with the Baltimore Beacon.  On the south-western side of the island there is a functioning Roman Catholic church. The main historic sites include:
* [[Promontory fort]] - Celtic Iron Age - 600 B.C. - 400 A.D.
* [[Franciscan]] friary - Medieval - post 1200 A.D.
* O'Mahony Castle - Medieval - post 1200 A.D.

==Tourism==
The ferry to Sherkin sails from [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]] on the mainland.  The island is a tourist destination and it normally takes less than 15 minutes to get to Sherkin from Baltimore. The journey to the neighbouring [[Gaeltacht]] island [[Cape Clear Island|Cape Clear]] takes on average approximately 40 minutes. Many of Sherkin's residents are active in the fields of [[art]]: island [[craft]], [[painting]]s and [[book]] writing. The busiest season starts with school summer holidays when people with young families visit the island.  

===Regatta===
The busiest day of the year coincides with the Sherkin Regatta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimore.ie/regattas/sherkin-island-regatta.html |title=Sherkin Island Regatta - Sherkin Island Regatta |publisher=Baltimore.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Regatta|rowing regatta]] usually held on the 3rd weekend in July, but which is postponed to August if weather does not allow.  On this day the island is crowded with [[Coastal and ocean rowing|sea rowers]] and their supporters. Children's activities, music and food stalls are all part of this Sherkin fair.

===Tours===
Visitors can take a direct ferry trip to Sherkin or book a sea safari trip around the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoreseasafari.ie/ |title=Baltimore Sea Safari |publisher=Baltimoreseasafari.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists can also avail of guided tours around the islands. Once on Sherkin pier, people can visit the Franciscan friary, if it is open.  It is locally known as &quot;the Abbey&quot; and has a photo exhibition inside and some displays outside. Tourists can climb up the stairs on to an open landing to observe local scenery: the Baltimore beacon, Baltimore harbour, Sherkin pier, island landscape and the old post office. Many visitors go straight to the beach (Silver Strand, Cow Strand or Trabawn) and visit local exhibitions on the way or visit Horseshoe Harbour.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

===Camping and picnicking===
In autumn, there are abundant wild [[blackberries]], which are picked by people and used to make blackberry [[Fruit preserves|Jam]], blackberry tarts and other confections.

Sherkin also has camp facilities. Because the island has no local refuse disposal facilities, all campers and picnickers are encouraged to bring minimum packaging and make sure to take the litter back to the mainland or recycle cans and bottles on Sherkin pier.
The best place for barbecues is Silver Strand where there is a choice of soft grass or warm sand to rest on.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

== Development ==
The island has a local development officer.  It has its community based organisation called [[SIDS (Sherkin Island Development Society)]].

'''Dresden''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdʁeːsdᵊn}}; {{lang-hsb|Drježdźany}}) is the capital city&lt;ref&gt;Designated by article 2 of the [http://web.archive.org/web/20080131113213/http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/de/infothek/volksvertretung/popup_verfassung.html Saxon Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Free State of Saxony]] in [[Germany]]. It is situated in a valley on the River [[Elbe]], near the [[Czech republic|Czech border]]. The Dresden [[conurbation]] is part of the [[Saxon triangle|Saxon Triangle]] metropolitan area with 2.4 million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Region Sachsendreieck: [http://www.region-sachsendreieck.de/mrs/de/top/karte/ Map of the Sachsendreieck (Saxon triangle)]&lt;/ref&gt; Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the [[Prince-Elector|Electors]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Kings of Saxony]], who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendour. 
The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its [[baroque]] and [[rococo]] city centre. A controversial [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allied aerial bombing]] towards the end of World War II killed 25,000 civilians and destroyed the entire city centre. The impact of the bombing and 40 years of urban development during the [[East Germany|East German]] communist era have considerably changed the face of the city. Some restoration work has helped to reconstruct parts of the historic inner city, including the [[Katholische Hofkirche]], the [[Semper Oper]] and the [[Dresdner Frauenkirche]]. Since the [[German reunification]] in 1990, Dresden has regained  importance as one of the cultural, educational, political and economic centres of Germany and Europe.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Dresden history}}
Although Dresden is a relatively recent city of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] origin,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dresden.de&quot;&gt;''Dresden.de''. [http://www.dresden.de/en/02/07/01/c_01.php &quot;Prehistoric times&quot;]. Retrieved 24 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the area had been settled in the [[Neolithic]] era by [[Linear Pottery culture]] tribes ca. [[8th millennium BC|7500 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Rengert Elburg: [http://www.academia.edu/1160390/Man-animal_relationships_in_the_Early_Neolithic_of_Dresden_Saxony_Germany_ Man-animal relationships in the Early Neolithic of Dresden (Saxony, Germany)]&lt;/ref&gt; Dresden's founding and early growth is associated with the [[Ostsiedlung|eastward expansion of Germanic peoples]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dresden.de&quot;/&gt; mining in the nearby [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]], and the establishment of the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Its name etymologically derives from Old Sorbian ''Drežďany'', meaning ''people of the forest''. Dresden later evolved into the capital of [[Saxony]].

===Early history===

[[File:Cortège des Princes.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Fürstenzug]]—the Saxon sovereigns depicted in [[Meissen porcelain]]]]
Around the late 12th century, a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlement called ''Drežďany''&lt;ref name=&quot;Löffler&quot;&gt;Fritz Löffler, ''Das alte Dresden'', Leipzig 1982, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; had developed on the southern bank. Another settlement existed on the northern bank, but its Slavic name is unclear. It was known as ''Antiqua Dresdin'' verifiable since 1350 and later as Altendresden,&lt;ref name=&quot;Löffler&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/infoblaetter/historie_altendresden.pdf?PHPSESSID=3b1a560f5b42d55b28790331bf486b97 Geschichtlicher Hintergrund des Jubiläums &quot;600 Jahre Stadtrecht Altendresden&quot; (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; both literally &quot;old Dresden&quot;. [[Dietrich, Margrave of Meissen]], chose Dresden as his interim residence in 1206, as documented in a record calling the place &quot;Civitas Dresdene&quot;.

After 1270, Dresden became the capital of the margravate. It was restored to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] dynasty in about 1319. From 1485, it was the seat of the [[duke]]s of Saxony, and from 1547 the [[Prince-elector|electors]] as well.

===Modern age===
The [[Rulers of Saxony|Elector]] and ruler of Saxony Frederick [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony|Augustus I]] became King [[Augustus II of Poland|August the Strong]] of [[Poland]] in [[personal union]]. He gathered many of the best musicians,&lt;ref&gt;[http://earlymusicworld.com/id16.html Dresden in the Time of Zelenka and Hasse]&lt;/ref&gt; architects and painters from all over Europe to Dresden. His reign marked the beginning of Dresden's emergence as a leading European city for technology and art. Dresden suffered heavy destruction in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), following its capture by Prussian forces, its subsequent re-capture, and a failed [[Siege of Dresden|Prussian siege]] in 1760. [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote his [[Ode to Joy]] (the literary base of the [[European anthem]]) for the Dresden [[Masonic Lodge]] in 1785. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The city of Dresden had a distinctive silhouette, captured in famous paintings by [[Bernardo Bellotto]] and by Norwegian painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]].

Between 1806 and 1918 the city was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (which was a part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871). During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the [[Napoleon|French emperor]] made it a [[Headquarters|base of operations]], winning there the famous [[Battle of Dresden]] on 27 August 1813. Dresden was a centre of the [[German Revolution]]s in 1848 with the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May Uprising]], which cost human lives and damaged the historic town of Dresden. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

During the 19th century the city became a major centre of economy, including [[Automobile|motor car]] production, food processing, banking and the manufacture of [[medical equipment]]. 

In the early 20th century Dresden was particularly well known for its camera works and its cigarette factories. Between 1918 and 1934 Dresden was capital of the first Free State of Saxony. Dresden was a centre of European [[modern art]] until 1933.

====Military history====
[[File:Dresden photochrom2.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of Dresden during the 1890s, before extensive World War II destruction. Landmarks include [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], [[Augustus Bridge]], and [[Katholische Hofkirche]].]]

During the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, a large military facility called Albertstadt was built.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdiger Nern, Erich Sachße, Bert Wawrzinek. ''Die Dresdner Albertstadt''. Dresden, 1994; ''Albertstadt&amp;nbsp;– sämtliche Militärbauten in Dresden''. Dresden, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; It had a capacity of up to 20,000 [[Soldier|military personnel]] at the beginning of the First World War. The garrison saw only limited use between 1918 and 1934, but was then reactivated in preparation for the Second World War.

Its usefulness was limited by attacks on 17 April 1945&lt;ref name=&quot;USAFHSO_Analysis&quot;&gt;[[United States Air Force|Air Force Historical Studies Office]]: [http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE 14–15 FEBRUARY 1945 BOMBINGS OF DRESDEN] including a list of all bombings&lt;/ref&gt; on the railway network (especially towards Bohemia).&lt;ref&gt;Bergander, Götz. ''Dresden im Luftkrieg'': Vorgeschichte-Zerstörung-Folgen, p. 251 ff. Verlag Böhlau 1994, ISBN 3-412-10193-1&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers had been deployed as late as March 1945 in the Albertstadt garrison. 

The Albertstadt garrison became the headquarters of the [[Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army]] in the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]] after the war. Apart from the [[German Army|German army]] officers' school (''Offizierschule des Heeres''), there have been no more [[military unit]]s in Dresden since the army merger during German reunification, and the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1992. Nowadays, the Bundeswehr operates the [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr|Military History Museum]] of the Federal Republic of Germany in the former Albertstadt garrison.

[[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German Federal Minister of Defence]] [[Thomas de Maizière]] has his place of residence and political basis in Dresden.

===Second World War===

{{Main|Bombing of Dresden in World War II}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0309-310, Zerstörtes Dresden.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dresden, 1945—over ninety percent of the city centre was destroyed.]]

Dresden in the 20th century was a major communications hub and manufacturing centre, as well as a leading European centre of art, classical music, culture and science until its complete destruction on 13 February 1945. Being the capital of the German state of [[Saxony]], Dresden had not only garrisons but a whole ''military borough'', the ''Albertstadt''. This military complex, named after [[Saxon]] King Albert, was not specifically targeted in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] though was within the expected area of destruction.

During the final months of World War II, Dresden became a haven to some 600,000 refugees, with a total population of {{Nowrap|1.2 million}}. Dresden was attacked seven times between 1944 and 1945, and was occupied by the [[Red Army]] after German capitulation.

The [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) between 13 and 15 February 1945 remains a controversial Allied action of the Western European [[theatre (warfare)|theatre of war]]. 

The inner city of Dresden was largely destroyed by 722 RAF and 527 USAAF bombers that dropped 2431 tons of high explosive bombs, and 1475.9 tons of incendiaries.&lt;ref&gt;On the night of the 13th/14th RAF Bomber command dispatched 796 Lancasters and 9 Mosquitos in two raids as part of Operation Thunderclap dropping &quot;1,478 tons of high explosive and 1,182 tons of incendiary bombs&quot; ([http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb45.html RAF Bomber Command 60th Anniversary – Campaign Diary February 1945])&lt;/ref&gt; The high explosive bombs damaged buildings and exposed their wooden structures, while the incendiaries ignited them, severely reducing the number of shelters available to the retreating German troops and refugees.

Widely quoted Nazi propaganda reports claimed 200,000 deaths.  The German [[Dresden Historians' Commission]], in an official 2010 report published after five years of research concluded there were up to 25,000 casualties, while right-wing groups continue to claim that up to 500,000 people died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8574157.stm BBC: Up to 25,000 died in Dresden's WWII bombing&amp;nbsp;– report, 18 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The inhabited city centre was almost wiped out, while larger residential, industrial and military sites on the outskirts were relatively unscathed. The Allies described the operation as the legitimate bombing of a military and industrial target.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAFHSO_Analysis&quot;&gt;[[United States Air Force|Air Force Historical Studies Office]]: [http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm Historical Analysis of the 14–15 February 1945 Bombings Of Dresden]{{Dead link|date=October 2011}} including a list of all bombings&lt;/ref&gt; A report from the [[RAF Bomber Command|British Bomber Command]] stated the military target was the railway marshalling yard Dresden-Friedrichstadt. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] later distanced himself from the attack, even though he was heavily involved with the planning of the raid. Several researchers have argued that the February attacks were [[Proportionality (law)#International law|disproportionate]].

American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' is based on his first hand experience of the raid as a [[POW]]. In remembrance of the victims, the anniversaries of the bombing of Dresden are marked with peace demonstrations, devotions and marches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4030017,00.html?maca=en-DKpartner_yg_infomix_en-2315-xml-mrss |title=On Dresden Anniversary, Massive Protest Against Neo-Nazi March &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; Deutsche Welle &amp;#124; 14.02.2009 |publisher=Dw-world.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geh-denken.de/joomla/ |title=Geh Denken&amp;nbsp;– Startseite |publisher=Geh-denken.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war period===
After the Second World War, Dresden became a major industrial centre in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (former East Germany) with a great deal of research infrastructure. Many important historic buildings were rebuilt, including the [[Semper Opera House]], the [[Zwinger]] Palace and a great many other historic  buildings, although the city leaders chose to reconstruct large areas of the city in a &quot;socialist modern&quot; style, partly for economic reasons, but also to break away from the city's past as the royal capital of Saxony and a stronghold of the German bourgeoisie. However, some of the bombed-out ruins of churches, royal buildings and palaces, such as the Gothic [[Sophienkirche]], the [[Alberttheater]] and the [[Wackerbarth-Palais]] were razed by the Soviet and East German authorities in the 1950s and 1960s instead of being repaired. Compared to [[West Germany]], the majority of historic buildings were saved{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

From 1985 to 1990, the KGB stationed [[Vladimir Putin]], the future [[President of the Russian Federation|President of Russia]], in Dresden. On 3 October 1989 (the so-called &quot;battle of Dresden&quot;), a convoy of trains carrying East German refugees from [[Prague]] passed through Dresden on its way to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. Local activists and residents joined in the growing [[civil disobedience]] movement spreading across the German Democratic Republic by staging demonstrations and demanding the removal of the nondemocratic government.

===Post-reunification===
[[File:Sonnedd.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], a few years after its reconsecration]]

Dresden has experienced dramatic changes since the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s. The city still bears many wounds from the [[Strategic bombing|bombing raids]] of 1945, but it has undergone significant reconstruction in recent decades. Restoration of the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] was completed in 2005, a year before Dresden's 800th anniversary, notably by privately raised funds. The gold cross on the top of the church was paid for and donated by the City of [[Edinburgh]] as a mark of the bond between the two cities. The [[urban renewal]] process, which includes the reconstruction of the area around the [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt square]] on which the Frauenkirche is situated, will continue for many decades, but public and government interest remains high, and there are numerous large projects underway—both historic reconstructions and modern plans—that will continue the city's recent architectural renaissance.

Dresden remains a major cultural centre of historical memory, owing to the city's destruction in World War II. Each year on 13 February, the anniversary of the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|British and American fire-bombing raid]] that destroyed most of the city, tens of thousands of demonstrators gather to commemorate the event. Since reunification, the ceremony has taken on a more neutral and pacifist tone (after being used more politically in [[Cold War]] times). In recent years, however, [[white power skinhead]]s have tried to use the event for their own political ends. In the last ten year Dresden was host to some of the largest [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] demonstrations in the post-war [[history of Germany]]. Each year around the anniversary of the [[Dresden bombing|bombing of Dresden in World War II]] Neo-Nazis demonstrated to &quot;mourn&quot; what they call the &quot;[[Allied]] bomb-[[holocaust]]&quot;. From 2010 on, these demonstrations were prevented by [[The nazi marches and counter-mobilisation in Dresden|antifascist counter-mobilisations]] who successfully blocked the annual Nazi-marches.

The completion of the reconstructed Dresden Frauenkirche in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the [[Dresden Neumarkt|Neumarkt]] area. The areas around the square have been divided into 8 &quot;Quarters&quot;, with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings to be rebuilt either to the original structure or at least with a façade similar to the original. Quarter I and the front section of Quarters II, III, IV and V(II) have since been completed, with Quarter VIII currently under construction.

In 2002, torrential rains caused the [[Elbe]] to flood {{convert|9|m}} above its normal height, i.e. even higher than the old record height from 1845, damaging many landmarks (See [[2002 European flood]]). The destruction from this &quot;millennium flood&quot; is no longer visible, due to the speed of reconstruction.

The United Nations' cultural organisation [[UNESCO]] declared the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] to be a World Heritage Site in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1156 Dresden Elbe Valley], UNESCO World Heritage Register.

The [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] was an internationally recognised site of cultural significance by the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Committee]] for five years. After being placed on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger|list of endangered World Heritage Sites]] in 2006, the city had its status as world heritage site formally removed in June 2009, for the wilful breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, due to the construction of a highway bridge across the valley within 2&amp;nbsp;km of the historic centre. It thereby became the first location ever in Europe to lose this status, and the second ever in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/25/dresden-bridge-unesco-heritage-status |title=Bridge takes Dresden off Unesco world heritage list &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 25 June 2009|accessdate=2009-11-01 | location=London | first=Kate | last=Connolly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography and urban development of Dresden}}

===Location===
[[File:2011-08-28 Basteibrücke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saxon Switzerland]] a few kilometres outside of Dresden]]
Dresden lies on both banks of the river Elbe, mostly in the [[Dresden Basin]], with the further reaches of the eastern [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]] to the south, the steep slope of the [[Lusatia]]n granitic crust to the north, and the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] to the east at an altitude of about {{convert|113|m|ft|abbr=off}}.  Triebenberg is the highest point in Dresden at {{convert|384|m|ft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;basicGeoData&quot;&gt;Dresden.de: [http://www.dresden.de/en/02/06/c_01.php Location, area, geographical data]&lt;/ref&gt;

With a pleasant location and a mild climate on the Elbe, as well as Baroque-style architecture and numerous world-renowned museums and art collections, Dresden has been called &quot;Elbflorenz&quot; ([[Florence]] of the [[Elbe]]).
The incorporation of neighbouring [[Types of rural communities|rural communities]] over the past 60 years has made Dresden the fourth largest [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] by area in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, and [[Cologne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cityList&quot;&gt;[[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearest German cities are [[Chemnitz]] {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the southwest, [[Leipzig]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the northwest and Berlin {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north. [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] is about {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the south and to the east {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=off}} is the [[List of cities in Poland|Polish city]] of [[Breslau]]/ [[Wrocław]].

===Nature===
Dresden is one of the greenest cities in all of Europe, with 63% of the city being green areas and forests. The [[Dresden Heath]] (''Dresdner Heide'') to the north is a forest 50&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size. There are four [[nature reserve]]s.  The additional Special Conservation Areas cover 18&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The protected gardens, parkways, parks and old graveyards host 110 natural monuments in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Dresden: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080204222646/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=6943 Dresden—a Green city]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] is a former world heritage site which is focused on the conservation of the [[cultural landscape]] in Dresden.  One important part of that landscape is the Elbe meadows, which cross the city in a 20 kilometre swath. [[Saxon Switzerland]] is an important nearby location.

===Climate===
Dresden has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Dfb]]), with hotter summers and colder winters than the German average.  The average temperature in February is {{convert|-1.7|°C|2|abbr=on}} and in July {{convert|18.1|°C|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[German Weather Service|Deutscher Wetterdienst]]: [http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/online/nat/index_mittelwerte.htm ''Average of the period from 1961 to 1990'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The inner city temperature is {{convert|10.2|°C|1|abbr=on}} averaged over the year.  The driest months are February and March, with precipitation of {{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The wettest months are July and August, with {{convert|61|mm|1|abbr=on}} per month.

The microclimate in the [[Elbe valley]] differs from that on the slopes and in the higher areas. [[Klotzsche]], at 227 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], hosts the Dresden [[weather station]]. The weather in Klotzsche is 1 to {{convert|1|to|3|C-change|F-change|1|abbr=on}} colder than in the [[inner city]].

===Flood protection===
[[File:Flood dresden april2006 004.jpg|thumb|Elbe Flood in April 2006: Dresden is often endangered by manageable floods while disastrous events as in 2002 or 1845 are not likely to happen twice within a hundred years.]]
Because of its location on the banks of the Elbe, into which some water sources from the Ore Mountains flow, flood protection is important. Large areas are kept free of buildings to provide a flood plain. Two additional trenches, about 50 metres wide, have been built to keep the inner city free of water from the Elbe, by dissipating the water downstream through the inner city's gorge portion. Flood regulation systems like [[detention basin]]s and [[water reservoir]]s are almost all outside the [[Urban area|city area]].

The [[Weißeritz]], normally a rather small river, suddenly ran directly into the main station of Dresden during the [[2002 European floods]]. This was largely because the river returned to its former route; it had been diverted so that a railway could run along the river bed.

Many locations and areas need to be protected by walls and sheet pilings during floods. A number of districts become waterlogged if the Elbe overflows across some of its former floodplains.

===City structuring===
[[File:Luftbildaufnahme des Großen Gartens in Dresden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Großer Garten]] in Dresden]]
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Dresden is a spacious city. Its districts differ in their structure and appearance. Many parts still contain an old village core, while some quarters are almost completely preserved as rural settings. Other characteristic kinds of urban areas are the historic outskirts of the city, and the former suburbs with scattered housing. During the German Democratic Republic, many apartment blocks were built. The original parts of the city are almost all in the districts of Altstadt (Old town) and Neustadt (New town). Growing outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]], the historic outskirts were built in the 18th century. They were planned and constructed on the orders of the Saxon monarchs, which is why the outskirts are often named after sovereigns. From the 19th century the city grew by incorporating other districts. Dresden has been divided into ten districts called &quot;Ortsamtsbereich&quot; and nine former boroughs (&quot;Ortschaften&quot;) which have been incorporated.

===Demography===
The population of Dresden reached 100,000 inhabitants in 1852, making it the third German city to reach that number.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityList&quot;/&gt; The population peaked at 649,252 in 1933, but dropped to 450,000 in 1946 as the result of World War II, during which large residential areas of the city were destroyed. After large incorporations and city restoration, the population grew to 522,532 again between 1950 and 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;demogr1&quot;&gt;Dresden: [http://dresden.de/de/02/06/c_020_Einwohnerzahl.php Einwohnerzahl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[German reunification]], demographic development has been very unsteady. The city has had to struggle with migration and suburbanisation. The population increased to 480,000 as a consequence of several incorporations during the 1990s, but it fell to 452,827 in 1998. Between 2000 and 2010, the population grew quickly by more than 45,000 inhabitants (about 9.5%) due to a stabilised economy and reurbanisation. Along with [[Munich]] and [[Potsdam]], Dresden is one of the ten fastest-growing cities in Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;cityList&quot;/&gt; while the population of the surrounding [[new federal states]] is still shrinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;demogr1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statistical office of the Free State of Saxony: [http://www.statistik.sachsen.de/englisch/Seiten/unterseite42.htm Population and area of Saxony from 1815 on]&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the city of Dresden is 523,058 (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistik.sachsen.de/21/02_02/02_02_01_tabelle.asp |author=State Office for statistics of Saxony |title=Population of Saxon cities and communities |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the population of the Dresden agglomeration is 780,561 (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Deutschland-Agglo.html|author=citypopulation.de quoting Federal Statistics Office|title=Principal Agglomerations (of Germany)|accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population of Region Dresden (which includes the neighbouring districts of [[Meißen (district)|Meißen]], [[Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge]] and the western part of the district of [[Bautzen (district)|Bautzen]]) is 1,143,197 (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://region.dresden.de/region/portraet/statistik.php|author=Region Dresden|title=Statistical data of the Dresden Region|accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Dresden is one of the few German Cities which have more inhabitants than ever since World War II.

In Dresden, about 51.3% of the population is female. Foreigners account for about 4%.&lt;ref&gt;Dresden: [http://dresden.de/en/02/06/c_02.php Population]&lt;/ref&gt; The mean age of the population is 43 years, which is the lowest among the urban districts in Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical office of the Free State of Saxony: [http://www.statistik.sachsen.de/12/pressearchiv/archiv2007/pm15907.htm Sachsen sind im Durchschnitt 45 Jahre alt&amp;nbsp;– Dresdner am jüngsten, Hoyerswerdaer am ältesten] (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
{{Main|City Council of Dresden}}
Dresden is one of Germany's 16 political centres and the capital of Saxony. It has institutions of democratic local self-administration that are independent from the capital functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070312043329/http://www.jura.uos.de/institut/jkr/gosachse.htm Gemeindeordnung für den Freistaat Sachsen (SächsGemO), §2]&lt;/ref&gt; Some local affairs of Dresden receive national attention.

Dresden hosted some international summits such as the [[Petersburg Dialogue]] between Russia and Germany, the European Union's [[Interior minister|Minister of the Interior]] conference and the [[G8]] labor ministers conference in recent years.

===Municipality and city council===
The [[City council|City Council]] defines the basic principles of the municipality by decrees and statutes. The council gives orders to the &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; (&quot;Burgomaster&quot; or Mayor) by voting for resolutions and thus has some executive power.&lt;ref&gt;Dresden.de: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080205031703/http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_04.php City Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no stable governing majority on Dresden city council.&lt;ref&gt;Dresden: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080205031703/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=6948 City Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Burgomaster|Supreme Burgomaster]] is directly elected by the citizens for a term of seven years. Executive functions are normally elected indirectly in Germany. However, the Supreme Burgomaster shares numerous executive rights with the city council. He/She is the executive head of the municipality, and also the ceremonial representative of the city. The main departments of the municipality are managed by seven burgomasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080205031638/http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_01.php Dresden.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local affairs===
[[File:Landhaus Dresden Treppe.jpg|thumb|Architecture (like the &quot;deconstructivist&quot; fire escape on the baroque [[Landhaus (Dresden)|Landhaus]]) is a persistent subject of controversy in Dresden]]

Local affairs in Dresden often centre around the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city and its spaces. Architecture and the design of [[public space|public places]] is a controversial subject. Discussions about the [[Waldschlößchenbrücke]], a bridge under construction across the Elbe, received international attention because of its position across the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Its construction caused the loss of World Heritage site status in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]]: [http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/265  World Heritage Committee threatens to remove Dresden Elbe Valley (Germany) from World Heritage List]&lt;/ref&gt; The city held a public referendum in 2005 on whether to build the bridge, prior to UNESCO expressing doubts about the compatibility between bridge and heritage.

In 2006 Dresden sold its publicly subsidised housing organisation, WOBA Dresden GmbH, to the US-based private [[investment company]] [[Fortress Investment Group]]. The city received {{Nowrap|987.1 million}} euro and paid off its remaining loans, making it the first large city in Germany to become debt-free. Opponents of the sale were concerned about Dresden's loss of control over the [[Subsidised housing|subsidised housing market]].&lt;ref&gt;Dresden: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080204222643/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=33040 Selling of the WOBA Dresden GmbH (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations==

===Twin towns – sister cities===

Along with its [[town twinning|twin city]] [[Coventry]], Dresden was one of the first two cities to twin with a foreign city. Similar symbolism occurred in 1988, when Dresden twinned with the Dutch city of [[Rotterdam]]. The cities became twins after World War II in an act of reconciliation, as they had suffered incisive destructions from bombings. The [[Coventry Blitz]] and [[Rotterdam Blitz]] bombardments of the German [[Luftwaffe]] are also considered to be [[Proportionality (law)#International law|disproportional]]. Dresden has had a triangular partnership with [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Hamburg]] since 1987.

==Culture and architecture==
{{Main|Culture in Dresden}}
[[File:Dresden-Altstadt von der Marienbruecke-II.jpg|thumb|Dresden at blue hour]]
[[File:Frauenkirche silhouette.jpg|thumb|[[Dresden Frauenkirche]], symbol of Dresden]]
Dresden is seeking to regain the kind of cultural importance it held from the 19th century until the 1920s, when it was a centre of art, architecture and music. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and [[Richard Wagner]] had a number of their works performed for the first time in Dresden. Other famous artists, such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Gottfried Semper]] and [[Gret Palucca]], were also active in the city. Dresden is also home to several important art collections, world-famous musical ensembles, and significant buildings from various [[architectural history|architectural periods]], many of which were rebuilt after the destruction of the Second World War.

===Entertainment===
[[File:Semperoper Dresden.jpg|thumb|The [[Semperoper]], completely rebuilt and reopened in 1985]]
The Saxon State Opera descends from the opera company of the former electors and Kings of Saxony in the [[Semperoper]]. After being completely destroyed during the bombing of Dresden during the WWII, the opera's reconstruction was completed exactly 40 years later, on February 13, 1985. Its musical ensemble is the ''[[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]]'', founded in 1548.&lt;ref&gt;Semperoper: [http://www.semperoper.de/en/staatskapelle/history.html History of the Sächsische Staatskapelle]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Staatsschauspiel Dresden|Dresden State Theatre]] runs a number of smaller theatres.  The Dresden State Operetta is the only independent [[operetta]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staatsoperette-dresden.de/en Staatsoperette Dresden]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Herkuleskeule'' ([[Hercules]] [[club (weapon)|club]]) is an important site in [[Kabarett|German-speaking political cabaret]].

There are several choirs in Dresden, the best-known of which is the [[Dresdner Kreuzchor]] (Choir of [[Christian cross|The Holy Cross]]). It is a boys' choir drawn from pupils of the [[Kreuzschule]], and was founded in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kreuzchor.de/english/chor.php Kreuzchor]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dresdner Kapellknaben'' are not related to the ''Staatskapelle'', but to the former ''Hofkapelle'', the Catholic cathedral, since 1980.  The [[Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]] is the orchestra of the city of Dresden.

Throughout the summer, the outdoor concert series &quot;Zwingerkonzerte und Mehr&quot; is held in the [[Zwinger]]hof.  Performances include dance and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=steffen wollmerstaedt |url=http://www.dresden-theater.de |title=Landesbühnen Sachsen l Dresden l Theater l Rathen l Zwinger l Sachsen |publisher=Dresden-theater.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A big event each year in June is the [[Bunte Republik Neustadt]].

===Museums, presentations and collections===
Dresden hosts the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden|''Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden'']] (Dresden State Art Collections) which, according to the institution's own statements, place it among the most important museums presently in existence. The art collections consist of twelve museums, of which the ''[[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]'' (Old Masters Gallery) and the ''[[Grünes Gewölbe]]'' (Green Vault) are the most famous.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/museen.html Museums]&lt;/ref&gt; Also known are ''[[Galerie Neue Meister]]'' (New Masters Gallery), ''[[Dresden Armory|Rüstkammer]]'' (Armoury) with the [[Dresden Armory#Turkish Chamber|Turkish Chamber]], and the ''[[Dresden Museum of Ethnology|Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden]]'' (Museum of Ethnology).

Other museums and collections owned by the Free State of Saxony in Dresden are:
* The ''[[German Hygiene Museum|Deutsche Hygiene-Museum]]'', founded for [[mass education]] in hygiene, health, [[human biology]] and medicine&lt;ref&gt;Deutsches Hygiene-Museum: [http://www.dhmd.de/neu/index.php?id=923 Deutsches Hygiene-Museum – The Museum of Man]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte'' (State Museum of Prehistory)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archsax.sachsen.de/lmv/content/288_DEU_Screen.htm State Museum of Prehistory]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Staatliche Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden'' (State Collection of Natural History)
* The ''Universitätssammlung Kunst + Technik'' (Collection of Art and Technology of the Dresden University of Technology)
* ''[[Dresden Transport Museum|Verkehrsmuseum Dresden]]'' (Transport Museum)
* ''Festung Dresden'' (Dresden Fortress)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festung-dresden.de/ Festung Dresden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dresdner-verein-bruehlsche-terrasse.de/seiten/frameset.htm Dresdner Verein Brühlsche Terrasse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dresden City Museum]] is run by the city of Dresden and focused on the city's history. The ''[[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr]]'' (Military History Museum) is placed in the former garrison in the Albertstadt.

The book museum of the [[Saxon State Library]] presents the famous [[Dresden Codex]].
The [[Botanischer Garten der Technischen Universität Dresden|''Botanischer Garten Dresden'']] is a [[botanical garden]] in the ''[[Großer Garten]]'' that is maintained by the [[Dresden University of Technology]]. Also located in the ''Großer Garten'' is the [[Dresden Zoo]].

===Architecture===
Although Dresden is often said to be a Baroque city, its architecture is influenced by more than one style. Other eras of importance are the [[Renaissance]] and [[Historism]], as well as the contemporary styles of [[Modernism]] and [[Postmodernism]].

Dresden has some 13&amp;nbsp;000 listed cultural monuments and eight districts under general preservation orders.&lt;ref&gt;Dresden: [http://www.dresden.de/en/05/040_Monument_preservation.php Monument preservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Royal household====
[[File:Dresden-Zwinger.courtyard.04.JPG|thumb|[[Zwinger|Zwinger Palace]]]]
The royal buildings are among the most impressive buildings in Dresden. The [[Dresden Castle]] was the seat of the [[Royal Household|royal household]] from 1485. The wings of the building have been renewed, built upon and restored many times. Due to this integration of styles, the castle is made up of elements of the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Classicism|Classicist]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/residenzschloss/geschichte.html The History of  the Royal Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zwinger]] Palace is across the road from the castle. It was built on the old stronghold of the city and was converted to a centre for the royal art collections and a place to hold festivals. Its gate by the moat, surmounted by a golden crown, is famous.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/zwinger_mit_semperbau/geschichte.html History of the Zwinger and Semperbau]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other royal buildings and ensembles:
* [[Brühl's Terrace]] was a gift to [[Heinrich, count von Brühl]], and became an ensemble of buildings above the river Elbe.
* [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] with the [[Pillnitz Castle]] and other castles

====Sacred buildings====
The [[Katholische Hofkirche|Hofkirche]] was the church of the royal household. Augustus the Strong, who desired to be [[King of Poland]], converted to Catholicism, as Polish kings had to be Catholic. At that time Dresden was strictly Protestant. Augustus the Strong ordered the building of the Hofkirche, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, to establish a sign of Roman Catholic religious importance in Dresden. The church is the cathedral &quot;Sanctissimae Trinitatis&quot; since 1980. The  crypt of the [[Wettin (dynasty)|Wettin Dynasty]] is located within the church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen]]: [http://www.bistum-dresden-meissen.de/32/40/43/index.php Kathedrale Ss. Trinitatis in Dresden]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the Hofkirche, the Lutheran [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] was built almost contemporaneously by the citizens of Dresden. It is said to be the greatest cupola building in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Northern Europe. The city's historic Kreuzkirche was reconsecrated in 1388.&lt;ref&gt;Evangelisch-Lutherische Kreuzkirchgemeinde Dresden: [http://www.dresdner-kreuzkirche.de/index_e.html History of the Church of the Holy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other churches in Dresden, for example a [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in the Südvorstadt district.

====Contemporary architecture====
[[File:Dresden-Kristallpalast-nigh.jpg|thumb|The locally controversial UFA-Palast]]
Dresden has been an important site for the development of [[contemporary architecture]] for centuries, and this trend has continued into the 20th and 21st centuries.

[[Historicism (art)|Historicist]] buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s sampled by public buildings such as the [[Sächsische Staatskanzlei|Staatskanzlei]] or the [[Dresden City Hall|City Hall]]. One of the youngest buildings of that era is the Hygiene Museum, which is designed in an impressively monumental style, but employs plain façades and simple structures. It is often attributed, wrongly, to the [[Bauhaus]] school.

Most of the present cityscape of Dresden was built after 1945, a mix of reconstructed or repaired old buildings and new buildings in the modern and postmodern styles. Important buildings erected between 1945 and 1990 are the Centrum-Warenhaus (a large [[department store]]) representing the [[international style (architecture)|international style]], the Kulturpalast, and several smaller and two bigger complexes of [[Plattenbau]] housing in [[Gorbitz]], while there is also housing dating from the era of [[Stalinist architecture]].
[[File:Dresden synagoge 03.jpg|thumb|The New Synagogue|left]]

After 1990 and German reunification, new styles emerged. Important contemporary buildings include the [[New Synagogue (Dresden)|New Synagogue]], a [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] building with few windows, the [[Transparent Factory]], the Saxon State Parliament and the New Terrace, the UFA-Kristallpalast cinema by [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]] (one of the biggest buildings of [[Deconstructivism]] in Germany), and the [[Saxon State Library]]. [[Daniel Libeskind]] and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] both modified existing buildings. Foster roofed the main railway station with translucent Teflon-coated synthetics. Libeskind changed the whole structure of the [[Bundeswehr Military History Museum]] Museum by placing a wedge through the historical arsenal building.

====Other buildings====
[[File:Goldener Reiter Dresden Germany.JPG|thumb|The golden equestrian sculpture of King/Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|August the Strong]]]]
Other buildings include important bridges crossing the [[Elbe]] river, the [[Blaues Wunder]] bridge and the [[Augustusbrücke]], which is on the site of the oldest bridge in Dresden.

There are about 300 fountains and springs, many of them in parks or squares. The wells serve only a decorative function, since there is a [[fresh water]] system in Dresden. Springs and fountains are also elements in contemporary cityspaces.

The most famous sculpture in Dresden is [[Jean-Joseph Vinache]]'s  golden [[equestrian sculpture]] of August the Strong called the ''Goldener Reiter'' (Golden Cavalier) on the Neustädter Markt square. It shows August at the beginning of the Hauptstraße (Main street) on his way to Warsaw, where he was King of Poland in personal union. Another sculpture is the memorial of [[Martin Luther]] in front of the Frauenkirche.

====Dresden-Hellerau—Germany's first garden city====
The [[garden city movement|Garden City]] of [[Hellerau]], at that time a suburb of Dresden, was founded in 1909. In 1911 [[Heinrich Tessenow]] built the Hellerau [[Festspielhaus Hellerau|Festspielhaus]] (festival theatre) and Hellerau became a centre of modernism with international standing until the outbreak of World War I.

In 1950, Hellerau was incorporated into the city of Dresden. Today the Hellerau reform architecture is recognised as exemplary. In the 1990s, the garden city of Hellerau became a [[conservation area]].

====Living quarters====
Dresden's urban parts are subdivided in rather a lot of city quarters, up to around 100, among them relatively many larger villa quarters dominated by historic multiple dwelling units, especially, but not only along the river, most known are [[Blasewitz]], [[Loschwitz]] and [[Pillnitz]]. Also some Art Nouveau living quarters and two bigger quarters typical for communist architecture&amp;nbsp;– but much renovated&amp;nbsp;– can be found. The villa town of [[Radebeul]] joins the Dresden city tram system, which is expansive due to the lack of an underground system.

===Cinemas and cinematics===
There are several small cinemas presenting [[cult film]]s and low-budget or low-profile films chosen for their cultural value. Dresden also has a few multiplex cinemas, of which the Rundkino is the oldest.

Dresden has been a centre for the production of animated films and optical [[cinematic techniques]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Sport===
[[File:Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Glücksgas Stadium]], the current home of Dynamo Dresden]]
Dresden is home to [[Dynamo Dresden]], which had a tradition in [[European Cup and Champions League history|UEFA club competitions]] up to the early 1990s. Dynamo Dresden won eight titles in the [[DDR-Oberliga]]. Currently, the club is member of the [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga]] after some seasons in the [[Fußball-Bundesliga]] and [[3rd Liga 2008-09|3rd Liga]].

In the early 20th century, the city was represented by [[Dresdner SC]], who were one of Germany's most successful clubs in football. Their best days were during World War II, when they were twice German [[German football champions|Champions]], and twice [[DFB Pokal|Cup]] winners. Dresdner SC is a multisport club. While its [[football team]] plays in the sixth-tier [[Landesliga Sachsen]], its volleyball section has a team in the women's [[Bundesliga (volleyball)|Bundesliga]]. Dresden has a third [[association football|football]] [[team]] [[SC Borea Dresden]].
[[Dresdner Eislöwen|ESC Dresdner Eislöwen]] is an [[ice hockey]] club playing in the [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2nd Bundesliga]] again. [[Dresden Monarchs]] are an [[American football]] team in the [[German Football League]].

Since 1890 also horse races are happened and the [http://www.dresdener-rennverein.de/ Dresdener Rennverein 1890 e.V.] are active and one of the big sport events in Dresden.

Major sport facilities in Dresden are the [[Glücksgas Stadium]], the [[Heinz-Steyer-Stadion]] and the [[EnergieVerbund Arena]] (ice hockey).

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
{{Main|Transportation in Dresden}}
[[File:NGTD12DD front.jpg|thumb|The longest trams in Dresden set a record in length]]

The [[Bundesautobahn 4]] ([[European route E40]]) crosses Dresden in the northwest from west to east. The [[Bundesautobahn 17]] leaves the A4 in a south-eastern direction. In Dresden it begins to cross the Ore Mountains towards Prague. The [[Bundesautobahn 13]] leaves from the three-point interchange &quot;Dresden-Nord&quot; and goes to Berlin. The A13 and the A17 are on the [[European route E55]]. Several [[Bundesstraße]] roads crossing or running through Dresden.

There are two main inter-city transit hubs in the railway network in Dresden: [[Dresden Hauptbahnhof]] and [[Dresden-Neustadt railway station]]. The most important railway lines run to Berlin, Prague, Leipzig and Chemnitz. A [[Regional rail|commuter train]] system ([[Dresden S-Bahn]]) operates on three lines alongside the long-distance routes.

[[Dresden Airport]] is the [[international airport]] of Dresden, located at the north-western outskirts of the town. Its infrastructure has been improved with new terminals and a motorway access route.

[[File:VW-Cargotram-Dresden.jpg|thumb|left|CarGoTram]]
Dresden has a large tramway network operated by [[Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe]], the municipal transport company. Because the geological bedrock does not allow the building of [[Rapid transit|underground railways]], the tramway is an important form of public transport. The Transport Authority operates twelve lines on a 200&amp;nbsp;km network.&lt;ref&gt;Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080128233503/http://dvb.de/untnehm/unnehm.htm Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new [[low floor|low-floor]] vehicles are up to 45 metres long and produced by [[Bombardier Transportation]] in [[Bautzen]]. While many of the system's lines are on [[reserved track]] (often sown with grass to avoid noise), many tracks still run on the streets, especially in the inner city.

The [[CarGoTram]] is a tram that supplies Volkswagen's [[Transparent Factory]], crossing the city. The transparent factory is located not far from the city centre next to the city's largest park.&lt;ref&gt;Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe: [http://web.archive.org/web/20071216101751/http://www.dvb.de/untnehm/gbahn.htm CarGoTram]&lt;/ref&gt;

The districts of Loschwitz and Weisser Hirsch are connected by the [[Dresden Funicular Railway]], which was opened on 26 October 1895.

===Public utilities===
[[File:TySaechsischeStaatskanzlei20050921i0633.jpg|thumb|The [[Sächsische Staatskanzlei]] (''Saxon State Office'') is an institution assisting the President of the State]]
Dresden is the capital of a German ''[[States of Germany|Land]]'' (federal state). It is home to the [[Landtag of Saxony]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/start_eng.asp Sächsischer Landtag]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ministries of the Saxon Government. The controlling [[List of constitutional courts|Constitutional Court]] of Saxony is in Leipzig. The highest Saxon court in civil and [[criminal law]], the Higher Regional Court of Saxony, has its home in Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080102044810/http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/olg/content/47.htm Oberlandesgericht Dresden]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Saxon state authorities are located in Dresden. Dresden is home to the Regional Commission of the [[Dresden (region)|Dresden Regierungsbezirk]], which is a controlling authority for the Saxon Government. It has jurisdiction over eight [[List of rural districts of Germany|rural districts]], two [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]] and the city of Dresden.

Like many cities in Germany, Dresden is also home to a local court, has a trade corporation and a Chamber of Industry and Trade and many subsidiaries of federal agencies (such as the Federal Labour Office or the [[Technisches Hilfswerk|Federal Agency for Technical Relief]]). It also hosts some subdepartments of the German Customs and the eastern Federal Waterways Directorate.

Dresden is also home to a military subdistrict command but no longer has large military units as it did in the past. Dresden is the traditional location for [[officer (armed forces)|army officer]] schooling in Germany, today carried out in the [[Offizierschule des Heeres]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Dresden}}
[[File:Luftbild AMD Dresden 2005.jpg|thumb|GLOBALFOUNDRIES Fab 1]]
[[File:Dresden Kongresszentrum 1.jpg|thumb|The International Congress Centre Dresden]]

In 1990 Dresden—an important industrial centre of the German Democratic Republic—had to struggle with the [[economic collapse]] of [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]] and the other export markets in Eastern Europe. The German Democratic Republic had been the richest [[eastern bloc]] country but was faced with competition from the Federal Republic of Germany after reunification. After 1990 a completely new [[legal system|law]] and currency system was introduced in the wake of the collapse of the German Democratic Republic and eastern Germany's infrastructure was largely rebuilt with funds from the Federal Republic of Germany. Dresden as a major urban centre has developed much faster and more consistently than most other regions in the former German Democratic Republic, but the city still faces many social and economic problems stemming from the collapse of the former system, including high unemployment levels. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Until famous enterprises like [[Dresdner Bank]] left Dresden in the communist era to avoid [[nationalisation]], Dresden was one of the most important German cities. The period of the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] until 1990 was characterised by low economic growth in comparison to western German cities. The enterprises and production sites broke down almost completely as they entered the [[social market economy]]. Since then the economy of Dresden has been recovering.

The [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] fluctuated between 13% and 15% within the first 20 years after Germany's unification and is still relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bundesagentur für Arbeit]]: [http://www.pub.arbeitsamt.de/hst/services/statistik/detail/q.html Data and time series of the German labour market]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Dresden has developed faster than the average for Eastern Germany and has raised its [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] to 31,100 euro, equal to the GDP per capita of some poor West German communities (the average of the 50 biggest cities is around 35,000 euro).&lt;ref&gt;[[Great Officer of State|State Office]] for Statistics of the Free State of Saxony: [https://www.statistik.sachsen.de/12/pressearchiv/archiv2006/pm11206.htm Regional GDPs of 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the presence of public administration centres, a high density of semi-public research institutes which settle freely within Germany and a successful extension of high technology sectors through the help of public funding, the proportion of highly qualified workers is again among the highest in Germany and also in Europe-wide criteria, though - as all eastern towns in Germany - Dresden has a traditional shortage of corporate headquarters. Dresden is regularly ranked among the best ten bigger cities in Germany to live in. In May 2012 the unemployment rate reached a new low of 8.9%.

[[File:Glaeserne Manufaktur Dresden.JPG|thumb|left|[[Transparent Factory]] owned by [[Volkswagen]]]]

===Enterprises===
Three major sectors dominate Dresden's economy:

The [[Silicon Saxony|semiconductor industry]] was built up in 1969. Major enterprises today are [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s spin-off [[GLOBALFOUNDRIES]], [[Infineon Technologies]], [[ZMDI]] and Toppan Photomasks. Their factories attract many suppliers of material and cleanroom technology enterprises to Dresden.

The pharmaceutical sector came up at the end of the 19th century. The Sächsisches Serumwerk Dresden (Saxon Serum Plant, Dresden), owned by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], is a world leader in [[vaccine]] production. Another traditional pharmaceuticals producer is Arzneimittelwerke Dresden (Pharmaceutical Works, Dresden).

A third traditional branch is that of mechanical and [[electrical engineering]]. Major employers are the [[Volkswagen]] [[Transparent Factory]], [[EADS]] [[EADS EFW|Elbe Flugzeugwerke]] (Elbe Aircraft Works), [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[The Linde Group|Linde-KCA-Dresden]].  Tourism is another sector of the economy enjoying high revenue and many employees. There are something like hundred bigger hotels in Dresden with many of them in the upscale range.

==Media==
The media sector is not particularly strong in Dresden. Recently it sometimes benefits from the new interface with informatics so that it can gain transregional meaning beyond the semi-public science and upper culture sectors which often produce their media coverage in-house. The media in Dresden include two major newspapers of regional record: the ''[[Sächsische Zeitung]]'' (''Saxonian Newspaper'', circulation around 300,000) and the ''[[Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten]]'' (''Dresden's Latest News'', circulation around 50,000). Dresden has a broadcasting centre belonging to the [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]]. The ''Dresdner Druck- und Verlagshaus'' (Dresden printing plant and publishing house) produces part of [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]'s [[print run]], among other newspapers and magazines.

[[File:Dresden-Frauenkirche-View.from.top.03.JPG|thumb|Hochschule für Bildende Künste Dresden]]

==Education and science==

===Universities===
Dresden is home to a number of renowned universities, but among German cities it is a more recent location for academic education.

*The [[Dresden University of Technology]] (Technische Universität Dresden) with more than 36,000 students (2011)&lt;ref&gt;[[Technische Universität Dresden]]: [http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/portrait/ Profile of the TU Dresden]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1828 and is among the oldest and largest [[University of Technology|Universities of Technology]] in Germany. It is currently the university of technology in Germany with the largest number of students but also has many courses in [[social studies]], economics and other non-technical sciences. It offers 126 courses. In 2006, the TU Dresden was successful in the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]] of the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]].
* The Dresden University of Technology founded a Kids-University in 2004.
* The [[Dresden University of Applied Sciences]] (Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Dresden) was founded in 1992 and had about 5,300 students in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Applied Sciences Dresden]]: [http://www.htw-dresden.de/oea/Presse/06_Imma.pdf press notice to the 2006 matriculation]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] (Hochschule für Bildende Künste Dresden) was founded in 1764 and is known for its former professors and artists such as [[George Grosz]], [[Sascha Schneider]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Bernardo Bellotto]], [[Carl-Gustav Carus]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[Gerhard Richter]].
* The [[Palucca School of Dance]] was founded by [[Gret Palucca]] in 1935 and is a major European school of [[free dance]].
* The [[Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden|Carl Maria von Weber College of Music]] was founded in 1856.

Other universities include the &quot;Hochschule für Kirchenmusik&quot;, a school specialising in [[Christian music|church music]], the &quot;Evangelische Hochschule für Sozialarbeit&quot;, an education institution for [[social work]]. The &quot;Dresden International University&quot; is a private postgraduate university, founded a few years ago in cooperation with the Dresden University of Technology.
[[File:Dresden-WTC-night.jpg|thumb|Dresden World Trade Centre at night]]

===Research institutes===
Dresden also hosts many [[research institute]]s, some of which have gained an international standing. The domains of most importance are micro- and nanoelectronics, transport and infrastructure systems, material and photonic technology, and bio-engineering. The institutes are well connected among one other as well as with the academic education institutions.

[[Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf]] is the largest complex of research facilities in Dresden, a short distance outside the urban areas. It still focuses on [[nuclear medicine]] and physics.

{{Audio|Flein.ogg|'''Flein'''}} is a municipality in the district of [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]] in southern [[Germany]].

== Geography ==
Flein is situated in the south of the district of Heilbronn and directly borders on [[Heilbronn]] in the south.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
Neighbouring towns and municipalities of Flein are (clockwise from north-west): ''[[Heilbronn]]'' ([[Independent city|Stadtkreis]]), [[Untergruppenbach]] and [[Talheim, Neckar|Talheim]] (both in the district of Heilbronn). Flein has combined with Talheim to form a joint association of administrations.

== History ==
[[Image:Flein-altes-rathaus2.JPG|thumb|left|Old town hall]]
The communal land of Flein already was settled during the [[linear pottery culture]] of the [[neolithic]]. The village was first mentioned in 1188 within an imperial document as ''Flina''. The name presumably comes from the [[Old High German]] term ''flins'' respectively the [[Middle High German]] ''vlins'', meaning something like &quot;pebble&quot; or &quot;hard stone&quot;.

In 1385 the free imperial city [[Heilbronn]] bought the village from the ''Lords of Sturmfeder''. During the [[German Peasants' War]] many insurgent farmers of the region assembled in Flein around of their head Jäcklein Rohrbach. Like most of Germany, Flein suffered great damage during the 
[[Thirty Years' War]].

In 1802 Flein became part of [[Württemberg]]. The enormous increase of population after World War II is due to the settlement of many refugees and creation of building land a few years later. In the 1970s the population of Flein voted against an incorporation to Heilbronn and for combining a joint association of administrations with Talheim.

=== Religions ===
Apart from an own Protestant parish there's a Catholic one together with Talheim (Catholic Parish Flein-Talheim). The Protestant parish consists of 3,400 members.

=== Development of population ===
*1648: 250
*1800: 800
*1900: 1,600
*2005: 6,535 &lt;!-- Source: Statistisches Landesamt B-W. --&gt;

== Politics ==
=== District council ===
Following the municipal election of 13 June 2004, the district council of Flein has 18 seats. The election result is as follows:
{| border=0
|- bgcolor=#FFFFFF
|- bgcolor=#CCDDEE
|- bgcolor=#CCDDEE
|party||amount||+/-||seats||+/-
|- bgcolor=#DDEEFF
|''FW Flein'' ||align=right | 37.3%||align=right | (−12.2)||align=right | 7||align=right | (−2)

|- bgcolor=#CCDDEE
|}

The mayor is also a member of the district council and its chairman.

=== Mayor ===
On June 24, 2007, there were mayoral elections; the incumbent, Jürgen Schmid did not stand for re-election after 16 years in office. Since there was no absolute majority after the first election a run off was necessary. On July 15, 2007. Alexander Krüger was elected as mayor for an eight year term with 63.9% of the votes. He started on August 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Friedrich: ''Schmid im Ruhestand, Krüger im Amt''. In: ''Heilbronner Stimme'' from August 17, 2007, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arms and flag ===
The theme of the municipal coat of arms is the martyrdom of [[Saint Vitus]], derived from a picture in the town's St. Vitus Church (see gallery below). The arms depict a golden cauldron on red flames with a blue background, inside which is the bare, praying Saint Vitus. The municipal flag is yellow and blue.

The holy [[Vitus]] is the [[patron saint]] of Flein. In Flein there's the oldest portrayal of his torture, presumably an old seal. The second oldest one is on a stone of 1699. In a description holy Vitus is named in 1865. In a municipal seal it's attested no earlier than 1903. However, since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] no Saints' icons were inserted in the arms, which means that the arms are in fact much older, dating to around 1500 or earlier, making them one of the oldest of the whole district.

The colours of the arms were laid down in 1938 by the archive direction of Württemberg. In the same year the Nazi [[NSDAP]] party Heilbronn suggested to accept another arms without a religious meaning. The archive direction suggested a blazon containing an arms ''In a split sign in blue a head of a lion, behind in gold a blue grape with two vine leafs''. However, in June 1939 the NSDAP stated that it was of minor importance and not to hurry the change. So Flein remained with its previous arms and confirmed this decision in 1956. This decision was confirmed on January 11, 1957, by the ministry of the interior of Baden-Württemberg. In the same year local artist Hans Epple created a drawing used by the municipality today (see illustration).&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Bardua: ''Die Kreis- und Gemeindewappen im Regierungsbezirk Stuttgart''. Theiss, Stuttgart 1987, ISBN 3-8062-0801-8 (Kreis- und Gemeindewappen in Baden-Württemberg, 1). p. 64&lt;br /&gt;Eberhard Gönner: ''Wappenbuch des Stadt- und des Landkreises Heilbronn mit einer Territorialgeschichte dieses Raumes''. archive direction Stuttgart, Stuttgart 1965 (Veröffentlichungen der Staatlichen Archivverwaltung Baden-Württemberg, 9). p. 78&lt;br /&gt;Ernst Clement: ''Das Wappen der Gemeinde Flein''. In: Peter Wanner (Hrsg.): ''Flein, Flein, du edler Fleck''. Gemeinde Flein, Flein 1988. p. 13f.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this period San Francisco built some of its most important infrastructure projects.  Civil Engineer [[Michael O'Shaughnessy]] was hired by San Francisco Mayor [[James Rolph]] as chief engineer for the city in September 1912 to supervised the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir, the [[Stockton Street Tunnel]], the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]], the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]], a high-pressure fire system, and new sewers. San Francisco's streetcar system, of which the J, K, L, M, and N lines survive today, was pushed to completion by O'Shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927.  It was the [[O'Shaughnessy Dam]], [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]], and [[Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct]] that would have the largest impact on San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco - M.M.

It was in this period that the island of [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], a former military stockade, began its service as a federal maximum security prison, housing notorious inmates such as [[Al Capone]], and [[Robert Franklin Stroud]], The Birdman of Alcatraz.

[[File:SanFranciscoFromTheISS(Cropped).jpg|right|upright|thumb|The San Francisco Peninsula]]

San Francisco is located on the [[West Coast of the United States]] at the north end of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and [[San Francisco Bay]] within its boundaries. Several [[islands of San Francisco Bay|islands]]—[[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]] and the adjacent [[Yerba Buena Island]], and small portions of [[Alameda, California|Alameda Island]], [[Red Rock Island]], and [[Angel Island, California|Angel Island]]&lt;!--Alameda island is capitalized correctly; &quot;island&quot; is not part of the proper noun and is uses here to distinguish the island from the municipality, which also includes of Bay Farm Island, Balena Bay, Coast Guard Island, etc. --&gt;—are part of the city. Also included are the uninhabited [[Farallon Islands]], {{convert|27|mi|km}} offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a &quot;seven-by-seven-mile square,&quot; a common local colloquialism referring to the city's shape, though its total area, including water, is nearly {{convert|232|sqmi|km2}}.

The nearby [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas]] and [[Hayward Fault]]s are responsible for much earthquake activity, although neither physically passes through the city itself. The San Andreas Fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989. Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis. The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city's infrastructure development.

San Francisco's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits. Entire neighborhoods such as the [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina]], [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]], and [[Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunters Point]], as well as large sections of the [[The Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]], sit on areas of [[Landfill#Land reclamation|landfill]].

Also in this quadrant are [[Russian Hill, San Francisco|Russian Hill]], a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]]; [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], the city's [[Little Italy]] and the former center of the [[Beat Generation]]; and [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], which features [[Coit Tower]].

Further development is taking place just to the south in [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]], a former railyard now anchored by a second campus of the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. 

West of downtown, across [[Van Ness Avenue (San Francisco)|Van Ness Avenue]], lies the large [[Western Addition, San Francisco|Western Addition]] neighborhood, which became established with a large African American population after [[World War II]]. The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including [[Hayes Valley, San Francisco, California|Hayes Valley]], [[Fillmore District, San Francisco, California|the Fillmore]], and [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]], which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its [[Japanese American]] residents were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly removed and interned]] during World War II. The Western Addition survived the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] with its [[Victorian house|Victorians]] largely intact, including the famous &quot;[[Painted Ladies]]&quot;, standing alongside [[Alamo Square]].

In the 1910s, a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and, in the 1950s, immigrants from [[Mexican American|Mexico]] began to predominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.qualityoflife-themovie.com/website/mission.html | title=Quality of Life (film website) | work=Mission District History | author=Morgan, Benjamin (Director) | year=2007 | accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino, to [[Twentysomething (term)|twenty-something]] professionals living the [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] lifestyle. [[Noe Valley, San Francisco|Noe Valley]] to the southwest and [[Bernal Heights, San Francisco|Bernal Heights]] to the south are both increasingly popular among young families with children. East of the Mission is the [[Potrero Hill]] neighborhood, a mostly residential neighborhood that features sweeping views of downtown San Francisco. West of the Mission, the area historically known as [[Eureka Valley (San Francisco)|Eureka Valley]], now popularly called [[The Castro, San Francisco|the Castro]], was once a working-class Scandinavian and Irish area. It has become North America's first and best known [[gay village]], and is now the center of [[homosexuality|gay]] life in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Castro | work=SFGate San Francisco Neighborhood Guide | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/neighborhoods/sf/castro/ | accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located near the city's southern border, the [[Excelsior District, San Francisco|Excelsior District]] is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco. The predominately African American [[Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview-Hunters Point]] in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods and suffers from a high rate of crime, though the area has been the focus of controversial plans for [[urban renewal]].

The construction of the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]] in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar, hastening the development of [[West Portal, San Francisco|West Portal]], and nearby affluent [[Forest Hill, San Francisco|Forest Hill]] and [[St. Francis Wood, San Francisco|St. Francis Wood]]. Further west, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to [[Golden Gate Park]] lies the vast [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]], a large middle class area with a predominantly Asian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The northwestern quadrant of the city contains the [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond]], also a mostly middle-class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park, home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many [[Russian people|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] immigrants. Together, these areas are known as [[Neighborhoods in San Francisco|The Avenues]]. These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions: the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions.

Because of its unique city-county status, local government exercises jurisdiction over property that would otherwise be located outside of its corporation limit. [[San Francisco International Airport]], though located in [[San Mateo County]], is owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco.

The non profit City Carshare opened in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City CarShare Out Mission|url=https://www.citycarshare.org/why-city-car-share/our-mission/|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zipcar Our Mission|url=http://www.zipcar.com/about|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Zipcar]] closely followed.

[[Bike sharing]] is planned for launch in August 2013 for San Francisco.  The [[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency]] and [[Bay Area Air Quality Management District]] plan to start a 500 bike system in the downtown SF core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SFMTA - Bikesharing|url=http://www.sfmta.com/cms/bshare/indxbishare.htm|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located across the bay, [[Oakland International Airport]] is a popular, low-cost alternative to SFO. Geographically, Oakland Airport is approximately the same distance from downtown San Francisco as SFO, but due to its location across [[San Francisco Bay]], it is greater driving distance from San Francisco.

===Seaports===
{{Main|Port of San Francisco}}
[[File:FerryBuildingEmbarcaderoBayBridge.JPG|thumb|right|The [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]] along the [[The Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]]]

The [[Port of San Francisco]] was once the largest and busiest seaport on the West Coast. It featured rows of [[piers]] perpendicular to the shore, where cargo from the moored ships was handled by cranes and manual labor and transported to nearby warehouses. The port handled cargo to and from trans-Pacific and Atlantic destinations, and was the West Coast center of the [[West coast lumber trade|lumber trade]]. The [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike]], an important episode in the history of the [[Labor unions in the United States|American labor movement]], brought most ports to a standstill. The advent of [[container shipping]] made pier-based ports obsolete, and most commercial berths moved to the [[Port of Oakland]] and [[Port of Richmond (California)|Port of Richmond]]. A few active berths specializing in [[break bulk cargo]] remain alongside the [[Islais Creek]] Channel.

Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]], while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace. The port's other activities now focus on developing waterside assets to support recreation and tourism.

The port currently uses Pier 35 to handle the 60-80 [[cruise ship]] calls and 200,000 passengers that come to San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SFPort - Cruises|url=http://www.sfport.com/index.aspx?page=157|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Itineraries from San Francisco usually include round trip cruises to Alaska and Mexico.  The new James R. Herman Cruise Terminal Project at Pier 27 is scheduled to open 2014 as a replacement.   The existing primary terminal at Pier 35 has neither the sufficient capacity to allow for the increasing length and passenger capacity of new cruise ships nor the amenities needed for an international cruise terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SFPort - James R. Herman Cruise Terminal Project at Pier 27|url=http://www.sfport.com/index.aspx?page=282|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2013, [[Princess Cruises]] [[Grand Princess| '' Grand Princess '' ]] became the first ship to home port in San Francisco year round. The ship offers cruises to Alaska, California Coasts, Hawaii, and Mexico.'' Grand Princess '' will be stationed in San Francisco until April 2014. Princess will also operate other ships during the summer of 2014, making it the only cruise line home porting year round in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LA Times - Cruises: The Grand Princess finds a home in San Francisco|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-trb-cruises-grand-princess-san-francisco-20130412,0,934694.story|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisco&quot;&gt;Though many residents still maintain that the nickname &quot;Frisco&quot; is taboo, many residents, especially younger and working-class natives, have kept this term alive and well. In any case, this is a matter of ongoing speculation that reflects certain cultural divisions within the city. {{cite news

&lt;ref name=&quot;Friscophobia&quot;&gt;Some tourists refer to San Francisco as &quot;Frisco.&quot; However, locals discourage this. Samuel D. Cohen writes that many credit &quot;Friscophobia&quot; to newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], whose first book, published in 1953, was &quot;Don't Call it Frisco&quot; after a 1918 newspaper article of the same name. Caen was considered by many to be the recognized authority on what was, and what was not, beneath the city's dignity, and to him, Frisco was intolerable. {{cite web

===Early history===

In the [[Pre-Columbian era|precolonial era]], the area of present day New York City was inhabited by various bands of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], including the [[Lenape]], whose homeland, known as [[Lenapehoking]], included Staten Island, the western portion of [[Long Island]] (including the area that would become Brooklyn and Queens), Manhattan, and the [[Lower Hudson Valley]], including The Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;Evan T. Pritchard: Native New Yorkers: the legacy of the Algonquin people of New York, p.27 (2002);ISBN 1-57178-107-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented visit by a European was in 1524 by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer in the service of the [[French crown]], who sailed his ship ''[[La Dauphine]]'' into [[New York Harbor]]. He claimed the area for France and named it &quot;Nouvelle Angoulême&quot; ([[New Angoulême]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;rodgers&quot;&gt;{{cite quick |book|title=New York: The World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress |author=Rankin, Rebecca B., Cleveland Rodgers |publisher=Harper |year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January a year later, [[Estêvão Gomes]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailing for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] of Spain, entered New York Harbor and charted the mouth of the Hudson river which he named ''Rio de San Antonio''. Heavy ice kept him from further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Wpa Writer's Project:A Maritime History of New York, p.246;Going Coastal Productions (2004) ISBN 0-9729803-1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1609, [[English people|English]] explorer [[Henry Hudson]] re-discovered the region when he sailed his ship the ''[[Halve Maen]]'' (&quot;Half Moon&quot; in Dutch) into New York Harbor while searching for the [[Northwest Passage]] to the [[Orient]] for his employer the [[Dutch East India Company]]. He proceeded to sail up what he named the ''[[Hudson River|North River]],'' also called the ''Mauritis River'', and now known as the [[Hudson River]], to the site of the present-day New York State capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in the belief that it might represent an oceanic [[tributary]]. When the river narrowed and was no longer [[saline water|saline]], he realized it wasn't a sea passage and sailed back downriver. He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for his employer. In 1614 the area between [[Cape Cod]] and [[Delaware Bay]] would be claimed by the [[Netherlands]] and called ''Nieuw-Nederland'' ([[New Netherland]]).

A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 with the founding of a Dutch [[fur trade|fur trading]] settlement on Governors Island. In 1625 construction was started on a citadel and a [[Fort Amsterdam (New Amsterdam)|Fort Amsterdam]] on Manhattan Island, later called New Amsterdam (''Nieuw Amsterdam'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/kingston/colonization.htm Dutch Colonies], [[National Park Service]].

In 1664, [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the [[Director-General of New Amsterdam|Director-General]] of the [[colony]] of [[New Netherland]], surrendered New Amsterdam to the English without bloodshed. The English promptly renamed the fledgling city &quot;New York&quot; after the [[James II of England|English Duke of York and Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book|title=The Historical Atlas of New York City: A Visual Celebration of 400 Years of New York City's History|author=Homberger, Eric|year=2005|page=34|publisher=Owl Books|isbn=0-8050-7842-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the English gained New Amsterdam (New York) in North America in exchange for Dutch control of [[Run (island)|Run]], an [[Indonesia]]n island. Several intertribal wars among the Native Americans and some [[epidemic]]s brought on by contact with the Europeans caused sizable population losses for the Lenape between the years 1660 and 1670.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.penntreatymuseum.org/americans.php Native Americans]&quot;.

In 1702, the city lost 10% of its population to [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/fever/timeline/index.html Timeline of Yellow Fever in America]&quot;.

New York grew in importance as a trading port while under [[British Empire|British rule]]. It became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, more than any other city other than [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor.  Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the South. Discovery of the [[African Burying Ground]] in the 1990s during construction of a new federal courthouse near [[Foley Square]] revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.

The city hosted the influential [[John Peter Zenger]] trial in 1735, helping to establish the [[freedom of the press]] in North America. In 1754, [[Columbia University]] was founded under charter by [[George II of Great Britain]] as King's College in Lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book|title=An Historical Sketch of Columbia College, in the City of New York, 1754–1876 |author=Moore, Nathaniel Fish |year=1876 |page=8 |publisher=Columbia College}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in New York in October 1765 as the [[Sons of Liberty]] organized in the city, skirmishing over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.

The [[Battle of Long Island]], the largest battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]], was fought in August 1776 entirely within the modern day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, leaving subsequent smaller [[Engagement (military)|armed engagements]] following in its wake, the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] refugees, as well as escaped slaves who joined the British lines for the freedom promised by the Crown. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuated]] in 1783, they transported 3,000 [[freedmen]] for resettlement in [[Nova Scotia]]. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean.

The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the [[Conference House]] on Staten Island between American [[delegate]]s including [[Benjamin Franklin]], and British general [[Lord Howe]] on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began the [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|Great Fire of New York]] occurred, a large conflagration which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinity Church bicentennial celebration, May 5, 1897 By Trinity Church (New York, N.Y.) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785, the assembly of the [[Congress of the Confederation]] made New York the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last capital of the U.S. under the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the first capital under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]]. In 1789 the first President of the United States, [[George Washington]], was inaugurated; the first [[United States Congress]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] each assembled for the first time, and the [[United States Bill of Rights]] was drafted, all at [[Federal Hall]] on Wall Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|title=The People's Vote: President George Washington's First Inaugural Speech (1789) |publisher=U.S. News and World Report |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page11.htm |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1790, New York had surpassed [[Philadelphia]] as the largest city in the United States.

Under New York State's &quot;Gradual [[Abolition of slavery in the USA|Abolition]] law of 1799&quot;, children of slave mothers were born to be eventually liberated but were held in [[indentured servitude]] until their mid-to-late twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.slavenorth.com/nyemancip.htm|title=http://www.slavenorth.com/nyemancip.htm|title=Slavery in the North - Emancipation in New York|author=Douglas Harper|year=2003|accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, gradually a significant free-black population developed in Manhattan. Under such influential [[Founding Fathers of the United States|United States founders]] as [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[John Jay]] the [[New York Manumission Society]] worked for abolition and established the [[African Free School]] to educate black children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided&quot;&gt;[http://www.nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/ ''New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War'' online exhibit], New-York Historical Society, (November 17, 2006 to September 3, 2007, physical exhibit), accessed 2012-05-10&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School. The city's black population reached more than 16,000 in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.emory.edu/newsletter01/newsl01/african.htm Leslie M. Harris, &quot;African Americans in New York City, 1626–1863&quot;], Department of History, Emory University&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the city was transformed by development relating to its status as a trading center, as well as by European [[immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;Ira Rosenwaike (1972).[http://books.google.com/books?id=2OR2yeASrfIC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Population History of New York City''], p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; The city adopted the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], which expanded the city [[Grid plan#Early United States|street grid]] to encompass all of Manhattan.  The 1819 opening of the [[Erie Canal]] through central New York connected the Atlantic port to the agricultural markets and commodities of the North American interior via the [[Hudson River]] and the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;

Several prominent American literary figures lived in New York during the 1830s and 1840s, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], [[John Keese]], [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Public-minded members of the old merchant elite lobbied for the establishment of [[Central Park]], which in 1857 became the first landscaped park in an American city.

The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, and by 1860, one in four New Yorkers—over 200,000—had been born in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualny.cuny.edu/cholera/1866/cholera_1866_set.html &quot;Cholera in Nineteenth Century New York&quot;].

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861 Mayor [[Fernando Wood]] called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided&quot;/&gt; Anger at new military conscription laws during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) led to the [[New York Draft Riots|Draft Riots of 1863]], led by ethnic Irish working class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divided&quot;/&gt;

The situation deteriorated into attacks on black New Yorkers and their property, following fierce competition for a decade between immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but its more than 200 children escaped harm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; Rioters killed an estimated 100 blacks and attacked many more, especially in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then a separate city), the County of New York (which then included parts of the Bronx), the County of Richmond, and the western portion of the County of Queens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071011221627/http://nyc.gov/html/nyc100/html/classroom/hist_info/100aniv.html The 100 Year Anniversary of the Consolidation of the 5 Boroughs into New York City], New York City.

In 1904, the steamship ''[[PS General Slocum|General Slocum]]'' caught fire in the East River, killing 1,021 people on board.

In 1911, the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]], the city's worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and major improvements in factory safety standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell1&quot;&gt;

By 1916, New York City was home to the largest urban African diaspora in North America. The [[Harlem Renaissance]] of literary and cultural life flourished during the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].  The larger economic boom generated construction of competing skyscrapers that changed the skyline into its identifiable twentieth-century shape.

New York became the most populous urbanized area in the world in early 1920s, overtaking [[London]].  The metropolitan area surpassed the 10 million mark in early 1930s, becoming the first [[megacity]] in human history.&lt;ref&gt;

Returning [[World War II]] veterans created a postwar economic boom and the development of large housing tracts in eastern Queens. New York emerged from the war unscathed as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading America's place as the world's dominant economic power. The [[United Nations Headquarters]] (completed in 1950) emphasized New York's political influence, and the rise of [[abstract expressionism]] in the city precipitated New York's displacement of [[Paris]] as the center of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;

New York City is located in the [[Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)|Northeastern United States]], in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington, DC is {{convert|228|mi|km}} driving distance from New York, and Boston is {{convert|217|mi|km}} driving distance from New York.&amp;nbsp;– [http://maps.google.com/ Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt; The location at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]], which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], has helped the city grow in significance as a trading [[port]]. Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and [[Long Island]], making land scarce and encouraging a high population density.

The Hudson River flows through the [[Hudson Valley]] into [[New York Bay]]. Between New York City and [[Troy, New York]], the river is an [[estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/marinebio/fc.1.estuaries.html |title=Information About the Hudson River Estuary |publisher=Life.bio.sunysb.edu |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hudson separates the city from [[New Jersey]]. The [[East River]]—a tidal strait—flows from [[Long Island Sound]] and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long Island. The [[Harlem River]], another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates most of Manhattan from the Bronx. The [[Bronx River]], which flows through the Bronx and [[Westchester County]], is the only entirely [[fresh water]] river in the city.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;

The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable [[land reclamation]] along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times.

Winters are cold and damp, and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities located at similar or lesser latitudes such as [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cincinnati]], and [[Indianapolis]].

New York City is composed of five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book|title=Regionalism and realism: A Study of Government in the New York Metropolitan Area |author=Benjamin, Gerald, Richard P. Nathan |year=1990 |publisher=[[Brookings Institute]] |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each borough is coextensive with a respective [[county (United States)|county]] of [[New York|New York State]] as shown below.

Throughout the boroughs there are [[:Category:Neighborhoods in New York City|hundreds of distinct neighborhoods]], many with a definable history and character to call their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and The Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States.

*'''[[Manhattan]]''' (New York County) is the most densely populated borough and is home to [[Central Park]] and most of the city's skyscrapers. Most of the borough is on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]].  Manhattan is the financial center of the city and contains the headquarters of many major corporations, the UN, a number of important universities, and many cultural attractions. Manhattan is loosely divided into [[Lower Manhattan|Lower]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], and [[Upper Manhattan|Uptown]] regions. Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the [[Upper East Side]] and the [[Upper West Side]], and above the park is [[Harlem]]. New York City's remaining four boroughs are collectively referred to as the &quot;outer boroughs&quot;.

*'''[[The Bronx]]''' (Bronx County) is New York City's northernmost borough, the location of [[Yankee Stadium]], home of the [[New York Yankees]], and home to the largest [[housing cooperative|cooperatively owned housing]] complex in the United States, [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news|author=Frazier, Ian |title=Utopia, the Bronx |work=The New Yorker |date=June 26, 2006 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/26/060626fa_fact_frazier |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for a small section of Manhattan known as [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]], the Bronx is the only section of the city that is part of the United States' [[mainland United States|mainland]]. It is home to the [[Bronx Zoo]], the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States, which spans {{convert|265|acre|km2}} and is home to over 6,000 animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book|title=New York City Museum Guide |author=Ward, Candace |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2000 |isbn=0-486-41000-5 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronx is the birthplace of [[Rapping|rap]] and [[hip hop culture]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Toop-RapAttack2&quot;/&gt;

*'''[[Brooklyn]]''' (Kings County) on the western tip of [[Long Island]], is the city's most populous borough and was an independent city until 1898. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, social and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, [[List of Brooklyn neighborhoods|distinct neighborhoods]] and a distinctive architectural heritage. [[Downtown Brooklyn]] is the only central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough features a long beachfront shoreline including [[Coney Island]], established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book|title=Coney Island: The People's Playground |author=Immerso, Michael |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2002 |page=3 |isbn=0-8135-3138-1|accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is home to two of the three major airports serving the [[New York metropolitan area]], [[LaGuardia Airport]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. (The third is [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey.)

*'''[[Staten Island]]''' (Richmond County) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. Staten Island is connected to Brooklyn by the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] and to Manhattan by way of the free [[Staten Island Ferry]]. The Staten Island Ferry is one of the most popular tourist attractions in New York City as it provides unsurpassed views of the [[Statue of Liberty]], [[Ellis Island]], and lower Manhattan. Located in central Staten Island, the {{convert|2500|acres|km2|abbr=on}} [[Staten Island Greenbelt]] has some {{convert|28|mi|km}} of walking trails and one of the last undisturbed forests in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.nynjtc.org/park/staten-island-greenbelt |title=Staten Island Greenbelt &amp;#124; New York-New Jersey Trail Conference |publisher=Nynjtc.org |accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designated in 1984 to protect the island's natural lands, the Greenbelt comprises seven city parks.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of New York City}}
New York City's food culture includes a variety of world cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. [[Eastern Europe]]an and Italian immigrants have made the city famous for [[bagel]]s, [[Cheesecake#North America|cheesecake]] and [[New York-style pizza]], while [[Chinese restaurant|Chinese]] and other Asian restaurants, burger joints, Italian restaurants, diners and coffee shops are ubiquitous. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made [[Middle East]]ern foods such as [[falafel]]s and [[kebab]]s standbys of modern New York [[street food]], although hot dogs and pretzels are still the main street fare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news|title=Kebabs on the Night Shift |first=Jennifer |last=Bleyer |work=The New York Times |date=May 14, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/nyregion/thecity/14vend.html| accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also home to many of the finest and most diverse [[haute cuisine]] restaurants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news|title=Michelin Takes on the City, Giving Some a Bad Taste |first=Glenn |last=Collins |work=The New York Times |date=November 3, 2005 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D9163EF930A35752C1A9639C8B63 |accessdate=2006-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accent===
The New York area has a distinctive regional speech pattern called the [[New York dialect]], alternatively known as ''Brooklynese'' or ''New Yorkese''. It is generally considered one of the most recognizable accents within [[American English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book |last=Newman |first=Michael |year=2005 |chapter=New York Talk |title=American Voices |editor1-first=Walt |editor1-last=Wolfram |editor2-first=Ben |editor2-last=Ward |pages=82–87 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-2109-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and working-class people of [[European American|European]] descent, and the influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect.&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt;

The traditional New York area accent is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]], so that the sound {{IPA|[ɹ]}} does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as &quot;New Yawk.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt; There is no {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in words like ''park'' {{IPA|[pɑək]}} or {{IPA|[pɒək]}} (with vowel backed and [[vowel breaking|diphthongized]] due to the low-back chain shift), ''butter'' {{IPA|[bʌɾə]}}, or ''here'' {{IPA|[hiə]}}. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[ɔr]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]].

In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like &quot;girl&quot; and of words like &quot;oil&quot; become a diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced &quot;goil&quot; and ''oil'' is pronounced &quot;erl&quot;; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like &quot;Joizey&quot; (Jersey), &quot;Toidy-Toid Street&quot; (33rd St.) and &quot;terlet&quot; (toilet).&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt; The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' (played by [[Carroll O'Connor]]) was a good example of a speaker with this feature. This speech pattern is no longer prevalent.&lt;ref name=NYT19930214&gt;{{cite quick |news |last=Sontag |first=Deborah |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D61438F937A25751C0A965958260 |title=Oy Gevalt!

The government of New York is more centralized than that of most other U.S. cities. In New York City, the central government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.

[[File:NYC Subway R160A 9237 on the E.jpg|thumb|The [[New York City Subway]] is the world's largest [[rapid transit]] system by length of routes and by number of [[train station|stations]].]]
New York City is served by [[Amtrak]], which uses [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]]. Amtrak provides connections to [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] along the [[Northeast Corridor]] and long-distance train service to other [[North America]]n cities. The [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]], the main [[intercity bus]] terminal of the city, serves 7,000 buses and 200,000 commuters daily, making it the busiest bus station in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |press release|title=

The New York City Subway is the largest [[rapid transit]] system in the world when measured by stations in operation, with {{NYCS const|number|total}}, and by length of routes. It is the third-largest when measured by annual ridership (1.5&amp;nbsp;billion passenger trips in 2006).&lt;ref name=MTAinfo /&gt; New York's subway is also notable because nearly the entire system remains open 24 hours a day, in contrast to the overnight shutdown common to systems in most cities, including [[MTR|Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/getting_around/service_hours.html|title=Service Hours|publisher=MTR|accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/hongkong/transportation/metro-tsuenwan-line.htm|title=Tsuen Wan Line|publisher=TravelChinaGuide.com|accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London Underground|London]], [[Paris Métro|Paris]], [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.smrt.co.kr/program/Eng/Subway/Train/Station_select.jsp?main=Y|title=Train Time Table - Search station|publisher=[[Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation]]|accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.smrt.co.kr/program/cyberStation/main2.jsp?lang=e#|title=Subway map|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation|accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tokyo Subway|Tokyo]].

The city's complex and extensive transportation system also includes the longest [[suspension bridge]] in the [[Americas]] and one of the world's longest (the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge|Verrazano-Narrows]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease.com&quot;&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/toptens/worldsuspbridges.html|title=Longest Suspension Bridges in the World|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Verrazano-Narrows Bridge&quot;&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/verrazano-narrows/ |title=Verrazano-Narrows Bridge |publisher=Eastern Roads |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular [[Holland Tunnel|tunnel]],&lt;ref name = nhlsum&gt;{{cite quick |web | title =  Holland Tunnel | work = National Historic Landmark Quicklinks | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | url = http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2176&amp;ResourceType=Structure | accessdate =2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 12,000 [[Taxicabs of New York City|yellow cabs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/state_of_taxi.pdf |title=The State of the NYC Taxi |publisher=New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission |date=March 9, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Roosevelt Island Tramway|aerial tramway]] that transports commuters between [[Roosevelt Island]] and Manhattan, and a ferry system connecting Manhattan to various locales within and outside the city.

The busiest ferry in the United States is the [[Staten Island Ferry]], which annually carries approximately 20 million passengers on the {{convert|5.2|mi|km|sing=on}} run between Staten Island and Lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.siferry.com/|title=The Staten Island Ferry|publisher=SIFerry.com.|accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Staten Island Railway]] rapid transit system solely serves Staten Island. The [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]] (&quot;PATH&quot; train) links Midtown and Lower Manhattan to [[northeastern New Jersey]], primarily [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. Like the New York City Subway, the PATH operates 24 hours a day; meaning two of the four rapid transit systems in the world which operate on 24-hour schedules are wholly or partly in New York (the others are a portion of the [[Chicago 'L']] and the [[PATCO Speedline]] serving Philadelphia).

To complement New York's vast mass transit network, the city also has an extensive web of [[freeway|expressways]] and [[parkway]]s, that link New York City to [[Northern New Jersey]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[Long Island]], and southwest [[Connecticut]] through various [[Bridges and tunnels in New York City|bridges and tunnels]].

Despite New York's reliance on public transit, roads are a defining feature of the city. [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|Manhattan's street grid plan]] greatly influenced the city's physical development.

==Military==
New York City is home to [[Fort Hamilton]], the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military's]] only active duty installation within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nagpra/documents/BASES.PDF| title=Map of Military Installations in the Contiguous US |publisher=NPS.gov|accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1825 in [[Brooklyn]] on the site of a small battery utilized during the [[American Revolution]], it is one of America's longest serving military forts.&lt;ref&gt;

===New York City Global Partners network===
In 2006, the Sister City Program of the City of New York, Inc. was restructured and renamed ''New York City Global Partners''. New York City has expanded its international outreach via this program to a network of cities worldwide, promoting the exchange of ideas and [[innovation]] between their citizenry and policymakers, according to the city's website. The list of historic sister cities above was consolidated into the Global Partners network and joined by the cities below,&lt;ref name = GlobalOutreach/&gt; including [[Chongqing]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Tel Aviv]] (three &quot;non-historic&quot; sister cities of New York).

[[File:Atlantic Ocean to Africa.ogv|thumb|300px| This video was taken by the crew of [[Expedition 29]] on board the [[International Space Station|ISS]]. The pass starts from just north-east of the Island of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] over the North Atlantic Ocean to central Africa, over South Sudan.]]

The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the second-largest of the world's [[ocean]]ic divisions. With a total [[area]] of about {{convert|106,400,000|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;&quot;The New Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;, Volume 2, Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1974. p.294&lt;/ref&gt; it covers approximately 20 percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and about 29 percent of its [[water]] surface area. The first part of its name refers to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], making the Atlantic the &quot;Sea of Atlas&quot;.

The oldest known mention of &quot;Atlantic&quot; is in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): ''Atlantis thalassa'' (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: Sea of Atlas). The term Ethiopic Ocean, derived from [[Ethiopia]], was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Ripley|author2=Charles Anderson Dana|title=The American cyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ROQXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=1873|publisher=Appleton|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Europeans discovered other oceans, the term &quot;ocean&quot; itself was synonymous with the waters beyond the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] that we now know as the Atlantic.  The early Greeks believed this ocean to be a [[Oceanus|gigantic river encircling the world]].

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] to the east, and the [[Americas]] to the west. As one component of the interconnected [[World Ocean|global ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]] (which is sometimes considered{{by whom|date=August 2012}}  a sea of the Atlantic), to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south. (Other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to [[Antarctica]].) The [[equator]] subdivides it into the '''North Atlantic Ocean''' and '''South Atlantic Ocean'''.

==Geography==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|250px|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the western coast of [[Portugal]]|alt=Photo of surf breaking on rocky shore]]
The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the [[Denmark Strait]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]]. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are [[Europe]]; the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (where it connects with the [[Mediterranean Sea]]–one of its [[marginal sea]]s–and, in turn, the [[Black Sea]], both of which also touch upon [[Asia]]) and Africa.

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The [[20th meridian east|20° East meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]] defines its border. Some authorities show it extending south to Antarctica, while others show it bounded at the [[60th parallel south|60° parallel]] by the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iodeweb5.vliz.be/oceanteacher/index.php?module=contextview&amp;action=contextdownload&amp;id=gen11Srv32Nme37_366 ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'']. International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southwest, the [[Drake Passage]] connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The [[wikt:man-made|man-made]] [[Panama Canal]] links the Atlantic and Pacific. Besides those mentioned, other large bodies of water adjacent to the Atlantic are the [[Caribbean Sea]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; [[Hudson Bay]]; the Arctic Ocean; the Mediterranean Sea; the [[North Sea]]; the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Celtic Sea]].

Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic is second in size to the Pacific. With its adjacent seas, it occupies an area of about {{convert|106400000|km2|sqmi}};&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot; /&gt; without them, it has an area of {{convert|82400000|km2|sqmi}}. The land that drains into the Atlantic covers four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometers (85,100,000&amp;nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000&amp;nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&amp;nbsp;cu mi).

The average depth of the Atlantic, with its adjacent seas, is {{convert|3339|m|fathom ft|lk=out}}; without them it is {{convert|3926|m|fathom ft}}. The greatest depth, [[Milwaukee Deep]] with {{convert|8380|m|fathom ft}}, is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]]. The Atlantic's width varies from {{convert|1538|nmi|km mi|lk=in}} between [[Brazil]] and [[Sierra Leone]] to over {{convert|3450|nmi|km mi|-2}} in the south.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Cultural significance==
[[Transatlantic crossing|Transatlantic travel]] played a major role in the expansion of Western civilization into the Americas. It is the Atlantic that separates the &quot;[[Old World]]&quot; from the &quot;[[New World]]&quot;. In [[modern history|modern times]], some [[idiom]]s refer to the ocean in a humorously diminutive way as '''the Pond''', describing both the geographical and cultural divide between North America and Europe, in particular between the English-speaking nations of both continents. Many British people refer to the United States and Canada as &quot;across the pond&quot;, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Example: BBC Click – Episode 04 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Black Atlantic&quot; refers to the role of this ocean in shaping black people's history, not least in diasporas. Irish migration to the US is meant when the term &quot;The Green Atlantic&quot; is used. The &quot;Red Atlantic&quot; is a relatively new term that refers to seafarers as proletarians and revolutionaries who historically resisted exploitation at sea and forged a new multicultural and polyglot Atlantic working-class. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Armitage|title=The Red Atlantic|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v029/29.4armitage.html|publisher=Project MUSE|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean bottom==
[[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|thumb|Atlantic [[bathymetry]]|Map that uses color to show ocean depth]]
The principal feature of the [[bathymetry]] (bottom [[topography]]) is a [[Mid-ocean ridge|submarine mountain range]] called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Challenger at Sea: A Ship That Revolutionized Earth Science| year = 1992| isbn = 978-0-691-08735-1| page = 57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It extends from [[Iceland]] in the north to approximately [[58th parallel south|58° South latitude]], reaching a maximum width of about {{convert|860|nmi|km mi|-1}}. A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than {{convert|2700|m|fathom ft}} in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep. Several peaks rise above the water and form islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Mediterranean Was a Desert: A Voyage of the Glomar Challenger| year = 1987| isbn = 978-0-691-02406-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the [[Walvis Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Atlas of the World: Revised Sixth Edition, National Geographic Society, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|troughs]] with depths from {{convert|3700|-|5500|m|fathom ft}}. Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the [[Blake Basin|Blake]], Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, [[abyssal plains]], [[oceanic trench|trenches]], [[seamount]]s, [[Oceanic basin|basins]], [[Oceanic plateau|plateaus]], [[Submarine canyon|canyons]], and some [[guyot]]s. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.

Ocean floor trenches and seamounts:
* [[Puerto Rico Trench]], in the North Atlantic, is the deepest trench at {{convert|8605|m|fathom ft}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sea-seek.com/site/Milwaukee_Deep Milwaukee Deep]. sea-seek.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of [[Canada]]
* [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of {{convert|8428|m|fathom ft}}
* [[Romanche Trench]] is located near the [[equator]] and reaches a depth of about {{convert|7454|m|fathom ft}}.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of:
* [[Terrigenous]] deposits with land origins, consisting of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by [[erosion]], [[weathering]], and volcanic activity on land washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest near large river mouths or off desert coasts.
* [[Pelagic]] deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from {{convert|60|-|3300|m|fathom ft}} they are thickest in the convergence belts, notably at the [[Hamilton Ridge]] and in upwelling zones.
* [[Authigenic]] deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits, such as in the [[Hewett Curve]].

==Water characteristics==
[[File:Circulacion termohalina.jpg|Path of the [[thermohaline circulation]]. Purple paths represent deep-water currents, while blue paths represent surface currents.|thumb|alt=Map displaying a looping line with arrows indicating that water flows eastward in the far Southern ocean, angling north east of Australia, turning sough after passing Alaska, then crossing the mid-Pacific to flow north of Australia, continuing west below Africa, then turning northwest until reaching eastern Canada, then angling east to southern Europe, then finally turning south just below Greenland and flowing down the Americas' eastern coast, and resuming its flow eastward to complete the circle]]
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major ocean gyres|alt=Map showing 5 circles. The first is between western Australia and eastern Africa. The second is between eastern Australia and western South America. The third is between Japan and western North America. Of the two in the Atlantic, one is in hemisphere.]]
On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water [[salinity]] in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and [[sea ice]] melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about [[25th parallel north|25° north]] and [[25th parallel south|south]], in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below {{convert|−2|C|F}}. Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by 7–8 °C (12–15°F).

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters make up the surface. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of {{convert|1000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] reaches depths of as much as {{convert|4000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 metres.

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate the [[Sargasso Sea]], a large elongated body of water, with above average salinity. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]] and is also the spawning ground for both the [[European eel]] and the [[American eel]].

The [[Coriolis effect]] circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above 40° North some east-west oscillation occurs.

==Climate==
[[File:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|right|Waves in the [[trade wind]]s in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.|alt=Map of Caribbean showing seven approximately parallel westward-pointing arrows that extend from east of the Virgin Islands to Cuba. The southern arrows bend northward just east of the Dominican Republic before straightening out again.]]

Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.

The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.

The [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe and influences weather and climate as far south as the northern Mediterranean. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] area) and Africa's north-western coast. In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean.  More  local   particular weather examples could be found in examples such as the; [[Azores High]], [[Benguela Current]], [[Nor'easter]].

==History==
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Animation showing the separation of [[Pangaea]], which formed the Atlantic Ocean known today|alt=Animation showing the continents separating from a single mass, making creating the Atlantic in the process]]
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the five oceans. It did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent [[Pangaea]] were drifting apart from seafloor spreading. The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements along its shores.

The [[Viking]]s, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and the Spaniards were the most famous among early explorers. After Columbus, European exploration rapidly accelerated, and many new trade routes were established.

As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the [[Americas]] (known as transatlantic trade). Scientific explorations include the [[Challenger expedition]], the [[German Meteor expedition]], [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and the [[United States Navy Hydrographic Office]].

===Notable crossings===

* Around 1010, [[Thorfinn Karlsefni|Thorfinnr Karlsefni]] led an attempted [[Viking]] settlement in North America with 160 settlers, but was later driven off by the natives. His son [[Snorri Thorfinnsson]] was the first American born (somewhere between 1010 and 1013) to European (Icelandic) immigrant parents.
* In 1419 and 1427, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese navigators]] reached [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]], respectively.

* 1914–1918, the [[First Battle of the Atlantic]] took place.
* In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[seaplane]] to cross the Atlantic (though it made a couple of landings on islands and the sea along the way, and taxied several hundred miles).
* Later in 1919, a British [[aeroplane]] piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight, from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]].

==Ethiopic Ocean==
The '''[[Aethiopian Sea]]''', '''Ethiopic Ocean''' or '''Ethiopian Ocean''' (Okeanos Aithiopos), is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean, which is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow region between [[Natal, Brazil]] and [[Monrovia, Liberia]].  The use of this term illustrates a past trend towards referring to the whole continent of [[Africa]] by the name ''[[Name of Ethiopia|Aethiopia]]''.  The modern nation of Ethiopia, in northeast Africa, is nowhere near the Ethiopic Ocean, which would be said to lie off the west coast of Africa. The term Ethiopian Ocean sometimes appeared until the mid-19th century, as e.g. on the map ''The Dutch colony of the Cape of Good Hope by L.S. de la Rochette, MDCCXCV'', published by W. Faden in London in 1795.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Economy==
The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant [[petroleum]] deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves. The Atlantic hosts the world's richest [[fishing]] resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major fish are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]].

The most productive areas include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]'s [[Grand Banks]], the [[Nova Scotia]] shelf, [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the [[Bahama Banks]], the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s appear in great quantities. Various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the [[incineration]] of toxic wastes at sea. &lt;!-- This would be good if it were in an infobox

Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the Caribbean Sea or up the east coast of [[North America]]; hurricanes can occur from May to December but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.
--&gt;

==Terrain==
From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and Baltic Sea. A clockwise warm-water [[gyre]] occupies the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre appears in the southern Atlantic. The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]] dominates the ocean floor. This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the ocean floor and the islands rising from it.

The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Norwegian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Gulf of Maine]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Caribbean Sea]].

[[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|Islands]] include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (including hundreds of surrounding islands), [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Great Britain]] (including numerous surrounding islands), [[Ireland]], [[Rockall]], [[Sable Island]], [[Azores]], [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Madeira]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Caribbean]], [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Annobón Province]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Gough Island]] (Also known as Diego Alvarez), [[Falkland Islands]], [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[South Georgia Island]], [[South Sandwich Islands]], and [[Bouvet Island]].

===Natural resources===
The Atlantic harbors [[petroleum]] and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], [[marine mammal]]s ([[Pinniped|seals]] and whales), [[sand]] and [[gravel]] aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, [[polymetallic nodules]], and precious stones.

===Natural hazards===
[[File:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg with surrounding clouds|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg]]
[[Iceberg]]s are common from February to August in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and [[Madeira]]. Ships are subject to [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in the extreme north from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The United States' southeast coast has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs. The Virginia and North Carolina coasts were particularly dangerous.

The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but [[Coast Guard]] records do not support this belief.

[[Hurricanes]] are also a natural hazard in the Atlantic, but mainly in the northern part of the ocean, rarely [[tropical cyclones]] form in the southern parts. Hurricanes usually form between June 1 and November 30 of every year.

==Current environmental issues==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. [[Drift net]] fishing can kill [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arus12bcenvtlafflrev473.htm Problems and Prospects for the Pelagic Driftnet]. animallaw.info. Retrieved on 2011-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal pollution comes from the eastern [[United States]], southern [[Brazil]], and eastern [[Argentina]]; [[oil pollution]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]]; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.

In 2005, there was some concern that warm northern European currents were slowing down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5033329 Atlantic Ocean's 'Heat Engine' Chills Down] by Christopher Joyce. All Things Considered, National Public Radio, 30 Nov, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

===Marine pollution===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
{{See also|Ship pollution}}
Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture [[fertilizer]] chemicals as well as [[livestock]] and [[human]] waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian A. Gerlach &quot;Marine Pollution&quot;, Springer, Berlin (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine debris]], which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[Oceanic gyres|gyres]] and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

'''Alcatraz Island''' is located in the [[San Francisco Bay]], {{convert|1.5|mi}} offshore from [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=ebonline&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | title=Alcatraz Island | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13237/Alcatraz-Island | year=2009 | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as &quot;'''The Rock''',&quot; the small island was developed with facilities for a [[Alcatraz Island Lighthouse|lighthouse]], a military fortification, a military prison (1868), and a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] from 1933 until 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odier&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Odier | first=Odier | title=The Rock: A History of Alcatraz: The Fort/The Prison | publisher=L'Image Odier | year=1982 | isbn=0-9611632-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Aboriginal Peoples]] from San Francisco who were part of a wave of Native [[activism]] across the nation with public protests through the 1970s. In 1972 Alcatraz became a national recreation area and received designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.

Today, the island's facilities are managed by the [[National Park Service]] as part of the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]; it is open to tours. Visitors can reach the island by [[ferry]] ride from Pier 33, near [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco]]. [[Hornblower Cruises]] and Events, operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises, is the official ferry provider to and from the island.  Hornblower launched the nation's first hybrid propulsion ferry in 2008, the [[Hornblower Hybrid]], which now serves the island, docking at the [[Alcatraz Wharf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WaitleyWaitley1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waitley|first1=Denis|last2=Waitley|first2=Dayna|last3=Waitley|first3=Deborah|title=The psychology of winning for women|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TVwOd5LADooC|accessdate=10 September 2012|date=25 April 1999|publisher=Executive Excellence Publishing|isbn=978-1-890009-13-7|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is home to the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|abandoned prison]], the site of the oldest operating [[lighthouse]] on the [[west coast of the United States]], early military [[fortification]]s, and natural features such as [[rock pool]]s and a [[seabird]] colony (mostly [[Western Gull]]s, [[cormorant]]s, and [[egret]]s). According to a 1971 documentary on the History of Alcatraz, the island measures {{convert|1675|ft}} by {{convert|590|ft}} and is {{convert|135|ft}} at highest point during mean tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;docu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqHBkasgNgE|title=This Is An Alcatraz Documentary (Part 1)|publisher=Narrated by [[Howard Duff]]|year=1971|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the total area of the island is reported to be {{convert|22|acre}}.&lt;ref name=ebonline/&gt;

===Military garrison===
The earliest recorded owner of the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by [[Mexico|Mexican]] governor [[Pio Pico]] in June, 1846, with the understanding that Workman would build a lighthouse on it. Julian Workman is the baptismal name of [[Workman-Temple family|William Workman]], co-owner of [[Rancho La Puente]] and personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as Military Governor of California, [[John C. Fremont]], champion of [[Manifest Destiny]] and leader of the [[Bear Flag Republic]], bought the island for $5,000 in the name of the [[United States government]] from Francis Temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;docu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/expeditionsofjoh02fr/expeditionsofjoh02fr_djvu.txt |title=Full text of &quot;The expeditions of John Charles Frémont&quot; |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sgha.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgha.net/articles/fh.html |title=Famous Hauntings |publisher=Sgha.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A530641 |title=h2g2 – Alcatraz, San Francisco, California, USA |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, President [[Millard Fillmore]] ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically as a United States military reservation,&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the [[Mexican-American War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/wwIIbayarea/alc.htm |title=Alcatraz-World War II in the San Francisco Bay Area: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fremont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Fremont nothing. Fremont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;sgha.net&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;/&gt; 

Following the acquisition of California by the United States as a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848) which ended the [[Mexican-American War]], and the onset of the [[California Gold Rush]] the following year, the [[U.S. Army]] began studying the suitability of Alcatraz Island for the positioning of coastal batteries to protect the approaches to San Francisco Bay. In 1853, under the direction of [[Zealous B. Tower]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] began fortifying the island, work which continued until 1858, eventuating in Fortress Alcatraz. The island's first garrison at Camp Alcatraz, numbering about 200 soldiers and 11 cannon, arrived at the end of that year. When the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861 the island mounted 85 cannon (increased to 105 cannon by 1866) in casemates around its perimeter, though the small size of the garrison meant only a fraction of the guns could be used at one time. At this time it also served as the San Francisco Arsenal for storage of firearms to prevent them falling into the hands of [[Copperheads (politics)|Confederate sympathizers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hannings 2005 36&quot;/&gt; Alcatraz built as a &quot;heavily fortified military site on the West Coast&quot; formed a &quot;triangle of defense&quot; along with Fort Point and Lime Point, ensured security to the bay. The island was also the site of the first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; Alcatraz never fired its guns offensively, though during the war it was used to imprison [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers and [[privateer]]s on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/Alcatraz.html |title=Historic Posts, Camps, Stations and Airfields: Post at Alcatraz Island |publisher=Militarymuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110206060414/http://militarymuseum.org/Alcatraz.html| archivedate= 6 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military prison====
{{main|Alcatraz Citadel}}
Because of its isolation from the outside by the cold, strong, hazardous currents of the waters of San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz was used to house Civil War [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]] as early as 1861. 

Following the war in 1866, the army determined that the fortifications and guns were being rapidly rendered obsolete by advances in military technology. Modernization efforts, including an ambitious plan to level the entire island and construct shell-proof underground magazines and tunnels, were undertaken between 1870 and 1876 but never completed (the so-called &quot;parade ground&quot; on the southern tip of the island represents the extent of the flattening effort).&lt;ref&gt;''Alcatraz Preservation Project: Exposing the Layers of An American Landmark'' (pamphlet), Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the army switched the focus of its plans for Alcatraz from coastal defense to detention, a task for which it was well suited because of its isolation. In 1867, a brick jailhouse was built (previously inmates had been kept in the basement of the guardhouse), and in 1868, Alcatraz was officially designated a long-term detention facility for military prisoners. Among those incarcerated at Alcatraz were confederates caught on the west coast,&lt;ref name=&quot;docu&quot;/&gt; and some [[Hopi]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] men in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The most painful story of resistance to assimilation programs and compulsory school attendance laws involved the Hopis in Arizona, who surrendered a group of men to the military rather than voluntarily relinquish their children. The Hopi men served time in federal prison at Alcatraz&quot;. {{cite book

In 1898, the [[Spanish-American war]] increased the prison population from 26 to over 450. After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], civilian prisoners were transferred to Alcatraz for safe confinement. On March 21, 1907, Alcatraz was officially designated as the Western U.S. Military Prison, later

It was completed in 1912. To accommodate the new cell block, the Citadel, a three-story barracks, was demolished down to the first floor, which was actually below ground level. The building had been constructed in an excavated pit (creating a dry &quot;moat&quot;) to enhance its defensive potential. The first floor was then incorporated as a basement to the new cell block, giving rise to the popular legend of &quot;dungeons&quot; below the main cell block. The Fortress was deactivated as a military prison in October 1933 and transferred to the [[Bureau of Prisons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hannings 2005 36&quot;/&gt;

During [[World War I]], the prison held [[conscientious objectors]], including [[Philip Grosser]], who wrote a pamphlet entitled ''Uncle Sam's Devil's Island'' about his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;

The United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz was acquired by the [[United States Department of Justice]] on October 12, 1933, and the island became a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] federal prison in August 1934. Alcatraz was designed to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oliver |first=Marilyn Tower |title=Alcatraz Prison in American HIstory |year=1998 |publisher=Enslow Publishers Inc |location=Berkley Heights, NJ |isbn=0-89490-990-8|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 9:40 am in the morning of August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] at [[Santa Venetia, California]], before being escorted to Alcatraz, handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by some 60 special FBI agents, U.S. Marshals and railway security officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;docu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AH29&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-029.htm|title=For Desperate or Irredeemable Types United States Federal Penitentiary Alcatraz|publisher=A History of Alcatraz Island, 1847-1972, Historic Resources Study|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and murderers.&lt;ref name=&quot;docu&quot;/&gt; The prison initially had a staff of 155, including the first warden [[James A.

During the 29 years it was in use, the jail held some of the worst hoodlums America had ever known,&lt;ref name=&quot;docu&quot;/&gt; such as [[Al Capone]], [[Robert Franklin Stroud]] (the Birdman of Alcatraz), [[George &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly]],  [[Bumpy Johnson]], [[Rafael Cancel Miranda]] (a member of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]] who attacked the [[United States Capitol]] building in 1954),&lt;ref name=&quot;ESF&quot;&gt;&quot;Former Alcatraz inmate speaks about his time&quot;, ''San Francisco Examiner'', by D.

It also provided housing for the Bureau of Prisons staff and their families.

During its 29 years of operation, the penitentiary claimed that no prisoner successfully escaped. A total of 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts, two men trying twice; 23 were caught, six were shot and killed during their escape, two drowned, and five are listed as &quot;missing and presumed drowned&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/escapes1.htm |title=Alcatraz Escape Attempts |publisher=Alcatrazhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most violent occurred on May 2, 1946, when a failed escape attempt by six prisoners led to the [[Battle of Alcatraz]].

Because the penitentiary cost much more to operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per prisoner per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ocean View Publishing Company |url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rs5.htm |title=A Brief History of Alcatraz, p. 5 |publisher=Alcatrazhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and half a century of salt [[water saturation]] had severely eroded the buildings, then [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] ordered the penitentiary closed on March 21, 1963. In addition, citizens were increasingly protesting the environmental effects of sewage released into San Francisco Bay from the approximately 250 inmates and 60 Bureau of Prisons families on the island. That year, the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|United States Penitentiary]] in [[Marion, Illinois]], on land, opened as the replacement facility for Alcatraz.

===Native American occupation===
{{Main|Occupation of Alcatraz}}
[[File:Alcatraz Island 01 Prison sign.jpg|thumb|left|A lingering sign of the 1969–71 Native American occupation (2006 Photograph).]]

Alcatraz Island was occupied by Native American activists for the first time on March 8, 1964. The event was reported, among others in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Beginning on November 20, 1969, a group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] called [[Alcatraz-Red Power Movement|United Indians of All Tribes]], mostly college students from San Francisco, occupied the island to protest federal policies related to American Indians. Some of them were children of Indians who had resettled in the city as part of an urbanization program encouraged by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) from the 1930s to the 1950s. The BIA hoped to give Indians new opportunities in the cities, as many [[Indian reservations]] were isolated from job markets.

The occupiers, who stayed on the island for nearly two years, demanded the island's facilities be adapted and new structures built for an Indian education center, ecology center and cultural center. The American Indians claimed the island by provisions of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] between the U.S. and the Sioux; they said the treaty promised to return all retired, abandoned or out-of-use federal lands to the Native peoples from whom it was acquired. (Note: The Treaty of 1868 stated that all abandoned or unused federal land adjacent to the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] could be reclaimed by descendants of the Sioux Nation.) Indians of All Tribes then claimed Alcatraz Island by the &quot;Right of Discovery&quot;, as indigenous peoples knew it thousands of years before any Europeans had come to North America. Begun by urban Indians of San Francisco, the occupation attracted other Native Americans from across the country, including [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) urban activists from [[Minneapolis]].

The Native Americans demanded reparation for the many treaties broken by the US government and for the lands which were taken from so many tribes. In discussing the Right of Discovery, the [[historian]] Troy R. Johnson states in ''The Occupation of Alcatraz Island'', that [[indigenous peoples]] knew about Alcatraz at least 10,000 years before any European knew about any part of North America.

Native Americans objected to federal policies such as intense pressure to send their children to boarding schools.  They cited the Moqui [[Hopi]] in 1895, who were held as military prisoners by the US. The U.S. government offered to release the people if they agreed to send their children to U.S. Indian schools. The Hopi refused, believing this would cause their culture to deteriorate and force [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. The effect of the policy was to break any positive relations the Hopi may have built with the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Larry R. Solomon, ''Roots of Justice, You Are Now on Indian Land,'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteen months and nine days of occupation by the American Indians, several buildings at Alcatraz were damaged or destroyed by fire, including the recreation hall, the Coast Guard quarters and the warden's home. The origin of the fires is disputed. The U.S. government demolished a number of other buildings (mostly apartments) after the occupation had ended. [[Graffiti]] from the period of Native American occupation are still visible at many locations on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~aisstudy/alcatraz/index.html Alcatraz Island], California State University Long Beach&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occupation, President [[Richard Nixon]] rescinded the [[Indian termination policy]], designed by earlier administrations to end federal recognition of tribes and their special relationship with the US government. He established a new [[Native American self-determination|policy of self-determination]], in part as a result of the publicity and awareness created by the occupation. The occupation ended on June 11, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Indians of All Tribes, ''Alcatraz Is Not an Island'', Berkeley, Wingbow Press, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a succession of demands at Alcatraz, the U.S. government returned excess, unused land to the [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]], [[Yakama]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Washoe people|Washoe]] tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 2011 a permanent multimedia exhibit was opened on Alcatraz examining the 19-month occupation. Located in the former band practice room in a cellblock in the basement, the space serves as the cultural center the Native American occupiers requested upon their occupation. The exhibit, called &quot;We Are Still Here,&quot; features photos, videos and sound recordings gathered by staff and students at [[San Francisco State University]] and [[California State University, East Bay]]. Curators of the exhibit interviewed descendents of occupation leader [[Richard Oakes (activist)|Richard Oakes]], and others who participated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exhibit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Meredith May | title=American Indians get permanent exhibit at Alcatraz | work=Bay Area &amp; State | publisher=[[SFGate]] | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2011%2F11%2F20%2FBAD71M1T4B.DTL | accessdate=20 November 2011 | date=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today American Indian groups, such as the [[International Indian Treaty Council]], hold ceremonies on the island, most notably, their &quot;Sunrise Gatherings&quot; every [[Columbus Day]] and [[Thanksgiving Day]].

The [[Global Peace Foundation]] proposed to raze the prison and build a peace center in its place. During the previous year, supporters collected 10,350 signatures that placed it on the presidential primary ballots in San Francisco for February 5, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0465051020080204?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews | title=Voters consider changing Alcatraz to peace center | date=February 4, 2008 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed plan was estimated at [[United States Dollar|$]]1 billion. For the plan to pass, [[United States Congress|Congress]] would have had to have taken Alcatraz out of the National Park Service. Critics of the plan said that Alcatraz is too rich in history to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Locke |first=Michelle |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2008/feb/02/activist_wants_transform_alcatraz_global_peace_cen/ |title=LJWorld.com / Activist wants to transform Alcatraz into global peace center |publisher=.ljworld.com |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2008, the Alcatraz Island Global Peace Center Proposition C failed to pass, with 72% of voters rejecting the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc11.com/politics/15160200/detail.html |title=Elections and Results &amp;#124; KNTV Bay Area |publisher=NBC 11|date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna and flora==

===Habitat===
[[File:Phalacrocorax penicillatus 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brandt's Cormorant]] nesting on Alcatraz Island]]
*[[Cisterns]]. A bluff that, because of its moist crevices, is believed to be an important site for [[California slender salamander]]s.
*Cliff tops at the island's north end. Containing a onetime manufacturing building and a [[plaza]], the area is listed as important to nesting and roosting birds.
*The [[power station|powerhouse]] area. A steep embankment where native grassland and creeping [[Elymus (genus)|wild rye]] support a habitat for [[deer mice]].
*[[Tide pools]]. A series of them, created by long-ago quarrying activities, contains still-unidentified invertebrate species and marine algae.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} They form one of the few tide-pool complexes in the bay, according to the report.
*Western cliffs and cliff tops. Rising to heights of nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}}, they provide nesting and roosting sites for sea birds including [[pigeon guillemot]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[Heermann's Gull]]s, and [[Western Gull]]s. [[Harbor seal]]s can occasionally be seen on a small beach at the base.
*The parade grounds. Carved from the hillside during the late 19th century and covered with rubble since the government demolished [[Corrections officer|guard]] housing in 1971, the area has become a habitat and breeding ground for [[black-crowned night heron]]s, [[western gull]]s, [[slender salamander]]s, and [[deer mice]].
*The Agave Path, a trail named for its dense growth of [[agave]]. Located atop a shoreline bulkhead on the south side, it provides a nesting habitat for [[night heron]]s.
*Alcatraz prison and its surroundings.

===Flora===
[[File:Alcatraz smt.jpg|thumb|Flowers on Alcatraz]]
Gardens planted by families of the original Army post, and later by families of the prison guards, fell into neglect after the prison closure in 1963. After 40 years, they are being restored by a paid staff member and many volunteers, thanks to funding by the Garden Conservancy and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. The untended gardens had become severely overgrown and had developed into a nesting habitat and sanctuary for numerous birds. Now, areas of bird habitat are being preserved and protected, while many of the gardens are being restored to their original state.

In clearing out the overgrowth, workers found that many of the original plants were growing where they had been planted – some more than 100 years ago. Numerous heirloom rose hybrids, including a Welsh rose that had been believed to be extinct, have been discovered and propagated. Many species of roses, [[succulents]], and [[geraniums]] are growing among apple and fig trees, banks of sweet peas, manicured gardens of cutting flowers, and wildly overgrown sections of native grasses with blackberry and honeysuckle.

==In popular culture==
{{main|Alcatraz Island in popular culture}}
Alcatraz Island appears often in popular culture, including the films ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' (2010), ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006), ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002),  ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996), ''[[Murder in the First]]'' (1995), ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962), and [[J. J. Abrams]]' 2012 television series ''[[Alcatraz (TV series)|Alcatraz]]''.  It also was featured in the animated series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (2000 TV series)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', in the book &quot;[[Al Capone Does My Shirts]]&quot; and in the video game [[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]] in zombie survival mode. Alcatraz has also been often portrayed as a safe haven or [[headquarters | base of operations]] in many [[post-apocalyptic movies]], such as ''The Book of Eli''.

The '''Lüneburg Heath''' ({{lang-de|Lüneburger Heide}}; also '''Lunenburg Heath''' in English) is a large area of [[heath (habitat)|heath]], [[Geest (topography)|geest]] and [[woodland]] in northeastern part of the state of [[Lower Saxony]] in northern [[Germany]]. It forms part of the [[hinterland]] for the cities of [[Hamburg]], [[Hanover]], and [[Bremen]] and is named after the town of [[Lüneburg]]. Most of the area is a [[nature reserve (Germany)|nature reserve]]. [[Northern Low Saxon]] is still widely spoken in the region.

The Lüneburg Heath has extensive areas of [[heath (habitat)|heathland]], typical of those that covered most of the North German countryside until about 1800, but which have almost completely disappeared in other areas. The heaths were formed after the [[Neolithic]] period by [[overgrazing]] of the once widespread forests on the poor sandy soils of the [[geestland|geest]], as this slightly hilly and sandy terrain in northern Europe is called. The Lüneburg Heath is therefore a historic  [[cultural landscape]]. The remaining areas of heath are kept clear mainly through grazing, especially by a North German breed of moorland sheep called the ''[[Heidschnucke]]''. Due to its unique landscape, the Lüneburg Heath is a popular tourist destination in [[North Germany]].

From a geographical point of view the Lüneburg Heath is a specific [[natural region]], that is an area distinguished by a specific combination of abiotic factors (climate, relief, water resources, soil, geology) and biotic factors ([[flora]] and [[fauna]]). The Lüneburg Heath is a sub-division of the [[North European Plain]]. In the list of the major natural regions of Germany issued by the [[Federal Office for Nature Conservation]] (''Bundesamt für Naturschutz'') it is region number D28.

The Lüneburg Heath covers an area which includes the districts (''[[Landkreis]]e'') of [[Landkreis Celle|Celle]], [[Landkreis Gifhorn|Gifhorn]], [[Landkreis Heidekreis|Heidekreis]], [[Landkreis Uelzen|Uelzen]], [[Landkreis Lüneburg|Lüneburg]], [[Landkreis Lüchow-Dannenberg|Lüchow-Dannenberg]], southeast [[Landkreis Rotenburg (Wümme)|Rotenburg]] (the town of [[Visselhövede]], [[Fintel]], part of the municipality of [[Scheeßel]] and the eastern half of [[Bothel]]) and the [[Landkreis Harburg|rural district of Harburg]]. The easternmost fringes of the [[Stade Geest]] belonging to [[Landkreis Verden]] are called the [[Linteln Geest]] (''Lintelner Geest'') or [[Verden Heath]] (''Verdener Heide'') and form part of the municipality of [[Kirchlinteln]]. This region has no sharply defined boundary with the Lüneburg Heath.

The Lüneburg Heath lies between the rivers [[Elbe]] to the north, the [[Drawehn]] to the east, the [[Aller]] to the south and southwest, the middle course of the [[Wümme]] to the west and the [[Harburg Hills]] (''Harburger Bergen'') to the northwest.

On the northwestern edge of the Lüneburg Heath are the Harburg Hills and south of [[Schneverdingen]] there are [[bogs]], such as the [[Pietzmoor]] ([[:Image:pietzmoor.jpg|see photo]]). Also of note are other smaller bogs in [[sinkhole]]s, like the ''[[Grundloses Moor]]'' (&quot;bottomless bog&quot;) near Walsrode or the [[Bullenkuhle (Moor)|Bullenkuhle]] near Bokel (part of [[Sprakensehl]]). The eastern boundary to the [[Hanoverian Wendland|Wendland]] is formed by the [[Göhrde]]-[[Drawehn]] Hills (the Ostheide natural region). Parts of the Lüneburg Heath are in the ''[[Südheide Nature Park]]'', others in the ''[[Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]]''.

=== Hills and elevations ===
[[Image:Wilseder Berg 005.jpg|left|thumb|View of the [[Wilseder Berg]]]]
The highest elevation on the Lüneburg Heath is the [[Wilseder Berg]] ({{convert|169.2|m|ft}} above [[Normalnull|NN]]). Other hills over {{convert|100|m|ft}} high are: [[Falkenberg (Lüneburger Heide)|Falkenberg]] (150 m), near [[Bergen (Landkreis Celle)|Bergen]], Ahrberg (145 m), Hakenberg (143 m), [[Hoher Mechtin]] (142 m), Pampower Berg (140 m), Lüßberg (130 m), [[Brunsberg (Harburg)|Brunsberg]], near [[Sprötze]] (129 m), Goldbockenberg (129 m), Hingstberg (126 m), Staffelberg (126 m), Hengstberg (121 m), Höpenberg near Schneverdingen (120), [[Haußelberg]] (119.1 m), Breithorn (118 m), Mützenberg (115 m), Tellmer Berg (113 m), Wümmeberg (107.9 m), Schiffberg (107 m), Hummelsberg and Wulfsberg (each 106 m), Drullberg and Thonhopsberg (each 104 m), Kruckberg and [[Wietzer Berg]] (each 102 m) and Höllenberg (101 m).

Several of these hills - the Wilseder Berg, the Falkenberg, the Haußelberg and the Breithorn - were used by the mathematician, [[Carl Friedrich Gauß]], as [[triangulation station]]s in his topographical surveys of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] from 1821–1825.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/e/2005/gausscd/html/kapitel_landv_karte.htm gwdg.de – Overview of surveyed triangulation systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rivers and streams ===
[[River]]s in the area, beside the numerous small [[stream|heathland streams]], include the [[Wümme]], which rises on the western slopes of the Wilseder Berg, in the south the [[Lachte]] with its tributary the [[Lutter (Lachte)|Lutter]], and the [[Aller]], the [[Vissel]], the [[Böhme]], the [[Grindau]], the [[Meiße]] and the [[Örtze]]. They all belong to the [[Weser]] river system. Those flowing into the [[Elbe]] are the [[Aue (Elbe)|Aue]], the [[Ilmenau River|Ilmenau]], the [[Luhe (Ilmenau)|Luhe]] and the [[Seeve]].

=== Geology ===
The immediate subsurface layers on the Lüneburg Heath are almoste exclusively made up of deposits from the [[quaternary ice age]]. The landscape consists of flat plains of [[ground moraine]]s, ridges of hilly [[terminal moraine]]s and also of [[sandar]] - glacial outwash plains deposited at the edge of the ice sheet. 

During the Saalian Stage (230,000–130,000 years ago) the area of the present-day Lüneburg Heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet. In the last glacial period (110,000–10,000 years ago) the ice sheet no longer covered the Lüneburg Heath area; it reached only as far as the [[River Elbe]]. Due to the lack of vegetation, the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water, wind and by [[soil fluction]]; this resulted in valleys like the Totengrund. The material displaced by [[erosion]] is referred to as [[sediment]] (''Geschiebedecksand'') and, in the Lüneburg Heath, has a depth of 0.4 to 0.8 metres (on slopes up to 1.5 metres).

''See also:'' [[Drawehn]], [[Bullenkuhle]], [[Kieselgur]].

The region is mostly covered by a [[heath (habitat)|heathland]] landscape consisting of big [[Calluna|heather]] and [[Juniperus communis|juniper]] areas, forests and some smaller [[swamp]]s. In contrast to the areas in the north of the Lüneburg Heath, the landscape is very hilly, as it is placed on a [[terminal moraine]].

=== Natural divisions ===
The Lüneburg Heath is divided into the following natural sub-divisions:
* Hohe Heide
:The Hohe Heide (&quot;High Heath&quot;) consists of a series of [[end moraine]]s from the [[glacier]]s of the [[Saalian glaciation]] (230,000–130,000 years ago) with the  [[Wilseder Berg]] at its heart. Unlike the other natural divisions of the Lüneburg Heath the terrain is quite rugged. Characteristic of the area are dry hilltops, periglacial dry valleys and hollows like the Totengrund. Heathland dominates the landscape. They are part of the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]] and of great importance for tourism. In addition there are also extensive pine forests.
* [[Südheide Nature Park|South Heath]]
:The South Heath (''Südheide'') is dominated by expanses of gently undulating, hilly [[Sander]] plains, and sheets of [[ground moraine]] and the remains of [[end moraine]]s from earlier [[ice age]]s. There are still large areas of heath on the [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area|military training areas near Bad Fallingbostel]] and [[Munster Training Area|Munster (Örtze)]]; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however. The [[Osterheide]] near [[Schneverdingen]] also belongs to this natural subdivision. It is part of the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve]]. Near Schneverdingen and south of [[Soltau]] there are several bogs. A large area of the  Südheide is covered by pine forests.
* [[Ostheide]]
:Numerous end moraines run through the Ostheide (&quot;East Heath&quot;) which stretches on the eastern edge of the Lüneburg Heath from Lüneburg to north of Wolfsburg. In parts of this region the land is intensively cultivated. The northern area, the so-called [[Göhrde]] and the [[Drawehn]], are by contrast mostly wooded like the southern ridge of end moraine.
* Uelzen Basin and Ilmenau depression
:The [[ground moraine]] landscape of the [[Uelzen]] Basin is predominantly used for agriculture. On the surrounding ridges there are also a few pine forests however. There are still large areas of heath here as well, for example the ''Ellerndorfer Heide'' (&quot;Ellerndorf Heath&quot;)  in western [[Uelzen district]] or the ''Klein Bünstorfer Heide'' (&quot;Klein Bünstorf Heath&quot;).
* Luheheide
:The ridges of end moraine on the Luheheide have clearly defined slopes that fall away sharply to the [[Elbe Valley]]. The heath is deeply incised by all the rivers that drain northwards to the [[Elbe]]; rivers such as the [[Seeve]], [[Aue (Elbe)|Aue]], [[Luhe (Ilmenau)]]. The ridges between them are wooded and sparsely populated. Settlements are crowded together in the valleys. There is hardly any heathland left in this area, it has been largely reforested by [[pine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. [http://www.bfn.de/0311_landschaft.html?regionid=14 BFN Lower Saxony Landscape Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/nkdz/fachdatenbank/datenkollektive/phaenologie/beob_netze/naturraumkarte.htm#64 Phenologcal Natural Region Map]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Klima soltau.png|thumb|Climatic diagram for Soltau]]

=== Climate ===
The Lüneburg Heath lies in a temperate maritime climatic region moderated by the Atlantic, with mild winters, cool summers and precipation all-year round. The Hohe Heide, however, has a &quot;low mountain climate&quot; with lower temperatures and higher precipitation than in the surrounding area.

== Nature ==
=== Nature parks and nature reserves ===
[[Image:Karte Naturpark Lüneburger Heide.png|thumb|Location of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]]
In the northwestern part of the Lüneburg Heath is the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Park]] which covers an area of {{convert|1130|km²|sqmi}}. At its heart, around the [[Wilseder Berg]], is the [[Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve]] (''Naturschutzgebiet'' or NSG) founded as long ago as 1921 with {{convert|234|km²|sqmi}} of land which is roughly 58% woods and 20% heathland. Other nature parks in the Lüneburg Heath region are the [[Südheide Nature Park]] and [[Elbufer-Drawehn Nature Park]]. Right in the north of the area is the [[Harburg Hills]] Nature Park. The Lüneburg Heath NSG, together with the open heathland of the huge [[Munster Training Area|Munster Nord and Süd training areas]] and the [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area]], is the largest single area of heathland in [[Central Europe]]. And within the former province (''Regierungsbezirk'') of Lüneburg there are no less than 212 individual [[nature reserves]] (as at 31 December 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlwkn.niedersachsen.de/master/C8425268_N8378167_L20_D0_I5231158.html nlwkn.niedersachsen.de – Nature reserves in Lower Saxony]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of the heath landscape ===
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 107.jpg|thumb|left|Lüneburg Heath]]
&lt;!-- ''Dieser Abschnitt ist noch ausbaufähig! Neben Holzraubbau sind noch das Abbrennen, die [[Plaggen]]wirtschaft und die (übermäßige) Waldbeweidung als anthropogene Ursachen der Heideentstehung und -entwicklung zu nennen Hmm - ich denke, Plaggenwirtschaft und Abbrennen wären vielleicht ein Extrakapitel wert mit dem Thema Heidebauernwirtschaft'' ... --&gt;
After the end of the [[Weichselian Ice Age]] (115,000 to 10,000 years ago) the first woods appeared in the area that now forms the Lüneburg Heath which, following the natural [[ecological succession]] and encouraged by a gradual improvement in the climate, progressed from [[birch]] and [[pine trees|pine forest]] through [[hazel]] woods to light woods of [[sessile oak]]s.

The heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the [[North German Plain]] in which the hunter culture of the [[Mesolithic]] era was superseded quite early on by [[Neolithic]] farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the [[New Stone Age]], large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of [[Geest (topography)|geest]] on the Lüneburg Heath. This was a result of the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the [[Common Heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris''), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over a long period of time the region of the Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the [[migration period]], the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Ellenberg: ''Vegetation Mitteleuropas mit den Alpen in ökologischer, dynamischer und historischer Sicht'', Stuttgart 1996, p. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until after 1000 AD does the [[pollen analysis]] show a continuous reduction in the woodlands and a considerable increase in [[Calluna|heather]]. This was brought about by a change from nomadic farming to settled farming with permanent settlements. The typical heath farming economy emerged: due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields, from which grain, in particular, could be produced. This was achieved by the regular removal of the turf (a method known as ''[[Plaggen]]''), which  was used as hay for the pens of the moorland sheep, the ''[[Heidschnucke]]n''. This was then enriched with the manure and urine of the sheep – and spread over the fields as fertiliser.

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide - 043.jpg|thumb|left|Path near [[Undeloh]]]]
[[Image:Bodenprofil Heide.jpg|thumb|Soil profile of heath podsol showing the [[hardpan]]]]
By cutting the turf the regenerative capacity of the soils was exhausted. The regular removal of the top layer of soil contributed to the spreading of heathland. As heather decomposes, the [[pH value]] of the soil falls drastically, as far as the iron buffer-region at pH 3, which initiates the process of [[podsolisation]]. Soil life is severely damaged, which results in a hard layer of earth underneath the root zone on the heath at a depth of about {{convert|40|cm|in}}. The iron and humus particles released by the topsoil precipitate onto this impervious [[hardpan]]. The subsoil thus separates itself from the topsoil. The nutrients are largely washed out of the topsoil which leads to leaching and causes the typical grey-white coloration of the paths on the heath.

The oft-expressed view in the literature that the heath arose in the [[Middle Ages]] as a result of the demand for wood by the  Lüneburg [[Salt evaporation pond|salt pan]]s is incorrect. The Lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of [[table salt|salt]], but they did not appear until around 1000 AD, by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years.. The amount required, even in the heyday of production, could have been continuously supplied by an area of woodland about 50&amp;nbsp;km² in area, yet the heath covers over 7000&amp;nbsp;km². In any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath, but via the waterways, especially from [[Mecklenburg]] up the Elbe and from the area of the [[Schaalsee]]. Transportation overland would have been far too expensive (apart from the [[River Ilmenau]] which was navigable at the time, no rivers flow from the main areas of heathland to Lüneburg), as can be seen not only from some of the delivery notes which still survive, but also from the fact that there are still large woods around Lüneburg itself, such as the [[Göhrde]]. Finally heathland has frequentely developed in areas where there are no salt pans, such as the sheep-grazing regions on the coasts of Norway to Portugal and in Scotland and Ireland.

[[Image:Steingrund 009.jpg|thumb|Herd of ''[[Heidschnucke]]n'' (moorland sheep)]]
The heath is not therefore a [[natural landscape]], but a [[cultural landscape]] created by the intervention of man. In order to prevent its semi-open heathland from being repopulated by trees, especially [[pine]]s and, to a lesser extent, [[silver birch]]es, which would cause the loss of this millennia-old environment and its many inhabitants, including often very rare animal and plant species, sheep are allowed to graze it regularly; these are almost exclusively the local German moorland sheep, the ''[[Heidschnucke]]''.

=== Plant population / Phytocenosis ===
In the 20th century numerous conservation measures were implemented on the Lüneburg Heath; as a result it is one of the best researched regions of central Europe.

==== Heathland ====
Sand heaths form about 20% of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve and may be broken down into further sub-divisions, the most important being:

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 096.jpg|thumb|Typical sandy heath near Wilsede]]

;Ordinary sand heath (''Typische Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum)
*In addition to the [[Common Heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris'') only a few taller plants occur here, none of which can be classed as characteristic species. Amongst them are the [[Wavy Hair-grass]] (''Deschampsia flexuosa'') and [[Common juniper]] (''Juniperus communis''). Ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types. Its proportion has increased in recent decades at the expense of other heath habitats. This reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air, the increase in plant litter (''Rohhumusauflagen'') and the natural ageing of the heathland.

;Lichen-rich sand heath (''Flechtenreiche Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum cladonietosum)
*The lichen-rich sand heaths can be told apart from the other types of heathland by the presence of various [[Cladonia|cup lichens]] (''[[Cladonia]]''), [[Marchantiophyta|Ciliated fringewort]] (''Ptilidium ciliare'') and [[Polytrichaceae|Juniper Haircap]] (''Polytrichum juniperinum''). They occur frequently on dry, south-facing slopes. This type of heath is found west of Niederhaverbeck and near Sundermühlen.

;Clay heath (''Lehmheide'', Genisto-callunetum danthonietusum)
*This can be identified by the presence of [[Danthonia decumbens|Heath Grass]] (''Danthonia decumbens''), [[Carex pilulifera|Pill Sedge]] (''Carex pilulifera''), [[Mat grass]] (''Nardus stricta''), [[List of the vascular plants of Britain and Ireland 8|Fine-leaved Sheep's-fescue]] (''Festuca filiformis''), [[Mouse-ear Hawkweed]] (''Hieracium pilosella'') and [[Field Wood-rush]] (''Luzula campestris''). Clay heaths have become very rare within the Lüneburg Heath. They are found on the [[Wilseder Berg]] and south of Niederhaverbeck.

;Blueberry sand heath (''Heidelbeer-Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum, Vaccinium myrtillus Rasse)
*[[Blueberry|Blueberries]] (''Vaccinium myrtillus'') are the signature species of this type of heath and, more rarely,  [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cranberries]] (''Vaccinium vitis-idaea''). Blueberry heath is the second most common type of vegetation on the heathlands and occurs especially on northern slopes, the edges of woods and thick juniper hedges. This type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the [[Wilseder Berg]], as well as the Steingrund and Totengrund. In those places cranberries have even ousted the [[Calluna|common heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris'') in places.

;Wet sand heath (''Feuchte Sandheide'', Genisto-Callunetum, Molinia-Variante)
*Wet sand heath is the ideal habitat for [[Purple Moor Grass]] (''Molinia caerulea''), [[Cross-leaved Heath]] (''Erica tetralix'') und [[Scirpus ]] (''Scirpus cespitosus''). It occurs in places close to the water table and in the transition zone around bogs. Its primary locations are areas north of Wilsede and near the Hörpel Ponds (''Hörpeler Teichen'').&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Herrmann Cordes u.a.: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Bremen 1997, S. 163ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Woods ====
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 073.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pine forest near Schneverdingen]]
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide - Hutewald 001.jpg|thumb|The ''Hutewald'' ([[wood pasture]]) near Wilsede]]
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 011.jpg|thumb|Old coppices (''Stühbüsche'') near Niederhaverbeck]]
The greater part (about 58%) of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve consists of woods, primarily [[pine]] [[forest]]s, which were planted in the second half of the 19th century on former heathland and drifting sand. In some cases the dunes simply became naturally overgrown, again with pines. There are only a very few old stands of [[sessile oak]]s, which stem from the logging industry during the time of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. In many parts of the nature reserve there are so-called ''Stühbüsche'' (a form of coppice), trees that were coppiced by repeatedly being cut short. In the meantime they have grown wild again and have a characteristic and unusual appearance with their multiple trunks. Near [[Bispingen|Wilsede]] there is the remnant of a ''[[Hutewald]]'' - a wood pasture with giant, multi-stemmed [[beech tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Herrmann Cordes u.a.: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Bremen 1997, p. 113ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bogs ====
The largest bog on the Lüneburg Heath is the [[Pietzmoor]], which lies east of [[Schneverdingen]]. It was drained however and peat was cut there until the 1960s. The Nature Park Association carried out work in the 1980s to try and turn it back to its natural waterlogged state. For example, some of the drainage ditches were filled which led to a considerable rise in the water levels of the former peat cuts. However typical bog vegetation has not yet re-established itself.&lt;ref&gt;VNP–Schriften 1: ''14 Jahre Naturschutzgroßprojekt Lüneburger Heide.'' Niederhaverbeck 2007, S. 92ff&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
Many species of animal live on the terrain of the Lüneburg Heath, particularly birds that are at home in the wide, open landscape, some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas. These include the: [[Black Grouse]] (''Tetrao tetrix''), the [[Nightjar]] (''Caprimulgus europaeus''), the [[Woodlark]] (''Lullula arborea''), the [[Great Grey Shrike]] (''Lanius excubitor''), the [[Red-backed Shrike]] (''Lanius collurio''), the [[Northern Wheatear]] (''Oenanthe oenanthe''), the [[Wryneck]] (''Jynx torquilla''), the [[European Green Woodpecker]] (''Picus viridis''), the [[African Stonechat|Stonechat]] (''Saxicola torquata''), the [[Eurasian Curlew]] (''Numenius arquata''), the [[Common Quail]] (''Coturnix coturnix'') and the [[Black Stork]] (''Ciconia nigra'').&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Kleinburg, Johannes Prüter: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Schneverdingen 2006, p. 22ff und Herrmann Cordes u.a.: ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' Bremen 1997, p. 209ff&lt;/ref&gt; In the Lüneburg Heath the population of the very rare Black Grouse is rising continually. In 2007 78 were counted, 13 more than in the previous year. Since 2003 the number of grouse has doubled.
Numerous species including [[European Bison]], [[Moose]] and [[Brown Bear]] which once inhabited the region may be seen in the [[Lüneburg Heath Wildlife Park]] alongside more exotic animals like [[snow leopard]]s and [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]].

== Culture and history ==

[[Image:Siebensteinhaeuser grab d-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Sieben Steinhäuser'', Grave D]]
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide - Hügelgräber 001.jpg|thumb|Tumuli on the Lüneburg Heath]]

=== Early history ===
[[Palynology|Pollen analyses]] show that the dry geest soils of North Germany have been cultivated since about 3000 BC. Clearance by fire and the cultivation of crops on the [[Pleistocene]] sandy soils quickly led however to [[soil degradation]]. So the land cleared by fire could only be used for a short time. The settlements moved frequently and woods elsewhere were cleared. Even at that time the first [[Calluna]] (heather) heaths appeared (see above).&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Hansjörg Küster: ''Geschichte der Landschaft in Mitteleuropa.'' p. 101ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of relatively dense settlement is found especially in [[Uelzen district]]. On the terrain of the Lüneburg Heath there are numerous [[Megalithic]] sites and [[tumuli]] from the [[New Stone Age]] and the early [[Bronze Age]]. The most famous are the ''[[Oldendorfer Totenstatt]]'' (&quot;Oldendorf Gravesite&quot;) and the ''[[Sieben Steinhäuser]]'' (&quot;Seven Stone Houses&quot;). But even in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve there are more than a thousand tumuli, especially near Nieder- and Oberhaverbeck. The largest of these tumuli is the so-called Prince's Grave (''Fürstengrab''). Near Wilsede there is also a well-known stone and juniper group with the name ''Hannibal's Grave'' (''Hannibals Grab'').&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Herrmann Cordes u.a. (Hrsg.): ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide'', p. 49ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transition to settlement culture ===
After the withdrawal of the [[Lombards]] during the [[migration period]] the Lüneburg Heath belonged to the [[Duchy of Saxony]] from about 700 AD, which was conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century and became part of the [[Frankish Empire]]. The resulting close control of the population and the [[Christianization]] meant that the rural settlements had to stay in one place and could no longer move about freely. The land had to be more intensively farmed which led to the heathland spreading.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Hansjörg Küster: ''Geschichte der Landschaft in Mitteleuropa.'' S. 163ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Settlements ===
[[Image:Dat ole Hus 003.jpg|thumb|The Wilsede Heath Museum – a typical timber-framed hall house ''([[Fachhallenhaus]]'')]]
[[Image:Wilsede 007.jpg|thumb|left|Field and woods near Wilsede]]
[[Image:Wilsede 004.jpg|thumb|left|Wilsede – walled village streets]]
The Lüneburg Heath was always relatively sparsely populated due to the poor soils in the area. The region was dominated by heath farming which was a less intensive form of land usage necessary for its large areas of barren terrain and heathland. An important economic sideline of past centuries was heathland [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref&gt;see also: [[Naturpark Südheide#Heideimkerei|Heath beekeeping in Südheide Nature Park]]&lt;/ref&gt; The villages were usually encircled by small tracts of woodland, sometimes interrupted by fields or meadows, and merged without clear boundaries into the surrounding landscape. The farmsteads were arranged relatively arbitrarily, many stood very close to one another; others were spread out at some distance from each other. They were loose cluster villages (''lockere Haufendörfer''). In order to prevent cattle trampling flat the gardens attached to the houses, village roads were enclosed with wooden fences and, later, with characteristic stone walls. The typical design of farmhouse was the ''[[Fachhallenhaus]]'', a large timber-framed single building, in which people and animals lived under a single roof. Each village had relatively few complete farms; in [[Bispingen|Wilsede]] there were only four, in the church village (''Kirchdorf'') of [[Undeloh]] there were eleven, but that was an exception. In addition there were ''Koten'' (small, single houses), sheep pens and shared bakehouses. The farms themselves, however, were very large. In Wilsede all the features of a heath village described here may still be seen. The [[Wilsede Heath Museum]] (''Heidemuseum Wilsede'') was established in a ''[[Fachhallenhaus]]'' and it gives an insight into the working and living conditions of a heathland farm around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Herrmann Cordes u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Naturschutzgebiet Lüneburger Heide.'' S. 73ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rischmannshof Heath Museum|Walsrode Heath Museum]] was one of the first German open air museums and also portrays the life of heathland folk. In rural parts of the region they still sometimes use today a [[Low German]] dialect called ''Heidjerisch''. This word derives from the name given to inhabitants of the Lüneburg Heath – the ''Heidjer''.

=== Heath convents ===
In the Lüneburg Heath region six [[nunneries]] from the [[Middle Ages]] survived, which became Protestant convents after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

=== The end of heathland farming in the 19th century ===
[[Image:Totengrund 001.jpg|thumb|left|Totengrund]]
[[Image:Lüneburger Heide - 071.jpg|thumb|Pine forest]]
From 1831 [[feudalism]] was abolished in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] and those heathland areas that were [[common land]] for the villages were divided amongst the individual farmers. Heathland farming died out at the end of the 19th century. Many farmers sold their land to the [[Prussian]] [[treasury]] or the Hanover monastic chamber, who afforested the land with pines. As a result the area of heath was drastically reduced.

In 1800 large parts of Northwest Germany were covered with heaths and bog. Today, by contrast the only large, continuous areas of heath remaining are in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve and on a few [[military training area]]s.

=== Landscape perception in the course of time ===
As late as the turn of the 18th/19th century the barren and almost treeless heathlands were still perceived as hostile and threatening environments, as evinced by two travel logs of journeys between 1799 and 1804:

{{quotation|''As I had traversed the Hanoverian dominions in so many directions, I did not expect to find nature clothed in charms, or a high degree of population, fertility, and cultivation. Next to Lauenburg, I think it is the worst tract of an equal extent that I ever met with. The soil is one vast sandy desert, which is either naturally bare, or covered with patches of heath or grass.''}} (Charles Gottlob Küttner: ''Travels through Denmark, Sweden, Austria, and part of Italy, in 1798 &amp; 1799. London 1805)&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the German. [http://books.google.de/books?id=yphAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA199 p. 199 books.google]. German original: &quot;Da ich die Hannöverschen Lande in so vielen Richtungen durchwandert habe, so war ich gewiß nicht vorbereitet, eine schöne Natur, Fruchtbarkeit, starke Bevölkerung und hohen Anbau zu erwarten;  aber ich dachte nicht, daß es so gar elend wäre. Mich dünkt, es ist, nebst dem Lauenburgischen, der schlechteste Strich von einem solchen Umfange, der mir je vorgekommen ist. Der Boden dieses ganzen Landes ist eine ungeheure Sandwüste, die von Natur entweder ganz nackt ist, oder Heidekraut, oder dünn verstreute , stechende Grashalmen hervorbringt.&quot; Karl Gottlob Küttner: ''Reise durch Deutschland, Dänemark, Schweden, Norwegen und einen Theil von Italien in den Jahren 1797, 1798, 1799.

Whole families, of the most wretched appearance, and covered with tattered garments, associate together, eat and sleep with their cattle. Near these real catacombs we observed growing a few stalks of rye and barley, and here and there a few tufu of buck-wheat. The straw is short and stunted, and the ears of a diminutive size.

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 055.jpg|thumb|Lüneburg Heath]]

The poem ''Der Heideknabe'' (&quot;The Heath Lad&quot;) from the year 1844 by [[Friedrich Hebbel]] stresses the unearthly atmosphere and the bleak solitude of the heaths:

{{quotation|'':(...) Out, out of the town! And there it stretches,
:''The heath, misty, ghostly,''
:''The wind swishing over it,''
:''Oh, every step here is like a thousand others!''

:''And all so still, and all so quiet,''
:''You look around for signs of life,''
:''Only hungry birds dart by''
:''Out of the clouds, to spear worms (...).''}}

Towards the middle of the 19th century the first positive descriptions of the heath emerged, initially inspired by the [[romanticism|romantic]] movement. With the [[industrial revolution]] in Germany, unspoilt nature was even more important for people, providing a welcome contrast with the rapidly burgeoning cities. Because the heathlands of North Germany were being increasingly decimated by cultivation and reforestation, they now appeared to be worth protecting. Numerous writers and painters portrayed the beauty of the heath, particularly when it was in bloom in August and September. One important heathland artist was Eugen Bracht. And the most famous heath poet was the local writer [[Hermann Löns]] (1866–1914), who spent some time living in a hunting lodge near [[Westenholz]]. He worked the heath countryside into his books and promoted the foundation of the first German [[nature reserve]] on the Lüneburg Heide. He was buried in a juniper copse at Tietlingen near Walsrode in 1934. His works were a source for [[Heimatfilm|homeland films]] (''Heimatfilme'') that were produced in the Lüneburg Heath, such as ''Grün ist die Heide'' (&quot;Green is the Heath&quot;) from 1932 and its 1951 remake, as well as ''Rot ist die Liebe'' (&quot;Red is Love&quot;) from 1956.

=== History of conservation in the Lüneburg Heath ===
Around 1900 there were growing demands to save the heathland and bogs of northwest Germany, which were threatened by reforestation and drainage. On the Lüneburg Heath Wilhelm Bode, then the [[pastor]] at [[Egestorf]], was particularly active in pressing for the preservation of the endangered countryside. He had learned in 1905 of plans for building weekend houses on the Totengrund. In order to prevent this, he persuaded Prof. Dr. Andreas Thomsen from [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]] to acquired the area as a nature reserve. In 1909 Pastor Bode and district administrator (''Landrat'') Fritz Ecker prevented the planned afforestation of the [[Wilseder Berg]].

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 1960 002.jpg|thumb|left|Totengrund around 1960]]
In the same year an appeal by Dr. Curt Floerike appeared in Kosmos magazine – citing the situation in the [[United States|USA]] – for [[national park]]s to be founded in Germany. In order to realise this goal, the Nature Park Society (''Verein Naturschutzpark (VNP)'') was founded in [[Munich]] on 23 October 1909. They planned to create [[national park]]s in the [[Alps]], the [[Central Uplands]] and in the north German [[Geest (topography)|geest]] region. By 1913 the society already had 13,000 members with their associated membership income and donations.

The Lüneburg Heath near [[Bispingen|Wilsede]] was selected as the location for the north German national park. Using the VNP's funds, more than 30&amp;nbsp;km² of heathland were purchased or rented by 1913. In 1921 a police ordinance placed more than 200&amp;nbsp;km² of the Lüneburg Heath under protection, the first time this had been achieved in Germany. One problem that arose as early as the 1920s was the steadily increasing number of visitors. In 1924, in order to keep visitors away from sensitive areas of heathland, the Heath Guard (''Heidewacht'') – a volunteer body – was founded.

The Reich conservation law was passed in 1933, during the [[Nazi era]]. The Lüneburg Heath was now designated as an official nature reserve. In the years that followed the society was able to prevent plans for a motorway to be built through the park and for the heath to be used as a [[military training area]]. In 1933 the ''Heidewacht'' was disbanded, mainly because it was made up of members of social-democratic youth organisations. In 1939 the society passed a new law that granted the chairmen – now called ''Führer''s – wide-ranging powers. [[Jew]]s could no longer be members of the society.

[[Image:Lüneburger Heide 1960 003.jpg|thumb|Tank tracks near Wilsede]]
Between 1891 and the [[Second World War]] large military training areas were established on the Lüneburg Heath, including the largest one in Europe, the [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area]] on the ''Südheide''. Here the heathland has largely been preserved, albeit no longer accessible to the general public.

A large area of the nature park belonging to the society near [[Schneverdingen]] was taken over by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in 1945 for use as a tank training area. In the 1950s, during military exercises, British tanks even pushed forward as far as the  Wilseder Berg. Not until the [[Soltau-Lüneburg Agreement]], was signed in 1959 between the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]], were the boundaries of the tank training area fixed. Continual exercising over the area by armoured vehicles completely destroyed the vegetation on the Osterheide near [[Schneverdingen]], forming large areas of sand dunes. In 1994 the British returned the so-called &quot;Red Areas&quot; of the [[Soltau-Lüneburg Training Area]] to the Nature Park Society who, with the help of money from the federal government, set about the work of renaturation. Nowadays hardly any traces of the tank training area are left. The base camp for military exercises, [[Reinsehlen Camp]], has been turned into a nature reserve.

=== Forest fire ===
In August 1975 fire broke out on the [[Südheide Nature Park|''Südheide'']] which turned out to be the biggest forest fire in West Germany to that date.
Serious forest fires broke out in the southern part of the area near [[Sassenburg-Stüde|Stüde]], [[Neudorf-Platendorf]], [[Meinersen]] and then by [[Eschede]] near [[Celle]], which due to their devastating effect and fatalities became known as the [[Fire on the Lüneburg Heath|forest fire disaster on the Lüneburg Heath]].

== German surrender at the end of World War II ==
The heath was the scene of the [[unconditional surrender]] of [[German surrender at Lüneburg Heath|German forces in Holland, in north west Germany including all islands, and in Denmark and all naval ships in those areas]], to the Allies under [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], on May 4, 1945, at the [[end of World War II in Europe]]. It is also the area where the body of [[Heinrich Himmler]], a leading figure in [[Nazi Germany]] and head of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], was secretly buried in an [[unmarked grave]], following his [[suicide]].

== Transportation ==
=== Road ===
Three motorways (''[[Autobahn]]en'') run across the Lüneburg Heath, the  [[Bundesautobahn 7|A 7]], [[Bundesautobahn 27|A 27]] and [[Bundesautobahn 250|A 250]], as well as various federal roads, the [[Bundesstraße 3|B 3]], [[Bundesstraße 71|B 71]], [[Bundesstraße 440|B 440]] and others.

=== Railways ===
The Lüneburg Heath is served by the following [[railway]] lines:
* The [[Hanover–Hamburg railway]]: [[Hamburg]]–[[Lüneburg]]–[[Uelzen]]–[[Celle]]–[[Hanover]]
* The [[Wanne-Eickel–Hamburg railway|''Rollbahn'']]: [[Hamburg]]–[[Buchholz in der Nordheide]]–[[Rotenburg (Wümme)]]–[[Bremen]]
* The [[Heath Railway]] (''Heidebahn''): (Hamburg)–Buchholz in der Nordheide–[[Soltau]]–[[Bad Fallingbostel]]–[[Walsrode]]–Bennemühlen–Hanover
* The [[Uelzen–Langwedel railway]]: Bremen–[[Visselhövede]]–Soltau–[[Munster (Örtze)|Munster]]–Uelzen
* The [[Brunswick–Uelzen railway]]: Uelzen–[[Wieren]]–[[Wittingen]]–[[Gifhorn]]–[[Braunschweig]]
* The [[East Hanoverian Railways]] (''[[Osthannoversche Eisenbahnen]]'' or ''OHE'') maintains a railway network, the greater part of which lies in the Lüneburg Heath (only for freight and museum services and sometimes the [[Heath Express]] (''Heide-Express'').

== Important towns ==
* [[Amelinghausen]]
* [[Bad Fallingbostel]]
* [[Bispingen]]
* [[Buchholz in der Nordheide]]
* [[Celle]]
* [[Gifhorn]]
* [[Lüneburg]]
* [[Munster (Örtze)|Munster]]
* [[Schneverdingen]]
* [[Soltau]]
* [[Uelzen]]
* [[Walsrode]]

== Tourism ==
Today the area is a popular tourist destination. Contributing to this are the theme park, ''[[Heidepark Soltau]]'', the [[Walsrode Bird Park]] and the [[Serengeti Park|Serengeti Safari Park]] at Hodenhagen as well as the many farms offering holiday stays, making the Lüneburg Heath especially attractive to families. Another group of tourists are the elderly on free guided bus tours (''Kaffeefahrten''), stopping for coffee and wool plaids at a farm before touring Lüneburg for an hour.

The '''Zugspitze''', at 2,962&amp;nbsp;metres above [[Normalhöhennull|sea level]], is the highest peak of the [[Wetterstein Mountains]] as well as the highest [[mountain]] in [[Germany]]. It lies south of the town of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], and the border between Germany and Austria runs over its western summit. South of the mountain is the ''Zugspitzplatt'', a high [[karst]] [[plateau]] with numerous caves. On the flanks of the Zugspitze are three glaciers, including the two largest in Germany: the [[Schneeferner#Northern Schneeferner|Northern Schneeferner]] with an area of 30.7 [[hectare]]s and the [[Höllentalferner]] with an area of 24.7 hectares. The third is the [[Schneeferner#Southern Schneeferner|Southern Schneeferner]] which covers 8.4 hectares.

The Zugspitze was first conquered on 27 August 1820 by [[Josef Naus]], his survey assistant, Maier, and [[mountain guide]], Johann Georg Tauschl. Today there are three normal routes to the summit: one from the [[Höllental (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] valley to the northeast; another out of the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley to the southeast; and the third from the west over the Austrian Cirque (''Österreichische Schneekar''). One of the best known ridge routes in the [[Eastern Alps]] runs along the knife-edged Jubilee Ridge (''[[Jubiläumsgrat]]'') to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the [[Hochblassen]] and the [[Alpspitze]]. For mountaineers there is plenty of accommodation in the vicinity. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the [[Münchner Haus]] and on the western slopes is the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]].

Three [[cable cars]] run to the top of the Zugspitze. The first, the [[Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car]], was built in 1926 and terminated on an arête below the summit before the terminus was moved to the actual summit in 1991. A [[rack railway]], the [[Bavarian Zugspitze Railway]], runs inside the northern flank of the mountain and ends on the ''Zugspitzplatt'', from where a second cable car takes passengers to the top. The rack railway and the [[Eibsee Cable Car]], the third cableway, transport an average of 500,000 people to the summit each year. In winter, nine [[ski lift]]s cover the [[ski area]] on the ''Zugspitzplatt''. The weather station, opened in 1900, and the research station in the [[Schneefernerhaus]] are mainly used to conduct climate research.

== Geography ==
The Zugspitze belongs to the [[Wetterstein]] range of the [[Northern Limestone Alps]]. The [[border]] between Germany and Austria goes right over the mountain. There used to be a border checkpoint at the summit. But since Germany and Austria are now both part of the [[Schengen zone]], the border crossing is no longer manned.

The exact height of the Zugspitze was a matter of debate for quite a while. Given figures ranged from {{convert|2690|-|2970|m|ft}}, but it is now generally accepted that the peak is {{convert|2962|m|ft|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]] as a result of a survey carried out by the Bavarian State Survey Office. The lounge at the new café is named &quot;2962&quot; for this reason.

=== Location ===
[[File:ZugspitzeJubilaeumsgratHoellental.JPG|right|thumb|View from the [[Alpspitze]] of the Zugspitze summit and the [[Höllentalferner]] glacier in 2007]]
At {{convert|2962|m|ft}} (eastern peak) the Zugspitze is the highest mountain of the Zugspitze massif. This height is referenced to the [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum|Amsterdam Gauge]] and is given by the [[Bavarian State Office for Survey and Geoinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.zugspitze.de/diebzb/pdf_ulpr/Zugspitze-Hoehe.pdf |titel=Zugspitze XXL:Deutschlands höchster Berg zeigt seine wahre Größe|autor=Eva-Maria Greimel |hrsg=Presseinformation Bayerische Zugspitzbahn Bergbahn AG | format= PDF | zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same height is recorded against the [[Metres above the Adriatic|Trieste Gauge]] used in Austria, which is 27&amp;nbsp;cm lower. Originally the Zugspitze had three [[Summit (topography)|peaks]]: the east, middle and west summits (''Ost-, Mittel-'' and ''Westgipfel''). The only one that has remained in its original form is the east summit, which is also the only one that lies entirely on German territory. The middle summit fell victim to one of the cable car summit stations in 1930. In 1938 the west summit was blown up to create a building site for a planned flight control room for the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. This was never built however. Originally the height of the west summit was given as {{convert|2964|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHiebeler|Hiebeler (1985)]], p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zugspitze rises eleven kilometres southwest of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and just under six kilometres east of [[Ehrwald]]. The border between Germany and Austria runs over the west summit; thus the Zugspitze massif belongs to the German state of [[Bavaria]] and the Austrian state of [[Tyrol (Bundesland)|Tyrol]]. The municipalities responsible for it are [[Grainau]] and [[Ehrwald]]. To the west the Zugspitze massif drops into the valley of the River [[Loisach]], which flows around the massif towards the northeast in a curve whilst, in the east, the streams of ''Hammersbach'' and [[Partnach]] have their source. To the south the ''Gaistal'' valley and its river, the [[Leutascher Ache]], separate the Wetterstein Mountains from the [[Mieming Chain]]. To the north at the foot of the Zugspitze is the lake of [[Eibsee]]. The next highest mountain in the area is the [[Acherkogel]] ({{convert|3008|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the [[Stubai Alps]], which gives the Zugspitze an [[topographic isolation]] value of 24.6&amp;nbsp;kilometres. The reference point for the [[prominence]] is the [[Parseierspitze]] ({{convert|3036|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). In order to climb it from the Zugspitze, a descent to the [[Fern Pass]] ({{convert|1216|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) is required, so that the prominence is {{convert|1746|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10012 |titel=Zugspitze |autor= |hrsg=peakbagger.com| sprache=en|zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Zugspitze Massif
[[File:Zugspitze-Luftbild.JPG|right|thumb|Annotated aerial photograph of the Zugspitze massif]]
The [[massif]] of the Zugspitze has several other peaks. To the south the ''Zugspitzplatt'' is surrounded in an arc by the ''Zugspitzeck'' ({{convert|2820|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Schneefernerkopf]] ({{convert|2874|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Wetterspitzen]] ({{convert|2747|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Wetterwandeck]] ({{convert|2698|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Plattspitzen]] ({{convert|2679|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the ''Gatterlköpfen'' ({{convert|2490|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The massif ends int the ''Gatterl'' ({{convert|2024|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), a [[wind gap (geographical feature)|wind gap]] between it and the [[Hochwanner]]. Running eastwards away from the Zugspitze is the famous Jubilee Ridge or ''Jubiläumsgrat'' over the [[Höllentalspitzen]] towards the [[Alpspitze]] and [[Hochblassen]]. The short crest of the ''Riffelwandkamm'' runs northeast over the summits of the [[Riffelwandspitzen]] ({{convert|2626|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the ''Riffelköpfe'' ({{convert|2459|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), to the Riffel wind gap (''Riffelscharte'', {{convert|2161|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). From here the ridge of the ''Waxensteinkamm'' stretches away over the [[Riffelspitzen]] to the [[Waxenstein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alpenvereinskarte&quot;&gt;''[[Alpine Club Map]] 4/2 – Wetterstein und Mieminger Gebirge Mitte'' (1:25,000). 5th edition.

;Zugspitzplatt
[[File:Zugspitze-Wettersteinkamm.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Zugspitzplatt'' above the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley in 2006]]
The ''Platt'' or ''Zugspitzplatt'' is a [[plateau]] below the summit of the Zugspitze to the south and southeast which lies at a height of between {{convert|2000|and|2650|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It forms the head of the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley and has been shaped by a combination of [[weathering]], [[karst]]ification and [[glaciation]]. The area contains [[roches moutonnée]]s, [[Sinkhole|dolines]] and [[limestone pavement]]s as a consequence of the [[ice age]]s. In addition [[moraine]]s have been left behind by various [[glacial period]]s. The ''Platt'' was completely covered by a glacier for the last time at the beginning of the 19th century. Today 52% of it consists of [[scree]], 32% of [[bedrock]] and 16% of vegetation-covered soils, especially in the middle and lower areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umweltgeol-he.de/WerdenfelserGeotope.Wetterstein.ZugspitzplattUndPlattumrahmung.htm |title=Zugspitzplatt und Plattumrahmung |author=Engelbrecht, Hubert |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
From a climatic perspective the Zugspitze lies in the [[temperate zone]] and its prevailing winds are [[Westerlies]]. As the first high [[orographic]] obstacle to these Westerlies in the Alps, the Zugspitze is particularly exposed to the weather. It is effectively the north barrier of the Alps (''Nordstau der Alpen''), against which moist air masses pile up and release heavy precipitation. At the same time the Zugspitze acts as protective barrier for parts of the Alps to the south. By contrast, [[Föhn]] weather conditions push in the other direction against the massif, affecting the region for about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. These  warm, dry air masses stream from south to north and can result in unusually high temperatures in winter. Nevertheless frost dominates the picture on the Zugspitze with an average of 310&amp;nbsp;days per year. The nearest place with comparable values is the island of [[Spitsbergen]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]].

In: ''[[Südkurier]]'' dated 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest measured temperature on the Zugspitze was -35.6&amp;nbsp;°C in 14 February 1940. The highest temperature occurred on 5 July 1957 when the thermometer reached 17.9&amp;nbsp;°C. A [[squall]] on 12 June 1985 registered 335&amp;nbsp;km/h, the highest measured wind speed on the Zugspitze.

Nowadays, snow completely melts during summer, but in the past snow might resist the summer months, the last case when the snow failed to melt during the whole summer season was in 2000.

=== Geology ===
[[File:Zugspitze 1.jpg|right|thumb|The north face of the Zugspitze seen from the [[Eibsee]] lake]]
All mountain-building strata consists of [[sedimentary rock]]s of the [[Mesozoic]] era, that were originally laid down on the seabed. The base of the mountain comprises [[muschelkalk]] beds; its upper layers are made of [[Wetterstein limestone]]. With steep rock walls up to 800&amp;nbsp;metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper [[Triassic]] that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algea in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-while and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains [[lead]] and [[zinc]] ore. These [[mineral]]s were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the [[Höllental (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from the foot of the Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze it can be seen that this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled on top of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Beulke: ''Alpenvereinsführer Wetterstein''. 4th edition. [[Bergverlag Rother]], Munich 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;20ff, ISBN 978-3-7633-1119-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flora ===
The flora on the Zugspitze is not particularly diverse due to the soil conditions, nevertheless the vegetation, especially in the meadows of ''Schachen'', the ''Tieferen Wies'' near Ehrwald, and in the valleys of Höllental, Gaistal and Leutaschtal is especially colourful.

[[File:Eibsee &amp; Zugspitze.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Eibsee]] in front of the Zugspitze: woods on the northern shore]]
The shaded and moist northern slopes of the massif like, for example, the [[Naturwaldreservat Wettersteinwald|Wettersteinwald]], are some of the most species-rich environments on the Zugspitze. The [[Mountain Pine]] grows at elevations of up to  1,800&amp;nbsp;metres. The woods lower down consist mainly of [[Spruce]] and [[Fir]], but [[Honeysuckle]], [[Galium odoratum|Woodruff]],  poisonous [[Herb Paris]], [[Meadow-rue]] and [[Speedwell]]{{disambiguation needed|date=October 2011}} also occur here. [[Dark Columbine]], [[Alpine Clematis]], Blue and Yellow [[Monkshood]], [[Stemless carline thistle]], [[False aster]], [[Golden cinquefoil]], [[Round-leaved saxifrage]], [[Wall hawkweed]], [[Alpine calamint]] and [[Alpine Forget-me-not]] flower in the less densely wooded places, whilst [[Cinquefoil]], [[Sticky Sage]], [[Butterbur]], [[Alpenrose]], [[Turk's cap lily]] and [[Fly Orchid]] thrive on the rocky soils of the mountain forests. [[Lily of the Valley]] and [[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]] also occur, especially in the Höllental, in Grainau and by the Eibsee.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPfanzelt|Pfanzelt (1966)]], p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south the scene changes to [[Larch]] (mainly in the meadow of ''Ehrwalder Alm'' and the valleys of Gaistal and Leutaschtal) and [[pine]] forests and into mixed woods of [[Beech]] and [[Sycamore]]. Here too, Mountain Pine grows at the higher elevations of over 2,000&amp;nbsp;metres.

Relatively rare in the entire Zugspitze area are trees like the [[Lime (tree)|Lime]], [[Birch]], [[Rowan]], [[Juniper]] and [[Taxus baccata|Yew]]. The most varied species of [[moss]], that often completely cover limestone rocks in the open, occur in great numbers.

[[Bilberry]], [[Cranberry]] and [[Cowberry]] are restricted to dry places and [[Lady's Slipper Orchid]] occurs in sheltered spots. Below the [[Waxenstein]] are fields with [[raspberries]] and occasionally wild [[strawberries]] too. The [[Alpine poppy]] and [[Purple mountain saxifrage]] both thrive up to a very great height. On the scree slops there are [[Thlaspi|Penny-cress]] and [[Mouse-ear chickweed]] as well as [[Mountain avens]], [[Alpine toadflax]], [[Lamiaceae|Mint]] and [[Saxifraga|Musky Saxifrage or Cloth of Gold]]. Following snowmelt [[Sedum|Dark stonecrop]] and [[Snow gentian]] are the first to appear, their seeds beginning to germinate as early as August. And well-known Alpine flowers like the [[Edelweiss]], [[Gentiana|Gentian]]s and, more rarely, [[Cyclamen]] flower on the Zugspitze.

=== Fauna ===
[[File:Alpen Zugspitze Alpendohle 2.jpg|thumb|Alpine choughs on the ''Zugspitzeck'']]
The rocks around the Zugspitze are a habitat for [[Chamois]] and [[Marmot]]s are widespread on the southern side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently [[Alpine Chough]]s, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are [[Mountain Hare]] and the [[Hazel Dormouse]]. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the [[Golden Eagle]], [[Rock Ptarmigan]], [[Snow Finch]], [[Alpine Accentor]] and [[Brambling]]. The [[Eurasian Crag Martin|Crag Martin]] which has given its name to the ''Schwalbenwand'' (&quot;Swallows' Wall&quot;) at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.

The [[Viviparous lizard]] inhabits rocky terrain, as does the black [[Alpine Salamander]] known locally as the ''Bergmandl'', which can be seen after rain showers as one is climbing. Butterflies like [[Apollo (butterfly)|Apollo]], Alpine Perlmutter, [[Lycaenidae|Gossamer-winged butterfly]], [[Geometer moth]], [[Erebia|Ringlet]] and [[Skipper (butterfly)|Skipper]] may be seen on the west and south sides of the Zugspitze massif, especially in July and August.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPfanzelt|Pfanzelt (1966)]], p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt;  The woods around the Zugspitze are home to [[Red Deer]], [[Red Squirrel]], [[Weasel]],  [[Capercaillie]], [[Hazel Grouse]] and [[Black Grouse]]. On the glaciers live glacier fleas (''Desoria saltans'') and [[Tardigrade|water bears]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;116ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glaciers ===
Three of the five German glaciers are found on the Zugspitze massif: the [[Höllentalferner]] the [[Schneeferner#Southern Schneeferner|Southern]] and [[Schneeferner#Northern Schneeferner|Northern Schneeferner]].

;Höllentalferner
[[File:Höllentalferner E.JPG|thumb|The Höllentalferner in 2009]]
The Höllentalferner lies northeast of the Zugspitze in a [[cirque]] below the Jubilee Ridge (''[[Jubiläumsgrat]]'') to the south and the [[Riffelwandspitzen]] peaks to the west and north. It has a northeast [[aspect (geography)|aspect]]. Its accumulation zone is formed by a [[depression (geology)|depression]], in which large quantities of [[avalanche]] snow collect. To the south the ''Jubiläumsgrat'' shields the glacier from direct sunshine. These conditions meant that the glacier only lost a relatively small area between 1981 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf.htm |titel=Höllentalferner |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times the Höllentalferner reached its greatest around 1820 with an area of 47 [[hectares]]. Thereafter its area reduced continually until the period between 1950 and 1981 when it grew again, by 3.1 hectares to 30.2 hectares. Since then the glacier has lost (as at 2006) an area of 5.5 hectares and now has an area of 24.7 hectares. In 2006 the glacier head was at 2,569 m and its lowest point at 2,203&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf/htf_topo.htm |titel=Fläche und Höhen des Höllentalferners |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Schneeferner
[[File:Nördlicher Schneeferner.JPG|thumb|The Northern Schneeferner and winter sport infrastructure in 2009]]
Southwest of the Zugspitze, between the ''Zugspitzeck'' and [[Schneefernerkopf]], is the Northern Schneeferner which has an eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 hectares (2006) it is the largest German glacier. Around 1820 the entire ''Zugspitzplatt'' was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (''Plattgletscher'') only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively constant area of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable [[terrain]] that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using piste tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend the skiing season.

At the beginning of the 1990s, ski slope operators began to cover the Northern Schneeferner in summer with artificial sheets in order to protect it from sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/nsf.htm |titel=Nördlicher Schneeferner |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2007/05/18/a0139 |titel=Pflaster für den Gletscher. |autor=Max Hägler |hrsg=taz.de |zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Schneeferner reached its last high point in 1979, when its area grew to 40.9 hectares. By 2006 it had shrunk to 30.7 hectares. The glacier head then lay at 2,789 m and the foot at 2,558&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/nsf/nsf_topo.htm |titel=Fläche und Höhen des Nördlichen Schneeferners |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern Schneeferner is surrounded by the peaks of the [[Wetterspitzen]] and the [[Wetterwandeck]]. It is also a remnant of the once great ''Platt Glacier''. Today, the Southern Schneeferner extends up as far as the [[arête]] and therefore has no protection from direct sunshine. It has also been divided into two basins by a ridge of rock that has appeared as the snow has receded. It is a matter of debate whether the Southern Schneeferner should still be classified as a glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/ssf.htm |titel=Südlicher Schneeferner |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Schneeferner also reached its last high point in 1979, when it covered an area of 31.7 hectares. This had shrunk by 2006 to just 8.4 hectares however. The highest point of the glacier lies at an elevation of 2,665 metres and the lowest at 2,520&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/ssf/ssf_topo.htm |titel=Fläche und Höhen des Südlichen Schneeferners |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caves ===
Below the ''Zugspitzplatt'' [[chemical weathering]] processes have created a large number of [[cave]]s and [[abîme]]s in the Wetterstein limestone. In the 1930s the number of caves was estimated at 300. By 1955 62 caves were known to exist and by 1960 another 47 had been discovered. The first cave explorations here took place in 1931. Other, largest exploratory expeditions took place in 1935 and 1936 as well as between 1955 and 1968. During one expedition, in 1958, the Finch Shaft (''Finkenschacht'') was discovered. It is 131&amp;nbsp;metres deep, 260&amp;nbsp;metres long and has a watercourse. There is a theory that this watercourse could be a link to the [[source (river)|source]] of the River [[Partnach]].&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;According to this theory there is a lake underneath the ''Zugspitzplatt'' that feeds the Partnach. Calculations show that the ''Platt'' produces 350 litres of water per second; the source of the Partnach however delivers at least 500 (and possibly up to several thousand litres). The difference is is put down to a cave lake that also supplies the Partnach.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;136ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lochstein.de/hoehlen/D/bayalpen/all_inn/zugspitze/zugspitze.htm |titel=Landschaft und Höhlen des Zugspitzplatts |autor= Franz Lindenmayr |hrsg= |zugriff=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
[[Image:Schema Umgebung Zugspitze.svg|right|thumb|Surrounding area]]
From the early 14th century, geographic names from the Wetterstein Mountains began to be recorded in treaties and on maps, and this trend intensified in the 15th century. In 1536 a border treaty dating to 1500 was refined in that its course was specified as running over a ''Schartten'' (&quot;wind gap&quot; or &quot;col&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauslauer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Johannes Haslauer |chapter=&quot;Nur für sehr geübte Steiger&quot;. Voralpinistische Annäherungen an das Wettersteingebirge und die Zugspitze |editor=Walter Theil |title=Alpenvereinsjahrbuch – Berg 2010 |volume=134 |publisher=Alpenvereinsverlag |location=Munich |year=2009 |page=163 |isbn=978-3-937530-50-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century the reference to this landmark in the treaty was further clarified as ''&quot;now known as the Zugspüz&quot;'' (''jetzt Zugspüz genant'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauslauer&quot;/&gt; The landmark referred to was a wind gap on the summit of the Zugspitze and is used time and again in other sources. During the [[Middle Ages]] ''Scharte'' was a common name for the Zugspitze.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauslauer&quot;/&gt;

The Zugspitze was first mentioned by name in 1590. In a description of the border between the [[County of Werdenfels]] and Austria, it states that the same border runs ''&quot;from the Zugspitz and over the Derle&quot;'' (''von dem Zugspitz und über den Derle&quot;'')&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Fritz Schmitt |year=1979 |title=Alpinmonographie: Wetterstein – Täler, Grate, Wände |publisher=Bergverlag Rother |location=Ottobrunn |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to a bridge over the River [[Loisach]]. Another border treaty in 1656 states: ''&quot;The highest Wetterstein or Zugspitz&quot;'' (''&quot;Der höchste Wetterstain oder Zugspitz&quot;'').&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt; There is also a map dating to the second half of the 18th century that shows ''&quot;the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] in the County of Werdenfels&quot;''. It covers the Reintal valley from the Reintaler Hof to the ''Zugspitzplatt'' and shows prominent points in the surrounding area, details of tracks and roads and the use pasture use. This includes a track over the then much larger Schneeferner glacier to the summit region of the  Zugspitze. However the map does not show any obvious route to the summit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kurt Brunner &amp; Thomas Horst |url=http://retro.seals.ch/openurl?rft.issn=1015-8480&amp;rft.issue=35&amp;rft.date=2007&amp;lPage=3 |title=Eine Karte des Zugspitzgebiets (18. Jh.) und die Wirrnisse um die Erstbesteigung |journal=Cartographica Helvetica |volume=Heft 35 |year=2007 |pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the Zugspitze is probably derived from its ''Zugbahnen'' or avalanche paths. In winter avalanches sweep down from the upper slopes of the massif into the valley and leave behind characteristic avalanche remnants in the shape of rocks and scree.
Near the [[Eibsee]] lake there are several [[land lot|plots of land]] with the same root: ''Zug'', ''Zuggasse'', ''Zugstick'', ''Zugmösel'' or ''Zugwankel''.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt; Until the 19th century the name ''der Zugspitz'' was commonplace. It was described as ''die Zugspitze'' for the first time on a map printed in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHiebeler|Hiebeler (1985)]], p.&amp;nbsp;252.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summit cross ==
[[File:Alpen Zugspitze Gipfelkreuz Bayern.jpg|thumb|Summit cross on the Zugspitze]]
Since 1851 there has been a [[summit cross]] on the top of Zugspitze. The driving force behind the erection of a cross on the summit was the priest, Christoph Ott. He was a keen meteorologist and whilst observing conditions from the [[Hoher Peißenberg]] mountain he saw the Zugspitze in the distance and was exercised by the fact that ''&quot;the greatest prince of the Bavarian mountains raised its head into the blue air towards heaven, bare and unadorned, waiting for the moment when patriotic fervour and courageous determination would see that his head too was crowned with dignity.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result he organised an expedition from 11 to 13 August 1851 with the goal of erecting a summit cross on the Zugspitze. Twenty eight bearers were led through the gorge of the [[Partnachklamm]] and the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley under the direction of forester, Karl Kiendl, up to the Zugspitze. The undertaking, which cost 610&amp;nbsp;[[South German gulden|Gulden]] and 37&amp;nbsp;[[Kreuzer (coin)|Kreuzer]], was a success. As a result, a 28-piece, 14&amp;nbsp;foot high, gilded iron cross now stood on the West Summit. Ott himself did not climb the Zugspitze until 1854.

After 37 years the cross had to be taken down after suffering numerous lightning strikes; its support brackets were also badly damaged. In the winter of 1881–1882 it was therefore brought down into the valley and repaired. On 25 August 1882 seven mountain guides and  15 bearers took the cross back to the top. Because an accommodation shed had been built on the West Summit, the team placed the cross on the East Summit. There it remained for about 111&amp;nbsp;years, until it was removed again on 18 August 1993. This time the damage was not only caused by the weather, but also by an ill-disciplined American soldier who had shot at the cross in 1945, at the end of the [[Second World War]]. Because the summit cross could no longer be repaired, a replica was made that was true to the original cross. After two months the rack railway carried the new cross on 12 October to the ''Zugspitzplatt'', from where it was flown to the summit by [[helicopter]]. The new cross has a height of 4.88&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;35ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It was renovated and regilded in 2009 for 15,000&amp;nbsp;euros and, since 22 April 2009, has stood once again on the East Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.br-online.de/bayern/wege-und-ziele/zugspitze-gipfelkreuz-einweihung-ID1239715496338.xml |titel=Zugspitze – Das Gipfelkreuz steht wieder |autor= |hrsg=BR-online |zugriff=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Zugspitze (Luftbild).jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of the summit]]
The first recorded ascent to the summit was accomplished by a team of land surveyors on 27 August 1820. The team was led by Lieutenant Josef Naus, who was accompanied by two men named Maier and G. Deutschl. However, local people had conquered the peak over 50 years earlier, according to a 1770 map discovered by the Alpenverein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1877123,00.html |title=Locals had climbed peak before it was 'conquered' |publisher=The Guardian |date=21 September 2006 | location=London | first=Luke | last=Harding | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 1882 the first successful winter assault on the Zugspitze was accomplished by F. Kilger, H. and J. Zametzer and H. Schwaiger.

Pilot, Frank Hailer, caused a stir on 19 March 1922, when he landed a plane with skids on the Schneeferner glacier. On 29 April 1927 [[Ernst Udet]] succeeded in taking off from the Schneeferner with a [[glider (sailplane)|glider]]; he landed at [[Lermoos]] after a 25 minute flight. The glider had been disassembled into individual parts and transported up the Zugspitze by cable car. In the winter of 1931/32, a post office was set up on the Zugspitze by the German Imperial Post Office or ''[[Reichspost]]''. It still exists today in the ''Sonnalpin'' restaurant and has the postal address: ''82475 Zugspitze''. In 1931, four years after the first glider flight, the first [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] took off from the Zugspitze

In April 1933, the mountain was occupied by of 24 [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]], who hoisted a [[swastika]] flag on top the tower on the weather station. A month later, SA and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] deployed on the Schneeferner in the shape of a swastika. On 20 April 1945 the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] dropped bombs on the Zugspitze that destroyed the valley station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway and the hotel on the ridge. After the war the Allies seized the railway and Schneefernerhaus.

Shortly after World War II the [[US military]] took over the Schneefernerhaus (as the hotel at the top was then called) for the exclusive use of US military and civilian employees. Room rates, including meals, were US $1 per day. Ski lessons were available, taught by Austrians and Germans, at a cost of US $0.25 per hour.

In 1948, the German Federal Post Office (''[[Deutsche Bundespost]]'') began operating a [[Microwave transmission|microwave radio station]] at the summit. In September of that year, three [[artiste]]s walked a steel tightrope stretched between the East and West Summits. Two members of the Traber family traversed the same route in 1953 on a tightrope on a motorcycle. Since 1953, an annual Gatterl Mass (''Gatterlmesse'') has been held on the ''Gatterl'' mountain to commemorate the four members of the [[Bavarian Border Police]] who died in an avalanche in 1952 as well as all those who have died on the Zugspitze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.zugspitzbahn.at/zugspitzbahn/de/gatterlmesse.html |titel=Gatterlmesse 2009 |autor= |hrsg=Tiroler Zugspitzbahn| sprache= |zugriff=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 a fire destroyed the ridge hotel by the mountain station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway. The [[1976 Friuli earthquake]] was also felt particularly strongly on the Zugspitze: the duty meteorologist feared that the observation tower might collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 a [[chapel]] was founded on the Zugspitze, which was consecrated by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, [[Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]], in October on the feast of [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]. On 25 March, an [[automated teller machine]] was installed at the summit station; it has since been removed. In 1995, a 450 square metre exhibition area was opened at the summit, in which artists present their work for six months, before the exhibition is changed. In 1995, the border between Germany and Austria at the summit was opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;c&quot;&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;116ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, the Zugspitze extreme mountain run has been held annually. In July 2008 there were repercussions in the [[mass media|media]] when, as the result of a sudden drop in temperature, two participants died of exhaustion and hypothermia&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/450/448184/text/ |titel=Zwei Tote bei Extrem-Berglauf – Staatsanwaltschaft untersucht Zugspitz-Drama |autor= |hrsg=sueddeutsche.de| sprache= German|zugriff=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August 2009 the Swiss, Freddy Nock, walked along a cable of the [[Zugspitze Glacier Cable Car]] from the ''Zugspitzplatt'' to the summit.

=== First ascent ===
[[File:01 Joseph Naus 1824.jpg|right|thumb|Josef Naus in 1824 by H. v. Aggenstein]]
There are several theories about the first ascent of the Zugspitze. The chronological table on an 18th century map describes the route ''&quot;along the path to the Zugspitze&quot;'' (''&quot;ybers blath uf Zugspitze&quot;'')&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives a realistic duration of 8.5&amp;nbsp;hours, so that it is reasonable to deduce that the summit had been climbed before 1820. The historian, Thomas Linder, believes that goatherds or hunters had at the very least penetrated to the area of the summit. It is also conceivable that [[smuggler]]s used routes over the Zugspitze summit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1804 cartographic surveys had taken place in the area for the County of Werdenfels. There is speculation that, in the course of this work, the royal engineer and geographer, Alois von Coulon, had reached the summit. Since Coulon worked for the Topographical Bureau, it is unlikely that his ascent would not have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded ascent of the Zugspitze was achieved on 27 August 1820 by [[Lieutenant]] [[Josef Naus]] and [[mountain guide]], Johann Georg Tauschl&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Tauschl is often called ''Deuschl''. Ritschel and Dauer have shown this to be an unexplained error. Hiebeler calls the diary entry ''Tauschl'' by Josef Naus a mistake.&lt;/ref&gt; together with Naus' survey assistant and [[batman (military)|batman (servant)]], Maier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=V1NbPeUU7dsC&amp;pg=PA124 |title=Deutschlands höchste Gipfel: 35 Touren von der Küste bis zu den Alpen |author=Herbert Farr |chapter=Die Zugspitze |pages=124–129 |isbn=978-3-8370-3316-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grant Bourne &amp; Sabine Körner-Bourne |year=2007 |title=Walking in the Bavarian Alps |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Cicerone Press]] |location=[[Milnthorpe]] |isbn=978-1-85284-497-4 |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=Oh-g8myiGMUC&amp;pg=PA137}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 21 July Naus, an officer in the [[Bavarian Army]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.de/books?id=eH4gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=josef+naus+zugspitze+bayerische&amp;dq=josef+naus+zugspitze+bayerische&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=mpygTbWTN-Lb4waI9tmeAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwADgU ''Bosls bayerische Biographie''] by Karl Bosl. Accessed on 9 Apr 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; had asked about the route through the Reintal valley to the Northern  Schneeferner. The lieutenant was taking part in a survey exercise by the Royal Bavarian Topographic Bureau (''Königlich Bairischen Topographischen Bureau'') for the Atlas of Bavaria (''Atlas von Bayern'') in the [[Werdenfelser Land]]. On 26 August, the three of them climbed in a group together with [[Captain (Army)|Captain]] Jetze and Lieutenant Antlischek up to the shepherd's hut of ''Angerhütte''.

On 27 August around 4 in the morning, Naus, Tauschl and Maier set off for the ''Zugspitzplatt'' and Zugspitze summit. From the Schneeferner glacier they attempted to reach the West Summit along the west ridge. Their first attempt failed, but a second was successful and they finally reached the West Summit around 11:45 am, where they left behind a ''[[bergstock]]'' and cloth to mark their success. A thunderstorm and snowfall forced them to climb down again quickly. On 28 August they returned to the shepherd's hut at about 3 in the morning. The mountain guide, Tauschl, was given payment of two gulden and 42 kreuzer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;9ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent ascents ===
[[File:Max Wolfinger Zug-Spitz am Eib-See 1864.jpg|thumb|The Zugspitze in 1864 (oil by Max Wolfinger)]]
In 1823, Simon Resch and the sheep ''Toni'' became the first to reach the East Summit. Simon Resch was also led the second ascent of the East Summit on 18 September 1834 with his son, Johann, and the mountain guide, Johann Barth. Because Resch's first ascent had been doubted, this time a fire was lit on the summit. On the 27th the summit was climbed for a third time by royal forester's assistants, Franz Oberst and Schwepfinger, along with Johann Barth. Oberst erected a flagpole on the summit with a Bavarian flag that was visible from the valley. The first ascent from Austria took place in August 1837. The surveyors, Joseph Feuerstein and Joseph Sonnweber, climbed to the West Summit from Ehrwald and left behind a signal pole with their initials on it. The West Summit was conquered for the third time on 10 September 1843 by the shepherd Peter Pfeifer. He was asked about the route by a group of eight climbers who later reached the summit at the behest of Bavaria's [[Marie of Prussia|Crown Princess Marie]]. She had the route checked in preparation for her own ascent of the Zugspitze. On 22 September 1853, Karoline Pitzner became the first woman on the Zugspitze.

The first crossing from the West to the East Summit was achieved in 1857 by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Härtringer from Munich and mountain guide, Joseph Ostler. The Irish brother, Trench, and Englishman, Cluster, succeeded in climbing the West Summit on 8 July 1871 through the Austrian Cirque (''Österreichische Schneekar'') under the guidance of brothers, Joseph and Joseph Sonnweber. The route through the Höllental valley to the Zugspitze was first used on 26 September 1876 by Franz Tillmetz and Franz Johannes with guides, Johann and Joseph Dengg. The first winter ascent of the West Summit took place on 7 Januar 1882; the climbers being Ferdinand Kilger, Heinrich Schwaiger, Josef and Heinrich Zametzer and Alois Zott. The Jubilee Arête (''Jubiläumsgrat'') was first crossed in its entirety on 2 September 1897 by Ferdinand Henning. The number of climbers on the Zugspitze rose sharply year on year. If the summit had been climbed 22 times in 1854, by 1899 it had received 1,600 ascents.  Before the construction of a cable car in 1926 there had already been over 10,000 ascents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;16ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normal routes ===
;Zugspitzplatt via the Reintal or Gatterl
[[File:Reintal vom Gatterl HQ.jpg|thumb|View from the ''Gatterl'' into the Reintal]]
The easiest of the normal routes runs through the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley and is that followed during the first ascent. At the same time it is also the longest climb. Its start point is the ski stadium ({{convert|730|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) at [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]. The route runs through the gorge of the [[Partnachklamm]] and along the Partnach river to the Bock Hut ({{convert|1052|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), where the Reintal begins. Above the Partnach, which has meanwhile sunk underground, the route runs up to the [[Reintalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1370|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). From there the climb is relatively gentle to start with, but then becomes steeper. From the hut the track runs through the ''Brunntal'' up to the [[Knorr Hut]] ({{convert|2057|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), which stands on the eastern rim of the ''Zugspitzplatt''. Here it meets the alternative route from Ehrwald via the Gaistal and the ''Gatterl'' at the Reintal Way. The route now runs over the ''Zugspitzplatt'' towards the Northern Schneeferner. The protected section of the climb to the Zugspitze summit begins above the ''Sonn-Alpin'' restaurant at ''Point 2815''. The route climbs through a height of 2,232&amp;nbsp; metres and the true duration is between eight and ten hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alpenvereinskarte&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;113f.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Höllental
[[File:Hoellentalangerhuette Richtung Zugspitze.jpg|thumb|View from the Höllentalanger Hut towards the Zugspitze]]
The ascent starts in [[Hammersbach (Grainau)|Hammersbach]] ({{convert|758|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) through the [[Höllental (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] along the ''Hammersbach'' stream. The path runs through the Höllental Gorge (''Höllentalklamm'') and was built from 1902 to 1905. Twelve tunnels were driven in the rock of the 1,026&amp;nbsp;metre long gorge with a total length of 288&amp;nbsp;metres. Another 569&amp;nbsp;metres of path was dynamited into the rock in the shape of a half profile, whilst 120&amp;nbsp;metres was led over [[footbridge]]s and  49&amp;nbsp;metres over scree. The construction costs came to a total of 57,000 [[gold mark]]s. Each year around 60,000 people pass through the gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Schwarz |chapter=Der Bau des Höllentalklammweges 1902 bis 1905 |editor=Walter Theil |title=Alpenvereinsjahrbuch – Berg 2009 |volume=Vol. 133 |publisher=Alpenvereinsverlag |location=Munich |year=2008 |page=252ff |isbn=978-3-937530-29-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gorge can also be circumnavigated over the ''Stangensteig'' path. After the gorge the route heads for the  [[Höllentalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1381|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), after which it crosses the ''Höllentalanger'' stream. Above that the ''Brett'' is crossed on steel pins fixed to a rock face. Crossing the ''Grünen Buckel'' the trail runs up to the Höllentalferner glacier. The glacier is mostly snow-free in summer so that crampons are required to cross it. Even more difficult is the [[randkluft]] because the ice retreats further and further from the rock as it melts. After the glacier there is a ''[[klettersteig]]'' to the summit of the Zugspitze. This route climbs through a height of {{convert|2204|m|ft|abbr=on}}, for which between seven and eight hours are needed. There is also the option of getting to the Höllental route on the ''Riffelsteig'' path from Eibsee. This path crosses the ''Riffelscharte'' wind gap and meets the route before the ''Brett''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alpenvereinskarte&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Austrian Cirque
A third ascent runs across the Austrian Cirque or ''Österreichische Schneekar''. Starting point for this are the lake of Eibsee ({{convert|950|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) or the village of Ehrwald ({{convert|1000|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The two trails merge above the cirque of ''Gamskar''. Thereafter the routhe continues to the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]] ({{convert|2209|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and through the ''Österreichische Schneekar'', at the end of which a ''klettersteig'' begins. During this section the route climbs through the ''Stopselzieher'', a natural drainage cave. The route then joins the secured sections of the Reintal route. This ascent takes at least eight hours and climbs {{convert|2012|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alpenvereinskarte&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jubilee Ridge (''Jubiläumsgrat'') ===
[[File:Jubiläumsgrat West HQ.jpg|thumb|Western section of the arête: view from the Middle Höllentalspitze to the Zugspitze]]
One of the best-known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps is the [[Jubilee Ridge]], which runs eastwards from the Zugspitze to the  [[Hochblassen]] ({{convert|2707|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and crosses the Inner ({{convert|2737|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), Middle ({{convert|2740|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and Outer [[Höllentalspitzen|Höllentalspitze]] ({{convert|2716|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) as well as the [[Vollkarspitze]] ({{convert|2630|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Along the way the route branches off towards ''Grießkarscharte'' ({{convert|2463|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and to the Alpspitze ({{convert|2628|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Between 1909 and 1915 the ridge was partially secured with wire cables by the German Alpine Club section at Munich. Originally the route was called the Jubilee Way (''Jubiläumsweg''), but after a tragic rescue attempt in 1979 the rather erroneous and misleading term, which suggested it was just a normal trail, was replaced by the name ''Jubiläumsgrat'', a ''Grat'' being a sharp ridge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;188.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the crossing, which is not a pure ''klettersteig'', several unprotected sections have to be negotiated that roughly correspond to [[climbing grade]] III. The most difficult climbing section is a smooth gully (III-). In the area of the Vollkarspitze peak is a climbing section of difficulty ([[Klettersteig|D]]). The difficulty of the roughly eight kilometre long climbing route is around  I and II as well as B. Normally it can be crossed in one day during the summer. Between the Middle and Outer Höllentalspitze is the ''Höllengrat Hut'' ({{convert|2684|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), a [[bothy]] where climbers can take refuge for the night. It is mainly used during winter crossing, when the tour is split into two stages. The approach route to the tour is also possible from the Knorr Hut via the ''Brunntalgrat'' ridge and joins the route in the area of the Inner Höllentalspitze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=1496 |titel=Tourenbuch: Jubiläumsgrat Zugspitze |autor= |hrsg=bergsteigen.at |zugriff=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accommodation ===
[[File:WienerNeustaedterHuette.JPG|thumb|The Wiener-Neustädter Hut in 2006]]
There are numerous [[mountain hut]]s in the area of the Zugspitze. One base is the [[Höllentalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1381|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the Höllental valley with 88 [[Matratzenlager|mattress spaces]]. Accommodation in the Reintal is provided by the [[Reintalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1370|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) with 90 bedspaces and on the edge of the ''Zugspitzplatt'' by the [[Knorr Hut]] ({{convert|2051|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) with 108 bedspaces. The Knorr Hut was the first hut in the entire Wetterstein Mountains when it was built in 1855. All the huts are open from May to October depending on the weather. On the top of the Zugspitze are three more huts: the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]], the [[Münchner Haus]] and the [[Schneefernerhaus]].

;Wiener-Neustädter Hut
The first hut on the Zugspitze was the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]] (''Wiener-Neustädter-Hütte'', {{convert|2209|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) built in 1884. It acts as a base for the ''klettersteig'' through the ''Österreichische Schneekar'' that was opened as far back as 1879. The hut is located on the western rim of the cirque and stand below the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car. It is operated by the [[Austrian Tourist Club]] and offers overnighting for up to 34 mountaineers in the period from July to October. The [[winter room]] is designed to take 14 people and has no cooking or heating facilities.

;Münchner Haus
{{main|Münchner Haus}}
[[File:Münchner Haus.JPG|thumb|Münchner Haus in 2005]]
There has been an accommodation hut just underneath the west summit since 1883. At that time the [[Alpine Club section]] at Munich built a wooden hut with places for twelve people. Although further development of the summit for tourism was criticised, more and more members supported the construction of a larger hut. This eventually resulted in the building of the [[Münchner Haus]] ({{convert|2959|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). First, in 1896, a 200&amp;nbsp;square metre site was dynamited out of the rock. The new mountain hut was completed on 19 September 1897 at a cost of 36,615 gold marks. It was equipped with a 21&amp;nbsp;kilometre long telephone cable and a 5.5&amp;nbsp;kilometre long [[lightning conductor]]. In the years 1911 to 1914 the hut was extended and given its present appearance. It offer 30 beds for overnight stays and is open from May to October. An average of 2,000 people stay there each year, in addition to day visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;89ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Schneefernerhaus
The [[Schneefernerhaus]] ({{convert|2656|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) was built in 1930 as the station of the [[Bavarian Zugspitze Railway]]. In June 1931 the attached [[hotel]] was opened. After the war, US Forces commandeered the house as a &quot;recreation facility&quot;. It was not released until 1952 and was then renovated, opening in December that same year. On 15 May 1965 it was hit by a serious avalanche. The avalanche had been triggered above the house and swept over the sun terrace. Ten people lost their lives and 21 were seriously injured. At the end of the 1980s the station was moved and, in January 1992 the hotel and restaurant closed. 1993 and 1997 it was extensively converted into a research station, that opened in 1996. During the building work there was a fire in 1994 that completely destroyed the fifth floor and the roof space.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;69ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourism ==
=== Winter sports ===
[[File:Zugspitze Airview 01.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial photograph]]
For those wishing to reach the summit under their own power, various hiking and ski trails can also be followed to the top. Hiking to the top from the base takes between one and two days, or a few hours for the very fit. Food and lodging is available on some trails. In winter the Zugspitze is a popular [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] destination, with several slopes on both sides. The Zugspitzplatt is Germany's highest ski resort, and thus normally has sufficient snow throughout the winter.

=== Climbing ===
At the Zugspitze's summit is the ''Münchner Haus'', a [[mountain hut]] (''Alpenhütte''), a facility built by the [[German Alpine Club]] (''Deutscher Alpenverein''). For more than a hundred years, the summit has also had a weather station, which nowadays also gathers data for the [[Global Atmosphere Watch]].

[[File:Viewfromzugspitze.jpg|left|thumb|View from the Zugspitze platform looking toward [[Austria]]]]
Climbing up the Zugspitze can involve several routes. The large difference in elevation between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the summit is {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, making the climb a challenge even for trained [[mountaineer]]s.

On the [[Germany|German]] side, from [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], climbers go either through the [[Hölle Valley (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] (&quot;Valley of Hell&quot;) or the Reintal. The way through the Reintal is the easiest, but also the longest and takes 8 to 10 hours. This path goes through the Partnachklamm, a scenic [[gorge]], then through the Reintal up to the Zugspitzplatt, a barren plateau. from there up to the summit. Climbers can stay for the night at two alpine huts, the &quot;Reintalangerhütte&quot; or the &quot;Knorrhütte&quot;.

The more popular, but harder route is through the Höllental. It starts at Hammersbach near Garmisch, goes through the Höllentalklamm, a similar gorge up to the &quot;Höllentalangerhütte&quot;, where one can take a meal or stay for the night. It then crosses the [[Höllentalferner]], the remnants of a small glacier. After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps. ''[[Klettersteig]]'' equipment is recommended for that part. Over the Irmerscharte (a gap) it reaches the summit. This path will take 7 to 8 hours.

From the Austrian village of [[Ehrwald]], there are also two variants. One goes straight through the Western Flank, which is the shortest route overall, but rather hard. It includes a ''via ferrata'', and there is a hut called &quot;Wiener Neustädter Hütte&quot; by the Austrian Alpine Club. An easier path leads via the Ehrwalder Alm, across a small pass called &quot;Gatterl&quot;, joining the Reintal path at the Knorrhütte.

'''Cologne Cathedral''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Kölner Dom}}, officially ''{{lang|de|Hohe Domkirche St. Petrus}}'', English: High Cathedral of St. [[St. Peter|Peter]]) is a [[Roman Catholic]] church in [[Cologne]], Germany. It is the seat of the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the administration of the [[Archdiocese of Cologne]]. It is a renowned monument of [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|German Catholicism]] and [[Gothic architecture]] and is a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO &gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=292 |title=UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Cologne Cathedral |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Tourism in Germany#Landmarks|Germany's most visited landmark]], attracting an average of 20,000 people a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=19247&amp;L=1 A Little Closer to Heaven], the official movie, Cologne Cathedral website. Retrieved 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of Cologne Cathedral commenced in 1248 and was halted in 1473, leaving it unfinished.  Work restarted in the 19th century and was completed, to the original plan, in 1880. It is {{convert|144.5|m|ft}} long, {{convert|86.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and its towers are approximately {{convert|157|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/interessantes.html?&amp;L=1 |title=Cologne Cathedral official website |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral is the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church in Northern Europe and has the [[List of tallest churches in the world|second-tallest]] [[spire]]s and largest facade of any church in the world. The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] has the largest height to width ratio, 3.6:1, of any [[medieval]] church.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cologne's medieval builders had planned a grand structure to house the [[reliquary]] of the [[Three Kings]] and fit its role as a place of worship for the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Despite having been left incomplete during the medieval period, Cologne Cathedral eventually became unified as &quot;a masterpiece of exceptional intrinsic value&quot; and &quot;a powerful testimony to the strength and persistence of Christian belief in medieval and modern Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cologne Cathedral Altarpiece of Magi by Stephan Lochner.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Rectangular central section of an altarpiece in the International Gothic style, showing the Three Kings adoring the Christ Child. The arrangement is formal, balanced and intricately detailed. The Virgin Mary, in a robe of brilliant blue sits enthroned with Jesus on her knee at the center of the painting. The figures have a sweet, doll-like quality. On either side kneel the two older kings clothed in robes of patterned velvet, one green and the other crimson, with gifts of a golden box and a silver chalice. The youngest king stands behind one of the kneeling figures, and presents a container of semi-precious stone.| The Altarpiece of the [[Three Kings]] by Stephan Lochner.]]

===Ancient site===
When the present Cologne Cathedral was commenced in 1248, the site had been occupied by several previous structures, the earliest of which may have been a grain store, perhaps succeeded by a [[Roman temple]] built by Mercurius Augustus. From the 4th century the site was occupied by Christian buildings, including a square edifice known as the &quot;oldest cathedral&quot; and commissioned by [[Maternus of Cologne|Maternus]], the first Christian bishop of Cologne. A free-standing [[baptistery]] from the 6th century was located at the east end of the Cathedral. The baptistery was demolished to build the old cathedral in the 9th century. Now only the ruins of the baptistery and the octagonal [[baptismal font]] remain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Koelner dom fruehchristl baptisterium.jpg|Baptismal font]] behind cathedral&lt;/ref&gt;
The second church, the so-called &quot;Old Cathedral&quot;, was completed in 818. This was destroyed by fire on 30 April 1248, during demolition in preparation for a new cathedral.

===Medieval beginning===
[[File:Rheinpanorama 1856 detail Dom.jpg|thumb|alt=Old photo of the cathedral before completion shows the east end finished and roofed, while other parts of the building are in various stages of construction.|Unfinished cathedral, 1856 with ancient crane on south tower.]]
In 1164, the Archbishop of Cologne, [[Rainald of Dassel]] acquired the relics of the [[Three Kings]] which the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] had taken from the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]], Milan, Italy. (Parts of the relics have since been returned to Milan.) The relics have great religious significance and drew pilgrims from all over [[Christendom]]. It was important to church officials that they be properly housed, and thus began a building program in the new style of [[Gothic architecture]], based in particular on the French cathedral of [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]].

The [[foundation stone]] was laid on 15 August 1248, by Archbishop [[Konrad von Hochstaden]]. The eastern arm was completed under the direction of [[Master Gerhard]], was consecrated in 1322 and sealed off by a temporary wall so it could be in use as the work proceeded. Eighty four [[misericord]]s in the choir date from this building phase.
In the mid 14th century work on the west front commenced under Master Michael. This work halted in 1473, leaving the south tower complete up to the belfry level and crowned with a huge crane that remained in place as a landmark of the Cologne skyline for 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Swaan&lt;/ref&gt;

Some work proceeded intermittently on the structure of the [[nave]] between the west front and the eastern arm, but during the 16th century this ceased.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Swaan gives the latest date as 1560, but a date of 1520 is considered more probable by other scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Hasak - Der Dom zu Köln - Bild 02 Westseite.jpg|thumb|left|The west front of the completed cathedral in 1911]]

===19th century completion===
With the 19th century [[German Romanticism|romantic enthusiasm]] for the [[Middle Ages]], and spurred on by the lucky discovery of the original plan for the facade, it was decided, with the commitment of the Protestant [[Prussia]]n Court, to complete the cathedral. It was achieved by civic effort; the ''[[Central-Dombauverein]]'', founded in 1842, raised two-thirds of the enormous costs (over US$ 1&amp;nbsp;billion in today's money), while the Prussian state supplied the remaining third.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!--The actual cost in the contemporary local currency needs to be references and there needs to be a credible source for conversion; $1,000,000,000 sounds quite implausible.--&gt; The state saw this as a way to improve its relations with the large number of Catholic subjects it had gained in 1815.

Work resumed in 1842 to the original design of the surviving medieval plans and drawings, but utilizing more modern construction techniques, including iron roof girders. The nave was completed and the towers were added. The bells were installed in the 1870s. 

The completion of Germany's largest cathedral was celebrated as a national event on 14 August 1880, 632 years after construction had begun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago1895&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Samuel Fallows|Fallows, Samuel]]|title=Progress|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NGtMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA468|accessdate=13 August 2011|year=1895|publisher=The University Association.|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration was attended by Emperor [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]].

[[File:Warning sign in cologne.jpg|thumb|US soldier and destroyed [[Panther tank]], 4 April 1945.]]

===World War II and post-war history===
The cathedral suffered seventy hits by [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|aerial bombs]] during [[World War II]]. It did not collapse, but stood tall in an otherwise flattened city. The great twin spires are said to have been used as an easily recognizable navigational landmark by Allied aircraft raiding deeper into Germany in the later years of the war, which may be a reason that the cathedral was not destroyed. It has been claimed that in June 1945 American troops used the cathedral as a rifle range.&lt;ref&gt;Monate im Dunkeln, Dr. Heinrich Schneider, 1955 (Dissertation)&lt;/ref&gt;

The repairs to the building were completed in 1956. In the northwest tower's base, an emergency repair carried out in 1944 with bad-quality brick taken from a nearby war ruin remained visible until 2005 as a reminder of the war, but then it was decided to reconstruct this section according to its original appearance. The brick-filling can be seen in the image on the right.

[[File:Richter window Cologne Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Stained glass]] window by [[Gerhard Richter]], 20 meters tall]]
Some repair and maintenance work is constantly being carried out in some section of the building, which is almost never completely free of scaffolding, since wind, rain, and pollution slowly eat away at the stones. The ''Dombauhütte'', which was established to build the cathedral and repair the cathedral, is said to employ the best stonemasons of the Rhineland. There is a common joke in Cologne that the leader of the ''Dombauhütte'', the ''Dombaumeister'' (master builder of the cathedral), has to be Catholic and free from giddiness. The current Dombaumeisterin is [[Barbara Schock-Werner]]. Half of the costs of repair and maintenance are still borne by the [[Dombauverein]].

On 25 August 2007, the cathedral received a new [[stained glass]] in the south [[transept]] window. With 113 square meters of glass, the window was created by the German artist [[Gerhard Richter]]. It is composed of 11,500 identically sized pieces of colored glass resembling [[pixel]]s, randomly arranged by computer, which create a colorful &quot;carpet&quot;. Since the loss of the original window in World War II, the space had been temporarily filled with plain glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,501994,00.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DGerhard%2BRichter%2Bdigitalisiert%2BK%25C3%25B6lner%2BDom%26hl%3Den Gerhard Richter digitizes Cologne cathedral], Google translation from German to English, [http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,501994,00.html Original German article]&lt;/ref&gt; The archbishop of the cathedral, [[Joachim Meisner|Joachim Cardinal Meisner]], who had preferred a figurative depiction of 20th-century Catholic martyrs for the window, did not attend the unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0362-4331 | last = Fortini | first = Amanda | title = Pixelated Stained Glass | work=The [[New York Times]] | accessdate =12 January 2008 | date = 9 December 2007 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/magazine/09pixelated.html?_r=1&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Heritage Site===
In 1996, the cathedral was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] of culturally important sites. In 2004 it was placed on the &quot;World Heritage in Danger&quot; list, as the only Western site in danger, due to plans to construct a high-rise building nearby, which would have visually impacted the site. The cathedral was removed from the List of In Danger Sites in 2006, following the authorities' decision to limit the heights of buildings constructed near and around the cathedral.

As a World Heritage Site, and with its convenient position on tourist routes, Cologne Cathedral is a major tourist attraction, the visitors including many who travel there as a Christian pilgrimage.

Visitors can climb 509 stone steps of the spiral staircase to a viewing platform about {{convert|98|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground. The platform gives a scenic view over the Rhine.

On 18 August 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visited the cathedral during his apostolic visit to Germany, as part of [[World Youth Day 2005]] festivities. An estimated one million pilgrims visited the cathedral during this time. Also as part of the events of World Youth Day, Cologne Cathedral hosted a televised gala performance of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]], performed by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[London Philharmonic Choir]] conducted by Sir [[Gilbert Levine]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Koelner Dom Innenraum.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[nave]] looking east]]
The design of Cologne Cathedral was based quite closely on that of [[Amiens Cathedral]] in terms of ground plan, style and the width to height proportion of the central nave. The plan is in the shape of a [[Latin Cross]], as is usual with Gothic cathedrals. It has two aisles on either side, which help to support one of the very highest Gothic vaults in the world, being nearly as tall as that of the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], much of which collapsed. Externally the outward thrust of the vault is taken up by flying buttresses in the French manner. The eastern end has a single ambulatory, the second aisle resolving into a ''[[chevet]]'' of seven radiating chapels.

Internally, the medieval choir is more varied and less mechanical in its details than the 19th century building. It presents a French style arrangement of very tall [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]], a delicate narrow [[triforium]] gallery lit by windows and with detailed tracery merging with that of the windows above. The [[clerestory]] windows are tall and retain some old figurative glass in the lower sections. The whole is united by the tall shafts that sweep unbroken from the floor to their capitals at the spring of the vault. The vault is of plain quadripartite arrangement.

The choir retains a great many of its original fittings, including the carved stalls, which is made the more surprising by the fact that French Revolutionary troops had desecrated the building. A large stone statue of [[St Christopher]] looks down towards the place where the earlier entrance to the cathedral was, before its completion in the late 19th century.

The nave has many 19th century stained glass windows. A set of five on the south side is called the ''Bayernfenster,'' and were a gift from [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], and strongly represent the painterly German style of that date.

Externally, particularly from a distance, the building is dominated by its huge spires, which are entirely Germanic in character, being openwork like those of [[Ulm Minster|Ulm]], [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|Vienna]] and [[Regensburg Cathedral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Swaan, Banister Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treasures{{anchor | Treasures of Cologne Cathedral}}==
One of the treasures of the cathedral is the High Altar, which was installed in 1322. It is constructed of black marble, with a solid slab {{convert|15|ft|m}} long forming the top. The front and sides are overlaid with white marble niches into which are set figures, with the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Holladay, ''Iconography of the High Altar in Cologne Cathedral'', (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cologne Cathedral Shrine of Magi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Shrine of the Three Kings]].]]
The most celebrated work of art in the cathedral is the ''[[Shrine of the Three Kings]]'', commissioned by Philip von Heinsberg, archbishop of Cologne from 1167 to 1191 and created by Nicholas of Verdun, began in 1190. It is traditionally believed to hold the remains of the [[Three Wise Men]], whose relics were acquired by [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the conquest of Milan in 1164.   The shrine takes the form a large [[reliquary]] in the shape of a basilican church, made of bronze and silver, gilded and ornamented with architectonic details, figurative sculpture, enamels and gemstones.  The shrine was opened in 1864 and was found to contain bones and garments.

Near the [[sacristy]] is the ''[[Gero Crucifix|Gero-Kreuz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistory.upenn.edu/smr04/101910/Slide11.18.jpg Arthistory], [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;/ref&gt; a large crucifix carved in oak and with traces of paint and gilding. Believed to have been commissioned around 960 for Archbishop Gero, it is the oldest large crucifix north of the [[Alps]] and the earliest-known large free-standing Northern sculpture of the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Hibbard&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sacrament Chapel is the ''Mailänder Madonna'' (&quot;Milan Madonna&quot;), dating from around 1290, a wooden sculpture depicting the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and the infant [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]. The altar of the patron saints of Cologne with an altar piece by the [[International Gothic]] painter, [[Stephan Lochner]] is in the ''Marienkapelle'' (&quot;St. Mary's Chapel&quot;). Other works of art are in the Cathedral Treasury.

The altar also houses the relics of [[Saint Irmgardis]].

===Jewish tablets===
Embedded in the interior wall are a pair of tablets on which are carved the provisions worked out by Archbishop Englebert II (1262–67) under which Jews were permitted to reside in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;A social and religious history of the Jews, [[Salo Wittmayer Baron]], 2nd Edition, [[Columbia University Press]], 1965, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bells===
The cathedral has eleven church bells, four of which are medieval. The first was the 3.8-ton ''Dreikönigsglocke'' (&quot;Bell of the Three Kings&quot;), cast in 1418, installed in 1437, and recast in 1880. Two of the other bells, the ''Pretiosa'' (10.5&amp;nbsp;tons; at that time the largest bell in the [[Western world]]) and the ''Speciosa'' (5.6&amp;nbsp;tons) were installed in 1448 and remain in place today.

During the 19th century, as the building neared completion, there was a desire to extend the number of bells. This was facilitated by Kaiser Wilhelm I who gave [[French Bronze|French bronze]] cannon, captured in 1870–71, for this purpose. The 22 pieces of artillery were displayed outside the Cathedral on 11 May 1872. Andreas Hamm in Frankenthal used them to cast a bell of over 27,000 kilos on 19 August 1873. The tone was not harmonious and another attempt was made on 13 November 1873. The Central Cathedral Association, which had agreed to take over the costs, did not want this bell either. Another attempt took place on 3 October 1874. The colossal bell was shipped to Cologne and on 13 May 1875, installed in the Cathedral. This ''Kaiserglocke'' was eventually dismantled in 1918 to support the German war effort.

The 24-ton ''[[St. Petersglocke]]'' (&quot;Bell of St. Peter&quot;, &quot;Dicke Pitter&quot; in the [[Kölsch dialect]]), was cast in 1922 and is the largest free-swinging bell in the world.&lt;ref&gt;The [[World Peace Bell]] in [[Newport, Kentucky]] is larger, but turns around its [[center of mass]] rather than its top.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below: '''Gallery''', Petersglocke)
[[File:CologneCathedralBell02.jpg|thumb|[[St. Petersglocke|''Petersglocke'']]; a person stands to the right of bell clapper]]

Bells of the ridge turret:
* Consecration Bell – 0.425 tons (''Wandlungsglocke'')
* Vespers Bell – 0.28 tons (''Mettglocke'')
* Angelus Bell – 0.763 tons (''Angelusglocke'')

Bells of the main bell cage in the south spire:
* Hail Bell – 0.83 tons (''Aveglocke'')
* Chapter Bell – 1.4 tons (''Kapitelsglocke'')
* St Joseph's Bell – 2.2 tons (''Josephglocke'')
* St Ursula's Bell – 2.55 tons (''Ursulaglocke'')
* Bell of the Three Kings – 3.8 tons (''Dreikönigsglocke'')
* Pretiosa – 10.5 tons
* Speciosa – 5.6 tons
* St Peter's Bell – 24 tons (''St. Petersglocke'')

==Church music==
{{Main|Organs and organists of Cologne Cathedral}}
Cologne Cathedral has two [[pipe organ]]s by [[Klais Orgelbau]], the Transept Organ built in 1948 and the Nave Organ built in 1998. Cathedral organists have included [[Josef Zimmermann]], [[Clemens Ganz]] (1985–2001) and [[Winfried Bönig]] (2001).

The '''Elbe Sandstone Mountains''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpark-saechsische-schweiz.de/index_en.html ''The Elbe Sandstone Mountains - Three major protection areas - One landscape''] at www.nationalpark-saechsische-schweiz.de. Accessed on 20 Jan 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; also called the '''Elbe sandstone highlands'''&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Robert E (1964). ''Germany: A regional and economic geography'' (2nd ed.). London: Methuen, p. 625. {{ASIN|B000IOFSEQ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Elbsandsteingebirge}}; {{lang-cs|Labské pískovce}}) is a [[mountain range]] straddling the border between the state of [[Saxony]] in southeastern [[Germany]] and the North [[Bohemia]]n region of the [[Czech Republic]], with about three-quarters of the area lying on the German side. The mountains are also referred to as [[Saxon Switzerland]] and [[Bohemian Switzerland]] in both German and Czech (''Sächsische Schweiz'' and ''Böhmische Schweiz'' in German, ''Saské Švýcarsko'' and ''České Švýcarsko'' in Czech) or simply combined as Saxon-Bohemian Switzerland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migoŕi&quot;/&gt; In both countries, the mountain range has been declared a national park. The name derives from the [[sandstone]] which was carved by erosion. The river [[Elbe]] breaks through the mountain range in a steep and narrow valley.

==Geography==

=== Extent ===
The Elbe Sandstone Mountains extend on both sides of the Elbe from the Saxon town of [[Pirna]] in the northwest toward Bohemian [[Děčín]] in the southeast. Their highest peak with {{convert|723|m|ft|abbr=on}} is the [[Děčínský Sněžník]] in Bohemian Switzerland on the left bank of the river in Bohemian Switzerland north of Děčín. The mountain range links the [[Erzgebirge|Ore Mountains]] in the west with the [[Lusatian Highlands]] range of the [[Sudetes]] in the east. Saxon Switzerland and the [[Zittau Mountains]] of the [[Lusatian Mountains]] form the [[Saxon-Bohemian Chalk Sandstone Region]].

[[File:Labe udoli.jpg|thumb|left|The Elbe valley in Bohemian Switzerland. The mountains on the horizon lie in Saxony]]

=== Terrain ===
The most striking characteristic of this deeply dissected rocky mountain range is the extraordinary variety of terrain within the smallest area. Unique amongst the Central European Uplands are the constant changes between [[plain]]s, [[ravine]]s, [[Table (landform)|table mountain]]s and rocky regions with undeveloped areas of forest. This diversity is ecologically significant. The variety of different locations, each with its own conditions in terms of [[soil]] and [[microclimate]], has produced an enormous [[species richness|richness of species]]. The numbers of [[fern]]s and [[mosses]] alone is unmatched by any other of the [[Central Uplands|German central uplands]].

The occurrence of [[Elbe sandstone]]s and hence the Elbe Sandstone Mountains themselves is related to widespread deposition by a former sea in the Upper Cretaceous epoch. On the Saxon side of the border the term &quot;Elbe Valley Cretaceous&quot; (''Elbtalkreide'') is used, referring to a region stretching from [[Meißen]]-[[Oberau (Niederau)|Oberau]] in the northwest through [[Dresden]] and [[Pirna]] into Saxon Switzerland, and which is formed by sandstones, planers and other rocks as well as basal conglomerates (''Grundschottern'' or ''Basalkonglomerate'') of older origin. Several erosion relics from [[Reinhardtsgrimma]] through [[Dippoldiswalde]] and the [[Tharandt Forest]] to [[Siebenlehn]] form isolated examples south of Dresden. They are mainly characterised by sandstones.&lt;br /&gt;
On the Bohemian side the sandstone beds continue and form part of the North Bohemian Cretaceous (''Nordböhmische Kreide''). The chalk sediments of the [[Zittau Basin]] are counted as part of the latter due to their regional-geological relationships. The sedimentary sequences of the Cretaceous sea continue across a wide area of the Czech Republic to Moravia. Together these beds form the Saxon-Bohemian Cretaceous Zone. In Czech geological circles, the Elbe Valley Cretaceous is described as the foothills of the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin&lt;ref name=&quot;Migoŕi&quot;/&gt; (''Böhmischen Kreidebecken'').

=== Geology ===
[[File:Bielatal Sachsen 2006 01 07.jpg|thumb|Hercules pillars in the [[Biela valley]]]]

The eroded [[sandstone]] landscape of this region was formed from depositions that accumulated on the bottom of the sea millions of years ago. Large rivers carried sand and other eroded debris into the [[Cretaceous]] sea. Rough quartz sand, clay and fine marl sank and became [[Diagenesis|lithified]] layer by layer. A compact sandstone sequence developed, about 20 x 30 kilometres wide and up to 600 metres thick dating to the lower [[Cenomanian]] to [[Santonian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Migoŕi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Migoŕi|first=P.|title=Geomorphological Landscapes of the World|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-TI55urJYyEC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=elbe+sandstone+mountains+geology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mPa7TfiSHIfKswbq0-D6BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 April 2011|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-3054-2|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tremendous variety of shapes in the sandstone landscape is a result of the subsequent chemical and physical [[erosion]] and biological processes acting on the rocks formed from those sands laid down during the [[Cretaceous]] Period.

The inlets of a [[Cretaceous]] sea, together with marine currents, carried away sand over a very long period of time into a shallow zone of the sea and then the [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] processes at differing [[pressure (physics)|pressure regimes]] resulted in the formation of sandstone beds. Its stratification is characterized by variations in the horizontal structure (deposits of clay minerals, grain sizes of quartz, differences in the grain-cement) as well as a typical but fairly small [[fossil|fossil presence]] and variably [[Porosity|porous]] strata. 

After the Cretaceous sea had retreated ([[marine regression]]), the surface of the land was shaped by weathering influences and watercourses, of which the Elbe made the deepest incision. Later the [[Lusatia]]n [[granodiorite]] was uplifted over the 600 metre thick sandstone slab along the [[Lusatian Fault]] and pushed it downwards until it fractured. This northern boundary of the sandstone deposit lies roughly along the line [[Pillnitz]]–[[Hohnstein (Sächsische Schweiz)|Hohnstein]]–[[Hinterhermsdorf]]–[[Krásná Lípa]] (''Schönlinde'').

[[File:SaechsischeSchweiz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Crags near [[Rathen]]]]
In the [[Tertiary]] period, the adjacent region of the [[Central Bohemian Uplands]] and the [[Lusatian Mountains]] was shaped and affected by intense [[volcanism]]; but individual [[intrusion]]s of [[magma]] also forced their way through the sandstone platform of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The most striking evidence of this phase in the earth's history are the conical basaltic hills of [[Růžovský vrch]] (''Rosenberg''), [[Cottaer Spitzberg]] and [[Raumberg (Saxon Switzerland)|Raumberg]], but also [[Großer Winterberg|Großer]] and [[Kleiner Winterberg (Saxon Switzerland)|Kleiner Winterberg]].

At its southwestern edge the sandstone plate was uplifted by over 200 metres at the [[Karsdorf Fault]], whereby the slab was tilted even more and increased the gradient of the Elbe River. The water masses cut valleys into the rock with their streambeds and contributed in places to the formation of the rock faces. Over time the gradients reduced, the streambed of the Elbe widened out and changed its course time and again, partly as a result of the climatic influences of the ice ages.

The mineral composition of the sandstone beds has a direct effect on the morphology of the terrain. The fine-grained form with clayey-silty cement between the quartz grains causes banks and slopes with terracing. The beds of sandstone with siliceous cement are typically the basis of the formation of rock faces and crags. Small variations in the cement composition of the rock can have a visible impact on the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;W. Pälchen (Hrsg.)/ H. Walter (publ.): ''Geologie von Sachsen. Geologischer Bau und Entwicklungsgeschichte''. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Stuttgart  2008, p. 340–341, ISBN 978-3-510-65239-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Quader Sandstone}}{{Anchor|Quader Sandstone Mountains}}Elbe Sandstone gets its characteristic cuboid appearance from 
its thick horizontal strata ([[massive bedding]]) and its vertical [[fissure]]s. In 1839 [[Bernhard von Cotta|Bernhard Cotta]] wrote about this in his comments on the ''[[Geological map|geognostic map]]'': &quot;Vertical fissures and cracks cut through, often virtually at right angles, the horizontal layers and, as a result, [[parallelepiped]] bodies are formed, that have given rise to the description Quader Sandstone.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Cotta: ''Erläuterungen zu Section VI der geognostischen Charte des Königreiches Sachsen und der angrenzenden Länderabtheilungen, oder: Geognostische Skizze der Gegend zwischen Neustadt, Bischoffswerda, Wittichenau, Rothenburg, Görlitz, Ostritz, Rumburg und Schluckenau''. Arnoldische Buchhandlung, Dresden und Leipzig, 1839, p. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quader'' is German for an ashlar or block of stone, hence the name &quot;Square Sandstone&quot; is also used in English.&lt;ref&gt;Leser, Hartmut, ed. (2005). ''Wörterbuch Allgemeine Geographie'', 13th ed., dtv, Munich, p. 718. ISBN 978-3-423-03422-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''quader sandstone mountains''' or '''square sandstone mountains''' (''Quadersandsteingebirge''), introduced by [[Hanns Bruno Geinitz]] in 1849, is an  historic, geological term for similar sandstone deposits, but was also used in connexion with the Elbe Sandstone Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Hanns Bruno Geinitz: ''Das Quadergebirge oder die Kreideformation in Sachsen, mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der glaukonitreichen Schichten'', Fürstlich Jablonowski'sche Gesellschaft zu Leipzig, 1850. [http://books.google.com/books?id=tnArAAAAYAAJ Digitalisat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Notiz 10 February 1850 by Bernhard Cotta. In: K. C. von Leonhard, H. G. Bronn (Hrsg.): Neues Jahrbuch für Mineralogie, Geognosie, Geologie und Petrefakten-Kunde. Stuttgart, Jg. 1850, p. 190 [http://www.archive.org/stream/neuesjahrbuchfer1850stut#page/190/mode/2up/search/Geinitz digitalised version]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wabenverwitterung.jpg|thumb|[[Honeycomb weathering]]]]

The fissures were formed as a result of long-term [[tectonic]] stresses on the entire sandstone platform of the mountain range. This network of clefts runs through the sandstone beds in a relatively regular way, but in different directions in two regions of the range.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Prescher]]: ''Geologie des Elbsandsteingebirges''. [[Verlag Theodor Steinkopff]], Dresden, Leipzig, 1959 p. 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent weathering processes of very different forms and simultaneous complex deposition (leaching, [[frost wedging|frost]] and [[salt wedging]], [[corrasion|wind]], [[solution weathering]] with sintering as well as [[biogenic]] and [[microorganism|microbial]] effects) have further changed the nature of the rock surface. For example, [[collapse cave]]s, small hole-like cavities ([[honeycomb weathering]]) with hourglass-shaped pillars (''Sanduhr''), [[Chimney (climbing)|chimneys]], crevices and mighty, rugged rock faces.

Many morphological formations in the rocky landscape of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are suspected to have been formed as a consequence of [[karstification]]. Important indicators of such processes in the polygenetic and polymorphic erosion landscape of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are the furrows with parallel ridges between them ([[Limestone pavement|grykes and clints]]) that look like cart ruts and which are particularly common, as well as extensive cave systems. They are occasionally described by the term [[pseudokarst]]. The application of the concept to several erosion formations in the sandstone of this mountain range is however contentious.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. L. Wray: [http://speleogenesis.com/pdf/SG2/SG2_artId16.pdf ''Quartzite dissolution: karst or pseudokarst?''] In: Speleogenesis Journal, Jg. 1 (2003), Edition 2 ''Speleogenesis and Evolution of Karst Aquifers''. auf www.speleogenesis.info.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.si-journal.de/index2.php?artikel=jg13/heft2/sij132-3.html Manfred Stephan: Die Landschaftsformen – unter anderen als heutigen Bedingungen entstanden.

According to them, these emerged as a result of solution processes by water in complex interactions with iron compounds from neighbouring or [[intrusion|intrusive]] magmatic-volcanic rocks. The variation in relief in these sandstone regions is explained on the basis of these processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.mnhn.lu/symposium/sandstone/ferrantia/c11_Adamovic.pdf Jiří Adamovič: ''Sandstone cementation and its geomorphic and hydraulic implications''.

Human-induced changes caused by nearly 1,000 years of continual sandstone quarrying have also contributed in parts of the  sandstone highlands to the appearance of the landscape today. The fissures (called ''Loose'' by the quarrymen) played an important role here, because they provided in effect natural divisions in the rock that were helpful when demolishing a rock face or when dressing the rough blocks of stone.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Kutschke: ''Steinbrüche und Steinbrecher in der Sächsischen Schweiz''. (Schriftenreihe des Stadtmuseums Pirna, Heft 11) Stadtmuseum Pirna, Pirna 2000. p. 4–5, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sandstone of this region is a sought-after building material used for example, for imposing city edifices such as the [[Church of Our Lady, Dresden|Church of Our Lady in Dresden]].

== Conservation ==
Large parts of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are under statutory protection. In Germany there is the national park region of Saxon Switzerland, which consists two elements: the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park]] itself, founded in 1990 and covered an area of 93&amp;nbsp;km²; and the [[protected area]] surrounding it that was founded in 1956 and covers 287&amp;nbsp;km². The German part of the range was also designated in May 2006 as one of the 77 most important national [[geotope]]s in Germany by the Academy of Geosciences in Hanover.

In the [[Bohemian Switzerland|Bohemian part of the range]] there has been a nature reserve in the northeastern region since  1972 called the Elbe Sandstone Protected Area (''Chráněná krajinná oblast Labské pískovce'') with an area of 324&amp;nbsp;km². In 2000, the Bohemian Switzerland National Park (''Národní park České Švýcarsko'') was established with an area of 79&amp;nbsp;km², bringing around 700&amp;nbsp;km² of the range under protection as a natural and cultural landscape.

== Tourism ==

The Elbe Sandstone mountains have been a popular destination for tourists for more than 200 years, and for climbers for more than 100 years. It is also a popular recreation area for the nearby Saxon capital [[Dresden]].  Places of interest include the [[Bastei]] cliffs near [[Kurort Rathen|Rathen]], the [[Königstein Fortress]], [[Pravčická brána]], the [[Schrammsteine]], [[Pfaffenstein]], and the valleys of the [[Kirnitzsch]] and [[Kamenice River (Labe tributary)|Kamenice]] rivers.
There are some 14,000 climbing routes via which mountain climbers can conquer 1100 free-standing peaks. Visitors can experience the natural scenes on the asphalt Elbe cycle path, or on board a steam [[Paddle steamer|paddleboat]] that is part of the oldest fleet of its kind in the world.

The Elbe Sandstone Mountains have numerous facilities for cure and rehabilitation. The region has a tradition of many years. The discovery of ferrous and sulphurous sources in [[Bad Schandau]] in 1730 led to its development as a [[health resort]] and the building of [[swimming baths]].

[[File:SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA PALM TREE 2010.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Downtown San Jose]] as seen with uplit palms.]]
'''Silicon Valley''' is the [[South Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|southern region]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in [[Northern California]], in the [[United States]]. The region, whose name derives from the [[Santa Clara Valley]] in which it is centered, is home to many of the world's largest technology corporations as well as thousands of small startups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silicon Valley Top 150&quot;&gt;[http://www.siliconvalley.com/sv150/ci_14902728?nclick_check=1] from SiliconValley.com&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally referred to the region's large number of [[Integrated circuit|silicon chip]] innovators and manufacturers, but eventually came to refer to all the [[high-tech]] businesses in the area; it is now generally used as a [[metonym]] for the American high-tech sector. 

Despite the development of other high-tech economic centers throughout the [[United States]] and the [[world]], Silicon Valley continues to be the leading hub for high-tech innovation and development, accounting for one-third (1/3) of all of the [[venture capital]] investment in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;PriceWaterhouseCoopers&quot;&gt;[https://www.pwcmoneytree.com/MTPublic/ns/moneytree/filesource/exhibits/Q1%202010%20MoneyTree%20Report.pdf] from PriceWaterhouseCoopers.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Geographically, Silicon Valley encompasses all of the [[Santa Clara Valley]] including the city of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (and adjacent communities), the southern [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula Valley]], and the southern [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]]. However, with the rapid growth of technology jobs in the San Francisco metropolitan area, the traditional boundaries of Silicon Valley have expanded north to include the rest of San Mateo County and the City and County of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], as well as parts of [[Marin County, California|Marin County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303807404577434281019286006.html &quot;San Francisco—Silicon Valley North] from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term ''Silicon Valley'' was coined by Ralph Vaerst, a successful Central California entrepreneur. Its first published use is credited to [[Don Hoefler]], a friend of Vaerst's, who used the phrase as the title of a series of articles in the weekly trade [[newspaper]] ''[[Electronic News]]''. The series, entitled &quot;Silicon Valley in the USA&quot;, began in the paper's issue dated January 11, 1971. The term did not become widely known and used, however, until the early 1980s, essentially synonymous with the introduction of the [[IBM PC]] and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market. ''Valley'' refers to the [[Santa Clara Valley]], located at the southern end of [[San Francisco Bay]], while ''[[Silicon]]'' refers to the high concentration of companies involved in the making of [[semiconductors]] (silicon is used to create most semiconductors commercially) and [[computer]] industries that were concentrated in the area. These firms slowly replaced the [[orchard]]s and related agriculture and food production companies which gave the area its initial nickname, the &quot;Valley of Heart's Delight.&quot;

==History==
{{quotation|&quot;Perhaps the strongest thread that runs through the Valley's past and present is the drive to &quot;play&quot; with novel technology, which, when bolstered by an advanced engineering degree and channeled by astute management, has done much to create the industrial powerhouse we see in the Valley today.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sturgeon&gt;''Timothy J. Sturgeon, Massachusetts Institute of Technology'' | Timothy J. Sturgeon, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{PDFlink|[http://ipc-lis.mit.edu/globalization/Silicon%20Valley.pdf SV Globalization]|90.0&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 92216 bytes --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[Image:AlumRockViewSiliconValley w.jpg|thumb|750px|center|Looking west over northern [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (downtown is at far left) and other parts of Silicon Valley]]
[[Stanford University]], its affiliates, and graduates have played a major role in the development of this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/travel/escapes/17Amer.html?pagewanted=1|title=Searching for Silicon Valley|last=Markoff|first=John|date=2009-04-17|work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include the work of [[Lee De Forest]] with his invention of a pioneering vacuum tube called the [[Audion]] and the oscilloscopes of [[Hewlett-Packard]].

A very powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley. From the 1890s, Stanford University's leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient indigenous local industry. Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Adams, &quot;Regionalism in Stanford's Contribution to the Rise of Silicon Valley&quot;, ''Enterprise &amp; Society'' 2003 4(3): 521-543&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s and 1950s, [[Frederick Terman]], as Stanford's dean of engineering and provost, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. He is credited with nurturing [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Varian Associates]], and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford campus. Terman is often called &quot;the father of Silicon Valley&quot;.

During 1955-85, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly Bell Telephone Laboratories, [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory|Shockley Semiconductor]], Fairchild Semiconductor, and Xerox PARC. In 1969, the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International), operated one of the four original nodes that comprised [[ARPANET]], predecessor to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Lécuyer, &quot;What Do Universities Really Owe Industry? The Case of Solid State Electronics at Stanford,&quot; ''Minerva: a Review of Science, Learning &amp; Policy'' 2005 43(1): 51-71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social roots of information technology revolution===
It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit, the [[microprocessor]], the microcomputer, among other key technologies, were developed. The region employs about a quarter of a million [[information technology]] workers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Silicon Valley was formed as a milieu of innovations by the convergence on one site of new technological knowledge; a large pool of skilled engineers and scientists from major universities in the area; generous funding from an assured market with the Defense Department; the development of an efficient network of venture capital firms; and, in the very early stage, the institutional leadership of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Information Technology Revolution by Marvel Castells (On the history of formation of Silicon Valley by Rogers and Larsen 1984 and Malone 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roots in radio and military technology===
The San Francisco Bay Area had long been a major site of [[United States Navy]] research and technology. In 1909, [[Charles Herrold]] started the first [[radio]] station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Later that year, [[Stanford University]] graduate Cyril Elwell purchased the U.S. patents for [[Arc converter|Poulsen arc]] radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. Over the next decade, the FTC created the world's first global radio communication system, and signed a contract with the Navy in 1912.&lt;ref name=Sturgeon /&gt;

In 1933, [[Moffett Federal Airfield|Air Base Sunnyvale]], California, was commissioned by the United States Government for use as a Naval Air Station (NAS) to house the airship [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|USS Macon]] in [[Hangar One (Mountain View, California)|Hangar One]]. The station was renamed NAS Moffett Field, and between 1933 and 1947, U.S. Navy blimps were based there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moffettfieldmuseum.org/history.html moffettfieldmuseum]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett Field to serve the Navy. When the Navy gave up its airship ambitions and moved most of its west coast operations to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA, forerunner of [[NASA]]) took over portions of Moffett Field for [[aeronautics]] research. Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in. The immediate area was soon filled with [[aerospace]] firms, such as [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]].

===Stanford Industrial Park===
After World War II, universities were experiencing enormous demand due to returning students. To address the financial demands of Stanford's growth requirements, and to provide local employment opportunities for graduating students, [[Frederick Terman]] proposed the leasing of Stanford's lands for use as an office park, named the [[Stanford Industrial Park]] (later [[Stanford Research Park]]). Leases were limited to high technology companies. Its first tenant was [[Varian Associates]], founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military radar components. However, Terman also found [[venture capital]] for civilian technology start-ups. One of the major success stories was [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Founded in [[Packard's garage]] by Stanford graduates [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954, Stanford created the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the University on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs. Hewlett-Packard has become the largest personal computer manufacturer in the world, and transformed the home printing market when it released the first thermal drop-on-demand [[ink jet printer]] in 1984. In addition, the tenancy of [[Eastman Kodak]] and [[General Electric]] made Stanford Industrial Park a center of technology in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1984.htm 1984 printer]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon transistor and birth of the Silicon Valley===
In 1953, [[William Shockley]] left [[Bell Labs]] in a disagreement over the handling of the invention of the [[transistor]]. After returning to [[California Institute of Technology]] for a short while, Shockley moved to [[Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California|Mountain View, California]] in 1956, and founded [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]]. Unlike many other researchers who used [[germanium]] as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that [[silicon]] was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the [[Shockley diode]]), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the &quot;simple&quot; transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley's abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]; Shockley referred to them as the &quot;[[traitorous eight]]&quot;. Two of the original employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Gordon Moore]], would go on to found [[Intel Corporation|Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/weekinreview/02goodheart.html Goodheart] July 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silicon Valley: 110 Year Renaissance, McLaughlin, Weimers, Winslow 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law firms===
The rise of Silicon Valley was also bolstered by the development of appropriate legal infrastructure to support the rapid formation, funding, and expansion of high-tech companies, as well as the development of a critical mass of litigators and judges experienced in resolving disputes between such firms.  From the early 1980s onward, many national (and later international) [[law firm]]s opened offices in San Francisco and Palo Alto in order to provide Silicon Valley startups with legal services.  Furthermore, [[California law]] has a number of quirks which help entrepreneurs establish startups at the expense of established firms, such as a nearly absolute ban on [[non-compete clause]]s in employment agreements.

===Venture capital firms===
By the early 1970s, there were many [[semiconductor]] companies in the area, [[computer]] firms using their devices, and programming and service companies serving both. Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. The growth was fueled by the emergence of the [[venture capital]] industry on [[Sand Hill Road]], beginning with [[Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers|Kleiner Perkins]] in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3 billion [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in December 1980.

===The rise of software===
Although semiconductors are still a major component of the area's economy, Silicon Valley has been most famous in recent years for innovations in software and [[Internet]] services. Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, [[software]], and user interfaces.

Using money from NASA and the [[United States Air Force]], [[Doug Engelbart]] invented the [[computer mouse|mouse]] and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s, while at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (now SRI International). When Engelbart's [[Augmentation Research Center]] declined in influence due to personal conflicts and the loss of government funding, [[Xerox]] hired some of Engelbart's best researchers. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox's [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) played a pivotal role in [[object-oriented]] programming, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs), [[Ethernet]], [[PostScript]], and [[laser printers]].

While Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to [[3Com]] and [[Adobe Systems]], and indirectly to [[Cisco]], [[Apple Computer]], and [[Microsoft]]. Apple's [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] GUI was largely a result of [[Steve Jobs]]' visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple-history.com/gui.html Graphical User Interface (GUI)] from apple-history.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Cisco's impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over Stanford's campus Ethernet.

===Internet bubble===
Silicon Valley is generally considered to have been the center of the [[dot-com bubble]] which started in the mid-1990s and collapsed after the [[NASDAQ]] [[stock market]] began to decline dramatically in April 2000. During the bubble era, real estate prices reached unprecedented levels. For a brief time, [[Sand Hill Road]] was home to the most expensive commercial real estate in the world, and the booming economy resulted in severe [[traffic congestion]].

Even after the dot-com crash, Silicon Valley continues to maintain its status as one of the top research and development centers in the world. A 2006 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' story found that 12 of the 20 most inventive towns in America were in California, and 10 of those were in Silicon Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115352188346314087.html Reed Albergotti, &quot;The Most Inventive Towns in America&quot;,] ''Wall Street Journal'', 22–23 July 2006, P1.&lt;/ref&gt; San Jose led the list with 3,867 utility patents filed in 2005, and number two was Sunnyvale, at 1,881 utility patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
According to a 2008 study by [[AeA]] in 2006, Silicon Valley was the third largest high-tech center (cybercity) in the United States, behind the [[New York metropolitan area]] and [[Washington metropolitan area]], with 225,300 high-tech jobs. The Bay Area as a whole however, of which Silicon Valley is a part, would rank first with 387,000 high-tech jobs. Silicon Valley has the highest concentration of high-tech workers of any metropolitan area, with 285.9 out of every 1,000 private-sector workers. Silicon Valley has the highest average high-tech salary at $144,800.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeanet.org/publications/idjj_cc2008_overview.asp Cybercities 2008: An Overview of the High-Technology Industry in the Nation's Top 60 Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; Largely a result of the high technology sector, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area has the most millionaires and the most billionaires in the United States per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/11/30/greediest-cities-billionaires-forbeslife-cx_ee_1203greed.html | work=Forbes | title=America's Greediest Cities | date=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The region is the biggest high-tech manufacturing center in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2321510,00.asp | work=PC Magazine | first=Chloe | last=Albanesius | title=AeA Study Reveals Where the Tech Jobs Are | date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7BDB88FD73%2D1B6F%2D4CDB%2D8CC4%2D2B311773289F%7D Silicon Valley and N.Y. still top tech rankings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The unemployment rate of the region was 9.4% in January 2009, up from 7.8% in the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_11849190 Silicon Valley unemployment rate jumps to 9.4 percent]&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon Valley received 41% of all U.S. venture investment in 2011, and 46% in 4Q11. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fenwick.com/publications/pages/venture-capital-survey-silicon-valley-fourth-quarter-2011.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Local and national media cover the Silicon Valley region and its companies. CNN, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and Bloomberg News operate Silicon Valley bureaus out of [[Palo Alto]]. Public broadcaster [[KQED (TV)]] and [[KQED-FM]], KGO-TV/ABC operates a bureau in San Jose. NBC's local Bay Area Affiliate &quot;NBC Bay Area&quot; is located in San Jose. Produced from this location is the nationally distributed TV Show &quot;Tech Now&quot; as well as the CNBC Silicon Valley bureau. San Jose-based media serving Silicon Valley include the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' daily and the ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'' weekly. Specialty media include ''[[El Observador (San José)|El Observador]]'' and the ''San Jose / Silicon Valley Business Journal''.

'''Hoover Dam''', once known as '''Boulder Dam''', is a concrete [[arch-gravity dam]] in the [[Black Canyon of the Colorado|Black Canyon]] of the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]], on the border between the US states of [[Arizona]] and [[Nevada]]. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the [[Great Depression]] and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  Its construction was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives.  The dam was controversially named after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]].

Since about 1900, the Black Canyon and nearby Boulder Canyon had been investigated for their potential to support a dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce [[hydroelectric power]].  In 1928, Congress authorized the project.  The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called [[Six Companies, Inc.]], which began construction on the dam in early 1931.  Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques were unproven.  The torrid summer weather and the lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties.  Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.

Hoover Dam impounds [[Lake Mead]], and is located near [[Boulder City, Nevada]], a municipality originally constructed for workers on the construction project, about {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].  The dam's generators provide power for public and private utilities in Nevada, Arizona, and California.  Hoover Dam is a major tourist attraction; nearly a million people tour the dam each year.  Heavily travelled [[U.S. 93]] ran along the dam's crest until October 2010, when the [[Hoover Dam Bypass]] opened.

== Background ==
=== Search for resources ===
As the United States developed the Southwest, the Colorado River was seen as a potential source of irrigation water.  An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the [[Alamo Canal]] just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the [[Imperial Valley]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=20–27}}  Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the [[Salton Sea]],{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=41–50}} the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] spent $3&amp;nbsp;million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=57–60}}

[[File:Hoover-dam-site.jpg|thumb|left|River view of the eventual site of Hoover Dam, circa 1904]]
As the technology of [[electric power transmission]] improved, the [[Lower Colorado River Valley|Lower Colorado]] was considered for its [[hydroelectric]]-power potential.  In 1902, the [[Southern California Edison|Edison Electric Company of Los Angeles]] surveyed the river in the hope of building a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} rock dam which could generate {{convert|10000|hp}}.  However, at the time, the limit of transmission of electric power was {{convert|80|mi}}, and there were few customers (mostly mines) within that limit.  Edison allowed land options it held on the river to lapse—including an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=55–56}}

In the following years, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]], known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site of a dam. Service chief Arthur Powell Davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=58–59}} {{convert|20|mi}} north of the eventual dam site, into the river.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=2}}  The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble.  In 1922, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=58–59}}

=== Planning and agreements ===
[[File:Boulder damsite sketch.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of proposed Boulder Canyon dam site and reservoir, circa 1921]]
In 1922, the Reclamation Service presented a report calling for the development of a dam on the Colorado for flood control and electric power generation.  The report was principally authored by Davis, and was called the Fall-Davis report after Interior Secretary [[Albert Fall]].  The Fall-Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern, because the river's basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=67}}  Though the Fall-Davis report called for a dam &quot;at or near Boulder Canyon&quot;, the Reclamation Service (which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year) found that canyon unsuitable.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=68}} One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a [[geologic fault]]; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=68}} or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=6}}  Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the &quot;Boulder Canyon Project&quot;.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=26–27}}

With little guidance on water allocation from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], proponents of the dam feared endless litigation.  A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) which fell within the river's basin form an [[interstate compact]], with the approval of Congress.  Such compacts were authorized by [[Article I of the United States Constitution]] but had never been concluded among more than two states.  In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-[[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=73–79}}  Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the ''[[Wyoming v. Colorado]]'' decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement.  The resulting [[Colorado River Compact]] was signed on November 24, 1922.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=81–87}}

Legislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by Representative [[Phil Swing]] (R-Calif.) and Senator [[Hiram Johnson]] (R-Calif.), but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California.  The [[1927 Mississippi flood]] made Midwestern and Southern congressmen and senators more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 13, 1928, the failure of the [[St. Francis Dam]], constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed hundreds of people.  As that dam was an arch-gravity type, as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, dam opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam's safety could not be guaranteed.  Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam.  The Colorado River Board found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the Salton Sea.  The Board cautioned: &quot;To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra-conservative lines.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|2010}}

On December 21, 1928  [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]] signed the bill authorizing the dam.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=118}}  The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $165&amp;nbsp;million for the Hoover Dam along with the downstream [[Imperial Dam]] and [[All-American Canal]], a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=27}} It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it.  This occurred on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=120}}

=== Design, preparation and contracting ===
[[File:Hoover-dam-contour-map.jpg|left|thumb|Hoover Dam architectural plans]]
Even before Congress approved the Boulder Canyon Project, the Bureau of Reclamation was considering what kind of dam should be used.  Officials eventually decided on a massive concrete [[arch-gravity dam]], the design of which was overseen by the Bureau's chief design engineer [[John L. Savage]].  The monolithic dam would be thick at the bottom and thin near the top, and would present a convex face towards the water above the dam.  The curving arch of the dam would transmit the water's force into the abutments, in this case the rock walls of the canyon.  The wedge-shaped dam would be  {{convert|660|ft|abbr=on}} thick at the bottom, narrowing to  {{convert|45|ft|abbr=on}} at the top, leaving room for a highway connecting Nevada and Arizona.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=27–28}}

On January 10, 1931, the Bureau made the bid documents available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy.  The government was to provide the materials; but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam.  The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100&amp;nbsp;pages of text and 76&amp;nbsp;drawings. A $2&amp;nbsp;million [[bid bond]] was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5&amp;nbsp;million [[performance bond]].  The contractor had seven years to build the dam, or penalties would ensue.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=34}}

The [[Wattis Brothers]], heads of the [[Utah Construction Company]], were interested in bidding on the project, but lacked the money for the performance bond.  They lacked sufficient resources even in combination with their longtime partners, [[Morrison-Knudsen]], which employed the nation's leading dam builder, [[Frank Crowe]].  They formed a joint venture to bid for the project with Pacific Bridge Company of [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Henry J. Kaiser]] &amp; W. A. [[Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel Company]] of San Francisco; MacDonald &amp; Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and the J.F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=35–42}} The joint venture was called [[Six Companies, Inc.]]—Bechtel and Kaiser were considered one company for purposes of the name.  The name was descriptive and was an inside joke among the San Franciscans in the bid—&quot;Six Companies&quot; was a [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association|Chinese benevolent association in the city]].{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=174}}  There were three valid bids, and Six Companies' bid of $48,890,955 was the lowest, within $24,000 of the confidential government estimate of what the dam would cost to build, and five million dollars less than the next lowest bid.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=45–46}}

The city of Las Vegas had lobbied hard to be the headquarters for the dam construction, closing its many [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] when the decision maker, Secretary of the Interior [[Ray Wilbur]] came to town.  Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was to be built in the desert near the dam site.  This town became known as  [[Boulder City, Nevada]].  Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=144–145}}

== Construction ==
=== Labor force ===
[[File:HooverDamJumboRig.jpg|thumb|Workers on a &quot;Jumbo Rig&quot;; used for drilling Hoover Dam's tunnels]]
Soon after the dam was authorized, increasing numbers of unemployed converged on southern Nevada.  Las Vegas, then a small city of some 5,000, saw between 10,000 and 20,000 unemployed descend on it.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=28}}  A government camp was established for surveyors and other personnel near the dam site; this soon became surrounded by a squatters' camp.  Known as McKeeversville, the camp was home to men hoping for work on the project, together with their families.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=32}}  Another camp, on the flats along the Colorado River, was officially called Williamsville, but was known to its inhabitants as Ragtown.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=53–54}}  Once construction began, Six Companies hired large numbers of workers, with more than 3,000 on the payroll by 1932{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=194}} and with employment peaking at 5,251 in July 1934.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=317}}  &quot;Mongolian&quot; (Chinese) labor was forbidden by the construction contract,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=317}} while the number of blacks employed by Six Companies never exceeded thirty, mostly lowest-pay-scale laborers in a segregated crew, who were issued separate water buckets.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=315}}

As part of the contract, Six Companies, Inc. was to build Boulder City to house the workers.  The original timetable called for Boulder City to be built before the dam project began, but President Hoover ordered work on the dam to begin in March 1931 rather than in October.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=65}}  The company built bunkhouses, attached to the canyon wall, to house 480&amp;nbsp;single men at what became known as River Camp.  Workers with families were left to provide their own accommodations until Boulder City could be completed,{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=56}} and many lived in Ragtown.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=40}}  The site of Hoover Dam endures extremely hot weather, and the summer of 1931 was especially torrid, with the daytime high averaging {{convert|119.9|°F|°C}}.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=219–220}}  Sixteen workers and other riverbank residents died of [[heat prostration]] between June 25 and July 26.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=223}}

[[File:FrankCrowe.jpg|thumb|left|General Superintendent Frank Crowe (right) with Bureau of Reclamation engineer Walker Young in 1935]]
The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW or &quot;Wobblies&quot;), though much reduced from their heyday as militant labor organizers in the early years of the century, hoped to unionize the Six Companies workers by capitalizing on their discontent. They sent eleven organizers,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=226–228}} several of whom were arrested by Las Vegas police.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=230}} On August 7, 1931, the company cut wages for all tunnel workers. Although the workers sent away the organizers, not wanting to be associated with the &quot;Wobblies&quot;, they formed a committee to represent them with the company.  The committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to Crowe the following morning.  He was noncommittal. The workers hoped that Crowe, the general superintendent of the job, would be sympathetic; instead he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper, describing the workers as &quot;malcontents&quot;.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=234–237}}

On the morning of the 9th, Crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters.  The workers were given until 5&amp;nbsp;p.m. to vacate the premises.  Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=70–73}}  Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement.  On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=73–78}}  While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages.  Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=78}}

A second labor action took place in July 1935, as construction on the dam wound down.  When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike.  Emboldened by Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1 per day raise.  The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington.  The strike ended.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=362–365}}

=== River diversion ===
[[File:Hoover-summary-map.jpg|thumb|Overview of dam mechanisms; diversion tunnels shown]]
Before the dam could be built, the [[Colorado River]] needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the [[Nevada]] side and two on the [[Arizona]] side. These tunnels were {{convert|56|ft|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;usbrfaq&quot; /&gt; Their combined length was nearly 16,000&amp;nbsp;ft or more than {{convert|3|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovtun&quot; /&gt;  The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October 1, 1933, with a $3,000 per day fine to be assessed for any delay.  To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early 1933, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=84}}

Tunneling began at the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels in May 1931. Shortly afterward, work began on two similar tunnels in the Arizona canyon wall. In March 1932, work began on lining the tunnels with concrete. First the base, or invert, was poured. [[Gantry crane]]s, running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete. The sidewalls were poured next. Movable sections of steel forms were used for the sidewalls. Finally, using pneumatic guns, the overheads were filled in. The concrete lining is {{convert|3|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} thick, reducing the finished tunnel diameter to {{convert|50|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovtun&quot; /&gt; The river was diverted into the two Arizona tunnels (the Nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water) on November 13, 1932.  This was done by exploding a temporary [[cofferdam]] protecting the Arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=305–306}}

Following the completion of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;hovtun&quot; /&gt;

=== Groundworks, rock clearance and grout curtain ===
To protect the construction site from the Colorado River and to facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were constructed.  Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river had not yet been diverted.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Cofferdams&quot; /&gt;  The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself.  The upper cofferdam was {{convert|96|ft|abbr=on}} high, and {{convert|750|ft}} thick at its base—thicker than the dam itself.  It contained {{convert|650000|cuyd}} of material.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=318–319}}

[[File:HooverDamHighScaler.jpg|left|thumb|Looking down at &quot;high scalers&quot; above the Colorado River]]

Once the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, it was necessary to remove [[Fluvial|accumulated erosion soils]] and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately {{convert|1500000|cuyd}} of material was removed.  Since the dam was an arch-gravity type, the side-walls of the canyon would bear the force of the impounded lake.  Therefore the side-walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Cofferdams&quot; /&gt;

The men who removed this rock were called &quot;high scalers&quot;.  While suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes, high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with [[jackhammers]] and [[dynamite]].  Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, High Scalers&quot; /&gt;  One high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner:  when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air.  The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers.  The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the &quot;Human Pendulum&quot; for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=308–309}}  To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden.  When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, but sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called &quot;hard boiled hats&quot; (later [[hard hat]]s) and strongly encouraged their use.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=104}}

The cleared, underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a [[grout curtain]]. Holes were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as  {{convert|150|ft}} into the rock, and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout.  This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit &quot;uplift&quot;—upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem.  A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=331–332}} After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation.  It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology.  New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=387–390}} It took nine years (1938–47) under relative secrecy, to complete the supplemental grout curtain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers 2005&quot; /&gt;

The first concrete was poured into the dam on June 6, 1933, 18&amp;nbsp;months ahead of schedule.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=323–324}}  Since concrete [[Thermal expansion|heats and contracts]] as it cures, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem.   [[Bureau of Reclamation]] engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble.  Instead, the ground where the dam was to rise was marked with rectangles, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as {{convert|50|ft}} square and {{convert|5|ft}} high.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=325–326}}  Each five-foot form contained a series of {{convert|1|in}} steel pipes through which first cool river water, then ice-cold water from a [[refrigeration]] plant was run.  Once an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout.  Grout was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase the strength of the joins.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=193–194}}

The concrete was delivered in huge steel buckets {{convert|7|ft}} high and almost {{convert|7|ft|m}} in diameter—Crowe was awarded two patents for their design.  These buckets, which weighed {{convert|20|ST|t}} when full, were filled at two massive concrete plants on the Nevada side, and were delivered to the site in special [[Railroad car|railcars]].  The buckets were then suspended from aerial [[cableway]]s, which were used to deliver the bucket to a specific column.  As the required grade of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] in the concrete differed depending on placement in the dam (from pea-sized gravel to 9&amp;nbsp;inch (230&amp;nbsp;mm) stones), it was vital that the bucket be maneuvered to the proper column.  Once the bottom of the bucket opened up, disgorging {{convert|8|cuyd}} of concrete, a team of men worked it throughout the form.  Although there are myths that men were caught in the pour and are entombed in the dam to this day, each bucket only deepened the concrete in a form by an inch, and Six Companies engineers would not have permitted a flaw caused by the presence of a human body.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=327–330}}

A total of {{convert|3250000|cuyd}} of concrete was used in the dam before concrete pouring ceased on May 29, 1935.  In addition, {{convert|1110000|cuyd}} were used in the power plant and other works.  More than  {{convert|582|mi}} of cooling pipes were placed within the concrete.  Overall, there is enough concrete in the dam to pave a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;usbrfaq&quot; /&gt;  Concrete cores were removed from the dam for testing in 1995; they showed that &quot;Hoover Dam's concrete has continued to slowly gain strength&quot; and the dam is composed of a &quot;durable concrete having a compressive strength exceeding the range typically found in normal mass concrete&quot;.{{sfn|Bartojay|Joy|2010}}  Hoover Dam concrete is not subject to [[Alkali-Silica Reaction]] (ASR) as the Hoover Dam builders happened to use nonreactive aggregate, unlike that at downstream [[Parker Dam]], where ASR has caused measurable deterioration.{{sfn|Bartojay|Joy|2010}}

=== Dedication and completion ===
[[File:Damupstream.jpg|thumb|left|The upstream face of Hoover Dam slowly disappears as Lake Mead fills, May 1935 (looking downstream from the Arizona rim)]]
With most work finished on the dam itself (the powerhouse remained uncompleted), a formal dedication ceremony was arranged for September 30, 1935, to coincide with a western tour being made by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. Pacific time to 11&amp;nbsp;a.m.; this was done because [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Harold L. Ickes]] had reserved a radio slot for the President for 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=366–369}}  Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of {{convert|102|°F|°C}}, 10,000&amp;nbsp;people were present for the President's speech in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover,{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=373}} who was not invited to the ceremony.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=304}}  To mark the occasion, a three-cent stamp was issued by the [[United States Post Office Department]]—bearing the name &quot;Boulder Dam&quot;, the official name of the dam between 1933 and 1947.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=372}}  After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=373}}

Most work had been completed by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935 and early 1936 to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the Federal Government.  The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam on behalf of the government.  Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=250–252}}

=== Construction deaths ===
[[File:HansenHooverMemorial.jpg|thumb|Oskar Hansen's memorial at the dam which reads in part &quot;They died to make the desert bloom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt;]]

There were 112&amp;nbsp;deaths associated with the construction of the dam.&lt;ref name=&quot;blf1&quot; /&gt;  Included in that total was J. G. Tierney, a surveyor who drowned on December 20, 1922, while looking for an ideal spot for the dam.  He is generally counted as the first man to die in the construction of Hoover Dam.  His son, Patrick W. Tierney, was the last man to die working on the dam's construction, 13&amp;nbsp;years to the day later.&lt;ref name=&quot;blf1&quot; /&gt; Ninety-six of the deaths occurred during construction at the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;blf1&quot; /&gt;  Of the 112&amp;nbsp;fatalities, 91 were Six Companies employees, three were BOR employees, and one was a visitor to the site, with the remainder employees of various contractors not part of Six Companies.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=320}}

Not included in the official fatalities number were deaths that were recorded as [[pneumonia]].  Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning, brought on by the use of gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels, and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=284–286}} The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached {{convert|140|F|C}}, enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases.&lt;ref name=&quot;I&amp;amp;T-2010.V25.2&quot; /&gt;  A total of 42&amp;nbsp;workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning.  No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=284–286}}

=== Architectural style ===
[[File:HansenBasReliefHooverDam.jpg|thumb|upright|Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator]]
The initial plans for the facade of the dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and ornaments clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-inspired [[baluster|balustrade]] and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect [[Gordon Kaufmann|Gordon B. Kaufmann]], then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=341}}  Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant [[Art Deco]] style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona&amp;nbsp;— the two states are in different time zones, but as Arizona does not observe [[Daylight Saving Time]], the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhinehart 2004&quot; /&gt;

At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist [[Allen Tupper True]]{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=341}} was hired to handle the design and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam.  True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Pueblo]] tribes of the region.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=342–343}}  Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=346}} With the assistance of the National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles,  baskets and ceramics.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=343}}  The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals&amp;nbsp;— lizards, serpents, birds&amp;nbsp;— and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=342–343}}  In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|p=358}}

[[File:HooverDamTrueDesign.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tile floor designed by Allen Tupper True]]
With the agreement of Kaufmann and the engineers, True also devised an innovative color-coding for the pipes and machinery, which was implemented throughout all BOR projects.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=354–356}} True's consulting artist job lasted through 1942; it was extended so he could complete design work for the [[Parker Dam|Parker]], [[Shasta Dam|Shasta]] and [[Grand Coulee Dam|Grand Coulee]] dams and power plants.  True's work on the Hoover Dam was humorously referred to in a poem published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', part of which read, &quot;lose the spark, and justify the dream; but also worthy of remark will be the color scheme&quot;.{{sfn|True|Kirby|2009|pp=361–362}}

Complementing Kaufmann and True's work, the Norwegian-born, naturalized American sculptor [[Oskar J.W. Hansen]] designed many of the sculptures on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the [[Relief|bas-reliefs]] on the elevator towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express &quot;the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, and the enormous power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment&quot;, because &quot;[t]he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt; Hansen's dedication plaza, on the Nevada abutment, contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole. 
[[File:Hoover Dam star map floor center.jpg|thumb|Hoover Dam memorial star map floor, center area]]
Surrounding the base of the monument is a [[terrazzo]] floor embedded with a &quot;star map&quot;. The map depicts the Northern Hemisphere sky at the moment of President Roosevelt's dedication of the dam. This is intended to help future astronomers, if necessary, calculate the exact date of dedication.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=379–380}} The {{convert|30|ft}} high bronze figures, dubbed &quot;Winged Figures of the Republic&quot;, were each formed in a continuous pour.  To put such large bronzes into place without marring the highly polished bronze surface, they were placed on ice and guided into position as the ice melted.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|p=43}}  Hansen's bas-relief on the Nevada elevator tower depicts the benefits of the dam: flood control, navigation, irrigation, water storage, and power. The bas-relief on the Arizona elevator depicts, in his words, &quot;the visages of those Indian tribes who have inhabited mountains and plains from ages distant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hover Artwork&quot; /&gt;

== Operation ==
=== Power plant and water demands ===&lt;!-- Section is linked --&gt;
[[File:HooverDamFrontWater.jpg|thumb|Hoover Dam releasing water from the jet-flow gates in 1998]]
Excavation for the powerhouse was carried out simultaneously with the excavation for the dam foundation and abutments. A U-shaped structure located at the downstream toe of the dam, its excavation was completed in late 1933 with the first concrete placed in November 1933. Filling of Lake Mead began February 1, 1935 even before the last of the concrete was poured that May.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Chronology&quot; /&gt;  The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500&amp;nbsp;men remained to finish it and other structures.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=248}}  To make the powerhouse roof bombproof, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about {{convert|3.5|ft}}, topped with layers of sand and tar.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|pp=280–281}}

In the latter half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three [[Francis turbine]]-[[electric generator|generators]], all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating and the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1345 megawatts at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Chronology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A2Z Las Vegas, Hoover&quot; /&gt;  Original plans called for 16&amp;nbsp;large generators, eight on each side of the river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller municipalities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt;  The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hoover Dam and Powerplant&quot; /&gt;

Before water from Lake Mead reaches the turbines, it enters the intake towers and enters four gradually narrowing [[penstock]]s which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The intakes provide a maximum [[hydraulic head]] (water pressure) of {{convert|590|ft|m|abbr=on}} as the water reaches a speed of about {{convert|85|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}. The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and [[outlet works]] (jet-flow gates) are rarely used.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt;  The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures {{convert|180|ft}} above the river and at river level, may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|p=40}}  Following an [[Grid energy storage#Hydroelectric dam uprating|uprating]] project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] [[Pelton turbine]]-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt;  The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 [[terawatt-hour|TWh]] in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt; The average has been about 4.2 TWh/year.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt;

Control of water was the primary concern in the building of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self-sustaining: proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50-year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the multi-million dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands. Lake Mead and downstream releases from the dam provide water for both [[Water supply|municipal]] and [[irrigation]] uses. Water released from the Hoover Dam eventually reaches the [[All-American Canal]] for the irrigation of over {{convert|1000000|acre}} of land. Water from the lake serves 8 million people in Arizona, Nevada and California.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hoover Dam and Powerplant&quot; /&gt;

==== Power distribution ====
Electricity from the dam's powerhouse was originally sold pursuant to a fifty-year contract, authorized by Congress in 1934, which ran from 1937 to 1987.  In 1984, Congress passed a new statute which set power allocations from the dam from 1987 to 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lien-Mager 2011&quot; /&gt;  The powerhouse was run under the original authorization by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison; in 1987, the Bureau of Reclamation assumed control.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|pp=50–52}}  On December 20, 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] signed legislation extending the current contracts until 2067, after setting aside 5% of Hoover Dam's power for sale to Native American tribes, electric cooperatives, and other entities.  The new arrangement will begin in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lien-Mager 2011&quot; /&gt;  The [[Bureau of Reclamation]] reports that the energy generated is presently allocated as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;powerfaq&quot; /&gt;

=== Spillways ===
[[File:Hoover Dam and Arizona Spillway, 1983.jpg|thumb|Water enters the Arizona spillway (left) during the 1983 floods]]
The dam is protected against over-topping by two [[spillways]]. The spillway entrances are located behind each dam [[Abutment#Miscellanea|abutment]], running roughly parallel to the canyon walls. The spillway entrance arrangement forms a classic side-flow [[weir]] with each spillway containing four {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} long and {{convert|16|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} high steel drum gates. Each gate weighs {{convert|5000000|lb}} and can be operated manually or automatically. Gates are raised and lowered depending upon water levels in the reservoir and flood conditions. The gates cannot completely stop water from entering the spillways but can help maintain an extra {{convert|16|ft|abbr=on}} of lake level.&lt;ref name=&quot;recspi&quot; /&gt;
Water flowing over the spillways drops sharply into {{convert|600|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|50|ft|abbr=on}} wide spillway tunnels before connecting to the outer diversion tunnels, and reentering the main river channel below the dam.  This complex spillway entrance arrangement combined with the approximate {{convert|700|ft|abbr=on}} elevation drop from the top of the reservoir to the river below was a difficult engineering problem and posed several design challenges. Each spillway's capacity of {{convert|200000|ft3/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} was empirically verified in post construction tests in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;recspi&quot; /&gt;

The large spillway tunnels have only been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983.  Both times, in inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock.{{sfn|Fiedler|2010}}  The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused [[cavitation]], a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force.  In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete  and the surface of the concrete was polished mirror-smooth.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=391–392}}  The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage.  The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways.{{sfn|Fiedler|2010}} Tests at [[Grand Coulee Dam]] showed that the technique worked, in principle.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|pp=391–392}}

=== Roadway and tourism ===
[[File:MikeO'Callaghan–PatTillmanMemorialBridge.jpg|thumb|The bypass as seen from the dam]]
There are two lanes for automobile traffic across the top of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for [[U.S. Route 93]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoover Dam Bypass, porpoise ;) overview&quot; /&gt;  In the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], authorities expressed security concerns and the [[Hoover Dam Bypass]] project was expedited. Pending the completion of the bypass, restricted traffic was permitted over Hoover Dam. Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while [[semi-trailer truck]]s, [[bus]]es carrying luggage, and enclosed-[[box truck]]s over {{convert|40|ft|m}} long were not allowed on the dam at all, and were diverted to [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] or Nevada State Routes [[Nevada State Route 163|163]]/[[Nevada State Route 68|68]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Crossing Hoover&quot; /&gt;  The four-lane Hoover Dam Bypass opened on October 19, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen 2010-10-20&quot; /&gt;  It includes a  composite steel and concrete [[arch bridge]], the [[Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge]], {{convert|1500|ft|abbr=on}} downstream  from the dam.
With the opening of the bypass, through traffic is no longer allowed across Hoover Dam, though dam visitors are allowed to use the existing roadway to approach from the Nevada side and cross to parking lots and other facilities on the Arizona side.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdbfaq&quot; /&gt;

Hoover Dam opened for tours in 1937, after its completion, but on December 7, 1941, was closed to the public for the duration of World War II, during which only authorized traffic, in convoys, was permitted.  It reopened September 2, 1945, and by 1953, annual attendance had risen to 448,081.  The dam closed on November 25, 1963 and March 31, 1969, days of mourning in remembrance of Presidents [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].  In 1995, a new visitors' center was built, and the following year, visits exceeded one million for the first time.  The dam closed again to the public on September 11, 2001; modified tours were resumed in December and a new &quot;Discovery Tour&quot; was added the following year.{{sfn|Bureau of Reclamation|2006|pp=50–52}} Today, nearly a million people per year take the tours of the dam offered by the Bureau of Reclamation.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Hoover Tour&quot; /&gt;  Increased security concerns by the government have led to most of the interior structure being inaccessible to tourists.  As a result, few of True's decorations can be seen any longer by visitors.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=379}}

== Environmental impact ==
[[File:LakeMeadJuly2009.jpg|thumb|left|A view upstream from Hoover Dam in July 2009 shows that the water level has decreased drastically.]]
The changes in water flow and use caused by Hoover Dam's construction and operation have had a large impact on the [[Colorado River Delta]].{{sfn|Glenn Lee et al.|1996}}  The construction of the dam has been credited as causing the decline of this [[estuarine]] [[ecosystem]].{{sfn|Glenn Lee et al.|1996}}  For six years after the construction of the dam, while Lake Mead filled, virtually no water reached the mouth of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burns 2001&quot; /&gt;  The delta's estuary, which once had a freshwater-saltwater mixing zone stretching {{convert|40|mi}} south of the river's mouth, was turned into an inverse estuary where the level of [[salinity]] was higher close to the river's mouth.{{sfn|Rodriguez Flessa et al.|2001}}

The Colorado River had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the Hoover Dam.  The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which imperiled many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals.{{sfn|Schmidt Webb et al.|1998}} The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam.{{sfn|Cohn|2001}} Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the [[Bonytail chub]], [[Colorado pikeminnow]], [[Humpback chub]], and [[Razorback sucker]], are currently listed as [[endangered species|endangered]].{{sfn|Minckley Marsh et al.|2003}}&lt;ref name=&quot;FWS, Colorado River Recovery&quot; /&gt;

== Naming controversy ==
During the years of lobbying leading up to the passage of legislation authorizing the dam in 1928, the dam was generally referred to by the press as &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; or &quot;Boulder Canyon Dam&quot;, notwithstanding the fact that the proposed site had been shifted to Black Canyon.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|pp=26–27}}  The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 (BCPA) never mentions a proposed name or title for the dam. The BCPA merely allows the government to &quot;construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;USBR, Boulder Canyon Project Act&quot; /&gt;

When Secretary [[Ray Wilbur|Wilbur]] spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam &quot;Hoover Dam&quot;, citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office.  Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was &quot;the great engineer whose vision and persistence&amp;nbsp;... has done so much to make &lt;nowiki&gt;[the dam]&lt;/nowiki&gt; possible&quot;.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=305}}  One writer complained in response that &quot;the Great Engineer had quickly drained, ditched, and dammed the country&quot;.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=305}}

After Hoover's election defeat and the accession of the Roosevelt administration, Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13, 1933 that the dam be referred to as &quot;Boulder Dam&quot;. Ickes stated that Wilbur had been imprudent in naming the structure after a sitting president, that Congress had never ratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam.{{sfn|Dunar|McBride|2001|p=305}}  When Ickes spoke at the dedication ceremony on September 30, 1935, he was determined, as he recorded in his diary, &quot;to try to nail down for good and all the name Boulder Dam&quot;.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=372}}  At one point in the speech, he spoke the words &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; five times within thirty seconds.{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=246}} Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator [[Hiram Johnson]], a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=372}} Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam,{{sfn|Stevens|1988|p=248}} and the Republican-leaning ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', which at the time of Ickes' name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively chipping away at an enormous sign &quot;HOOVER DAM&quot;, reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success.{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=374}}

In the following years, the name &quot;Boulder Dam&quot; failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using the two names interchangeably and mapmakers divided as to what name should be printed.  Memories of the [[Great Depression]] faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II.  In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name to &quot;Hoover Dam&quot;.  Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, &quot;I didn't know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with.&quot;{{sfn|Hiltzik|2010|p=381}}

'''Neuschwanstein Castle'''  ({{lang-de|'''Schloss Neuschwanstein'''}}, {{IPA-de|nɔʏˈʃvaːnʃtaɪn|pron}}) is a 19th-century [[Romanesque Revival]] [[palace]] on a rugged hill above the village of [[Hohenschwangau]] near [[Füssen]] in southwest [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The palace was commissioned by [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] as a retreat and as an homage to [[Richard Wagner]]. Ludwig paid for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, not with Bavarian public funds (see [[#Funding|below]]).
&lt;!--Although public photography of the interior is not permitted,&lt;ref name=&quot;tour&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Neuschwanstein Castle: Tourist info|url=http://www.neuschwanstein.de/englisch/tourist/index.htm|accessdate = 2010-03-11|publisher=[[Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes|Bavarian Palace Department]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the most photographed building in Germany{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and one of the country's most popular [[Tourism in Germany|tourist destinations]].--&gt;

The palace was intended as a personal refuge for the reclusive king, but it was opened to the paying public immediately after his death in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;50million&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bayerisches Staatsministerium der Finanzen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then over 60 million people have visited Neuschwanstein Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;premiummarke&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bayerisches Staatsministerium der Finanzen|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with up to 6,000 per day in the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bayerisches Staatsministerium der Finanzen|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palace has appeared prominently in several movies and was the inspiration for [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]'s [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=79,83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, similar structures.

==Location==
[[File:Forggensee HQ.jpg|thumb|left|Northward view from Mount [[Säuling]] ({{convert|2047|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) on the border between Bavaria and [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]: [[Schwangau]] between large [[Forggensee]] reservoir (1952) and Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein palaces]]
The municipality of [[Schwangau]] lies at an elevation of {{convert|800|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} at the south west border of the German state of [[Bavaria]]. Its surroundings are characterized by the transition between the [[Swabian-Bavarian Alpine Foothills|Alpine foothills]] in the south (towards the nearby Austrian border) and a hilly landscape in the north that appears flat by comparison.

In the [[Middle Ages]], three castles overlooked the villages. One was called ''Schwanstein Castle''.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;{{lang-de|Burg Schwanstein}} literally translates as ''Swanstone Castle''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Ludwig's father [[Maximilian II of Bavaria|King Maximilian II of Bavaria]] bought its ruins to replace them with the comfortable neo-Gothic palace known as [[Hohenschwangau Castle]]. Finished in 1837, the palace became his family's summer residence, and his elder son Ludwig (born 1845) spent a large part of his childhood here.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

''Vorderhohenschwangau Castle'' and ''Hinterhohenschwangau Castle''&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vorderhohenschwangau Castle ({{lang-de|Burg Vorderhohenschwangau}}) and Hinterhohenschwangau Castle ({{lang-de|Burg Hinterhohenschwangau}}) were collectively referred to as ''Hohenschwangau Castle'' ({{lang-de|Burg Hohenschwangau}}).  Confusingly, the neo-Gothic palace built by Ludwig's father is known in English under the same name; in German it is called ''Hohenschwangau Palace'' ({{lang-de|Schloss Hohenschwangau}}). An approximate literal translation of ''Hohenschwangau'' is ''High Swan District'', but ''Gau'' refers to a large unforested area. The prefixes ''Vorder-'' and ''Hinter-'' identify &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; of the ensemble.&lt;/ref&gt; sat on a rugged hill overlooking Schwanstein Castle, two nearby lakes ([[Alpsee]] and [[Schwansee]]), and the village. Separated only by a [[moat]], they jointly consisted of a hall, a [[keep]], and a fortified [[tower house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchali|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century only ruins remained of the medieval twin castles, but those of Hinterhohenschwangau served as a lookout place known as ''Sylphenturm''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins above the family palace were known to the crown prince from his excursions. He first sketched one of them in his diary in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rauch|1991|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the young king came to power in 1864, the construction of a new palace in place of the two ruined castles became the first in his series of palace building projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN110&quot; /&gt;  Ludwig called the new palace ''New Hohenschwangau Castle''; only after his death was it renamed ''Neuschwanstein''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confusing result is that Hohenschwangau and Schwanstein have effectively swapped names: Hohenschwangau Castle replaced the ruins of Schwanstein Castle, and Neuschwanstein Castle replaced the ruins of the two Hohenschwangau Castles.

Neuschwanstein embodies both the contemporaneous architectural fashion known as ''castle romanticism'' ({{lang-de|Burgenromantik}}), and Ludwig II's immoderate enthusiasm for the operas of [[Richard Wagner]].

In the 19th century, many castles were constructed or reconstructed; often with significant changes to make them more picturesque.  Palace-building projects similar to Neuschwanstein had been undertaken earlier in several of the German states and included Hohenschwangau Castle, [[Lichtenstein Castle]], [[Hohenzollern Castle]] and numerous buildings on the [[Rhine|River Rhine]] such as [[Stolzenfels Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pevsner|Honour|Fleming|1992|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inspiration for the construction of Neuschwanstein came from two journeys in 1867&amp;nbsp;— one in May to the reconstructed [[Wartburg]] near [[Eisenach]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; another in July to the [[Château de Pierrefonds]], which [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] was transforming from a ruined castle into a [[Historism|historistic]] palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB51&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The journeys fell into the period of the homosexual king's engagement with his cousin [[Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria|Sophie in Bavaria]], which was announced in January and dissolved by Ludwig in October.&lt;/ref&gt;

The king saw both buildings as representatives of a romantic interpretation of the Middle Ages as well as the musical mythology of his friend [[Richard Wagner]].  Wagner's operas [[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]] and [[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]] had made a lasting impression on him.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN197&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blunt|1970|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1868, Ludwig's grandfather [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig I]] died, freeing the considerable sums that were previously spent on the abdicated king's [[appanage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN110&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]] and after a scandalous affair with [[Lola Montez]], King Ludwig I of Bavaria had to abdicate in favour of his son Maximilian.&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed Ludwig II to start the architectural project of building a private refuge in the familiar landscape far from the capital [[Munich]], so that he could live out his idea of the Middle Ages.

{{quotation|It is my intention to rebuild the old castle ruin of Hohenschwangau near the Pöllat Gorge in the authentic style of the old German knights' castles, and I must confess to you that I am looking forward very much to living there one day [...]; you know the revered guest I would like to accommodate there; the location is one of the most beautiful to be found, holy and unapproachable, a worthy temple for the divine friend who has brought salvation and true blessing to the world. It will also remind you of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (Singers' Hall with a view of the castle in the background), &quot;Lohengrin'&quot; (castle courtyard, open corridor, path to the chapel) [...].|Ludwig II|Letter to Richard Wagner|May 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Neuschwanstein Castle: Idea and History|url=http://www.neuschwanstein.de/englisch/idea/index.htm|accessdate = 2010-03-11|publisher=[[Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes|Bavarian Palace Department]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The building design was drafted by the [[scenic design|stage designer]] [[Christian Jank]] and realized by the architect [[Eduard Riedel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For technical reasons the ruined castles could not be integrated into the plan.  Initial ideas for the palace drew stylistically on [[Nuremberg Castle]] and envisaged a simple building in place of the old Vorderhohenschwangau Castle, but they were rejected and replaced by increasingly extensive drafts, culminating in a bigger palace modelled on the Wartburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN10&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The king insisted on a detailed plan and on personal approval of each and every draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ludwig's control went so far that the palace has been regarded as his own creation, rather than that of the architects involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rauch|1991|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Il Castello di Neuschwanstein.jpg|thumg|left|Kitsch]]--&gt;
Whereas contemporary architecture critics derided Neuschwanstein, one of the last big palace building projects of the 19th century, as [[kitsch]], Neuschwanstein and Ludwig II's other buildings are now counted among the major works of European [[historicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For financial reasons a project similar to Neuschwanstein&amp;nbsp;– [[Falkenstein Castle (Pfronten)|Falkenstein Castle]]&amp;nbsp;– never left the planning stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB82&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace can be regarded as typical for 19th century architecture. The shapes of Romanesque (simple geometric figures such as cuboids and semicircular arches), Gothic (upward-pointing lines, slim towers, delicate embellishments) and Byzantine architecture and art (the Throne Hall décor) were mingled in an eclectic fashion and supplemented with 19th-century technical achievements.  The [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Patrona Bavariae]] and [[Saint George]] on the court face of the {{not a typo|Palas}} (main building) are depicted in the local ''[[Lüftlmalerei]]'' style, a [[fresco]] technique typical for [[Allgäu]] farmers' houses, while the unimplemented drafts for the Knights' House gallery foreshadow elements of [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN212&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blunt|1970|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Characteristic of Neuschwanstein's design are theatre themes: Christian Jank drew on coulisse drafts from his time as a scenic painter.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN9&quot; /&gt;

The basic style was originally planned to be neo-Gothic but the palace was primarily built in Romanesque style in the end. The operatic themes moved gradually from Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to [[Parsifal]].&lt;ref name=Ammon107 /&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Johannes Bernhard Neuschwanstein Baustelle 1882-85 (01).jpg|thumb|Neuschwanstein under construction: Bower still missing, Rectangular Tower under construction (photograph c. 1882–85)]]
[[File:Neuschwanstein - Blick in den oberen Schlosshof.jpg|thumb|Neuschwanstein under construction: upper courtyard (photograph c. 1886)]]
In 1868, the ruins of the medieval twin castles were completely demolished; the remains of the old keep were blown up.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN114&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blunt|1970|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation stone for the palace was laid on September 5, 1869; in 1872 its cellar was completed and in 1876, everything up to the first floor, the gatehouse bring finished first. At the end of 1882 it was completed and fully furnished, allowing Ludwig to take provisional lodgings there and observe the ongoing construction work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ammon107&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ammon|2007|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1874, management of the civil works passed from Eduard Riedel to [[Georg von Dollmann]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN11&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[topping out]] ceremony for the {{not a typo|Palas}} was in 1880, and in 1884, the king was able to move into the new building. In the same year the direction of the project passed to [[Julius Hofmann]], after Dollmann had fallen from the King's favor.

The palace was erected as a conventional brick construction and later encased in various types of rock. The white limestone used for the fronts came from a nearby quarry.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sandstone bricks for the [[portal (architecture)|portals]] and [[bay window]]s came from [[Schlaitdorf]] in [[Württemberg]].  [[Marble]] from [[Untersberg]] near [[Salzburg]] was used for the windows, the arch ribs, the [[column]]s and the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]].  The Throne Hall was a later addition to the plans and required a steel framework.

The transport of building materials was facilitated by scaffolding and a steam crane that lifted the material to the construction site.  Another crane was used at the construction site.  The recently founded [[Technischer Überwachungsverein|Dampfkessel-Revisionsverein]] (Steam Boiler Inspection Association) regularly inspected both boilers.

[[File:LudwigII-JAlbert.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Ludwig II (1886)]]
For about two decades the construction site was the principal employer in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB64&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1880, about 200&amp;nbsp;craftsmen were occupied at the site,&lt;ref name=&quot;AR14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rauch|1991|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; not counting suppliers and other persons indirectly involved in the construction.  At times when the king insisted on particularly close deadlines and urgent changes, reportedly up to 300&amp;nbsp;workers per day were active, sometimes working at night by the light of oil lamps.  Statistics from the years 1879/1880 support an immense amount of building materials: {{convert|465|t|ST|lk=on}} of Salzburg marble, {{convert|1550|t|ST|abbr=on}} of sandstone, 400,000 bricks and {{convert|2050|m3|cuyd}} of wood for the scaffolding.

In 1870, a society was founded for insuring the workers, for a low monthly fee, augmented by the king. The heirs of construction casualties (30 cases are mentioned in the statistics) received a small pension.

In 1884, the king was able to move into the (still unfinished) {{not a typo|Palas}},&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1885, he invited his mother [[Marie of Prussia|Marie]] to Neuschwanstein on the occasion of her 60th birthday.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The former queen resided in Hohenschwangau Castle. The two had a strained relationship, at least in part because Marie disapproved of Wagner.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1886, the external structure of the ''{{not a typo|Palas}}'' (hall) was mostly finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN19&quot; /&gt;  In the same year, Ludwig had the first, wooden ''Marienbrücke'' over the Pöllat Gorge replaced by a steel construction.

Despite its size, Neuschwanstein did not have space for the [[court (royal)|royal court]], but contained only the king's private lodging and servants' rooms.  The court buildings served decorative, rather than residential purposes:&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The palace was intended to serve Ludwig II as a kind of inhabitable theatrical setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN19&quot; /&gt; As a ''temple of friendship'' it was also dedicated to the life and work of Richard Wagner, who died in 1883 before he had set foot in the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB67&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, Ludwig II only lived in the palace for a total of 172&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merkle68&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Merkle|2001|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The effect of the Neuschwanstein ensemble is highly theatrical, both externally and internally. The king's influence is apparent throughout, and he took a keen personal interest in the design and decoration. An example can be seen in his comments, or commands, regarding a mural depicting Lohengrin in the {{not a typo|Palas}}; &quot;His Majesty wishes that ... the ship be placed further from the shore, that Lohengrin's neck be less tilted, that the chain from the ship to the swan be of gold and not of roses, and finally that the style of the castle shall be kept medieval.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The suite of rooms within the {{not a typo|Palas}} contains the Throne Room, Ludwig's suite, the Singers' Hall, and the Grotto. Throughout, the design pays homage to the German legends of Lohengrin, the Swan Knight. Hohenschwangau, where Ludwig spent much of his youth, had decorations of these sagas. These themes were taken up in the operas of [[Richard Wagner]]. Many rooms bear a border depicting the various operas written by Wagner, including a theater permanently featuring the set of one such play.  Many of the interior rooms remain undecorated, with only 14 rooms finished before Ludwig's death.&lt;ref name=historical&gt;{{harvnb|Desing|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the palace under construction at the king's death, one of the major features of the palace remained unbuilt. A massive [[keep]] was planned for the middle of the upper courtyard but was never built, at the decision of the King's family. The foundation for the keep is visible in the upper courtyard.

[[File:Neuschwanstein castle.jpg|thumb|View from south-east, {{not a typo|Palas}} on the left]]
Neuschwanstein Castle consists of several individual structures which were erected over a length of 150&amp;nbsp;metres on the top of a cliff ridge. The elongate building is furnished with numerous towers, ornamental turrets, gables, balconies, pinnacles and sculptures. Following Romanesque style, most window openings are fashioned as bi- and [[triforium|triforia]]. Before the backdrop of the [[Tegelberg]] and the Pöllat Gorge in the south and the [[Swabian-Bavarian Alpine Foothills|Alpine foothills]] with their lakes in the north, the ensemble of individual buildings provides varying picturesque views of the palace from all directions. It was designed as the romantic ideal of a knight's castle. Unlike &quot;real&quot; castles, whose building stock is in most cases the result of centuries of building activity, Neuschwanstein was planned from the inception as an intentionally asymmetric building, and erected in consecutive stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR13&quot; /&gt;  Typical attributes of a castle were included, but real fortifications&amp;nbsp;– the most important feature of a medieval aristocratic estate&amp;nbsp;– were dispensed with.

===Exterior===
[[File:Neuschwanstein detail.jpg|thumb|upright|left|{{not a typo|Palas}} roof]]
[[File:NeuSchwanstein 3 Ausschnitt.JPG|thumb|Overview of palace complex; position of the planned chapel marked in yellow]]
[[File:Hohenschwangau - Schloss Neuschwanstein5.jpg|thumb|View from location of unrealized chapel along upper courtyard level: Bower (left), {{not a typo|Palas}}front, and Knights' House (right)]]
The palace complex is entered through the symmetrical Gatehouse flanked by two stair towers.  The eastward-pointing gate building is the only structure of the palace whose wall area is fashioned in high-contrast colours; the exterior walls are cased with red bricks, the court fronts with yellow [[limestone]].  The roof [[cornice]] is surrounded by pinnacles.  The upper floor of the Gatehouse is surmounted by a [[crow-stepped gable]] and held Ludwig II's first lodging at Neuschwanstein, from which he occasionally observed the building work before the hall was completed.  The ground floors of the Gatehouse were intended to accommodate the stables.

The passage through the Gatehouse, crowned with the [[Coat of arms of Bavaria|royal Bavarian coat of arms]], leads directly into the courtyard. The courtyard has two levels, the lower one being defined to the east by the Gatehouse and to the north by the foundations of the so-called Rectangular Tower and by the gallery building. The southern end of the courtyard is open, imparting a view of the surrounding mountain scenery.  At its western end, the courtyard is delimited by a bricked embankment, whose polygonally protracting bulge marks the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] of the originally projected chapel; this three-nave church, never built, was intended to form the base of a 90-metre (295-ft) [[keep]], the planned centrepiece of the architectural ensemble. A flight of steps at the side gives access to the upper level.

[[File:Schloss Neuschwanstein IMG 6891.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Saint George]]
[[File:Schloss Neuschwanstein 6862.jpg|thumb|Gatehouse]]
Today, the foundation plan of the chapel-keep is marked out in the upper-courtyard pavement.  The most striking structure of the upper court level is the so-called Rectangular Tower (45&amp;nbsp;metres or 148 feet).  Like most of the court buildings, it mostly serves a decorative purpose as part of the ensemble. Its viewing platform provides a vast view over the Alpine foothills to the north.  The northern end of the upper courtyard is defined by the so-called Knights' House. The three-storey building is connected to the Rectangular Tower and the Gatehouse by means of a continuous gallery fashioned with a [[blind arcade]].  From the point of view of castle romanticism the Knights' House was the abode of a stronghold's menfolk; at Neuschwanstein, estate and service rooms were envisioned here.  The Bower, which complements the Knights' House as the &quot;ladies' house&quot; but was never used as such, defines the south side of the courtyard. Both structures together form the motif of the ''Antwerp Castle'' featuring in the first act of ''Lohengrin''.  Embedded in the pavement is the floor plan of the planned palace chapel.

The western end of the courtyard is delimited by the ''{{not a typo|Palas}}'' (hall). It constitutes the real main and residential building of the castle and contains the king's stateroom and the servants' rooms. The {{not a typo|Palas}} is a colossal five-story structure in the shape of two huge cuboids that are connected in a flat angle and covered by two adjacent high gable roofs. The building's shape follows the course of the ridge.  In its angles there are two stair towers, the northern one surmounting the palace roof by several storeys with its height of 65&amp;nbsp;metres (213&amp;nbsp;ft).  With their polymorphic roofs, both towers are reminiscent of the [[Château de Pierrefonds]].  The western {{not a typo|Palas}} front supports a two-storey balcony with view on the [[Alpsee]], while northwards a low chair tower and the conservatory protract from the main structure.  The entire {{not a typo|Palas}} is spangled with numerous decorative chimneys and ornamental turrets, the court front with colourful [[fresco]]s.
The court-side gable is crowned with a copper lion, the western (outward) gable with the likeness of a knight.

===Interior===

[[File:Neuschwanstein Gang.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Corridor]]
[[File:Neuschwanstein Boden.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Throne Hall detail]]
Had it been completed, the palace would have had more than 200 interior rooms, including premises for guests and servants, as well as for service and logistics. Ultimately, no more than about 15 rooms and halls were finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;NP117&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Parkyn|2002|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its lower stories the {{not a typo|Palas}} accommodates administrative and servants' rooms and the rooms of today's palace administration.  The king's staterooms are situated in the upper stories: The anterior structure accommodates the lodgings in the third floor, above them the ''Hall of the Singers''. The upper floors of the west-facing posterior structure are filled almost completely by the Throne Hall. The total floor space of all floors amounts to nearly {{convert|6000|m2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NP117&quot; /&gt;

Neuschwanstein houses numerous significant interior rooms of German [[historicism]]. The palace was fitted with several of the latest technical innovations of the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN212&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Neuschwanstein Castle: Interior and modern technology|url=http://www.neuschwanstein.de/englisch/palace/interior.htm|accessdate=2010-03-11|publisher=[[Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes|Bavarian Palace Department]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other things it had a battery-powered bell system for the servants and telephone lines.  The kitchen equipment included a [[Rumford fireplace|Rumford oven]] that turned the skewer with its heat and so automatically adjusted the turning speed. The hot air was used for a [[Calorifère heating|calorifère central heating]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;RL6484&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Linnenkamp|1986|pp=64,&amp;nbsp;84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further novelties for the era were running warm water and toilets with automatic flushing.

The largest room of the palace by area is the Hall of the Singers, followed by the Throne Hall.  The {{convert|27|by|10|m|ft|adj=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koch von Berneck|1887|p=47}} (measurements do not take into account gallery and Sängerlaube)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hall of the Singers is located in the eastern, court-side wing of the {{not a typo|Palas}}, in the fourth floor above the king's lodgings.  It is designed as an amalgamation of two rooms of the Wartburg: The Hall of the Singers and the Ballroom. It was one of the king's favorite projects for his palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN48&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rectangular room was decorated with themes from Lohengrin and [[Parzival]].  Its longer side is terminated by a gallery that is crowned by a tribune, modelled after the Wartburg.  The eastern narrow side is terminated by a stage that is structured by arcades and known as the ''sängerlaube''.  The Hall of the Singers was never designed for court festivities of the reclusive king.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  Rather, like the Throne Hall it served as a walkable monument in which the culture of knights and [[courtly love]] of the Middle Ages was represented.  The first performance in this hall took place in 1933: A concert commemorating the 50th anniversary of Richard Wagner's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;RL171&quot; /&gt;

The Throne Hall, {{convert|20|by|12|m|ft}},&lt;ref name=&quot;berneck45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Koch von Berneck|1887|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; is situated in the west wing of the {{not a typo|Palas}}. With its height of {{convert|13|m}}&lt;ref name=&quot;berneck45&quot; /&gt; it occupies the third and fourth floors.  [[Julius Hofmann]] modelled it after the [[Allerheiligen-Hofkirche]] in the [[Munich Residenz]].  On three sides it is surrounded by colorful arcades, ending in an [[apse]] that was intended to hold Ludwig's throne{{spaced ndash}}which was never completed.  &lt;!--LEGACY START--&gt;The throne [[dais]] is surrounded by paintings of Jesus, the [[Twelve Apostles]] and six [[canonized]] kings.&lt;!--LEGACY END--&gt;  The [[mural painting]]s were created by [[Wilhelm Hauschild (painter)|Wilhelm Hauschild]].  The floor mosaic was completed after the king's death. The chandelier is fashioned after a Byzantine crown.  The Throne Hall makes a sacral impression. Following the king's wish, it amalgamated the Grail Hall from Parzival with a symbol of the [[divine right of kings]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN16&quot; /&gt; an incorporation of unrestricted sovereign power, which Ludwig as the head of a [[constitutional monarchy]] no longer held. The union of the sacral and regal is emphasized by the portraits in the apse of six canonized kings: [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] of France, [[Saint Stephen of Hungary]], Saint [[Edward the Confessor]] of England, [[Saint Wenceslaus]] of Bohemia, [[Saint Olaf]] of Norway and [[Emperor Henry II|Saint Henry]], Holy Roman Emperor.

Apart from the large ceremonial rooms several smaller rooms were created for use by Ludwig II.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN26&quot; /&gt;  The royal lodging is on the third floor of the palace in the east wing of the {{not a typo|Palas}}.  It consists of eight rooms with living space and several smaller rooms.  In spite of the gaudy décor, the living space with its moderate room size and its sofas and suites makes a relatively modern impression on today's visitors.  Ludwig II did not attach importance to representative requirements of former times, in which the life of a monarch was mostly public.  The interior decoration with mural paintings, [[tapestry]], furniture and other handicraft generally refers to the king's favorite themes: the [[holy grail|grail legend]], the works of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], and their interpretation by Richard Wagner.

[[File:Neuschwanstein&amp;nbsp;– Tropfsteingrotte in der Wohnung des Königs.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Grotto]]
The eastward drawing room is adorned with themes from the Lohengrin legend.  The furniture{{spaced ndash}}sofa, table, armchairs and seats in a northward [[alcove]]{{spaced ndash}}is comfortable and homelike.  Next to the drawing room is a little artificial [[grotto]] that forms the passage to the study.  The unusual room, originally equipped with an [[artificial waterfall]] and a so-called rainbow machine, is connected to a little [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]].  Depicting the [[Venusberg (mythology)|Hörselberg]] grotto, it relates to Wagner's ''Tannhäuser'', as does the décor of the adjacent study.  In the park of Linderhof Palace the king had installed a similar grotto of greater dimensions. Opposite the study follows the dining room, adorned with themes of courtly love.  Since the kitchen in Neuschwanstein is situated three stories below the dining room, it was impossible to install a wishing table (dining table disappearing by means of a mechanism) as at Linderhof Palace and Herrenchiemsee.  Instead, the dining room was connected with the kitchen by means of a service lift.

The bedroom adjacent to the dining room and the subsequent house chapel are the only rooms of the palace that remain in neo-Gothic style.  The king's bedroom is dominated by a huge bed adorned with carvings.  Fourteen carvers worked more than four years on the bed canopy with its numerous [[pinnacle]]s and on the oaken panelings.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN113&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blunt|1970|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this room that Ludwig was arrested in the night from 11 to 12 June 1886. The adjacent little house chapel is consecrated to [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]], after whom the owner was named.

The servants' rooms in the basement of the {{not a typo|Palas}} are quite scantily equipped with massive oak furniture. Besides one table and one cabinet there are two beds of {{convert|1.80|m}} length each.  Opaque glass windows separated the rooms from the corridor that connects the exterior stairs with the main stairs, so that the king could enter and leave unseen.  The servants were not allowed to use the main stairs, but were restricted to the much narrower and steeper servants' stairs.

The king's wishes and demands expanded during the construction of Neuschwanstein, and so did the expenses. Drafts and estimated costs were revised repeatedly.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR13&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rauch|1991|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially a modest study was planned instead of the great throne hall, and projected guest rooms were struck from the drafts to make place for a ''Moorish Hall'', which could not be realized due to lack of resources.  Completion was originally projected for 1872, but deferred repeatedly.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR13&quot; /&gt;

Neuschwanstein, the symbolic [[medieval]] knight's castle, was not Ludwig II's only huge construction project. It was followed by the [[rococo]] style [[Lustschloss]] of [[Linderhof Palace]] and the [[baroque]] palace of [[Herrenchiemsee]], a monument to the era of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN110&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blunt|1970|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linderhof, the smallest of the projects, was finished in 1886, and the other two remain incomplete. All three projects together drained his resources.  The king paid for his construction projects by private means and from his [[civil list]] income. Contrary to frequent claims, the Bavarian treasury was not directly burdened by his buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN19&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RL171&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Linnenkamp|1986|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1871, Ludwig had an additional secret income in return for a political favor given to [[Otto von Bismarck]].&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;In November 1870 Ludwig signed the [[Kaiserbrief]], a letter drafted by Bismarck to the other sovereigns of the German states, asking them to crown the Prussian King [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] as [[Kaiser]]. In return, Ludwig received secret payments out of Bismarck's secret account, the [[Welfenfonds]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction costs of Neuschwanstein in the king's lifetime amounted to 6.2 million [[German gold mark|marks]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MPB65&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Bunz|1995|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost twice the initial cost estimate of 3.2 million marks.&lt;ref name=&quot;RL171&quot; /&gt;  As his private means were insufficient for his increasingly escalating construction projects, the king continuously opened new lines of credit.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bitterauf|1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1876, a [[court counselor]] was replaced after pointing out the danger of insolvency.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoswho&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1883 he already owed 7 million marks,&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blunt|1970|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in spring 1884 and August 1885 debt conversions of {{frac|7|1|2}} million marks and {{frac|6|1|2}} million marks, respectively, became necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt;

Even after his debts had reached 14 million marks, Ludwig insisted on continuation of his architectural projects; he threatened suicide if his creditors seized his palaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoswho&quot; /&gt; In early 1886, Ludwig asked his cabinet for a credit of 6 million marks, which was denied.  In April, he followed Bismarck's advice to apply for the money to his parliament.  In June the Bavarian government decided to depose the king, who was living at Neuschwanstein at the time.  On June 9 he was incapacitated, and on June 10 he had the deposition commission arrested in the gatehouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In expectation of the commission, he alerted the gendarmerie and fire brigades of surrounding places for his protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB&quot; /&gt; A second commission headed by [[Bernhard von Gudden]] arrived on the next day, and the king was forced to leave the palace that night.  Ludwig was put under the supervision of von Gudden.  On June 13, both died under mysterious circumstances in the shallow shore water of [[Lake Starnberg]] near [[Castle Berg (Lake Starnberg)|Castle Berg]].

==After Ludwig's death==
At the time of Ludwig's death the palace was far from complete.  The external structures of the Gatehouse and the {{not a typo|Palas}} were mostly finished, but the Rectangular Tower was still scaffolded. Work on the Bower had not started, but was completed{{by whom |date=September 2012}} in simplified form by 1892, without the planned female saints figures.  The Knights' House was also simplified. In Ludwig's plans the columns in the Knights' House gallery were held as tree trunks and the capitals as the corresponding crowns.  Only the foundations existed for the core piece of the palace complex: a [[keep]] of {{convert|90|m}} height planned in the upper courtyard, resting on a three-[[nave]] chapel. This was not realized,&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN12&quot; /&gt; and a connection wing between the Gatehouse and the Bower saw the same fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans for a castle garden with terraces and a fountain west of the {{not a typo|Palas}} were also abandoned after the king's death.

[[File:Neuschwanstein1886 2.jpg|thumb|Neuschwanstein in 1886]]

The interior of the royal living space in the palace was mostly completed in 1886; the lobbies and corridors were painted in a simpler style by 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Moorish Hall'' desired by the king (and planned below the Throne Hall) was not realized any more than the so-called ''Knights' Bath'', which, modeled after the Knights' Bath in the Wartburg, was intended to render homage to the knights' cult as a medieval baptism bath.  A ''Bride Chamber'' in the Bower (after a location in ''Lohengrin''),&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN9&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Petzet|Hojer|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  guest rooms in the first and second floor of the {{not a typo|Palas}} and a great banquet hall were further abandoned projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR13&quot; /&gt;  In fact, a complete development of Neuschwanstein had never even been planned, and at the time of the king's death there was not a utilization concept for numerous rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR14&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Neuschwanstein Castle LOC print rotated.jpg|thumb|Neuschwanstein front façade and surroundings ([[photochrom]] print, c. 1900)]]

When Ludwig II died in 1886, Neuschwanstein was still incomplete.  The king never intended to make the palace accessible to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFSN19&quot; /&gt; But no more than six weeks after the king's death the regent [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]] ordered the palace opened to paying visitors. The administrators of Ludwig's estate managed to balance the construction debts by 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rauch|1991|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then until [[World War I]], Neuschwanstein was a stable and lucrative source of revenue for the [[House of Wittelsbach]], indeed Ludwig's castles were probably the single largest income source earned by the Bavarian royal family in the last years prior to 1914. To guarantee a smooth course of visits, some rooms and the court buildings were finished first. Initially the visitors were allowed to move freely in the palace, causing the furniture to wear quickly.

When Bavaria became a republic in 1918, the government socialized the [[civil list]]. The resulting dispute with the House of Wittelsbach led to a split in 1923: Ludwig's palaces including Neuschwanstein fell to the state and are now managed by the [[Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes|Bavarian Palace Department]], a division of the Bavarian finance ministry. Nearby Hohenschwangau Castle fell to the [[Wittelsbacher Ausgleichsfonds]], whose revenues go to the House of Wittelsbach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykora32f&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sykora|2004|p=32f}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visitor numbers continued to rise, reaching 200,000 in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykora32f&quot; /&gt;

Due to its secluded location, the palace survived the two World Wars without destruction.  Under the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories ([[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] für die Besetzen Gebiete), a suborganization of the [[Nazi Party]], it served until 1944 as a depot for [[Nazi plunder]] from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farmer|2002|pp=140f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of art were catalogued photographically. (After [[World War II]] 39 photo albums were found in the palace, documenting the dimension of the robbery. The albums are now stored in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|United States National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|National Archives|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

At the end of the war the [[Reichsbank|German Reichsbank]] deposited gold in the palace, which in the last days of the war was taken to an unknown place.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}

In April 1945, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] considered blowing up the palace to prevent the building itself and the artwork it contained from falling to the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;RL184185&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Linnenkamp|1986|pp=184f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the plan was not realized by the [[Gruppenführer|SS-''Gruppenführer'']] who had been assigned the task, and at the end of the war the palace was surrendered undamaged to representatives of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;RL184185&quot; /&gt;  Thereafter the Bavarian archives used some of the rooms as a provisional store for salvaged archivalia, as the premises in Munich had been bombed.

Neuschwanstein is a global symbol of the era of [[Romanticism]]. The palace served as a model for the [[Sleeping Beauty's Castle]] of [[Disneyland]] and became a location for films such as [[Helmut Käutner]]'s ''[[Ludwig II: Glanz und Ende eines Königs|Ludwig II]]'' (1955), [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Ludwig (film)|Ludwig]]'' (1972) and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' (1968).&lt;!-- By listing all such films the article could be doubled in size, so please don't extend the list. Two examples are enough. --&gt;

[[File:DBP 1977 916 Schloss Neuschwanstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|West German stamp (1977)]]
In 1977, Neuschwanstein Castle became the motif of a West German [[definitive stamp]], and it is to appear on a €2 commemorative coin for the [[German Bundesländer commemorative coin|German Bundesländer series]] in 2012.  In 2007, it was a finalist in the widely publicized on-line selection of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatton|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The palace is not on the list of [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]. In 2009, a plan was discussed to make it a transnational candidate jointly with Ludwig's Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee palaces and two similar palaces in [[Romania]]: [[Peleş Castle]] and [[Pelişor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biedermann|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, with 1.3 million visitors per year Neuschwanstein is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;internet&quot; /&gt; For security reasons the palace can only be visited during a 35-minute guided tour. There are also special guided tours that focus on specific topics.  In the peak season from June until August, Neuschwanstein has up to 6000 visitors per day, and guests without advance reservation may have to wait several hours. Ticket sales are processed exclusively via the ticket centre in Hohenschwangau.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2008, the total number of visitors was more than 60 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;premiummarke&quot; /&gt;
In 2004, the revenues were booked as €6.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;50million&quot; /&gt;

A [[meteorite]] that reached Earth spectacularly on April 6, 2002, at the Austrian border near Hohenschwangau was named ''Neuschwanstein'' after the palace. Three fragments were found: ''Neuschwanstein I'' ({{convert|1.75|kg|abbr=on}}, found July 2002) and ''Neuschwanstein II'' ({{convert|1.63|kg|abbr=on}}, found May 2003) on the German side, and ''Neuschwanstein III'' ({{convert|2.84|kg|abbr=on}}, found June 2003) on the Austrian side near [[Reutte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heinlein17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heinlein|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meteorite is classified as an [[enstatite chondrite]] with unusually large proportions of pure [[iron]] (29%), [[enstatite]] and the extremely rare mineral [[sinoite]] (Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name=&quot;heinlein29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heinlein|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bavarian Forest''' ([[German language|German]]: ''{{Audio|De-Bayerischer_Wald.ogg|Bayerischer Wald}}'') is a wooded low-mountain region in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It extends along the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border and is continued on the Czech side by the [[Bohemian Forest|Šumava]] (Bohemian Forest). Geographically the Bavarian Forest and Bohemian Forest are sections of the same mountain range. A part of the Bavarian Forest belongs to the '''Bavarian Forest National Park''' (''Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald'') (240&amp;nbsp;km²), established in 1970 as the first national park in Germany. Another 3,008&amp;nbsp;km² belong to the [[Bavarian Forest Nature Park]] (''Naturpark Bayerischer Wald''), established 1967, and 1738&amp;nbsp;km² to the [[Eastern Bavarian Forest Nature Park]] (''Naturpark Oberer Bayerischer Wald''), established 1965. The Bavarian Forest is a remnant of the [[Hercynian Forest]] that stretched across southern [[Germania]] in Roman times. It is the largest protected forest area in central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=103&amp;article=67056 |title=Bavarian Forest delights with nature’s elegant artistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The highest mountain in the region is the [[Großer Arber]] (&quot;Great Arber&quot;, 1,456&amp;nbsp;m). The main river is the [[Regen river|Regen]], which is formed by the conjunction of White Regen and Black Regen and leaves the mountains towards the city of [[Regensburg]].

'''Sylt''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzʏlt}}; {{lang-da|Sild}}; [[Söl'ring|Söl'ring North Frisian]]: ''Söl' '') is an island in northern [[Germany]], part of [[Nordfriesland]] district, [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and well known for the distinctive shape of its shoreline. It belongs to the [[North Frisian Islands]] and is the largest island in [[North Frisia]]. The northernmost island of Germany, it is known for its tourist resorts, notably [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]], [[Kampen, Germany|Kampen]] and [[Wenningstedt-Braderup]], as well as for its 40&amp;nbsp;km long sandy beach. It is frequently covered by the media in connection with its exposed situation in the [[North Sea]] and its ongoing loss of land during [[Storm tides of the North Sea|storm tides]]. Since 1927, Sylt has been connected to the mainland by the [[Hindenburgdamm]] causeway. In latter years, it has been a resort for the German jet set and tourists in search of occasional celebrity sighting.

== Geography ==
[[File:SyltSat.jpg|thumb|left|satellite image of Sylt]]
With 99.14&amp;nbsp;km², Sylt is the fourth-largest [[Islands of Germany|German island]] and the largest German [[North Sea]] island. Sylt is situated at 9 to 16&amp;nbsp;km off the mainland, being connected there by the Hindenburgdamm. Southeast of Sylt the islands [[Föhr]] and [[Amrum]] are located, to the north lies the [[Denmark|Danish]] island [[Rømø]]. The island of Sylt extends for 38&amp;nbsp;km in a north-south direction and on its northern peak at ''Königshafen'' is only 320 m wide. Its widest distance, from the town of Westerland in the west to the eastern ''Nössespitze'' near Morsum, measures 12.6&amp;nbsp;km. On the western and northwestern shore a 40&amp;nbsp;km sand beach is located, east of Sylt the [[Wadden Sea]] is situated, which belongs to the [[Wadden Sea National Parks|Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park]] and mostly falls dry during low [[tide]].

The island's shape has constantly shifted over time, a process which is still ongoing today. The northern and southern [[Spit (landform)|spits]] of Sylt are exclusively made up of infertile sand deposits, while the central part with the municipalities of [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]], [[Wenningstedt-Braderup]] and [[Sylt-Ost]] consists of a [[geestland]] core, which becomes apparent in the form of the Red Cliff of Wenningstedt. The geestland facing the Wadden Sea gradually turns into fertile [[marshland]] around Sylt-Ost. Today sources show that Sylt has only been an island since the ''[[Grote Mandrenke]]'' flood of 1362.&lt;ref name=&quot;TU Berlin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tu-berlin.de/~kehl/project/lv-twk/002-sylt.htm|title=Entstehung der Insel Sylt im Laufe von 700 Jahren|author=Kehl, H.|publisher=Institute of Ecology, [[Technical University Berlin]]|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called ''Uwe-Düne'' (Uwe Dune) is the island's highest elevation with 52.5 m above sea level.

On Sylt a [[marine climate]] influenced by the [[Gulf stream]] is predominant. With an average of 2 °C, winter months are slightly milder than on the mainland, summer months though with a median of 17 °C are somewhat cooler, despite a longer sunshine period on Sylt. The annual average sunshine period of Sylt is 4.4 hours per day. It is due to the low relief of the shoreline that Sylt had a total of 1899 hours of sunshine in 2005, 180 hours above the German average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerland.de/fileroot/service/download/Tourismusstatistik2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tourimusstatistik 2005|language=German|publisher=Town of Westerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clouds cannot accumulate as quickly and are generally scattered by the constant westerly or northwesterly winds.

The annual mean temperature is 8.5 °C. The annually averaged wind speed measures 6.7&amp;nbsp;m/s, predominantly from western directions. The annual rainfall amounts to about 650 millimetres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Deutschland/list2.html|title=List auf Sylt (climate chart)|publisher=Bernhard Mühr|date=1 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937 weather data are collected at [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]'s northernmost station on a dune near [[List, Germany|List]], which has meanwhile become automated. A number of commercial meteorological services like [[Meteomedia AG]] operate stations in List too.

The island in its current form has only existed for about 400 years. Like the mainland [[geestland]], it was formed of [[moraine]]s from the older [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]], thus being made up of a [[till]] core, which is now apparent in the island's west and centre by the cliff, dunes and beach. This sandy core began to [[erosion|erode]] as it was exposed to a strong current along the island's steep basement when the sea level rose 8000 years ago. During the process, [[sediment]]s were accumulated north and south of the island. The west coast, which was originally situated 10&amp;nbsp;km off today's shore, was thus gradually moved eastward, while at the same time the island began to extend to the north and south. After the ice ages, marshland began to form around this geestland core.

In 1141, Sylt is recorded as an island, yet before the ''[[Grote Mandrenke]]'' flood it belonged to a landscape cut by [[tidal creek]]s and at least during low tide it could be reached on foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;TU Berlin&quot; /&gt; Only since this flood has the creation of a [[spit (landform)|spit]] from sediments begun to form the current characteristical shape of Sylt. Thereby mainly the northern and southern edges of Sylt were and still are the subject of great change. For example Listland was separated from the rest of the island in the 14th century and from the later 17th century onwards the ''Königshafen'' (King's Harbour) began to silt up as the &quot;elbow&quot; spit began to form.&lt;ref name=geomar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iczm.de/geomarab.pdf|title=Klimaänderung und Küste – Fallstudie Sylt|language=German|author=Thiede, J; K. Ahrendt|year=2000|publisher=GEOMAR, [[University of Kiel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the constant loss of land, the inhabitants during the [[Little Ice Age]] were constrained by [[sand drift]]. Dunes shifting to the east threatened settlements and arable land and had to be stopped by the planting of [[marram grass]] in the 18th century. Consequently though, material breaking off the island was increasingly washed away and the island's extent continued to decrease.

Record of the annual land loss exist since 1870. According to them, Sylt lost an annual 0.4 m of land in the north and 0.7 m in the south from 1870 to 1951. From 1951 to 1984, the rate increased to 0.9 and 1.4 m respectively, while shorelines at the island's very edges at Hörnum and List are even more affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Umweltatlas Wattenmeer (Wadden Sea environmental Atlas)|editor=Landesamt für den Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer, Umweltbundesamt|volume=I – Nordfriesisches und Dithmarscher Wattenmeer|location=Stuttgart|year=1998|page=38|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe storm surges of the last decades have repeatedly endangered Sylt to the point of breaking in two, e.g. Hörnum was temporarily cut off from the island in 1962. Part of the island near Rantum which is only 500m wide is especially threatened.

[[File:2002-07 Sylt - Groyne.jpg|thumb|An armoured concrete groyne at Westerland]]
[[File:Sylt fg01.jpg|thumb|Concrete tetrapods in Westerland]]
[[File:Dünenstrand auf Sylt.jpg|thumb|Sand dunes near List]]
[[Coastal management|Measures of protection]] against the continuous erosion date back to the early 19th century when [[groyne]]s of wooden poles were constructed. Those were built at right angles into the sea from the coast line. Later they were replaced by metal and eventually by armoured concrete groynes. The constructions did not have the desired effect of stopping the erosion caused by crossways currents. &quot;[[Windward and leeward|Leeward]] erosion&quot;, i.e. erosion on the downwind side of the groynes prevented sustainable accumulation of sand.

In the 1960s breaking the power of the sea was attempted by installing [[Tetrapod (structure)|tetrapods]] along the groyne bases or by putting them into the sea like groynes. The four-armed structures, built in France and many tons in weight were too heavy for Sylt's beaches and were equally unable to prevent erosion. Therefore they were removed from the Hörnum west beach in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auf.uni-rostock.de/uiw/b7/Projekte/iwr_fallstudie_sylt_abschlussbericht.pdf|format=PDF| title=Fallstudie Sylt|publisher=[[University of Rostock]]|author=Witte, J.-O.; Kohlhase, Sören, J. Radomski, P. Fröhle|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1970s the only effective means so far has been flushing sand onto the shore. [[Dredging]] vessels are used to pump a mixture of sand and water to a beach where it is spread by bulldozers. Thus storm floods would only erase the artificial accumulation of sand, while the shoreline proper remains intact and erosion is slowed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Küstenschutz: Bisherige und zukünftige Maßnahmen|url=http://www.tu-harburg.de/wb/mitarbeiter/lieberman/veroeffentlichungen/58.pdf|format=PDF|author=Von Liebermann, Nicole|publisher=Technical University of Harburg|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure incurs considerable costs. The required budget of an annual [[Euro|€]]10 million is currently provided by federal German, Schleswig-Holstein state and EU funds. Since 1972 an estimated 35.5 million cubic metres of sand have been flushed ashore and dumped on Sylt. The measures have so far cost more than €134 million in total, but according to scientific calculations they are sufficient to prevent further loss of land for at least three decades, so the benefits for the island's economic power and for the economically underdeveloped region in general would outweigh the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sterr.geographie.uni-kiel.de/Daschkeit/downloads/Daschkeit-Sterr-2005-Sylt.pdf|title=Edition Humanökologie|chapter=Küste, Ökologie und Mensch, Integriertes Küstenmanagement als Instrument nachhaltiger Entwicklung|last=Daschkeit|first=Achim|coauthors=Horst Sterr|editor=Bernhard Glaeser|volume=2|publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft für Humanökologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1995 study ''Klimafolgen für Mensch und Küste am Beispiel der Nordseeinsel Sylt'' (Climate impact for Man and Shores as seen on the North Sea island Sylt) it reads: ''&quot;Hätte Sylt nicht das Image einer attraktiven Ferieninsel, gäbe es den Küstenschutz in der bestehenden Form gewiss nicht&quot;'' (If Sylt did not have the image of an attractive holiday island, coastal management in its current form would certainly not exist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Klimafolgen für Mensch und Küste am Beispiel der Nordseeinsel Sylt|first=Achim|last=Daschkeit|coauthors=Peter Schottes|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=2002|language=German|isbn=978-3-540-42569-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enforcement of a natural [[reef]] off Sylt is being discussed as an alternative solution. A first experiment was conducted from 1996 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stiftung-deutscher-kuestenschutz.de/projects/preistraeger/2004/bleck_kuenstliche_riffe.pdf|format=PDF|title=Funktionale Bemessung künstlicher Riffe für aktiven und sanften Küstenschutz|author=Bleck, Matthias|publisher=Stiftung deutscher Küstenschutz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sand drainage as being successfully used on Danish islands is not likely to work on Sylt owing to the underwater slope here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sand auf Sylt|url=http://www.uni-kiel.de/med-klimatologie/pdftexte/sand.pdf|format=PDF|author=Newig, J.|publisher=University of Kiel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel to the ongoing sand flushing, the deliberate demolition of groynes has begun amid great effort at certain beach sections where they were proven largely ineffective. This measure also terminated the presumably most famous groyne of Sylt, ''Buhne 16'' — the namesake of the local naturist beach.

A number of experts, however, fears that Sylt will still have to face considerable losses of land until the mid 21st century. The continuous [[global warming]] is thought to result in increasing storm activity, which would result in increased land loss and, as a first impact, might mean the end of property insurance. Measurements showed that, unlike in former times, the wave energy of the sea is no longer lost offshore, today it carries its destructive effects on to the beaches proper. This will result in an annual loss of sand of 1.1 million m³.&lt;ref name=geomar /&gt;
The dunes of the island constitute [[nature reserve]]s and may only be traversed on marked tracks. So called &quot;wild paths&quot; promote erosion and are not to be followed. Where vegetation is tread upon, no roots are left to hold the sand and it will be removed by wind and water.

The [[Wadden Sea]] on the east side between Sylt and the mainland has been a nature reserve and [[bird sanctuary]] since 1935 and is part of the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. The construction of breakwaters in this area will abate sedimentation and is used for [[land reclamation]].

Also the grazing of sheep on the sea dikes and heaths of Sylt eventually serves coastal management, since the animals keep the vegetation short and compress the soil with their hooves. Thus they help create a denser dike surface, which in case of storm surges provides less area for the waves to impact.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Flower dsc05303.jpg|thumb|Rosa rugosa, known as &quot;Sylt rose&quot; on the island]]
The [[flora]] of Sylt is shaped by the island's original sparseness. Until the mid 19th century Sylt was an island almost completely devoid of trees, only artificial plantations created small areas of forest and bush. Still today one can recognize the man-made structure of the ''Friedrichshain'' and ''Südwäldchen'' forests in Westerland, the trees mostly standing in rank and file. Also the now widespread rose [[Rosa rugosa]], known as the &quot;Sylt rose&quot; on the island was only imported to Sylt. It originates from the [[Kamchatka]] peninsula in [[Siberia]]. The undemanding rose met ideal conditions on Sylt and spread so quickly that it is now a common sight on the island. Its proliferation is viewed critically from a biological point of view, since it threatens to displace endangered local species, especially on the heaths.&lt;ref name=braderup&gt;{{cite web|title=Interessantes über die Braderuper Heide|url=http://www.naturschutz-sylt.de/NSG_gebiete_heide.html|language=German|publisher=Naturschutzgemeinschaft Sylt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ample [[Heath (habitat)|heaths]] on the eastern side of the island provide habitats for many rare species of plants and animals which are adapted to the extreme conditions such as drought, warmth, wind. About 2,500 animal species and 150 species of plants have so far been recorded. 45% of those plants are on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=braderup /&gt; Especially notable are the 600 species of [[butterfly|butterflies]] that live in the heaths, [[Small Tortoiseshell]], [[Brimstone (butterfly)|Brimstone]], [[Painted Lady]] and [[Inachis io|Peacock butterfly]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morsum-Kliff|url=http://www.naturschutz-sylt.de/NSG_gebiete_morsum.html|language=German|publisher=Naturschutzgemeinschaft Sylt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several thousand individuals in the dune belt of Sylt, the [[Natterjack Toad]], endangered in Germany, has one of Germany's largest populations here. Their spawning places are wet dune slacks and shallow, short-lived pools. For a habitat they prefer sandy areas with vegetation. The main threat for this species on Sylt is road traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Die Amphibien und Reptilien Schleswig-Holsteins, Rote Liste|url=http://www.umweltdaten.landsh.de/nuis/upool/gesamt/amphibien/rl_amphibien.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Schleswig-Holstein State Office for Nature and Environment|author=Klinge, Andreas|version=3rd version|language=German|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many [[water bird]]s and other coastal avians, that have their hatching grounds on Sylt or use the island for resting on their [[Migratory bird|migrations]] constitute an [[Ornithology|ornithological]] feature. There are two notable hatching areas on Sylt, the ''Königshafen'' bay with the small island [[Uthörn]] in the north and the Rantum basin in the southeast. Birds that hatch on Sylt include [[Black-headed Gull]], [[Arctic Tern]], [[Pied Avocet]], [[Common Redshank]], [[Common Gull]], [[Oystercatcher]], [[Northern Lapwing]], [[Common Shelduck]] and [[Tufted Duck]]. During the migration, Sylt is a resting spot for thousands of [[Brent Goose|Brent Geese]] and Shelducks, [[Eurasian Wigeon]]s and [[Common Eider]]s, as well as [[Bar-tailed Godwit]]s, [[Red knot]]s, [[Dunlin]]s and [[Eurasian Golden Plover]]s. [[Ringed Plover]], [[Common Snipe]], [[Ruff]] and other species are less common visitors to the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M.|last=Lohmann|coauthors=K. Haarmann|title=Vogelparadiese|volume=1 – Norddeutschland|language=German|publisher=Paul Parey|isbn=3-490-16418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding land [[mammal]]s, there is no significant difference from the neighbouring areas of mainland Nordfriesland. Primarily [[European Hare]], [[European Rabbit|Rabbit]] and [[Roe deer]] can be found and are also hunted as game on the island. When the island was connected to the mainland by the causeway [[fox]] and [[badger]] also became common.

West of Sylt a breeding area of [[Harbour Porpoise]]s is located. In addition, great numbers of [[Harbour Seal]]s and [[Grey Seal]]s, the latter being rather uncommon in German seas, can be found on sand banks off Sylt.

Numerous associations and societies that care for the exploration and the protection of endangered animals and plants have their branches on Sylt. Among them are the [[Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], Verein Jordsand and [[Wadden Sea Conservation Station]]. Also the Federal Office for the Environment operates a research station in the dunes at Westerland.

==Climate==
Sylt features an [[oceanic climate]] that is influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]]. On average, the winter season is slightly warmer than in mainland Nordfriesland. The summer season, however, is cooler despite of longer sunshine periods. The yearly average sunshine period is greater than 4.4 hours per day with some years exceeding the average sunshine for all of Germany. Also precipitation is lower than on the mainland. This is due to the low relief of Sylt's shoreline where clouds are not able to accumulate and rain off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Das Wetter auf Sylt: viel Sonne und eine frische Brise |trans_title=The Weather on Sylt: A lot of Sunshine and a fresh Breeze |language=German |work=[[Die Zeit|Zeit Reisen]] |accessdate=23 October 2012 |url=http://zeitreisen.zeit.de/ratgeber/deutschland/sylt/das-wetter-auf-sylt-viel-sonne-und-eine-frische-brise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylt is divided into two administrative bodies: the ''[[Amt (administrative division)|Amt]]'' [[Landschaft Sylt]] with its seat in Keitum administrates all municipalities on the island, save for the independent town of [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]]. As of December 2007, Sylt had 21,190 inhabitants, 9,072 of whom living in Westerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orte, Städte, Gemeinden im Landkreis Nordfriesland|url=http://www.daeb.de/schleswig-holstein/nordsee/nordfriesland.php|publisher=Deutschland auf einen Blick|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers do not include owners of summer residences.

A referendum held in May 2008 resulted in a merger of the [[Sylt-Ost]] municipality with the town of Westerland due 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sylter Rundschau|url=http://www.shz.de/lokales/sylter-rundschau/artikeldetails/article/789/westerland-und-sylt-ost-fusionieren-1.html|title=Westerland und Sylt-Ost fusionieren|date=26 May 2008|publisher=Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups of interest are hoping to fuse all municipalities on the island into a single governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sylter Rundschau|url=http://www.shz.de/lokales/sylter-rundschau/artikeldetails/article/789/der-fahrplan-zur-teilfusion-so-geht-es-jetzt-weiter.html|title=Der Fahrplan zur Teilfusion: So geht es jetzt weiter|date=27 May 2008|publisher=Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlements along the west coast===
Six municipalities are situated along the west coast of Sylt. [[List, Schleswig-Holstein|List]] in the very north of the island constitutes Germany's northernmost municipality, it retained a certain independence due to its remote location and its long-time adherence to the kingdom of [[Denmark]]. On its eastern shore, a harbour is located where, in addition to tourist ships, the &quot;Sylt-Express&quot; ferry-boat sails to Havneby on the Danish island [[Rømø]]. [[Wenningstedt-Braderup|Wenningstedt]] together with Braderup and [[Kampen, Germany|Kampen]] used to form the Norddörfer (Northern Villages) municipality, an early intercommunal association, which partly remains today in form of a school union. While Kampen, mainly in the 1950s and 1960s was famous  in Germany for attracting celebrities, Wenningstedt is known as a &quot;family resort&quot; for more than 100 years. Since 1855, the prominent black and white [[Kampen lighthouse, Sylt|Kampen lighthouse]] is located between Kampen and Wenningstedt, it is the oldest one on the island. East of there, the &quot;Braderuper Heide&quot; nature reserve is situated. Right south of Wenningstedt are the town limits of the island's metropolis, Westerland.

After the complete destruction of the village Eidum by a storm surge on 1 November 1436, the survivors founded a new village northeast of their old home: Westerland. The name was first recorded in 1462. In 1865 a seaside spa was founded, 50 years later Westerland was granted [[town privileges]]. In 1949 it was finally officially recognised as a health resort. In 2007, the town counted 9,072 citizens.

South of Westerland, the island extends for about 15&amp;nbsp;km in the form of a spit, until it is cut by the ''Hörnumtief'' tidal creek, that runs through the Wadden Sea mudflats east of Sylt. Here is the location of [[Rantum]]. This village, like no other on Sylt, had to fight sand drift during the past centuries. Many farmsteads and a church had to be abandoned because of shifting dunes moving eastward. Only the planting of [[marram grass]] stopped the dunes and put an end to this threat. To the east there are a few scattered spots of marshland, while the area is mostly coined by dunes.

[[Hörnum]] on the island's southern headland is the youngest village, having been founded shortly after 1900. But already in former times the uninhabited southern tip of Sylt was said to serve as refuge for pirates and fishermen. The name ''Budersand'' in the area emanates from that custom, marking a great dune where booths ({{lang-de|Buden}}) stood in former times to serve as shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Max|last=Pahl|title=Hörnum. Heimat am Horn – Querschnitt und Streifzüge durch Geschichte, Leben und Landschaft des Nordseebades Hörnum auf Sylt|language=German|publisher=Verlagsdruckerei Schallhorn|location=Lunden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; This southern headland, called ''Odde'', is marked by continuous loss of land. Each year great amounts of sand are washed away by storm floods and coastal management has not yet seen sustainable effects in the area, so that further losses have to be expected.

=== Sylt-Ost ===
Sylt-Ost (''East Sylt'') is a township, consisting of several small villages on the ''Nössehalbinsel'' on Sylt. The population (as of 2000) is 5,500. The villages include Tinnum, Munkmarsch, Archsum, Morsum and Keitum.

==== Tinnum ====
''Tinnum castle'' (''Tinnumburg'') is a circular parapet with a diameter of 120 meters and a height of 8 meters. It was built in the 1st century BC, likely as a pagan holy site.

==== Keitum ====
Keitum has a historical church (''[[St. Severin, Keitum|St. Severin church]]''), dating back to the 13th century. The ''green cliff'' is also located near Keitum. The village has been the economical and social center of the island until tourism started to get higher importance and Westerland, the island's only town, started to expand. From the old days are still many beautiful Frisian houses left which were built by the town's seafarers especially during the days of whale hunting 1650–1850).

==== Munkmarsch ====
[[File:Sylt 05 Frieseenh Munkm.jpg|thumb|Munkmarsch]]
Munkmarsch has been the main port of the Island. Ferries from Hoyer (today in Denmark) landed here. When the &quot;Hindenburg Damm&quot; was finished in the 1920s, the town lost its importance. A marina is today located at the old port.

==== Archsum ====
Of all villages on Sylt, Archsum has the highest percentage of inhabitants still speaking Söl'ring.

==== Morsum ====
Morsum has a historical church (''St. Martin church''), dating back to the same era as the one in Keitum. Morsum is also known for its ''morsum cliff'', that shows the geological history of the last five million years on its height of 21 meters. It has been under landscape conservation since 1893.

== Transport ==
Sylt is connected to the German mainland by the [[Hindenburgdamm]], a [[causeway]] with a railway line on top. The passenger trains connect Westerland to [[Niebüll]] or [[Klanxbüll]], and there is also the option of taking one's car onto the train at Niebüll. Furthermore, Ferry services to the nearby [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Rømø]] exist. Beyond, [[Sylt Airport]] serves the region.

== Culture ==
Sylt is a unique part of Germany, since it is part of the [[Frisian Islands]]. It has its own dialect, [[Söl'ring]], which is the indigenous speech of Sylt. Söl'ring is a unique dialect of insular [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]], with elements of [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]]. Today, only a small fraction of the population still speaks Söl'ring. A law to promote the language („Friesisch-Gesetz“) was passed in 2004. The northernmost part of the island, ''Listland'', was traditionally Danish-speaking.

As in many areas in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] on [[New Year's Eve]], groups of children go masked from house to house, reciting poems. This is known as &quot;Rummelpottlaufen&quot;, and as a reward, children receive sweets and/or money.

Sylt also has unique Frisian-style houses.

== History ==
* Sylt was originally part of [[Jutland Peninsula|Jutland]] (today [[Denmark]] and Schleswig-Holstein)
* There is evidence of human habitation going back to 3000 BC at [[Denghoog]]
* First settlements of Frisians during the 8th century and 9th century
* Sylt was divided between the Duke of Schleswig and the Kingdom of Denmark in 1386
* Except for the town of List, Sylt became part of the Duchy of Schleswig in 1435
* During the 17th century and 18th century, [[whaling]], fishing and [[oyster]] breeding increased the wealth of the population
* Keitum became the capital of the island, and a place for rich captains to settle down
* In the 19th century, tourism began; Westerland replaced Keitum as the capital
* During [[World War I]], Sylt became a military outpost, but did not suffer from war damage
* In 1927, a rail causeway to the mainland was built, the [[Hindenburgdamm]], named after [[Paul von Hindenburg]]
* During [[World War II]], Sylt became a fortress, with concrete bunkers built below the [[dune]]s at the shore, some of which are still visible today. [[Lager Sylt]], the [[concentration camp]] on [[Alderney]] was named after the island.
* When [[Nazi Germany]] lost the war Rudolf Höss hid on the island, but was captured there and brought to trial in Nürnberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/40-45/liberation/|title=Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State.

Today, Sylt is mainly a tourist attraction, famous for its healthy climate, and the many German celebrities who own houses on the island. The beach even has a nude section.

==In other media==
The island was used during the filming of [[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]], as an alternate location for [[Martha's Vineyard]], due to travel restrictions on the film's director, [[Roman Polanski]].

'''Lake Constance''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Bodensee'') is a lake on the [[Rhine]] at the northern foot of the [[Alps]], and consists of three [[Body of water|bodies of water]]: the ''Obersee'' (&quot;upper lake&quot;), the ''Untersee'' (&quot;lower lake&quot;), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the ''Seerhein''.

The lake is situated in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] near the Alps. Specifically, its shorelines lie in the German [[Federal states of Germany|federal states]] of [[Bavaria]] and [[Baden-Württemberg]], the Austrian [[States of Austria|federal state]] of [[Vorarlberg]], and the Swiss [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Thurgau]] and [[St. Gallen]]. The [[Rhine]] flows into it from the south following the Austro-Swiss frontier.

Lake Constance was first mentioned by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] about 43 AD. He noted that the Rhine flows through two lakes, and gave them the [[Latin language|Latin]] names ''Lacus Venetus'' ''(Obersee)'' and ''Lacus Acronius'' ''(Untersee)''. [[Pliny the Elder]] used the name ''Lacus Brigantinus'', after the Roman city of Brigantium (today [[Bregenz]]). The lake is also colloquially known as the ''Swabian Sea''&lt;ref&gt;Gordon McLachlan.  ''The Rough Guide to Germany''. Rough Guides Ltd. London, 2004. ISBN 1-84353-293-X.&lt;/ref&gt; (''das schwäbische Meer'').

The [[freshwater]] lake sits at {{convert|395|m|ft|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]] and is [[Central Europe]]'s third largest, after [[Lake Balaton]] and [[Lake Geneva]]. It is {{convert|63|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and at its widest point, nearly {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It covers approximately {{convert|571|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of total area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mcmaster.ca/maps/fc1999.htm Image #432, Flying Camera Satellite Images 1999], Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, McMaster University Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest depth is {{convert|252|m|ft}} in the middle of the eastern part (Obersee). Its volume is approximately {{convert|1e10|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}}. The lake has four parts: the main section, called Obersee, {{convert|476|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}; the north section, Überlinger See, {{convert|61|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}; the west section, Untersee, {{convert|63|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}; and the northwest section, the Zeller See and Gnadensee. The regulated [[Rhine]] flows into the lake in the southeast, through the Obersee, the city of [[Konstanz]] and the Untersee and flows out near [[Stein am Rhein]]. Lake Constance provides fresh water to many cities in south [[Germany]].

Lake Constance was formed by the [[Rhine Glacier]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] and is a ''[[zungenbecken]]'' lake. The Rhine, the [[Bregenzer Ache]], and the [[Dornbirner Ache]] carry sediments from the [[Alps]] to the lake, thus gradually decreasing the depth of the lake in the southeast.

The lake was frozen in the years 1077 (?), 1326 (partial), 1378 (partial), 1435, 1465 (partial), 1477 (partial), 1491 (partial?), 1517 (partial), 1571 (partial), 1573, 1600 (partial), 1684, 1695, 1709 (partial), 1795, 1830, 1880 (partial), and 1963.

Approximately {{convert|1000|t|ST|lk=on}} of fish were caught by 150 professional fishermen in 2001 which was below the previous ten year average of {{convert|1200|t|ST}} per year. The Lake Constance [[Brown trout|trout]] (''Salmo trutta'') was almost extinct in the 1980s due to pollution, but thanks to protective measures has made a significant return. Lake Constance was the home of the now [[extinct]] species of trout ''[[Salvelinus profundus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/135539/0 IUCN Red list]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of the Lake Constance whitefish ''([[Coregonus gutturosus]])''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfn.de/0322_rote-liste-wirbeltiere+M52087573ab0.html Red List - Volume 1: Vertebrates (2009) - General assessment for the vertebrate groups]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake itself is an important drinking water source for southwestern Germany, called ''Bodensee-Wasserversorgung'' (&quot;Lake Constance Water Supply&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bodensee-Wasserversorgung|&quot;Bodensee-Wasserversorgung&quot;]], German language Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Car [[ferry|ferries]] link [[Romanshorn]], Switzerland to [[Friedrichshafen]], and [[Konstanz]] to [[Meersburg]].
==Name==
After the [[Council of Constance]], the Catholic world gave the lake its current name, after the city Constantia (Konstanz), that, in turn, was named after a Roman emperor (either [[Constantius Chlorus]] or his grandson [[Constantius II]]). The German name, Bodensee, derives on the other hand from the place name Bodman (today's [[Bodman-Ludwigshafen]]) just north of Konstanz.

==International borders==
There is no legally binding agreement as to where the boundaries lie between Switzerland, Germany and Austria where these three countries meet in Lake Constance. While Switzerland holds the view that the border runs through the middle of the lake, Austria is of the opinion that the lake stands in [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of all the states on its banks. Germany holds no unambiguous opinion. Legal questions pertaining to ship transport and fishing are regulated in separate treaties.

Naturally, disputes arise. One concerns a [[houseboat]] which was moored in two states ([[European Court of Justice|ECJ]] c. 224/97 Erich Ciola); another concerns the rights to fish in the Bay of Bregenz. In relation to the latter, an Austrian family was of the opinion that it alone had the right to fish in broad portions of the bay. However, this was accepted neither by the Austrian courts nor by the organs and courts of the other states.&lt;ref&gt;David Mark and Barry Smith, et al., [http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//baarle/bizarre_shapes.htm Bizarre Shapes: 100 Geographic Monsters].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent floods==
* A [[100-year flood]] around June 1999 ([[Pfingsthochwasser 1999]]) raised the level about 2 metres above normal, flooding harbors and many shoreline buildings and hotels.
* In late August 2005, heavy rains raised the level by more than 70&amp;nbsp;cm in a few days.  The rains caused widespread flooding and washed out highways and railroads.

== Islands in the lake==
The three major islands are:
*[[Mainau Island]]
*[[Reichenau Island]]
*[[Lindau, Lake Constance|Lindau]]

This is a complete list of the islands in Lake Constance, listed from east to west:

The '''''Technische Universität Dresden''''' (usually translated&lt;ref&gt;There is no official translation of the university's name. While ''university of technology'' is commonly used in English language, ''technical university'' is the most correct one emphasising the difference between technique and [[technology]] in German language.&lt;/ref&gt; from German as '''Dresden University of Technology''' and abbreviated '''TU Dresden''' or '''TUD''') is the largest institute of higher education in the city of [[Dresden]], the largest university in [[Saxony]] and one of the 10 largest universities in Germany with 36,066 students {{As of|2010|alt=as of 2010}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/portrait/zahlen_und_fakten Facts and figures of TUD]&lt;/ref&gt; The name Technische Universität Dresden has only been used since 1961; the history of the university, however, goes back nearly 200 years to 1828. This makes it one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany, and one of the country’s oldest universities, which in German today refers to institutes of higher education which cover the entire curriculum. The university is member of [[TU9]], a consortium of the nine leading German Institutes of Technology. The university is one of eleven universities which succeeded in all three rounds of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]] in 2012.

==History==
In 1828, with emerging [[industrialization]], the &quot;Saxon Technical School&quot; was founded to educate skilled workers in technological subjects such as [[mechanics]], [[mechanical engineering]] and ship construction. In 1871, the year the [[German Empire]] was founded, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic Institute]] (''Königlich-Sächsisches Polytechnikum''). At that time, subjects not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced. By the end of the 19th century the institute had developed into a university covering all disciplines. In 1961 it was given its present name, the Dresden University of Technology (''Technische Universität Dresden'').

[[Image:TH-Dresden-1905-Meyers.jpg|thumb|left|250px|TH Dresden 1905]]

Upon [[German reunification]] in 1990, the university had already integrated the College of Forestry (Forstliche Hochschule), formerly the [[Royal Saxony Academy of Forestry]], in the nearby small town of [[Tharandt]]. This was followed by the integration of the Dresden College of Engineering (Ingenieurshochschule Dresden), the [[Friedrich List]] College of Transport (Hochschule für Verkehrswesen) the faculty of transport science, and the “Carl-Gustav Carus” Medical Academy (Medizinische Akademie or MedAk for short), the medical faculty. Some faculties were newly founded: the faculties of [[Information Technology]] (1991), [[Law]] (1991), [[Education]] (1993) and [[Economics]] (1993).

==Research==
With regard to its ability to generate research money from industry partners, the TU Dresden belongs to the most successful in Germany. In 2004 3,564 projects were financed with 104.1 million Euro from outside sources (other than state funds). The TU Dresden benefits from the strong research tradition in microelectronics and transport sciences in the Dresden area, but also from the establishment of new research fields such as Biotechnology.

The ''[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]'' supports the university in many areas and TU Dresden cooperates closely with renowned research institutes such as [[Fraunhofer Society]], ''[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]]'' and [[Max Planck Society]].

===Biotechnology and Medical Technology===
The university has established a strong partnership with the ''[[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics]]'' in molecular bioengineering. As part of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]], the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] has decided to fund a Cluster of Excellence &quot;From Cells to Tissues to Therapies: Engineering the Cellular Basis of Regeneration&quot; ([[DFG-Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden]]), the  as well as a new graduate school, the &quot;[[Dresden International Graduate School for Biomedicine and Bioengineering]]&quot; with about 300 PhD students.

===Magnetism and Material Sciences===
The ''[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]'' funds research in the area of electromagnetic flow influence in metallurgy, artificial crystal formation and electrochemistry. Other research is done on the [[Meissner effect]] and artificial fibers (textile).

===Micro and Nanotechnology===
''[[Silicon Saxony]]'' is the biggest cluster of the microelectronics industries in Europe. TU Dresden is incorporated in this network with three departments of the Faculties of Electrical Engineering and Sciences. Together with the ''Fraunhofer Center for Nano-electronic technologies'' (CNT) it represents one of the leading universities in the field of nanotechnology. There is also a research cooperation with some semiconductor fields of [[TU Freiberg]]. In May 2012 the Helmholtz-Kolleg NANONET was founded.

===Other research areas===
The university has a partnership with the ''Fraunhofer-Institut for Transport and Infrastructure systems'' to research on IT-systems for public transport in Dresden.

In partnership with TU Dresden, the ''Ifo Institute of Economic Research (Ifo Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung e.V.)'' is researching the economic development in Eastern Germany.

The university belongs to a consortium of European Universities offering the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctoral Programme IT4BI-DC for Business Intelligence.

==Reputation==
[[Image:HSZ TUDresden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The main auditorium]]
The university offers a comprehensive spectrum of courses and research. It has a high reputation in technical fields such as [[electrical engineering]], [[computer science]], photo optics, engine construction and traffic logistics.

The university is considered highly underfunded. Until 2020 more than 1,000 jobs are to be cut at Saxon universities, including Dresden University of Technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeit-2011-44&quot;&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2011/44/S-Hochschulen ''Schnitt nach vorn'']. In: [[Die Zeit]], Nr. 44, 27. Oktober 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 there is an annual funding gap of about 50 million Euros.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeit-2012-02-02&quot;&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2012/06/S-Am-Start ''Halb gedroht'']. In: [[Die Zeit]], 2. Februar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2012, every single new or extended employment contract needs to be personally approved by the Minister-President of Saxony.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnn-2012-03-09&quot;&gt;[http://www.dnn-online.de/dresden/web/regional/kultur/detail/-/specific/Staatsregierung-schraenkt-Personalpolitik-an-Sachsens-Hochschulen-ein-Gruene-sprechen-von-Skandal-2808839705 ''Staatsregierung schränkt Personalpolitik an Sachsens Hochschulen ein – Grüne sprechen von „Skandal&quot;'']. In: [[Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten]] (online edition), 9. März 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister-President of Saxony promised to end this situation in case the university achieves what media often call an elite status in the German excellence initiative. The university officially achieved the status on June 15, 2012.

The Center of Biotechnology (&quot;[[BIOTEC]]&quot;) is a unique interdisciplinary center focusing on research and teaching in molecular [[bioengineering]]. The BIOTEC hosts top international research groups dedicated to [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[biophysics]], [[cellular machine]]s, [[tissue engineering]], and [[bioinformatics]].

The university is currently developing new strategies to make itself more independent from state funding and decision making. As one of the first universities in Germany it has opened a branch in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]] offering a Master's course in [[mechatronics]]. It also maintains close partnerships with leading universities around the world, e.g. [[Boston University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Tongji University]] and [[Pohang University of Science and Technology|POSTECH]].

In 2009 [[TU Dresden]], all Dresden institutes of the [[Fraunhofer Society]], the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]] and the [[Max Planck Society]] and [[Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf]], soon incorporated into the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]], published a joint letter of intent with the name DRESDEN-Konzept - Dresden Research and Education Synergies for the Development of Excellence and Novelty, which points out worldwide elite aspirations, which was recognized as the first time that all four big post-gradual elite institutions declared campus co-operation with a university. These German semi-public institutes hire their team leaders globally and settle freely within Germany and the city of Dresden has appealed to an unmatched absolute number of them. Building on that circle the university and non-university institutions formed Dresden Concept to strengthen international awareness and the position in applications for the German excellence initiative. A significant decision about success or failure of this strategy concept was expected for June 15, 2012. The characteristic focus on the technical and nature-science subjects of almost all quality-endeavours displeased especially students from other subjects who have to suffer most from reorganization, cancellation and shortage of qualified staffmembers.

==Campus==
[[Image:Slub-dresden-reading-room-2.JPG|thumb|right|200px| [[Saxon State Library|SLUB]] — Saxon State Library - Regional and University Library Dresden]]
TU Dresden is a campus university in most aspects. Some of its buildings are more than a hundred years old (such as the buildings around Muenchner Platz square). The architecture of these buildings is mostly influenced by the art nouveau style or the Bauhaus school (e.g. the Chemistry building ''Fritz-Foerster-Bau''). In recent years these historic building have been complemented by modern buildings (e.g. the library, the main auditorium, the biochemistry department or the life sciences building).

The main campus, as well as the medical faculty and that of Computer Science, are all within the boundaries of the city of Dresden. The main campus is located South of the city center, mostly in the area bordered by Nöthnitzer Straße, Fritz-Förster-Platz and Münchner Platz; the medical faculty can be found in the Johannstadt district. The faculty of forestry, formerly the [[Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry]], resides in a forest area in the nearby town of [[Tharandt]].

==Students==
===General===
Of the roughly 35,000 students, 45% are studying Engineering Sciences, 36.2% Humanities and Social Sciences, 12.5% Natural Sciences and Mathematics and 6.3% Medicine.

About 59% (20,620) of the student body originates from [[Saxony]], 18.9% (6,626) from other Eastern German federal states, 12.3% (4,306) from the Western German federal states and 9.8% (3,442) from other countries.

Of the 20,620 students from Saxony, 12,351 (59.9%) are from [[Dresden]], 2,934 (14,2%) from the Dresden metro area and 5,335 (25.9%) from other parts of Saxony.

The origin of the students is based on the location where the A-level exams have been completed.

===Foreign students===
There are 3,442 international students enrolled at the TU Dresden (2005/2006). Most of the foreign students come from Europe (1,527), followed by Asia (1,404) and [[Americas|America]] (170). Ranked by countries the largest group of students comes from China (710), followed by Poland (294), [[Vietnam]] (196), [[Bulgaria]] (160) and Russia (154). The university is also quite popular among Central and East European countries such as the neighboring Czech Republic or [[Ukraine]]. Also, through the [[Erasmus programme]] and partnerships with universities in the USA, there are many English, French and Spanish speaking students. The language spoken during lessons is nearly always German on most faculties. To prepare for admissions to the university, many foreign students attend German language courses at the University affiliated language school ''TUDIAS-Sprachschule''.

International students interested in TU Dresden should visit the websites of the &quot;[http://tu-dresden.de/internationales/akademisches_auslandsamt Akademisches Auslandsamt]&quot; (International office) for more information. This office is responsible for handling international applications. In the end of 2011 13.7% of beginning students came from abroad.

A number of activities for international students facilitates their integration and help students to find new friends. Most notably the ''Erasmus-Initiative TU Dresden'' offers many group activities throughout the semester which are open to all students (not only to Erasmus participants). A student run program, the ''LinkPartnerProgramm'' matches every interested international student with a German student, to help him or her with questions arising during the first weeks, be it regarding course registration or any other issue students might have.

The '''Dresden Frauenkirche''' ({{lang-de|Dresdner Frauenkirche}}, {{IPA-de|ˈfʁaʊənˌkɪʁçə|IPA}}, ''Church of Our Lady'') is a [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Lutheran]] church in [[Dresden]], the capital of the German state of [[Saxony]]. It is considered an outstanding  example of [[Protestant]] [[sacred architecture]], featuring one of the largest [[dome]]s in Europe.

Built in the 18th century, the church was destroyed in the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] during [[World War II]]. The remaining ruins were left as an anti-war memorial, following decisions of local [[East Germany|East German]] leaders. The church was rebuilt after the reunification of Germany. The reconstruction of its exterior was completed in 2004 and its interior in 2005. The church was reconsecrated on 30 October 2005 with festive services lasting through the Protestant observance of [[Reformation Day]] on 31 October. It nowadays also serves as symbol of reconciliation between former warring enemies. 

Once a month, an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] is held in English, by clergy from the [[St. George's Anglican Church, Berlin|St. George's Anglican Chaplaincy]].

==History==
[[Image:Dresden 1521.jpg|thumb|Dresden in 1521: The antecessor building was outside the city walls (pictured in the right upper corner, left of the coat of arms)]]
[[Image:Canaletto (I) 006.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Dresden Market with the Frauenkirche (1749-1751 painting by [[Bernardo Bellotto]]).]]

A first ''[[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Kirche zu unser liuben Vrouwen]]'' was built in the 11th century in [[Romanesque art|romanesque architecture]]. It was outside the city walls and surrounded by a grave yard. The Frauenkirche was seat of an [[archpriest]] in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen|Diocese Meißen]] until Reformation, when it became a Protestant church. This first Frauenkirche was torn down in 1727 and replaced by a new church due to capacity requests. The modern Frauenkirche was built as a Lutheran ([[Protestant]]) [[parish church]] by the citizenry. Even though [[Saxony]]'s [[Prince-elector]], [[August II the Strong|Frederick August I]], reconverted to [[Roman Catholicism]] to become King of Poland, he supported the construction to have an impressive cupola in the Dresden townscape.

The original [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] church was built between 1726 and 1743, and was designed by Dresden's city architect, [[George Bähr]], who did not live to see the completion of his greatest work. Bähr's distinctive design for the church captured the new spirit of the Protestant [[liturgy]] by placing the [[altar]], [[pulpit]], and [[baptismal font]] directly centred in view of the entire [[wikt:congregation|congregation]].

In 1736, famed organ maker [[Gottfried Silbermann]] built a three-manual, 43-stop instrument for the church. The organ was dedicated on 25 November and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] gave a recital on the instrument on 1 December.

[[Image:Dresden Frauenkirche 1880.jpg|thumb|220px|Dresden. Frauenkirche, between 1860 and 1890]]
The church's most distinctive feature was its unconventional 96&amp;nbsp;m-high dome, called ''die Steinerne Glocke'' or &quot;Stone Bell&quot;. An engineering feat comparable to [[Michelangelo]]'s dome for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]], the Frauenkirche's 12,000-ton [[sandstone]] dome stood high resting on eight slender supports. Despite initial doubts, the dome proved to be extremely stable. Witnesses in 1760 said that the dome had been hit by more than 100 cannonballs fired by the [[Prussia]]n army led by [[Frederick II of Prussia|Friedrich II]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The projectiles bounced off and the church survived.

The completed church gave the city of Dresden a distinctive silhouette, captured in famous paintings by [[Bernardo Bellotto]], a nephew of the artist [[Canaletto]] (also known by the same name), and in ''Dresden by Moonlight'' by Norwegian painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]].

In 1849, the church was at the heart of the revolutionary disturbances known as the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May Uprising]]. It was surrounded by barricades, and fighting lasted for days before those rebels who had not already fled were rounded up in the church and arrested.

For more than 200 years, the bell-shaped dome stood over the skyline of old Dresden, dominating the city.

Burials include [[Heinrich Schütz]] and [[George Bähr]].

==Destruction==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-60015-0002, Dresden, Denkmal Martin Luther, Frauenkirche, Ruine.jpg|thumb|220px|Ruins of the Frauenkirche, 1958]]
[[Image:FrauenkircheCataloguedFragments gobeirne.jpg||thumb|220px|right|Secured structural fragments stored catalogued, September 1999]]
On 13 February 1945, Anglo-American allied forces began the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]]. The church withstood two days and nights of the attacks and the eight interior sandstone pillars supporting the large dome held up long enough for the evacuation of 300 people who had sought shelter in the church crypt, before succumbing to the heat generated by some 650,000 [[incendiary bomb]]s that were dropped on the city. The temperature surrounding and inside the church eventually reached 1,000 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name=&quot;tempprince&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/641423.stm BBC News | UK | Duke leads Dresden tribute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The dome finally collapsed at 10 a.m. on 15 February. The pillars glowed bright red and exploded; the outer walls shattered and nearly 6,000 tons of stone plunged to earth, penetrating the massive floor as it fell.

The [[altar]], a [[relief]] depiction of [[Jesus]]’ agony in the Garden of Gethsemane on the [[Mount of Olives]] by [[Johann Christian Feige]], was only partially damaged during the bombing raid and fire that destroyed the church. The altar and the structure behind it, the [[chancel]], were among the remnants left standing. Features of most of the figures were lopped off by falling debris and the fragments lay under the rubble.

The building vanished from Dresden's skyline, and the blackened stones would lie in wait in a pile in the centre of the city for the next 45 years as [[Communism|Communist]] rule enveloped what was now [[East Germany]]. Shortly after the end of World War II, residents of Dresden had already begun salvaging unique stone fragments from the Church of Our Lady and numbering them for future use in reconstruction. Popular sentiment discouraged the authorities from clearing the ruins away to make a car park. In 1966, the remnants were officially declared a &quot;memorial against war&quot;, and state-controlled commemorations were held there on the anniversaries of the destruction of Dresden.

In 1982, the ruins began to be the site of a [[peace movement]] combined with peaceful protests against the East German regime. On the anniversary of the bombing, 400 citizens of Dresden came to the ruins in silence with flowers and candles, part of a growing East German civil rights movement. By 1989, the number of protesters in Dresden, [[Leipzig]] and other parts of East Germany had increased to tens of thousands, and the [[Inner German border|wall]] dividing East and West Germany toppled. This opened the way to the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]].

==Promoting reconstruction and funding==
There had already been intentions to rebuild the church during the last months of World War II. However, due to political circumstances in the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]], the reconstruction later came to a halt. The heap of ruins was conserved as a war memorial within the inner city of Dresden, as a direct counterpart to the ruins of [[Coventry Cathedral]], which was destroyed by German bombing in 1940 and also serves as a war memorial in the [[United Kingdom]]. Because of the continuing decay of the ruins, Dresden decided in 1985 (after the [[Semperoper]] was finally finished) to rebuild the Church of Our Lady after the completion of the reconstruction of the [[Dresden castle]].

After the [[reunification of Germany]], efforts were revived. In 1989, a 14-member group of enthusiasts headed by [[Ludwig Güttler]], a noted Dresden musician, formed a Citizens' Initiative. From that group emerged a year later &quot;The Society to Promote the Reconstruction of the Church of Our Lady&quot;, which began an aggressive private fund-raising campaign. The organisation grew to over 5,000 members in Germany and 20 other countries. A string of German auxiliary groups were formed, and three promotional organisations were created abroad.

The project gathered momentum. As hundreds of architects, art historians and engineers sorted the thousands of stones, identifying and labeling each for reuse in the new structure, others worked to raise money.

[[Günter Blobel]], a German-born American, saw the original Church of Our Lady as a boy when his refugee family took shelter in a town just outside of Dresden days before the city was bombed. In 1994, he became the founder and president of the nonprofit &quot;[[Friends of Dresden, Inc.]]&quot;, a United States organization dedicated to supporting the reconstruction, restoration and preservation of Dresden's artistic and architectural legacy. In 1999, Blobel won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for medicine]] and donated the entire amount of his award money (nearly US$1 million) to the organization for the restoration of Dresden, to the rebuilding of the Frauenkirche and the building of a new [[synagogue]]. It was the single largest individual donation to the project.

In Britain, the [[Dresden Trust]] has the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]] as its royal patron and the [[Bishop of Coventry]] among its curators. Dr. [[Paul Oestreicher]], a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] emeritus of [[Coventry Cathedral]] and a founder of the Dresden Trust, wrote [http://www.guardian.co.uk/germany/article/0,,1605134,00.html] &quot;The church is to Dresden what [[St. Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's [Cathedral]]] is to London&quot;. Additional organizations include France's ''Association Frauenkirche Paris'', Switzerland's ''Verein Schweizer Freunde der Frauenkirch'', among others.

Rebuilding the church cost €180 million. Dresdner Bank financed more than half of the reconstruction costs via a &quot;donor certificates campaign&quot;, collecting almost €70 million after 1995. The bank itself contributed more than seven million Euros, including more than one million donated by its employees. Over the years, thousands of [[watch]]es containing tiny fragments of Church of Our Lady stone were sold, as were specially printed medals. One sponsor raised nearly €2.3 million through symbolic sales of individual church stones.

Funds raised were turned over to the &quot;Frauenkirche Foundation Dresden&quot;, with the reconstruction being backed by the State of [[Saxony]], the City of Dresden and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Saxony]].

==Reconstruction==
[[Image:FraunkircheSouth.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The north side in 2006, observing the largest remaining original structure interoperated with the restored work]]
[[Image:Frauenkirche 2003.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Work on the cupola in 2003]]

Using original plans used by builder Georg Bähr in the 1720s, reconstruction finally began in January 1993 under the direction of church architect and engineer [[Eberhard Burger]]. The foundation stone was laid in 1994, the [[crypt]] was completed in 1996 and the inner [[cupola]] in 2000.

As far as possible, the church – except for its dome – was rebuilt using original material and plans, with the help of modern technology. The heap of rubble was documented and carried off stone by stone. The approximate original position of each stone could be determined from its position in the heap. Every usable piece was measured and catalogued. A computer imaging program that could move the stones three-dimensionally around the screen in various configurations was used to help architects find where the original stones sat and how they fit together.

Of the millions of stones used in the rebuilding, more than 8,500 original stones were salvaged from the original church and approximately 3,800 reused in the reconstruction. As the older stones are covered with a darker [[patina]], due to fire damage and weathering, the difference between old and new stones will be clearly visible for a number of years after reconstruction.

Two thousand pieces of the original altar were cleaned and incorporated into the new structure.

The builders relied on thousands of old photographs, memories of worshippers and church officials and crumbling old purchase orders detailing the quality of the mortar or pigments of the paint (as in the 18th century, copious quantities of eggs were used to make the color that provides the interior with its almost luminescent glow).

When it came time to duplicate the oak doors of the entrance, the builders had only vague descriptions of the detailed carving. Because people (especially wedding parties) often posed for photos outside the church doors, they issued an appeal for old photographs and the response—which included entire wedding albums—allowed artisans to recreate the original doors.

The new gilded orb and [[Christian cross|cross]] on top of the dome was forged by Grant Macdonald Silversmiths in [[London]] using the original 18th-century techniques as much as possible. It was constructed by Alan Smith, a British goldsmith from London whose father, Frank, was a member of one of the aircrews who took part in the bombing of Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/225369.stm BBC News | UK | Dresden Cross presented at Windsor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Before travelling to Dresden, the cross was exhibited for five years in churches across the United Kingdom including [[Coventry Cathedral]], [[Liverpool Cathedral]], [[St Giles Cathedral]] in [[Edinburgh]] and [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London. In February 2000, the cross was ceremonially handed over by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|The Duke of Kent]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tempprince&quot;/&gt; to be placed on the top of the dome a few days after the 60th commemoration of [[D-Day]] on 22 June 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3830135.stm BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Dresden ruins finally restored&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The external structure of the Frauenkirche was completed. For the first time since the last war, the completed dome and its gilded cross grace Dresden's skyline as in centuries prior. The cross that once topped the dome, now twisted and charred, stands to the right of the new altar.

Seven new bells were cast for the church. They rang for the first time for the [[Pentecost]] celebration in 2003.

[[Image:Dresden, bruehlsche Terrasse 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Close to completion the building structure dominates the historic skyline again]]
[[Image:Frauenkirche interior 2008 001-Frauenkirche interior 2008 009.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Interior with view of altar]]

It was decided not to reproduce a [[replica]] of the Silbermann organ, despite the fact that the original design papers, description and details exist. The decision resulted in the Dresden organ dispute (&quot;[[Dresdner Orgelstreit]]&quot;). A 4,873 pipe organ was built by [[Daniel Kern Manufacture d'Orgues|Daniel Kern]] of [[Strasbourg]], [[Alsace]], and completed in April 2005. The Kern organ contains all the stops which were on the stoplist of the Silbermann organ and tries to reconstruct them. Additional stops also are included, especially a fourth swell manual in the symphonic 19th century style which is apt for the organ literature composed after the baroque period.

A bronze statue of reformer and theologian [[Martin Luther]], which survived the bombings, has been restored and again stands in front of the church. It is the work of sculptor [[Adolf von Donndorf]] from 1885.

The intensive efforts to rebuild this world famous landmark were completed in 2005, one year earlier than originally planned, and in time for the 800-year anniversary of the city of Dresden in 2006. The church was reconsecrated with a festive service one day before [[Reformation Day]]. The rebuilt church is a monument reminding people of its history and a symbol of hope and reconciliation.

There are two devotional services every day and two liturgies every Sunday. Since October 2005, there has been an exhibition on the history and reconstruction of the Frauenkirche at the Stadtmuseum (City Museum) in Dresden's Alten Landhaus.

==Since the re-opening==
Since re-opening, the Church of Our Lady has been a hugely popular tourist destination in Dresden. In the first three years after the re-opening, seven million people have visited the church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deafvision.de/nachrichten/politik/7-mio-besucher-dresdner-frauenkirche&lt;/ref&gt; The project has inspired other revitalization projects throughout Europe. Christian services are again available. In 2009 the church was visited by US President [[Barack Obama]] after a meeting with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] in the [[Grünes Gewölbe]].

==Criticisms of reconstruction methods==
One historian&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]: &quot;Disguised Visibilities: Dresden/&quot;Dresden.&quot; ''Memory and Architecture'', Ed. By Eleni Bastea, (University of Mexico Press, 2004), p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; complained that unidentifiable parts of the ruins were placed in arbitrary locations in the new building. As a result, he claimed that the &quot;Socialist monument [to the bombing] was ... dispersed throughout the fabric of the building&quot;.

The '''White House''' is the [[official residence]] and principal workplace of the [[President of the United States]], located at 1600 [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]]. It has been the residence of every U.S. president since [[John Adams]] in 1800.

The house was designed by Irish-born [[James Hoban]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the White House|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/inside-white-house/history|work=The White House|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built between 1792 and 1800 of white-painted [[Aquia Creek sandstone]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]. When [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]]) expanded the building outward, creating two [[colonnade]]s that were meant to conceal stables and storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |author=Michael W. Fazio and Patrick A. Snadon |year=2006 |pages=364–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the mansion was set ablaze by the [[British Army]] in the [[Burning of Washington]], destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President [[James Monroe]] moved into the partially reconstructed [[Executive Residence]] in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the South Portico in 1824 and the North in 1829. 

Because of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed [[West Wing]] in 1901. Eight years later, President [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the West Wing and created the first [[Oval Office]] which was eventually moved as the section was expanded. The third-floor [[attic]] was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [[hip roof]] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed [[East Wing]] was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. 

East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under [[Harry S. Truman]], the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing [[steel frame]] constructed inside the walls. Once this work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.

Today, the [[White House Complex]] includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]—the former State Department, which now houses offices for the President's staff and the Vice President—and [[Blair House]], a guest residence.

The Executive Residence is made up of six stories—the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, as well as a two-story [[White House basement|basement]]. The term ''White House'' is regularly used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States]] and for the president's administration and advisers in general. The property is a [[National Heritage Site (United States)|National Heritage Site]] owned by the [[National Park Service]] and is part of the [[President's Park]]. In 2007, it was ranked second on the [[American Institute of Architects]] list of &quot;[[America's Favorite Architecture]]&quot;.

==History==

===1789–1800===
Following his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two executive mansions in New York City: the [[Samuel Osgood House (New York City)|Samuel Osgood House]] at 3 Cherry Street (April 1789&amp;nbsp;– February 1790), and the [[Alexander Macomb House]] at 39–41 Broadway (February–August 1790).

The July 1790 [[Residence Act]] named [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the temporary national capital for a 10-year period while the [[Washington, D.C.|Federal City]] was under construction. The City of Philadelphia rented [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]]'s [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|city house]] at 190 High Street (now 524-30 Market Street) for Washington's presidential residence. The first president occupied the Market Street mansion from November 1790 to March 1797, and altered it in ways that may have influenced the design of the White House. As part of a futile effort to have Philadelphia named the permanent national capital, Pennsylvania built a presidential palace several blocks away, but Washington declined to move there.

President John Adams also occupied the Market Street mansion from March 1797 to May 1800. In November 1800, he became the first president to occupy the White House. The [[President's House (Philadelphia)|President's House in Philadelphia]] became a hotel and was demolished in 1832 while the unused presidential palace became home to the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

The President's House was a major feature of [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's]]'s plan for the newly established federal city, Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20061230082500/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/05/subs/images_print/05_f.pdf|title=Timelines-Architecture|accessdate=2007-11-13|format=PDF|publisher=White House Historical Association|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'Enfant identified himself as &quot;Peter Charles L'Enfant&quot; during most of his life, while residing in the United States. He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 &quot;Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ....&quot;] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, &quot;Pierre Charles L'Enfant&quot;. (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. ISBN 978-0-9727611-0-9). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: &quot;(a) In General.—The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.&quot; The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as &quot;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]&quot; and as &quot;[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]&quot; on its website.&lt;/ref&gt; The architect of the White House was chosen in a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] which received nine proposals, including one submitted anonymously by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frary, Ihna Thayer |title=They Built the Capitol |year=1969 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=27 |isbn=0-8369-5089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Washington visited [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in May 1791 on his &quot;Southern Tour&quot;, and saw the under-construction [[Charleston County Courthouse]] designed by Irish architect [[James Hoban]]. He is reputed to have met with Hoban then, and summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him there in June 1792.&lt;ref&gt;William Seale, &quot;James Hoban: Builder of the White House&quot; in ''White House History'' no. 22 (Spring 2008), pp. 8–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 1792, the President met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban's submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/04/subs/04_b_1792.html|title=Primary Document Activities |accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher= White House Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington was not entirely pleased with the original submission, however; he found it too small, lacking ornament, and not monumental enough to house the nation's president. On his recommendation, the house was changed from three stories to two, and was widened from a nine-bay facade to an 11-bay facade. Hoban's competition drawings do not survive.

===Design influences===

The building Hoban designed is verifiably influenced by the upper floors of [[Leinster House]], in [[Dublin]], Republic of Ireland, which later became the seat of the [[Oireachtas]] (the Irish parliament).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc31.htm|title=The White House|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, details like the bow-fronted south front, and interior details like the former niches in the present [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. These influences, though undocumented, are cited in the official White House guide, and in White House Historical Association publications. The first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban's design for the South Portico and [[Château de Rastignac]], a neoclassical country house located in La Bachellerie in the Dordogne region of France and designed by Mathurin Salat.  Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the French Revolution for twenty years and then finally built 1812–1817 (based on Salat's pre-1789 design).&lt;ref name=&quot;France?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecolumnists.com/johnson/johnson103.html|title= Our White House in France?|author=Michael Johnson|work=TheColumnists.Com|date=May 10, 2006|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of a connection posit that [[Thomas Jefferson]], during his tour of Bordeaux in 1789, viewed Salat's architectural drawings (which were on-file at the College) at the ''École Spéciale d'Architecture'' (Bordeaux Architectural College).&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=A chateau fit for a president|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/opinion/15iht-edjohnson.html|author=Johnson, Michael |date=September 15, 2006 |journal=New York Times|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On his return to the U.S. he then  shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].&lt;ref name =&quot;France?&quot;/&gt;

===Construction===

Construction of the White House began with the laying of the cornerstone on October 13, 1792, although there was no formal ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Old Georgetown |year=1933 |publisher=Garrett &amp; Massie, Inc. |author=Ecker, Grace Dunlop |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main residence, as well as foundations of the house, were built largely by [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] and free African-American laborers, as well as employed Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_african-americans-01.html|title=Time line&amp;nbsp;– African-Americans|accessdate=2007-11-13 |publisher= White House Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the other work on the house was performed by immigrants, many not yet with citizenship. The sandstone walls were erected by [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrants, employed by Hoban,&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20071116134013/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/02/subs/02_b.html|title=White House Tour Essays: The Overview|accessdate=2007-11-07|publisher=White House Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were the high-relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the &quot;fish scale&quot; pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. The initial construction took place over a period of eight years, at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|232371.83|1800}}}} today). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy on or circa November 1, 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/overview.htm|title=Overview of the White House|accessdate=2007-11-09 |publisher= White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortages, including material and labor, forced alterations to the earlier plan developed by French engineer [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] for a &quot;palace&quot; that was five times larger than the house that was eventually built.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt; The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone façades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were [[whitewash]]ed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt;

As it is a famed structure in America, several [[replicas of the White House]] have been constructed.

===Architectural description===

The principal facade of the White House, the north front, is of three floors and eleven bays. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and [[parapet]], thus the facade appears to be of two floors. The central three bays are behind a [[Prostyle|prostyle portico]] (this was a later addition to the house, built circa 1830) serving, thanks to the carriage ramp, as a [[porte cochere]]. The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented [[pediment]]s, while at second-floor level the pediments are flat. The principal entrance at the centre of the portico is surmounted by [[lunette]] [[fanlight]]. Above the entrance is a [[sculpture|sculpted]] swag in relief. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded [[parapet]].

The mansion's southern facade is a combination of the [[Palladian]] and neoclassical styles of architecture. It is of three floors, all visible. The ground floor is [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] in the Palladian fashion. At the centre of the facade is a neoclassical projecting bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by 5 bays, the windows of which, as on the north facade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground floor [[double staircase]] leading to an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[colonnade]]d [[loggia]] (with the [[Truman Balcony]] at second-floor level), known as the south portico. The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the facade.

===Naming conventions===

The building was originally referred to variously as the &quot;President's Palace&quot;, &quot;Presidential Mansion&quot;, or &quot;President's House&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Seale, William |title=The President's House, A History.

Although it was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, it is also speculated that the name of the traditional residence of the President of the United States may have derived from [[Martha Washington]]'s home, [[White House (plantation)|White House Plantation]] in Virginia, where the nation's first President had courted the First Lady in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.co.new-kent.va.us/planningcomm/ExistingConditions.pdf|title=New Kent County Comprehensive Plan|accessdate= 2007-11-07|author= K.W.

==Evolution of the White House==

===Early use, the 1814 fire, and rebuilding===

On Saturday, November 1, 1800, [[John Adams]] became the first president to take residence in the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt; During Adams' second day in the house, he wrote a letter to his wife Abigail, containing a prayer for the house. Adams wrote:
{{quote|I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha state dining room&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20071203002312/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/02/subs/02_b09.html|title=The State Dining Room |accessdate= 2007-11-02|publisher= White House Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Theodore Roosevelt had Adams's blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha state dining room&quot;/&gt;

Adams lived in the house only briefly before [[Thomas Jefferson]] moved into the &quot;pleasant country residence&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jefferson Describes the White House|url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?170179|work=Original Manuscripts and Primary Sources|publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (&quot;big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Whitcomb, ''Real Life at the White House: 200 Years of Daily Life at America's Most Famous Residence''. Routledge, 2000. ISBN 978-0-415-92320-0. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt; Today, Jefferson's colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt;

In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], the White House was set ablaze by British troops&lt;ref name=&quot;whha east room&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20071007081129/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/02/subs/02_b03.html|title=The East Room |accessdate= 2007-11-02|publisher= White House Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Burning of Washington]], in retaliation for burning [[Upper Canada]]'s [[Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada|Parliament Buildings]] in the [[Battle of York]]; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was ransacked by British troops, only two have been recovered. Employees and slaves rescued a painting of George Washington,&lt;ref name=&quot;whha east room&quot;/&gt; and in 1939, a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington. Some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of British ships led by [[HMS Fantome (1810)|HMS ''Fantome'']] sank en route to [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]] off [[Prospect, Nova Scotia|Prospect]] during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=1e2fb507-5704-45d5-a997-f4015c772e7c|title=Treasure hunt or modern-day pirates?|publisher=canada.com|year=2006|accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/british-warship-sunk-during-war-with-us-may-hold-lost-treasures-of-white-house-517123.html |title=British warship sunk during war with US may hold lost treasures of White House |first=David |last= Usborne |date= November 27, 2005|work=The Independent |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though ''Fantome'' had no involvement in that action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young | first= G.F.W | title= HMS ''Fantome'' and the British Raid on Washington August 1814| journal= Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society Journal| volume=10 |pages= 132–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fire, President [[James Madison]] resided in [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|The Octagon House]] from 1814 to 1815, and then the [[Seven Buildings]] from 1815 to the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Irvin. ''Historic Homes of the American Presidents.'' New York: Dover Publishing, 1991, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, both architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe and Hoban contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south [[portico]] was constructed in 1824 during the [[James Monroe]] administration; the north portico was built six years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt; Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Domestic Architecture of Benjamin Henry Latrobe |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |author=Michael W. Fazio and Patrick A. Snadon |year=2006 |pages=368–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; An elliptical portico at [[Château de Rastignac]] in La Bachellerie, France with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico,&lt;ref name=&quot;wh museum 1825-1872&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/special/renovation-1825.htm|title=Architectural Improvements: 1825–1872|accessdate= 2007-11-02|publisher=The White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this matter is one of great debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/09/15/opinion/edjohnson.php|title=A chateau fit for a president|accessdate= 2007-11-02|work=International Herald Tribune|date= 15|year= 2006|month= September|last=Johnson|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the [[Áras an Uachtaráin|Viceregal Lodge]] (now ''Áras an Uachtaráin'', residence of the [[President of Ireland]]), for its portico postdates the White House porticos' design.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh museum 1825-1872&quot;/&gt; For the North Portico, a variation on the Ionic Order was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.

===Overcrowding and building the West Wing===
[[File:White House entrance-hall Tiffany screen 1882 crop.jpg|thumb|Entrance Hall in 1882, showing the new Tiffany glass screen]]

By the time of the [[American Civil War]], the White House had become overcrowded. The location of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for [[malaria]] and other unhealthy conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;epstein&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The East and West Wings of the White House |author=Epstein, Ellen Robinson |date=1971–1972 |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at [[Meridian Hill Park|Meridian Hill]] in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;epstein&quot;/&gt;

[[File:1860s White House.jpg|thumb|right|The White House [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] in the 1860s, during the [[Abraham Lincoln]] administration]]
The [[Panic of 1873]] had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The [[Statue of Liberty]] project was not the only undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the [[Washington Monument]] sometimes stalled for years.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Yasmin Sabina (2010). Enlightening the World: The Creation of the Statue of Liberty, p.159–160, Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press. ISBN 978-0-8014-4851-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Chester Arthur]] took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed [[Lucretia Garfield]] moved out.

In the fall of 1882 work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of [[gold leaf]], and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, and colorful [[Tracery|traceries]] woven to spell &quot;USA&quot;. The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.&lt;ref name=&quot;reeves269&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Reeves | first = Thomas C. | title = Gentleman Boss | publisher = Alfred A.

In 1891, First Lady [[Caroline Harrison]] proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for an historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;epstein&quot;/&gt; A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham, which reflected the Harrison proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;epstein&quot;/&gt; These plans were ultimately rejected. However, in 1901 [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his family moved into the White House and hired [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] to carry out renovations and expansion, including the addition of a [[West Wing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt; ([[Charles Follen McKim|McKim]] designed and managed the project.) President [[William Howard Taft]] enlisted the help of architect Nathan C. Wyeth to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the [[Oval Office]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epstein&quot;/&gt;

The West Wing was damaged by fire in 1929, but rebuilt during the remaining years of the [[Herbert Hoover]] presidency. In the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whha overview&quot;/&gt;

President Truman had the original timber frame sawn into paneling; the walls of the [[Vermeil Room]], [[Library (White House)|Library]], [[China Room]], and [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/whtour/library.html|title=Library Art and Furnishings|accessdate= 2007-11-07|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kennedy restoration===
[[File:BoudinRedRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] as designed by [[Stéphane Boudin]] during the administration of John F. Kennedy]]

[[Jacqueline Kennedy]], wife of President [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961–63), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house. She enlisted the help of [[Henry Francis du Pont]] of the [[Winterthur Museum]] to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh museum kennedy&quot;/&gt; Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements of the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the [[Crowninshield family]], [[Jane Engelhard]], [[Jayne Wrightsman]], and the Oppenheimer family. [[Stéphane Boudin]] of the [[Maison Jansen|House of Jansen]], a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Mrs. Kennedy to assist with the decoration.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh museum kennedy&quot;/&gt; Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], French Empire for the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], American Empire for the [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], Louis XVI for the [[Yellow Oval Room]], and Victorian for the president's study, renamed the [[Treaty Room]]. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed. The Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh museum kennedy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/special/renovation-1961.htm|title=Kennedy Renovation: 1961–1963|accessdate=2007-11-07|publisher=White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy|Mrs. Kennedy]] installed an antique &quot;Vue de l'Amérique Nord&quot; wall paper which [[Zuber &amp; Cie]] had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.

The first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs.  Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/JFK+in+History/Jacqueline+Kennedy+in+the+White+House+Page+3.htm|page=3|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090303180252/http://jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/JFK+in+History/Jacqueline+Kennedy+in+the+White+House+Page+3.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2009|title=Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House|accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=John F.

==The White House since the Kennedy restoration==
[[File:President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson prior to ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|Pres. Kennedy and Vice Pres. Johnson]]
Out of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_architecture-04.html|title=Architecture: 1970s|accessdate=2008-12-07|publisher=White House Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family — usually represented by the First Lady, the [[White House Curator]], and the [[Chief Usher of the White House|Chief Usher]] — to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11145.html|title=Executive Order 11145—Providing for a Curator of the White House and establishing a Committee for the Preservation of the White House|accessdate=2007-11-08|publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nixon administration (1969–74), First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/presidents/article-9104648|title=Nixon, Pat|accessdate=2007-11-08|year=2007|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Nixon's efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=38|title=First Lady Biography: Pat Nixon|accessdate=2007-11-08|publisher=The National First Ladies Library|year=2005|quote=For the White House itself, and thus for the American people, Pat Nixon also decided to accelerate the collection process of fine antiques as well as historically associative pieces, adding some 600 paintings and antiques to the White House Collection.

In the 1990s, [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] refurbished some rooms with the assistance of [[Arkansas]] decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, [[State Dining Room]], Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room.&lt;ref name=&quot;wh makeover&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecalifornian.com/article/20081107/LIFESTYLE/811070315|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081206172237/http://www.thecalifornian.com/article/20081107/LIFESTYLE/811070315|archivedate=December 6, 2008|title=White House makeover|accessdate=2008-12-07|date=November 12, 2008|work=The Californian|author=Koncius, Jura}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the administration of [[George W.

The White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington when modifications were made during the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who used a wheelchair because of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|his paralytic illness]]. In the 1990s, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] — at the suggestion of Visitors Office Director Melinda N. Bates — approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor. It allowed easy [[wheelchair]] access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side. 

The president usually travels to and from the White House grounds via official [[motorcade]] or helicopter. In the 1950s, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was the first president to travel by helicopter to and from the White House grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_timelines/timelines_technology-04.html|title=Technology: 1950s|accessdate=2008-12-07|publisher=White House Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout and amenities===

Today the group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the [[White House Complex]]. It includes the central [[Executive Residence]] flanked by the [[East Wing]] and [[West Wing]].

===Executive Residence===
{{Main|Executive Residence}}

The original residence is in the center. Two [[colonnade]]s—one on the east and one on the west—designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings, added later. The [[Executive Residence]] houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the [[East Room]], [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]], [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]], [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]], [[State Dining Room]], [[Family Dining Room]], [[Cross Hall]], [[Entrance Hall]], and [[Grand Staircase (White House)|Grand Staircase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/Floor1.htm|title=White House Residence First Floor|accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ground Floor is made up of the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]], [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]], [[China Room]], [[Vermeil Room]], [[White House Library|Library]], the main kitchen, and other offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/Floor0.htm|title=White House Residence Ground Floor|accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second floor family residence includes the [[Yellow Oval Room]], [[East Sitting Hall|East]] and [[West Sitting Hall]]s, the White House Master Bedroom, [[President's Dining Room]], the [[Treaty Room]], [[Lincoln Bedroom]] and [[Queens' Bedroom]], as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/Floor2.htm|title=White House Residence Second Floor|accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=White House Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W.

===West Wing===
{{Main|West Wing}}

The West Wing houses the President's office (the [[Oval Office]]) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It also includes the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]], where the president conducts business meetings and where the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/history/life/cabinetroom.html|title=Debates and Decisions: Life in the Cabinet Room|accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[White House Situation Room]], [[James S.

This portion of the building was used as the setting for the popular television show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.

===East Wing===
{{Main|East Wing}}

The East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], and the White House Social Office. [[Rosalynn Carter]], in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the &quot;Office of the First Lady&quot;. The East Wing was built during [[World War II]] in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center]].

===Grounds===

The White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]], which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]] that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger green houses were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. Although the White House grounds have had many gardeners through their history, the general design, still largely used as master plan today, was designed in 1935 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] of the [[Olmsted Brothers]] firm, under commission from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the [[White House Rose Garden]] was redesigned by [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]]. The Rose garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]], which was begun by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old [[American Elm|American Elm (''Ulmus americana'' L.)]] tree on the north side of the building, came down during one of the many storms amid [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|intense flooding]]. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'') planted by Andrew Jackson. Michelle Obama planted the White Houses' first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2009/03/28/michelle-obama-goes-organic-and-brings-in-the-bees.html |title=Michelle Obama Goes Organic and Brings in the Bees – Washington Whispers |publisher=US News and World REport |date=March 28, 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access and security==
{{See also|White House Visitors Office|White House intruders}}

Like the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] followed him home, where he greeted them in the [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]]. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President [[Andrew Jackson]] had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected [[Grover Cleveland]] arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President [[Bill Clinton]] would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.

The White House remained accessible in other ways; President [[Abraham Lincoln]] complained{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} that he was constantly beleaguered by job seekers waiting to ask him for political appointments or other favors, or eccentric dispensers of advice like &quot;General&quot; [[Daniel Pratt (eccentric)|Daniel Pratt]], as he began the business day. Lincoln put up with the annoyance rather than risk alienating some associate or friend of a powerful politician or opinion maker. 

In 1974, a stolen Army helicopter landed without authorization on the White House grounds. Twenty years later, in 1994, a light plane crashed on the White House grounds, and the pilot died instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/americas/1159300.stm |work=BBC News | title=White House security scares | date=February 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated in 2005 before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Joe Johns|coauthors=Kelli Arena and Kathleen Koch|title=Intruding pilots released without charges|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/11/evacuation/index.html|publisher=CNN|date= May 12, 2005|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of April 19, 1995, the [[United States Secret Service]] closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the [[Treasury Building (Washington, D.C.)|Treasury Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Report of the White House Security Review|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/ustreas/usss/t1pubrpt.html|publisher=Order of the Secretary of the Treasury|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Pennsylvania Avenue closing, in particular, has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much further back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Statement of [[Committee of 100 on the Federal City]] and The National Coalition to Save Our Mall|url=http://www.savethemall.org/other/pa_ave.html|publisher=National Coalition to Save Our Mall, Inc|accessdate=2007-11-08|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the [[Old Executive Office Building]] to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remains closed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting the White House|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/tours/|publisher=The White House|accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House Complex is protected by the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].

[[NASAMS]] (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System) were used to guard air space over Washington, D.C. during the 2005 presidential inauguration. The same NASAMS units have since been used to protect the president and all air space around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grunder.no/magasinet/arkiv/okonomisk-rapport-2006/nr-02/rapport/norske-vapen-vokter-presidenten/ |title=Norske våpen vokter presidenten : Gründer Økonomisk Rapport |publisher=Grunder |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2006/03/13/460587.html |title=Norge sikret innsettelsen av Bush – Nyheter |publisher=Dagbladet |date=March 13, 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House tours have ended on March 9, 2013 until further notice, due to [[Sequester (2013)|sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House tours canceled due to federal budget cuts|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-white-house-tours-cancelled-budget-cuts-20130305,0,5471476.story|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Pennsylvania Ave in front of the residence was closed down to the public after the [[Boston Marathon Bombing]] and is still closed at of 4-17-13

'''Sri Pada''' (also '''Adam's peak'''; Sinhalese ''Samanalakanda'' - සමනළ කන්ද &quot;butterfly mountain&quot;, and also ශ්‍රී පාදය &quot;Sri Paadaya&quot;; Tamil ''Sivanolipatha Malai'' - சிவனொளி பாதமலை), is a {{convert|2243|m|ft|0}} tall conical [[mountain]] located in central [[Sri Lanka]].  It is well known for the '''Sri Pada''', i.e.,  &quot;sacred footprint&quot;, a  {{Convert|1.8|m}} rock formation near the summit, which in [[Buddhist]] tradition is held to be the footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition that of [[Shiva]] and in [[Muslim]] and [[Christian]] tradition that of [[Adam]], or that of St. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5531/|title=Seruwila to Sri Pada (Sacred Foot Print Shrine)|publisher = UNESCO.org|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The mountain is located in the southern reaches of the Central Highlands, in the Ratnapura district of the [[Sabaragamuwa Province]] - lying about 40&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the city of [[Ratnapura]].  The surrounding region is largely forested hills, with no mountain of comparable size nearby. The region along the mountain is a wildlife reserve housing many species varying from elephants to leopards, and including many endemic species.

Adam's Peak is important as the main watershed of Srilanka, four of the principal rivers of the Island, including the Mahaveli Ganga, the longest, having their source from this mountain, and descend to the sea on the eastern, western and south eastern coasts. The districts to the south and the east of Adam's Peak yield precious stones-emeralds, rubies and sapphires, for which the island has been famous, and which earned for its ancient name of Ratnadvipa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palihapitiya|title=P.G.G.|url=http://sripada.org/palihapitiya.htm|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trails==
Access to the mountain is possible by 6 trails: Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Hatton-Nallathanni, Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte &amp; Malimboda. The Nallathanni &amp; Palabaddala routes are most favored by those undertaking the climb, while the Kuruwita-Erathna trail is used less often; these trails are linked to major cities or town by bus, accounting for their popular use. The Murraywatte, Mookuwatte &amp; Malimboda routes are hardly used, but do intersect with the Palabaddala road midway through the ascent. The usual route taken by most pilgrims is ascent via Hatton and descent via Ratnapura; although the Hatton trail is the steepest, it is also shorter than any of the other trails by approximately five kilometers.
[[File:Sri Pada (Adam's peak) view. Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|Sri Pada (Adam's peak) view. Sri Lanka]]
Once one of the starting 'nodes' of Palabadalla, Nallathanni or Erathna are reached, the rest of the ascent is done on foot through the forested mountainside on the steps built into it. The greater part of the track leading from the base to the summit consists of thousands of steps built in cement or rough stones. The trails are illuminated with electric light, making night-time ascent possible and safe to do even when accompanied by children. Rest stops and wayside shops along the trails serve refreshments and supplies.

==Nomenclature==
[[Image:srilanka adams sunrise.jpg|thumb|200px|Sunrise on Adam's Peak]]
[[Image:Mahagiri Dambaya.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Mahagiri Dambaya]]
Due to its significance to the various people that inhabit the country, the mountain is referred to by a variety of names.

The often used ''Sri Pada'' is derived from [[Sanskrit]], used by the [[Sinhalese people]] in a religious context; this name also has meaning in [[Pali|Pāli]], and may be translated roughly as &quot;the sacred foot&quot;. It refers to the footprint-shaped mark at the summit, which is believed by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] to be that of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Christian and Islamic traditions assert that it is the footprint of [[Adam]], left when first setting foot on Earth after having been cast out of paradise, giving it the name &quot;Adam's Peak&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Hindu tradition refers to the footprint as that of the [[Hindu]] deity [[Shiva]], and thus names the mountain ''Shiva padam'' (Shiva's foot) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Tamils may also use the name ''Shivanolipatha Malai'' to refer to the mountain.

Another [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] name for the mountain is ''Samanalakanda'', which refers either to the deity Saman, who is said to live upon the mountain, or to the butterflies (''samanalayā'') that frequent the mountain during their annual migrations to the region. The name Sri Paada, however, is the more commonly used.

Other local and historic names include ''Ratnagiri'' (&quot;jewelled hill&quot;), ''Samantakuta'' (&quot;Peak of Saman&quot;), ''Svargarohanam'' (&quot;the climb to heaven&quot;), ''Mount Rohana'' and other variations on the root ''Rohana''.

==History==
Sri Pada is first mentioned (as `Samanthakuta') in the Deepawamsa, the earliest Pali chronicle, (4th century), and also in the 5th century chronicle [[Mahawamsa]], where it is stated that the Buddha visited the mountain peak. The chronicle ''Rajavaliya'' states that the  King Valagamba (1st century BCE) had taken refuge in the forests of Adam's Peak against invaders from India, and later returned to Anuradhapura. The Mahawamsa again mentions the visit of  King Vijayabahu I (1058-1114) to the mountain. The famous Chinese pilgrim and Buddhist traveler [[Fa Hien]] stayed in Sri Lanka in 411-12 CE and mentions Sri Pada  although it is not made clear whether he actually visited it. The Arab traveler Ibn Batuta on arriving on the island in 1344 CE, and [[Marco Polo]], have recorded their visits to Sri Pada. John Davy (1817) was the first English traveler to visit the peak, and recorded observing an oversized foot print carved in stone and ornamented with a single margin of brass and studded with gems.

==The Sacred Mountain==
[[Image:Maskeliya 01.jpg|thumb|200px|The village of Nallathanniya at the feet of the mountain, where the stairs begin]]
It is revered as a holy site by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Christians]]. It has specific qualities that cause it to stand out and be noticed; including its dominant and outstanding profile,  and the boulder at the peak that contains an indentation resembling a footprint. As the 1910, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] notes&lt;ref name =&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Chisolm|first=Hugh|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica (Vol. 5)|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=KjUEAAAAYAAJ| publisher=University press|year=1910|page=778}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;For a long period Sri Pada was supposed to be the highest mountain in Ceylon, but actual survey makes it only 7353 ft. above sea-level. This elevation is chiefly remarkable as the resort of pilgrims from all parts of the East. The hollow in the lofty rock that crowns the summit is said by the [[Hinduism|Brahmans]] to be the footstep of [[Shiva|Siva]], by the [[Buddhist]]s of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], by the [[Islam|Muslims]] of [[Adam]], whilst the Portuguese Christians were divided between the conflicting claims of [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]] and the [[eunuch]] of [[Candace]], queen of [[Ethiopia]]. The footstep is covered by a handsome roof, and is guarded by the priests of a rich monastery half-way up the mountain, who maintain a shrine on the summit of the peak.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is an important pilgrimage site, especially for Buddhists. Pilgrims walk up the mountain, following a variety of difficult routes up thousands of steps. The journey takes several hours at least. The peak [[pilgrimage]] season is in April, and the goal is to be on top of the mountain at sunrise, when the distinctive shape of the mountain casts a triangular shadow on the surrounding plain and can be seen to move quickly downward as the sun rises.

Climbing at night can be a remarkable experience, with the lights of the path leading up and into the stars overhead.  There are rest stops along the way.

===Legends===
[[Image:Sri Paada1.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A view of Adam's peak from [[Maskeliya]] town]]
The mountain is most often scaled from December to May. During other months it is hard to climb the mountain due to very heavy rain, extreme wind, and thick mist.

For Buddhists, the footprint mark is the left foot of the Buddha, left behind when Buddha visited Sri Lanka, as a symbol for worship at the invitation of Buddhist God Saman.

Tamil Hindus consider it as the footprint of Lord [[Shiva]]. It is also fabled that the mountain is the legendary mount [[Trikuta]] the capital of [[Ravana]] during the [[Ramayana]] times from where he ruled Lanka.

Muslims and Christians in Sri Lanka ascribe it to where [[Adam]], the first Ancestor, set foot as he was exiled from the Garden of Eden. The legends of Adam are connected to the idea that Sri Lanka was the original [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], and in the Muslim tradition that Adam was 30&amp;nbsp;ft tall.

A shrine to Saman, a Buddhist &quot;deity&quot; (People who have spent spiritual life during their life on earth and done pacificism service to regions are deified by Sri Lankan Buddhists) charged with protecting the mountain top, can be found near the footprint.

The '''Territory of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands''' is an [[States and territories of Australia|external territory]] of [[Australia]] consisting of two groups of small low-lying uninhabited tropical islands in the Indian Ocean situated on the edge of the [[continental shelf]] north-west of [[Australia]] and south of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Rote Island|Rote]].

==Geography==
The territory includes Ashmore Reef (West, Middle, and [[East Island (Ashmore and Cartier Islands)|East]] Islets) and [[Cartier Islands|Cartier Island]] (70&amp;nbsp;km east) with, a total area of {{convert|199.45|km²|0|abbr=on}} within the [[reef]]s and including the [[lagoons]], and 114,400 m² of dry land. While they have a total of {{convert|74.1|km|0|abbr=on}} of shoreline, measured along the outer edge of the reef, there are no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorage.

==Government==
The territory is administered from Canberra by the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport, which is also responsible for the administration of the territories of [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], the [[Coral Sea Islands]], [[Jervis Bay Territory]] and [[Norfolk Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author =  Assistant Director, Territories and Disaster Reconstruction Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.regional.gov.au/territories | publisher= Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport | date= 2012-06-16 | accessdate = 2008-02-07 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080206093322/http://www.regional.gov.au/territories| archivedate= 6 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the 2010 Federal Election, administrative responsibility for Territories was transferred from the Attorney General's Department to the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport. Defence of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]]. The islands are visited by seasonal caretakers.

Ashmore Reef is called ''Pulau Pasir'' by Indonesians, and considered part of [[Rote Ndao Regency]] of [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/5889136/Pulau_Pasir_Kabupaten_Rote_Ndao_district_Nusa_tenggara_Timur_province_INDONESIA Ashmore Reef, Ashmore and Cartier Islands (external territory of Australia)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Rote Island]] language, it is called ''Nusa Solokaek''. Both names have the meaning Sand Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspas.anu.edu.au/people/personal/foxxj_rspas/Fishermen_MOU_BOX.pdf The Settlement of Papela&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 2002 the nature reserve was recognised as a wetland of international importance when it was designated Ramsar Site 1220 under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]].&lt;ref name=ARL&gt;Annotated Ramsar List.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve ===
[[Image:Cartier Island.png|thumb|right|Cartier Island and surrounding reef ([[NASA]] satellite image)]]
The [[Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DSEWPC&quot;&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mpa/ashmore/index.html ''Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve and Cartier Island Marine Reserve'', Australian Government, Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities]&lt;/ref&gt; was established in August 1983 and covers {{convert|583|km2}}. It is of significant [[biodiversity]] value as it is in the flow of the [[Indonesian Throughflow]] ocean current from the Pacific Ocean through the [[Malay archipelago]] to the Indian Ocean. It is also in a surface current west from the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Timor Sea]].

The Reserve comprises several marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, intertidal sand flats, coral reef flats, and lagoons, and supports an important and diverse range of species, including 14 species of [[sea snake]]s, a population of [[Dugong]] that may be genetically distinct, a diverse [[marine invertebrate]] fauna, and many [[endemism|endemic]] species, especially of sea snakes and [[mollusc]]s. There are feeding and nesting sites for [[Loggerhead Turtle|Loggerhead]], [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green Turtle]]s.  It is classified as an [[Important Bird Area]]  and has 50,000 breeding pairs of various kinds of [[seabird]]s.  A high abundance and diversity of [[sea cucumber]]s, [[over-exploitation|over-exploited]] on other reefs in the region, is present, with 45 species recorded.&lt;ref name=ARL/&gt;

A memorandum of understanding between the Australian and Indonesian governments allows Indonesian fishermen access to their traditional fishing grounds within the region, subject to limits.

=== Cartier Island Marine Reserve ===
The [[Cartier Island Marine Reserve]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DSEWPC&quot; /&gt; was established in June 2000 and covers {{convert|172|km2}}.

==Economy and migration==
There is no economic activity in the Territory. As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it was a popular target for [[people smugglers]] transporting [[asylum seekers]] to Australia&lt;ref&gt;[http://insideindonesia.org/edit66/anita4.htm Inside Indonesia]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} Anita Roberts &quot;Don't let them drown&quot; ''Inside Indonesia'' Apr–Jun 2001, vol. 64&lt;/ref&gt; despite its only [[water well|well]]s being infected with [[cholera]] or contaminated and [[potable water|undrinkable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/news/NAVYNEWS/editions/1999/06_28_99/story03.htm Bizarre Happenings at Reef], [[Royal Australian Navy]] News, 28 June 1999, accessed 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had landed on Ashmore, asylum seekers could claim to have entered Australian territory and request to be processed as refugees. The use of Ashmore for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. As Australia was not the country of first asylum for these &quot;[[boat people]]&quot;, the Australian Government did not consider that it had a responsibility to accept them.

A number of things were done to discourage the practice such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces, and finally excising Ashmore and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]]. Two boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore after failed attempts by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.

'''Heir Island''' or '''Hare Island''', sometimes called '''Inishodriscol''' ({{Irish place name|Inis Uí Drisceoil|Ó Driscol's island}}) is an island that lies southwest of [[County Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It has a year-round population of around 25-30. The island is 2.5 km long and 1.5 km wide. It is the fourth largest of [[Carbery's Hundred Isles]], after [[Sherkin Island]], [[Clear Island]] and [[Long Island, County Cork|Long Island]]. It is close to Cunnamore Pier, which is its main access point. 

== History ==
The island was once inhabited by over 400 people. The McCarthy and O'Neill families are known for living on this island for years, the latter in fact owned the original island post office.{{fact|date=April 2013}} To make a living on the Island the inhabitants either fished or farmed the land but were often unable to make an adequate living, as a result many of the young people emigrated to England, USA and Australia. There are still many descendants of the original islanders living and working on the island. As a result of the emigration, many of the houses were sold in the 1960s and those who bought them often restored the original houses as holiday homes which visitors can see dotted around the island.  There is a small hamlet on the island; the old main residential area known as Paris which is noted for the bridge, which is only wide enough for one car to pass. This hamlet was once the centre of the island's fishing activities due to the fact that the landing, pickling and barrelling of the day's catch was done there.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

Many of the ruins on the island reflect upon these years when the island was home to a great deal more than today, the schoolhouse and the ruins of the schoolmaster's house are on the main road up the island. The island also has 2 piers and today the shop's location is in Burkes (home of the Roaringwater Sailing School). 

The island has a wild life preserve and several beaches; the most noted of these is the Sandy Beach or Trá Bán, a sandy stretch on the east side of the island, facing [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]]. The beach is used as a landing point for small craft during the summer months.

The main way to get to the island is via the island ferry, the M.V Thresher, which departs from Cunnamore point to the island's main pier 6 times a day, every 2 hours, from 8am to 6pm during the summer. This ferry also operates routes from adjacent islands and Baltimore upon special request. The Thresher is the main access point to Heir Island for visitors. 

Another ferry which services the islands is the M.V. Boy Colm which provides ferry services from Baltimore &amp; Cunnamore throughout the Summer months of July and August to Heir Island and to [[Sherkin Island]]. Unscheduled and special sailings to other destinations on this vessel are upon request. For angling trips, island and &quot;eco&quot; tours, the M.V. Norvic provides a service within Roaringwater Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heirislandferries.com/ |title=Heir Island Ferries |publisher=Heir Island Ferries |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One restaurant on the island is noted for its fresh &quot;catch of the day&quot;; which varies depending on season. Shrimp, lobster, salmon, crab and a variety of local fish are served at the restaurant called, &quot;The Island Cottage&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandsofireland.com/IndividualResultTCS.aspx?touristItemID=62102 |title=Heir Island |publisher=Islandsofireland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurant patrons can avail of a special ferry departing from Cunnamore at 8pm and returning at 12 midnight. The restaurant is by booking only - as is the ferry for the night service.

== Geography ==
Over 200 species of wildflower grow on Heir Island. The island has many beaches, as well as cliffs on the most south-westerly point known as The Dún. The island is surrounded by Carbery's Hundred Isles and has a view of [[Mount Gabriel]] near [[Schull]]. It has {{convert|360|acre|km2}} of fertile land, some of which is set-aside. 

Every year there is a special mass for all the children that died on the island during famine or from illness, at the children's famine memorial. This memorial is located near the Old-Schoolhouse in the centre of the island and is marked with a large cross.

== Tourism ==
The permanent population of Heir Island is only 25-30, but during summer months when the holiday homes are occupied the population increases to around 150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heirislandsailingschool.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=55&amp;Itemid=75&amp;lang=en |title=Heir Island |publisher=Heirislandsailingschool.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the small island does not have a pub, it has B&amp;Bs, holiday rentals, an art gallery, a sailing school and outdoor activities camp, a holistic therapy centre, one permanent restaurant and one pop-up restaurant which is located in the Sailing School. Fresh bread is also made at the Firehouse Bakery. The island is also home to a handful of artists, and their work is show in the  galleries on the island. The island is also a popular location for bird watchers, due to its mixture of eco-systems; coastal, forest, marsh and heathland.

The '''Charles River''' is an {{convert|80|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long river that flows in an overall northeasterly direction in eastern [[Massachusetts]]. From its source in [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]], the river travels through 23 cities and towns until reaching the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://crwa.org/watershed.html |title= Charles River Watershed |publisher= The Charles River Watershed Association |date= |accessdate= February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes called the '''River Charles''' or simply the '''Charles'''.

==Hydrography==
The Charles River is fed by about 80 [[stream]]s and several major [[aquifer]]s as it flows 80 miles (129&amp;nbsp;km),&lt;ref&gt;http://architectureboston.com/2010/05/13/how-long-is-the-charles-river/{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2013}} starting at Echo Lake ({{coord|42.193012|N|71.5119|W|display=inline}}) in Hopkinton, through 23 cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts before emptying into [[Boston Harbor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Thirty-three lakes and ponds and 35 communities are entirely or partially part of the Charles River [[drainage basin]]. Despite the river's length and relatively large drainage area (308 square miles; 798&amp;nbsp;km²), its source is only 26 miles (42&amp;nbsp;km) from its mouth, and the river drops only 350 feet (107 m) from source to sea. The Charles River watershed contains over 8,000 acres of protected wetlands, referred to as Natural Valley Storage. These areas are important in preventing downstream flooding and providing natural habitats to native species.

[[Brandeis University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Boston University]], and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] are all located along the Charles River. Near its mouth, it forms the border between downtown Boston and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]]. The river opens into a broad basin and is lined by the parks of the [[Charles River Reservation]]. On the [[Charles River Esplanade]] stands the [[Hatch Shell]], where concerts are given in summer evenings. The basin is especially known for its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration.  The middle section of the river between the [[Watertown Dam]] and [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] is partially protected by the properties of the [[Upper Charles River Reservation]] and other state parks, including the [[Hemlock Gorge Reservation]], [[Cutler Park]], and the [[Elm Bank Reservation]].

==Recreation==
The river is well known for its [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[sculling]], [[dragonboating]], and [[sailing]], both recreational and competitive. The river may also be [[kayak]]ed; depending on the season, however, kayakers can only navigate the Charles by getting out and dragging their kayaks for significant stretches. The &quot;Lower Basin&quot; between the [[Longfellow Bridge|Longfellow]] and [[Harvard Bridge|Harvard]] bridges is home to [[Community Boating]], the Harvard University Sailing Center, and the MIT Sailing Pavilion. The [[Head of the Charles Regatta]] is held here every October.  In early June, the annual Hong Kong Boston Dragon boat Festival is held in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], near the [[John W. Weeks Bridge|Weeks Footbridge]].

The [[Charles River Bike Path]] runs {{convert|23|mi}} along the banks of the Charles, starting at the Museum of Science and passing the campuses of MIT, Harvard and Boston University. The path is popular with runners and bikers. Many runners gauge their distance and speed by keeping track of the mileage between the bridges along the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/track/indoor/bridges.html |title=Charles River Mileage Map/Table |work=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a number of years, the [[Charles River Speedway]] operated along part of the river.

On July 13, 2013, [[human swimming|swimming]] for the general public was permitted for the first time in more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brody |first=Sharon |url=http://www.wbur.org/2013/07/13/public-swim-charles |title=Public Swim Follows 50 Years Of Dirty Water |publisher=WBUR |date=2013-07-13 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Charles River (Pear Biter).jpg|right|thumb|View of the Charles River and Boston at night]]
The river's name, preceding the English version, was once thought to be '''Quinobequin''' (meandering), though that attribution has been discredited by, among others, the Harvard University Librarian in 1850.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The river was used by Native Americans for local transportation and fishing and as part of the passage from southeastern Massachusetts to northern New England.

[[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]] explored and mapped the coast of New England, naming many features, originally naming the Charles River the Massachusetts River, which was derived from the [[Massachusett people|tribe living in the region]]. When Smith presented his map to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] he suggested that the king should feel free to change any of the &quot;barbarous names&quot; for &quot;English&quot; ones. The king made many such changes, but only four survive today, one of which is the Charles River which Charles named for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R.

In portions of its length, the Charles drops slowly in elevation and has relatively little current. Despite this, early settlers in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], found a way to use the Charles to power mills. In 1639, the town dug a canal from the Charles to a nearby brook that drained to the [[Neponset River]]. By this action, a portion of the Charles's flow was diverted, providing enough current for several mills. The new canal and the brook together are now called [[Mother Brook]]. The canal is regarded as the first industrial canal in North America. Today it remains in use for [[flood control]].

[[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] was the site of the first fully integrated textile factory in America, built by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] in 1814,&lt;ref name=FrancisCabotLowellPBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/lowell_hi.html|title=Who Made America? Pioneers: Francis Cabot Lowell|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 19th century the Charles River was one of the most industrialized areas in the United States. Its [[hydropower]] soon fueled many mills and factories. By the century's end, 20 dams had been built across the river, mostly to generate power for industry. An 1875 government report listed 43 mills along the 9.5-mile (15&amp;nbsp;km) tidal estuary from [[Watertown Dam]] to Boston Harbor.

From 1816 to 1968, the U.S. Army operated a gun and ammunition storage and later production facility known as the [[Watertown Arsenal]].  While it was key to many of the nation's war efforts over its several decades in operation, not the least of which being the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War I]], its location in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] so near the Charles did great environmental harm.  The arsenal was declared a [[Super Fund]] site, and after its closure by the government it had to be cleaned at significant expense before it could be safely used again for other purposes.  Likewise, the many factories and mills along the banks of the Charles supported a buoyant economy in their time but left a legacy of massive pollution.

==Creation of modern Boston-Cambridge basin==
{{main|Charles River Reservation}}
[[File:Charles River Esplanade, Boston, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|A sunny day on the Charles River Esplanade]]
Today's Charles River basin between Boston and Cambridge is almost entirely a work of human design. [[Owen A. Galvin]] was appointed head of the Charles River Improvement Commission by Governor [[William Russell (governor)|William E. Russell]] in 1891. Their work led to the design initiatives of noted [[landscape architect]]s [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] and [[Arthur Shurcliff]], both of whom had apprenticed with [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Guy Lowell]]. This designed landscape includes over 20 parks and natural areas along 19 miles (31&amp;nbsp;km) of shoreline, from the [[Charles River Reservation#Charles River Dam|New Dam]] at the Charlestown Bridge to the dam near Watertown Square.

Eliot first envisioned today's river design in the 1890s, an important model being the layout of the [[Alster]] basin in [[Hamburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Haglund|title=Inventing the Charles River|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-262-08307-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but major construction began only after Eliot's death with the damming of the river's mouth at today's [[Boston Museum of Science]], an effort led by [[James Jackson Storrow]]. The new dam, completed in 1910, stabilized the water level from Boston to Watertown, eliminating the existing mud flats, and a narrow embankment was built between Leverett Circle and Charlesgate. After Storrow's death, his widow Mrs. James Jackson Storrow donated $1 million toward the creation of a more generously landscaped park along the Esplanade; it was dedicated in 1936 as the Storrow Memorial Embankment. This also enabled the construction of many public docks in the Charles River Basin. In the 1950s a highway ([[Storrow Drive]]) was built along the edge of the Esplanade to connect Charles Circle with Soldiers Field Road, and the Esplanade was enlarged on the water side of the new highway.

The [[Inner Belt]] highway was proposed to cross the Charles River at the [[Boston University Bridge]], but its construction was canceled in the 1970s.

==Pollution and remediation efforts==
As [[sewage]], [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] and [[urban runoff]] flowed freely into the river from the surrounding city, the Charles River became well known for its high level of [[water pollution|pollutants]], gaining such notoriety that by 1955, [[Bernard DeVoto]] wrote in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' that the Charles was &quot;foul and noisome, polluted by offal and industrious wastes, scummy with oil, unlikely to be mistaken for water.&quot;
&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot; /&gt; It was not an uncommon sight to see [[toxicity|toxins]] coloring the river pink and orange in spots, fish kills and submerged cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;BostonLawsuit&quot;&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/04/24/group_eyes_lawsuit_over_charles_river_pollution/?page=2 Group Eyes Lawsuit Over Charles River Pollution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once popular with swimmers, awareness of the river's high pollution levels forced the state to shut down several popular swimming areas, including Cambridge's Magazine Beach and Gerry Landing public beaches. Until very recently, rowers and sailors who fell into the water were advised to go to the hospital for [[tetanus]] shots.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot;&gt;[http://www.charlesriverconservancy.org/projects/swimming/index.html Swimming in the Charles River]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2013}}

Efforts to clean up the river and restore it to a state where swimming and fishing would be acceptable began as early as the 1960s, and the program to clean up the Charles for good took shape in 1965 with the creation of the Charles River Watershed Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRWA&quot;&gt;[http://www.crwa.org Charles River Watershed Association, includes swimmability maps]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] declared a goal of making the river swimmable by 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot; /&gt; In 1996, Governor [[William Weld]] plunged, fully clothed, into the river to prove his commitment to cleaning up the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;welddive&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/september96/kerry_weld_9-19.html Online NewsHour: KERRY / WELD: DEAD HEAT]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, the river hosted the Charles River Masters Swim Race, the first sanctioned race in the Charles in over five decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcom Glenn|Malcom A. Glenn]], [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=519359 Brown Charles Gets Green Light], Harvard Crimson, July 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination of public and private initiatives helped dramatically lower levels of pollutants by focusing on eliminating [[combined sewer overflow]]s and storm water [[surface runoff|runoff]]. A new [[Charles River Dam]] was constructed downstream from the Science Museum site to keep [[seawater|salt water]] out of the basin. Since Weld's stunt, the river's condition has improved dramatically, although it was not deemed entirely swimmable by 2005. In 1995 the EPA rated the river's quality as a &quot;D&quot; compared to the most recent ranking of a &quot;B&quot;, and most days of the year the river now meets swimming standards below the [[Harvard Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot; /&gt; With the improved [[water quality]], swimming and fishing are progressively re-emerging as about 90% of the length of the river is now considered safe for swimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRWA&quot;/&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2013}}
[[File:Sunset Charles River Boston.jpg|thumb|Sunset at Charles River in December 2010]]

The [[Conservation Law Foundation]] opposes the permit given to [[Mirant]] for the Mirant Kendall Generating Station, an electricity plant near [[Kendall Square]], charging that the water it releases causes blooms of hazardous [[microorganism]]s because of its warm temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clf.org/newsroom/conservation-law-foundation-secures-groundbreaking-outcome-in-genon-kendall-plant-case/ |title=Conservation Law Foundation Secures Groundbreaking Outcome in GenOn Kendall Plant Case &amp;#124; Conservation Law Foundation |work=Clf.org |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common belief that the water quality of the Charles River is at its worst after a large rainfall because of pollutants carried by runoff. However, a study, published in the Journal of the American Water Resources Association (April 2008) completed by researchers at Northeastern University found high concentrations of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] [[bacteria]] in the Charles River after a long period of no rain. Using a [[mathematical model]], the researchers then determined that two major tributaries, the [[Stony Brook (Boston)|Stony Brook]] and [[Muddy River, Massachusetts|Muddy River]], are the predominant sources of E. coli in the lower Charles River.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/540300/ Researcher Develops Model to Track E. coli in Charles River] Newswise, Retrieved on August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muskingum University''' is a private four-year comprehensive college located in [[New Concord, Ohio|New Concord]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. It is located approximately sixty miles east of the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. 

The university was founded in 1837.

Muskingum University is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], although since the 1960s the school's religious nature has diminished. 

Collectively, the university's alumni are referred to as the ''&quot;Long Magenta Line&quot;'' and students (both past and present) are known simply as ''&quot;Muskies&quot;''. [[New Concord, Ohio]] is located in far eastern [[Muskingum County, Ohio|Muskingum County]], which derives its name from the [[Muskingum River]]. Hence the often misspelled and mispronounced Delaware Indian word ''Muskingum'' (translation- ''&quot;village on the river bank&quot;'' and/or ''&quot;glare of an elk's eye&quot;''- there's a dispute) was used in naming the school. In June 2009, the institution's name was changed from &quot;Muskingum College&quot; to &quot;Muskingum University&quot;. 

The university's colors are [[black]] and [[magenta]] and the school's mascot is the “Fighting Muskie” (the [[muskellunge]], the largest member of the pike family). 

The university's motto is ''&quot;Omni, Trinum, Perfectum&quot;'', Latin for ''&quot;Everything which comes in threes is perfect&quot;'', which is a reference to both the [[Christian]] [[Trinity]] and Muskingum's mission to develop their students' minds, bodies and souls.

Muskingum offers more than 40 academic majors. The newest programs launched are digital media design, criminal justice, and engineering. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) program has also been initiated. 

Graduate programs are offered in education and management information systems, strategy and technology. Muskingum is nationally known{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} for its innovative PLUS program, a service which assists students with learning disabilities cope, adjust, and ultimately succeed in a higher learning environment.

Muskingum's campus consists of 21 major buildings, a football stadium and a small lake, which all sit atop {{convert|225|acre|km2}} of rolling hills overlooking New Concord. The beauty of the campus was recently captured in ''&quot;A Song of the Seasons: Paintings by Jianmin Dou&quot;'' by Donna Edsall and Yan Sun (2003).

==History==
In 1827, the [[National Road]] (now [[U.S. 40]]) was laid through what is now New Concord, roughly following what had been the primitive roadway known as [[Zane's Trace]]. A year later, the village of [[New Concord, Ohio]] was established by Scotch-Irish [[Presbyterians]]. On July 9, 1836, the first recorded meeting of the ''&quot;Friends of Education&quot;'' in New Concord, led by New Concord residents Samuel Willson and Benjamin Waddle, was held. A year later, the [[Ohio General Assembly]] authorized the creation of a college in [[New Concord, OH]] after being petitioned by the ''&quot;Friends of Education&quot;'' committee. On April 24, 1837, Muskingum College opened. Muskingum became a coeducational institution in 1854. In 1958, the [[United Presbyterian Church of North America]] (UPCNA) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] (PCUSA) merge by signing a historic agreement in Brown Chapel. In 2001, the school's women's [[softball]] team captured the [[NCAA]] Division III National Championship, the school's first national title.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Fisk, &quot;The Early Years Of Muskingum College,&quot; ''Old Northwest'' 1979 5(1): 19-44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Muskingum has been continuously accredited by the North Central Association of College and Secondary Schools since 1919. ''&quot;The school up on the hills&quot;'', as it is sometimes called by locals, offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees at the undergraduate level, and at the graduate level [http://www.muskingum.edu/~misst Master of Information Strategy Systems and Technology],  [[Master of Arts in Education]], and [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] graduate degrees. The school offers 44 [[academic major]]s along with a large number of [[Minor (law)|minors]], 9 pre-professional programs (including [[pre-law]] and pre-medicine) and teaching licensure, all of which must be pursued within a strong [[liberal arts]] curriculum, known at Muskingum as the ''&quot;Liberal Arts Essentials&quot;'' (LAEs) (see below). Among Muskingum's strongest undergraduate academic programs are its science division, math program, education department, and journalism program. Muskingum is often proclaimed as a &quot;best value&quot; in education, by combining strong academics with low tuition, by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' and similar publications. In their 2008 ''America's Best College's'' guide, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' ranked Muskingum the &quot;31st Best Master's Level University&quot; in the Midwest academically.[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1univmas_mw_brief.php] and the &quot;4th Best Value&quot; among Midwest Master's Level Universities [http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/bvunivmas_mw_brief.php].

==Campus==
Most of Muskingum's academic buildings are clustered around a traditional quad near the southern part of the campus. The quad is bordered by Montgomery Hall and the College Library to the south, Caldwell Hall, Cambridge Hall and the Student/Faculty Center to the west, the Recreation Center and John Glenn Gym to the north and Boyd Science Center to the east. Brown Chapel sits on the southeastern corner of the quad.
*'''Paul Hall''' (1873) is the oldest building on Muskingum's campus. Two previous versions of this building burnt down early in the school's history. This third structure is named for Dr. David Paul, president of the College from 1865 to 1879. The building, which currently houses the music department, is registered as a National Historic Site.
*'''Johnson Hall''' (1899) is named for Dr. Jesse Johnson, Muskingum's president from 1883 to 1902. Renovated in 1977, it contained art studios, the Louis Palmer Gallery and a 160-seat proscenium thrust theater. Johnson Hall was torn down in 2009 to make room for Walter Hall.
*'''The Little Theater''' (1900) was constructed for physical education purposes and remodeled in 1943 for theatrical use, and was used as classroom space primarily in theatre until it was torn down in 2009.
*'''Brown Chapel''' (1912) is a multi-purpose building which serves the College as a church, chapel, auditorium and classroom. The Chapel was named for J.M. Brown, a benefactor of the College and long-time member of the school's board of trustees.
*'''Montgomery Hall''' (1921) is the administrative hub of the campus, containing administrative and faculty offices and classrooms. The building is named for Dr. John Knox Montgomery Sr., president of Muskingum from 1904 until 1931, and the unofficial ''&quot;Father of Muskingum College&quot;''.
*'''Cambridge Hall''' (1929) was built largely with funds contributed by citizens of nearby Cambridge, OH. Along with classrooms, the business, English, political science, psychology, sociology, history departments.
*'''John Glenn Gym''' (1935) was named in 1962 in honor of the distinguished astronaut-senator graduate. It houses two gymnasiums, a swimming pool, recreation and intramural equipment and coaches' offices.
*'''The College Library''' (1960) holds more than 215,000 volumes.
*'''The Student/Faculty Center''' (1960) includes the campus center, snack bar, mailroom, bookstore, and meeting rooms. It also houses the Student Life Office, the Office of Career Services, Internships and Leadership Development, Student Senate, Student Activities, Counciling and Special Events.
*'''Boyd Science Center''' (1971) is a four-floor building housing the biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, modern languages, computer science and physics departments.
*'''Recreation Center''' (1986) is a four-story building holding a 2,800-seat gym, dance rooms, racquetball courts, weight room, athletic training room and locker rooms. The &quot;Rec&quot; Center also houses the physical education department and the athletic department.
*'''Caldwell Hall''' (2004) a {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. sq., state-of-the-art{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} facility houses Muskingum’s speech, journalism and theatre programs, and graphic arts initiative. This 21st century instructional space features multi-media classrooms, computer-aided design laboratory, lecture hall, seminar rooms, exhibit hall, radio and television studios, a 250-seat theatre, recital hall and cinema, costume &amp; set design laboratories, tech support areas and an experimental theatre/rehearsal hall.
*'''Chess Center''' (2008) a {{convert|23000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. sq., state-of-the-art{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} campus center. featuring a three-level forum where students gather, socialize, study, work, &amp; work out. The innovative design of this new building also &quot;bridges&quot; the east and west hills of the campus.
*'''The Neptune Center''' (2008) This new building is home for the Art Department’s program in ceramics, sculpture, and other three-dimensional creative work.
*'''Walter Hall''' (2010) - Dedicated in April 2011.   Has become the new home for music program, world languages and the Center for the Advancement of Learning (PLUS program).

==Athletics==
Muskingum competes athletically in the [[NCAA]] as a Division III school and as one of the first and longest affiliated members of the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] (OAC). M.U.'s teams compete under the name the [[Fighting Muskies]]. Rather than using the traditional magenta, Muskies athletics wear black and red. The school's main athletic rival is fellow OAC competitor the [[Marietta College]] Pioneers (which ironically was originally called the Muskingum Academy when established in 1797). Muskingum fields teams in [[American football]], women's [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], women's [[softball]], [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]] and men's and women's indoor [[Track and field|track]], outdoor track, [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[Cross country running|cross country]] and [[golf]].
Muskingum has won 79 [[Ohio Athletic Conference]] (OAC) Championships, since the school joined the conference in 1923:
*Baseball Championship (1952)
*Men's Basketball Regular Season Championships (1972–73, 1973–74, 1950–51)
*Men's Basketball Tournament Championships (1989–90, 1987–88, 1976–77, 1936–37, 1927–28, 1926–27, 1925–26)

During the period between 1925- 1970 Muskingum was known as a football powerhouse in the OAC, led by college football Hall of Famer [[Edgar Sherman]], first as a player and then as head coach. The Muskies even represented the OAC in two Grantland Rice Bowls (1964 &amp; 1966) and won 12 OAC football championships during that forty-five year period. Through the years the M.C. men's basketball team has also seen success, having won 3 regular season OAC championships and 7 OAC tournament championships. In more recent years, the Muskingum women's softball teams have achieved considerable success, winning every OAC regular season championship since 1998 and the NCAA Division III national championship in 2001.  Muskingum's softball coach Donna Newberry holds the record for the most victories in NCAA Division III history.

Collectively, Muskingum's alumni are referred to as the ''&quot;Long Magenta Line&quot;''.  Muskingum College's favorite son is former [[astronaut]] and U.S. senator [[John Glenn]], who graduated with a [[bachelor of science]] in 1962, the same year he became the first American to orbit the Earth (Glenn also has an honorary degree from Muskingum from 1961, but the B.S. he earned in 1962 is an earned degree). In 1983, John Glenn launched his [[White House]] bid from the Muskingum College quad in the heart of the campus. Glenn also announced his retirement from the [[United States Senate]] in Brown Chapel on live national television in 1997. Upon his retirement, Glenn donated his archives to the [[Ohio State University]], with special conditions that Muskingum students would benefit from the collection at any time.  Muskingum received national media attention once again in 1998, when a 77 year old Glenn returned to space aboard the [[Space Shuttle Discovery]], becoming the oldest person ever in space.

'''Whitestown''' is a fast growing community located in parts of Worth Township, Perry Township and Eagle Township, [[Boone County, Indiana|Boone County]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. It is northwest of [[Indianapolis]]. The population was 2,867 at the 2010 census.

Whitestown is located along Interstate 65, between the exits at State Road 334 (exit 130) and State Road 267 (exit 133). Students in Whitestown attend two school systems. Those in Worth Township and Perry Township attend Lebanon Community Schools. Those in Eagle Township attend Zionsville Community Schools.

In this town, a new development is underway for a {{convert|1700|acre|km2|adj=on}} mixed use community called Anson. The Anson area of Whitestown is a home to many new businesses, including Express Scripts (formerly known as Medco Health Solutions).  

The Anson area includes residential, office, healthcare and retail developments, including a [[Lowe's]] home improvement center, McDonalds, several banks, Whitham Health Services &amp; Emergency Room. 
 
The Anson master planned community is being developed by Duke Realty Corporation [http://www.dukerealty.com].  The north side of the campus is called AllPoints at Anson and is a joint development between Duke and Browning Investments [http://www.allpointsindiana.com/apa.aspx]. 

The Anson development is named for Boone County native [[Anson Mills]], an accomplished surveyor, builder, civil engineer, Union Army officer, inventor, diplomat, and author.

When finished, Anson is expected to directly employ nearly 25,000 people with an annual payroll of more than $868 million.

Whitestown is part of the fast developing outer-ring suburbs of Indianapolis.

The '''Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Saint Kitts and Nevis.ogg|s|eɪ|n|t|_|ˌ|k|ɪ|t|s|_|æ|n|d|_|ˈ|n|iː|v|ɪ|s}}; also known as the '''Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis'''),&lt;ref&gt;Both the names Saint Christopher and Saint Kitts are given in the [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html Constitution of Saint Christopher and Nevis].&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Leeward Islands]], is a federal two-island state in the [[West Indies]]. It is the smallest sovereign state in the Americas, in both [[List of countries by area|area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]].

The capital city and headquarters of government for the federated state is [[Basseterre]] on the larger island of [[Saint Christopher]]. The smaller island of [[Nevis]] lies about 2 miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called &quot;The Narrows&quot;.

Historically, the British dependency of [[Anguilla]] was also a part of this union, which was then known collectively as [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]]. Saint Kitts and Nevis are geographically part of the Leeward Islands. To the north-northwest lie the islands of [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Saba]] (the [[Netherlands]]), [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]] and Anguilla. To the east and northeast are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of [[Redonda]], and the island of [[Montserrat]], which currently has an active volcano (see [[Soufrière Hills]]).

Saint Kitts and Nevis were among the first islands in the Caribbean to be settled by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first English and French colonies in the [[Caribbean]], and thus has also been titled &quot;The Mother Colony of the West Indies&quot;.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Saint Kitts was named &quot;[[Mount Liamuiga|Liamuiga]]&quot; by the Kalinago Indians who inhabited the island. This name, roughly translated, in English means &quot;fertile land,&quot; a testimony to the island's rich volcanic soil and high productivity.

Nevis's pre-Columbian name was &quot;Oualie,&quot; which translates to &quot;land of beautiful waters,&quot; presumably referring to the island's many freshwater springs and hot volcanic springs.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Christopher Columbus]], upon sighting what we now call Nevis in 1493, gave that island the name ''San Martin'' (Saint Martin). However, the confusion of numerous, poorly charted small islands in the Leeward Island chain, meant that the name ended up being accidentally transferred to another island, the one which we now know as the French/Dutch island [[Saint Martin|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]].

The current name &quot;Nevis&quot; is derived from a Spanish name ''Nuestra Señora de las Nieves'' (The original name was the archaic Spanish ''&quot;Noestra Siñora delas Neves&quot;''), by a process of abbreviation and [[anglicisation]]. This Spanish name means [[Our Lady of the Snows (liturgical feast)|Our Lady of the Snows]]. It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a fourth-century Catholic miracle: a snowfall on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome. Presumably the white clouds which usually wreathe the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate. The island of Nevis, upon first British settlement, was referred to as &quot;Dulcina,&quot; a name meaning &quot;sweet one.&quot; Its original Spanish name, &quot;Nuestra Señora de las Nieves,&quot; was eventually kept however, though it was soon shortened to &quot;Nevis.&quot;

There is some disagreement over the name which Columbus gave to St. Kitts. For many years it was thought that he named the island ''San Cristobal'', after his patron saint [[Saint Christopher]], the saint of travelling. However, new studies suggest that Columbus named the island ''Sant Yago'' (Saint James). The name &quot;San Cristobal&quot; was apparently given by Columbus to the island now known as [[Saba]], 20 miles northwest. It seems that &quot;San Cristobal&quot; came to be applied to the island of St. Kitts only as the result of a mapping error.

No matter the origin of the name, the island was well documented as &quot;San Cristobal&quot; by the 17th century. The first English colonists kept the English translation of this name, and dubbed it &quot;St. Christopher's Island.&quot; In the 17th century Kit, or Kitt, was a common nickname for the name Christopher, and so the island was often informally referred to as &quot;Saint Kitt's island,&quot; which was further shortened to &quot;Saint Kitts.&quot;

Today, the Constitution refers to the state as both &quot;Saint Kitts and Nevis&quot; and &quot;Saint Christopher and Nevis,&quot; but the former is the one most commonly used.

==History==
{{Main|History of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

[[Image:StKitts Brimstomhill.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Battle of Saint Kitts]], 1782, as described by an observer in a French engraving titled &quot;Attaque de Brimstomhill&quot;.]]
Five thousand years prior to European arrival, the island was settled by Native Americans. The last wave of Native American arrivals, the [[Kalinago]] people, arrived approximately three centuries before the Europeans. The islands were discovered by the Europeans through a Spanish expedition under Columbus in 1493. In 1538, French Huguenots established a settlement on St. Kitts but the settlement was destroyed by the Spanish soon afterwards and the survivors were deported. In 1623, an English settlement was established, which was soon followed by French settlements, the island being divided by agreement. Dissimilar to many other islands, the local Kalinago people on the island allowed Europeans to colonise Saint Kitts. In 1626, the Anglo-French settlers [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626|massacred]] the Kalinago.

A Spanish expedition, sent to enforce Spanish claims, [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|destroyed]] the English and French colonies and deported the settlers back to their respective countries in 1629. As part of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1625-1630)|the war]] settlement in 1630, the Spanish permitted the re-establishment of the English and French colonies.

As Spanish power went into decline, Saint Kitts became the premier base for English and French expansion into the Caribbean, as the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]] for the English, and [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[Saint Barthélemy|St. Barts]] for the French were colonised from it. During the late 17th century, France and England battled for control over St Kitts. It was ceded to Britain in 1713.

Although small in size, and separated by only {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} of water, the two islands were viewed and governed as different states until the late 19th century, when they were forcibly unified along with the island of Anguilla by the British. To this day relations are strained, with Nevis accusing Saint Kitts of neglecting its needs.

Saint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, became an [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla|associated state]] with full internal autonomy in 1967. Anguillians rebelled, and separated from the others in 1971. St. Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983. It is the newest sovereign state in the Americas. In August 1998, a vote in Nevis on a [[Nevis independence referendum, 1998|referendum to separate]] from St. Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Nevis islanders apparently vote not to break away |date= 11 August 1998 |agency= Associated Press |newspaper= Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D6gaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ey8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4918,21223&amp;dq=saint+kitts+nevis+referendum+1998&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September 1998, [[Hurricane Georges]] caused approximately $458,000,000 in damages and property and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond. Georges was the worst hurricane to hit the region in the century.

==Politics==
&lt;!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series--&gt;
{{Main|Politics of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
Saint Kitts and Nevis is a sovereign, democratic and federal state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/constitutions/kitts/kitts83.html Art. 1, Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis Constitutional Order of 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen of Saint Christopher and Nevis]], [[Monarchy of St. Kitts and Nevis|Elizabeth II]] is its [[head of state]]. The Queen is represented in the country by a [[List of Governors-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]], who acts on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Prime Minister]] and the Cabinet. The Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party of the House, and the cabinet conducts affairs of state. The country may also be described by the unofficial term, &quot;[[Commonwealth realm]]&quot;, because it is a constitutional monarchy which shares the same monarch as some other members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

St. Kitts and Nevis has a [[unicameral]] legislature, known as the [[National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis|National Assembly]]. It is composed of fourteen members: eleven elected Representatives (three from the island of [[Nevis]]) and three Senators who are appointed by the [[Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Governor-General]]. Two of the senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, and one on the advice of the leader of the opposition. Unlike in other countries, senators do not constitute a separate [[Senate]] or [[upper house]] of parliament, but sit in the National Assembly, alongside representatives. All members serve five-year terms. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament.

Saint Kitts and Nevis is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Parishes of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
The federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is divided into fourteen parishes: nine divisions on Saint Kitts and five on Nevis.

{{Main|Geography of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
{{See also|List of cities in Saint Kitts and Nevis|List of volcanoes in Saint Kitts and Nevis}}
The country has two main islands, [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]]. The highest peak, at 1,156 metres, is [[Mount Liamuiga]].

The islands are of [[volcanic]] origin, with large central peaks covered in [[tropical rainforest]]; the steeper slopes leading to these peaks are mostly uninhabited. The majority of the population on both islands lives closer to the sea where the terrain flattens out. There are numerous rivers descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population. St. Kitts also has one small lake.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

Saint Kitts and Nevis is a twin-island federation whose economy is characterised by its dominant tourism, agriculture and light manufacturing industries. Sugar was the primary export from the 1640s on, but rising production costs, low world market prices, and the government's efforts to reduce dependence on it have led to a growing diversification of the agricultural sector. In 2005, the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company, which had experienced losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit.

Former sugar plantations still dominate the St. Kitts landscape, however many of the cane fields are being burned to make room for land development, especially on the northern side of the island, in the parishes of Saint John Capisterre and Christchurch. The agricultural, tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore-banking sectors are being developed and are now taking larger roles in the country's economy. The growth of the tourism sector has become the main foreign exchange earner for Saint Kitts and Nevis. The country has also developed a successful apparel assembly industry and one of the largest electronics assembly industries in the Caribbean.

St. Kitts is dependent on tourism to drive its economy. Tourism to the island has been expanding since 1978. In 2009 there were 587,479 arrivals to Saint Kitts compared to 379,473 in 2007. This growth represents an increase of just under 40% in a two-year period. As tourism grows the demand for vacation property increases in conjunction.

In hopes of expanding tourism, the country hosts its annual [[St. Kitts Music Festival]].

St Kitts &amp; Nevis also acquires foreign direct investment from their ''citizenship by investment program'', outlined in their Citizenship Act of 1984. Interested parties can acquire citizenship if they pass the government's background checks and make an investment into an approved real estate development.

===Economic Citizenship by Investment===
St. Kitts allows [[Alien (law)|foreigner]]s to obtain the status of St. Kitts citizen by means of a government sponsored investment programme called Citizenship-by-Investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciu.gov.kn/ |title=Citizenship-by-Investment Introduction |date= |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1984, St. Kitts’ citizenship program is the oldest prevailing economic citizenship program of this kind in the world. This programme has international approval and acceptance.

St. Kitts’ Citizenship-by-Investment program offers multiple benefits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
