<p>In August of last year we ran a controversial look at 43 reasons <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2006/08/02/why-2007-will-be-a-great-year-for-movies/">why 2007 would be a great year</a> for movies. Now that 2007 has nearly come and gone and almost all of those 43 movies have been released, it's time to look ahead at <strong>2008</strong>. The last 12 months have played a major part in building the hype for most of the movies mentioned and I can now say that 2008 looks way more appealing at this moment than 2007 did at the same time last year. This could be the year that we see revolutionary new changes in Hollywood, not only as the Writers Strike ends but as we encounter films like <em>Cloverfield</em>, <em>Speed Racer</em>, and <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Let's take look at <strong>54 reasons</strong> why 2008 will be an awesome year for movies and an even better year than 2007.</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive list of what will make 2008 a truly memorable year for movies.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/schedule2008/"><strong>Please visit the 2008 Release Schedule for updated release dates as well as the entire list of films opening in 2008.</strong></a></p>
<p align="center"><em>Release dates listed below are subject to change.</em></p>
<h4 style="color:#900">21</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> March 28th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525659/">Robert Luketic</a> (<em>Legally Blonde</em>, <em>Monster-in-Law</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Jim Sturgess, Aaron Yoo, Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, Laurence Fishburne<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> <em>21</em> is the fact-based story about six MIT students who were trained to become experts in card counting and subsequently took Vegas casinos for millions in winnings.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> The <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/11/16/must-watch-21-trailer-card-counting-mit-students/">trailer</a> makes this look like it could be the next best Vegas / cards movie with a great cast, and it's based off of a great book to start.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Adventureland</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609549/">Greg Mottola</a> (<em>Superbad</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Jesse Eisenberg, Ryan Reynolds, Kristen Stewart, Martin Starr<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A comedy set in the summer of 1987 and centered around a recent college grad (Eisenberg) who takes a nowhere job at his local amusement park, only to find it's the perfect course to get him prepared for the real world.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> The director of <em>Superbad</em>, the late-summer sleeper hit comedy of 2007, is back again with a film he wrote that has a plot that sounds like it could rival <em>Knocked Up</em> or <em>Superbad</em>.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Australia</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525303/">Baz Luhrmann</a> (<em>Romeo + Juliet</em>, <em>Moulin Rouge</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, David Wenham<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscape, they experience the bombing of Darwin, Australia, by Japanese forces firsthand.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> I think just mentioning that this comes from the colorful mind of <em>Moulin Rouge's</em> Baz Luhrmann and stars Hugh Jackman is enough to confirm that this is one to definitely watch out for.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Babylon A.D.</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> August 29th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0440913/">Mathieu Kassovitz</a> (<em>Gothika</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Vin Diesel, Gérard Depardieu, Michelle Yeoh<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Veteran-turned-mercenary Thoorop (Diesel) takes the high-risk job of escorting a woman from Russia to China. Little does he know that she is host to an organism that a cult wants to harvest in order to produce a genetically modified Messiah.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> It looks like Vin Diesel is returning to his <em>Pitch Black</em> sci-fi roots and delivering a grungy, action-packed sci-fi film with some French finesse.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Be Kind Rewind</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> January 25th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0327273/">Michel Gondry</a> (<em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, <em>Science of Sleep</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Jack Black, Mos Def, Danny Glover, Mia Farrow, Melonie Diaz<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A man (Black) whose brain becomes magnetized unintentionally destroys every tape in his friend's video store. In order to satisfy the store's most loyal renter, an aging woman with signs of dementia, the two men set out to remake the lost films, which include <em>Back to the Future</em>, <em>The Lion King</em>, and <em>RoboCop</em>.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> If you haven't seen it, watch the <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/08/08/must-watch-michel-gondrys-be-kind-rewind-trailer/">trailer</a> now. Not only will VHS nostalgia hit hard, but you can't go wrong with the immensely creative Michel Gondry, Jack Black, and Mos Def all working together!</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Blindness</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> August 8th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0576987/">Fernando Meirelles</a> (<em>City of God</em>, <em>The Constant Gardener)</em><br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore, Gael Garcia Bernal, Danny Glover, Alice Braga<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A doctor's wife becomes the only person with the ability to see in a town where everyone is struck with a mysterious case of sudden blindness. She feigns illness in order to take care of her husband as her surrounding community breaks down into chaos and disorder.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Although <em>The Constant Gardener</em> wasn't a hit, anything <em>City of God</em> director Fernando Meirelles works on is guaranteed to be incredible, and this time around it sounds like it most certainly could be.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">The Box</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> Late 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446819/">Richard Kelly</a> (<em>Donnie Darko</em>, <em>Southland Tales</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> James Marsden, Cameron Diaz, Frank Langella<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A small wooden box arrives on the doorstep of a troubled married couple, who open it and become instantly wealthy. Little do they realize that opening the box also kills someone they do not know.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> <em>Donnie Darko</em> writer/director Richard Kelly is hopefully making a much more down-to-earth movie that's a solid thriller rather than an off-the-wall "apocalyptic comedy" like <em>Southland Tales</em>.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Burn After Reading</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> Late 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001054/">Joel Coen</a> &#038; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001053/">Ethan Coen</a> (<em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em>, <em>The Ladykillers</em>, <em>No Country for Old Men</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> George Clooney, John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A disk containing the memoirs of a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous gym employees who attempt to sell it.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> After directing one of 2007's most critically acclaimed movies, <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, the Coen's are already back finishing up <em>Burn After Reading</em>, and it seems like it could be another brilliant film.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">The Changeling</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/">Clint Eastwood</a> (<em>Mystic River</em>, <em>Million Dollar Baby</em>)<br />

<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A mother's prayer for her kidnapped son to return home is answered, though it doesn't take long for her to suspect the boy who comes back is not hers.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Eastwood steps back behind the camera with a script by J. Michael Straczynski ("He-Man and the Masters of the Universe", "Babylon 5") with what seems like a very promising period mystery story.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Choke</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> Late 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163988/">Clark Gregg</a><br />

<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A sex-addicted con-man pays for his mother's hospital bills by playing on the sympathies of those who rescue him from choking to death.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> The very next movie based on a book by Chuck Palahniuk since <em>Fight Club</em> in 1999. It's debuting at Sundance and I'm hoping Clark Gregg kept the story intact enough for it to be even remotely as good as <em>Fight Club</em>.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 16th, 2008<br />

<strong>Synopsis:</strong> The Pevensie siblings return to Narnia, where they are enlisted to once again help ward off an evil king and restore the rightful heir to the land's throne, Prince Caspian.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Although I'm not a huge fan of the first <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> from 2004, the <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/05/must-watch-chronicles-of-narnia-prince-caspian-trailer/">trailer</a> for this sequel makes it look a lot darker, grungier, and intense and it's certainly captured my attention.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">City of Ember</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 10th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1481493/">Gil Kenan</a> (<em>Monster House</em>)<br />

The early reviews have been all positive, and a new classic could be in the making.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/">David Fincher</a> (<em>Se7en</em>, <em>Fight Club</em>, <em>Zodiac</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who starts aging backwards with bizarre consequences.<br />

<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Batman returns in the sequel to Christopher Nolan's 2005 revamp, and he's back fighting the Joker. This is already on its way to becoming the best movie of 2008 (or at least the biggest money-maker) from the early marketing alone. And the <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/17/the-dark-knight-full-theatrical-trailer-debuts/">latest trailer</a> is an absolute hit itself.</p>

<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A remake of the 1951 classic sci-fi film about an alien visitor and his giant robot counterpart who visit Earth.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Although the response is quite negative at the moment, this could turn out pretty good if all the right elements fall into place, and that includes Keanu Reeves' performance and Scott Derrickson's directing.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Eagle Eye</h4>

<h4 style="color:#900">The Fighter</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2008<br />

<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Possibly already the big comedy hit of 2008, it's the first movie since <em>The Producers</em> in 2005 to have Mel Brooks' touch. Besides that, the <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/07/10/teaser-trailer-for-steve-carells-get-smart-released/">footage</a> already out has planted this solidly as the soon-to-be funniest spy movie of the decade.</p>

<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Remake of the 1981 David Cronenberg horror classic in which "Scanners" have great psychic power, strong enough to control minds. Doctor Paul Ruth finds a scanner that Revok hasn't, and converts him to their cause - to destroy the underground movement.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Bousman is supposedly taking on this remake of the "exploding head" 1981 classic, and I'm insanely curious to see how he'll revamp it.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Semi-Pro</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> February 29th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0022768/">Kent Alterman</a><br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson, André Benjamin, Will Arnett<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Jackie Moon, the owner-coach-player of the American Basketball Association's Flint Michigan Tropics, rallies his teammates to make their NBA dreams come true.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Might be the best Will Ferrell comedy since <em>Anchorman</em>. The <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/06/will-ferrells-semi-pro-full-fro-trailer/">full trailer</a> is pretty damn hilarious - at least it will be better than <em>Blades of Glory</em> and <em>Talladega Nights</em>.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Sex and the City: The Movie</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 30th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0455078/">Michael Patrick King</a><br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Jennifer Hudson<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> The movie version of the long-running HBO series featuring the further exploits of Carrie Bradshaw, Samantha Jones, Charlotte York and Miranda Hobbes.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> This is an absolute dream come true for fans of the TV series and apparently long-time show regular Michael Patrick King has thrown in everything that he could into the story.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Son of Rambow</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 2nd, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1134029/">Garth Jennings</a> (<em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Will Poulter, Bill Milner, Jules Sitruk, Charlie Thrift<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A nostalgic trip back to the 80s, <em>Son of Rambow</em> is an inventive valentine to an era where, for the first time in history, young minds had access to technology that allowed them to create their own stories while paying homage to their larger-than-life heroes from the movies that inspired them.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> A smash Sundance 2007 hit, this is finally making its way to theaters after Stallone's <em>Rambo</em> arrives in January and it's bound to be a huge indie hit just like <em>Little Miss Sunshine</em>.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Speed Racer</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 9th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0905154/">Larry Wachowski</a> &#038; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0905152/">Andy Wachowski</a> (<em>The Matrix Trilogy</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Matthew Fox<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Based on the classic 1960's Japanese animated series chronicling the aspirations of a young race car driver as he attempts to obtain glory, with the help of his family and the Mach 5, the advanced car created by his father.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> The Wachowski's are back directing for the first time since <em>Matrix Revolutions</em> are are creatively adapting the Japanese cartoon into something we've never seen before yet looks visually stunning.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Star Trek XI</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> December 25th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/">J.J. Abrams</a> ("Lost", "Alias", <em>Mission: Impossible III</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Zachary Quinto, Chris Pine, Eric Bana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin, Zoe Saldana<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A chronicle of the early days of James T. Kirk and his fellow USS Enterprise crew members.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Probably the most talked about geek phenomenon ever, J.J. Abrams is revamping this epic franchise back into full action and turning it into a mainstream fascination.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Trailer Trash</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> August 22nd, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0744834/">Eli Roth</a> (<em>Cabin Fever</em>, <em>Hostel: Part I</em> &#038; <em>II</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Unannounced<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A series of fake trailers strung together into a feature film.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Although <em>Grindhouse</em> didn't fare too well at the box office, the film (and its fake trailers) was one of the best of the year, which is why I can't wait to see what sick madness the controversial Eli Roth has dreamt up over countless fake trailers.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Valkyrie</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 3rd, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001741/">Bryan Singer</a> (<em>The Usual Suspects</em>, <em>X-Men 2</em>, <em>Superman Returns</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Tom Cruise, Bill Nighy, Carice van Houten, Kenneth Branagh, Patrick Wilson<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Based on actual events, a plot to assassinate Hitler is unfurled during the height of WWII.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Given that it's Bryan Singer, the expectations are high and after watching the <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/11/09/debut-of-bryan-singers-valkyrie-trailer/">trailer</a>, my perception is that it could be the best WWII movie since <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Vantage Point</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> February 22nd, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871428/">Pete Travis</a><br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Dennis Quaid, William Hurt, Matthew Fox, Sigourney Weaver, Forest Whitaker<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> With a Rashomon narrative style, the attempted assassination of the president is told from five different perspectives.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> The very <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/06/08/first-trailer-for-vantage-point-with-dennis-quaid/">first trailer</a> that dropped over the summer for <em>Vantage Point</em> has since kept up the energy and excitement as well as my expectations for an early-in-the-year action-thriller hit.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Wall-E</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> June 27th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004056/">Andrew Stanton</a> (<em>A Bug's Life</em>, <em>Finding Nemo</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, Ben Burtt<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> The year is 2700. WALL•E, a robot, spends every day doing what he was made for. But soon, he will discover what he was meant for.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> I'm a sucker for sci-fi <em>and</em> I'm a sucker for Pixar. From the <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/17/must-watch-next-new-wall-e-trailer/">trailers</a>, photos, and talk so far, this could be the best Pixar movie yet.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Wanted</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> June 27th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0067457/">Timur Bekmambetov</a> (<em>Night Watch</em>, <em>Day Watch</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> James McAvoy, Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie, Common<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> A young man finds out his long lost father is an assassin. And when his father is murdered, the son is recruited into his father's old organization and trained by a man named Sloan to follow in his dad's footsteps.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> This seems unique enough from the <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/10/30/must-watch-trailer-for-wanted/">trailer</a> to be pretty damn good, also considering I love fresh new styles from Europe and comic book adaptations - and this is made up of both of those.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Where the Wild Things Are</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 3rd, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005069/">Spike Jonze</a> (<em>Being John Malkovich</em>, <em>Adaptation</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Catherine Keener, Benicio Del Toro, Forest Whitaker, Lauren Ambrose, Catherine O'Hara<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> An adaptation of Maurice Sendak's classic children's story, where Max, a mischievous little boy, creates his own world - a forest in habited by fabulous wild creatures who crown Max as their ruler.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Spike Jonze is up there with Michel Gondry (see <em>Be Kind Rewind</em> above) as being one of the most creative and unique filmmakers in the entire world. The <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/11/second-look-spike-jonzes-where-the-wild-things-are/">promo photos</a> I've seen so far and very early buzz that I've heard has lead me to believe that this is a gem in the works.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">The X-Files 2</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> July 25th, 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004810/">Chris Carter</a><br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Amanda Peet<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Unannounced<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> I'll be honest - I loved the original <em>X-Files</em> movie from 1998, despite not being a fan of the show. And now they're coming back with what could be an even better and more thrilling story.</p>
<h4 style="color:#900">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</h4>
<p style="margin-top:2px;"><strong>Release Date:</strong> Late 2008<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/">Kevin Smith</a> (<em>Dogma</em>, <em>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</em>, <em>Clerks II</em>)<br />
<strong>Starring:</strong> Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Jason Mewes<br />
<strong>Synopsis:</strong> Lifelong platonic friends Zack and Miri look to solve their respective cashflow problems by making an adult film together. As the cameras roll, however, the duo begin to sense that they may have more feelings for each other than they previously thought.<br />
<strong><span class="greencolor">The Hype:</span></strong> Kevin Smith rarely goes wrong and after <em>Clerks II</em> in 2006, I'm confident that this will be just as good, if not even better than that. He's got an amusing plot, a hilarious lead actor, and gorgeous lead actress - what more can you ask for?</p>

I just hope to God the same doesn't happen with Dark Knight.</p>

			<p class="comment-alt">I thought the "changeling" reference to Straczynski was a little snarky, listing just Babylon 5 and He-Man, the latter of which was in 1985. C'mon, he's done Twilight Zone, Murder She Wrote, Jeremiah, Nightmare Classics, there's a World War Z movie and a Silver Surfer movie and They Marched into Sunlight movie all by him&#8230;and you pick out He-Man?<br /><br />Tacky, guys, just tacky.</p>

			<p class="comment">"The Box"&#8211;I remember seeing this story on Tales from the Darkside, a television series of horror short stories, similar to The Twilight Zone. A wooden box is delivered to a down-on-their-luck couple by a creepy stranger, who tells them he will give them a pile of cash if they open the box but says someone will die if they do. This was a pretty good story for a twenty-three minute show, but I'm not sure how well this will work as an hour-long film.</p>

			<p class="comment-author">#5 Ethan - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383028/" rel="nofollow">Synecdoche, New York</a> - yes, I've heard about it, but there's nothing on it at all so I can't exactly say it will be awesome just yet. Though I may have to add it once we have some photos or news or something&#8230;<br /><br />#9 Gene - That's because Dragonball doesn't look that awesome - yet&#8230; We just posted this casting update which may start to change things:<br /><a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/19/dragonballs-cast-grows-again-with-chow-yun-fat/" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/19/dragonballs-cast-grows-again-with-chow-yun-fat/</a><br /><br />#11 Gregory - Watchmen comes out March 6th, 2009.<br /><br />#13 Dan - Narnia 2 is on there, it's under Chronicles of Narnia&#8230;<br /><br />#15 Luke - I really don't think 10,000 B.C. looks that awesome at all. It's just a big epic that looks like it'll be terrible, not anything good&#8230; Anyone else agree?</p>

Nick asks an important question&#8230; why is everyone so dumb?  Why everyone seems to like the same old stories told over and over again just changing the background scenarios.  Most of these films will be totally pants!</p>

			<p class="comment-alt">"This list sucks" <br />"Most of this will be totally crap" <br />"Most of this is gonna suck"<br /><br />    Man, some of you guys must sure hate watching movies. While I doubt ALL of these movies will be absolutely incredible, don't you all think that you might just maybe go see one of these movies in the theater and go, "Hey, that was pretty good." Or are you just happy to go to movie sites and say that movies suck? If you're going to keep consistent, maybe you should go to music sites and say that music sucks. Or maybe go to a video game site and say that video games suck. It's ENTERTAINMENT. And not everyone's taste in entertainment is equal. So right now your sophomoric arguments about this list sucking is equivalent to saying "I think the color blue sucks, if you think blue is cool, you suck." Nice job guys, nice.<br /><br />    I'd love to see one of you who posted a "This sucks" comment to give me a well thought out argument as to why I shouldn't be excited for any of these movies. Not why YOU don't give a damn about the movies, but why I'm not allowed to be hyped without being told "You suck". <br /><br />    Hassannasrallah, if this isn't what you think Cinema should be, then how about you let us know what it should be. This comment board is for discussion, not a moronic posting of thoughtless bashing.</p>

			<p class="comment-alt">@Icarus:<br /><br />Following the teachings of Nick Naylor (Thank You for Smoking), the best argument is not to give a detailed synopsis of reasons why my movie list is better than yours. The best argument is to show everyone why your list "sucks". After all having the choice of making a better list is what is ultimately the winning position. And, I like chocolate more than vanilla.<br /><br />@Alex:<br /><br />Good list. A bit long though. I think some of us would have preferred a more concise version with only your favorite items. But, all the movies you list are worth a look.<br /><br />BTW, did First Showing ever publish a year in review of the previous list. Of the 24 or so from last year's "awesome" list, which were blockbusters and which were total bombs.</p>

A mysterious stranger (Langella), delivers the message that the box promises to bestow upon its owner $1 million with the press of a button. But, pressing this button will simultaneously cause the death of another human being somewhere in the world…someone they don’t know. With just 24 hours to have the box in their possession, Norma and Arthur find themselves in the crosshairs of a startling moral dilemma and must face the true nature of their humanity. <br />*courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures*</p>

If all you are going to do is copy the plot synopsis from IMDB and then parrot the party line as laid down by the studios, then do us all a favour and find a new job, or hobby or whatever it is you're doing.<br /><br />You liked the first X-files movie but not the series?   You think the next Narnia movies will be good?   And saying you hope that something will be as good at Clerks 2 is not a good thing to say about anything.</p>

			<p class="comment">I just want to say that I think the creator of this list did a good job. If you don't agree with the list then thats fine, is it really necessary to say that they're all crap? He wasn't saying that these are going to be the only good movies of 2008, he was just giving a run down of whats to come. And the funny thing is, most of you who bashed and complained about hollywood and this list will run out and pay the insane amount of money it costs to see them in the theatres.</p>

"Dark Knight, The Other Boleyn Girl", "Choke" &amp; "Valkyrie" Except I wish they used someone else other than Tom Cruise. But some are just plain redundant. For example,  "Sex and the City" and "The Incredible Hulk" one of the most looked forward to movies of the year a bit over the top.</p>

			<p class="comment">This is a fair list which helps to provide an insight into possible movies to look out for in 2008 and helps to generatete movie conversation down the pub. <br /><br />However, the list is predominantly Americanised, centering on mainstream single braincell productions - too many franchise movies. What about more independent, original sreenplay movies that require thouht provoking directing and intense acting rather than CGI. More of these please and less of rambo 4, star trek 9, mummy 3, james bond 22, I JONES 4 etc. Becoming like a video prin for the football scores!!!!<br /><br />Do a list of original films, bet you cant!!!!!!!<br /><br />My kingdom for originality.</p>

			<p class="comment">#71 I'd be happy to see your list of original films that will be thought provoking without being boring and ineptly made. Bonus points if you list only movies that don't focus on nihilism or the despair of the common man.<br /><br />#73 RocknRolla is on the list dumbass. Why don't you keep your nationalist hatred to yourself until you actually read the damn list.</p>

			<p class="comment">I thought the list was great. Lots of movies i can't wait to see, but the comments on this board are hillarious and somewhat insightful. I too would like to see another list of more original/ independant films. althought i give you props for the independants that did make it on the list. Also to the american hater i got to say why are you reading an americana list then. i'm canadian and if i want a list of canadian movies i'd go to that website.</p>

But here is my list of movies people will probably top out at, just because of the cast behind them.<br /><br />1. Iron Man<br />2. The Dark Knight<br />3. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull<br />4. The Incredible Hulk<br />5. Mummy 3: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</p>
