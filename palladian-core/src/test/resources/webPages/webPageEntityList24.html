                    <p class="boldtextLeft">History has shown that the involvement of celebrities, be they actors, musicians, artists, sportsmen and women, politicians - people in the pubic eye - can make a vast difference to the efforts of charities and fundraising groups. Their contribution of time, effort, memorabilia or monies can spur and inspire others and helps bring a focus and attention to a cause that is 
                    often desperately needed in this media-rich era.</p>

                    <p>Actress: Being cast as uber-bitch Ashley Green on the Aaron Spelling-produced series Malibu Shores was perhaps to prove exceptionally fortuitous for Charisma, as the role preceded her being signed on as uber-bitch (who turns nice) Cordelia Chase in the highly successful and popular series Buffy, The Vampire Slayer.
