<div class="entry-bound">Guest post by Jason Cohen. In the quest for optimization, A/B tests, metrics, and funnels, we&#8217;re in danger of losing the fun and value of creative work. When we demand overwhelming customer outcry before committing to the slightest product change, we&#8217;re in danger of losing the value of creating a cool feature that takes too much effort but people just love. When we do the minimum necessary to get the job done, we&#8217;re efficient but not thrilling. We&#8217;re &#8220;lean&#8221; but we&#8217;re not stirring hearts.

Within weeks of its release it was purchased by Apple. I expect we&#8217;ll see a lot more of the team and technology behind Siri and are hearing that their technology will play key roles in future iPhones. What is Siri? It is an iPhone app that you talk to. It understands what you are saying and then its artificial intelligence engine goes to work to assist you. Ask it to reserve a table in your favorite restaurant and it will. Ask it to find movie times and it will.</div>

Regardless of the type of hosting you&#8217;re using &#8211; dedicated or cloud &#8211; it&#8217;s important to take network interface security seriously. Most often, threats from the internet are the only ones mentioned. However, if you share a private network with other customers, you have just as much risk on that interface. Many cloud providers allow you access to a private network environment where you can exchange data with other instances or other services offered by the provider.

Whrrl allows you to annotate your visit with notes, images and more to create virtual scrapbooks of your event or visit. (Think a child&#8217;s T-ball game.) When there are more Whrrl users at an event, you can tie the stories together on the location&#8217;s page and see what other users are adding to the scrapbooks.

Unlike them, I do have to get up every day and meet deadlines. But boredom has recently taken on an irritable edge and it was time to schedule some&hellip;</div>

<div class="entry-bound">I&#8217;m not a big fan of video conferencing conversations where everyone is staring at their own bad hair day in the little window on their screen and pretending to be interested in the conversation. But I did see a video phone app the other day that I think I&#8217;ll use: Knocking Live. It&#8217;s an app for iPhones or Android phones that lets you send a live video stream to your friends and family &#8212; as long as they, too, have an iPhone or Android phone. You can also send a live video link to anyone with an iPod or iPad. Pretty cool, right? Who needs an iPhone 4 for this?</div>

Simply enter a keyword (like &#8220;marketing&#8221;) and click analyze. The tool will return a list of words that were found to be related to that word and highly ReTweetable.

The idea is to make employees accountable for their comments on social media and ensure that no confidential content and details are being leaked out on public forums. As much as some organizations might want to ignore this, social media is something which is prevalent both at work and at home. And this really cannot be ignored. Many Indian companies have taken the route by banning social media sites on their network.</div>

I get these things all the time and I guess it just helps me appreciate my childhood even more. Back in the late 70s and early 80s, when I was 4-5 years old and my memories were just starting to really stick with me, we were living in the inner city of Buffalo.

As an Austinite since age 3, I&#8217;ve grown up in the shadow of the University of Texas tower. I&#8217;m also a UT graduate, and a lifelong Longhorns football fan. So when I found out that the University had licensed a 1:400 scale-model replica of the iconic tower as a container for a bottled water product, I was &#8220;hooked&#8221; instantly.

The reason being that the image search was superior to Google&#39;s. Bing&#39;s image search, in addition to providing different - in this case, better - results, innovated the page-less scrolling of results. The model of attracting people via a key feature, which beats the competition, then encouraging them to stay for all the other features is, naturally, what the fight for users is all about.</div>

You have three choices: Boil the ocean Take other people&#8217;s water Go where the water is Boil the ocean is what the big guys do.

It evaporates from the ground. The tiniest little drops of water in the air float around and by chance bump into each other. Every time they do, they get a little bigger, eventually forming clouds.

The biggest of these, he says, were a surplus of easy money and the lack of a hacker culture, and Graham argues that both were a result of Yahoo thinking of itself as a media company instead of a technology company.

Sure, it may only be ten minutes, or even two, but multiply that by dozens, or even hundreds, of people, and pretty soon you're buried in a stack of email, voice mail, Twitter DMs, Facebook messages, and so on, most of which will take some time to reply to, and some of them maybe never. That can be frustrating enough by itself - you want to help everyone and reply to every email in a timely fashion, but it's simply not possible, or at least not practical.</div>

Did members join to give product feedback, buy more or get you mentioned on blogs? No. They joined to meet others like them and have a good time.

It is no surprise everyone is panicking about social networking and online gaming but it is fascinating that online games have overtaken email as the second most heavily used sector accounting for 10% of all online time versus 8.3% for email.&nbsp;The question is are you worried about the "Other" category and do you even know what it is?

There are now 190 million Twitter users around the world producing 65 million tweets each day. 19% of US internet users now say they use Twitter or a similar service to share updates about themselves—double the figure from the previous year (Pew, 2009). So who tweets? Why? What are they talking about? And what is so engaging about all those little textual transmissions?

The art and science of persuasion is often discussed as though changing people's minds is about using the right arguments, the right tone of voice or the right negotiation tactic. But effective influence and persuasion isn't just about patter, body language or other techniques, it's also about understanding people's motivations.

<div class="entry-bound">These days most people are happy to carry a lot of processing power in their pocket &#8211; in their phones &#8211; and use it to connect with each other and with retail brands. Companies have a lot of information about the products people want, both their own data and that provided by their customers, such as reviews and comments. It makes sense to link the two. I recently invited Neil Jones, head of marketing for eMobileScan, who are leading barcode scanner and data capture specialists, to write about a possible near-future for retailers.

<div class="entry-bound">A while back (Part 18, to be precise) I wrote about the need for corporate investor relations sites to speak about strategy. The basic premise of the piece was that when buying a stock, investors are purchasing a claim on the future cash flows of the company and therefore need visibility into the future plans of the company. Many companies are reluctant to discuss strategy on their investor web sites, however, so when I came across a great example of a strategy discussion, I thought it would be an opportune time to revisit the topic.

Your target audience is the only one who can take action by forwarding it to friends, talking about it with co-workers, etc. That said, I wanted to share an e-blast that was sent to me recently from juice giant, Jamba Juice.

It feels as if ideas are being liberated and experimentation is the order of the day.

<div class="entry-bound">A few weeks back I wrote the blog post 'Planning a Content Strategy' for which I received some great feedback, since then I've given some more thought to this subject and spent some time trying to get a sense of how brands view of 'content' is changing. I think we are starting to see brands recognising that a more strategic approach to content is becoming increasingly important. It's moving from being one of the last considerations of a web dev project and is taking centre stage of the digital strategy.

He explores how our online connections differ from our offline ones, how we identify friends (as opposed to connections), who we are truly able to keep tabs on, and how all of these things collide in the online space. He argues that targeting people based on perceived influence ignores that we are most connected with roughly 3-10 people who we truly trust.

This man is better known for the product he perfected, but really became rich because of the network he built across the world.

This question, as you may have already guessed, matters most if you want to become rich. (I still love Pooh Bear and especially Eeyore, don&#8217;t you?) There is some excellent guidance on this subject as Robert Kiyosaki&#8217;s Asset #3 that you gain from your involvement in network marketing.

<div class="entry-bound">A retweet on Twitter is a simple, but powerful ways to take your content that you&#8217;re sharing with current followers and potentially making it viral. When someone retweets (RT) what you&#8217;ve posted the message goes beyond your personal follower pool. It&#8217;s instantly sent to other new tweeters, which exponentially increases awareness about your brand through your tweet. Similar to other social media phenomenon, a RT is more coveted than achieved, but by following some of the suggestions below you can finesse your tweets to make them retweet-worthy in no time. 1.

<div class="entry-bound">As powerful as social media is perceived to be there&#8217;s still quite a bit of mystery that surrounds it. Brands recognize that they need to be involved, but they&#8217;re struggling with assigning a dollar-value on social media exposure and how it equates to revenue. Because there aren&#8217;t any tools or systems in place that can spit out data on a company&#8217;s return on investment (ROI) for increasing its Twitter followers many businesses find themselves wondering if they&#8217;re just spinning their profit wheels in a social media mudslide.

With Facebook&#8217;s recent announcement that it&#8217;s hit 500 million users and Twitter&#8217;s move toward advertising with @earlybird it&#8217;s becoming more apparent that if you want to get the word out about your business you need to step into the social media arena.

The word on the cyber-street about the campaign had been highly negative for weeks, but it seemed like D’Amico either wasn’t listening to the feedback or – more distressingly – didn’t care. Well, my post seemed to have struck a nerve and I received a lot of feedback on it, from people who agreed with my assessment, those who thought I was an overacting blowhard, and even D’Amico themselves. D’Amico heard us … Recently D’Amico&hellip;</div>

According to a study by Alexander Wissner-Gross, PhD, physicist at Harvard University and environmental activist, an average website causes about 0.02g (0,0008oz.) of carbon dioxide for each visit. Assuming an average blog gets 15,000 visits a month, it has yearly carbon dioxide emissions of 3,6kg (8lb.). This can mainly be tracked back to the immense energy usage from (mainframe) computers, servers, and their cooling systems. How does a tree neutralize your blog’s carbon footprint?
