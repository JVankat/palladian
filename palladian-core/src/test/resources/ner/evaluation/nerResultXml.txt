<COUNTRY>Ireland</COUNTRY>’s outlying islands

Ireland’s indented, craggy coast has more than 300 outlying islands, 30 of which are inhabited. <UNIT>Close</UNIT> in distance yet distinctly quieter than the mainland, these bastions of traditional life are places to breathe in the untainted sea air and soak up the spectacular scenery, and many offer a unique window into the country’s rich cultural and spiritual heritage.  

<LANDMARK>Tiny Heir Island</LANDMARK> -- one of the many isles that are scattered across <UNIT>County Cork</UNIT>’s Roaring Water Bay in <COUNTRY>Ireland</COUNTRY>’s southwest -- is one of the country’s go-to gourmet spots. So you will need to book months in advance to dine at <COUNTRY>Island</COUNTRY> Cottage, a restaurant run by the husband-and-wife team John Desmond and Ellmary Fenton. Reached by a four-minute ferry ride from <LANDMARK>Cunnamore Pier</LANDMARK> on the mainland <POI>near Skibbereen</POI>, the quaint, whitewashed building is one of the many traditional-style cottages that still outnumber the bungalows blighting much of the <COUNTRY>Irish</COUNTRY> countryside.

<CITY>Desmond</CITY>, who also worked in the kitchen of the celebrated <POI>Ritz</POI> Hotel in <CITY>Paris</CITY>, crafts a simple menu that changes daily and is dictated by local seasonal produce. For example, locally caught, herb marinated salmon could be followed a duck leg with béarnaise sauce and gratin dauphinois. The couple also runs one-on-one cookery courses at <COUNTRY>Island</COUNTRY> Cottage throughout the year.

This June saw the opening of a second cookery school on the island, <POI>The Firehouse</POI>, which specialises in bread making and was set up by Heir <COUNTRY>Island</COUNTRY> native, Patrick Ryan, co-author of the book Bread Revolution. During the one-day courses, students learn the art of making cinnamon swirls, soda bread and pizza -- all cooked in a wood fired oven. Students also get a bag of baked goods to take home.
