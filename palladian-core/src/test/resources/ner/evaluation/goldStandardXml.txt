<COUNTRY>Ireland</COUNTRY>’s outlying islands

<COUNTRY>Ireland</COUNTRY>’s indented, craggy coast has more than 300 outlying islands, 30 of which are inhabited. Close in distance yet distinctly quieter than the mainland, these bastions of traditional life are places to breathe in the untainted sea air and soak up the spectacular scenery, and many offer a unique window into the country’s rich cultural and spiritual heritage.  

Tiny <LANDMARK>Heir Island</LANDMARK> -- one of the many isles that are scattered across <UNIT>County Cork</UNIT>’s <LANDMARK>Roaring Water Bay</LANDMARK> in <COUNTRY>Ireland</COUNTRY>’s southwest -- is one of the country’s go-to gourmet spots. So you will need to book months in advance to dine at <POI>Island Cottage</POI>, a restaurant run by the husband-and-wife team John Desmond and Ellmary Fenton. Reached by a four-minute ferry ride from <POI>Cunnamore Pier</POI> on the mainland near <CITY>Skibbereen</CITY>, the quaint, whitewashed building is one of the many traditional-style cottages that still outnumber the bungalows blighting much of the Irish countryside.

Desmond, who also worked in the kitchen of the celebrated <POI>Ritz Hotel</POI> in <CITY>Paris</CITY>, crafts a simple menu that changes daily and is dictated by local seasonal produce. For example, locally caught, herb marinated salmon could be followed a duck leg with béarnaise sauce and gratin dauphinois. The couple also runs one-on-one cookery courses at <POI>Island Cottage</POI> throughout the year.

This June saw the opening of a second cookery school on the island, <POI>The Firehouse</POI>, which specialises in bread making and was set up by <LANDMARK>Heir Island</LANDMARK> native, Patrick Ryan, co-author of the book Bread Revolution. During the one-day courses, students learn the art of making cinnamon swirls, soda bread and pizza -- all cooked in a wood fired oven. Students also get a bag of baked goods to take home.
