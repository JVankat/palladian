'''Dresden''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdʁeːsdᵊn}}; {{lang-hsb|Drježdźany}}) is the capital city<ref>Designated by article 2 of the [http://web.archive.org/web/20080131113213/http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/de/infothek/volksvertretung/popup_verfassung.html Saxon Constitution]</ref> of the [[Free State of Saxony]] in [[Germany]]. It is situated in a valley on the River [[Elbe]], near the [[Czech republic|Czech border]]. The Dresden [[conurbation]] is part of the [[Saxon triangle|Saxon Triangle]] metropolitan area with 2.4 million inhabitants.<ref>Region Sachsendreieck: [http://www.region-sachsendreieck.de/mrs/de/top/karte/ Map of the Sachsendreieck (Saxon triangle)]</ref> Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the [[Prince-Elector|Electors]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Kings of Saxony]], who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendour. 
The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its [[baroque]] and [[rococo]] city center. A controversial [[bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allied aerial bombing]] towards the end of World War II killed 25,000 civilians and destroyed the entire city center. The impact of the bombing and 40 years of urban development during the [[East Germany|East German]] communist era have considerably changed the face of the city. Some restoration work has helped to reconstruct parts of the historic inner city, including the [[Katholische Hofkirche]], the [[Semper Oper]] and the [[Dresdner Frauenkirche]]. Since [[German reunification]] in 1990, Dresden has regained importance as one of the cultural, educational, political and economic centers of Germany and Europe.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Dresden history}}
Although Dresden is a relatively recent city of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] origin,<ref name="Dresden.de">''Dresden.de''. [http://www.dresden.de/en/02/07/01/c_01.php "Prehistoric times"]. Retrieved 24 April 2007.</ref> the area had been settled in the [[Neolithic]] era by [[Linear Pottery culture]] tribes ca. [[8th millennium BC|7500 BC]].<ref>Rengert Elburg: [http://www.academia.edu/1160390/Man-animal_relationships_in_the_Early_Neolithic_of_Dresden_Saxony_Germany_ Man-animal relationships in the Early Neolithic of Dresden (Saxony, Germany)]</ref> Dresden's founding and early growth is associated with the [[Ostsiedlung|eastward expansion of Germanic peoples]],<ref name="Dresden.de"/> mining in the nearby [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]], and the establishment of the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Its name etymologically derives from Old Sorbian ''Drežďany'', meaning ''people of the forest''. Dresden later evolved into the capital of [[Saxony]].

===Early history===

[[File:Cortège des Princes.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Fürstenzug]]—the Saxon sovereigns depicted in [[Meissen porcelain]]]]
Around the late 12th century, a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlement called ''Drežďany''<ref name="Löffler">Fritz Löffler, ''Das alte Dresden'', Leipzig 1982, p.20</ref> had developed on the southern bank. Another settlement existed on the northern bank, but its Slavic name is unclear. It was known as ''Antiqua Dresdin'' verifiable since 1350 and later as Altendresden,<ref name="Löffler"/><ref>[http://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/infoblaetter/historie_altendresden.pdf?PHPSESSID=3b1a560f5b42d55b28790331bf486b97 Geschichtlicher Hintergrund des Jubiläums "600 Jahre Stadtrecht Altendresden" (German)]</ref> both literally "old Dresden". [[Dietrich, Margrave of Meissen]], chose Dresden as his interim residence in 1206, as documented in a record calling the place "Civitas Dresdene".

After 1270, Dresden became the capital of the margravate. It was restored to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] dynasty in about 1319. From 1485, it was the seat of the [[duke]]s of Saxony, and from 1547 the [[Prince-elector|electors]] as well.

===Modern age===
The [[Rulers of Saxony|Elector]] and ruler of Saxony Frederick [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony|Augustus I]] became King [[Augustus II of Poland|August the Strong]] of [[Poland]] in [[personal union]]. He gathered many of the best musicians,<ref>[http://earlymusicworld.com/id16.html Dresden in the Time of Zelenka and Hasse]</ref> architects and painters from all over Europe to Dresden. His reign marked the beginning of Dresden's emergence as a leading European city for technology and art. Dresden suffered heavy destruction in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), following its capture by Prussian forces, its subsequent re-capture, and a failed [[Siege of Dresden|Prussian siege]] in 1760. [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote his [[Ode to Joy]] (the literary base of the [[European anthem]]) for the Dresden [[Masonic Lodge]] in 1785. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The city of Dresden had a distinctive silhouette, captured in famous paintings by [[Bernardo Bellotto]] and by Norwegian painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]].

Between 1806 and 1918 the city was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (which was a part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871). During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the [[Napoleon|French emperor]] made it a [[Headquarters|base of operations]], winning there the famous [[Battle of Dresden]] on 27 August 1813. Dresden was a center of the [[German Revolution]]s in 1848 with the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May Uprising]], which cost human lives and damaged the historic town of Dresden. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

During the 19th century the city became a major center of economy, including [[Automobile|motor car]] production, food processing, banking and the manufacture of [[medical equipment]]. 

In the early 20th century Dresden was particularly well known for its camera works and its cigarette factories. Between 1918 and 1934 Dresden was capital of the first Free State of Saxony. Dresden was a center of European [[modern art]] until 1933.

====Military history====
[[File:Dresden photochrom2.jpg|thumb|250px|Image of Dresden during the 1890s, before extensive World War II destruction. Landmarks include [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], [[Augustus Bridge]], and [[Katholische Hofkirche]].]]

During the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, a large military facility called Albertstadt was built.<ref>Rüdiger Nern, Erich Sachße, Bert Wawrzinek. ''Die Dresdner Albertstadt''. Dresden, 1994; ''Albertstadt&nbsp;– sämtliche Militärbauten in Dresden''. Dresden, 1880</ref> It had a capacity of up to 20,000 [[Soldier|military personnel]] at the beginning of the First World War. The garrison saw only limited use between 1918 and 1934, but was then reactivated in preparation for the Second World War.

Its usefulness was limited by attacks on 17 April 1945<ref name="USAFHSO_Analysis">[[United States Air Force|Air Force Historical Studies Office]]: [http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE 14–15 FEBRUARY 1945 BOMBINGS OF DRESDEN] including a list of all bombings</ref> on the railway network (especially towards Bohemia).<ref>Bergander, Götz. ''Dresden im Luftkrieg'': Vorgeschichte-Zerstörung-Folgen, p. 251 ff. Verlag Böhlau 1994, ISBN 3-412-10193-1</ref> Soldiers had been deployed as late as March 1945 in the Albertstadt garrison. 

The Albertstadt garrison became the headquarters of the [[Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army]] in the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]] after the war. Apart from the [[German Army|German army]] officers' school (''Offizierschule des Heeres''), there have been no more [[military unit]]s in Dresden since the army merger during German reunification, and the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1992. Nowadays, the Bundeswehr operates the [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr|Military History Museum]] of the Federal Republic of Germany in the former Albertstadt garrison.

[[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|German Federal Minister of Defense]] [[Thomas de Maizière]] has his place of residence and political basis in Dresden.

===Second World War===

{{Main|Bombing of Dresden in World War II}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0309-310, Zerstörtes Dresden.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dresden, 1945—over ninety percent of the city center was destroyed.]]

Dresden in the 20th century was a major communications hub and manufacturing center, as well as a leading European center of art, classical music, culture and science until its complete destruction on 13 February 1945. Being the capital of the German state of [[Saxony]], Dresden had not only garrisons but a whole ''military borough'', the ''Albertstadt''. This military complex, named after [[Saxon]] King Albert, was not specifically targeted in the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] though was within the expected area of destruction.

During the final months of World War II, Dresden became a haven to some 600,000 refugees, with a total population of {{Nowrap|1.2 million}}. Dresden was attacked seven times between 1944 and 1945, and was occupied by the [[Red Army]] after German capitulation.

The [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) between 13 and 15 February 1945 remains a controversial Allied action of the Western European [[theatre (warfare)|theatre of war]]. 

The inner city of Dresden was largely destroyed by 722 RAF and 527 USAAF bombers that dropped 2431 tons of high explosive bombs, and 1475.9 tons of incendiaries.<ref>On the night of the 13th/14th RAF Bomber command dispatched 796 Lancasters and 9 Mosquitos in two raids as part of Operation Thunderclap dropping "1,478 tons of high explosive and 1,182 tons of incendiary bombs" ([http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb45.html RAF Bomber Command 60th Anniversary – Campaign Diary February 1945])</ref> The high explosive bombs damaged buildings and exposed their wooden structures, while the incendiaries ignited them, severely reducing the number of shelters available to the retreating German troops and refugees. The bombing raid on Dresden destroyed almost all of the ancient center of the city<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_3549000/3549905.stm |title=BBC On This Day &#124; 14 &#124; 1945: Thousands of bombs destroy Dresden |publisher=BBC News |date= 14 February 1945|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> in three waves of attacks. Widely quoted Nazi propaganda reports claimed 200,000 deaths.  The German [[Dresden Historians' Commission]], in an official 2010 report published after five years of research concluded there were up to 25,000 casualties, while right-wing groups continue to claim that up to 500,000 people died.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8574157.stm BBC: Up to 25,000 died in Dresden's WWII bombing&nbsp;– report, 18 March 2010]</ref> 
The inhabited city center was almost wiped out, while larger residential, industrial and military sites on the outskirts were relatively unscathed. The Allies described the operation as the legitimate bombing of a military and industrial target.<ref name="USAFHSO_Analysis">[[United States Air Force|Air Force Historical Studies Office]]: [http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm Historical Analysis of the 14–15 February 1945 Bombings Of Dresden]{{Dead link|date=October 2011}} including a list of all bombings</ref> A report from the [[RAF Bomber Command|British Bomber Command]] stated the military target was the railway marshaling yard Dresden-Friedrichstadt. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] later distanced himself from the attack, even though he was heavily involved with the planning of the raid. Several researchers have argued that the February attacks were [[Proportionality (law)#International law|disproportionate]]. Mostly women and children died.<ref>Addison, Paul and Crang, Jeremy A. (eds.). Firestorm: The Bombing of Dresden. Pimlico, 2006. ISBN 1-84413-928-X. Chapter 9 p.194</ref>

American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' is based on his first hand experience of the raid as a [[POW]]. In remembrance of the victims, the anniversaries of the bombing of Dresden are marked with peace demonstrations, devotions and marches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4030017,00.html?maca=en-DKpartner_yg_infomix_en-2315-xml-mrss |title=On Dresden Anniversary, Massive Protest Against Neo-Nazi March &#124; Germany &#124; Deutsche Welle &#124; 14.02.2009 |publisher=Dw-world.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geh-denken.de/joomla/ |title=Geh Denken&nbsp;– Startseite |publisher=Geh-denken.de |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

===Post-war period===
After the Second World War, Dresden became a major industrial center in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (former East Germany) with a great deal of research infrastructure. Many important historic buildings were rebuilt, including the [[Semper Opera House]], the [[Zwinger]] Palace and a great many other historic  buildings, although the city leaders chose to reconstruct large areas of the city in a "socialist modern" style, partly for economic reasons, but also to break away from the city's past as the royal capital of Saxony and a stronghold of the German bourgeoisie. However, some of the bombed-out ruins of churches, royal buildings and palaces, such as the Gothic [[Sophienkirche]], the [[Alberttheater]] and the [[Wackerbarth-Palais]] were razed by the Soviet and East German authorities in the 1950s and 1960s instead of being repaired. Compared to [[West Germany]], the majority of historic buildings were saved{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

From 1985 to 1990, the KGB stationed [[Vladimir Putin]], the future [[President of the Russian Federation|President of Russia]], in Dresden. On 3 October 1989 (the so-called "battle of Dresden"), a convoy of trains carrying East German refugees from [[Prague]] passed through Dresden on its way to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. Local activists and residents joined in the growing [[civil disobedience]] movement spreading across the German Democratic Republic by staging demonstrations and demanding the removal of the nondemocratic government.

===Post-reunification===
[[File:Sonnedd.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], a few years after its reconsecration]]

Dresden has experienced dramatic changes since the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s. The city still bears many wounds from the [[Strategic bombing|bombing raids]] of 1945, but it has undergone significant reconstruction in recent decades. Restoration of the [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] was completed in 2005, a year before Dresden's 800th anniversary, notably by privately raised funds. The gold cross on the top of the church was paid for and donated by the City of [[Edinburgh]] as a mark of the bond between the two cities. The [[urban renewal]] process, which includes the reconstruction of the area around the [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt square]] on which the Frauenkirche is situated, will continue for many decades, but public and government interest remains high, and there are numerous large projects underway—both historic reconstructions and modern plans—that will continue the city's recent architectural renaissance.

Dresden remains a major cultural center of historical memory, owing to the city's destruction in World War II. Each year on February 13, the anniversary of the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|British and American fire-bombing raid]] that destroyed most of the city, tens of thousands of demonstrators gather to commemorate the event. Since reunification, the ceremony has taken on a more neutral and pacifist tone (after being used more politically in [[Cold War]] times). In recent years, however, [[white power skinhead]]s have tried to use the event for their own political ends. In the last ten year Dresden was host to some of the largest [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] demonstrations in the post-war [[history of Germany]]. Each year around the anniversary of the [[Dresden bombing|bombing of Dresden in World War II]] Neo-Nazis demonstrated to "mourn" what they call the "[[Allied]] bomb-[[holocaust]]". From 2010 on these demonstrations were prevented by [[the nazi marches and counter-mobilization in Dresden|antifascist counter-mobilizations]] who successfully blocked the annual Nazi-marches.

The completion of the reconstructed Dresden Frauenkirche in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the [[Dresden Neumarkt|Neumarkt]] area. The areas around the square have been divided into 8 "Quarters", with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings to be rebuilt either to the original structure or at least with a façade similar to the original. Quarter I and the front section of Quarters II, III, IV and V(II) have since been completed, with Quarter VIII currently under construction.

In 2002, torrential rains caused the [[Elbe]] to flood {{convert|9|m}} above its normal height, i.e. even higher than the old record height from 1845, damaging many landmarks (See [[2002 European flood]]). The destruction from this "millennium flood" is no longer visible, due to the speed of reconstruction.

The United Nations' cultural organization [[UNESCO]] declared the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] to be a World Heritage Site in 2004.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1156 Dresden Elbe Valley], UNESCO World Heritage Register.

The [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] was an internationally recognized site of cultural significance by the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Committee]] for five years. After being placed on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger|list of endangered World Heritage Sites]] in 2006, the city had its status as world heritage site formally removed in June 2009, for the willful breach of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, due to the construction of a highway bridge across the valley within 2&nbsp;km of the historic center. It thereby became the first location ever in Europe to lose this status, and the second ever in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/25/dresden-bridge-unesco-heritage-status |title=Bridge takes Dresden off Unesco world heritage list &#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 25 June 2009|accessdate=2009-11-01 | location=London | first=Kate | last=Connolly}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography and urban development of Dresden}}

===Location===
[[File:2011-08-28 Basteibrücke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saxon Switzerland]] a few kilometers outside of Dresden]]
Dresden lies on both banks of the [[Elbe River]], mostly in the [[Dresden Basin]], with the further reaches of the eastern [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]] to the south, the steep slope of the [[Lusatia]]n granitic crust to the north, and the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] to the east at an altitude of about {{convert|113|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Triebenberg is the highest point in Dresden at {{convert|384|m|ft|abbr=off}}.<ref name="basicGeoData">Dresden.de: [http://www.dresden.de/en/02/06/c_01.php Location, area, geographical data]</ref>

With a pleasant location and a mild climate on the Elbe, as well as Baroque-style architecture and numerous world-renowned museums and art collections, Dresden has been called "Elbflorenz" ([[Florence]] of the Elbe).
The incorporation of neighbouring [[Types of rural communities|rural communities]] over the past 60 years has made Dresden the fourth largest [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] by area in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, and [[Cologne]].<ref name="cityList">[[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants]]</ref>

The nearest German cities are [[Chemnitz]] {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the southwest, [[Leipzig]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the northwest and Berlin {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north. [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] is about {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the south and to the east {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=off}} is the [[List of cities in Poland|Polish city]] of [[Breslau]]/ [[Wrocław]].

===Nature===
Dresden is one of the greenest cities in all of Europe, with 63% of the city being green areas and forests. The [[Dresden Heath]] (''Dresdner Heide'') to the north is a forest 50&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in size. There are four [[nature reserve]]s.  The additional Special Conservation Areas cover 18&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.  The protected gardens, parkways, parks and old graveyards host 110 natural monuments in the city.<ref>Dresden: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080204222646/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=6943 Dresden—a Green city]</ref>  The [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] is a former world heritage site which is focused on the conservation of the [[cultural landscape]] in Dresden.  One important part of that landscape is the Elbe meadows, which cross the city in a 20 kilometre swath. [[Saxon Switzerland]] is an important nearby location.

===Climate===
Dresden has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Dfb]]), with hotter summers and colder winters than the German average.  The average temperature in February is {{convert|-1.7|°C|2|abbr=on}} and in July {{convert|18.1|°C|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>[[German Weather Service|Deutscher Wetterdienst]]: [http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/online/nat/index_mittelwerte.htm ''Average of the period from 1961 to 1990'']</ref>  The inner city temperature is {{convert|10.2|°C|1|abbr=on}} averaged over the year.  The driest months are February and March, with precipitation of {{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The wettest months are July and August, with {{convert|61|mm|1|abbr=on}} per month.

The microclimate in the [[Elbe valley]] differs from that on the slopes and in the higher areas. [[Klotzsche]], at 227 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], hosts the Dresden [[weather station]]. The weather in Klotzsche is 1 to {{convert|1|to|3|C-change|F-change|1|abbr=on}} colder than in the [[inner city]].

===Flood protection===
Because of its location on the banks of the Elbe, into which some water sources from the Ore Mountains flow, flood protection is important. Large areas are kept free of buildings to provide a flood plain. Two additional trenches, about 50 metres wide, have been built to keep the inner city free of water from the Elbe, by dissipating the water downstream through the inner city's gorge portion. Flood regulation systems like [[detention basin]]s and [[water reservoir]]s are almost all outside the [[Urban area|city area]].

The [[Weißeritz]], normally a rather small river, suddenly ran directly into the main station of Dresden during the [[2002 European floods]]. This was largely because the river returned to its former route; it had been diverted so that a railway could run along the river bed.

Many locations and areas need to be protected by walls and sheet pilings during floods. A number of districts become waterlogged if the Elbe overflows across some of its former floodplains.

===City structuring===
[[File:Luftbildaufnahme des Großen Gartens in Dresden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Großer Garten]] in Dresden]]
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Dresden is a spacious city. Its districts differ in their structure and appearance. Many parts still contain an old village core, while some quarters are almost completely preserved as rural settings. Other characteristic kinds of urban areas are the historic outskirts of the city, and the former suburbs with scattered housing. During the German Democratic Republic, many apartment blocks were built. The original parts of the city are almost all in the districts of Altstadt (Old town) and Neustadt (New town). Growing outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]], the historic outskirts were built in the 18th century. They were planned and constructed on the orders of the Saxon monarchs, which is why the outskirts are often named after sovereigns. From the 19th century the city grew by incorporating other districts. Dresden has been divided into ten districts called "Ortsamtsbereich" and nine former boroughs ("Ortschaften") which have been incorporated.

===Demography===
The population of Dresden reached 100,000 inhabitants in 1852, making it the third German city to reach that number.<ref name="cityList"/> The population peaked at 649,252 in 1933, but dropped to 450,000 in 1946 as the result of World War II, during which large residential areas of the city were destroyed. After large incorporations and city restoration, the population grew to 522,532 again between 1950 and 1983.<ref name="demogr1">Dresden: [http://dresden.de/de/02/06/c_020_Einwohnerzahl.php Einwohnerzahl]</ref>

Since [[German reunification]], demographic development has been very unsteady. The city has had to struggle with migration and suburbanization. The population increased to 480,000 as a consequence of several incorporations during the 1990s, but it fell to 452,827 in 1998. Between 2000 and 2010, the population grew quickly by more than 45,000 inhabitants (about 9.5%) due to a stabilized economy and reurbanization. Along with [[Munich]] and [[Potsdam]], Dresden is one of the ten fastest-growing cities in Germany,<ref name="cityList"/> while the population of the surrounding [[new federal states]] is still shrinking.<ref name="demogr1"/><ref>Statistical office of the Free State of Saxony: [http://www.statistik.sachsen.de/englisch/Seiten/unterseite42.htm Population and area of Saxony from 1815 on]</ref> The population of the city of Dresden is 523,058 (2010),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistik.sachsen.de/21/02_02/02_02_01_tabelle.asp |author=State Office for statistics of Saxony |title=Population of Saxon cities and communities |accessdate=2010-05-07}}</ref> the population of the Dresden agglomeration is 780,561 (2008),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Deutschland-Agglo.html|author=citypopulation.de quoting Federal Statistics Office|title=Principal Agglomerations (of Germany)|accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref> and the population of Region Dresden (which includes the neighbouring districts of [[Meißen (district)|Meißen]], [[Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge]] and the western part of the district of [[Bautzen (district)|Bautzen]]) is 1,143,197 (2007).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://region.dresden.de/region/portraet/statistik.php|author=Region Dresden|title=Statistical data of the Dresden Region|accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref> Today Dresden is one of the few German Cities which have more inhabitants than ever since World War II.

In Dresden, about 51.3% of the population is female. Foreigners account for about 4%.<ref>Dresden: [http://dresden.de/en/02/06/c_02.php Population]</ref> The mean age of the population is 43 years, which is the lowest among the urban districts in Saxony.<ref>Statistical office of the Free State of Saxony: [http://www.statistik.sachsen.de/12/pressearchiv/archiv2007/pm15907.htm Sachsen sind im Durchschnitt 45 Jahre alt&nbsp;– Dresdner am jüngsten, Hoyerswerdaer am ältesten] (german)</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|City Council of Dresden}}
Dresden is one of Germany's 16 political centers and the capital of Saxony. It has institutions of democratic local self-administration that are independent from the capital functions.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070312043329/http://www.jura.uos.de/institut/jkr/gosachse.htm Gemeindeordnung für den Freistaat Sachsen (SächsGemO), §2]</ref> Some local affairs of Dresden receive national attention.

Dresden hosted some international summits such as the [[Petersburg Dialogue]] between Russia and Germany, the European Union's [[Interior minister|Minister of the Interior]] conference and the [[G8]] labor ministers conference in recent years.

===Municipality and city council===
The [[City council|City Council]] defines the basic principles of the municipality by decrees and statutes. The council gives orders to the "Bürgermeister" ("Burgomaster" or Mayor) by voting for resolutions and thus has some executive power.<ref>Dresden.de: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080205031703/http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_04.php City Council]</ref>

Currently, there is no stable governing majority on Dresden city council.<ref>Dresden: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080205031703/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=6948 City Council]</ref>

The [[Burgomaster|Supreme Burgomaster]] is directly elected by the citizens for a term of seven years. Executive functions are normally elected indirectly in Germany. However, the Supreme Burgomaster shares numerous executive rights with the city council. He/She is the executive head of the municipality, and also the ceremonial representative of the city. The main departments of the municipality are managed by seven burgomasters.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080205031638/http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_01.php Dresden.de]</ref>

===Local affairs===
[[File:Landhaus Dresden Treppe.jpg|thumb|Architecture (like the "deconstructivist" fire escape on the baroque [[Landhaus (Dresden)|Landhaus]]) is a persistent subject of controversy in Dresden]]

Local affairs in Dresden often center around the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city and its spaces. Architecture and the design of [[public space|public places]] is a controversial subject. Discussions about the [[Waldschlößchenbrücke]], a bridge under construction across the Elbe, received international attention because of its position across the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Its construction caused the loss of World Heritage site status in 2009.<ref>[[UNESCO]]: [http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/265  World Heritage Committee threatens to remove Dresden Elbe Valley (Germany) from World Heritage List]</ref> The city held a public referendum in 2005 on whether to build the bridge, prior to UNESCO expressing doubts about the compatibility between bridge and heritage.

In 2006 Dresden sold its publicly subsidized housing organization, WOBA Dresden GmbH, to the US-based private [[investment company]] [[Fortress Investment Group]]. The city received {{Nowrap|987.1 million}} euro and paid off its remaining loans, making it the first large city in Germany to become debt-free. Opponents of the sale were concerned about Dresden's loss of control over the [[subsidized housing|subsidized housing market]].<ref>Dresden: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080204222643/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=33040 Selling of the WOBA Dresden GmbH (German)]</ref>

==International relations==

===Twin towns – sister cities===

Along with its [[town twinning|twin city]] [[Coventry]], Dresden was one of the first two cities to twin with a foreign city. Similar symbolism occurred in 1988, when Dresden twinned with the Dutch city of [[Rotterdam]]. The cities became twins after World War II in an act of reconciliation, as they had suffered incisive destructions from bombings. The [[Coventry Blitz]] and [[Rotterdam Blitz]] bombardments of the German [[Luftwaffe]] are also considered to be [[Proportionality (law)#International law|disproportional]]. Dresden has had a triangular partnership with [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Hamburg]] since 1987. Dresden has thirteen [[town twinning|twin cities]].<ref name="Dresden">{{cite web|url=http://www.dresden.de/en/02/11/c_03.php|title=''Dresden&nbsp;– Partner Cities''|publisher=[[copyright|©]] 2008 Landeshauptstadt Dresden|accessdate=2008-12-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Culture and architecture==
{{Main|Culture in Dresden}}
[[File:Dresden-Altstadt von der Marienbruecke-II.jpg|thumb|Dresden at blue hour]]
[[File:Frauenkirche silhouette.jpg|thumb|[[Dresden Frauenkirche]], symbol of Dresden]]
Dresden is seeking to regain the kind of cultural importance it held from the 19th century until the 1920s, when it was a center of art, architecture and music. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and [[Richard Wagner]] had a number of their works performed for the first time in Dresden. Other famous artists, such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Gottfried Semper]] and [[Gret Palucca]], were also active in the city. Dresden is also home to several important art collections, world-famous musical ensembles, and significant buildings from various [[architectural history|architectural periods]], many of which were rebuilt after the destruction of the Second World War.

===Entertainment===
[[File:Semperoper Dresden.jpg|thumb|The [[Semperoper]], completely rebuilt and reopened in 1985]]
[[File:Dresden-Yenidze-night.jpg|thumb|[[Yenidze]] at night]]
The Saxon State Opera descends from the opera company of the former electors and Kings of Saxony in the [[Semperoper]]. After being completely destroyed during the bombing of Dresden during the second world war, the opera's reconstruction was completed exactly 40 years later, on February 13, 1985. Its musical ensemble is the ''[[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]]'', founded in 1548.<ref>Semperoper: [http://www.semperoper.de/en/staatskapelle/history.html History of the Sächsische Staatskapelle]</ref>  The [[Staatsschauspiel Dresden|Dresden State Theatre]] runs a number of smaller theatres.  The Dresden State Operetta is the only independent [[operetta]] in Germany.<ref>[http://www.staatsoperette-dresden.de/en Staatsoperette Dresden]</ref> The ''Herkuleskeule'' ([[Hercules]] [[club (weapon)|club]]) is an important site in [[Kabarett|German-speaking political cabaret]].

There are several choirs in Dresden, the best-known of which is the [[Dresdner Kreuzchor]] (Choir of [[Christian cross|The Holy Cross]]). It is a boys' choir drawn from pupils of the [[Kreuzschule]], and was founded in the 13th century.<ref>[http://www.kreuzchor.de/english/chor.php Kreuzchor]</ref> The ''Dresdner Kapellknaben'' are not related to the ''Staatskapelle'', but to the former ''Hofkapelle'', the Catholic cathedral, since 1980.  The [[Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]] is the orchestra of the city of Dresden.

Throughout the summer, the outdoor concert series "Zwingerkonzerte und Mehr" is held in the [[Zwinger]]hof.  Performances include dance and music.<ref>{{cite web|author=steffen wollmerstaedt |url=http://www.dresden-theater.de |title=Landesbühnen Sachsen l Dresden l Theater l Rathen l Zwinger l Sachsen |publisher=Dresden-theater.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

A big event each year in June is the [[Bunte Republik Neustadt]].

===Museums, presentations and collections===
Dresden hosts the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden|''Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden'']] (Dresden State Art Collections) which, according to the institution's own statements, place it among the most important museums presently in existence. The art collections consist of twelve museums, of which the ''[[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]'' (Old Masters Gallery) and the ''[[Grünes Gewölbe]]'' (Green Vault) are the most famous.<ref>Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/museen.html Museums]</ref> Also known are ''[[Galerie Neue Meister]]'' (New Masters Gallery), ''[[Dresden Armory|Rüstkammer]]'' (Armoury) with the [[Dresden Armory#Turkish Chamber|Turkish Chamber]], and the ''[[Dresden Museum of Ethnology|Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden]]'' (Museum of Ethnology).

Other museums and collections owned by the Free State of Saxony in Dresden are:
* The ''[[German Hygiene Museum|Deutsche Hygiene-Museum]]'', founded for [[mass education]] in hygiene, health, [[human biology]] and medicine<ref>Deutsches Hygiene-Museum: [http://www.dhmd.de/neu/index.php?id=923 Deutsches Hygiene-Museum – The Museum of Man]</ref>
* The ''Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte'' (State Museum of Prehistory)<ref>[http://www.archsax.sachsen.de/lmv/content/288_DEU_Screen.htm State Museum of Prehistory]</ref>
* The ''Staatliche Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden'' (State Collection of Natural History)
* The ''Universitätssammlung Kunst + Technik'' (Collection of Art and Technology of the Dresden University of Technology)
* ''[[Dresden Transport Museum|Verkehrsmuseum Dresden]]'' (Transport Museum)
* ''Festung Dresden'' (Dresden Fortress)<ref>[http://www.festung-dresden.de/ Festung Dresden]</ref><ref>[http://www.dresdner-verein-bruehlsche-terrasse.de/seiten/frameset.htm Dresdner Verein Brühlsche Terrasse]</ref>

The [[Dresden City Museum]] is run by the city of Dresden and focused on the city's history. The ''[[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr]]'' (Military History Museum) is placed in the former garrison in the Albertstadt.

The book museum of the [[Saxon State Library]] presents the famous [[Dresden Codex]].
The [[Botanischer Garten der Technischen Universität Dresden|''Botanischer Garten Dresden'']] is a [[botanical garden]] in the ''[[Großer Garten]]'' that is maintained by the [[Dresden University of Technology]]. Also located in the ''Großer Garten'' is the [[Dresden Zoo]].

===Architecture===
Although Dresden is often said to be a Baroque city, its architecture is influenced by more than one style. Other eras of importance are the [[Renaissance]] and [[Historism]], as well as the contemporary styles of [[Modernism]] and [[Postmodernism]].

Dresden has some 13&nbsp;000 listed cultural monuments and eight districts under general preservation orders.<ref>Dresden: [http://www.dresden.de/en/05/040_Monument_preservation.php Monument preservation]</ref>

====Royal household====
[[File:Dresden-Zwinger.courtyard.04.JPG|thumb|[[Zwinger|Zwinger Palace]]]]
The royal buildings are among the most impressive buildings in Dresden. The [[Dresden Castle]] was the seat of the [[Royal Household|royal household]] from 1485. The wings of the building have been renewed, built upon and restored many times. Due to this integration of styles, the castle is made up of elements of the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Classicism|Classicist]] styles.<ref>Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/residenzschloss/geschichte.html The History of  the Royal Palace]</ref>

The [[Zwinger]] Palace is across the road from the castle. It was built on the old stronghold of the city and was converted to a center for the royal art collections and a place to hold festivals. Its gate by the moat, surmounted by a golden crown, is famous.<ref>Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/zwinger_mit_semperbau/geschichte.html History of the Zwinger and Semperbau]</ref>

Other royal buildings and ensembles:
* [[Brühl's Terrace]] was a gift to [[Heinrich, count von Brühl]], and became an ensemble of buildings above the river Elbe.
* [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] with the [[Pillnitz Castle]] and other castles

====Sacred buildings====
The [[Katholische Hofkirche|Hofkirche]] was the church of the royal household. Augustus the Strong, who desired to be [[King of Poland]], converted to Catholicism, as Polish kings had to be Catholic. At that time Dresden was strictly Protestant. Augustus the Strong ordered the building of the Hofkirche, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, to establish a sign of Roman Catholic religious importance in Dresden. The church is the cathedral "Sanctissimae Trinitatis" since 1980. The  crypt of the [[Wettin (dynasty)|Wettin Dynasty]] is located within the church.<ref>[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meissen]]: [http://www.bistum-dresden-meissen.de/32/40/43/index.php Kathedrale Ss. Trinitatis in Dresden]</ref>

In contrast to the Hofkirche, the Lutheran [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] was built almost contemporaneously by the citizens of Dresden. It is said to be the greatest cupola building in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Northern Europe. The city's historic Kreuzkirche was reconsecrated in 1388.<ref>Evangelisch-Lutherische Kreuzkirchgemeinde Dresden: [http://www.dresdner-kreuzkirche.de/index_e.html History of the Church of the Holy Cross]</ref>

There are also other churches in Dresden, for example a [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in the Südvorstadt district.

====Contemporary architecture====
[[File:Dresden-Kristallpalast-nigh.jpg|thumb|The locally controversial UFA-Palast]]
Dresden has been an important site for the development of [[contemporary architecture]] for centuries, and this trend has continued into the 20th and 21st centuries.

[[Historicism (art)|Historicist]] buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s sampled by public buildings such as the [[Sächsische Staatskanzlei|Staatskanzlei]] or the [[Dresden City Hall|City Hall]]. One of the youngest buildings of that era is the Hygiene Museum, which is designed in an impressively monumental style, but employs plain façades and simple structures. It is often attributed, wrongly, to the [[Bauhaus]] school.

Most of the present cityscape of Dresden was built after 1945, a mix of reconstructed or repaired old buildings and new buildings in the modern and postmodern styles. Important buildings erected between 1945 and 1990 are the Centrum-Warenhaus (a large [[department store]]) representing the [[international style (architecture)|international style]], the Kulturpalast, and several smaller and two bigger complexes of [[Plattenbau]] housing in [[Gorbitz]], while there is also housing dating from the era of [[Stalinist architecture]].
[[File:Dresden synagoge 03.jpg|thumb|The New Synagogue|left]]

After 1990 and German reunification, new styles emerged. Important contemporary buildings include the [[New Synagogue (Dresden)|New Synagogue]], a [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] building with few windows, the [[Transparent Factory]], the Saxon State Parliament and the New Terrace, the UFA-Kristallpalast cinema by [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]] (one of the biggest buildings of [[Deconstructivism]] in Germany), and the [[Saxon State Library]]. [[Daniel Libeskind]] and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] both modified existing buildings. Foster roofed the main railway station with translucent Teflon-coated synthetics. Libeskind changed the whole structure of the [[Bundeswehr Military History Museum]] Museum by placing a wedge through the historical arsenal building.

====Other buildings====
[[File:Goldener Reiter Dresden Germany.JPG|thumb|The golden equestrian sculpture of King/Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|August the Strong]]]]

Other buildings include important bridges crossing the [[Elbe]] river, the [[Blaues Wunder]] bridge and the [[Augustusbrücke]], which is on the site of the oldest bridge in Dresden.

There are about 300 fountains and springs, many of them in parks or squares. The wells serve only a decorative function, since there is a [[fresh water]] system in Dresden. Springs and fountains are also elements in contemporary cityspaces.

The most famous sculpture in Dresden is [[Jean-Joseph Vinache]]'s  golden [[equestrian sculpture]] of August the Strong called the ''Goldener Reiter'' (Golden Cavalier) on the Neustädter Markt square. It shows August at the beginning of the Hauptstraße (Main street) on his way to Warsaw, where he was King of Poland in personal union. Another sculpture is the memorial of [[Martin Luther]] in front of the Frauenkirche.

====Dresden-Hellerau—Germany's first garden city====
The [[garden city movement|Garden City]] of [[Hellerau]], at that time a suburb of Dresden, was founded in 1909. In 1911 [[Heinrich Tessenow]] built the Hellerau [[Festspielhaus Hellerau|Festspielhaus]] (festival theatre) and Hellerau became a center of modernism with international standing until the outbreak of World War I.

In 1950, Hellerau was incorporated into the city of Dresden. Today the Hellerau reform architecture is recognized as exemplary. In the 1990s, the garden city of Hellerau became a [[conservation area]].

====Living quarters====
Dresden's urban parts are subdivided in rather a lot of city quarters, up to around 100, among them relatively many larger villa quarters dominated by historic multiple dwelling units, especially, but not only along the river, most known are [[Blasewitz]], [[Loschwitz]] and [[Pillnitz]]. Also some Art Nouveau living quarters and two bigger quarters typical for communist architecture&nbsp;– but much renovated&nbsp;– can be found. The villa town of [[Radebeul]] joins the Dresden city tram system, which is expansive due to the lack of an underground system.

===Cinemas and cinematics===
There are several small [[movie theater|theaters]] presenting [[cult film]]s and low-budget or low-profile films chosen for their cultural value. Dresden also has a few multiplex cinemas, of which the Rundkino is the oldest.

Dresden has been a center for the production of animated films and optical [[cinematic techniques]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Sport===
[[File:Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Glücksgas Stadium]], the current home of Dynamo Dresden]]
Dresden is home to [[Dynamo Dresden]], which had a tradition in [[European Cup and Champions League history|UEFA club competitions]] up to the early 1990s. Dynamo Dresden won eight titles in the [[DDR-Oberliga]]. Currently, the club is a member of the [[2. Bundesliga]] after some seasons in the [[Bundesliga]] and [[3rd Liga 2008-09|3rd Liga]].

In the early 20th century, the city was represented by [[Dresdner SC]], who were one of Germany's most successful clubs in football. Their best performances came during World War II, when they were twice German [[German football champions|champions]], and twice [[DFB Pokal|Cup]] winners. Dresdner SC is a multisport club. While its [[football team]] plays in the sixth-tier [[Landesliga Sachsen]], its volleyball section has a team in the women's [[Bundesliga (volleyball)|Bundesliga]]. Dresden has a third [[association football|football]] [[team]] [[SC Borea Dresden]].
[[Dresdner Eislöwen|ESC Dresdner Eislöwen]] is an [[ice hockey]] club playing in the [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2nd Bundesliga]] again. [[Dresden Monarchs]] are an [[American football]] team in the [[German Football League]].

Since 1890, [[horse race]]s have taken place and the [http://www.dresdener-rennverein.de/ Dresdener Rennverein 1890 e.V.] are active and one of the big sporting events in Dresden.

Major sporting facilities in Dresden are the [[Glücksgas Stadium]], the [[Heinz-Steyer-Stadion]] and the [[EnergieVerbund Arena]] ([[ice hockey]]).

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
{{Main|Transportation in Dresden}}
[[File:NGTD12DD front.jpg|thumb|The longest trams in Dresden set a record in length]]

The [[Bundesautobahn 4]] ([[European route E40]]) crosses Dresden in the northwest from west to east. The [[Bundesautobahn 17]] leaves the A4 in a south-eastern direction. In Dresden it begins to cross the Ore Mountains towards Prague. The [[Bundesautobahn 13]] leaves from the three-point interchange "Dresden-Nord" and goes to Berlin. The A13 and the A17 are on the [[European route E55]]. Several [[Bundesstraße]] roads crossing or running through Dresden.

There are two main inter-city transit hubs in the railway network in Dresden: [[Dresden Hauptbahnhof]] and [[Dresden-Neustadt railway station]]. The most important railway lines run to Berlin, Prague, Leipzig and Chemnitz. A [[Regional rail|commuter train]] system ([[Dresden S-Bahn]]) operates on three lines alongside the long-distance routes.

[[Dresden Airport]] is the city's [[international airport]], located at the north-western outskirts of the town. Its infrastructure has been improved with new terminals and a motorway access route.

Dresden has a large tramway network operated by [[Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe]], the municipal transport company. Because the geological bedrock does not allow the building of [[Rapid transit|underground railways]], the tramway is an important form of public transport. The Transport Authority operates twelve lines on a 200&nbsp;km network.<ref>Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080128233503/http://dvb.de/untnehm/unnehm.htm Profile]</ref> Many of the new [[low floor|low-floor]] vehicles are up to 45 metres long and produced by [[Bombardier Transportation]] in [[Bautzen]]. While many of the system's lines are on [[reserved track]] (often sown with grass to avoid noise), many tracks still run on the streets, especially in the inner city.

The [[CarGoTram]] is a tram that supplies Volkswagen's [[Transparent Factory]], crossing the city. The transparent factory is located not far from the city center next to the city's largest park.<ref>Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe: [http://web.archive.org/web/20071216101751/http://www.dvb.de/untnehm/gbahn.htm CarGoTram]</ref>

The districts of Loschwitz and Weisser Hirsch are connected by the [[Dresden Funicular Railway]], which was opened on 26 October 1895.

Dresden is the capital of a German ''[[States of Germany|Land]]'' (federal state). It is home to the [[Landtag of Saxony]]<ref>[http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/start_eng.asp Sächsischer Landtag]</ref> and the ministries of the Saxon Government. The controlling [[List of constitutional courts|Constitutional Court]] of Saxony is in Leipzig. The highest Saxon court in civil and [[criminal law]], the Higher Regional Court of Saxony, has its home in Dresden.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080102044810/http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/olg/content/47.htm Oberlandesgericht Dresden]</ref>

Most of the Saxon state authorities are located in Dresden. Dresden is home to the Regional Commission of the [[Dresden (region)|Dresden Regierungsbezirk]], which is a controlling authority for the Saxon Government. It has jurisdiction over eight [[List of rural districts of Germany|rural districts]], two [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]] and the city of Dresden.

Like many cities in Germany, Dresden is also home to a local court, has a trade corporation and a Chamber of Industry and Trade and many subsidiaries of federal agencies (such as the Federal Labour Office or the [[Technisches Hilfswerk|Federal Agency for Technical Relief]]). It also hosts some subdepartments of the German Customs and the eastern Federal Waterways Directorate.

Dresden is also home to a military subdistrict command but no longer has large military units as it did in the past. Dresden is the traditional location for [[officer (armed forces)|army officer]] schooling in Germany, today carried out in the [[Offizierschule des Heeres]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Dresden}}
[[File:Luftbild AMD Dresden 2005.jpg|thumb|GLOBALFOUNDRIES Fab 1]]
[[File:Dresden Kongresszentrum 1.jpg|thumb|The International Congress Center Dresden]]

In 1990 Dresden—an important industrial center of the German Democratic Republic—had to struggle with the [[economic collapse]] of [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]] and the other export markets in Eastern Europe. The German Democratic Republic had been the richest [[eastern bloc]] country but was faced with competition from the Federal Republic of Germany after reunification. After 1990 a completely new [[legal system|law]] and currency system was introduced in the wake of the collapse of the German Democratic Republic and eastern Germany's infrastructure was largely rebuilt with funds from the Federal Republic of Germany. Dresden as a major urban center has developed much faster and more consistently than most other regions in the former German Democratic Republic, but the city still faces many social and economic problems stemming from the collapse of the former system, including high unemployment levels. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Until famous enterprises like [[Dresdner Bank]] left Dresden in the communist era to avoid [[nationalisation]], Dresden was one of the most important German cities. The period of the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] until 1990 was characterized by low economic growth in comparison to western German cities. The enterprises and production sites broke down almost completely as they entered the [[social market economy]]. Since then the economy of Dresden has been recovering.

The [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] fluctuated between 13% and 15% within the first 20 years after Germany's unification and is still relatively high.<ref>[[Bundesagentur für Arbeit]]: [http://www.pub.arbeitsamt.de/hst/services/statistik/detail/q.html Data and time series of the German labour market]</ref> Nevertheless, Dresden has developed faster than the average for Eastern Germany and has raised its [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] to 31,100 euro, equal to the GDP per capita of some poor West German communities (the average of the 50 biggest cities is around 35,000 euro).<ref>[[Great Officer of State|State Office]] for Statistics of the Free State of Saxony: [https://www.statistik.sachsen.de/12/pressearchiv/archiv2006/pm11206.htm Regional GDPs of 2004]</ref>

Thanks to the presence of public administration centers, a high density of semi-public research institutes which settle freely within Germany and a successful extension of high technology sectors through the help of public funding, the proportion of highly qualified workers is again among the highest in Germany and also in Europe-wide criteria, though - as all eastern towns in Germany - Dresden has a traditional shortage of corporate headquarters. Dresden is regularly ranked among the best ten bigger cities in Germany to live in. In May 2012 the unemployment rate reached a new low of 8.9%.

===Enterprises===
Three major sectors dominate Dresden's economy:

The [[Silicon Saxony|semiconductor industry]] was built up in 1969. Major enterprises today are [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s spin-off [[GLOBALFOUNDRIES]], [[Infineon Technologies]], [[ZMDI]] and Toppan Photomasks. Their factories attract many suppliers of material and cleanroom technology enterprises to Dresden.

The pharmaceutical sector came up at the end of the 19th century. The Sächsisches Serumwerk Dresden (Saxon Serum Plant, Dresden), owned by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], is a world leader in [[vaccine]] production. Another traditional pharmaceuticals producer is Arzneimittelwerke Dresden (Pharmaceutical Works, Dresden).

A third traditional branch is that of mechanical and [[electrical engineering]]. Major employers are the [[Volkswagen]] [[Transparent Factory]], [[EADS]] [[EADS EFW|Elbe Flugzeugwerke]] (Elbe Aircraft Works), [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[The Linde Group|Linde-KCA-Dresden]].  Tourism is another sector of the economy enjoying high revenue and many employees. There are something like hundred bigger hotels in Dresden with many of them in the upscale range.

==Media==
The media sector is not particularly strong in Dresden. Recently it sometimes benefits from the new interface with informatics so that it can gain transregional meaning beyond the semi-public science and upper culture sectors which often produce their media coverage in-house. The media in Dresden include two major newspapers of regional record: the ''[[Sächsische Zeitung]]'' (''Saxonian Newspaper'', circulation around 300,000) and the ''[[Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten]]'' (''Dresden's Latest News'', circulation around 50,000). Dresden has a broadcasting center belonging to the [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]]. The ''Dresdner Druck- und Verlagshaus'' (Dresden printing plant and publishing house) produces part of [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]'s [[print run]], among other newspapers and magazines.

==Education and science==

===Universities===
Dresden is home to a number of renowned universities, but among German cities it is a more recent location for academic education.

*The [[Dresden University of Technology]] (Technische Universität Dresden) with more than 36,000 students (2011)<ref>[[Technische Universität Dresden]]: [http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/portrait/ Profile of the TU Dresden]</ref> was founded in 1828 and is among the oldest and largest [[University of Technology|Universities of Technology]] in Germany. It is currently the university of technology in Germany with the largest number of students but also has many courses in [[social studies]], economics and other non-technical sciences. It offers 126 courses. In 2006, the TU Dresden was successful in the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]] of the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]].
* The Dresden University of Technology founded a Kids-University in 2004.
* The [[Dresden University of Applied Sciences]] (Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Dresden) was founded in 1992 and had about 5,300 students in 2005.<ref>[[University of Applied Sciences Dresden]]: [http://www.htw-dresden.de/oea/Presse/06_Imma.pdf press notice to the 2006 matriculation]</ref>
* The [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] (Hochschule für Bildende Künste Dresden) was founded in 1764 and is known for its former professors and artists such as [[George Grosz]], [[Sascha Schneider]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Bernardo Bellotto]], [[Carl-Gustav Carus]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[Gerhard Richter]].
* The [[Palucca School of Dance]] was founded by [[Gret Palucca]] in 1935 and is a major European school of [[free dance]].
* The [[Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden|Carl Maria von Weber College of Music]] was founded in 1856.

Other universities include the "Hochschule für Kirchenmusik", a school specialising in [[Christian music|church music]], the "Evangelische Hochschule für Sozialarbeit", an education institution for [[social work]]. The "Dresden International University" is a private postgraduate university, founded a few years ago in cooperation with the Dresden University of Technology.

===Research institutes===
Dresden also hosts many [[research institute]]s, some of which have gained an international standing. The domains of most importance are micro- and nanoelectronics, transport and infrastructure systems, material and photonic technology, and bio-engineering. The institutes are well connected among one other as well as with the academic education institutions.

[[Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf]] is the largest complex of research facilities in Dresden, a short distance outside the urban areas. It still focuses on [[nuclear medicine]] and physics. As part of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Association]] it is one of the German [[Big Science]] research centers.

The [[Max Planck Society]] focuses on [[research|fundamental research]]. In Dresden there are three Max Planck Institutes (MPI); the "[[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics|MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics]]", the "MPI for [[Chemical physics|Chemical Physics]] of Solids" and the "[[Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems|MPI for the Physics of Complex Systems]]"

The [[Fraunhofer Society]] hosts institutes of applied research that also offer mission-oriented research to enterprises. With eleven institutions or parts of institutes, Dresden is the largest location of the Fraunhofer Society worldwide.<ref>[[Fraunhofer Society]]: [http://www.fraunhofer.de/fhg/EN/profile/index.jsp Institutes]</ref> The Fraunhofer Society has become an important factor in location decisions and is seen as a useful part of the "knowledge infrastructure".

The [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz Community]] is a union of institutes with science covering fundamental research and applied research. In Dresden there are three Leibniz Institutes. The "Leibniz Institute of Polymer Research"<ref>[http://www.ipfdd.de/ IPF]</ref> and the "[[Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research]]"<ref>[http://www.ifw-dresden.de/ IFW]</ref> are both in the material and [[high tech|high-technology]] domain, while the "Leibniz Institute for Ecological and Regional Development" is focused on more fundamental research into urban planning. Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf was member of the Leibniz Community till end of 2010.

===Higher secondary education===

Dresden has 21 [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasien]] which prepare for a tertiary education.  Five are private. The "Sächsisches Landesgymnasium für Musik" with a focus on music is supported by the State of Saxony, rather than by the city. There are some ''Berufliche Gymnasien'' which combine [[vocational education]] and secondary education and a ''Abendgymnasium'' which prepares higher education of adults avocational.<ref>[http://www.dresden.de/en/03/03/c_01.php Official Dresden City Webpage]</ref>
