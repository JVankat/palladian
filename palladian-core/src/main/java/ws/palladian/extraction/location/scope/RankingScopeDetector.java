 * focus of this document (e.g. for an entry on a travel blow talking about various places such as Canberra, Sydney,
 * Melbourne, etc., we would expect to have Australia as main location. In contrast, to the general
 * {@link ScopeDetector}, implementations of this interface perform the scope detection by ranking potential candidates,
 * which are given as {@link LocationAnnotation}s (and extracted by a {@link LocationExtractor}).
