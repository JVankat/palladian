ActionScript 2.0 ActionScript 3.0 Comments  Compiler directives   endinitclip Removed The  endinitclip directive identifies the end of initialization code in ActionScript 2.0, but has no use in ActionScript 3.0.   include Removed See the include statement for similar functionality.   initclip Removed The  initclip directive identifies the beginning of initialization code in ActionScript 2.0, but has no use in ActionScript 3.0.   Constants  false false The value false, rather than undefined, is the default value of a Boolean object.  NaN NaN The value NaN, rather than undefined, is the default value of a Number object.  newline Removed Use the escape sequence composed of the backslash character followed by the character "n" (\n).  null null The value null, rather than undefined, is the default value of the Object and String classes.  undefined undefined The value undefined can be assigned only to untyped variables; it is not the default value of any typed object.   Global functions  asfunction flash.text.TextField dispatches event: link Replaced by the new event handling model. You now get the same functionality by using the syntax Event: instead of asfunction:. When a user clicks the link, Flash Player dispatches a TextEvent object of type TextEvent.LINK, which your code can listen for with the addEventListener() method. Any text that you decide to include is stored in the event object's text property.  call() Removed The call() function was deprecated. > Use the function statement for similar functionality.  chr() Removed Use String.fromCharCode() instead.  clearInterval() flash.utils.clearInterval() Moved to flash.utils package.  clearTimeout() flash.utils.clearTimeout() Moved to flash.utils package.  duplicateMovieClip() flash.display.MovieClip.MovieClip() Replaced by new MovieClip class constructor function.  eval() Removed There is no equivalent in ActionScript 3.0.  fscommand() flash.system.fscommand() Moved to flash.system package. Also, see flash.external.ExternalInterface class for JavaScript/ActionScript communication.  getProperty() Removed To directly access properties, use the dot (.) operator.  getTimer() flash.utils.getTimer() Moved to flash.utils package.  getURL() flash.net.navigateToURL() Replaced by the navigateToURL() function.  getVersion() flash.system.Capabilities.version Moved to Capabilities class and changed to accessor property.  gotoAndPlay() flash.display.MovieClip.gotoAndPlay() This function is no longer a global function, but is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  gotoAndStop() flash.display.MovieClip.gotoAndStop() This function is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  ifFrameLoaded() flash.display.MovieClip.framesLoaded   int() int() Resurrected from deprecated status as a conversion function for the new int data type.  length() String.length This property is no longer a global property, but it is still available as a property of the String class.  loadMovie() flash.display.Loader Use the Loader class instead.  loadMovieNum() flash.display.Loader Use the Loader class instead.  loadVariables() flash.net.URLLoader Use the URLLoader class instead.  loadVariablesNum() flash.net.URLLoader Use the URLLoader class instead.  mbchr() String.fromCharCode() Removed. Use the static String.fromCharCode() method instead.  mblength() String.length Removed. Use String.length instead.  mbord() String.charCodeAt() Removed. Use String.charCodeAt() instead.  mbsubstring() String.substr() Removed. Use String.substr() instead.  nextFrame() flash.display.MovieClip.nextFrame() This function is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  nextScene() flash.display.MovieClip.nextScene() This function is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  on() flash.events.EventDispatcher Removed. Use the new event handling system in the flash.events package instead.  onClipEvent() flash.events.EventDispatcher Removed. Use the new event handling system in the flash.events package instead.  ord() String Removed. Use String class methods instead.  parseInt() parseInt() A string with a leading 0 is interpreted as decimal rather than octal. For octal numbers, pass the number 8 for the radix parameter.  play() flash.display.MovieClip.play() This function is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  prevFrame() flash.display.MovieClip.prevFrame() This function is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  prevScene() flash.display.MovieClip.prevScene() This function is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  print() flash.printing.PrintJob Removed. Use the PrintJob class instead.  printAsBitmap() flash.printing.PrintJob Removed. Use the PrintJob class instead.  printAsBitmapNum() flash.printing.PrintJob Removed. Use the PrintJob class instead.  printNum() flash.printing.PrintJob Removed. Use the PrintJob class instead.  random() Math.random() Removed. Use Math.random() instead.  removeMovieClip() Removed Set all references to a movie clip to null to make the movie clip eligible for garbage collection.  setInterval() flash.utils.setInterval() Moved to flash.utils package. Consider using the Timer class instead.  setProperty() Removed To set the value of a writable property, use the dot (.) operator.  setTimeout() flash.utils.setTimeout() Moved to flash.utils package.  showRedrawRegions() flash.profiler.showRedrawRegions() Moved to flash.profiler package.  startDrag() flash.display.Sprite.startDrag() This is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the Sprite class.  stop() flash.display.MovieClip.stop() This is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the MovieClip class.  stopAllSounds() flash.media.SoundMixer.stopAll() This is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the SoundMixer class, which provides global sound control.  stopDrag() flash.display.Sprite.stopDrag() This is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the Sprite class.  substring() String.substring() This is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the String class.  targetPath() Removed ActionScript 3.0 identifies display objects directly; therefore, identifying a > display object by its path is no longer necessary.  tellTarget() Removed Use the dot (.) operator or the with statement instead.  toggleHighQuality() flash.display.Stage.quality Removed as a global property. Use the Stage class version instead.  trace() trace() The trace() method accepts a comma-delimited list of arguments.  unloadMovie() flash.display.Loader.unload() Removed. Use Loader.unload() instead.  unloadMovieNum() flash.display.Loader.unload() Removed. Use Loader.unload() instead.  updateAfterEvent() flash.events.TimerEvent.updateAfterEvent() This is no longer a global function, but it is still available as a method of the TimerEvent, MouseEvent, and KeyboardEvent classes.   Global properties  _accProps flash.accessibility.AccessibilityProperties Replaced by the AccessibilityProperties class.  _focusrect flash.display.InteractiveObject.focusRect Replaced by the focusRect property of the InteractiveObject class.  _global Removed Use a static member of a class instead.  _highquality flash.display.Stage.quality Replaced by the quality property of the Stage class.  _level Removed The concept of levels does not exist in ActionScript 3.0, which instead provides direct access to the display list. See the flash.display package for details.  maxscroll flash.text.TextField Replaced by the maxScrollH and maxScrollV properties of the TextField class.  _parent flash.display.DisplayObject.parent Replaced by the parent property of the DisplayObject class.  _quality flash.display.Stage.quality Replaced by the quality property of the Stage class.  _root flash.display.DisplayObject.stage Removed. The closest equivalent is the Stage, which serves as the root of the ActionScript 3.0 display list.  scroll flash.text.TextField Removed. Replaced by the scrollH and scrollV properties of the TextField class.  _soundbuftime flash.media.SoundMixer.bufferTime Replaced by the bufferTime property of the SoundMixer class.  this this Instance methods are bound to the instance that implemented the method; therefore, the this reference inside the body of an instance method always refers to the instance that implemented the method.   Operators  add (concatenation (strings)) Removed Use the concatenation (+) operator instead.  eq (equality (strings)) Removed Use the equality (==) operator instead.  gt (greater than (strings)) Removed Use the greater than (>) operator instead.  ge (greater than or equal to (strings)) Removed Use the greater than or equal to (>=) operator instead.  <> (inequality) Removed Use the inequality (!=) operator instead.  instanceof is Although the instanceof operator is available, it only checks the prototype chain, which is not the primary inheritance mechanism in ActionScript 3.0. Use the is operator to check whether an object is a member of a specific data type.  lt (less than (strings)) Removed Use the less than (<) operator instead.  le (less than or equal to (strings)) Removed Use the less than or equal to (<=) operator instead.  and (logical AND) Removed Use the logical AND (&&) operator instead.  not (logical NOT) Removed Use the logical NOT (!) operator instead.  or (logical OR) Removed Use the logical OR (||) operator instead.  ne (not equal (strings)) Removed Use the inequality (!=) operator instead.   Statements  delete delete The delete operator works only on properties of objects, but not on variables that hold references to objects.  import import The import statement is not optional. To use a class, you must import it, whether or not you use a fully qualified name.  intrinsic Removed ActionScript 3.0 has a similar, but not identical, keyword named native. The native keyword is similar to intrinsic in that it directs the compiler not to expect a function body, but is dissimilar in that native has no effect on compile-time type checking.  private private The ActionScript 3.0 private keyword specifies that an identifier is visible only within a class, and does not extend to subclasses. Moreover, in ActionScript 3.0 the private keyword is enforced at both compile time and run time.  set variable Removed Use the assignment (=) operator instead.  super super In ActionScript 3.0, the call to super() in a subclass constructor does not have to be the first statement in the constructor body.   Accessibility class flash.accessibility.Accessibility   isActive() Method flash.accessibility.Accessibility.active Changed from function to accessor property. Name changed from isActive to active.  updateProperties() Method flash.accessibility.Accessibility.updateProperties()    arguments class arguments   caller Property Removed You can achieve the same functionality by passing arguments.callee from the caller function as an argument to the callee function. See the Examples section of arguments.callee for an example.   Array class   CASEINSENSITIVE Constant Array.CASEINSENSITIVE Data type changed to uint.  DESCENDING Constant Array.DESCENDING Data type changed to uint.  length Property Array.length Data type changed to uint.  NUMERIC Constant Array.NUMERIC Data type changed to uint.  RETURNINDEXEDARRAY Constant Array.RETURNINDEXEDARRAY Data type changed to uint.  UNIQUESORT Constant Array.UNIQUESORT Data type changed to uint.  Array Constructor Array.Array() Parameter changed to use the ...(rest) parameter format.  push() Method Array.push() Parameter changed to use the ...(rest) parameter format.  sort() Method Array.sort() Data type of the options parameter changed to uint.  sortOn() Method Array.sortOn() Data type of the options parameter changed to uint. The ActionScript 3.0 version also has added functionality; you can now sort on more than one field name by passing an array of objects for the fieldName parameter, and each sort field can have its own matching options parameter if you also pass in a matching array of options flags for the options parameter.  splice() Method Array.splice() The parameters can have any data type, but the preferred data types are int and uint. The value parameter changed to the ...(rest) parameter format.  unshift() Method Array.unshift() The value parameter changed to the ...(rest) format. Data type of the return value changed to uint.   AsBroadcaster class flash.events.EventDispatcher   _listeners Property[read-only] flash.events.EventDispatcher.willTrigger() Not a direct equivalent. The willTrigger() method tells you whether any listeners are registered, but not how many.  addListener() Method flash.events.EventDispatcher.addEventListener() Not a direct equivalent, because the ActionScript 3.0 event model lets you add event listeners to any object in the event flow, not just to the broadcasting object.  broadcastMessage() Method flash.events.EventDispatcher.dispatchEvent() Not a direct equivalent, because the ActionScript 3.0 event model works differently. The dispatchEvent() method dispatches an event object into the event flow, while the broadcastMessage() method sends messages directly to each registered listener object.  initialize() Method Removed There is no direct equivalent in ActionScript 3.0, but similar functionality is achieved by subclassing the EventDispatcher class. For example, the DisplayObject class extends EventDispatcher, so all instances of the DisplayObject and DisplayObject subclasses are capable of sending and receiving event objects.  removeListener() Method flash.events.EventDispatcher.removeEventListener() Not a direct equivalent, because the ActionScript 3.0 event model lets you add event listeners to and remove them from any object in the event flow, not just the broadcasting object.   BitmapData class flash.display.BitmapData ActionScript 3.0 uses the BitmapDataChannel class as an enumeration of constants that indicate which channel to use.  height Property[read-only] flash.display.BitmapData.height Data type changed from Number to int.  rectangle Property[read-only] flash.display.BitmapData.rect Property renamed for consistency with other members of the API.  width Property[read-only] flash.display.BitmapData.width Data type changed from Number to int.  copyChannel() Method flash.display.BitmapData.copyChannel() The sourceChannel and destChannel parameters are now uint data types.  draw() Method flash.display.BitmapData.draw() The source parameter is now IBitmapDrawable; DisplayObject and BitmapData both implement the IBitmapDrawable interface, so you can pass either a DisplayObject or a BitmapData object to the source parameter.  fillRect() Method flash.display.BitmapData.fillRect() The color parameter is now a uint value.  floodFill() Method flash.display.BitmapData.floodFill() Now accepts int values for the x and y parameters and a uint value for color.  getColorBoundsRect() Method flash.display.BitmapData.getColorBoundsRect() Now accepts uint values for the mask and color parameters.  getPixel() Method flash.display.BitmapData.getPixel() Now accepts int parameter values and returns a uint value.  getPixel32() Method flash.display.BitmapData.getPixel32() Now accepts int parameter values and returns a uint value.  hitTest() Method flash.display.BitmapData.hitTest() Now accepts uint values for the firstAlphaThreshold and secondAlphaThreshold parameters.  loadBitmap() Method Removed This function is no longer needed because of the new bitmap support in ActionScript 3.0.  merge() Method flash.display.BitmapData.merge() Now accepts uint values for the multiplier parameters.  noise() Method flash.display.BitmapData.noise() Now accepts an int value for the randomSeed parameter and uint values for the low, high, and channelOptions parameters.  perlinNoise() Method flash.display.BitmapData.perlinNoise() Now accepts an int value for the randomSeed parameter and uint values for the numOctaves and channelOptions parameters.  pixelDissolve() Method flash.display.BitmapData.pixelDissolve() Now accepts an int value for the randomSeed and numPixels parameters and a uint value for the fillColor parameter. (The numPixels parameter is named numberOfPixels in ActionScript 2.0.)  scroll() Method flash.display.BitmapData.scroll() Now accepts int values for the x and y parameters.  setPixel() Method flash.display.BitmapData.setPixel() Now accepts int values for the x and y parameters and a uint value for color.  setPixel32() Method flash.display.BitmapData.setPixel32() Now accepts int values for the x and y parameters and a unit value for color.  threshold() Method flash.display.BitmapData.threshold() Now accepts uint values for the threshold, color, and mask parameters, and returns a uint value.   BlurFilter class   quality Property flash.filters.BlurFilter.quality The quality property data type changed from a Number to uint.   Button class flash.display.SimpleButton   _alpha Property flash.display.DisplayObject.alpha   blendMode Property flash.display.DisplayObject.blendMode   cacheAsBitmap Property flash.display.DisplayObject.cacheAsBitmap   enabled Property flash.display.SimpleButton.enabled   filters Property flash.display.DisplayObject.filters In ActionScript 3.0, the data type is Array.  _focusrect Property flash.display.InteractiveObject.focusRect   _height Property flash.display.DisplayObject.height   _highquality Property Removed See Stage.quality.  _name Property flash.display.DisplayObject.name   _parent Property flash.display.DisplayObject.parent   _quality Property Removed You can set rendering quality for all display objects by using flash.display.Stage.quality.  _rotation Property flash.display.DisplayObject.rotation   scale9Grid Property flash.display.DisplayObject.scale9Grid   _soundbuftime Property flash.media.SoundMixer.bufferTime Moved to the SoundMixer class, which is used for global sound control. Renamed without abbreviations. Removed the initial underscore from the name.  tabEnabled Property flash.display.InteractiveObject.tabEnabled   tabIndex Property flash.display.InteractiveObject.tabIndex   _target Property[read-only] Removed ActionScript 3.0 identifies display objects directly; therefore, identifying a display object by its path is no longer necessary.  trackAsMenu Property flash.display.SimpleButton.trackAsMenu   _url Property[read-only] Removed See DisplayObject.loaderInfo.url.  useHandCursor Property flash.display.SimpleButton.useHandCursor   _visible Property flash.display.DisplayObject.visible   _width Property flash.display.DisplayObject.width   _x Property flash.display.DisplayObject.x   _xmouse Property[read-only] flash.display.DisplayObject.mouseX   _xscale Property flash.display.DisplayObject.scaleX   _y Property flash.display.DisplayObject.y   _ymouse Property[read-only] flash.display.DisplayObject.mouseY   _yscale Property flash.display.DisplayObject.scaleY   getDepth() Method flash.display.DisplayObjectContainer.getChildIndex() ActionScript 3.0 provides direct access to the display list, so depth is handled differently.  onDragOut() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: mouseOut Replaced in the new event model by a mouseOut event.  onDragOver() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: mouseOver Replaced in the new event model by a mouseOver event.  onKeyDown() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: keyDown Replaced in the new event model by a keyDown event.  onKeyUp() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: keyUp Replaced in the new event model by a keyUp event.  onKillFocus() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: focusOut Replaced in the new event model by a focusOut event.  onPress() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: mouseDown Replaced in the new event model by a mouseDown event.  onRelease() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: mouseUp Replaced in the new event model by a mouseUp event.  onReleaseOutside() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: mouseUp Replaced in the new event model by a mouseUp event.  onRollOut() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: mouseOut Replaced in the new event model by a mouseOut event.  onRollOver() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: mouseOver Replaced in the new event model by a mouseOver event.  onSetFocus() EventHandler flash.display.InteractiveObject dispatches event: focusIn Replaced in the new event model by a focusIn event.

Color class flash.geom.ColorTransform The Color class has been removed because all of its functionality can be achieved with the flash.geom.ColorTransform class. Color values can be assigned directly by using the ColorTransform class constructor or properties. ColorTransform objects can then be assigned to the colorTransform property of a Transform object, which in turn can be assigned to the transform property of a DisplayObject instance.  Color Constructor flash.geom.ColorTransform.ColorTransform() Removed. You can specify color values by using the ColorTransform() constructor.  getRGB() Method flash.geom.ColorTransform.color The RGB color value can be accessed by using the color accessor property of the ColorTransform class.  getTransform() Method Removed Color values can be assigned directly by using the ColorTransform() class constructor or properties.  setRGB() Method flash.geom.ColorTransform.color The RGB color value can be set by using the color accessor property of the ColorTransform class.  setTransform() Method Removed Color values can be assigned directly by using the ColorTransform() class constructor or properties.   ContextMenu class flash.ui.ContextMenu The ContextMenu class is now part of the flash.ui package.  builtInItems Property flash.ui.ContextMenu.builtInItems   customItems Property flash.ui.ContextMenu.customItems   ContextMenu Constructor flash.ui.ContextMenu.ContextMenu()   copy() Method flash.ui.ContextMenu.clone()   hideBuiltInItems() Method flash.ui.ContextMenu.hideBuiltInItems()   onSelect() EventHandler flash.ui.ContextMenu dispatches event: menuSelect Instead of invoking the onSelect() event handler, the ActionScript 3.0 class dispatches a menuSelect event.   ContextMenuItem class flash.ui.ContextMenuItem The ContextMenuItem class is now part of the flash.ui package.  caption Property flash.ui.ContextMenuItem.caption   enabled Property flash.ui.ContextMenuItem.enabled   separatorBefore Property flash.ui.ContextMenuItem.separatorBefore   visible Property flash.ui.ContextMenuItem.visible   ContextMenuItem Constructor flash.ui.ContextMenuItem.ContextMenuItem()   copy() Method flash.ui.ContextMenuItem.clone()   onSelect() EventHandler flash.ui.ContextMenuItem dispatches event: menuItemSelect Instead of invoking the onSelect() event handler, the ActionScript 3.0 class dispatches a menuSelect event.   ConvolutionFilter class   clone() Method flash.filters.ConvolutionFilter.clone() Now returns a BitmapFilter object.   Date class Date ActionScript 3.0 includes a new set of read accessors for all the methods that start with getxxx(). For example, in ActionScript 3.0, Date.getDate() and Date.date return the same value.  getUTCYear() Method Date.getUTCFullYear() This method was removed because it is not part of ECMAScript. Use Date.getUTCFullYear() instead.  getYear() Method Date.getFullYear() This method was removed because it is not part of ECMAScript. Use Date.getFullYear() instead.  setYear() Method Date.setFullYear() This method was removed because it is not part of ECMAScript. Use Date.setFullYear() instead.   DisplacementMapFilter class flash.filters.DisplacementMapFilter The data type of several parameters changed from Number to uint.  color Property flash.filters.DisplacementMapFilter.color The data type of this parameter is now uint.  componentX Property flash.filters.DisplacementMapFilter.componentX The data type of this parameter is now uint.  componentY Property flash.filters.DisplacementMapFilter.componentY The data type of this parameter is now uint.  DisplacementMapFilter Constructor flash.filters.DisplacementMapFilter.DisplacementMapFilter() The data type of the componentX, componentY, and color parameters is now uint.  clone() Method flash.filters.DisplacementMapFilter.clone() Now returns a BitmapFilter object.   DropShadowFilter class flash.filters.DropShadowFilter   color Property flash.filters.DropShadowFilter.color The data type of this parameter changed from Number to uint.  quality Property flash.filters.DropShadowFilter.quality The data type of this parameter changed from Number to uint.  DropShadowFilter Constructor flash.filters.DropShadowFilter.DropShadowFilter() All parameters now have a default value, and some parameter types have changed.  clone() Method flash.filters.DropShadowFilter.clone() Now returns a BitmapFilter object instead of a DropShadowFilter object.   Error class Error Added a new getStackTrace() method to assist in debugging.   ExternalInterface class flash.external.ExternalInterface Parameters changed for two methods in this class.  addCallback() Method flash.external.ExternalInterface.addCallback() The ActionScript 3.0 version of this method does not accept the instance parameter. The method parameter is replaced by a closure parameter, which can take a reference to a function, a class method, or a method of a particular class instance. In addition, if the calling code cannot access the closure reference for security reasons, a SecurityError exception is thrown.  call() Method flash.external.ExternalInterface.call() If a problem occurs, the ActionScript 3.0 version of this method throws an Error or SecurityError exception, in addition to returning null.   FileReference class flash.net.FileReference The ActionScript 3.0 version inherits the addEventListener() and removeEventListener() methods from the EventDispatcher class. Dispatched events replace the event handler functions.  postData Property flash.net.URLRequest.data The postData property is added to ActionScript 2.0 in Flash Player 9 to send POST data with the file upload or download. In ActionScript 3.0, use the data property of the URLRequest class to send either POST or GET data. See flash.net.URLRequest.data in this language reference for details.  size Property[read-only] flash.net.FileReference.size Returns a uint data type instead of a Number data type.  addListener() Method flash.events.EventDispatcher.addEventListener() In the new event model, there is no need to have a class-specific addListener() method, because the class inherits the addEventListener() method from the EventDispatcher class.  browse() Method flash.net.FileReference.browse() In ActionScript 2.0, returns false when there is an error. In ActionScript 3.0, throws an IllegalOperationError or ArgumentError exception. However, the method still returns false if the parameters are invalid, the file-browsing dialog box does not open, or another browser session is in progress. Also, the typelist parameter changed. In ActionScript 2.0, you can pass the browse() method an array of strings to specify a file filter. In ActionScript 3.0, you pass an array of FileFilter objects.  download() Method flash.net.FileReference.download() When an error occurs, throws exceptions instead of returning false. The data type for the first parameter has changed. In ActionScript 2.0, the first parameter you pass to download() is a string. In ActionScript 3.0, you pass a URLRequest object.  removeListener() Method flash.events.EventDispatcher.removeEventListener() In the new event model, there is no need to have a class-specific removeListener() method, because the class inherits the removeEventListener() method from the EventDispatcher class.  upload() Method flash.net.FileReference.upload() Various changes have occurred: The data type for the first parameter has changed. In ActionScript 2.0, the first parameter you pass to upload() is a string. In ActionScript 3.0, you pass a URLRequest object. In ActionScript 3.0, there is a new second parameter, uploadDataFieldName, which is the field name that precedes the file data in the upload POST operation. In ActionScript 3.0, there is a new third parameter, testUpload, that lets you control whether Flash Player performs a test upload before uploading the file. When an error occurs, browse() throws exceptions instead of returning false.  onCancel Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: cancel In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onCancel() event handler, this class dispatches an event named cancel.  onComplete Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: complete In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onComplete() event handler, this class dispatches an event named complete.  onHTTPError Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: httpStatus In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onHTTPError() event handler, this class dispatches an event named httpStatus.  onIOError Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: ioError In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onIOError() event handler, this class dispatches an event named ioError.  onOpen Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: open In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onOpen() event handler, this class dispatches an event named open.  onProgress Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: progress In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onProgress() event handler, this class dispatches an event named progress.  onSecurityError Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: securityError In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onSecurityError() event handler, this class dispatches an event named securityError.  onSelect Listener flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: select In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onSelect() event handler, this class dispatches an event named select.  onUploadCompleteData flash.net.FileReference dispatches event: complete In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onUploadCompleteData() event handler, this class dispatches an event named uploadCompleteData.   FileReferenceList class flash.net.FileReferenceList The ActionScript 3.0 class inherits the addEventListener() and removeEventListener() methods from the EventDispatcher class. Instead of the onCancel() and onSelect() event handlers, the ActionScript 3.0 class uses events named cancel and select.  addListener() Method flash.events.EventDispatcher.addEventListener() In the new event model, there is no need to have a class-specific addListener() method, because the class inherits the addEventListener() method from the EventDispatcher class.  browse() Method flash.net.FileReferenceList.browse() In ActionScript 3.0, instead of returning false when there is an error, this method throws an IllegalOperationError exception. Also, the typelist parameter changed. In ActionScript 2.0, you can pass the browse() method an array of strings to specify a file filter. In ActionScript 3.0, you pass an array of FileFilter objects.  removeListener() Method flash.events.EventDispatcher.removeEventListener() In the new event model, there is no need to have a class-specific removeListener() method, because the class inherits the removeEventListener() method from the EventDispatcher class.  onCancel Listener flash.net.FileReferenceList dispatches event: cancel In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onCancel() event handler, this class dispatches an event named cancel.  onSelect Listener flash.net.FileReferenceList dispatches event: select In ActionScript 3.0, instead of invoking the onSelect() event handler, this class dispatches an event named select.   GlowFilter class flash.filters.GlowFilter The data type of several properties changed from Number to unit.  color Property flash.filters.GlowFilter.color The data type of this property changed from Number to unit.  quality Property flash.filters.GlowFilter.quality The data type of this property changed from Number to unit.  GlowFilter Constructor flash.filters.GlowFilter.GlowFilter() The color and quality parameters are now uint and int data types, respectively, instead of Number. All parameters are now assigned a default value.  clone() Method flash.filters.GlowFilter.clone() Returns a BitmapFilter object instead of a GlowFilter object.   GradientBevelFilter class flash.filters.GradientBevelFilter   quality Property flash.filters.GradientBevelFilter.quality The data type of this property changed from Number to int.  clone() Method flash.filters.GradientBevelFilter.clone() Returns a BitmapFilter object instead of a GradientBevelFilter object.   GradientGlowFilter class flash.filters.GradientGlowFilter   quality Property flash.filters.GradientGlowFilter.quality The data type of this property changed from Number to int.

The correct class and method to use for that situation should be URLLoader.load().
