I'm pretty sure I'm going to play some really cool old punk also. I'll probably rip like 25-30 songs of punk for the designated punk hr. oh yes with the likes of<strong> Fear, A.O.D., Battallion of Saints, Cro-Mags, Infamous Basturds, Gen Con</strong>, blah blah blah...<br />
&nbsp;Nice to be getting requests again! Remember if your radio reception isn't happenin' just stream it from this site! Request line is <em>fiveonefour-eightfoureight-sevenfoursevenone</em>.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to all of my listeners for your continuing support and interest.

<p><strong>BTG3, Friday, 19th of Dec.'08 : Best of '08 pt.3</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another installment of the best of 2008, the 3rd out of 4 to be more precise. This Friday the 19th of December&nbsp;I will be featuring the brutally insane<strong> Black Cobra</strong> album ' <em>Bestial</em> '. I could go on and on about how heavy this album is,&nbsp;but like I always say;&nbsp;if you're gonna shoot...shoot...don't talk.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keeping it in that heavy vein, also on deck will be the axe in the head that is <strong>Red Fang</strong>. These 2 alone should send my country and funk fans heading for cover....clapping their hands over their childrens ears...but I'm willing to make that sacrifice! Ha...not...all my minions will love it..'cause they know the drill after 13 of the last 18 years....<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll also have a little treat from local musician <strong>Dan Mangan</strong> from his release' <em>Postcards and Daydreaming</em> ' with a classicly&nbsp;depressing christmas themed song to cap off the night.&nbsp;Calling in is usually an option, you can do so by dialing <em>514-848-7471</em>.</p>

<p><strong>BTG3, Friday, 5th of Dec.'08 : Best of '08 pt.2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, another awsome show with another feature of of one of my favorite releases of 2008. I'm glad you all dug the <strong>King Hobo</strong> last week. Isn't that shit of the freakin' hook? Damn.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do beleive you'll have your mind completely rewired for the weekend. I have for you none other than the wide open sounds of <strong>The Soulbreaker Company</strong>. Their 2008 release of <em>The Pink Alchemist</em> really sets a higher bar for plenty of bands out there and that in itself is almost saintly .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These guys sound like...well, themselves actually, except for maybe one song that sounds like<em> Captain Beyond</em>, and maybe another that sounds Sabbathy..but really, a cool groove of their own. These fellows have been compared to <em>Black Oak Arkansas, Mountain, Lynard Skynard, Pentagram, Zeppelin, Uriah Heap</em>...I'm serious when I say they sound a little like <em>Los Lobos</em> meets....<em>Kyuss</em>...or <em>Santana</em> meets <em>Sabbath</em>...it's that weird.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on deck will be some awsome <strong>Bible of The Devil</strong>....classy metal alla 1983...only these guys are current and all...quite a juicy slice from the past served up nice and now. The # to call is 514-848-7471.</p>

<p><strong>BTG3, Friday, 28th of Nov.'08 : Best of '08 pt.1</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, you guys are in for one of my favorite albums&nbsp;released this year. I'm talking about the&nbsp;unholy&nbsp;union of <em>Jean-Paul Gaster</em>&nbsp;( <strong>Clutch</strong> ), <em>Per Wiberg</em> ( <strong>Opeth</strong> ), and <em>Eric Oblander</em> ( <strong>Five Horse Johnson</strong> )....ladies and gentlemen, I give you <strong>King Hobo</strong>. It weighs about a ton. You miss this show and you will contend with a heavy handed karmic merc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This album is sooo brutally funky it's almost like hearing<em> </em><strong>Deep Purple</strong> for the first time. I could go on and on..but instead; I&nbsp;choose to destroy everything you thought you knew to be heavy by ripping at least 4 songs from their debut&nbsp;masterpiece.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm pleased to be the&nbsp;first here at CJLO to bring forth this frothy super group, you can thank me later, as usual; money, sex, drugs..it's all legal tender to me...I ain't picky.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on deck some down right epic <strong>Blood Farmers</strong>. Call in at <strong>514-848-7471</strong> for some possible life suggestions, or a rude 3 word dismissal.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if you've found yourself on my dj page once again, you'll be pleased to find out that I will be ripping the brand new<strong> Dozer</strong> release ' <em>Beyond Colossal</em> '. It's like urine running down a terrified leg ; warm, relieving....yet forbodeing. Such a valient effort from these guys, considering how their last&nbsp;one fell a little short of the BTG3 standard...I was highly disappointed. This one blows doors...so check it out...I'll be rippin' a few from it.<br />
&nbsp; Also on deck will be the new <strong>Tim's Myth</strong> album&nbsp;' <em>Harbour</em> '. Local pros given' 'er hard. Features my old friend Stefan Gaudreau, one of the most prolific session drummers on this planet...wicked local boys doin' it right.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there , just a quick note&nbsp; for what's on deck for the next onslaught ..I've got the brand new <strong>Clutch</strong> album called ' <em>Full Fathom Five</em> '. It's live and it's not a light listen...this is a compilation of 4 U.S. dates (one on New Year's Eve ) and 1 show from Australia.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It's pretty metalicious for <strong>Clutch</strong> I must say..it'll fit perfectly 'cause I'm pullin' out some vicious metal a soir chalise!. I've got the new <strong>Skeleton Witch</strong> that I had given you a taster of last show...the album is called ' <em>Beyond The Permafrost </em>'. Man is it brutal, like <strong>Merciful Fate</strong> meets <strong>Mastodon</strong>, it's the only way I like to hear dualing guitars in this genre...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I have the downright weird <strong>Spleen VS Ideal</strong>, a band from France with their new release ' <em>Souvenirs</em> '.

<p><strong>Petunia@The Yellow Door September 23 '08-Hillbilly</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it's been a little less than a year since Montreal got a taste of Petunia..so what a treat it was to see him play this tiny little venue called&nbsp;The Yellow Door on Aylmer. With a co-ops social charm, this place is literally the oldest ' coffee house '&nbsp;in North America.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although pleasantly&nbsp;lacking the typical beatnic ubervibe of some of these&nbsp;legendary poetry/folk haunts, there was a distinct aura of.....illumination after entering..dig? Like what your're about to witness is important..necessary&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My old friend Petunia rolled through town as usual..like a high plains drifter..barely announced..more..let's say&nbsp;...anticipated. This is story telling at it's best my friends. Old school, old timey..it's freaky to see some one I've known for years to tap..so deeply and profoundly into hill/rockabilly, country and bluegrass..so naturally..jebus..I didn't even know he played guitar 10 years ago..and to be honest ..he didn't.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petunia delivers a slice of life from the present in the words and music of the past...like ..Hank&nbsp;Von Steinbeck from the 25th century?&nbsp; His vocal delivery can be so sorrow filled and haunting one minute and down right evil and ornery the next. Strummin' an' a pickin' through his sometimes dark stories of a lifes experiences..he proceeded to captivate a small audience of hard core country buffs..who could find the time (and the place) on a Tuesday evening.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Country music..in a cafe..with tea 'n' coffee....would you beleive there wasn't a drop of brown liquor in the place? That was weird...not that I was shakin' for it or anything...just would have been nice to git some corn squeezin's is all. I'll have to talk to you about that Molly..but mum's the word.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petunia kicked right into things with a couple of rockabilly tunes, one about Mexico..pretty song..' Dixie Fried ',' Yes Baby Yes '....he played '&nbsp;Not in My Name ', ' Teardrops Rollin' , ' Breakmans Blues ',' Sunset Blues ', his awsome ' Cricket Song '..definately a favorite with&nbsp;most of the audience.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally thought his haunting piece ' Ballad of Hansome Ned ' was the song of the night ..what a performance. Singin', playin' guit., kazoo, and yodelling..fuck around..solid people..solid performance. Neil Young high on the dixie dust folks... He delivered ' Ain't No Grave ' with the grace of a eulogist..in a good way..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Wake Up Sinners ',' Mercy '- another one of my favorites about sellin' your soul and one's mental state in times of extreme duress, ' Cattle Call '- with a little crowd participation..you had to have been there..more people should have mooed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Hillbilly Hot ' was too wicked, Petunia has some mighty scales of desert doom which he plays like he literally sold his soul...I'm going to have to talk to him about that!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly enough, one of the heaviest tunes he played that night was when he played a song from the new Kris Kristophersson album..have you heard it..it's already won a spot on my end of the year top 10 albums list..I can tell you that much. The other stand out ( they all bloodywell stood out ) tune for me was ' Ugliest, Bitterest, Coldest, Dreariest Place I've Ever Seen '.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh ya, I got him to play.. what's that song called.." Circle be Unbroken '..too lazy to google it guys..the 'ol timey.." bye and bye lord, bye and bye .." song? Classic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moving performance, which we ( me, Ron and Petunia..we call him by his birth name..in case you're wondering..I just can't seem to call him Petunia after all these years!)&nbsp;soon followed with 3- 45 minute&nbsp;rounds of Texas Hold 'em at Elsee's...and yes&nbsp;we were hittin' the tonsil varnish..finally got some neck paint in us in&nbsp;the form of single malt scotch....with a small bunch&nbsp;of enthused liquor enabled Irish/Australian tourists cheering us on....the night was a three pointer at the last 2 seconds of a b.ball game.. a fuckin' sweet victory.</p>

<p><strong>CHARGED G.B.H @Foufs, Sept.14'08</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been 23yrs. since this band has been in town..so pretty much their 3rd show here in Montreal and what better venue than the Foufounes Electriques...too punk rock..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, not quite as punk rock as the Rising Sun's G.B.H./ Unruled show in '83 but close enough...the smells were..i can attest to that....yikes, it smelled worse in that club last night than ..like...the worst toilet in Scotland ..you hear me? Rotting squatter corpse's diaper...you get&nbsp;...the drift&nbsp;? PUNK ROCK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me tell you; highly politically charged lyrics coupled with one of the highest energy bands ever to assemble...you got something special. This punk band blew doors on almost any other British punk band around at the time...and obviously especially ringing true today. These mutants haven't stopped putting out records or touring...17 albums later folks..that's ridiculous in itself..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They weren't -in my book- a punk band musically..they were a fast rock band with a brutal metal sound, this ain't like the Sex Pistols...this is like, almost Discharge heavy...Motorhead fast..well..old Motorhead fast I mean..that's the scene.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their pace was tight, fast and brutal; after the house soundman, whoever the latest one is, managed to find a nice equalibrium between the monitors and the mic, Colin Abrahall let some shit go like a fuckin' champ...although I couldn't beleive how much he resembled Hughy Lewis....something that haunted me throughout the show and amused my whole crew..and speaking&nbsp;of crews; theirs was almost complete, safe for their original drummer Andrew Williams.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ross Lomas was absolutely <em>flying</em> on his monsterous trade marked bass sweeps. Totally on point, that guy was..Freakin' Birmingham..mate, their so fucking from the Middlands it's hysterical..it's all so&nbsp; " pour us a pint mate.." and&nbsp;" ..get stuffed" and " piss&nbsp;of "&nbsp; and "&nbsp;fah....ckin' &nbsp;'ell mate.."....kapisch?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin Blyths guitar tone was just how it always was...double humbuckers for pickups..his amp firing out the sonic chunk&nbsp;that is his bread and butter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ripped through a blazing set of hits like ' Time Bomb ', 'Necrophiliac', 'Freak', the brutal '&nbsp;No Survivors ',&nbsp;the anthemic ' Generals '&nbsp; a song, unfortunately&nbsp; being so relevant again&nbsp;today; what with America starting all kind of wars..again..&nbsp;fucking heav' moment..that eerily had everyone one the same page for&nbsp;a sec..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their energy was off the hook totally&nbsp;in tandem with the crowds' for their songs ' City Babys Attacked By Rats " and&nbsp;' City Babys Revenge ' which they played&nbsp;back to back.&nbsp;They absolutely destroyed the place with one of my personal faves ' Sick Boy ' ...aaahhhhhhrrgh&nbsp; " I'm a sick boy....mess you up.." makes you want to hand out flowers, and buy cookies&nbsp;from a girl scout.....maybe a long insightful conversation with a Jehovah's Witness...over&nbsp;a spot of tea....not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played ' Big Girls '&nbsp;with a stage full of women from the audience...too rock star, so silly....G.B.H. ripped through a cover of the Stooges classic ' 1970 '&nbsp;&nbsp;and played the fastest version of the Clashs' ' White Riot '&nbsp; that&nbsp;I've ever heard. Really old school vibe.&nbsp;A meeting of the old guard in a way..saw a lot of&nbsp;familiar faces...ahhh&nbsp;made the lot of us feel ancient...what ah ya gonna do..a lot of blasts from the past came to mind...&nbsp;G.B.H. rocked a new one from an upcoming album and it was wicked..encore finished with their classic ' Alcohol '&nbsp;...." alcohol oh alcohol I love you in my brain...".... indeed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular Montreal show was the 40th and last of their 3 month North American tour so they were pretty balls out..it was something to see....did I mention that it was like 100 degrees in that club? Fucking ridiculous....ahh the Foufes,&nbsp;&nbsp;everyones favorite shit-hole.....up yours...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fu Manchu @ Cafe Campus, August 28'08</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last time I saw these guys, was November....26, 1997 at Foufs. I never forget a perfect storm.&nbsp;What a brutaly tight and foamy onslaught of pure Cali sunshine. My band mates and I were totally blown away, same line up tonight except for the drummer,&nbsp;in '97 it&nbsp;was Alfredo Hernandez( ex-Kyuss, Vic Dumonte, Brant Bjork ), tonight it was Scott Reeder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What shitty karma, or more realistically, what twit booker from hell managed to book these monsters of stoner-rock at the Cafe Campus. That place has less sole than a leggless hippie. Seriously though,&nbsp; Fu Manchu makes it happen regardless&nbsp;; wether&nbsp;they're stuffed into a bar that turns into a disco at 11:00 or not....<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked into the place after the first 3 songs..aaaaaarrhh... hate missing those songs but hey,...what are you gonna do: driveing to&nbsp;a show during the construction season in Montreal is a bloody crap shoot at best. I think we missed " Trapese Freak ", and " Tilt " ? Sourses told me some songs from the&nbsp; 1995 album' Daredevil&nbsp;'. We walked into " Evil Eye "&nbsp;from their ' The Action Is Go ' album. Awsome sound..., like being slapped with cotton candy and then doused with blue fire.....mmmm...in a good way...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the same ' Daredevil ' album they slammed the audiences' sences with an avalanche like delivery of their song " Saturn lll "..so, so heavy. Lead guitarist Bob Balch is a heighnous abuser of the wah; his tone..&nbsp;unabashed, pure wah gold, like honey from the jar..it's a musical homeage to like.... sasperhila, or cream soda, or b.b.q. pork...you dig?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound was like what it must feel like to ride in a tank, vaccuous reverb to the point of perfect tone, a humming behind your jaw, constant and driving, like going over a metal bridge and hummin' in key with the sound of your tires...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fuzz tones that were swirling , in perfect time with the bass, from Scott Hill's clear ampeg guit, honestly always reminds me of that first rythm guitar player from the Cramps, what was his....Brian Gregory..that's it..the guy that looks like G.E. Smiths evil twin..classic fuzz people, it doesn't get much better than this.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when&nbsp;they tore the shit out of " King Of The Road " and absolutely sauntered through " Boogie Van " and&nbsp;raced through&nbsp;" Hell On Wheels " at almost 3 times the regular tempo,( made the crowd collectively wet itself );&nbsp;all 3 songs&nbsp;from their wicked 1999&nbsp;'&nbsp;King Of the Road ' release. So analogue, so chewy..like nugat and carmel..like a Mars bar..but with real chocolate.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Coyote Duster ", from '&nbsp;Dardevil ' was another mind bomb, followed by their latter version of " Mongoose ", redone on their hugely popular ' California Crossing ' album from 2002. That song was originally released on Man's Ruin, back in the day, you've probably heard me play it once in a blue moon on Beyond That Graveyard lll, the original is filthy with it. They played a&nbsp;sick version of " Hung Out To Dry " from their ' We Must Obey ' release from 2007.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They layed out layer after layer of sweet, warm sunshine and came back for an encore. They asked for requests, and I swear, you could have almost heard a pin drop, so, being the loud assed fucker that I am ( totally sober now, ..no foolin'), I yelled out for their classic cover of Blue Oyster Cult's hit " Godzilla "..and after a smokin' bass solo from their original bass player Brad Davis, they said they would play 2 more short ones.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They wailed through the first song of the encore; pretty sure it was " Eatin' Dust " from another Man's Ruin release and here's the kicker of the night...they played " Godzilla ". I shit you not, Scott heard my loud ass before the encore, and fucking rolled right into a 7 minute version of it...too much; my friends were on the floor..it's like when I saw Sabbath in '83, remember..they came with Ian Gillan( Deep Purple) supporting their Born Again album: me and my buddies ( we were like 15yrs. old tops..)&nbsp;kept yelling " Supernaught " and low and behold, Gillan dropped the hammer hard on that one. Never wanted to here Ozzy do it after I&nbsp; heard that version....I can tell you that..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fu came,&nbsp; the Fu saw,&nbsp;and the Fu&nbsp;kicked our ass again....nothing more comforting than knowing exactly what to expect...and getting it..<br />

<p><strong>IGGY and the STOOGES-Osheaga'08</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......and to think I almost missed this one...thank you&nbsp;H.P.L. for reminding me the day before...I owe you ...a big one.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now.... all day long outdoor blowouts are not usually my thing but there's no sacrifice too large to see Iggy Pop and the Stooges...none. ( I strategicly showed up at 6:00pm).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These guys are in the middle of a world tour and they were <em>smokin'</em>. Nothing like 30 shows to bring you to your cruising speed. Iggy, Scott and Ron Ashton, Steven Makay, and Mike Watt let 'er rip&nbsp;so honestly (you could tell) they were lovin' every second of it. Musicians unlike sports stars..get better with age...that's just the way it is, and singers, well Iggy is Iggy and that's usually way more than&nbsp;enough...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ron Ashton's fuzzy mantra like riffs filled the humid air over Parc Jean Drapeau like a fat assed rainbow. I thought we were going to get rained on by acid spiked skittles. I honestly think those fuckers promted a flashback, I swear, I saw Iggy leaving tracers every&nbsp;time he moved. I can't even to begin to list how many guitar players have geared their rigs to emulate Ron Ashtons fuzztones.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott Ashton; this guy, after all these years, not only keeps the classic Stooges beats in line with one of the hardest snaps possessed by any drummer, he's like literally a metronome. The pop of that snare alone should be enough&nbsp;to land this guy in the Rock 'N' Roll hall of fame.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These guys ripped out ' 1970 ' at twice it's regular tempo, ' Down On The Street ', ' No Fun ', ' I Wanna Be Your Dog ', ' Search&nbsp;and Destroy '...<em>brutal</em>, ' My Idea of Fun ', ' Real Good Time '. It was off the fucking hook, plain and simple; to see the original punk/stoner rockers lay down THE classics from their short, infamous,&nbsp;yet seriuosly messed up carreer. I could go deaf tomorrow, and it would bother me a lot less, now&nbsp;having seen the Stooges, you dig?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike Watt is this bands new superglue. What a monster bass player. Co-founder of the Minutemen, Firehose, reasently playing with Jay Mascis/Dinosaur Jr....this guy literally got me pluckin' my Gibson&nbsp;E-BO last night when I got home from the show...that inspiring...&nbsp;between him and Makay's spasticatedly brilliant spatterings, the sound was so complete.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iggy&nbsp;was Iggy and nobody, but nobody can sing through a song so well, while being tossed back and forth in the crowd, like this dude...and he's..like 60..you ever see a 60 year old guy crowd surf with that kind of authority? I can easily say that I haven't...and I've ...seen ......some shit in my day, I'll tell you that.&nbsp; He wasted no time in jumping Watt's stacks and humping the shit out of them, classic, never get's old, you'd think it would.... he was so into it, taunting and strutting around, talking to the crowd, not at them- is an Iggy treat, like scooby snacks..but better.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took a multitude of trips to the Little Penguin wine tent and got sloppy with the shiraz, before and after Sharon Jones&nbsp;and the Dap band. What a wailing performance by Sharon Jones. She rocked the SHIT out of that crowd, best energy of a female performance I've ever witnessed...and what a tight assed horn section, the likes of which&nbsp;I've not seen since Maceo Parker and his crew got down. So we were&nbsp;well lubed for the&nbsp;Stooges.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High point of the evening;&nbsp;sharing a doobie with a&nbsp;hottie that I've never&nbsp;seen before during Search and Destroy.( another horrible penless moment!). I lost my posse goin' in to the crowd, found them at the wine tent after, a real personal moment with the&nbsp;Stooges, untainted by useless banter...a golden moment.&nbsp;Oh, yeah, the crowd...a mix of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation Stooges fans,&nbsp;were all totally on the same page&nbsp;from the book of AAAhhhh, holy fuckin' crap it's Iggy and the Stooges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got the new<em> <strong>Cortez</strong></em>.&nbsp; It's called <em>' Thunder In A Forgotten Town '</em>.This stoner-rock doom band hails from Boston although they are actually formed out of 2 bands; the singer, bassist, guitarist and drummer are from<em> <strong>Sin City Chainsaw</strong>, </em>and the 2nd guit. player is from<em> <strong>Super Soul Challenger</strong></em>. I've got their latest ep. It's stacked with raw riffs and tons of wah.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also gonna play for your listening pleasure of coarse, the brand spankin' new <em><strong>Totimoshi </strong></em>cd '<em> Milagrosa</em> '. It's freaky, can't pin it to one specific genre, a really wild one for the new release part of the show.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I didn't get to that southern rock set last week, so I'll try and fit that in this week for sure. With a little <em><strong>Polecat Boogie Revival</strong></em>.<br />

<p><strong>Thar'll Be Some South In Your Mouth..and Some Free</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O.k., I'm going to be rollin' the musical dice a little south of the border and then some. Got some <strong>Datura</strong> that I couldn't get to last Fri. night and a mess of country fried mayhem. I'm also going to <em>give away 5 free passes</em> to the <strong>Steve Jones and the Legendary Ernies</strong> show that's happening at the <em>Saphire</em> club at<strong> 3699 St. Laurent Blvd</strong>. this Saturday night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got the brand new album ' <em>Death Ride</em> ' from one of my favorite Texas bands,<strong> Blood of the Sun</strong>. This is their 3rd album in..like.... more than 10yrs..well worth the wait, I can't even begin to describe to you how far this band has come. This just came out ...so you guys are so getting spoiled with new releases&nbsp;right here at <strong>BTG3</strong>...as always.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This latest effort also features their new member, get this, Derek St. Holmes. The dude from the <strong>Ted Nugent Band</strong>( of the '70's )...what a mind fuck that is...you know this guit. player; he plays guit.&nbsp;in the song " <em>Stranglehold</em> ",&nbsp; that guy. He is a freak of nature on guitar and adds some well needed oxygen to the fire that burns as <strong>Blood of the Sun</strong>. The keyboards alone on this album elevate these guys to like <strong>Deep Purple</strong> good, <strong>the Band</strong> good...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to play some hilarious <strong>Polecat Boogie Revival</strong>, it's so bloody stupid that it's La Vache Qui Rie funny hostie. That'll keep the southern fire alight for another few songs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My blast from the recent past will come in the form of <strong>Space Probe Taurus</strong>...with a name like that...you have to be really, really.....really good, and these dudes really, really....really are.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call me at <strong>514-848-7471 to win some concert passes</strong>&nbsp;and I'll try, really, really.....really try to be nice.</p>

<p><strong>We're Gonna Have To Get A Doctor For That</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alrighty tighty; this show will feature the awsome Black Cobra vinyl ' <em>Feather and Stone</em> '. If you like High On Fire then you'll appreciate this drum /guitar duo. The guitar player has a very distinct sound, hovers right around Matt Pike's toneality, but sounds like&nbsp;he has to get it out a little more urgently....panic/metal is a good way to describe it...you'll all fall in love with it I'm sure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to premiering the new Colour Haze album '<em> All</em> ' for the new release part of the show. It's meaty, real chewy, like 5 Hubba Bubbas at once, only steak flavored. You're all going to bow your lonley heads in respect and admiration when this ones over.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on deck will be a cool blast from&nbsp;'97; with&nbsp;their recently re-released&nbsp; piece of plastic&nbsp;' <em>All is One</em> ',&nbsp; Datura lays it down&nbsp;pretty thick with the sludge....but it ain't slow... dat's fo sho. These New Zealand metalers lay it down hard and they sure sound like they mean it. Sounds like they would have been a no-brainer for the Man's Ruin label back then when that kind of music didn't blow donkey dick like it does now ....in abundance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A total blast from the <em>Beyond That Graveyard</em> past will be in as a guest DJ a soir chalise, the one and only <strong>John ' Dr. Death '&nbsp;Lozano</strong>. We grew up listening to the heaviest of metal and the most brutal punk back in the '70's and '80's, and both had college radio shows, him at Abbott and me at Dawson/Concordia. Both of us were in brutal bands..&nbsp;Rabid, Jack Boot &amp; the Oppressors...Legends of Debauchery would be putting lightly, you're all in for some hard core stories and music the likes of which only a few of you have seen and/or dreamt of. There might even be a visit from local metal celebrity Ed Shahini.....<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shout out to my listeners in Portland, Maine. I &nbsp;can't wait to go longboarding with y'all in August...I'm already dreaming of those long assed breaks. Now ...where the hell did I leave my wetsuit at? Call in at 514-848-7471 and we'll talk politics...yeah...politics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riiight: this weeks show will be full of juicy new tunes from the likes of <em>The Freek's, Dead Man,</em> and <em>Blowback.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Freek's</em> is a wicked conglomeration of styles from a veritable cornucopia of musicians. You could definately call&nbsp;these guys&nbsp;a super-group. Featuring <em>Scott Reeder</em>( Kyuss, Obsessed, Unida), <em>Rueben Romano</em>( Nebula, Fu Manchu),<em> Bernie Worell</em>( Parliament-Funkadelic),<em> Lorenzo Woodrose</em>( Baby Woodrose)..it's downright feakish. You.... will.... love it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brand new <em>Dead Man</em> release " <em>Euphoria</em> ", it's way chill, insane snippets that seemed to have been sliced right off of a '70's multigrain of some sort. Real image driven shit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, I've got a copy of the awsome <em>Blowback</em> album " <em>Morning Wood</em> ". These guys put on a very serious show, and we're lucky enough to have a few live tracks on this very album.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big ' Hello and Thank's For Listening', to all of my peeps in Ontario, Iowa, Texas, Cali&nbsp;and y'all in England and Germany, and my new Scandinavian listeners&nbsp;you know it's all worth while to me when I here from you guys...and all of my local fans from here in Mtl., I know I never thank you guys enough! Call in at <em>514-848-7471</em> and I'll see if I can throw something on for you.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O.K., here's the scene: I just re-installed&nbsp;my monster Alpine MP3 system into my new car. I'm thinking; what would sound absolutely retarded, now that I have my kick ass system in the new vehicle. How about the 1999 Tee Pee Records release from N.Y.C.'s <em>Chrome Locust</em>. Nothing sounds as good as when it's comin' through 6 speakers and a 600 watt power amp...in a small car...sweet Mama Luccia.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't reached for that one since my<em> Beyond That Graveyard ll</em> days; spring of '99 in fact. So...... to show some respect to both the band and my minions ( new and old guard;&nbsp;' <em>Gravies</em> ' as you sometimes call yourselves..), I will be playing the shit out of their eponymous album. It's too... god.... damn ....heavy. Think <em>Black Sabbath</em> meets <em>MC5</em>... played by some of the originators of Hard Core: it's that sick/simple.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Featuring <em>Todd Youth</em> -ex<em> Agnostic Front, Murphy's Law, D Generation</em>, <em>Mikey Wildwood</em>-ex<em> D Generation</em>, and <em>Jim Heneghan</em>-ex <em>Vasquez</em>. These guys ripped a fucking whole in time and space with this little mastermess. Many a famous musician have tried to emulate, duplicate, postulate&nbsp;but fail and just simply masturbate, when hopeing to tap into&nbsp;that kind of energy. Nobody, and I do mean N O B O D Y &nbsp;plays like Todd Youth...fuckin' nobody.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be throwin' down ' <em>Ain't No Love ', ' Drop ', ' Love Rap ', ' Teen Dreem ', ' Formula ', </em>and<em> ' M.I.A</em>. '. These guys have influenced so many that it's almost pointless...but, like...<em>Sheavy, Queens of the Stone Age, Velvet Revolver, S.T.P....Gluecifer</em>...you get the picture. They've played shows with <em>Q.O.T.S.A., Mudhoney, Bad Brains, Sixty Watt Shaman, Hellacopters,Raging Slab</em>. If that's not an eclectic bunch...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love it, 'cause it's happening. If you like it, you can still find copies of this cd at <a href="http://www.stonerrock.com/">http://www.stonerrock.com/</a>&nbsp;. You'll also be privey to a whole lotta good 'old B.T.G.ll mainstaples . I have just got my hands on the gorgeous new lolly pop vinyl gatefold from <em>Solace</em>, the album <em>Further</em>. It's zuppa heav. # to call as always is <em>514-848-7471</em>.</p>

<p><strong>It's Casual..No...Really</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got some wicked L.A. hardcore comin' your way this Fri. 6th 2008. They're called<em> It's Casual</em>, but there really isn't anything casual about them, I have a nice limited edition swirly lollipop vinyl of their re-released 2002 effort<em>-Buicregl</em> that is loaded and ready to go for y'all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, some of T.O.'s finest with Mopa Dean's-ex <em>Armed &amp; Hammered</em>- band <em>The G-Men</em> and their filthy <em>Up The Dose</em> cd. Put it this way, there's a G.G. Allin cover...yikes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm glad you liked the last show 2 weeks ago. I featured the first 2 sides of the brand new <em>Brant Bjork</em> release <em>Punk Rock Guilt</em>, I will be playing sides 3 and 4 this week as well, (cause you guys loved it so much).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll be a pretty hardcore/punk show in general. Some <em>Gen.

<p><strong>Oooowee</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotta love express mail, son. This week I have the awsome new Brant Bjork vinyl, it's freakin' wicked. The gatefold sleeve opens to a '70's style photo of Bjork wailing away. It's too much. <em>' Punk Rock Guilt '</em> is super solid, analogue to the max, dripping slow honey from the jar of&nbsp;heavy. If analogue was an ice-cream flavor it would be called Brant Bjork.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have some cool Reino Ermitano&nbsp;and their album<em> ' Brujas Del Mar '</em>. It's some seriously textured South American mountain doom complete with leathered drums, and ghetto wooden flutes...creepy yet comfortable.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tune in or be hunted down like a dirty, filthy, ugly, smelly, maingy, rabid wilderbeast. I will leave your severed head upon a bloody spike on your parents front lawn. It won't get better from there either, I assure you. Call in if you dare at <em>514-848-7471.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week you will be witness to a few gems like the latest<em> Farflung</em> cd; " <em>A Wound In Eternity</em> ". It's a madhouse...a madhouse. A juicey morsel from a band called <em>Rainbows Are Free</em>, and a few tunes from their debut ep. It's doomy...in an optimistic way, if that makes any sense whatsoever. This ep doesn't but I'll play the good ones.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some awsome <em>Gorilla</em> from the " <em>Gimme Some</em> " release, some <em>Stonewall Noise Orchestra</em>, and the 2nd wicked release from one of my 'ol mainstays <em>Floating Goat</em>...it's shorter but no sweeter than what you'd expect; " <em>The Vultures Arrive</em>&nbsp; " is&nbsp;tight as shit and happy to be angry..heart warming.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we're lucky, South-Side Robbie will grace us with his awsome tastes and selections this very Friday the 9th of May. Don't forget my minions, Sunday is Mother's Day. What... you think I'm fucking joking? The # as always is 514-848-7471.</p>

<p><strong>You're Fucked...In A Good Way</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah....not much to say accept...you're in some deep metal up your ass trouble. Nobody loves you and you will celebrate this fact with an unholy wardance: filled with hatred, destruction and the odd alimony payment...what?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You will feast on angst, the fear of failing and the fact that we'll be filling our gas tanks to the tune of $100.00 every time we need to go somewhere other than the corner store.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What ain't pretty will fill the hours of your discontent. Fear and loathing are a mere appetizer to what will be perpetrated this fine Friday the 2nd of May. The # as always is 514-848-7471. Use it or have it hung, drawn and quartered.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond That Graveyard Pt.lll, Friday April 18th, 2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got the brand new Earth album- " <em>The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull</em> ". It is pretty f#*king spot on. No..really..it's wicked. I'm going to spin the shit out of that album, just so that y'all know this coming into the show on Friday. As long as we're clear.&nbsp;Earth keep getting better and better. A rare thing these days.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my many partners in crime here behind the scenes at Beyond That Graveyard Pt.lll is my friend Chris Barnes..( Hellride Music ), all the way from Redondo Beach California. This guy is always lookin' out for me/you guys; let me tell ya. This time he's sent me 2 fantabulous pre-releases. One is a limited edition preview of&nbsp;upcoming Fuzztones lp -" <em>Fuzz For Zombies</em> ". It's brain scoopingly delicious. I'll be playing the songs " <em>Idol Chatter</em> " and " <em>A Wristwatch Band </em>&nbsp;".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris also sent me the full length cd&nbsp;from Farmakon-' <em>Robin</em> " for all of my metal minions. To be officially released on April 29 2008, it's their best material to date, and they've been around for what...8 years now? They still look like they're 18yrs. old.. it's high-larious. Seriously though, that drummer of theirs...he's silly in a Neil Pert kind of way, actually, more like that beast in Mastodon. I'll be playing " <em>Recondite</em> ", " <em>Sixty-Nine</em> " and " <em>A Temporary Death</em> ". Don't you guys feel lucky? Thanks Chris..you R U L E .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also on deck will be the awsome German band UGH....from our friends over at Electrohasch Records...god bless 'em. Weird doom-kraut-stoner...very interesting indeedy. I think I'll drop one of my favorite eps from last year- The Goddamned's " <em>Head First</em> " release....it's a quick and brutal lesson in syncopation. Love it...I do.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, the # to call me at CJLO is <em>514-848-7471</em>. Hello to all y'all down in Texas, I didn't forget you Tinkey Winky, and to Wes Stejeck in West Vagina...I mean Virginia. Sean and Alex in Iowa..you're in deep when you come to visit this July. To my sister Stephanie in Ottawa, call and ask for Nina Hagen...ask me!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got the new Witch album. It's my favorite one to date,; I have to say, the first one did nothing for me......but this one? Shheeeit. It's called <em>Paralyzed</em> and it's just bursting out of it's seams on every track. Down and dirty, much more cohesive within it's songs. They still have that frenetic, heavy sixties tempo, but not as sugary sounding, you know what&nbsp;I mean?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O.K., a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and some cool sounding Pretty Faces from their freak of a 45rpm featuring their unforgetable power ballad '<em> Strap Your Body With Explosives and Position Yourself Next to a Major World Leader</em> '. Some cool older&nbsp;Fireball Ministry. A couple of tracks from each of their two&nbsp;earlier albums, '&nbsp;<em>FMEP</em> '&nbsp;and ' <em>The Second Great Awakening</em> '. Some Fistula for those bruisers out there listening..waiting for me to come out and play. Sorry, got the show tonight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The # to call is always 514-848-7471. Love it.<br />

<p><strong>Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso U.F.O</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To say that this performance was off the hook, would be like saying...war is a bummer. I honestly don't even know how to approach this review. I'm so glad it went down at the Sala Rossa last night; the 27th of March'08. Pretty much one of my all time favorite venues. Built for sound by the Jewish Workers Union in the '30's as a conference/social hall, it was taken over by a Spanish community group in the '70's. This hall was specifically designed for musical performances. So no matter what the style of music, it will sound good...even great.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no&nbsp;regular way that I can approach this as a concert review in the classic sense. This band is an enigma for lack of a better word. A constantly touring,( this month...19 shows in a f**king row!! )&nbsp;never ending avalanche( tornado, earthquake, tsunami ) of psychedelic/percussive/wailing /brain melting/vocally&nbsp;tribal outbursts, that trancends many a label. I've got like 5 of their albums; of which 85% are almost completely unlistenable. THIS IS A LIVE BAND, I cannot stress this enough.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The center of this " universe " called <em>Acid Mothers Temple and the Melting Paraiso U.F.O.</em> is guitarist( speed guru ) <em>Kawabata Makoto</em>. A Japanese guitar vertuoso with as many releases as<em> Frank Zappa</em>....and released in only half the amount of time, I might add! A visionary of sorts, this guy must have had/is having a hard time blazing his trail in the strict, musically formal society that is his Japan. This band, a tighter, more steamlined / abreviated version of the Temple that roled through Mtl. the last time; were as tight as it gets. Lucky to finally&nbsp;play here after consecutive cancellations; border issues are always a major problem for this band, and there are usually 2 or 3 other members involved, but in no way, shape or form were they missed. It just doesn't work that way with their ever flowing dynamic. It's so Japanese in spirit and intensity..playful, yet serious, I would even say spiritual. I never use that adjective but there's a first for everything I guess.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when you think that all of this thick,( I'm not talking thick like molasses, I'm talking thick like..tar )&nbsp;gooey madness is being played off the cuff, you realise it's all just another well thought out tune. I've seen no one ever accomplish this as these guys can...ever. Speaking to the drummer at the merch counter during an extended wait after the first band Danava blew the last of a bunch of guitar amps during this very tour, I knew I was in for a treat.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> Shimura Koji</em> (&nbsp;drums, latino cool&nbsp;) looks like that old guy you see in a Chinatown/Mexican restaurant; like he's there to check up on his investment, you know the serious type that looks like he's never, ever cracked as much as a smirk. This old dude busticated his kit like it was begging for it. Flowing like Billy Cobham, with direct blows of thunderous fortitude, you'd never imagine these beats coming from&nbsp;this little old man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Tsuyama Atsushi</em>; ( monster bass, cosmic joker )&nbsp;is by far one of the most mechanicaly incline bass players I have ever witnessed. This guy is like a freaking robot. Each note fretted like it was his last, uncompareable to most anyone, this guy also sang most of the songs and&nbsp;brought the humor to the performance. Playing with the few french words he knew, he broke into what sounded like an old " Voyageur " shanty, in a whirlwind of psychedelic rain. Nothing like seeing a Japanese guy smart the french! This guy was busting loose with what sounded like classic Inuit throat chanting...except he was doing it by himself. What a trip.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On keyboards/moog/telecaster was the most freaked out looking Japanese guy I have ever seen...ever.<em> Higashi Hiroshi</em> ( keys, guit, dancing king ) brought the psychedelic element to the table like he went into the forest for a week&nbsp;before shooting it. He hung that style from a hook and aged it before he cooked it up. To say that this guy has confidence in his performance, well, let's just say he's like the Castro of cosmic. The tones that this guy was bending, you'd think that you were literally on acid..for those of you who've never done a bad assed bitter blotter, I can't help you here. Just go see them, it's the only way you'll understand..(or not).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these essential four elements were melting into a rising comet of flexing notes and tones, who's colours flooded the Sala Rossa with ideas; like musical hope- a rare feeling at that. A promise of new ground breaking music. Their latest double album was just released last month. " <em>Recurring Dream and Apocalypse of Darkness</em> " is just that.&nbsp;These guys are psychedelic&nbsp;but not&nbsp;only in the classical sense; but in a new, more pro-active form. Dude, it was highly organic dude...and for these older guys to keep this up with the intensity that they did; for 2 hours.... is f**ked up. Did I mention that the place was almost sold out...on a weeknight?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danava were like a cross between<em> Sabbath</em> and<em> Rush</em>. Musically wicked but the singing had that " I know I can't sing, and that's why I am " thing going on. A purposely dead vocal performance, kind of weird and disconcerting. Very avant guard you could say.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they ever make it back, I implore you to check them out. It is something that you will not only never forget, but probably something that you&nbsp; will never see anywhere else.&nbsp; A performance that was perpetrated with style, mayham and musical honesty; to the likes of which I have rarely seen.<br />

<p><strong>BTG3, March 28th 2008</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got a great show lined up for this Friday the 29,'08. I have the new Graveyard in and it's wicked, kind of like their fellow countrymen Witchcraft but more '60's sounding. Every song on the album is excellent in it's own right.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on deck is the Black Gasoline and a few cuts from their last album" <em>She Gave Us Magic</em> ", Federale and their cosmic -stoner epics; these guys from Jersey have that down, I tells ya.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other new release that I will be featureing is the ULTRA-SHIT-KICKER, mondo-destructo A Thousand Knives of Fire album called " <em>The Last Train to Scornsville</em> ". It' is brutal. Tune in, you won't regret it!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for all of the feedback for last weeks show, it blows my mind, everytime, I realise someone was listening. The # to call is <em>514-848-7471</em>, use it or ...well...you know...</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yup, the mails been coming in pretty regularly, for a nice change! As promised last week, this week is going to be S M O K I N'. I've got the new Thunder Express ( about 3 months late but you know what they say..." where the f**k is my mothahf**kin' music at bitch " or ..no...wait.." better late than never " ?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to play<em> </em>Robert Dahlqvist's ( ex Hellacopters ) new band Thunder Express from their latest release " <em>Republic Disgrace</em> ". It's a rock 'n' roll treat, has that super-rock vibe of the <em>H</em>ellacopters "<em> By The Grace Of God</em> " release but less camp/cheese and more sing along with it cause you know the words kind of thing..what?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on deck will be some downright wicked Medicine Ball Caravan from their " <em>Crossing the Seas, Spreading the Sins</em>&nbsp;" album. These dirty, filthy, unwashed frenchmen( and woman ), from France, kick it real filthy like. Kind of like Raging Slab..with an accent. Also some very evil sounding Mustasch, another kick-ass band from Sweden and I'll be playing a couple from their " <em>Latest Version of the Truth</em> " release. They sound like across between Sword, Dio, Kiss, and Ratt...now I know that sounds strange to say the least but it's what it is and it kicks hard..you'll see.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, as usual, the # to reach me at the station is <em>514-848-7471</em>. There's a big chance that I'll be broadcasting from the studio this week, so in fact, there will be no phone in option this week, sorry.<br />

<p><strong>Are You F**king Serious, Not Buddy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with a heavy heart that I bring you the news of Buddy Miles' passing through to the other side.&nbsp;George "Buddy" Miles was born&nbsp;in Omaha Nebraska in 1947, this virtuoso drummer was the prodigal son of a bass legend who played with the likes of Duke Ellington and Count Basie.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting his teeth in bands like The Ink Spots, The Delfonics, and the unbelievable Electric Flag, he was a pioneer in the fusion of psycedelic, jazz and blues. I'm bummin'. He showed up as the guest drummer on Jimi Hendrix's ground breaking&nbsp;Electric Ladyland&nbsp;in the song "&nbsp;Rainy Day "&nbsp;and a few others. What happened next in his life was f**kin' magical.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hendrix assembled The Band of Gypsys. Himself, Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. The rest is history..and the future for that matter. Their live album at the Filmore East is brutal..and the Band of Gypsys album? Seriously one of the most important albums of any kind in the last 100 years.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles worked with Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Funkadelic, Carlos Santana...the list is just too huge to get into. To play the drums so distinctively and to be able to sing like he did over it is mind boggeling. I'll miss his freestylin' funkified filth for the rest of my natural life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll be dedicating a full hour of my next show, Friday the 21st of March '08 to this great drummer by playing part of the Filmore East show from '70 and the whole second side of his live show w/Carlos Santana in that dead Hawaiian volcano. 62 is pretty young, even for a guy his size. What a drag, &nbsp;man.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be spinning some awsome <em>Thunder Express</em> from their " <em>Republic Disgrace</em> " release,&nbsp;some <em>Mustasch</em> from their album called " <em>Latest Version of the Truth ",</em> maybe something from <em>Floodstain's</em>wicked " Dreams Make Monsters "&nbsp;release and if you're lucky some sweet tunes from the <em>Medicine </em><em>Ball Caravan</em>&nbsp;album " <em>Crossing the Seas, Spreading the Sins</em> ".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a sad note: Buddy Miles passed on through to the other side on Feb.27th 2008. This is f**king tragic. I'm going to play&nbsp;a whole&nbsp;side of 2 of my favorite albums of his; Live w/Carlos Santana and of course The Band of Gypsys live at the Filmore East. Do I have time for an obit.?<br />

<p><strong>Ace Frehley@Metropolis March 3'08</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O.k., here's the deal. I'm going to tell you a little story right off the bat to make the rest of this review make more sense.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than a few years ago, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss got together for a tour called " The Bad Boys of Kiss ", and subsequently rolled on through Montreal....to the Metropolis. I bought a ticket without hesitation, as did 2 of my buddies that had been huge Kiss fans all&nbsp;of their lives too.....thic 'n' thin, that's the way it goes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Criss played a full set of the most mind stabbingly bad tunes I've almost ever witnessed since his first solo album. The 400 or so fans had pretty much dwindled down to about 150 by the time Ace Hit the stage...with his apparently loosely thrown together band. The volume at which the show started at had, by the end of the first song; driven all but yours truley and his 2 buddies ( Lud, and good 'ol Billy Danjubic respectively ) running for the back of the club. We momentarily escaped the utter onslaught to our auditory systems ( fully in red alert by this time and I have seen some L O U D assesd shows in my day boy ), to the mens room and collectively used like 4 rolls of toilet paper between us to stuff our ears shut. Did I mention how butt-fugly their tour shirt was...man I'll never get that image outta my head but the goose bumps will fade in a sec...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then sauntered back to the front of the stage; there's only the three of us now...nobody else around for 100 sq. feet,&nbsp;and we're&nbsp;asked personally by Ace if he was loud enough, to which we responded...and I quote.." No Ace..turn it up! " . At this point, he turned around to his already almost maxed out rig and turned the f**ker up. This is when, I would say 90% of the club literally up and left. The band was that bad. Cocain is ugly after 30yrs. of abuse.&nbsp;There were like 12 people in the place including the bar staff by the time it was over. We rocked it hard and went home a little dead inside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So..back to present times..&nbsp;last night, March 3rd, 2008&nbsp;at the Metropolis, more than 10 years later..full circled,&nbsp;I get out of a cab and I'm wondering to myself, is Ace going to burn out..or fade away or what. The wonderful Miss Caroline had a juicy pass waiting for me at the guest&nbsp;booth ....thanks Ant, you rock&nbsp;, and I walk in a little apprehensive of how this show might go down. I get a Heine and low and behold, there's Lud. Like old times..all good. We get to our spot, and Ace Hits the stage.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By the 2nd note, I'm looking at Lud and there is an equal look of complete relief, 4 notes later it's a look of pure joy as this god damned rock legend literally got his shit together, hand picked 3 other guys who<em>&nbsp;f**king live</em> his music and ripped the shit out of " Rip It Out ". I always loved hearing 2 Les Pauls at once..it's something. They were bloody loud, but just under the annoying mark. From the same first solo album he then played " Snow Blind " and a cool little medley of " Torpedo Girl " ( from the Kiss ' Unmasked '&nbsp;album )and from his classic solo album, the song " Speedin' Back To My Baby ". I could have easily sat through a full version of the latter( the only disapointing thing that evening), I freakin' love that song.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never&nbsp;liked his later solo albums; they were&nbsp;musically weak...but would you beleive he revised a bunch of those tunes...and they were s o l i d. " Rock Soldiers "," Trouble Walking" ( a song that needs no explanation....whatsoever ), all spruced right the hell up.&nbsp;His solos were note for note and his tones..oh his tones were back like the old days." Shock Me " was sick.&nbsp;Shock you?...shock me! I've seen Kiss with Ace Frehley 5 times, 3 back in the day, and 2 during the Kiss comeback tour. In what, like '96? He was on the money tonight. Did I mention how utterly speechless we were?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the 4th side of Kiss Alive ll, he wailed on " Rocket Ride ", another ingenious little medley of some of his '90's tunes and " Love Gun ". Very crafty and well arranged, this band was kickin' the shit out of the venue and everyone in it( about 400 or so ). He then pulled out one of his many customs and lit the stage and his giutar up( literally)&nbsp;for his&nbsp;N.Y.C. anthem " Back in the New York Groove " and the place went a little nuts. The New York Attitude was oozing out all over the place. Someone threw up a top hat during one of the songs and&nbsp;in true New Yorkese, he says <em>"... I know Slash purrsonally, I just can't fuckin' weh that thing."</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left the stage, only to return with a full Kiss encore set. I felt like a kid in a freakin' candy store. The sweet, sweet sound of " Deuce " rang out like the anthem of an era. '74 New York sleeze'n'roll. The drummer sang the Stanley parts, the bassist sang the Simmons parts to a tee, it was eerie.&nbsp;Kiss was playin' Daisey's and the Coventry and other nasty Jersey /Queens/Amity clubs while down town at Max's Kansas City, The Mercer Arts Center;&nbsp;the Dolls were lovin' over themselves struttin' around, waiting to crash the Kiss party after their show. Frehley along with, Thunders, Ivan Kral( Patti Smith Group ), Lou Reed,Johnny Ramone&nbsp;and&nbsp;a few choice&nbsp;New York guitarists of that time really carved a sleezy, sultry, standoffish,&nbsp;( nihilistic ) niche in one of their city's trademark sounds/styles.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he kicked into " Love Her All I Can ", from&nbsp;Kiss's 2nd release&nbsp;' Dressed To Kill ', I freakin' couldn't believe I could remember all of the lyrics. I would have wept if I wasn't such a hard c**t. Ended it all with the awsome " Cold Gin " with a craftily placed outro to " Black Diamond ". F**king classy all the way down the line. What can I say, I was absolutely as shocked as I was relieved.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sick, filthy, raunchy,&nbsp;(sh)city honky-punk always fit neatly under my skin...I don't know what it is;&nbsp;but I just got a major fix of it and all I want to do is nod off with the songs swimming in my head.....which brings the answer to my earlier question.... will Ace burn out, fade away, or what..well:&nbsp;it's or what, if ' or what '&nbsp;means like a true legend, he will simply rock on.</p>

<p><strong>Black Mountain/ Bon Iver/Feb.29'08</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that when I got my tickets to this show I was all like...this should be a mellow one, considering their style; didn't expect there to even be a lot of people.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...there were. In fact the place was sold right the hell out. I'm so not into a super packed atmosphere...but these guys throw down a really mellow vibe. Pretty subdued crowd..a new pattern/disease of todays youth I guess...!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cutting a slice of life from Montreal early in there North American tour, British Columbia's <em>Black Mountain</em> set their gear up quickly after the opening bands. Got right down to buisness they did. Playing the first 3 songs from their latest album " <em>In The Future</em> ".&nbsp; " Stormy High ", " Angels ", followed by "&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyrants ", as well as " Wucan " , " Queens Will Play ", and " Bright LIghts ". These guys have their work cut out for them: I checked out their tour schedual and these freaks are playing like 13 shows in a row at one point. Gotta like the work ethic!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally caved and bought their latest album last month. You've probably heard me play it these last 3 weeks or so on BTG3. I have to say, these guys/girl bring a tight little package of juicy little nuggets of style that time&nbsp;is not so much forgetting...but avoiding. It's nice to see a bunch of kids groovin' on songs&nbsp;who's moods are inspired by the likes of Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd...and I mean this in a good way; 'cause we've got enough of the straight up rip-off bands out there...snap!. They're not particularily derivative, but have a real knack for throwing down similar vibes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the first song off their new album and set last night; " Stormy High " sounded like a <em>Fu Manchu</em> song, " Angels " could have been a <em>Neil Young</em> song; it&nbsp;had that chillin' on the porch kind of vibe you know? " Queens Will Play " has this&nbsp;eerie <em>Pink Floyd</em> " Umma Gumma "&nbsp;- <em>Jean Michel Jarre</em> quality to it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Evil Ways ", heavy with the keyboards,( with the coolest guitar solo of the night), had a&nbsp; <em>Deep Purple</em> thing going on, predominantly because the guy on keys has his rig sounding like it's going through classic <em>Leslie </em>speakers.. you know the ones that have the spinning cones at the bottom...same as their song " Bright Lights " which also has a very Zeppelinesque stomp to it, ( all from their latest release " <em>In The Future</em> ").<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They got into their less recent repertoire later on in the evening, playing a few from their s/t release from 2005.&nbsp; A couple of rockers, and the end of the night brought on their 2004 effort- " Druganaut ". Like I said...a mellow vibe, nothing to get too excited about, but a tight set that tweeked your musical feelers in a " I'll take 'Songs That Sound Like Other Songs" for $400 Alex " ,&nbsp;kind of way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Bon Iver</em>, well.......let's just say that when&nbsp;me and my mates walked in at the end of their set,&nbsp;they were sitting&nbsp;down..presumably for the duration of their set...and any band that has to sit down to get their groove on well.....that says it all about this " band ".<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, just got back from my annual dvd burning party at John and Bobby's pad. Those worth mentioning; a vintage <em>James Brown</em> concert featuring <em>Bootsy Collins</em> on bass, a wicked <em>Plasmatics</em> documentary with the hottest/biggest collection of live songs from the late great <em>Wendy O.Williams</em>. The piece de resistance: a region 2 version of a <em>Screamin' Jay Hawkins</em> documentary..it is so off the hook.. that it's.. <em>R I D I C U L O U S.</em> Atleast it seemed that way last night, those guys get me so wrecked whenever I drop by, it's scandalous.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, the boys from <em>The Feztones/The</em> <em>Gruesomes</em> have honoured my show..<em>Beyond That Graveyard 3</em>, once again with an advanced copy of their up and coming <em>Fuad and the Feztones&nbsp;</em>cd; their&nbsp;most debaucherous&nbsp;effort to date. Are you ready for this? I have, in my hands ..their brand new album " Beeramid ".

<p><strong>It'll Be a Waylon Good Show</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All right you sorry sacks of dog crap, even though you totally don't deserve it, I'm gonna bring in the hired guns this next <em>Fri. the 15th 2008</em>. I'm talkin' about bringing my sometimes co-host(hort) <em>DJ Robin</em> or as some call him <em>South-Side Robbie,</em> with a possible appearance of <em>LL Von Morrison.</em>If <em>The Vonster</em> actually shows up you guys are in so freakin' deep, even I, can hardly imagine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're going to play atleast an hour, if not 2; of the dirtiest, saddest, most disturbing country tunes this side of Dixie. I ain't gonna lie to you , it'll be brutal and will definately go down a lot easier if your on the brown liquor! <em>Hank Williams, Hank Jr., Hank the 3rd, Waylon Jennings, Shooter Jennings, The Cashes and Marty Robbins, </em>you can see the patern I'm sure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along side those tasty morsels, I'll be throwing down some cool-assed tunes; from stoner rock to screeched to a halt and out the winsheild at 60mph <em>Sepultura </em>(vintage, not the later, watered down crack tunes). Some awsome <em>Valiant Thorr</em>and&nbsp;<em>Superheavygoatass.</em>Weather you tune in for the line danceing or the murderfest, it's all copascetic. People will get hurt and offended, and that's exactly how it's going down. The # to call as always is<em>514-848-7471.</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>There will be a few awsome surprises..one of them ..possibly being the brand new <em>Black Mountain</em> cd...who are by the by playing here in Mtl. on the 29th of this very month. It's<em> R E T A R D E D</em> good. A big ' What the hell is up? ' to <em>Queen Jestah</em> in Nova Scotia...don't slip!</p>

I'm glad y'all liked the covers show..that's pretty much the most positive feedback I've gotten in like the hole year of 2007 and I only had to find about 30 mostly recent covers of specifically '70's songs. I'd be lying if I said I winged that one.<br />

His influence in music and life in general is ingrained in many of the people that were fortunate enough to know him. His spirit truley lives on and you'll all be witness to the wonderful and debaucherous tunes that we used to trip on.<br />

<p><strong>Mongrels Ticket Extraveganza</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey people, as promised, this next <em>Friday the 23 of Nov.'07 </em>I'll be&nbsp;interviewing <em>Steve Ludvik</em>of <em>The Mongrels</em>. He's bringing along a pair of tickets and their brand new long awaited cd&nbsp;to be given away at some point in the interview. This all to promote their show at <em>Club Lambi </em>on the <em>24th of Nov.'07</em>. Totally the show to see; everyone who gets a ticket gets their brand new cd <em>" Oshawa ".</em> Check it out at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mongrelsmtl"><em>www.myspace.com/mongrelsmtl</em></a>, it's freakin' wicked and well worth the wait.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be cool music afoot, especially if I can get <em>Lud</em> to stick around and spin some tunes of his own. He's spun himself quite a rep as a dj the last few years at <em>Casa Del Popolo</em> trading tunes with bandmate<em> Andrew Dickson</em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on deck..the brand spankin' new <em>Monster Magnet</em> release " <em>4-Way-Diablo</em>". There are&nbsp;4 K I L L E R songs on that album that I wasn't sure they( M.M. ) had left in 'em. Just when you thought they were done eh?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So prick up your ears and don't forget the # to call is <em>514-848-</em><em>7471</em>, the one you'll need to call if ya want some<em> Mongrels</em> tickets. For my peeps in Ottaweird, T.O. and the greater Mtl. area, make some time this Fri. and check out the show. You'll love the raging '70's esthetic, it will melt over you like ice cream on a flash fried waffle. SSShhhhmmaaaa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alrighty then, what an awsome show comin' up this Friday the 16th '07. I've got the brand new<em> Mongrels</em> release <em>" Oshawa "</em>&nbsp;. A musical journey of sorts. It has been eagerly awaited by many blown away rock fans that have seen them play with the likes of <em>Blue Cheer</em>, <em>Pagliaero</em>, <em>C'mon</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Illuminati</em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These post '70's sun-saoked, honeysuckle dripping, love visionaries will be destroying the <em>Club Lambi</em> on the <em>24th of</em> <em>November '07</em>. In a good way...and don't I have one of the first copies never to see a store shelf! <em>" Oshawa "</em>&nbsp; is a solid testament, taking it's listeners to the very nether regions&nbsp;of the human auditory orgasm.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will love it and will probably end up taking off your clothes before the album&nbsp;is even&nbsp;over...either that or you'll be a huge new fan : or are already a huge disapointment to your immediate and not so immediate family. There'll also&nbsp;be the usual award winning&nbsp;tonal debauchery you've come to worship.&nbsp;Call in at <em>514-848-7471 </em>and give me your thoughts on it or even just a request, remember your opinion counts.....not!</p>

<p><strong>I Say God Damn... God Damn</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I hope you all took my advice and went to the <em>High On Fire</em> show last Sat. the 12th'07. If you didn't, it could argueably be the dumbest thing you've done this year. It was definately a communion, and I woke up the next morning ( with a heavy head, pun could go either way on this one ) and threw some <em>High On Fire</em> <em>Hotsauce</em> on my homefries. Delicious, and nutricious.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next week I have some cool new tunes for y'all. The new <em>Dax Riggs</em> release <em>' We Sing Of Only Blood Or Love '.</em> <em>Dax Riggs</em>, you know... the <em>Acid Bath</em> guy, frontman for<em> Elephantmen</em>. It's a solid ' solo ' effort and does not sound like the afformentioned bands at all. It's like a cross between<em> P.J. Long</em> from <em>Mule</em> and like an<em> acoustic</em> <em>Jay Mascis,</em> some real <em>country ass kickin' shizzle</em>.&nbsp; Pretty f**king yummy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I'll throw on some wickedly produced and performed <em>stoner-doom</em> from <em>Iron Hearse;</em>&nbsp; kind of Obsessed sounding....oh yeah, is your mouth watering too? No?....well maybe I should get that checked, no...wait... <em>you</em> check <em>your </em>shit out...you ...you fff. The once super rare<em> Floating Goat</em> realease '<em> Heaven's Burning '</em>, it's blazing stoner metal in all of it's glory and guess who's gonna be playin' that for y'all. Yours truely..and they're the one's in the picture.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the phones lines are up again and you can request to your bladders desire,<em> </em>at<em>&nbsp;514-848-7471</em>. If you're callin' from the states or overseas....you know who you are, just hit me on&nbsp;my cell, save your beans, for the love of great Odin's nudsach! See ya'll next week on the 26th of Oct, 2007.&nbsp;Like my pal the <em>Kool-Aid Man</em> says......<em>OOOHHH YEEAAHH!!!</em></p>

<p><strong>HIGH ON FIRE/Mono/Colesium/Panther@Les Saints,Oct.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No tricks....just treats.&nbsp;Celebrating another birthday, we opened with Jaeger and guava juice ( Guansters ) and a few neat tequilas, complements of Cazadores,&nbsp;my crew and I definately&nbsp;set ourselves&nbsp; high on fire, which is no coincidence considering who we were&nbsp;going to see at <em>Les Saints</em>, this cold and wet evening.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived at the club&nbsp;just as&nbsp;<em>Mono </em>started and&nbsp;met <em>Matt Pike</em> standing out front, having&nbsp;a smoke. I told him that I was glad to see him out here and not already on stage with <em>High On Fire</em>. <em>Pike</em> urged us to check out some of the <em>Mono,&nbsp;</em>even though he wasn't. He&nbsp;said that being on a bus with 6 other guys for&nbsp;4 weeks, and the&nbsp;venue being&nbsp;the tiny club ( more like illventilated stanky urine pit ) that it is, he needed to get some air. Game for conversation, this guy is well read and humble, even with&nbsp;his pending&nbsp;sermon featuring lessons in tones, chord construction/destruction, and lessons on commitment,&nbsp;grattitude,&nbsp;and sweet, sweet&nbsp;relief.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>High On Fire</em>, played their 3rd show here in Montreal, supporting their 5th major release, <em>' Death&nbsp;Is This Communion '</em>&nbsp;; it's&nbsp;outstanding and their most definative work to date. This album delivers their wonderful Zen like tsunami of toned and heavily textured debauchery that we all pray for on a daily basis, or is that just me? No... I think you know where I'm coming from.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singer/guitar player <em>Matt Pike</em> and drummer <em>Des Kensell</em>, along with a select few bass players, have really come into their own in the last 9 years. From their first ep to their first major release<em>&nbsp; ' </em>The Art of Self Defence '<em>,</em> they've had critics and writers literally scrambling for adjectives and superlatives, ( for what seemed to be forever&nbsp;) to somehow try and categorise them&nbsp;( as 'they' always do ) unsuccessfully I might add. It 's because&nbsp;the music's&nbsp;pure and basically in and of it's own.&nbsp;They've carved a huge new niche for themselves and everyone around them&nbsp;, it's that simple.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of own, that is exactly what <em>High On Fire</em> did to us, they owned the night. Opening with <em>" Fury Whip&nbsp;"</em>&nbsp;, a scorecher from their latest album, another, the title track from the same release, <em>" Death is This Communion"</em>&nbsp;was juicey with it. They then ripped the ever lovin' shit out of <em>" Eyes and Teeth "</em>from their 2nd album <em>' Surrounded By Theives '</em>. What a heavy piece of work that release is. Then <em>" The Face of Oblivion '</em> from their 3rd album <em>' Blessed Black Wings '</em><em>. </em>Tasty morsel at that. The new bass player <em>Jeff Matz</em>-ex <em>Zeke</em> member, filled in <em>Joe Prestons</em> shoes nicely, absolutely shredded during the intro to<em>" Eyes and Teeth "</em>&nbsp;: a tight fit and different style, he's helped elevate this band even further.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pike</em> then enthusiastically introed <em>" Waste of Tiamat "</em> from <em>' Death is This Communion '. </em>Another piece of birthday cake that barely fit on the plate.&nbsp;Pike, playing a custom guitar with no less than 9 strings; sets up an elaborate musical scape that could cook a steak, hell...a whole freakin' cow!. It is sonically warm; &nbsp;like lying in your crib, riding a solar flash. It's deep in there, even dropping an eastern taste, I guess coming from the Turkish side of his family tree. No surprises that<em>" Rolling Stone "</em>magazine&nbsp;put him in their top 20 guitar players list.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A composer friend of mine was at the show and was very impressed, just having got into the band after <em>' Blessed Black Wings '</em> came out.<em> David</em> went on to describe <em>Pike's</em> playing as tasty and was in awe of his original and technical guitar pyrotechnics: this, coming from a guy who routinely transcribes piano parts from <em>Bach</em>and <em>Chopin</em> into classical guitar, and then rips it out almost flawlessly minutes later.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Pike</em>, not just wanking in a heavy tone, but giving himself totally to the audience in constant bursts of energy as he posts himself at the edge of the stage, grinning...grinning as he sacrifices guitar&nbsp;lick after guitar lick for his minions to revel in. This guys influence in similar&nbsp;musical millieuxs, is already having a positive and instantly decernable ripple effect in the way&nbsp;people are approaching&nbsp;their guitars. The fact that <em>Kensell</em> is favoring his double bass pedal more and more and that it was&nbsp;<em>' Endino '</em> approved, well there's a recipe that's <em>K-man</em> approved......and I can cook with the best of 'em.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's like a <em>Hendrix</em>, or an <em>Iommi</em>, or a <em>Van Halen</em>. He is the guy who people want to play like now. Just when you think it can't get any heavier, it does. They played 3 more&nbsp;from the new <em>' Death is This Communion '</em> album, including <em>" Cyclopian Scape " " Return to Nod "</em> and the most ridiculously heavy song on it , <em>" Rumors of War ".</em>That song is like trying to get a mountain lion into a cold bath without Steve Irvin to help you out. It's a masterpiece, or as I like to say, a mastermess. They finished their onslaught with a superfast version of<em> ' Blessed Black Wings ' </em>first song,<em> " Devolution ".</em> Isn't church like 3 hours or somethin'? Wow, all that in a little over an hour....not so shab.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mono</em> was cute as a button, and reputable forces that night reported to me that <em>Coliseum</em> was extremely tight and fluid for the many changes that they have to navigate through, furious set,&nbsp;and<em> Panther</em>......I got nuthin'<br />

<p><strong>You Can Scream ...But It Really Won't Matter</strong></p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope you dug last weeks show, isn't the new <em>Bionic </em>off the hook? Sorry 'bout the phone line being down, it was actually up, but there wasn't a phone in the broadcast booth for some totally unprofessional and fucked up reason. Hopefully it'll be back up in time for my next live broadcast of <em>Beyond That Graveyard lll</em>, which by the way, will be <em>October 11th,'07</em>. You'll be able to call in and request 'till you puke if you are so inclined.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will have to forgo this weeks show ( <em>Oct.5,'07</em> ), for none other than the fact that <em>David Yow </em>-ex <em>Scratch Acid</em>, <em>Jesus Lizard</em>, is returning to Montreal with his new kick ass band <em>Qui</em>. This will take place at the incomperable ' <em>La Salla Rossa</em> '. What a venue, what a band...what a night it will be. I highly recommend checking this one out, I've seen <em>Yow</em> perform with <em>The Jesus</em> <em>Lizard </em>five times and let me say for the record, they blew doors on anything that was out there at the time. '91 through '97... those&nbsp;were the<em>&nbsp;Lizard </em>years. Do yourself the favor, spend the $14.00 and just go, you can thank me later.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as next weeks show, <em>Fri. the 11th of Oct.'07</em>, I'll be premiering the brand new <em>''Blue Cheer "</em> release, ( just couldn't use the blue font, it makes me ill ). It's appropriately titled ' <em>What Doesn't Kill You</em> '. It's shockingly wicked. You'll see. I will also be slappin' down some old school lollypop vinyl from&nbsp; <em>Acid</em><em>&nbsp;King's&nbsp;</em>'99<em> 'Busse Woods'</em> release as well as the first <em>Brought Low</em> album. It doesn't matter which country you'll be listening from, it will be hell all over this whole month and you're gonna love every minute of it.</p>

<p><strong>Gov't Mule @ Le Nationale, Sept.14 '07</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where to start, where to start. <em>" Gov't Mule " </em>is an off-shoot&nbsp;power trio&nbsp;from the <em>" Allman Brothers Band " </em>that started in '95. Warren Haynes, one of the grittiest, most soulful singers of our time ( not to mention a mesmerizing guitar player) teamed up with the late great Allan Woody, ( one of the few bass legends of any day ), and drum demi-god Matt-the planet of the Abts-Abts. These guys transcend any type of style labels. They are a true fusion of blues, reggae, rock and jazz. I haven't seen these guys play since their show at <em>The Cabaret </em>in '99, the last time Allan Woody ever played in Canada.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his most untimely dimise in 2000, Alan Woody was eventually replaced with present bass player Andy Hess ( ex-<em>Black Crowes </em>) and joining them since 2002, awesome keyboard player Danny Louis.&nbsp;Touring on the heels of &nbsp;their 15th album&nbsp;"&nbsp;<em>High and Mighty</em>&nbsp;" there seemed to be an underlying theme for the night aided buy a whole slew of new songs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>' Mr. High and Mighty ' </em>was one of two songs in particular that perpetuated something that I have believed for years now and have finally been validated by none other than the&nbsp;blues troubarour&nbsp;Warren Haynes himself. If you've read some of my reviews over the past few years, you know my stand on popular and " alternative " music and it's lack of talent therein....<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well here's a quote from Mr.Haynes: " <em>We're at a place in history where the bar is at an all time low. We've applauded mediocrity 'till there is no lower</em> <em>we can go</em>." He goes on further with " <em>There's a generation coming up now, as far as people&nbsp;pursuing&nbsp;entertainment careers, their only goal is to be famous. It's not about being good at what you do, it's about doing what will</em> <em>make you famous, even if it means destroying your integrity</em>." You know how the K-man feels about this, I think that everybody under 35 should look up 3 words in the dictionary: responsibility, accountability, and integrity.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>' Unring the Bell '</em> was another song with similar themes, a smoking reggae tune that dynamically floated in and out of the<em> Beatles' ' Love Me Do'</em>. Another song from&nbsp;<em>" </em><em>High and Mighty "</em>, <em>' Million Miles Fom Yesterday '</em> was smokin' hot and saw Warren Haynes switch from his reverse Firebird to his awsome tobacco flamed Les Paul, and I agree with you Lud, the Les Paul is definatley the guitar he wails on the best. His slide work is second to none. At one point the whole band ( safe for Matt Abts ) picked up Gibson SGs, even the bass player switched from his Fender to an EBO long scale..which gave me an Allan Woody of my own...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I mention that they played for more than 3 hours? These guys are such a jam band, it's almost psychic the way that they interplay with one another, it's downright creepy, borders on the sublime. After playing their <em>1000th</em> show in '04 you start to realise why they're like that. They played a cover of <em>Led Zeppelin's&nbsp;' Livin' Lovin' Maid '</em>, not half as heavy as when they played <em>' No Quarter '</em> last year in T.O..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Mule</em> played some older hits during the second set. They&nbsp;wickedly rolled&nbsp;over their swan song <em>' Mule '</em> from their eponymous album and wailed on <em>' Falling Down ' </em>from the <em>" Life Before Insanity " </em>album. Aahhh...songs about guilt, pain, regret, the solid foundations of real blues. They ended with a few hits&nbsp;including&nbsp;<em>' Soulshining '</em> from their <em>" Deep End Vol.l " </em>album<em> </em>which had the audience singing along once again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louis' keyboard playing put you right up in the comfort zone, like sitting on a cool velvet couch. The drumming was impeccable yet relaxed, what with the bongos and occasional tabla. Would you believe it rained..again?...everytime I see a show here, it rains..freaky. It was definatley a smoke 'em if you got 'em night and they played so many songs ; I just can't remember all of 'em! Who'd have guessed?...Hey...fuck you!</p>

<p><strong>You're So Gonna Get It On September 21st 2007</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; Welly well well, it has been quite a while my fellow music lovers. Been very busy wrapping up the work on my website "kiranskitchen.com" and all of the dvds are now fully available on that site, as well as downloads of all of the recipies for your dining pleasure!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have to leave you with a pre-recorded show this week ( Sept.14'07 ) for I am attending the Gov't Mule show at Le National on Ste.Catherine St.east. The first time I'll see them without the late great Allan Woody freakin' on the bass. I hear that the bass player from the Black Crows will be filling the spot. I think I can live with that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a whole lot of positivity regarding my show on August 24'07. The <em>'Naggin' </em><em>Nimbus' </em>show, featuring the originator of Beyond That Graveyard, my big sister Stephanie. Don't fret, she has promised to guest Dj again in the future. Big up!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You guys are in deep, deep..and I mean D E E P trouble for the next BEYOND THAT GRAVEYARD lll show. I have the brand new "COLISEUM&nbsp;"&nbsp;release&nbsp;'&nbsp;No Salvation&nbsp;' ( who are opening for <em>High On Fire</em> on October 13'07 ). I'll be playing a few tunes off of that one as well as the brand spankin' new " BARONESS " release, ' Red Album '. Both&nbsp;sick in their own right. Both of which I picked up at <em>Soundcentral</em> at their new location on Colonial and Mt.Royal in the heart of the Plateau.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we're really lucky and I get my last order from <em>Stonerock.com</em> by next Friday, I'll also have...are you ready for this? The brand new " Blue Cheer "&nbsp; cd ' What Doesn't Kill You&nbsp;'.&nbsp;Oh yes, you read right kimosabe, it's so down right filthy with the heavy, it's almost unbelievable. Wow, give me a second; that blue font is starting to fuck with my depth perception. You'll also get the full onslaught of a screamin' Beyond That Graveyard lll show as per usual. The wait for another live perfomance from yours truley will certainly be worth it, you better prepare yourselves accordingly, I'm not even kidding, your brains, ears and whatever is left in your bowels&nbsp;<em>will be mine</em>&nbsp; on the 21st of September 2007.</p>

<p><strong>"Beyond That Graveyard! III":</strong> News - <em>Sunday, June 10th, 2007</em></p>
<p><strong>Brant Bjork and the Bros.@ Green Room June 8th '07</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the truth be known, I've been playing&nbsp;Brant Bjork's music on my various radio shows&nbsp;since 1992 and it just boggles my mind at how many albums he's been on,( 30 in 17 yrs.)&nbsp;and the ultimate benchmarks in stoner rock that&nbsp;these albums became&nbsp;just blows my mind. Bjork hails from Palm Desert, California and is the original desert rocker from the days when Kyuss was still Katzenjammer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an original member of Kyuss and played on their first 4 albums: the eponymous release when they were called Sons of Kyuss," Sons of Kyuss "," Wretch "," Blues From The Red Sun " and " Sky Valley " and was replaced by present&nbsp; Bros. drummer extraordinare Alfredo Hernandez for the " ...And The Circus Leaves Town " album. Bjork, all the while founding and playing on the first Fu Manchu album " No One Rides For Free", and subsequently 5 more Fu albums including the&nbsp;" Godzilla&nbsp;" 10" ," Eatin' Dust&nbsp;" ep, the Thin Lizzy cover of ' Jailbreak '&nbsp;and the following albums; " Action Is Go "," King of the Road " and&nbsp;" California crossing". Did I mention his hardcore band De-Con, or Fatso Jetson? Uhh..does Desert Sessions ring a bell? He's on 4 of 'em. How 'bout Che, or Mondo Generator, would you believe Melissa Auf Der Maur? The Operators, 5 solo albums and&nbsp;2 with the Bros. This is what you call a prolific career.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirming the Mtl. gig only 2 days&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to it&nbsp;during their NxNE festval shows in T.O., there was no promotion for the show whatsoever except for my radio&nbsp;show " Beyond That Graveyard lll " and that's just because ...well...I know the right people&nbsp;( thanks T ). Even with no promo they still&nbsp;played to a relatively full and enthused crowd at the Green Room. They wasted no time in cutting the room in half like a wet knife going through a triple layered chocolate cake.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bjork has great guitar instinct, ( not just for a drummer but for any guit. player), and what does a drummer do when he picks up a guitar and needs a drummer, well..he gets one of the best. Alfredo Hernandez, ex-Kyuss/Vic DuMontes' Persona Non Grata/Queens of the Stone Age/Fu Manchu/Orchertro Del Desierto.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This guy is a monster, he has an infinite repertoire of the coolest beats you've ever heard and ...well...not heard, you dig? It is just&nbsp;amazing to see this guy play. The first time I saw&nbsp;Hernandez play was at Foufs with Fu Manchu ( full on barn burner ); second time was at the same venue a few years later in '98 with Queens of the Stone&nbsp;Age( the first time they ever&nbsp;played Montreal, and to this day one of the most amazing musical moments in my life as well as everyone elses that night). A show that ,to this day ,people still&nbsp;talk about like it was a religious awakening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Brant Bjork and the Bros. ripped into' Low Desert Punk ' from Bjork's first solo release " Jalamanta " ( an album which he plays all of the instruments himself, no less ), the bar was set..well... let's just say high..and we'll leave it at that. Tones were thick and full and&nbsp;charged us like a huge zen bull.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lead guit. player known only as Cortez is a solo king and his tones&nbsp;..my god... his tones were like...bubble hash. They were on you, under you,and literally in you. Dylan Roches' bass flowed masterfully in and out of the&nbsp; guitars like melting honey; sweet and fluid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You really understand why people say that they're the closest thing to experiencing Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsys anywhere, ever. Not so much the&nbsp;sound but the physical and mental tones that they lay down. The laid back vibe that tells you not&nbsp;only is everythings gonna be o.k.&nbsp;... it's gonna be great.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short,&nbsp;these guys bring the " cool ", and they finished the show with ' Freaks of Nature ' from their latest release " Somera Sol ", a new anthem for some of us. They keep everyone on the same page from their first note to their last.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropping in on Montreal at the end of a world tour ( 40 shows in 50 days or some such madness ) on such short notice; they played an&nbsp;relatively short set . Brant apologised for the short set later while talking with me and I told him he had nothing to apologise for ( the crowd was positively elated ) and he said they'd be back soon for a full show; the way they played last&nbsp;time they played Mtl.&nbsp;at L'Hemesphere Gauche almost 2 yrs.ago;&nbsp;a 2 hour onslaught that took no prisoners, just left us blown away in our boots ( a friend likened that show to stampedeing elephants).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make no mistake, go and see these guys the next time around and I guarantee that you will see legends&nbsp;at their peek.</p>

<p><strong>DWARVES / Riptides @ Club Lambi May 8,'07</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday night shows are usually a good excuse to have an easy going -early night. Unless you're going to see psycho-punkrock icons the Dwarves at the always intimate Lambi. It's almost impossible to describe these guys. I like to describe them through Dwarves related experiences.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like back in '90 just after they released their 3rd(?) album&nbsp;" Blood,Guts, and Pussy ". My friend just got&nbsp;it and motored to the bus stop to come over and listen to it, you know.. bust shit up. Only he never made it. Some freak at the bus stop saw the cover art, peaking out from&nbsp;under his arm and tried to beat the shit out of him, screaming blasphemy and all that stuff ( who'd think 2 naked women and a naked dwarf covered in blood would insight that kind of reaction! ) but in all fairness, these guys are dirty, filthy, nasty&nbsp;( fuck ) rockers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black corner,&nbsp;hailing from Illinois, fighting out of sunny California,&nbsp;The Dwarves. In the white corner, fighting on home turf from Montreal, in the white diapers...the fans. Deliciously, debaucherously violent, this was a full on barn burner. These boys&nbsp;put the Sub Pop label on the map with their classic '90 release " Blood, Guts and Pussy ".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been around since '85 and have broken every law/rule in the book....and then some..no joke, I'm still amazed that they even made it up into Canada, legally speeking.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blag Dhalia&nbsp;(vocals)&nbsp;was in fine form this evening, ' Detention Girl ' was one of the first punches that landed flush in the face of the audience. Followed by the stiffest set of jabs I've heard live starting with these classic lyrics: "...I'm livin', I'm livin', I'm livin'...in the back seat of my car "&nbsp;from their song ' Back Seat Of My Car ', the second jab came in with there song ' Let's Fuck..', "..&nbsp;I'm the best fucking fuck , in the whole fucking world....." genius, you just can't make shit like that up,.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swift 5 punch combination followed with ' Astro Boy '&nbsp;, ' SFVD ', 3 songs from their&nbsp; album&nbsp;" Come Clean " which were ' River City ',' Come Where The Flavor Is ', and ' Johnny On The Spot '( I think it was ' Johnny On The Spot ', or was it ' I Want You To Die ', honestly I was getting pretty ' punch' drunk.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Going down to the drug store, gonna have me some fun.." was a&nbsp;left hook&nbsp;that sent the audience realing ( the first time that night ), from the song ' Drug Store '. HeWhoCannotBeNamed showed up as usual, wearing nothing but a Mexican wrestlers mask&nbsp;and swinging his guitars headstock ( among other&nbsp;things )&nbsp;at anybody who got close enough to injure. I'm&nbsp;pretty sure&nbsp;it was&nbsp;Vag Amoral in the pocket, but I'm not sure if it was Salt Peter on bass.&nbsp;Their set list opened like a greatest hits list from their album&nbsp;"&nbsp;Blood, Guts and Pussy&nbsp;"&nbsp;,&nbsp;and I think the lead guit. actually was The Fresh Prince of Darkness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These guys have been incorporating a special guest system ,when someone can't cross a border or state line. Including Nick Olivieri and the drummer from KMFDM , Dexter Holland( Offspring ), Black Josh Freese ( the Vandals ), Nash Kato ( Urge Overkill )...the list goes on. People hated these guys for years and now everybodys falling over each other to fill a potential spot...isn't that always the case?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knock out punch came disguised as '&nbsp;Fuck You Up And Get High ' ( an oldie but a goodie ),&nbsp;and the cool ' You Gotta Burn ' from there awsome '97 release " The Dwarves Are Young And Good Looking ", other than that,&nbsp;I honestly cannot remember all of the songs...and that is probably a good thing for a Dwarves show. These guys played a buh-roo-tal set.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the&nbsp;final bell was rung, we picked ourselves off the canvas and&nbsp;our bells had been rung. They swiftly flew off the stage to catch their next bus to the corner of Psycho and Freakass. I feel priviledged to have been punched out by these legends. The Riptides....mmaaaahhhhhh, if they were food I could purge myself like a bulemic, but alas, I can't trow&nbsp;up my brain...or can I?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O.k., back from a recent career bender,&nbsp;I'll be back to shred the airwaves this Friday the 4th of May 2007 with the awsome new realease from Montreal's own Ashtray Heart.&nbsp;Ripping a show&nbsp;recently at Barfly, they had the audience breaking chairs, no less.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll be hearing 2 or 3 of their new tunes including " Hunted Down in Babylon " and " Ugly Winners ". Brilliantly trashy, these guys are like the Mudhoney of Montreal. Checken sie es aus, ya?&nbsp; Alcohol will definately help your experience.<br />

<p><strong>Blue Cheer/An Albatross/Mongrels, April 9,'07</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, a year after their last show here, Blue Cheer rolled up in on La Sala Rosa on Easter Monday. Looks like a lot of the rock'n'rollers were being faithful christians because there were like only 100 or so fans that showed up for the show. That's about a&nbsp;quarter of how many showed up last year.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's too bad because they played&nbsp;an electrifyingly better set than last time. This time, they were&nbsp;all over&nbsp;it. It's as though seeing a small audience lit a fire under their asses, maybe 'cause it's their 40th anniversary touring the globe!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very first notes they played, you could tell they'd come to kick the shit out of us. And that is what they did. Louder than last time, they truely lived up to their reputation for being the loudest band out there. My ears were so beyond just ringing the next day, that I've promised myself that I'm wearin' ear plugs at shows from now on.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Doctor Please ',' Out of Focus ',' Parchment Farm ', '&nbsp;Second Time Around ',&nbsp;were stand outs in their performance. They pretty much played their whole first album " Vincebus Eruptum " and ripped the shit out of Eddie Cochrane's ' Summertime Blues '. Paul Whaley&nbsp;( original B.C. drummer )&nbsp;was beating the shit out of his drums like he was 30 years younger, it was something to see. When you hit the drums as hard as he does, you have to play that loud, it's not really an option.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When MacDonald ( guit ) and Dikie Peterson ( orig.B.C. bassist ) ripped into&nbsp;' 3rd Rock&nbsp;From the Sun '&nbsp;( Jimi Hendrix for those noobs out there )&nbsp;I was in freakin' outerspace. I&nbsp;asked a&nbsp;friend who had seen them in '69, when he was 17 ( who was a little apprehensive about going ) to come and see the show, needless to say, he was so happy that they were back and kicking ass.&nbsp;The&nbsp;70&nbsp;or so people that stayed for their set were totally blown away.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kicking things off that evening&nbsp;were The Mongrels. These guys are quickly becoming&nbsp;heavy-weight contenders on a National level. A veritable supergroup of local musical talent, they tore up the Sala Rosa in fine fashion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp;started as usual with ' City Livin' ', they plowed through ' Set Me Free ', played a new song, only the second time they played it here in Mtl. called&nbsp;' The Answer ', ( awsome tune bye the way ). Followed by their catchy song ' In My Head ', their brand spankin' new song ' Hang Dirty ' was definately the highlight of their solid '70's inspired performance.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They finished with ' Contemplateing the Wizard '.&nbsp;The Mongrels&nbsp;will be heading into the studio this May to record a&nbsp;full album...I can't even tell you how heavy that shit will be. They have been teasing us with a new song almost every show, my inside&nbsp;information has told me they have enough marerial for 2 albums....bbbbrrrrr.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Albatross were unusually sandwiched inbetween 2 bands of a different breed. Should have been called An Atrosity, these guys are of the same ilk as Converge and Dillinger Escape&nbsp;Plan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The music may have died for Don MacClane in the '70's but when annoying became part of&nbsp;alternative mainstream, that's when a little&nbsp;part of it died for me. Disconnected half songs joined by semi-psychedelic keys was hard enough to listen to but when you have someone who only screams completely in-audible lyrics, what the fuck are you supposed to do with that?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could be saying anything, how do you get any credibility when you could be&nbsp;screaming absolute jibberish. Get some talent, put yourself out there and atleast let us hear the words that are coming out of your mouth. Or maybe he&nbsp;screams like that so you can't here lyrics because they suck, grow balls, get talent, stop being annoying.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like we don't have enough racket in the city with all of the construction going on.They were all dressed up pretty swankly though and I guess these days that counts for a lot. Sooo...it's cool to suck now? There are fewer and fewer true mucicians out there that actually, technically know what they are doing, while everybody and their idiot siblings think that they can play. That shit is something you are born with, not something you pick up because you're bored or it's cool. The more the latter type of people are doing it, the shittyer mucic gets, because people who think they can play are idolizing people who can't even play. Morons validating morons, like the movie " Dumb and Dummber "; the blind leading the blind...shut up or I'll kill you ..you follow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To quote a smelly, talentless, fat fuck: " now don't be sad, cause 2 out of 3 ain't bad."</p>

<p><strong>Lindsey Buckingham@ Metropolis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, here's one for you Fleetwood Mac fans out there. Lindsey Buckingham replaced original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green in late '75 with his freak-ass wife Stevie Nicks and forever changed the sound of that band.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tour for his latest release " Under the Skin ", this F.M. veteran has cut himself a niche with his&nbsp;signature&nbsp;sound.&nbsp;A large part of that is of course due to the guitars he uses. Specifically his Rick Turner guits.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This fine evening he played his Rick Turner Model 1, Model 27, and that awsome Renaissance to a less than packed Metropolis. You close your eyes for a second and you'd think you were watching Fleetwood Mac, no shit. Like " Rumors " all over again. An album that brought pop into rock...and into fine elevators across the globe.&nbsp;Except without the coke-head baggage of his ex-Stevie Nicks...thank f**king&nbsp;christ on a cross&nbsp;for that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He played songs from his ever growing solo releases, dating all the way back to 1981's " Second Hand News " album, ( released the 2nd time he "quit" the Mac ). He played ' It Was You ' from his new album. Again, his arrangements&nbsp;are so similar to the Mac, he might as well have done another album with his old band...he probably would have cashed in a little more if you know what I mean.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buckingham then pulled out his Chet Atkins Gibson for a few acoustic tunes, that are usually fully electric songs with a slew of instumentation, which actually sounded good. This guy is by all accounts a very technically accomplished guitarist. He can seriously wail on a&nbsp;6 , 8, and 12 string guitar. No bones about that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Big Love ' was a definate crowd pleaser. I have to say the lyrical content of his new songs draws heavily from his new family and children, to an annoying point. Yes, yes, Lindsey...it's all a rich tapestry, get on with it. I have to say it was subdued...yawn cubed , you dig?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't wait to here him play ' It's O.k. K-man You Paid your dues, You Can Leave Now ', and as soon as he played those first few notes I was history. I'm sure he ripped a few Fleetwood Mac songs for his encore , but alas, I wasn't there anymore. I had to run home and take a shower...wash my recent sins down the drain...you know.</p>

Garland has&nbsp;definately influenced how and what I've listened to for the last 18 yrs. or so, buy playing music and listening to music with him.&nbsp;He is going to give'r a soir chalise. As well as some ' Pelican ', ' Middian ', and some old assed ' Pentagram '. I promise to play some ' Petunia ' and a few country tunes. I will also let you guys in on a H U G E show at " Casa Del Popolo " this May. Tune in or forever walk the line of mediocraty.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A definate" what the f**k is up dudes? " to my listeners in Iowa City, can you believe those 2 new maps? Big up to my peeps in Ottaweird, Steph, Wendy, Dave, little Lumpy Joe&nbsp; and Jimminy yeah..I said it ...Rickety Jimminy Lafreniere and his cousin Jacynth with the patch...yeah you thought I'd forget eh?

<p><strong>B L A C K S A B B A T H/Megadork/Deuch</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;O.k., now..I'm&nbsp;ready. Rainy and windy, a bleedin' Monday night show at the Bell Center no less. I freakin' hate&nbsp;big shows. Exception in point " Heaven and Hell ". I saw these guys when I was in high school for the ' Mob Rules&nbsp;' tour&nbsp;and they kicked ass( I was 14yrs. old and I won't lie to you, a little nervous ). A heavy bridge for young&nbsp;musicians like myself at the time and many others to a world ( and lifetime ) of doomy riffs and chuggy , metal shredding.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;night opened with " Down " and was followed by by Dave Mustanes " Megadeath ", not a big fan of either of these bands. Save the whine for dinner biatch, this is Sabbath night. Apparrantly Sharon Osbourne bought the rights to the name and it's solely reserved for the original lineup. Well,&nbsp;back in the day, Ozzy left&nbsp;" Black Sabbath " and they continued on ( with their name in tact ) ...with some pretty kick ass vocalists, like Ian Gillan ( Deep Purple.. dumb-dumb ), and case in point; Ronnie James Dio ( Rainbow, Dio).&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mercifully missed the first 2 courses of " Merde Souffle" and " Eau de Toilet " .( And I'm not talking about cologne when I say this ). The show started at about 9:00pm. and the crowd was pretty psyched. The&nbsp;Bell Center had about 12 000 fans in it, not bad for voting day on a Monday. I imagined&nbsp;more older fans but was surprised to see a predominately younger crowd. The stage was not as cheesy as I had expected either. It was gothic, but of a stoney church&nbsp;front with very convincing light schemes and a three tier screen in the backdrop ( with some down right creepy images ).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where do I start..I'm pretty sure they started with a new song ( they are releaseing some new material ), it was pretty rockin', they then busted out ' The Mob Rules&nbsp;' ( from that very album )..place went nuts ( in a Monday sort of way, more of a " Woo-Hooo ', than a full on AAAAHHHHHH ), they ripped the shit out of ' Lady Evil&nbsp;' and played a wicked rendition of ' Children of the Sea ' from the "&nbsp;Heaven And Hell " album. The riff that plunges that whole song into doom is so f**king brutal. Axe killings&nbsp;with gold fillings..I always say.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They played ' Voodoo ', a total rock'n'rollah, written in Jamaica by Butler,&nbsp;which was all Vinnie Appice and Geezer Butler thundering down the doom. Iommi absolutely shredded during ' Die Young ', especially on the intro, that guy is seriously one of a kind. A totally tightly played and spooky performence of ' Sign of the Southern Cross '. Did I mention that Dio's voice was not only up to par but he put in an amazing vocal performance ? This guy is ..like..60 years old..unf**king believable. These dudes were all in fine form and I was so relieved. They took this tour as serious as a heart attack, and they carry my total respect for that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' Listen to the ear in the Wind ' and ' The Devil Cryed&nbsp;' ( more new ones ) were heavy and totally doomy, I'm not sure what the song was called but the last ( 3rd ) new song they played sounded like " Earthride " getting out of the wrong side of the bed...no joke, brutaly sludge-doom. Definatley worth further investigation. ' Falling of the Edge of the Universe ' an&nbsp;extended and visually brutal ' Heaven and Hell ' was definately one of my favorites of the night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lights and images were very apptly and artistically executed, classed it up nicely. They looked like they had a great time performing here in Mtl. again with this line up and after 25 years&nbsp;; fans were totally diggin' it. They kicked the shit out of their hit ' Neon Knights ' for their encore and I started to weep&nbsp;openly as I held the banger beside me...( not really&nbsp;), but it was pretty cool to see them again and not to have faded away like so many others in their genre. A total thumbs up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I N T E N S I F Y A H, March 15, 2007</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been a long, long ...long time since I saw a show at the Bar St.Laurent 2, and I have to say it has changed a lot. The last time I was there I think I inadvertantly agreed to smuggle some&nbsp;refugees out of Gahna (Chuck Norris style), in a drunken stuper...needless to say I missed the flight the next morning....which was probably a good thing..There is an actual stage now, go figure! I dragged myself and a handful of friends out to a Thursday night show. The 15th of March, aahh...the ides of March.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes something good to get me out on a weeknight, and I wasn't let down.The band ..." Intensifyah " was booked for 2 sets. One at 10:30p.m. and another at 12:00a.m.. I honestly wasn't going to stay around for a second set but sweet tittyf**kin'&nbsp;Christ&nbsp; were we in for it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex-" Gruesomes " and " Stomp Allstars&nbsp;" bassist John Davis, whipped out another bunch of seasoned pros for this project: Melissa Pipe, ex-" Percy Farm " on baritone sax, Frank the Tranq-ex " Kobayashi ", " Gangsta Politics " on alto sax, John Williams ex-there's just too many to list on- lead guitar, Matt Lober-" Devil Eyes " on rythm guit., and Zen Nakamura-" Devil Eyes " on the skins.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took this band about a minute to start smokin' through an&nbsp;awsome line-up of old reggae hits. Standards, dance hall and even some converted jazz tunes. It was so wacked to here a cover of a George Benson tune...played as reggae.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This cheaky band was full of surprises. Davis' bass sound flooded the&nbsp;stage from the floor up to our craniums&nbsp;like a monsta trucka on a rampage.&nbsp;Bbbrrrahhh rastafari. The lead guit. reminded me of Pat Metheny, (having a whack attack),&nbsp;the horns were a class act all the way through, I can't even get into it. The drummer was down right silly with his snare and kick, a treat to watch as well as hear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand out songs included covers of the " Skatalites " ' Confusious ' and ' Freedom Sounds '. Rythm medleys&nbsp;including bands like&nbsp;" Inner Circle ", Horace Andy, an&nbsp;unbelievable rendition of ' Exodus '( Bob Marley, dummy). They played that song so heavily it was highly, highly Salassi.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Intensifyah " are playing at the Be-Bop&nbsp;on April 7th 2007. I highly recommend you check these guys out if you like a de reggae mon. Do yourself a favor and go, you'll be happy you did. When musicians of this calibre collaborate&nbsp;on a reggae project you know it'll&nbsp;knock'a'rock tha' bummpas! Lord 'o' mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MONGRELS/Adam Brown/Chariots of Shame</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anticipation ran high this week for Saturday night's show down at the Petite Campus.&nbsp;Playing&nbsp;to&nbsp;a packed Silver Dollar&nbsp;house in T.O. with the Illuminati, the Mongrels returned to a full house on home turf.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audience was&nbsp;a big mix of local musicians and ( music ) industry people (raises the odds for a good show), a load of&nbsp;hollywood types, (we'll get to that later...) and a good 'ol blossoming fan base.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mongrels hit the stage at 12:00am (surprise, surprise), and got it on.......on like Donkey Kong. They&nbsp;sounded thick and heavy, loud and chuncky, just like that hairy&nbsp;monkey.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Their vocalist Amy T. belted it out devinely.&nbsp; Regular comparisons to Tina Turrner's (soulful) singing and Joplin's energy,&nbsp;her raw talent is undeniable.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening with the song " Wizard " was a good choice on the bands part. They don't seem to mince about.&nbsp;A wicked rendition as I recall, followed by " In My Head ", an upbeat boogie&nbsp;monster. I still can't get that hook out of my head...the irony. " City Livin' " defined the Mongrels sound and they played it so tightly that you'd think&nbsp;they've been together for 10 years.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ripped out " Set Me Free ", played their new song " The Answer ", a solid addition to their repertoire, " What I Say ", and ended the set with " Talk About Me ". After leaving&nbsp;for a&nbsp;short moment, an enthusiastic crowd coersed them into an encore and they&nbsp;tore into " Need Got Need ". The sound was bassy and brutal, Lud...you are an amp king. All songs rumbled through you like a full body massage, warm and deep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are about to release some of these songs, so look out for that. They've grabbed Stoner-Boogie by the testicles they 'ave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening&nbsp; was a band called Adam Brown. A local band that has fallen into that whole indie "pop"ularity contest. A young bunch with a&nbsp;bit too much&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;;running on less than a full tank of talent, they&nbsp;didn't fool anybody, and if it did, well they soon&nbsp;experienced the real thing a little later&nbsp;with the Mongrels .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative of the Hot Snakes and The Killers, their sound was a little&nbsp;contrived and unoriginal.&nbsp;A member of this band was in a popular Quebec film last year and&nbsp;this drew in the hollywood contingent.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I just&nbsp;never bought it (ever). Here's the formula: music comes first, then everything else, not the other way around. Once the "pop"ularity fades and you're no longer the flavor of the week, good looks and attitude just won't carry you. A few more recordings and some touring might help&nbsp;this otherwise tight band,&nbsp;if they let that girl who plays drums for them sing more, they'll be on the right track..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first band that played that evening was a band called Chariots of Shame. Although I only walked in on their last 2 songs they were heavy. I'd definately check these guys out again. Thick ,edgey and fuzzy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the fact that so many people braved the minus 30 temperatures is proof enough that good music trancends all temperature barriers. The Mongrels turned a green apple week into a peach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>BUCKCHERRY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man.....seriously..I'm going to really have to piece this one together. That evening is spotty at best....but I trust my auto pilot more than most people, so.........Poor ticket sales plagued this show for&nbsp;4 bloody weeks and because of this, the promoters changed the venue for Buckcherry no less than 3 freakin' times. Donne moi une h'ostie casser 'barnak! Keeping that in mind...here's how the evening went down...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's my buddy Mark's b-day night out and&nbsp;another buddy get's the three of us guest listed. We each have a plus one so I call another&nbsp;friend only a few hours before the show...he's in too. O.k., looks like things are coming together. Me,' birthday-boy 'and my 'last minute' buddy, have a few libations (an entire&nbsp;bottle of 12 yr.old scotch )&nbsp;at my pad to warm up for the show.....you know, listened to some 'Blind Dog'..sweet, pungent odors filling up the living room....<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We meet up with 'guest-list buddy' and float down to, yup, Le Nationale...funny thing is, Buckcherry ain't playing there. So we go to L'Olympia ( the&nbsp;2nd&nbsp;switch)&nbsp;and it's....you&nbsp;guessed it.. closed. We're makin' calls on the cells, looking for some local rag to find out where the hell this fore-fucking-saken show is. Apparently,' Les Saints '...where the hell&nbsp;is that?...ohhh, it's the&nbsp;old ' Le Brique '.( Not to be confused with the old 'Brick' on Mnt.St., total debaucherey from another lifetime, 20 yrs. ago for those of you who&nbsp;survived to tell the tales...)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thing is, we left for the show specifically late in order to avoid the first 2 acts, so we're seriously laughing our heads off tryin' to get to this&nbsp;' Le Saints&nbsp;' shithole, before the show is&nbsp;over! We get there and they did indeed start and were on their 3rd song and it's&nbsp;LOUD. O.k., no big deal. We missed their latest hit ' Crazy Bitch 'from their new album" 15 ", no big whoop, it ain't their&nbsp;A material anyway. Did I mention how loud they were?&nbsp; Seriously, ragingly ,wasted as we were we&nbsp;still noticed&nbsp;how loud they&nbsp;were.&nbsp;If you are unfamiliar with Buckcherry, in a nutshell,&nbsp;they're an&nbsp;L.A. band, 110%&nbsp;. Tattoos,&nbsp;messed up hair and cocaine stares...you get it now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lead guit. player (one of the original Buckcherry members) Keith Nelson; played some of the best live slide I've seen in years. This guy had such an impressive rack of axes behind him you'd think he was single handedly fighting the last battle for the survival of rock itself! When he slung on his Zemaitis S24 MT, I pretty much almost crapped myself, and when he reached back and grabbed his Zemaitis International, well let's just say that their was more than just&nbsp;crap in my pants. This guy had like $30 000.00 in&nbsp;guitars behind him. These guys must be pretty&nbsp;huge back&nbsp;in the States...or something...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh Todd,...well he was certainly himself and jeered, snarled, pouted&nbsp;and strutted that night like he owned the place. Great frontman...definately draws in the female contingent..got to love that.' Dead Again' was the song that I wanted to here...they nailed it.&nbsp; Interacting with the&nbsp;crowd&nbsp;sparingly, except&nbsp;for a few&nbsp;jokes about cocain and blow-jobs, they&nbsp;pretty much flew through their entire set in about an hour. The new guitarist, Stevie D.,&nbsp;was also extremely proficient in his playing and had&nbsp;actually had&nbsp;style of his own.&nbsp;They left the stage after playing their anthem&nbsp;' Lit Up&nbsp;' which was sonic to say the least.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're music is&nbsp;high energy, so&nbsp;an hour is&nbsp;totally acceptable in my opinion. Hell, we had a B-day to celebrate anyway. The show was like a ticklish speed bump that evening.&nbsp;That's not to say it sucked, but these guys started out at the 'Whiskey' and are now playing in 3000 and up seaters, their speed; Sunset Blvd., models,&nbsp;strippers, and rails of blow that would choke a whale; technically they should have loved it here in Mtl.&nbsp;but on a Mon. night,&nbsp;a tiny club with the audience looking like they showed up for an exam...if you catch me; the back stage shanannigans were probably something along the lines of- going all the way up to&nbsp;the teachers desk to sharpen your pencil..cause you lost yours-...I don't know. They were 3500 miles from home on a rainy and cold Mon. night. Can't really blame 'em&nbsp;for forgoing an encore...which is, by the way, a priviledge that a crowd has to earn, not something you boo the band for&nbsp;not doing..let's straighten that shit out right fuckin'&nbsp;now folks. I personally would have pulled a GG Allin on that crowd...don't even get me started, but Buckcherry got us started just fine that night. And for those people that we traumatized while&nbsp;boozing our way up St.Laurent St. that night after the show, you pin heads deserved every bit of it, and if I so much as even see you again&nbsp;......but that's a whole other story.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong>C'MON/ MONGRELS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to say that seeing a show at the Main Hall is always a pleasure. One of the few places that can actually mix a drink like it's supposed to be mixed. Also, no matter where you are, you get an unobstructed view of the stage.&nbsp;The menu at hand...none other than Canada's own A list bands. Only the cuttingest of edge for us to feast on this fine evening. Main coarse; Ian Blurton's C'mon with a splendid appetizer called The Mongrels.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mongrels spilled onto the stage like a thick mahogony lacker, bringing colour and class to the whole jernt. Still new as a band, they've taken their show to&nbsp;higher levels with a few&nbsp;new tunes.&nbsp;They opened the set ( if my memory serves me right ) with&nbsp;" Contemplating the Wizard ", then rolled into a new song called&nbsp;" In My Head ", which reminded me of that catchy '70's boogie rock we used to get from bands like Black Oak Arkansas and the like. They ripped into what I do believe to be their first fan fave&nbsp;" City Livin'&nbsp;", followed by " Set Me Free " and then " Talk About Me ".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Amy can belt out a song with the best of them. With a few more shows under their belt (like, 3 since I've seen them last ) they've really come into their own.The energy between Andrew&nbsp;Dickson's guitar playing&nbsp;and Steve&nbsp;Ludvik's&nbsp;thunderous bassing&nbsp;is palpable to say the least. Dripping like juice from a suckling pig on a spit, they played a few more tunes, only to leave us wanting more....what more could you ask, that's how you should leave 'em ..wanting more. Trust me, that's how my old band did it, a definate recipe for sucess. We're all waiting for an album or cd from these guys , I assure you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main coarse consisted of a delicious trio by the name of ' C'mon '. Founded by ex-' Change of Heart ' and ' Blurtonia's&nbsp;'&nbsp;guitarist and vocalist Ian Blurton, who also helps produce a shitload of Canadian bands along the way. Joining him on stage on bass is ex-' Nashville Pussy ' bassist Katie Lynn Cambell and their new drummer Dean Dallas Bentley. These 3 people layed it on thick with their hugely muddy tones ( thanks to their Orange and Green amps ). Playing songs&nbsp;mostly from their ultra&nbsp;creamy " In the Heat of the Moment " album, they fully rocked the house. " This is Yr Captain " is such a heavy song, and " Come Taste the Rock " almost sent the audiece into a frenzy." Gonna Get Some ", well, made&nbsp;you want to do just that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their song " Burn All Night "...well let's just say that we were burning all night. The front of the Main Hall looked like a cafe in the 'Dam if you catch me? Blurton blew his amp about halfway through their set but that didn't stop him from; hooking up with another amp, crowd surfing to the bar,&nbsp;dumping his guitar into the hands of a stunned fan, slamming a drink and surfing back to the stage....a crusty veteran of rock and roll if I've ever seen one....and I've seen a lifetime of 'em. I wasn't to enthused with C'mon when I first saw them like 3 years ago, even the second time I saw them, I always felt like ther was a piece missing, well I think they've found it...in the immortal words of the band ' Thin White Rope'...." ...do right, you doo right, you made a believer outta me.."</p>

<p><strong>ZAPPA PLAYS ZAPPA</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dzweezil Zappa, son of the late great Frank Zappa has gathered a handful of musicians that have played with his father on numerous albums and some highly skilled contemporaries for the hefty task of a full on world tour featuring his fathers music which spanned a career boasting more than 70 recorded albums. These musicians are: Napoleon Murphy Brock-sax, flutes, vocals, Terry Bozio-drums,vocals, Steve Vai-guitars, guitars and guitars, these first 3 guys actually played with Zappa. Aaron Arntz-keyboards, trumpet, moogs, Sheila Gonzalez-sax, flute, keyboards, vocals, Pete Griffin ( Pat Metheny Group )- bass, vocals, Billy Hulting ( Lou Rawls, Patti Labelle )-marimba , percussion and mallets. Jaime Kime-guitars, Joe Traver-drums, vocals and finally Dzweezle himself playing guitar and vocals. All of whom carry degrees from either the Berkely School of Music or SoCal's Northridge, Socal, Chicago School of Music. B.s.c's in jazz and masters in&nbsp;calculus, I could go on....but I think you understand the calibre of sheer musicianship and talent here.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.Z. spent the whole last year locked away in a studio&nbsp;learning &nbsp;how to play some of his father's more memorable tunes. This is how it went down&nbsp;last night, the 23 of October, 2006.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in front of the Metropolis at 5 to 8pm, the show has been sold out for a month and my ticket guy is nowhere in sight. I run into my friend who works for Gillette and he shows me 2 pics. he took of Terry Bozio's drum kit, earlier that afternoon after sound check......I knew then and there that I was in deep. My friend and I are about to spend $160.00 for 2 tickets when&nbsp;my Gillette friend hands me a guest invite. Robin and I split the cost of the one ticket that we buy from&nbsp;a scalper, 2 tickets...$80.00...not bad eh?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening has already begun to bathe in it's own opulant kharma. We bolt into the Metropolis which is already bursting at the seems, I haven't seen it this packed since Fishbone in '94.&nbsp;Just in time to hear the band rip into ' I'm the Slime ' from one of my favorite Zappa albums " Overnight Sensation ". We missed the opening song ' Andy ', from the awsome album " One Size Fits All " ; the surreal ' Inca Roads ' from the same recording was masterfully played a bit&nbsp;later on in the show.. A cold Heineken helps ease me into the undeniable&nbsp;' Peaches En Regalia ' from the legendary " Hot Rats "&nbsp;release. One of Dzweezle's favorites, fully finding that yummy&nbsp;Frank tone from his SG&nbsp;; the crowd listened on in astonishment.&nbsp;' Village of the Sun ' and ' Cheepnis ', taken from " Roxy and Elsewhere " were actuated in such a cozy way it was couchy to say the least. Napoleon Murphy Brock further astounded us with perfect renditions of ' Don't Eat the Yellow Snow ' and ' St.Alfonso's Pancake Breakfast ' taken from the awsome " Apostrophe " album. The marimba work in the later song was so ridiculously flawless you have to wonder if Billy Hulting is in fact, an alien.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Terry Bozio took to the stage they all ripped into ' I'm So Cute ' and had a ball with ' Tryin' to Grow a Chin ', both from the huge " Sheik Yerbouti " record. He took ' Punky's Whip's ' from " Baby Snakes " for a&nbsp;' night out ', I'll tell you that!. Bozio's vocals are only second to his spasticated syncopations and&nbsp;answered the '&nbsp;Does Humour Belong in Music&nbsp;' question with&nbsp;his&nbsp;hilarious hooks and chops.. The band played ' Advance Romance ' from&nbsp;" Bongo Fury "&nbsp;. 3&nbsp;guitarists trading solos with the unbeleivable bass playing of Pete Griffin, this guy is a monster.. he's heavy like water's heavy..and just as fluid.The sax and flute arrangements&nbsp;were so complicated yet mastered in a seemingly effortless way by Brock and Sheila Gonzalez ( who, by the way plays with Billy Preston no less). All the while singing their parts with the timeing of a swiss clock. Brock sweat through 2 shirts by the halfway point, that dude is in sick shape for his age.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Steve Vai entered stage left, the place went&nbsp;fucking berserk. To say he hauls ass when he plays is like saying the Great Pyramids are big. This guy is a titan in music. National Academy of Recording Artists veteran, what can I say, the Zappas know how to pick 'em.&nbsp;When Dzweezle&nbsp;mentioned that the next few songs would be from&nbsp;" Zoot Allures ",&nbsp;( my personal alltime favorite Zappa album&nbsp;)&nbsp;the Metropolis almost split in half. Floor stompin', railing bashing, cheering of the most deafening kind, this, all from a crowd who's average age was&nbsp;like.. 40......what the fuck? ....dude!&nbsp;From that very album, D.Z.&nbsp;and his Stratocaster melted into&nbsp;' Black Napkins ',&nbsp;and fluidly playing the shit out of it; so reminisent of his father&nbsp;that it was&nbsp;down right..eerie...even when they&nbsp;merged into ' The Torture Never Stops&nbsp;'. &nbsp;N.M.Brock sang it just like Uncle Frank...blew my mind, just one more time during that night. When&nbsp;D.Z. finished playing those very 2 songs from " Zoot Allures ", the crowds response ( as well as Steve Vais' )&nbsp;was so enthusiastic and appreciative, he was...well... pretty much overwhelmed. N.M.Brock&nbsp;glanced over at Dzweezle also and gave him one of those " Now do you understand how important your dad was to music, and how his music blows doors on&nbsp;most anything out there&nbsp;" looks. I think he finally, fully realised (right here at the Metropolis ) just how much his father's music&nbsp;was respected&nbsp;especially&nbsp;by&nbsp;the huge Zappa town&nbsp;that Montreal is.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Napoleon Murphy Brock, Steve Vai, and Terry Bozio all played on numerous Zappa projects and their past experiences with the man came through in a huge way when they played those tunes. Their super tight musicianship and all around experiences with&nbsp; Frank&nbsp;trancended any form of critic&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;taste barriers. It's just that simple, they were great.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure there were a few other songs in there, I mean these incredibly talented people played for almost 4 hours....it didn't even seem like 1 hr. to me. They capped off the evening with ' Regyptian Strut&nbsp;' from the " Sleep Dirt "&nbsp;album.&nbsp;Dweezle was so touched by the love in the room, that he left the stage weeping..literally..right after the curtain call. This in turn, and I shit you not..spawned a bunch of weeping around the music hall, 50 yr. olds were losing it left and right. I have never....&nbsp;and I do mean never......&nbsp; ever seen that at a concert before...just when you thought you'd seen everything.&nbsp;Hell, when you're a Zappa fan, you don't just like him , you love him and that's the bottom line...and Zappa fans are pretty freaked out in general...sooo...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dweezle Zappa said they would return and I'm pretty sure they'll be back within the next&nbsp;year. My advice to you, right here, right now is to go and see them; if you loved Frank Zappa, you seriously can't afford to miss them twice. My head was so full of music, and math, mind bending patterns of notes and arangements, and melodys that I was( quite out of character )&nbsp; at a loss for words ...12 hrs. later me still not talk too good.....&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>C E L T I C F R O S T /1349/Sahg</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O.k....first off: I have to admit that I thought this show would either be retardedly heavy or horribly bad. I am&nbsp;glad&nbsp;to report that&nbsp;it was like&nbsp;high doom at the&nbsp;Okay Corral.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show started a little earlier than&nbsp;expected; having cocktails after closing shop&nbsp;at a&nbsp;friends music store, we warmed up with the new' Slayer 'album and some' Entombed'.(Two more bands that obviously listened to Celtic Frost). By the time we left Soundcentral and walked the 3 blocks to The Medley we'd already missed Sahg and half of '1349' 's set.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources&nbsp;(Zelig;dudes seen as many shows as I have!) said 'Sahg' was tight and stoner-like, he bought their cd. I'll make it a point to see them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking in on '1349' just tearing the shit out of the venue was like walking in on the 'Apocalypse' itself. In a nutshell: I walk in and the&nbsp;first thing I see is one of Mtls. finest in front of the consession stand: pig in blue, hands clapped over his filthy piglet ears,face contorted with fear and wonder (but mostly fear). We secured a vantage point to see better, I turn around and in that short minute, the big bad wolf&nbsp;had blown&nbsp;the little pig right out the front door. The brutality was real, as was&nbsp;their conviction.( makeup aside...&nbsp;these guys were seriously packin' matches for some midnight church burnings...no joke). They were dripping with it folks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't throw the word&nbsp;icon around, it&nbsp;can seem a little dramatic. 'Celtic Frost' however are just that;icons of their genre. They are the pioneers of&nbsp;Doom,Death,Black and Speed Metal. I remember going to 'Rock en Stock' as a teenager, like '83,'84,'85 and picking up 'Possessed', 'Corrosion of Conformity', 'Venom'..you get the picture, and one of the albums that stood out the most had this cool H.R. Giger painting on it. The album (of course) was "To Mega Therion". My buddy picked it up on one of those visits, I think I bought the "Die,Die My Darling" e.p. that time. Let's just say&nbsp;"To Mega Therion" changed a few things for us that weekend. When they came to Montreal to play the " World War III " metal show in '85, with Voi Vod and Possessed, so did this cities perception of what ' metal ' could be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh...to dine with the Divine, Sat.the 16th,2006 was a good day to die.Tom G. (Warrior) Fischer (guit./vox), Eric Ain (bass), and Reed St.Mark (drums) were all there just like they were 17 years ago, with a more than adequate 2nd guit.player. (I used to listen to them for their fast thrashy parts but was quickly reminded of just how slow and doomy they really are.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These guys influenced everybody from 'Slayer',to 'Obituary', to the 'Melvins',to bands like 'Sepultura', 'Fantomas ', 'Earthride'&nbsp;and&nbsp;'1349' and&nbsp;pretty much all of the&nbsp;Norwiegen black metal bands.The list could literally go on forever.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fischer and Ain were in another band called 'Hellhammer'...in '81 or thereabouts: legend has it that Warrior&nbsp;got back to Switzerland from a British metal festival featuring 'Venom' and the light went on for 'ol Fischer.The birth of Celtic frost.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is histroy...and we heard history.&nbsp;They tore&nbsp;through their 1st release,'84's "Morbid Tales" including the show opener 'Approcreation of the Wicked','Emperor's Return','Dance Macabre' and their insane closer&nbsp;that night ,'Into the Crypts of Rays'. Almost all of&nbsp; '85's "To Mega Therion",including 'Jewel Throne','Necromantical Screams',the devastating 'Circle of Tyrants',(everything but 'Endless Summer' ). 'Mesmerized' from their later album&nbsp;" Into the Pandemonium ".They mercifully avoided their material from their&nbsp;hair farming era (late'80's,early '90's), only to blow us away with numbing songs from their new&nbsp;album called "Monotheist". Which is pretty bloody heavy at that. Super heavy,&nbsp;best Doom&nbsp;Metal I've seen/heard in a long...long time.<br />

<p><strong>M A S T O D O N /Converge/ the Bronx</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;W O W ....seriously...you guys...uhg..seriously. Did you get the licence plate on that&nbsp;aircraft carrier&nbsp;that just&nbsp;steamed on up through the Spectrum last night? Do&nbsp;aircraft carriers&nbsp;actually have licence plates? Who cares, it's a moot question, because we're talking about&nbsp; behemoths here......right now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bronx, ( who opened for High on Fire the last time those guys rocked through Montreal ), had a less than lack-lustered performance,which was funny because they brutalized us the last time they played here.Oh well,you can't kill every night!&nbsp;Although I missed Converge, Shawn (from Soundcentral Music store) reported them to have&nbsp;lobotomized all but a few in their sporatic wake,frenetic and crisp.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mastodon oh Mastodon, I love you in my brain. It was too perfect to finally see these guys live and headlining at that. The Spectrum always had a soft spot for metal bands, right from the start; from Kreator to Dead Brain Cells, from Voi Vod to Slayer (do you remember that Slayer show? The Seasons tour..they played that whole album in 20 mins.!) Ahh, sweet memories.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choosing a select set from their small discography must have been a job in itself, when you don't really have anything but A material. A bands' natural nightmare I'm sure. Hearing ' Shadows that Move ' from their first major release " Lifesblood ",&nbsp;was tasty and when those first few notes of ' March of the Fire Ants ' from "&nbsp;Remission " rang clear,they&nbsp;almost brought the house down right then and there. Brann Dailor (drummer) is a god amongst insects.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expecting nothing less than perfect sound from the club that's famous for just that, I was immediatley concerned with the lack of bass coming out of the P.A.. Mercifully, the sound man got a handle on that after about five songs. Much to Troy Sanders relief, just in time to here an excellent rendition of Sheena Eastons' ' Morning Train '.....not!! Actually, just in time for an unbeleivable version of ' I Am Ahab ' pulled from their ridiculously heavy " Leviathan " album.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tighter than Nancy Reagan's ass, they ripped through a few tasty morsels from their&nbsp;new album " Blood Mountain&nbsp;"&nbsp;, including ' Capillarian Crest ', ' Circle Cysquatch ', and ' Crystal Skull ".The intricacies that their two guitar players were bouncing between were&nbsp;elateingly mind bogggeling, ( Brent Hinds is one of my favorite guitar players out there right now ) only to leave the stage with their anthem ' Blood and Thunder '( also from "Leviathan "), Bill Kelliher has&nbsp;sick tone&nbsp;and that's all I'm going to say about that! We&nbsp;( the audience )lost it ( just a little ) after the last song and it wasn't but a few short minutes that they returned to play&nbsp;' Hearts&nbsp;Alive ' for the encore.They had me seeing angels by the end of the night&nbsp;.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;ran into Brent Hinds after the show; some disturbing news ...apparently he'd been arrested a few nights ago in god damned Boston(it had to have been in&nbsp;Woostah, I fucking hate Worcestershire)and is awaiting a&nbsp;pending drug charge. He's convinced that this was the last time we'd see Mastodon in Canada. I then&nbsp;immediately handed him some of Montreal's finest and informed him&nbsp;of the&nbsp;specific forms he could fill out at the border, for just that reason..(it's a reacurring problem where whole bands are punished for one persons actions and these forms are there to temporarily grant him travel over borders to avoid&nbsp;just that)...been there,done that.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the next time you see Mastodon in Canada; you fuckers should thank the K-man, 'cause...yeah...I'm all that! Jesus,Allah,and Count Chochula ain't got shit on me!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BLUE CHEER,WITCH,THE MONGRELS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh man,when my ex-bandmate Steve 'Lud' Ludvik told me a month ago that he and his new bandmates The Mongrels were going to open up for Blue Cheer,I almost fell over.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh the lovely Sala Rosa,the beers were flowin' as the love was growin';people were running into each other for the first time in 8-10-15 years.We really came out of the woodwork for this one.Emotions&nbsp;ran deep,no way of getting around that one on this humid June 29th.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lud,(ex Jack Boot and the Oppressors-Blood Sausage)playing bass and Tricky Woo's&nbsp;Andrew Dickson(guit),Bionic's drummer Tim McGuire,Soft Canyon's drummer Jason and their raucus singer Amy got together a set in just 20 days.(I'm talking from scratch here people.)&nbsp;What better place than the often intimate La Sala Rosa.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mongrels wasted no time in getting right down to business.(A reacuring theme that night).Their first song " City Livin' " was too heavy for words and warmed up their vintage Ampegs nicely.The bass and guitars were steak-heavy and with 2 drummers,yeow,a trip on a bombastic level.Nearing the end of their 1/2 hr.set the song " Talk About Me " solidified the bands intent and definately earned them the following that they undoubtably attained that night.'70's balls out rock with a front-woman that belted it out like I have rarely experienced live before;look forward to their next show in August and an upcomming release in September.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next up was Witch featuring Jay Mascis(Dinosaur Jr.)&nbsp;on the drums.With riffs fueled by an early'70's esthetic,the bands music was trance-enducing but I must say the singing had like a '60's pop sound a la Strawberry Alarm Clock (you follow?).Quite a strange mix of styles but heavy hooks made them more that bearable.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tearing a whole out of 1968 (what a year),Blue Cheer rocked it louder and harder than anyone else in San Francisco and most anywhere else in the world for that matter.They are pretty much the fathers of stoner-rock/metal,with their unbelievably loud and fast blues based fusion.To stand in a room and to hear Dickie Peterson(bass),Paul Whaley(drums)and their latest guitar player Andrew'Duck'MacDonald was to breakfast with champions and by breakfast I mean drink booze with.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ripping into " Out of Focus " from their first mind blowing&nbsp;album released in '68," Vincebus Eruptum " they established the full attention from the crowd.When that very songs intro brokeout with those 12 or so lonely guitar&nbsp;notes I knew that La Sala Rosa would never be the same.Tone kings from the age of the dinosaurs,they rattled our nose,jaw,guts and toes.The sheer rumbling and relentlessness of the bassline in their song " Doctor Please " alone was worth the ticket price." I need your painkiller doc,and I need it right away! "&nbsp;wailed Peterson,at which point I bee-lined it for the bar for a little painkiller of my own...yup,you know me all too well,my 'ol friend Wild Turkey,(and Marie-Lynne,you pour a mean drink babe).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan favorites like the Eddie Cochrane classic "&nbsp;Summertime Blues " and " Babylon "(both from their 2nd release,'69's" Outsideinside ") as well as a tribute to their old friend Jim Morrison&nbsp;, " Roadhouse Blues "; were played flawlessly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 60 yr.old plus guys have been rocking the very fringe of our society for almost 40 years;from the free spirited rock festivals of the late '60's and '70's,to biker rallys,to bars in Hamburg Germany's infamous Reeperbahn district.Recording their shows is encouraged,how cool is that?A quote from their song "Gypsy Ball&nbsp;"sums up the evening well..."Lost in a haze of liquid smoke,I thought my brains were gonna choke.Holding the sights I could not tell,under gypsy wizards spell"...word bitches!</p>

<p><strong>Diamand Sea/Famous Lovers/SUPER/HEATER</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,I haven't been to the Barfly in a few years,gotta say,I only go there for the shows now but it was great to pass by the 'ol watering hole.See a bunch of faces from the past,yadda,yadda...it was all a rich tapestry,indeed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedualed to play second on the bill that night,I was stoked to see how anxious Super/Heater was to get it going on.I get to the bar and Robot(bass player), Miss.E(guitar)and Sgt.Omar(drums)were all just itching to play.I have to say,the "let's do this shit"attitude is refreshing to see these days what with this&nbsp;apethy trend in todays young bands.I like that right off the bat.Screw this bullshit,let's get it on.My peeps were all up in that shit,yo!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All playing their different parts methodically,they ease into thier tunes seperately,then melt together quite intensely.They don't mince words either...at all.They remind me of Swerve Driver only less '90's and more "We're going to play seeee...and your going to like it, seee."(said in that classic James Cagney voice).You don't have to worry about lyrics and being turned on or off by them...it's all about the music,....ride the bus bitches.Like a good piece of bitter chocholate with booze in it,they're an evening closer.Which is why when they finished their set first,the 50 plus crowd pretty much got their musical fix for the evening,unfortunate for the next bands..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next up were the Famous Lovers.Hair by Flock of Seagulls,fashion by..Billy Squire/Tom Selleck..I'm still not sure,and sound...well,like the Stranglers on a real heroin/pixie stick&nbsp;bender .Lyrics...I really couldn't tell you,I was still too stunned and amused by their look.Variety show nightmare......where's the roller rink Spock?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly,Diamond Sea.Hmmm...good on their instruments,a kind of "after school special" sound,I guess there is a niche for that somewhere..but at the Barfly?That's like Marry Poppins giving a&nbsp;personal hygene puppet show at Pelican Island.Kind of S Club Seven meets a bucket of Dilaudid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Super/Heater..you need to be a little more selective with whom you choose to grace with your dealeo...you dig?Hook it up with Squalor or somethin' more your speed.These bitches are fresh yo,if you're looking for a stoner rock fix,check&nbsp;'em out at the Main Hall(5390 St.Laurent&nbsp;Blvd.)on June 28th,you can get your tickets at Cheap Thrills.Do it...do it.</p>

<p><strong>WOLFMOTHER/Psychic Ills</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find myself back at the National,a dusty old theatre in the east end of the city.Strangely enough,it's raining(just like the&nbsp;first/last time I was here).This venue has&nbsp;refreshingly fairly priced refreshments...say that 10 times without f*****g it up and I'll give you money!.Psychic Ills just got off the stage,judging by the reaction of this eclectic,iPod inspired audience,they didn't suck.I actually noticed that their merch table was busy as hell,even after the whole spectacle ended.What can I say,I missed the opening band...again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest Aussie export Wolfmother(great name);attendance mostly generated by the iPod commercial,packed the theatre.Hey,they were on a commercial...they can't suck....?If you failed to live the sarcasm in that last sentence then&nbsp;you need to leave my site and never return.Not to say Wolfmother sucked either.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,they opened their show with that very tune from the commercial;Dimension.A good tune ,the singer sounds like Ozzy (and Tommy Shaw but we'll get to that in a second)&nbsp;and the arrangement of the song is highly Sabbathesque.Many of their songs were.The singer,Andrew Stockdale&nbsp;is&nbsp;a 20yr.old&nbsp;"&nbsp;'70's guy"; keepin' it real'70's style..yo..Pulling no less than all of Freddy Mercury's moves,most of Phil Lynott's,a couple of Jim Morrison's,a few Paul Stanley's and a Nadia Comininchy.,and some totally hilarious ones of his own,it was hard not to laugh, but keep in mind ,he's also playing the only guitar in this,a trio and his soloing is solid.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...and we laughed,until they rolled into what I thought at first to be a cover of that glass exploding,scrotum shriveling&nbsp;song from Styx...Lorily.I almost&nbsp;literally had to beat the s**t&nbsp;out of someone,randomly,of course.That guitar player listened to Styx....way.....too..... much.Personally,any Styx is too much Styx,but let's not get catty.<br />
Playing bass,Chris Ross,&nbsp;a bit of a phenom,( I'm not just saying that because he plays the exact same bass as I sometimes do,a'76 Rick 4001 series)but the&nbsp;dude was pulling a Geddy Lee and playing Greg Lake(E.L.P.for those of you who suck)&nbsp;like riffs on an organ while playing his bass..simultaniously here people,I not making this up,I mean come on,that's something.<br />
Myles Haskett,their drummer,on the other side of things,hit like a wee child.The drums were&nbsp;heavily miced&nbsp;;to no avail.You&nbsp;still had a hard time dealing with his week attack.I've heard&nbsp;children make more noise folding&nbsp;origami.Every song ended with a 3 minute outro where buddy would stand&nbsp;infront of the drum riser lights,back to the crowd,looking up at some invisible&nbsp;entity and pose&nbsp;the&nbsp;ever burning&nbsp;Rock'n'Roll question,"Are you there god?..it's me...stupid",again and again.Honestly me and my friends were in stiches the whole night through.<br />
Season this band with another&nbsp;couple of years of playing, another recording,a few back injuries,drug issues,some life trauma,and I think they'll&nbsp;evolve into&nbsp;something less derivative of their musical heros and stand out on their very own(like real men...)In a nut shell,they sound like&nbsp;Jack White&nbsp;meets Atomic Bitchwax meets&nbsp;Sabbath meets Bill Gates meets Deep Purple meets Styx.Take that as you will,I was definitely entertained by a hilarious yet tight and retro-heavy&nbsp;80 minute set.Check 'em out,good driving music.</p>

<p><strong>I S I S/Mare</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April 26,2006 and I get to finally see a show at le National.Opposite Beaudry metro I'm deep,deep in the village now.It's raining and me and my boys are hungry.We hit this cool little Vietnamese place just east of the venue; the authenticity of this place is mind boggling(right down to the music).It turns out to be a classic sake night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spill out of the restaurant and into le National just as the opening acts are done.The founder and owner of Alien 8 records informs me that we didn't miss much,the opening bands did their best...yadda,yadda,yadda.The time for&nbsp;Isis is nigh so we get the drink situation cleared up a.s.a.p. and find ourselves a good spot on the wierdly slanted floor of this ancient theatre.This is the 3rd time they have played here and the first show they ever played anywhere was Quebec&nbsp;City (not Boston,go figure).So,needless to say,these five dudes from Boston have a certain affinity towards us Quebs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lights go down and the show starts off nice and slow,the place is pretty much sold out and the floor space is tight.By their first&nbsp;crescendo the crowd is weaving back and forth as one (you could cut the cheese factor with a bloody knife at this point,in a gouda way).The tunes are spacey and the playing is fluid and they are sounding just like their cds;polished and tight.With a keyboard player that switches to a guitar every few songs,you gotta love hearing three guitars doing their thing all at once.The layering was thick and rich.They break heavy and heads start to bob in that classic headbanger way.I'm living it(a little).All I'm thinking,they&nbsp;better play that song that I like so much,In Fiction,and low and behold,they play it.I'm good for the night.Isis.... good,sake....good,the meat....was good.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to say though,these guys from Isis have to stop contorting on stage as they do,they all had the same basic move on stage:that of someone dying of a migraine,you know what I mean?Weaving back and forth like they just can't shake it off.....they looked a little like the&nbsp;Blue Man Group,and somebody was gonna get covered in paint.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They create atmosphere,then drive it home in a heavy way.I liked this show and those guys&nbsp;are a talent together that will probably get better before worse,I expect good things for them in the future,and they are definitely worth going to see live.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SUPERSUCKERS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gotta say,right off the bat,these guys are always better the first time you see them.I saw them in '93 was it?They were a lot more punk rock,you know that whole cow-punk dealio,all guitar and even more attitude.Now it was April 23,2006.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That being said,a clean and sober Eddie Spaghetti started the show with a few acoustic country tunes which included the Johnny Cash classic "Cocaine Blues",which,by the way,you can find on&nbsp;Spag's new country album.They then proceeded to play mostly songs from their latest release,decent .A few oldies came out in the end.They had thier pattented choreography down as usual,and the soloing was typically good,but I have to say,the magic had faded for me.Eddie had mellowed out to the point of not even insulting the crowd once......not even once?!....I know!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure first timers were stoked and the crowds' response reflected just that.I did find another way to amuse myself,like having a "spot the boob with the&nbsp;stupidest hat in the room"competition with my friends Mark and Robin.They all won,because urban cowboys always made me laugh,I think I actually pissed myself.....a little.</p>

<p><strong>JOHNNY WINTER/David Gogo</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missing my Friday night show is something I hated&nbsp;&nbsp;to do but hell,when a blues legend stops in Montreal&nbsp;for what might be his last time,I make the exception.The night before my B-day and I thought what better way to&nbsp;slip past another year.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Medley was packed to the rafters(literally)on the 21st of April 2006.Why?A legend was about to kick some blues the old fashioned way;with grit,intent,balls,and lament,oh,and did I mention talent?After shelving his rock phase&nbsp;of the '70's it was all about the blues during this performance.Five minute standing ovation aside, Winter bled through the Ray Charles classic"Black Cat",steamed through "Guitar Player" stomped his way through his tribute to his idol and #1 fan,Muddy Waters.The song?"Hoochie Coochie Man"no less.What a treat,he was adement in his love for Canadians,repeatedly saying so after each thunderous outburst of cheering.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ended the show with an encore fit for the guitar he played it on,(an original 1963 Gibson Firebird),he played"Highway 61".Playing the whole show seated at an obviously hard 61 years of age,and almost blind,he proved that he helped invent the blues by ripping note after note of the most fluid and at times quickest playing I've ever experienced live,kiddies.After winning Grammy awards for both producing albums(Muddy Waters),and writing his own music you can see why when you here him wail.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fans cheered for a full 15 minutes after the house lights went on.Which is about as long as it took to leave the jernt,even after&nbsp;not having checked my coat.The experience made me forget the opening act which was David Gogo,and after listening to&nbsp;the last few songs he played,I'm sure it's a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>B L O W F L Y/Definitive Jux/Tony Ezzy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welly, welly, well, well. Blowfly at large in good 'ol Montreal. After the huge article in one of our fine cities ass rags I expected to not even get a ticket to this legendary funk masters show on that very night. A friend and I almost panicked and ran down to the P'tit Cafe Campus about 2 hrs.before the show to see if we could get a few tickets.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only were there a load of tickets left but the only other people in the club were none other than the only two other people besides me that actually owned original 1970's Blowfly albums (that I knew). They&nbsp;actually had permission to film the entire show.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After talking to the 2nd act; a dude from the Definitive Jux crew, we decided to have a few warm-up drinks at a local dive, seeing as the P'tit Campus only sells one type of beer.....( all night), (which is probably a big reason why only about 70 people showed up).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, we returned just in time to see Tony Ezzy, the first act. I&nbsp;would describe the band as the worlds funkiest, hippest (?) wedding band. Baddass flute-conga player, awesome ninja clad guitar player,Tony E in fine form as a mental keyboardist. Then came the Definative Jux guy. Wicked social and political comentary, like I have rarely seen, NYC style to the hilt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sausage party was in full swing for Blowfly.There were only 5 women including the barmaid in the whole jernt, but then again, what self respecting woman would show up to this guy's show? Clad in his trademark Blowfly hero suit and looking to offend, he wasted no time in picking on the only four women in front of him. He was met with the finger most of the time but they all pretty much played along for the sake of the show (those four women were the real heros that night).&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp;and his unbelievably tight bandmates ripped through many of his hits, which spanned his 50 year career. He even sang&nbsp;his song,the first "rap" song ever written. Would you believe in 1959, it sold 900&nbsp;000 copies in Germany alone? Too Fat To F**K, Whole Man, Blowfly vs. Darth Vader, The Word Game, Porno Freak, Blowfly's Abc's, The Booty Bus, Blowfly For President, were among the best in his funky performance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I mention how unbelievably amazing his band was?Rap, soul, blues/metal and funk, all fine traits in his musical tastes; that helped him make bands like Parliament/Parliament , Funkadelic/P-Funk Allstars, George Clinton, Bootsy Collins and The Horny Horns (to list a few) become the legends they became. Ahhhhh, to be twelve years old again, thanks Blowfly, K-man</p>

<p><strong>High On Fire/The Bronx/Big Business/Buried Inside</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Mama Luccia, oww, unngghh. If you were at La Sala Rosa last Tues. the 7th of Feb.&nbsp;you know what I mean. Playing in bands for years, going to shows, playing shows, promoting shows, working in radio for 11 years, I've been to on average 2 shows a week, for about 20 years or so, that's about 1500 shows (3500 bands,conservativlely)&nbsp;give or take.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This show is right up there with the classics. All 4 bands were all about ripping us a new one. Unfortunately my pre-show ho-down brought me to the show just as Buried&nbsp;Inside finished. Reputable forces that night assured me that they played heavy-Isis syle, only juicyer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Business played next. Now the rythm section for the ever evolving Melvins lineup, this was a classic drum and bass jam. Cody Willis (Murder City Devils drummer) smashed nicely along with bassist Jared Warren. Then came The Bronx, ironically from L.A., they kicked it hard, with an unbelievably hyper delivery, they reminded me of Cali's Suicidal Tendencies, England's Discharge and the hardcore bottom of New York's Cro Mags and Ramones. A wonderful appetizer for what was next witnessed (or perpetrated depending on how you look at it).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Pike, (ex Sleep Guitarist), Des Kensel on drums, Joe Preston (ex Thrones/Melvins) bassist and about 400 or so Montrealers boarded a train to the corner of&nbsp;F*****G and McHeavy. God damnit, train-wreak guitars, monster bass chords pounding and speaking of pounding, Des Kensel sounded like the Twin Towers coming down. Mmmmmmmm, High On Fire. When the train&nbsp;arrived back&nbsp;at La Sala Rosa&nbsp;it felt like a crime scene and everybody had gotten away with it (if you know what I mean).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the abyss of todays metal it's always refreshing to see that you don't have to rely on derivative riffs, old dogs,(if yo will), when you have a&nbsp;band like High On Fire&nbsp;that explores the finite vistas of music&nbsp;with infinite ideas. My friends and I left the show with the distinct taste of victory, like you just got into a mental fight...and won, you know what I mean? Later,K-man</p>
