<p>Author: LOURDES FERNANDEZ Herald Staff Writer
<p>Cuban historian and statesman Carlos Marquez Sterling, whose leadership
brought about Cuba's most progressive constitution, died of heart failure
Friday afternoon at his Miami home. He was 92.
<p>In 1940, Marquez Sterling led 76 delegates in drafting a new constitution,
considered the most sweeping of its time.
<p>"To Cubans, on the island or in exile, we can all mourn someone who
was one of the greatest Cuban figures and Cuban leaders of the 20th Century,"
said Mitch Maidique, president of Florida International University, where
Marquez Sterling taught as a visiting professor.
<p>Marquez Sterling had lived in Miami for the past 12 years, teaching
and writing books. His mind was said to be sharp as ever, even days before
his death, as he held long after-dinner discussions on Cuba, politics,
movies and other topics.
<p>His last book, published in 1988, was an account of the life of his
father, Manuel Marquez Sterling, journalist, diplomat and author. Carlos
Marquez Sterling wrote 20 books, including biographies of Cuban patriot
Jose Marti and histories on Cuba and the United States.
<p>But perhaps his greatest accomplishment was the 1940 constitutional
convention, which lasted six months and resulted in a document with 19
chapters, 32 sections and 286 subsections -- a giant compared to the U.S.
Constitution.
<p>The 1940 constitution recognized all Cubans as equal, called for the
breakup of large land holdings, granted citizens the right to work, established
alimony and child support, and gave legal rights to illegitimate children
and unmarried couples who lived together.
<p>"It was our success that corrected many of Cuba's social problems,"
Marquez Sterling once said.
<p>The previous constitution had been written in 1901 under the approval
of the U.S. government.
<p>Before the 1940 convention, and certainly afterward, Marquez Sterling
was well known throughout the island. Before he was tapped to head the
convention, Marquez Sterling was a lawyer and a professor of economics
and law at the University of Havana.
<p>He returned to his law practice and to teaching after the convention.
He also founded the Manuel Marquez Sterling Professional School of Journalism
and served as speaker of the House of Representatives, as minister of state
and as minister of education.
<p>In November 1958, he unsuccessfully ran for president against Andres
Rivero Aguero -- a candidate backed by dictator Fulgencio Batista -- and
former president Ramon Grau San Martin. The constitution that Marquez Sterling
had helped to forge was being disregarded by Batista's government, spurring
Marquez Sterling to run. The next year, after the new Castro government
placed him under house arrest, Marquez Sterling fled Cuba.
<p>He went to New York, where he taught at Columbia University and C.W.
Post College on Long Island. He retired to Miami in 1979. Here, he taught
at Biscayne College, now St. Thomas University, and wrote columns for the
Spanish-language newspaper Diario Las Americas.
<p>In 1984, the Florida House of Representatives honored Marquez Sterling
for his contribution to "Cuba, democracy, justice and liberty."
<p>"He was truly a man of letters, a man who read a lot, who was always
current," said his stepdaughter, Uva Clavijo, executive assistant to the
president at FIU.
<p>Marquez Sterling, she said, was "a brilliant, simple man, unpretentious,
tender, a gentleman. He was modern in his thinking and old-fashioned in
his principles."
<p>He showed no signs of slowing down in his last days.
<p>In the past six months, he took part in an oral history project at FIU.
He sat and spoke about Cuba for six hours. If the current government should
fall, he said, he would like to return to help rebuild the country.
<p>"He loved Cuba very much and he taught me to love Cuba," Clavijo said.
"He had faith in Cubans and the future of Cuba. He never lost that faith."
<p>In addition to Clavijo, Marquez Sterling is survived by his wife, Uva;
sons, Carlos and Manuel; daughters, Lucia A. Perez and Gloria Andujar;
13 grandchildren and four great- grandchildren.
<p>Visitation is from 1 to 11 p.m. Sunday at Caballero Douglas Road Funeral
Home. A funeral Mass will be at 11 a.m. Monday at St. Raymond Catholic
Church.
