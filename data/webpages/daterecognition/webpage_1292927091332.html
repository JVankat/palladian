  <p> "Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the 
    consent of the governed, unless they are Indians�."-Frontispiece for "Sovereignty 
    Under Siege:<br>
    A Study of Federal Seizure of Indian Jurisdiction" by Robert L. Pirtle and 
    M. Frances Ayer, 1998.</p>
  <p align="left"> <i>Around the world, governments use military force against 
    the sovereignty of indigenous populations to protect state or corporate interests. 
    When education is also used as a tool to maintain socio-economic and political 
    structures, a form of "educational militarization" exists that counters the 
    authentic goals of public institutions of learning. This is what is happening 
    on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.</i></p>
  <p align="left"> Outside of educational institutions, corporate and military 
    partnerships are an obvious threat to indigenous sovereignty.<br>
    A few of the many examples will suffice: </p>
  <p align="left">The culture of the U'wa people of Columbia is currently being 
    threatened by oil drilling. A military patch depicting a soldier standing 
    next to an oil rig is worn on the right shoulder of every soldier that protects 
    oil installations in Colombia. The U'wa, an indigenous community of 5000 people, 
    do not want to be part of the cycle of violence that oil development brings. 
    But as oil companies and the government increase pressure on the U'wa, more 
    soldiers wearing this patch are appearing on their lands.</p>
  <p align="left"> The Raramuri simarone people of Central Mexico have chosen 
    to live in remote caves deep in Copper Canyon rather than adopt western cultural 
    values. Yet, efforts to protect their land from development and lumbering 
    are thwarted my military intervention. Moreover, with the illicit support 
    of corrupt government military troops, drug mobsters violently are forcing 
    the Indians to grow opium poppies on remote corn fields.</p>
  <p align="left">In the heart of the United States of America, in my own home 
    state of South Dakota, the White Plume family's efforts to support themselves 
    with a hemp farm was halted in an early morning raid by 25 FBI and Drug Enforcement 
    Agency troopers armed with AK-47s. Without any warning or involvement of the 
    sovereign Lakota nation, whose laws support the growing of industrial grade 
    hemp, the intruders destroyed the entire crop, ending their hope for ecological 
    economic development in this impoverished region. </p>
  <p align="left">Similarly, in an effort to close down a border-town liquor store 
    responsible for contributing to the plague of alcoholism on the reservation 
    (and indirectly responsible for the unresolved murder of several Lakota men,) 
    a peaceful protest march occurs every Saturday from the reservation line to 
    the liquor store. Each time, armed police officers line the streets with police 
    dogs in spite of the fact that most of the protesters are elderly men and 
    women. This action prevents others from participating, thus minimizing the 
    effectiveness of the protest.</p>
  <p align="left"> These are some examples of the corporate/military/government 
    partnership outside the educational arena. But the colonizing is also a part 
    of formal schooling. Up until only the last two decades, Indian children were 
    taken away from their parents and forced into western culture's school systems. 
    Their hair was cut off and their mouths were washed out with soap if they 
    spoke their native language. They were beat if they misbehaved. They were 
    forced to wear uniforms. Under threat of punishment, they were not allowed 
    to participate in their spiritual ceremonies and were forced to learn Christian 
    orthodoxy. </p>
  <p align="left">Today the colonizing effect of the corporate/government powers 
    are more subtle but equally powerful. It is found in</p>

<div align="center"> 
  <p align="left"> I want to briefly discuss each of these, then follow with a 
    recommendation to remedy this unfortunate situation.</p>
  <p align="center"><a href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
  <p align="left"> <font size="4"><u>The Curriculum:</u></font></p>
  <p align="left">State standardized curriculum is generally disconnected from 
    relevant and meaningful context. This is damaging to any learner, but it is 
    especially harmful to American Indian children whose views on learning traditionally 
    emphasize complex and mysterious interconnections. Subjects most important 
    to the culture like the arts are minimized. </p>
  <p align="left">What is worse than fragmented subjects, however, is an agenda 
    that continues to ignore oppressive historical and contemporary interpretations 
    of reality. A good example of what I mean is a course on "The First Americans" 
    taught in a particular social studies class for sixth graders at a reservation 
    school. Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone, two anglo pioneers of 19th century 
    fame, were presented as "the first Americans."</p>
  <p align="left"> Of course, one of the more egregious examples is how Christopher 
    Columbus is often regarded in the curriculum. An extreme example of this can 
    be found in the words of Jeffrey Hart, the Distinguished Professor of English 
    at Dartmouth University and senior editor of the National Review, a magazine 
    influential in current U.S. government policy making decisions. He says, "Columbus 
    was a genuine hero of history and of the human spirit. To denigrate him is 
    to denigrate what is worthy in human history and in us all." </p>
  <p align="left">This view is often taught in American schools today and sometimes 
    even on Indian reservations. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue, then 
    he "discovered" America, is how it goes. Seldom do students learn about his 
    return voyage in 1493 with an invasion force of 17 ships and his orchestration 
    of an extermination of the native population in the Caribbean islands that 
    reduced about 8 million people down to 100,000 within 7 years and down to 
    only 200 individuals within 50 years.(2) Of course, within the next 100 years, 
    100 million more of America's first nation's people would be killed by disease 
    and violence. This also is not a favorite subject in American classrooms, 
    but certainly gives pause for the adoration of Columbus. </p>
  <p align="left">All in all, the curriculum that American Indians are forced 
    to learn does more to crush their own cultural values than it does to prepare 
    them to cope in the dominant culture. A letter written by an anonymous American 
    Indian in 1744 to the educators at William and Mary College illustrates a 
    point that could be made today:</p>
  <p align="left"><i>&quot; We know that you highly esteem the kind of learning 
    taught in those colleges, that the maintenance of our young men, while with 
    you, would be very expensive to you. We are convinced that you mean to do 
    us good by your proposal; and we thank you heartily. But you, who are wise, 
    must not take it aim if our ideas of education happen not to be the same as 
    yours. We have had some experience of it. Several of our young people were 
    formerly brought up at the colleges of the northern provinces; they were instructed 
    in all your subjects; but when they came back to us, they were bad runners, 
    ignorant of every means of living, neither fit for hunters nor counselors, 
    they were totally good for nothing. We are however, not the less oblig'd by 
    your kind offer, tho' we decline accepting it; and to show our grateful sense 
    of it, if the gentlemen of Virginia will send us a dozen of their sons, we 
    will take care of their education, instruct them in all we know, and make 
    men of them."(3) </i></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>High-Stakes Standardized Testing</u></font></p>
  <p align="left"> According to President Bush's new education program, "Leave 
    No Child Behind," any school that does not achieve significant improvement 
    in standardized test scores will be punished by the removal of federal and 
    state dollars from that school. American Indians score the lowest on such 
    tests than any other population. Notwithstanding the fact that the tests illustrate 
    an approach to teaching and learning that stifles creative and critical thinking, 
    the tests themselves are biased to non-Indian students.The requirements for 
    schools to play this game add to the continuing colonization of the Indian 
    children. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Neo-Conservative Character Education</u></font></p>
  <p align="left"> President Bush has proposed 25 million dollars for character 
    education programs throughout the United States and the push for such programs 
    on high-crime Indian reservations is significant. Unfortunately, these programs 
    tend to be extensions of conservative ideology and are more about compliance 
    to authority than good character. Reflection on character as it relates to 
    ecological issues, social justice problems and democratic ideals is minimal 
    in many of the popular character education programs. My new book, <i>Teaching 
    Virtues: Building Character Across the Curriculum</i>, offers an American 
    Indian perspective that, according to Vine Deloria and Noam Chomsky, offers 
    a "much needed perspective" on this subject.</p>
  <p align="left"> <font size="4"><u>BIA Mentality</u></font> </p>
  <p align="left">Reservation schools are largely under the influence of the Bureau 
    of Indian Affairs. According to Indian educator, Terry Albers, this leads 
    to "doing things the right way, but not doing the right thing." As a result, 
    money for education is wasted, innovative practices are either ignored or 
    suppressed, and children become cogs in the bureaucratic machinery of an agency 
    that has historically been more dangerous to Indian sovereignty and health 
    than helpful. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Non-Indian Teachers</u></font> </p>
  <p align="left">Nearly 70% of the teachers in the 14 elementary schools and 
    4 high schools on Pine Ridge are non-Indian teachers. Although many are wonderful, 
    caring people, more than a few actually are prejudiced against Indian people 
    and their ways. Thus, the hidden curriculum of assimilation is not so hidden. 
  </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Blood Quantum Policies</u></font></p>
  <p align="left">Government monies for educational institutions relate to tribal 
    membership and tribal membership relates to blood quantum and blood quantum 
    requirements for federal dollars is controlled by the federal Bureau of Indian 
    Affairs. The genocidal potential of this is devastating because the only way 
    to assure sufficient blood quantum is to marry from within the tribe. This 
    is getting harder to do without marrying close relatives. But for a starving 
    people, marrying a first cousin is preferable to losing funding and many of 
    our students go to school as a way to earn money. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Authoritarian Pedagogy</u></font></p>
  <p align="left">In<i> Primal Awareness: A True Story of Survival and Transformation 
    with the Raramuri,</i> I show how most indigenous people see authority in 
    terms of personal experience and reflection in light of the spiritual awareness 
    that all things are related. Indian student drop out rates on the reservation 
    are 70%, higher than any other population group. One reason for this is the 
    top-down structure of instruction and the lack of opportunities for individual 
    relevance and critical, challenging inquiry. </p>
  <p align="center"><a href="#">Back to Top</a></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Military Recruitment </u></font></p>
  <p align="left">Lakota people are proud of their veterans because of the traditional 
    values of bravery and fortitude, so children are likely candidates for U.S. 
    armed forces recruitment campaigns. Recruiters tell young people the military 
    is a way out of the poverty of the reservation. However, because the military 
    system so opposes natural Indian philosophy, the men wind up either court-marshaled 
    for desertion or they return to the reservation embittered and join the ranks 
    of the oppressed. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Decreasing Boundaries </u></font></p>
  <p align="left">12,000 Lakota people live within the 100 x 50 square mile reservation 
    and nearly 5000 are wait listed for housing. Land is continually being confiscated 
    by the federal government in violation of treaty rights and non-Indian ranchers 
    often move boundary lines to encroach on Indian lands. The result of this 
    situation is that the best and the brightest students leave the hopelessness 
    of reservation life for better opportunities, thus leaving behind less social 
    capital for authentic solutions. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Administrative Sabotage</u></font> </p>
  <p align="left">Administrators for the K-16 schools on Pine Ridge are trained 
    to maintain a rigorous status quo by mandating bureaucratic efficiencies that 
    tend to stifle critical and creative thinking. In keeping with the "oppressors 
    that rise to power tend to oppress" motive, the problems relating to such 
    "sabotage" of authentic cultural values are intensified. </p>
  <p align="left">Another interesting development relates to our president's initiative 
    to encourage retired military personal to move into administrative and teaching 
    positions throughout the nation's schools in order to meet the increasing 
    demand for teachers and administrators. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Religious Conversion</u></font></p>
  <p align="left"> Most of the education of American Indians has been designed 
    to destroy their Indian identity. Missionaries imprisoned Indian parents who 
    would not send their children to schools. Punished children who referred to 
    their own culture or spoke their own language. The First Amendment to the 
    U.S. Constitution, respecting separation of church and state, did not apply 
    to Indian children and allowed the Secretary of the Interior to have jurisdiction 
    of Indian education. Missionaries in fact were provided with federal funds 
    to educate Indian children. Until 20 years ago the Indian child was taught 
    that to follow the way of his or her people was sinful. In many ways, this 
    remains the hidden curriculum.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>State Exemption </u></font></p>
  <p align="left">States have been given permission by the federal government 
    to regulate Indian education but states have withheld public services to Native 
    Americans because of their special relation with the federal government. Yet 
    hoses states utilize the native population census to increase their share 
    of federal funds for public services. The secretary of the Interior assesses 
    fees for various services which benefit Indians even though the monies given 
    to us by the federal government are in fact related to federal bonds or other 
    legal obligations to us.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>The Solution</u></font></p>
  <p align="left">It may seem even arrogant to say that there is a worldview common 
    to many indigenous people that is a prerequisite for true democracy-based 
    education. However, contrasting the generally opposing assumptions of indigenous 
    and more dominant cultures can, I hope, stimulate a vital dialogue that can 
    lead us to a more truthful understanding of our mutual goals. I use the word, 
    "truthful," here with Parker Palmer's wonderful definition in mind. In his 
    book, The Courage to Teach, he says, "Truth is an eternal conversation about 
    things that matter, conducted with passion and discipline."</p>
  <p align="left"> My assertion is that until educational systems modify their 
    essential worldview with one more in harmony with that of traditional indigenous 
    tribes, such as those of America's first nation peoples, schools will continue 
    to erode, not sustain democracy.</p>
  <p align="left"> I am not saying that any race, culture, religion or ideology 
    is better than any other. All people of any race or culture are subject to 
    living according to unhealthy assumptions. However, if we study the outcomes 
    of their respective worldviews, I believe that traditional indigenous perspectives, 
    such as those held by North American Indian tribes, have proven healthier 
    for the common good than those that have driven more dominant cultures for 
    the past two thousand years. </p>
  <p align="left">I close by asking you to consider the primary differences between 
    the dominant worldview and the American Indian worldview as I state what former 
    is.(4)</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It sees genuine democracy as being about equal rights for 
      all members of the democratic community not just for property owners.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> Its focus is on cooperative systems, not predominantly 
      about competition and "winning." </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It is about the common good for life's intricate interconnections, 
      not about the accumulation of individual material gain or authoritarian 
      power.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It assumes that children are inherently sacred, not bad 
      or relatively incompetent.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It believes that woman are the models for moral strength 
    </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It sees reflection on personal experience in light of spiritual 
      awareness, not religious dogma, as the source of authority, rather than 
      external authority figures or institutions as being absolute.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It emphasizes intrinsic motivation to meet universal principles 
      of right. It does not emphasize external rewards and punishments for the 
      motivation to do good.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It is aware that all things are related, people as well 
      as rocks, trees, rivers and animals</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It leads to a world of joyful relationships, not to a culture 
      based on fear.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> It is about balance and is not inclined toward conveniences 
      that lead to wholesale conditions of personal and ecological disease or 
      poor health. </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> Spirituality is guided by the great mystery, rather than 
      by orthodoxy that claims exclusive knowledge about God or that allows one 
      groups to force conversion on another. </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left">All great cultures have the same universal principles somewhere 
    in their memory, but too many have forgotten them, allowing misinterpretations 
    and power politics to create new belief systems or apathy. On the Pine Ridge 
    reservation, the joyful recognition of life's beauty still exists here and 
    there, but only outside the places that have robbed people from their heritage. 
    Oppression from within is common, for as Victor Frankl taught, the oppressed 
    become the oppressors when blinded by the worldview that ignores the principles 
    outlined above. Oppression from the dominant culture continues in many forms, 
    most notably in our education systems. Yet there is hope if enough of us reform 
    our schools in accordance with the universal path to harmony our indigenous 
    brothers and sisters from around the world still remember in their hearts.</p>
  <p align="left">At a recent conference of the American Education Research Association 
    in Seattle, Washington, 96-year old Maxine Green was given a prestigious award 
    from the John Dewey Society. Upon accepting it, she said,</p>
  <p align="left">"<i>I traveled across the United States not just to receive 
    this wonderful award, but to say something you must hear. When I worked with 
    John Dewey in 1939, he was trying to protect democracy from outside threats 
    with education that fostered free inquiry, creative imagination and moral 
    reflection. Today, such a curriculum is rare, and as a result, I want to tell 
    you that an even bigger threat to democracy exists, only this time from within."</i></p>
  <p align="left">Nell Noddings, author of many books on a caring curriculum, 
    followed Dr. Greene by saying, <i>"Teachers have been far too quiet on this 
    subject. It is time for a rebellion."</i></p>
  <p align="left"> Ohiyesa, A Dakota Indian from South Dakota who was the first 
    America Indian to earn a medical degree from Boston University back in 1890, 
    once asked, <i>"Is there not something worthy of perpetuation in our Indian 
    spirit of democracy, where Earth, our mother, was free to all, and no one 
    sought to impoverish or enslave his neighbor?"</i></p>
  <p align="left">I believe all of us, in our hearts, know the answer to his question. 
    It is time now to act.</p>
