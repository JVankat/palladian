    <P>The RL Fee Administration Board (FAB) was convened on Friday, December 18, 1998, to review the RL Line Management and Functional Support Management assessments of FDH performance against the criteria established in the FY 1998 Performance Expectation Plan for the FDH &#145;MEGA&#146; fee incentive. The &quot;MEGA&quot; incentive includes all aspects of FDH performance under the contract not covered by the &quot;Critical Few&quot; Performance Incentives. The maximum fee potential for the &quot;MEGA&quot;
      incentive for FY 1998 is $6,690,000. In the Project Performance area, the FAB gave FDH an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating. In the area of FDH Overall Management and Support Performance, the FAB gave FDH a &quot;Good&quot; rating. In the area of Significant Issues and Events, the FAB found significantly more Major Accomplishments than Deficiencies. On a composite basis, the FAB recommends an overall rating of &quot;Excellent&quot; for FDH with payment of 82% of the available &quot;MEGA&quot;
      fee potential.</P>
    
    <P>Performance in the second half of the fiscal year was much improved over that of the first half. At the end of the fiscal year, there was a trend of solid improvement in most major areas of importance. The areas where improvement trends had not been noted by the end of the fiscal year were: Quality Assurance; Criticality Safety; Subcontract Administration; and Technology Management. In each project and functional support area, there were generally more <I>Positive Achievements </I>than
      there were <I>Areas for Improvement.</I> There were very few <I>Deficiencies</I>. There were no areas rated &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot;. In all areas that were rated &quot;Marginal&quot;: the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP), Procurement, and Training; performance improvements in the last half of the fiscal year were universally noted. The strong finish in FY98 established a good foundation upon which improvements can be made during FY99.</P>

        <LI>The Contractor designed, tested, and fielded an improved mobile glove box for grab-sampling, which resulted in a reduced number of personnel and environmental contaminations for grab-sampling operations.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Implementation of the Basis for Interim Operations (BIO) required the development of new procedures for calculating structural loads on tank domes, including baseline loads from existing conditions and soil overburden, as well as loads from equipment used in the farms, such as cranes, trucks, and exhausters. A new procedure was developed and implemented, and dome calculations were revised in accordance with this new procedure, allowing rotary-mode core sampling to proceed.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Fluor Daniel Hanford (FDH) and Lockheed Martin Hanford Corporation (LMHC) provided excellent support to the TWRS Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) verification review conducted September 28 through October 9, 1998.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor has made significant progress in transitioning from the TWRS Interim Safety Basis to the TWRS BIO with the completion of the BIO Window 3 actions and completion of the BIO Compensatory Measures.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The TWRS Authorization Basis documentation is readily available through the Contractor's PROCINFO automated information management system.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor's Engineering Change Notice (ECN) process, coupled with the TWRS Docket process, substantially strengthens the TWRS Authorization Basis.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor developed an Exposure Monitoring, Reporting, and Exposure Records Management program (HNF-PRO-409, Rev 0) to further improve the monitoring for exposure and toxicological effects of chemical exposures in the tank farms. This program meets the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.1020 and 29 CFR 1910, Subpart Z requirements.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor developed a comprehensive ergonomics program plan to effectively reduce the frequency, severity, cost, and physical exposure associated with musculoskeletal disorders and injuries in the tank farms (HNF-IP-0842.IX, 4.3, Rev 0). The program meets the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Elements of Ergonomics and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.5 (a).</LI>

      <P><U>Areas for Improvement:</U></P><OL>
        <LI>In a recent contamination event, it was not clear to the sampling system Operators if and/or when respirators were required to be worn, to re-enter the contaminated work-site. In this specific event there were no uptakes of contaminated materials. However, an improvement in the conduct of operations is needed in this area.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>In response to the Richland Operations Office (RL) direction in letter number 98-SCD-098, FDH provided a status on the implementation of the TWRS Project Authorization Agreement (AA). The TWRS AA was signed by RL and FDH on July 24, 1998, and became effective on September 22, 1998. The TWRS ISMS Phase I Verification Review conducted from September 28, 1998 through October 9, 1998, reported a concern that the environmental permits, which are part of the TWRS Authorization Envelope,
          are not being managed with adequate configuration control, which is required by the TWRS AA.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The annual update of the <I>High Level Waste Storage Tank Farms/242-A Evaporator Standards/Requirements Identification Document (Tank Farm S/RID)</I> was not accepted by RL due to:<UL TYPE="DISC">
            <LI>an incomplete submittal (the chapter on configuration management was not submitted, and</LI>
            <LI>the omission of pertinent technical requirements, specifically from DOE 5480.28.
              <P></P></LI>
          </UL></LI>
        <LI>The FY98 safety performance reflected a slight downturn as compared with FY97. Reporting of Total OSHA Recordables decreased slightly, from 31 in FY97 to 26 in FY98. However, severity of the injuries increased with a total of 15 OSHA Recordable Lost and Restricted Workdays Cases reported in FY98 versus 11 in FY97, resulting in a final injury rate of 1.32 injuries per 200,000 work hours.</LI>

While schedules are resource loaded, unique personnel resources have not been effectively managed, causing delays to key activities such as the Tank AZ-101 mixer pump test and the Light Duty Utility Arm (LDUA) deployment.
          <P>While tank farm Operations have been implementing a new system for scheduling manpower 60 to 90 days in advance of the work, Retrieval Project activities are not being accomplished in accordance with the MYWP schedule. Within two weeks of having signed the FY99 Performance Agreements (PA&#146;s), DOE was informed that work on the LDUA would probably slip because of limited tank farm operational personnel. Although this did not occur during FY98, this would imply that the scheduling
            system has not been as effective as proposed and further work needs to be done in this area. </P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor did not demonstrate the ability to complete parallel activities identified in the MYWP on schedule and in a quality manner during the first half of the year. Activities associated with Performance Agreements (PAs) received high priority focus at the expense of activities not associated with PAs. For example, the Readiness-To-Proceed activities impacted a number of other Feed Delivery activities such as support for Hanford Tanks Initiative (HTI) meetings and DNFSB
          deliverables. Specifically, operators were not available for training on the LDUA because of &quot;higher priority work.&quot; When viewed in conjunction with comment #1 above, a trend of ineffective management of tank farm resources continues to be present.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Planning for work required beyond Privatization Phase I has been limited and this has made interactions with internal and external organizations difficult. For example, delays in SST pumping leave TWRS without a clearly articulated set of needs for vadose zone and groundwater modeling, and has made negotiation of a path forward on SST Retrieval, with Washington Department of Ecology, difficult. In addition, planning for Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board (DNFSB) Systems
          Engineering deliverables was overlooked early in the fiscal year. This contributed to failure to meet two DNFSB deliverables.
          <P>In the second half of the year, the contractor has emphasized the need to accomplish planning for work required beyond Privatization Phase I, and it is being reflected in the planning for the FY99 MYWP. Preparation of the SST Mission Analysis demonstrates that efforts are now being made to plan the Phase II retrieval work. </P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor's evaluation of the Immobilized High-Level Waste (IHLW) Interim Storage Facility Project W-464 schedule risk, in the January 1998 Readiness-to-Proceed Memorandum, did not include the results of a December 1997 feasibility study on the modification of the Materials Handling Machine (MHM) for the 4.5 meter canister. The December 1997 feasibility study indicated that the 4.5 meter canisters required a stronger and heavier MHM, which in turn had a major impact on the
          seismic design criteria. When the W-464 Conceptual Design Report (CDR) was issued for review on February 27, 1998, the seismic issue had not been resolved; and furthermore, it was determined that the Spent Nuclear Fuel Project objected to taking the MHM out of service for modifications. Consequently, a highly compressed schedule to revise the CDR to address these problems was required in order to be ready for project validation in April 1998. In this situation, DOE believes the
          management and communication of important risks should have been better.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>During the first half of the year, the Contractor was reluctant to provide DOE with Information Copies of documents and correspondence that have been produced under the Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC). To obtain needed information, DOE requested the documents from several levels of management. Delays of days and weeks were the norm. While DOE&#146;s right to all information was not challenged, Contractor management delayed delivery of requested information to the maximum
          extent possible, thus impeding DOE management and staff in the execution of their assigned responsibilities. Since the interim evaluation, there has been a remarkable improvement in this area, with the exception of the HTI project and in certain instances in the Storage and Disposal areas.

        <LI>WMH/Hanford Analytical Laboratory Operations successfully met most customer needs despite uncertainty of future work and numerous operational and organizational changes and challenges. This is confirmed by third-quarter customer surveys showing very good customer satisfaction. At a midyear survey at WSCF, over 90% of customers responding were satisfied, and over 90% of turnaround times were met. 222-S succeeded in meeting most commitments for all customers, until the June 1998
          stand-down, and responded well in prioritizing restart activities and producing results for customers after the stand-down. For example, production at 222-S was managed so that commitments for TWRS were exceeded, despite capacity lost due to TWRS sampling delays in the first quarter. Analytical Services exceeded the planned 20.0 Analytical Equivalent Units (AEU&#146;s) by accomplishing 23.6 AEU&#146;s of analysis with a 6% reduction in the cost of unit services. 222-S has developed a
          highly detailed and complex analytical work planning process that has facilitated this success. However, work shutdown at the end of the year negatively impacted other results.

The overall performance to this expectation has not been satisfactorily achieved on the SNFP. While there have been some accomplishments achieved during the year, these fall short of the DOE expectations. For
          example only 9 of 37 milestones have been completed. The critical path was delayed for eight months during FY98 because of poor performance on Cold Vacuum Drying (CVD) design and lack of funds to pursue planned work following late identification of project cost overruns. These problems seriously jeopardized on-going TPA negotiations. Poor cost and schedule control resulted in a GAO and Congressional Committee investigation of the SNFP, more frequent detailed reviews by the DNFSB, and
          additional oversight by other regulatory agencies under the tri-party agreement.

FDH further failed to comply with DOE direction to install an engineering solution to resolve this USQ on the drain valves by September 18, 1998.</LI>
            <LI>The ability for DOE to carry out its mission to assure removal of degraded spent nuclear fuel from the K Basins is accomplished safely is being compromised by the failure to demonstrate that new construction designs meet applicable safety requirements. DOE letter 98-SFD-189, dated September 11, 1998, identified that the required codes/requirements information was not provided in the CVD FSAR submittal. The information provided in the FSAR submittal did not demonstrate compliance
              with DOE Order 6430.1A, or the Spent Nuclear Fuels NRC Equivalency document, and this deficiency was identified as a significant, recurring failure to comply with the requirements for documentation of design adequacy. DOE letter 98-SFD-178, dated September 3, 1998, identified that the safety class design requirements and applicable codes had not been provided as required in the Cask Loadout System (CLS) Safety Analysis Document (SAD). </LI>

      <P><U>General Comments:</U></P>
      <P>The overall safety situation of the 324/327 facilities was strengthened as FY98 progressed. Some quality issues were raised, having to do with inadequate attention to details concerning shipments of Cesium (Cs) capsules to the Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility (WESF) that needed to be returned for rework, and misidentification of fuel segments sent to waste burial grounds. However, BWHC developed a process for improving the quality of the more complex workscope to be
        accomplished, and continued to improve that process throughout the year. Procedures have also been developed which document this process. Even though the facilities received poor marks on the FEB evaluation on emergency preparedness, the reaction of BWHC personnel in handling the &quot;picric acid&quot; situation was outstanding. As other situations arose during the year where safety concerns were raised (e.g., resolution of tank 113 contents in B cell), conservative stances were taken
        to ensure adequate reviews were undertaken before further handling of those situations were allowed. A review of the reportable events for the year indicate that actions are being taken to respond properly, critiques are being held and their quality is improving, and the nature of the events reported are not indicative of serious problems with safety at the facility. The delay in developing the 324 and 327 Safety Analysis Report (SAR) upgrades was a major shortcoming during the period.</P>
      <P>Environmental activities during the year were conducted satisfactorily with the exception of the coordination of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) testing of the Tritium generators. Lessons were learned with this event that have carried into succeeding interfaces with the regulators, and there is much more sensitivity within the Project to assuring adequate communication with regulators under all circumstances. In general, the waste management procedures need to be
        strengthened.</P>
      <P>Development of the training program has improved during the year as it has evolved into a more comprehensive program. With the FEB findings indicating weaknesses in several areas, a lot of emphasis has been placed on the development of procedures to document the processes at the facilities. Many corrective actions have been taken to resolve FEB findings, though additional time will be required in order to train the staff on the procedures and to see the results of a more formal
        operation. Management has also made significant organizational changes to strengthen the safety, environmental and work control processes at the facilities.</P>
      <P>Overall, the Contractor&#146;s Cost Performance has been excellent, specifically in their ability to accomplish unfunded program workscope while still providing funding back to other Facility Stabilization projects. However, program work scope completed has overrun their budget on the 327 waste bucket processing and the Cesium Chloride (CsCl) program. While the B cell cleanout program did under-run their budget, <STRIKE>but</STRIKE> there was also a significant amount of carryover
        workscope that was not accomplished.</P>

        <LI>The Phase I groups were curtailed in January 1997 along with all other groups, yet it took the contractor 16 months to resume these simple movements by these generally well performing groups. The first RL readiness assessment was delayed in November 1998, when the Contractor&#146;s facility Criticality Safety Representative and the Vault Operations manager failed to recognize a criticality infraction a Nuclear Chemical Operator (NCO) had recognized and brought to their attention.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>RL reviews of the Management Oversight Plans (MOPs) for fissile material movements conducted by the Phase II group have consistently identified the need for extensive and frequent rework. In many cases the observations made by RL reviewers are the same observations made by these reviewers during their Phase I oversight activities &#150; or during earlier Phase II group reviews. In this fundamental quality assurance issue alone, the contractor has demonstrated an inability to learn
          from its mistakes and demonstrate a continuous improvement throughout the facility. Despite RL direction, senior PFP managers are not actively involved in the preparation of MOPs, in pre-movement activities, and in the movements themselves. RL assessors continued to identify significant weaknesses in MOPs, inadequacies in pre-job briefings, poor quality dry runs and walkthroughs.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>In late February of 1998, a final check by the Team Leader for the RL Line Management Readiness Review team tasked with determining the readiness of Phase I groups to resume fissile material handling noted that almost 40% of the post-start actions had either missed their due dates, had rescheduled due dates set by the condition owners, or had both rescheduled due dates and were delinquent to the new dates. Contractor senior management was not aware of this problem until it was
          brought to their attention by RL.

        <LI>The PRF recovery schedule has continued to slip in FY98. The damaged roof was still not repaired, and the facility is now entering its second winter after the explosion. During the winter of 1997-1998, special efforts had to been taken to brush snow off the roof to ensure it would not collapse. So many conduct of operations and worker safety deficiencies were identified by RL assessors after the explosion that a Joint Review Team (JRT) was established, made up of representatives of
          RL, FDH, and BWHC. This body reviewed every work package developed for recovery work until it was disbanded the first day of the second quartet of FY98. A simple paper intended to demonstrate that workers could enter PRF without supplied air respiration required numerous rejections by the RL member of the JRT before a good quality document was finally provided. Further, although a Chemical Hazard Assessment (CHA) conducted after the explosion identified several potential liabilities,
          including unidentified liquids in gloveboxes HC-7 and HC-46F, the work plans to sample and mitigate these potential liabilities were not worked in FY98, despite extensive RL pressure to do so. The liquids in glovebox HC-7 have subsequently evaporated and no longer appear to be present in the glovebox.

        <LI>The Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) management is commended for a very successful and effective job of maintaining the experienced, well-trained staff and facilities to support a potential restart mission. The FFTF Project Team&#146;s positive attitude and focus toward &quot;safety first&quot; and excellence in conduct-of-operations is reflected by the safety record of no lost workday cases and only one restricted workday case for the entire year. The Team&#146;s attention to strive
          for continuous improvement in all facets of plant operations was realized by the recent Facility Evaluation Board&#146;s (FEB&#146;s) assessment of FFTF. The FEB found the FFTF&#146;s overall performance, including each of the ten functional areas, to be at &quot;level 2&quot;, meets expectations (standards of performance are high). Other areas that are appreciated are the contractors willingness to respond to special requests and their forthright and timely approach of involving U. S.
          Department of Energy (DOE), oversight personnel with any issues that arise.

        <LI>Building Occupancy: In FY98, great strides to fully utilize the government office space have been made. The occupancy pool is one of the larger costs of the indirect program. A major gain in utilization rates was realized in FY98. The occupancy pool costs for FY98 came in approximately $2 million below budget.

        <LI>The 200 Area fabrication shops have played key roles in some of Hanford&#146;s highest profile cleanup projects. Site Fabrication Services (SFS) supported the Spent Nuclear Fuel Project by fabricating 30 Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) Fuel Baskets and five MCO Scrap baskets that will be used in the transportation and storage of the spent nuclear fuel now stored in the K-basins. SFS completed fabrication of all jumpers requested by TWRS Tank Farms within the requested time frames. SFS

A record six such moves were made within the 12-month period (from barges arriving at the Port of Benton for transshipment to onsite burial grounds). Each move required intensive management of limited resources and coordination among customers, contractors, state and federal agencies. Road maintenance
          crews used more than 150 tons of salt and over 3800 cubic yards of sand to ensure traveling surfaces were as safe as possible during foul weather in January. Personnel worked overtime and around the clock to ensure that no serious accidents occurred during the severe ice and snow conditions.

      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <U>General Comments:</U></P>
      <P>In 1998 the FDH ESH&amp;Q office engaged in a significant performance turnaround under a new management team. This turn around was demonstrated in strong showings in Occupational Safety and Health (especially worker involvement and Voluntary Protection Program [VPP] efforts), solid strides in the post Plutonium Reclamation Facility (PRF) explosion Emergency Preparedness activities, and solid efforts in Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) implementation. The FDH occupational
        safety statistics reflected this strength by showing strong improvements in FY98.</P>
      <P>Areas of continuing concern that served to lower FDH ESH&amp;Q's performance were the maintenance of Standards/Requirements Identification Documents (S/RIDs), the performance of the Quality Assurance (QA) program (which was significantly deficient in FY98), ongoing conduct of operation issues within the Fire Department, and lackluster efforts in improving Nuclear and Criticality Safety programs. A significant deficiency also exists in that the FDH Corrective Action Management System
        and Deficiency Tracking System problems remain uncorrected after over two years of effort, thus not allowing for solid progress in correcting FDH's long standing ESH&amp;Q issues. </P>
      <P>Performance in ESH&amp;Q's key focus areas was as follows:</P><OL>
        <LI>Integrated ES&amp;H Management System (ISMS): (Rating: Good)<BR>Solid efforts were begun in this area in FY98. Achieving TWRS Phase I validation was a significant effort.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Radiological Control Improvement Program (RCIP): (Rating: Good)<BR>Milestones continue to be met per the RCIP. Hiring of a Radiological Control Manager was positive.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Environmental Protection Project/Chemical Management System: (Rating: Good)<BR> Mixed performance in the environmental area contributed to a good for this element. While environmental reporting and the Environmental Monitoring Program provided excellent performance, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Tri-Party Agreement (TPA) areas produced only good performance. While progress continues in the Chemical Management System arena, solid breakthroughs in FDH chemical
          management performance have yet to come to fruition.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Emergency Preparedness Improvement Program: (Rating: Excellent)<BR>This effort has demonstrated appropriate accountability and rigor of follow-up and documentation to result in demonstrated progress in the Emergency preparedness area.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Quality of Work (including the overall quality of products, Quality Program efforts and the QA program area): (Rating: Marginal)<BR>The quality of work provided by the ESH&amp;Q organization is sporadic, with documents with technical and calculation errors, as well as typographical errors, routinely submitted. The overall FDH Quality program (including the QA program) was dysfunctional/ineffective during the period, resulting in numerous QA rule violations and subsequent adverse
          Price-Andersen Act Amendment (PAAA) enforcement activity. Efforts began in late FY98 to rebuild the FDH Quality and QA programs and to instill a quality ethic within FDH.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Safety Culture: (Rating: Good)<BR> The roll out of the Employee Involvement training package, with Hanford Atomic Metal Trades Council (HAMTC) support, to all FDH managers, supervisors and employee's was very positive. Pending VPP applications indicate strides are being made in implementing VPP elements into the site culture. Employee involvement efforts, VPP and the implementation of a &quot;Safety Conscious Work Environment&quot; are beginning to show results in a drop of the
          number of formal employee concerns. However, significant areas of non-support to the new site safety culture still exist, and aggressive management advocacy of the new culture by their field presence has not been sufficient to achieve a turnaround in these areas of resistance.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI> Independent Assessment. (Rating: Good)<BR>The MAC. Chew &amp; Assoc. Independent Assessment function is not well organized into a methodology to attack known or suspected FDH issues. Many reports are ad hoc, and quality of the reports is variable. While the Facility Evaluation Board (FEB) function continues to be solid, the linkages of both the M.C. Chew &amp; Assoc. and FEB functions to a Corrective Action Management System does not ensure that FDH is attacking the root causes of
          FDH's ESH&amp;Q deficiencies, and thus making any fundamental progress against FDH's long standing ESH&amp;Q issues. </LI>

        <LI>The FDH Environmental Protection (EP) organization has improved their effectiveness in assisting FDH in its attempts to achieve the required &quot;effective integration of site-wide permits and environmental compliance issues&quot;. However, they continue to be hampered by some FDH project offices and subcontractors apparently failing to seek or heed advice and/or assistance from Environmental Protection. EP performance needs improvement in issue coordination and integration and
          covering all of the compliance inspections and consequent enforcement actions by the regulatory agencies. Additionally, in some situations it appears that the Project Directors and sub-contractors are deliberately trying to avoid the desired integration and coordination to the detriment of the overall Hanford project. Although this situation has improved since the midyear evaluation, overall FDH and subcontractor performance in this area is below where is should be.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The FDH and subcontractor effort was marginal in coordinating and preparing well conceived and well written responses to the draft Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Permit Modification D Conditions issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) in a timely manner. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operation Office (RL) had to repeatedly stress the need for a solid package by the end of the Public Comment Period in the event that an
          extension would not be granted by Ecology. The first drafts were incomplete, did not provide well-founded arguments for requested changes to the draft permit conditions, and fell short of the needed information to support an appeal of the Resource and Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) Permit, if needed. The late delivery of the final, official responses to RL by FDH allowed RL less than adequate time for review prior to the submittal to Ecology. </LI>

      <P>General comment: In all cases there has been positive movement throughout the year in the listed areas. From both the contract and the MYWP/AWP for Site Planning and Integration, FDH is about one year behind the initial expectation of implementing an effective management system.</P><OL>
        <LI>Although complying with the HQ guidance, the narrative of the Hanford <I>Paths to Closure</I> did not provide easy-to-absorb and seamless flow of information from a strategic-level of planning to a tactical level. Also, analytical efforts and data/information from the Contractor &quot;Projects&quot;, related to the identification of efficiencies, stretch goals and breakthroughs that would accelerate Site cleanup, declined over the year. In addition, estimates of the likelihood of
          success/risks were not identified.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The new FDH Code of Accounts is an excellent foundation for an extremely effective code of accounts structure. However, the current level of detail of the structure elements is often too high to serve as an effective cost control, cost analysis and cost-estimating tool.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The linkage from the baseline document, the MYWP, continues to be disconnected with regard to timeliness for upgrades and linkages among the key management documents, Integrated Site Baseline (ISB) and Project Baseline Summary (PBS), for common elements.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI> The Baseline Change Request (BCR) process was jointly agreed upon and excellent training has taken place. There is evidence that when management&#146;s attention is focused on timely completion of a given BCR, that respective BCR easily meets or exceeds the time processing requirements. However, a large majority of the BCR&#146;s do not get processed in a timely manner.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Primavera (P3) scheduling system and associated ability to provide performance information from schedules (PERF module) is well behind schedule for implementation and well over cost.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>There needs to be more progress made in linking the Systems Integration efforts to the scheduling efforts. Even though the technical database has a means to find internal and external project interfaces within the system, these key interface points cannot currently be reflected on the summary schedules. This makes the product of little use to the project managers as well as the site analysis team.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Although the HSPR was provided to RL on time and the Contractor is participating in the HSPR improvement effort, the Contractor needs to take ownership of the HSPR, and accelerate implementation of the HSPR improvements to meet the October 1998, and monthly thereafter, issuance of the report in a more timely manner.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>While the effort to develop and integrate performance measures has been initiated, the Contractor needs to espouse the intent of the Government Performance &amp; Results Act (GPRA) and pursue the development and implementation of a &quot;Balanced Scorecard&quot; approach to performance measurement more aggressively.

        <LI>Request for Services (RFS) Process: FDH, including both the Finance and Contracts organizations, has worked hard with RL in FY98 to develop a new RFS process that brings both control and rigor into tracking activities under an RFS. An informative training package was developed and presented to the subcontractor organizations.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Analysis of Uncosted Balances: The FY97 year-end analysis of uncosted balances was received from FDH before the due date. Minor deltas between FDH and the DOE Departmental Integrated Standardized Core Accounting System (DISCAS) were discussed and understood. The thresholds established in the DOE Policy on Carryover Balances were met in all but one Control Point for FY97 and sufficient narrative justification was provided for the exception. FDH has demonstrated their commitment to
          control and manage uncosted balances.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Monitoring and Reporting Costs: FDH has done an excellent job in making sure that monthly costs are reviewed to eliminate problems prior to submittal to RL. They have taken the time to trend expenditure rates and talk with the Programs about abnormalities.

        <LI>Monthly Budget Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Briefing: The monthly FDH briefings to the RL CFO have become an excellent forum to identify, discuss, and resolve potential and real financial and budget issues. The communication is open and honest and therefore, very effective. These briefings have been informative and are looked upon as &quot;working group&quot; sessions rather than one-way presentations. These are truly &quot;teaming&quot; sessions that have done much to improve the
          communication and cooperation between the contractor and RL CFO staff. FDH has done an excellent job of customizing the presentations to meet the RL CFO&#146;s needs.

        <LI>Funds Control: Control levels within the operating funds, Inter-DOE Work Orders, Reimbursable Orders, General Plant Project (GPP), and Construction Line Items as identified in the contract controls were not exceeded in FY 1998. The Contractor&#146;s CFO office has been diligent in analyzing the cost data before submittal to DISCAS at DOE-RL. FDH has tried to resolve any cost issues within their internal staff and sub-contractors before they become an issue for DOE-RL.

        <LI>Monthly RFS Status Report: Although the monthly status reporting is good, the Contractor must expend more effort in predicting changes that need to be made to the RFS, such as changes in period of performance or movement of dollars between operating and capital equipment. Changes are usually requested by FDH after the costs have been incurred and submitted and a problem is seen on reports that show deltas in Budget and Reporting (B&amp;R) levels. Requests for time extensions for the
          Inter-DOE Work Orders are not always requested early enough to prevent potential stop work situations.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Monitoring and Reporting Costs: The Contractor must conduct better analyses of how indirect passbacks will affect costs by Activity Data Sheets/Project Baseline Summaries (ADS/PBS) at year-end.

At the mid-year review, FDH had submitted only two letter requests (Lockheed Martin Services, Inc. [LMSI] and Duke Engineering and Services Northwest, Inc [DESNW]) for extending the ENCO subcontracts beyond September 30, 1998. Neither request included decision packages. The process that FDH used for evaluating whether the ENCO contracts should be recompeted
          or extended, considered several factors and included input from cross-cutting parts of the FDH organization; however, FDH did not begin the process early enough to meet the January 9, 1998, date. Briefings were held with RL in January and February with recommendations by FDH to RL in March. As a result, definitized ENCO contracts were not in place at the beginning of FY99 for LMSI and the six Agreements that Fluor Daniel Northwest, Inc. (FDNW) has with the major subcontractors and
          DynCorp are still not in place because of deficiencies identified by RL. Similarly, the terms and conditions of the major subcontracts are still being negotiated while a 120-day extension has been put into place.

      <P><U>General Comments</U></P>
      <P>Site-wide configuration management was strengthened in FY98 through the development and approval of numerous CM procedures and baseline metrics. The two specific deliverables accomplished were the completion of the Project-specific configuration management implementation plans and the definition of a baseline and performance metrics system for essential drawing control. Both the Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) deliverables were completed on schedule and within the established
        expectations. The CM plan and subsequent implementation documentation provides a sound foundation for conducting CM on the site. Full implementation will certainly improve safe and reliable operations of the Projects and their facilities. Development of the drawing control metrics is a noteworthy activity that has raised awareness of facility drawing status and has lead to reductions in unincorporated changes and increased compliance to drawing requirements. The proactive approach of
        this metrics team, through the establishment of metric goals and periodic evaluation for new or modified metrics, will drive continuous improvement in facility baseline and essential drawing control. However, despite these positive accomplishments, configuration management continues to be deficient at Hanford. As evidenced in the third quarter Facility Evaluation Board (FEB) summary report, CM continues to be a site-wide recurring issue. Further, implementation of the CM plan within the
        facilities has not been accomplished consistently and success will require a continued commitment to proactively overcome CM challenges.</P>

        <LI>The Contractor&#146;s efforts related to the establishment of a drawing baseline and metrics associated with the baseline were excellent. The metrics team has been very proactive in establishing meaningful drawing metrics, which are evaluated periodically to achieve continuous improvement. In addition, drawing metric performance goals have been established and noteworthy improvements have been accomplished over the last two months. A similar proactive team has been established by
          the Contractor, to develop a vision for improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of the site drawing system. In the area of configuration management implementation, significant improvement in consistency was achieved by the development of the configuration management Standards/Requirements Identification Document (S/RID) template and the update of the FEB performance objectives and criteria. These activities provide a consistent approach to the definition of CM requirements and
          the assessment of the subsequent implementation.</LI>

We have already noticed improvement in FY99 for Science and Technology (S&amp;T) needs development in producing a Compact Disc &#150; Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) for site needs, and posting Hanford site needs on the Environmental Management (EM) Needs Management System. We
          have also seen an improvement in the reporting of FY 1998 Deployments in the <I>FY 1998 Hanford Technology Deployment Accomplishments (DOE/RL-98-79).</I>

        <LI> Infrastructure: Interfaces with the Site Technology Coordination Group (STCG) and subgroups have improved. FDH-TM has provided useful comments for several EM initiatives: Science and Technology Workshop, EM Integration, and Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) Cost Savings. A significant effort was expended in support of the S&amp;T Workshop, to host and coordinate input from four major DOE sites for improvement of the EM S&amp;T program on the national level. </LI>

        <LI>Science and Technology Needs Identification: It is not clear that FDH-TM is adequately supporting this process. Achievements in FY98 were primarily due to individual initiative. In addition, the results of the process need higher visibility; progress in meeting science and technology needs is not adequately reported on a monthly basis.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Technology Deployment Effectiveness: Most deployment fact sheets were not delivered on time (within 60 days after deployment) and many were not complete. Improvement on development of project-specific deployment plans is needed. Accelerate Site Technology Deployment (ASTD) proposal submittals from the Contractor were late, had insufficient buy-in from users, and were of poor quality. Activities such as ASTD must be addressed in a serious, professional manner with quality submittals
          and full user participation.</LI>

        <LI>Technology Deployment Effectiveness: The implementation of Technology Insertion Points (TIPs) into the FY98 MYWPs was not as successful as RL had hoped. FDH-TM changed the RL guidance on the TIP process, prior to passing the guidance on. This created significant confusion in the Projects as to how TIPs were to be identified. FDH did not provide timely notification to RL of issues surrounding TIPs or provide advance notice that several projects were not planning to incorporate any
          TIPs. It is not clear that FDH-TM adequately &quot;assessed the technology baseline for risk and areas for baseline improvement&quot; nor is there evidence that demonstrates results from &quot;links made with other sites, industry, or academia to identify and implement mature technology expertise that could be imported to Hanford.&quot; Both of these (and similar AWP activities) should be executed with high regard to the importance for improvements to the Hanford baseline. FDH-TM
          should aggressively play the role of middleman and matchmaker, and foster links between users and providers of technology solutions.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Infrastructure: Although there has been an improvement on the national level (S&amp;T Workshop), there has been little improvement or emphasis at the local/site level. FDH needs to recognize and address barriers encountered during science and technology demonstration and deployment activities. This is called out in the AWP but it is not clear what progress has been made regarding barriers already identified by other groups such as Pacific Rim Enterprise Center and the STCG. Although
          FDH-TM and SP&amp;I worked with a team to develop a definition and guidance for TIPs, FDH changed the definition in their guidance to the subcontractors. This led to confusion and made the process all the more difficult to implement. FDH notified the DOE Science and Technology Programs (STP) Division that Facility Transition would not be including any TIPs in the MYWP a couple days before the MYWP was signed. FDH-TM should have been working with their subcontractors to ensure the
          inclusion of TIPs and resolve issues with the subcontractors prior to submittal of the MYWP to DOE. FDH should have also raised the issue to DOE-STP to ensure timely resolution prior to MYWP signing by the DOE Assistant Manager for Facility Stabilization (AMF).
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Hanford Tanks Initiative (HTI) Support: The contractor was very reluctant to provide DOE with information copies of documents and correspondence that have been produced under the PHMC contract. To obtain needed information, DOE requested the information from several levels of management, and delays of days and weeks were the norm. While DOE&#146;s right to all information was not challenged, contractor management delayed delivery of requested information to the maximum extent
          possible, thereby impeding DOE management and staff in the execution of their assigned responsibilities. Emerging HTI issues continued to be a problem and were not brought forward until the last moment and the DOE was asked to take action immediately or suffer project delays and increased budgets.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Management of Annual Work Plan Scope: Management of AWP scope, schedule, and the related formal reporting, needs to be improved. Activities are being lost, falling behind, or being inadequately monitored or reported with the result of missed deadlines, substandard submittals, or insufficient information available to DOE to support decisions or coordinate related activities. </LI>

        <LI>The Contractor&#146;s Office of Economic Transition (OET) helped create 67 cumulative (FY 97-98) creditable jobs meeting the Performance Expectation Plan (PEP) criterion. This total, though shy of the 75 job target, represents a substantial achievement for the community. Additionally, OET&#146;s efforts resulted in substantial savings, which are not a part of the PEP criterion. Nevertheless, these dollar saving are very important and contribute to the &quot;Good&quot; rating, even
          though the 75 job creation target was not met.
          <P>Regarding the job creation target, there are some mitigating factors, which were considered in determining the overall rating. The 67 total would have been higher were it not for (1) setbacks to Kaiser Aluminum (The company did not get a substantial order from Boeing, out of OET&#146;s and FDH&#146;s control) and (2) a lack of &quot;upfront &quot;funds to pay for characterization and cleanup of excessed facilities/equipment, making them desirable and available for transfer. (Note:
            This lack of funds to an extent is due to transfer of some budgeted funds by FDH to other programs because of problems encountered; however, this lack was not within OET&#146;s ability to control).</P></LI>
        <LI>Livingston Rebuild Center: A major locomotive repair company headquartered in Livingston, Montana, signed a lease with the Richland Operations Office (RL) for the high-bay portion of the 1171 Transportation Maintenance Building and rail yard.

The number of jobs resulting from these actions
          was 6.5.

        <LI>A major effort to enable use of U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) underutilized plant and equipment culminated in the transfer of the non-destructive evaluation scope, plus 10 Hanford workers, from DynCorp to Cogema. OET assisted in negotiating a first-of-a-kind facility license and equipment lease that will enable commercial work to be performed side-by-side with DOE work. Though the resulting non-Hanford job gain was less than one, more non-Hanford job gains are expected in the

      <P>The FDH SAS program has realized many noteworthy accomplishments during the reporting period, particularly their safety record. This indicates a sound program at the working level. The problems and deficiencies have involved a performance problem with managing the big issues, such as the nuclear material accountability system, the procurement issues surrounding the PC-AMS deliverable, coordination and communication between FDH, BWHC, and BWP concerning the nuclear material inventory
        problems, and management attention/emphasis on the need to diversify the Patrol Training Academy. In the last quarter of the year, FDH exhibited significantly more management attention to SAS activities, and the personal involvement of Chuck Little, FDH Vice President for Project Support, has been a major lift to the program. Much progress was made subsequent to FDH assuming responsibility back from BWP for SAS across the subcontractors, and the program is entering FY99 in a
        much-improved posture. The expectation is that the deficiencies noted here will be managed and resolved in FY99.</P>

          greater: Lockheed Martin Hanford Corporation, Numatec Hanford Corporation, B&amp;W Protec, Inc., Lockheed Martin Services, Inc., and Fluor Daniel Northwest, Inc.

        <LI>FDH has to assume a leadership role in the development and implementation of training requirements, rather than assuming the posture of being &quot;driven&quot;, as they did during the first part of the year.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>FDH has been unable to complete instructor qualification development, because of the difficulty they are having in identifying all persons who provide instruction.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Although FDH got a late start performing Level III evaluations, 19 were completed during FY98. The adequacy of some of the evaluations were questionable; however, RL-OTR and FDH are working together to come to mutual understanding of OTR&#146;s expectations surrounding the Level III process.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>Through the process of collecting data for the Level I and II Performance Expectation requirement, it came to light that the MSCs were not developing the data consistently. FDH subsequently wrote Level I and II implementing procedures. Currently the procedures are not being followed consistently across the Project Hanford Management Contract (PHMC).</LI>

        <LI>The Contractor's emergency preparedness information management performance continued to show improvement as evidenced by the January 1998 emergency involving picric acid in the 300 Area. Information flow to media outlets was generally concise, accurate, and timely. Management of the Joint Information Center was well coordinated.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor displayed initiative and solid support for media and/or community events targeted to publicize positive achievements at Hanford. Examples include the lease of the 1171 Building to private industry, continuing outreach involving the HAMMER Training Facility, the final closure of all coal-fired steam plants on-site, completion of the Cross-Site transfer line, and the &quot;Lights Out&quot; media event at B-Plant. The Contractor provided good support for dealing with the
          sensitive and highly visible issues surrounding the Spent Nuclear Fuel program and the State&#146;s Notice of Intent to sue regarding single-shell waste tank stabilization.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor has shown marked improvement in the performance of The REACH (Hanford site newspaper) in delivering important, timely, and interesting stories to the site readership. Additionally, the Contractor's special Progress Edition of The REACH was responsive to RL's needs as well as those of the site in communicating accomplishments both on the site and off the site.</LI>

        <LI> The Contractor's performance in developing good relationships with stakeholders was responsive to RL&#146;s needs during the year. Responsiveness to stakeholder inquiries and information requirements was excellent and the Contractor did well in working with U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) RL in providing resources and support for the Public Involvement Program and the Hanford Advisory Board.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor&#146;s legal office continues to provide documents responsive to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act requests in a timely manner. Its searches are thorough and complete. Lockheed Martin Services, Inc. (LMSI) continues to be timely and innovative in its work for RL on the Hanford Home page.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor took a strong leadership role with the public regarding Hanford activities. The best example was the contamination spreads outside of controlled areas in late September. The contractor took a strong and proactive roll to keep the public, media, and employees informed. Although this was decidedly negative news, the contractor took a strong leadership role through frequent employee communications and media availabilities.</LI>

        <LI> The contractor generally provided timely and responsive coordination with RL-OEA. Again with the instance of the contamination spreads, the contractor coordinated employee messages and press materials with RL-OEA and other RL programmatic elements prior to their release to the employees or media. There was improvement late in the fiscal year regarding consistent and timely interaction and coordination on pending issues and media interactions.
          <P></P></LI>
        <LI>The Contractor restructured the External Affairs and other public and/or outreach functions into an Office of Communications &amp; Media Relations and an Office of Community Programs which hopefully will be able to take better advantage capabilities of its staff. Loss of two experienced External Affairs staff members in late FY 98 may create some initial FY 99 problems. </LI>

LMSI has exceeded expectations in timely delivery of Internet services in a professional manner. The LMSI Public Requests Service makes available for sale, any cleared information regardless of format (hard copy, photo, video). The Service responds promptly to all requests, and is able to search databases not available to the public.
          It provided 426 documents to requests from the public in FY 98. When LMSI is notified of the need to update or delete information on the various Home Pages within the realm of the Hanford Home Page, their response is very timely. </LI>
