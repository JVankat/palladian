<p><span style="color: #0000cc;">Welcome to Part Two of our interview with Susan Holloway Scott.&nbsp; We’re celebrating the release of her new historical novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1214771066&amp;sr=1-1"><strong><em>THE KING'S FAVORITE</em></strong></a> --and I’m delighted to report that the book is already appearing in stores--great news for all who’ve been waiting not very patiently for Nell Gwyn’s story. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;">For a tantalizing taste, you can read an excerpt from <strong><em>The King’s Favorite</em></strong> at Susan’s web site.&nbsp; And do visit Facebook, where not only does <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Susan-Holloway-Scott/22630909873">Susan</a> have a brand-new page, <br />but so does <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nell-Gwyn/21255546230">Nell Gwyn</a> herself.&nbsp; Stop by and become a friend to both of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0066;">And don’t forget:&nbsp; Susan will be giving away an autographed copy of <strong><em>The King’s Favorite</em></strong> to a reader who posts a comment or question to this interview.</span><br /><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em></em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England">King Charles II</a> plays, as a monarch ought to do, a major role in both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451221346/ref=cm_arms_pdp_dp"><em><strong>Royal Harlot</strong></em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/045122406X/ref=cm_arms_pdp_dp"><em><strong>The King’s Favorite.</strong></em></a> But we see a different Charles in this book.&nbsp; Did you find him more or less sympathetic in the context of his relationship with Nell?</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Susan:</em></span> This has been one of the most fascinating parts of writing this series of books:<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/22/barbara_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=197,height=300,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="120" height="182" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/06/22/barbara_2.jpg" alt="Barbara_2" title="Barbara_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> the same hero, but viewed through the very different perspective of each heroine.&nbsp; The Charles Stuart in <em><strong>Royal Harlot </strong></em>loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Palmer,_1st_Duchess_of_Cleveland">Barbara Villiers</a> <span style="color: #0000cc;">Palmer, Lady Castlemain</span>e (another beautiful woman who relished the spotlight of celebrity, shown to the right) almost as an equal.&nbsp; They were cousins, and she was undeniably a lady, and even at the rancorous end of their long relationship, he always treated her with the courtesy and generosity due her rank.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But though Charles loved Nell, too, and regarded her as one of his dearest friends, he could not quite forget her humble origins.&nbsp; While he gave her several houses and a handsome income, he never granted her the same titles or livings that he gave to his other long-term mistresses, and his casual disregard for her feelings is as troubling as Nell’s constant forgiveness of his slights towards her.&nbsp; Theirs is undeniably a love story between friends, a fairy tale romance between king and commoner, but it’s also sadly a love story where the hero does not always behave as heroically as he should.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> So while Nell’s name was the last on the dying king’s lips, he did not provide very well for her.&nbsp; How do you account for this?</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/22/oval_charles.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=263,height=350,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="150" height="199" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/06/22/oval_charles.jpg" alt="Oval_charles" title="Oval_charles" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> Susan:</em></span> I wish I could!&nbsp; Actually, there is documentation that Charles had planned finally to give Nell her long-deferred title as a birthday present, a plan thwarted by his own untimely death.&nbsp; &nbsp;Always robustly healthy and athletic, he was stricken one night by a series of debilitating strokes, and thanks to the over-zealous bleeding,&nbsp; purging, and other rigorous attentions of 17th century medicine, died soon after, with no chance to right any of his wrongs to Nell.&nbsp; I think it was more his characteristic procrastination rather than any willful neglect. His dying words were in fact a plea to his brother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England">James</a> “not to let poor Nellie starve”, but James had other plans on his royal agenda beyond looking after his dead brother’s old mistresses.&nbsp; (James was especially cruel in forbidding Nell from Charles’s deathbed, claiming that she’d no right to say farewell to the dying king because she had no title.) Nell didn’t starve, but as soon as Charles’s protection was gone and her income with it, creditors swooped down to claim most of her wealth.&nbsp; When she died soon after Charles in 1687, she left considerable debts –– but also a generous legacy to the prisoners in Newgate.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> Did your research for Nell show you any aspects of the king’s character you might not have<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/22/red_dress_nell.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=338,height=450,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="139" height="186" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/06/22/red_dress_nell.jpg" alt="Red_dress_nell" title="Red_dress_nell" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> previously considered? </p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Susan:</em></span> By the time Charles became seriously involved with Nell (another portrait of her is to the right) in 1668, the first glorious optimism of his early reign had faded.&nbsp; He was faced with the genuine challenges of a difficult Parliament, lack of funds, a country ravaged by plague and a capital struggling to recover from the Great Fire, as well as the constant danger of war with France and the Dutch.&nbsp; Despite being called “the Merrie Monarch”, Charles was often plagued with melancholy (what we’d now call depression.)&nbsp; Nell’s high spirits and ability to amuse him were exactly what the darker side of his personality needed.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> You’ve mentioned on the blog and in our conversations the Victorians’ partiality for Nell.&nbsp; What about her appealed to that straitlaced, hypocritical lot?</p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/22/victorian_nellcharles_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=161,height=200,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="150" height="186" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/06/22/victorian_nellcharles_2.jpg" alt="Victorian_nellcharles_2" title="Victorian_nellcharles_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Susan:</em></span> Every generation interprets the past to suit themselves.&nbsp; The Victorians adored the 17th century, romanticizing Charles I’s doomed cavaliers and Charles II’s Court of wits and gallants and beautiful ladies in plumed hats as if they’d been created by Sir Walter Scott, and glossing over the harsher realities of the Restoration.&nbsp; Scenes from this sentimentalized version of the Restoration were great favorites of Victorian painters as well, such as this one after Edward Matthew Ward, of Nell improbably directing the king in the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire&nbsp; Nell’s doll-like beauty appealed to the Victorians, and they fashioned her into a classic fallen-woman-with-a-heart-of-gold, praising her loyalty to Charles and her generosity to the poor, and making her into such a plucky Magdalene that I suspect the real, more earthy Nell would scarcely recognize herself. By all reports, Nell enjoyed the material rewards of her position as much as any of the other royal mistresses, and was especially proud of her elaborate, over-sized bedstead, featuring portraits of her and Charles, their two sons as cupids, and even her rival mistresses allegorically receiving their just desserts –– and wrought entirely of shining sterling silver!&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Victorian version of Nell, nobly giving away her oranges to the poor, is often the one that appears even today in contemporary histories. </p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> There were other men in Nell’s life beyond the king –– Charles Hart, the actor and an early lover; Lord Buckhurst, Lord Buckingham, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilmot,_2nd_Earl_of_Rochester">Lord Rochester</a> –– all fascinating men who played significant roles in Restoration London.&nbsp; But for me, Rochester was the most intriguing, a lost soul, if ever I’ve met one.&nbsp; Would you tell us something about this other player in Nell’s life?</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Susan:</em></span> There’s no better definition of a lost soul than John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, shown here.&nbsp; Yet another<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/22/rochester3.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=200,height=250,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="150" height="187" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/06/22/rochester3.jpg" alt="Rochester3" title="Rochester3" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> left fatherless by the Civil War, he was regarded as breathtakingly beautiful, funny, intelligent, intellectual, gifted both at writing poetry and the fast-paced banter of Charles II’s Court.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was also cursed by self-destructive alcoholism and a true libertine’s taste for sexual adventure and excess, and died badly of drink and syphilis at the age of 33.&nbsp; The recent Johnny Depp movie (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375920/"><em><strong>The Libertine</strong></em></a>) over-simplified his life, as film biographies often do.&nbsp; He and Nell were fast friends, though apparently never lovers.&nbsp; Like her, Rochester was much loved by the King for his ability to entertain, and he was fascinated by the make-believe world of the playhouse where Nell reigned as comic queen.&nbsp; He was often her advisor in financial matters and her advocate with Charles, and she remained his loyal friend through his repeated disgraces and banishments from Court and his last, consuming illness.&nbsp; I found it fascinating that the same man who wrote some of the most pornographic and bitter poetry about women to be found in English literature could also be so close to a woman like Nell, and their unusual friendship was an important stabilizer in both their lives.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> You’ve spent quite a bit of time in the Restoration era.&nbsp; In researching Nell’s story, did you come across anything that surprised or intrigued you?&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Susan:</em></span> I think I’ve probably had the same experience as most other writers do who love the past: the more you learn, the more you realize how little you still know.&nbsp; The Restoration is a delicious time in English history, straddling as it does the end of the middle ages and the beginning of the age of enlightenment.&nbsp; Traitors are still drawn and quartered, their heads stuck on spikes on London Bridge, yet Christopher Wren is rebuilding London into a modern city and Isaac Newton is making revolutionary scientific discoveries.&nbsp; Much like the Regency era 150 years in the future, the Restoration is a time of tremendous social instability and change, with a mercantile middle class increasing its power while the aristocracy is feeling the first pinch of waning influence.&nbsp; Add to this unforgettable people like King Charles, Nell Gwyn, and Lord Rochester, and it’s an irresistible setting for any historical novelist.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000cc;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> <em><strong>The King’s Favorite</strong></em> offers us a number of glimpses of Louise de Keroualle, a detested rival of Nell’s whose story you’ll be telling in <em><strong>The French Mistress</strong></em>.&nbsp; Would you give us a preview of this book?&nbsp; <br />.<br /><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/22/louise.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=987,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="150" height="185" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/06/22/louise.jpg" alt="Louise" title="Louise" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Susan:</em></span>&nbsp; Louise de Keroualle (in the painting to the left) was Charles’s last “official” mistress, a lovely French lady whose plump cheeks so delighted Charles that he fondly nicknamed her Fubbs.&nbsp; The average Englishman was not as charmed: Louise was so despised that she dared not travel around London unattended.&nbsp; She was loathed as being greedy, petulant, and, worst of all, for being French.&nbsp; But Louise was far more complicated than that, and more intriguing, too.&nbsp; Born to a genteel French family, she was sent by King Louis as a “gift” to his cousin Charles, and a spy for the French.&nbsp; No one ever expected her to find a lasting place in Charles’s heart, and in English history as well.&nbsp; Click here for a preview of <a href="http://www.susanhollowayscott.com/books/mistresspreview.htm"><em><strong>The French Mistress</strong></em></a>, scheduled for publication next summer.</p>

By Susan/Miranda</p>

<p>Here at the Wenches, we like to discuss covers.&nbsp; We talk about covers we’ve had (<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2006/12/cover_girl.html#comments">Cover Gir</a>l) and covers we wish we had (<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2008/05/susan-sarah-her.html#comments">A Makeover for Lady M</a>). Our covers, other authors’ covers (<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2007/09/art-vs-commerce.html#comments">Art vs. Commerce</a>), good covers, bad covers, and really, really ugly covers.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect much of our fascination with covers is that authors often have very little input into what goes on the front of our books.&nbsp; We open those jpg files from art directors with great trepidation, each time hoping against hope that we got a “good one.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>So imagine my surprise to see that the subject of cover-art is suddenly considered big-time news in the rest of the (non-Wench) world.&nbsp; There it was, in the Philadelphia<strong> <em>Inquire</em>r</strong>, the third-oldest surviving newspaper in the country, a venerable journal that has won eighteen Pulitzer Prizes –– there, on the front page of the section, a bold-faced headline that couldn’t be missed:</p>

<p><strong>These book covers say women are dumb</strong><br /> </p>



<p>Well! Not much grey area in a headline like that, is there?&nbsp; The article that followed was written by one of the <strong><em>Inquirer’s</em></strong> most popular columnists, Karen Heller, and here’s the<a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/18396189.html"> link</a> so you can read it yourself.&nbsp; </p>

<p>On first reading, I completely agreed with Ms. Heller.&nbsp; I, too, am heartily sick of the cover-art conventions<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=85,height=129,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/11/jenniferweiner.jpeg"><img width="85" height="129" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/05/11/jenniferweiner.jpeg" title="Jenniferweiner" alt="Jenniferweiner" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 for books targeted towards women readers, from cheesy clinches to empty Adirondack chairs to the random, faceless body parts favored for chick-lit.&nbsp; (Yes, I know, my last two covers have featured headless women, and yes, I would have preferred they have had heads, and we’ll leave it at that.)&nbsp; </p>

<p>I also agree that a writer’s entire career can be determined by the pigeon-hole of a cover.&nbsp; Consider all the fantastic books out there that will never even be seen by a wider audience, let alone purchased or read, because they have the single word “romance” printed on the spine, and a “romance” cover on the front.&nbsp; (A good many excellent Wench books would surely fall into this category.)&nbsp; Ditto “women’s fiction.”&nbsp; Why are so many women writers singled out and branded like that?&nbsp; Books like <em><strong>The Notebook</strong></em> by Nicholas Sparks or <em><strong>Love Story</strong></em> by Erich Segal or even <em><strong>Anna Karenina</strong></em> by Leo Tolstoy aren’t labeled women’s fiction, though in theory they could be. They’re just fiction, suitable for all readers, and not banished to the “girl ghetto” section.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=126,height=193,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/11/louiseerdrich.jpg"><img width="85" height="130" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/05/11/louiseerdrich.jpg" title="Louiseerdrich" alt="Louiseerdrich" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
It’s worked in reverse as well.&nbsp; Consider an author like Louise Erdrich, whose complex, spiritual novels of families and lovers evolve from her own Chippewa heritage.&nbsp; Currently she’s regarded as one of the most important American novelists of her generation, and deserves to be, too. But what would have happened to her career if, in the beginning, some misguided art director had given her a “western romance” type cover?&nbsp; Would she have ever found her audience of both male and female readers, and the literary reputation that’s come with it? (OK, so most likely she would, but in the wonderful world of publishing, believe me, ANYTHING is possible.)</p>

<p>I was getting up a righteous head of steam to match Ms. Heller’s, with all kinds of proof to back it up.&nbsp; But then I began to think a bit further, and realized it’s not quite so easy to win the argument with feminist indignation.</p>

<p>Because women DO read more than men, and buy many more books than men, too.&nbsp; Every bookseller will<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=174,height=280,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/11/countess.jpg"><img width="85" height="136" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/05/11/countess.jpg" title="Countess" alt="Countess" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 tell you that.&nbsp; Therefore tailoring cover art to the biggest possible readership makes sense, doesn’t it?&nbsp; And if romance-reading-women-readers are the largest group of book-buyers, then offering them books that look like every other book they’ve already bought and enjoyed –– books that tell them in an instant what's inside –– is good business sense, isn’t it?&nbsp; Why fix it if it ain’t broke?</p>

<p>As the wise man says, I dunno.&nbsp; But maybe you do, or at least you’ll have an opinion you’d like to share. </p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do you agree with Ms. Heller that these book covers say women are dumb?&nbsp; Is it demeaning to women readers and writers to have such “<em>Lifetime</em> fuzz” (Ms. Heller’s term) and other hearts-and-flowers-Barbie-pink clichés on the covers of our books?&nbsp; Or is it just smart marketing?</span></p>

By Susan/Miranda</p>

<p>When Wench Pat recently asked the eternal question of “<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2008/04/what-do-we-real.html#comments"><strong>What Do We Really Wan</strong></a>t?”, one of the popular replies was a call for more humor.&nbsp; I can understand this.&nbsp; Who doesn’t want to laugh?&nbsp; Yet a truly funny book is truly hard to find, and historical-funny is even more rare.</p>

<p>And boy, is it ever hard to write! </p>

<p>The hero’s best friend is killed at Waterloo, and it’s terribly tragic and sad, and everyone knows to feel that way.&nbsp; The long-suffering couple finally weds, and readers share their joy.&nbsp; Those are easy.&nbsp; But humor is infinitely more subjective.&nbsp; A scene that strikes one reader as uproariously funny seems irritatingly foolish to another.&nbsp; Readers boards are filled with examples of this.&nbsp; Either you get the joke, or you don’t, or maybe the joke wasn’t really there in the first place, anyway.</p>

<p>Historical humor is even more challenging, because much of what was rip-snorting good fun in the past –– ridiculing the handicapped, huge fake penises, anything with priests and nuns –– doesn’t exactly fly in polite company now. </p>

<p>Wit and wordplay hold up better on the printed page than broad slapstick, but even then there are plenty of pitfalls amongst the pratfalls.&nbsp; Much humor is topical, or at least of its moment, and when the moment is past, so is the humor.&nbsp; Anyone who’s labored through Shakespeare’s comedies understands this, though, to be fair, an Elizabethan audience would be left scratching their heads over an episode of <strong><em>Seinfeld.</em></strong></p>

<p>Writing a funny historical character was my biggest challenge in <a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=sr_1_3/104-3951323-1487960?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193507505&amp;sr=1-3"><em><strong>The King’s Favorite</strong></em></a>, a historical novel set<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=83,height=135,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/22/drolls.jpeg"><img width="149" height="243" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/04/22/drolls.jpeg" title="Drolls" alt="Drolls" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 in Restoration London.&nbsp; By all contemporary reports, Nell Gwyn (my real-life heroine) was uproariously funny, a class-clown personality that couldn’t resist making people laugh.&nbsp; Born in a brothel, she had no education beyond “street smarts”, yet through the gift of quick wit, rose from selling oranges in the theatre to become a leading lady and, eventually, a royal mistress. As an actress, she was hugely popular playing “low” comedy: she was always cast as the sly servant with the best one-liners, the comedienne who knew how to get the most out of the earthy, physical humor of the time.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The King adored her, in large part because she’d dare to do and say things to him in the guise of a joke that no one else at court could risk, not without a quick trip to the Tower.&nbsp; Humor can be subversive that way, and Nell knew the power her wit gave her.&nbsp; To many men, a funny woman is a dangerous woman.&nbsp; She’s unpredictable, she has opinions, and she’s often quick to deflate male pride and vanities.&nbsp; But other men find a funny woman a sexy woman, and Nell’s house was always filled with her many male side-kicks, including the Earl of Rochester and the Duke of Buckingham, who were both always ready to participate in her elaborate pranks and skits.</p>

<p>To Nell’s good fortune, Charles was also secure enough himself to relish a witty mistress. (Remember, this is the first English monarch to realize that women on the stage were not a sign of moral civilization's end, and finally permit actresses to play the roles written for women.) Though the official post of court jester was gone by 1670, Nell held it unofficially, and whenever things were grim and gloomy about the palace, the king would always turn to her to cheer him.&nbsp; Even after he moved on to other mistresses, Nelly remained his friend and jester until his death.&nbsp; Her audience from the theatre never forgot her, either.&nbsp; Long after she &quot;retired&quot; from the stage to the palace, she was still cheered wherever she went, and when she died, her mourners filled not only the church, but the streets as well.</p>

<p>But how to write a funny heroine? One of Nell’s most famous roles was Mirida in a play called <em><strong>All Mistaken, or The Mad Couple</strong></em>, by James Howard. The humor comes from her suitor Pinguister’s enormous girth, and his inability to do much of anything with Mirida because of his obesity.&nbsp; If the actor rolling around the stage <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=144,height=104,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/22/restoration_theatre.jpeg"><img width="150" height="108" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/04/22/restoration_theatre.jpeg" title="Restoration_theatre" alt="Restoration_theatre" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
in the “fat suit” as he tries to catch Mirida wasn’t enough, there’s also the scene where Pinguister is given an enema and a laxative, then locked in a vault with other hapless suitors, and with predictable results.&nbsp; Oh, the hilarity! Oh, the [adolescent-boys-lavatory] wit!&nbsp; Oh, how am I supposed to write THAT into a scene! </p>

<p>Of course, not all Restoration wit is like this –- much of it was, and remains, laugh-out-loud clever word-play –– but an awful lot hasn’t aged very well.&nbsp; Or, as Wench Loretta noted when we were discussing this blog, “They drank a lot back then, didn’t they?”&nbsp; Fortunately, there are a great many other examples of Nell's one-liners and general jesting that hold up better over time, and that I was able to incorporate into her character.&nbsp; Virtuous heroines, sentimental heroines, noble, true-hearted heroines –– they're easy.&nbsp; But a funny heroine's a real rarity, and I know how lucky I am to have found Nell Gwyn.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But what do you think of humor in historical fiction?&nbsp; Do you enjoy funny characters or situations, or do you find the risk not worth the punchlines?&nbsp; What’s your favorite historical with humor?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The jury’s still out on whether or not I was able to capture the fun and wit of Nell Gwyn until <em><strong>The King’s Favorite</strong></em> is released in July –– except for one of you lucky folk out there.&nbsp; I’ll give away an Advanced Reader’s Copy of <em><strong>The King’s Favorite</strong></em> to a reader who posts to this blog before Saturday night.</span></p>

<p>Since it's the second of &quot;my&quot; days, I decided to share a response from a question I'd posed in an earlier blog.&nbsp; All the WordWenches blogs remain available on-line, and they can be accessed either in order, or by individual Wench (just click on a name at the end of an entry, and you'll get them all.)&nbsp; Readers also continue to post replies, sometimes days or even months after the blog first appeared.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Last fall, I wrote a blog called <a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2007/10/whither-bagnigg.html#comments">&quot;Whither Bagnigge?&quot;</a>&nbsp; I'd recently written a scene (included in the blog) for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=sr_1_3/104-3951323-1487960?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193507505&amp;sr=1-3">The King's Favorite</a>, which was set in a rural&nbsp; town called Bagnigge Wells, located on a branch of the Thames.&nbsp; As is sadly often the case, the rural resort of 1670 where Charles II went swimming with Nell Gwyn was soon after absorbed by London's sprawling growth, with even the river covered over and forgotten.&nbsp; I'd found plenty of references to the place in the past, but it was so long gone that it no longer appeared on any modern (or even 19th century) maps.&nbsp; I asked readers two questions: if they knew exactly where Bagnigge Wells might have been, and also, exactly how it would have been pronounced.</p>

<p>And now, some months later, I've heard from an English gentleman named Robert Mitchell who answered both questions, plus added a family photograph as well.&nbsp; His reply: &quot;If you search for &quot;gwynne place&quot; on wikimedia commons [here's the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Gwynne_place_riceyman_steps_1924.jpg">link</a>] you will find a photograph that I have posted that might interest you. Bagnigge is pronounced &quot;Bagg-nidge&quot;. The girl on the steps is probably my mum, though we'll never know for sure.&quot;&nbsp; Mr. Mitchell's great-grandfather was the landlord of the Bagnigge Wells public house, from whose window the photograph was taken in the early 1920s.<br /> </p>

<p>Thank you so much for sharing, Mr. Mitchell!&nbsp; And ain't the great wide world of the internet grand? *G*</p>

<p>Three things to know about me (at least in relation to this blog):<br />1) I like words.<br />2) I like history.<br />3) I like textiles.</p>

<p>Textiles (you know, cloth) like Rodney Dangerfield, never getting no respect.&nbsp; The more literary the fiction, the fewer words will be squandered on describing who wears what. Characters are dressed, or not dressed, and that’s about it.&nbsp; Conversely, the most sniggering parodies of “lady writers” will inevitably include a detailed list of the heroine’s closet, complete with designers’ names.&nbsp; (“She tossed her Blackberry into her Prada bag, along with her Marc Jacob sunglasses, Coach wallet, Cross pen, and Hermes scarf.”)</p>

<p>Historical fiction often gets the double whammy.&nbsp; Too many adjectives will be used to describe too much clothing, but using modern words and woeful history.&nbsp; I’ve already written here about the sad, inaccurate state of “historical” men’s shirts (a chorus, please, Kalen!), especially the ones make of silk that button down the front.&nbsp; But the ladies seldom fare much better.&nbsp; Think of all the Regency misses who wear high-waisted white cotton dress with puffed sleeves, which makes for boring writing and history.</p>

<p>There’s so much more that can be said about how a character dresses.&nbsp; It’s how she presents herself to<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/08/yellowregencydress_2.jpeg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=63,height=130,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="75" height="154" border="0" alt="Yellowregencydress_2" title="Yellowregencydress_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/04/08/yellowregencydress_2.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>

 the world. (It’s how he does, too, but to save blog verbiage, I’ll stick to the ladies for now.)&nbsp; It determines how she moves, even if she moves.&nbsp; Dress can show a character’s rank, income, job, marital status, religious beliefs, and sensuality.&nbsp; It can be a symbol of honor, or a brand of poverty, and it can reflect whether she’s a neatnik or a slob.&nbsp; It can show political beliefs, or stunning insensitivity, whether she dresses to attract men, or rebuff them.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It’s obvious that a lady in a jewel-studded brocade gown will move far differently than her maid in linsey-woolsey.&nbsp; But even an 18th century farmer’s wife would have tucked up her skirts and secured them through the slits for her pockets to keep her best glazed-wool petticoat clear of the mud in her yard while doing chores, and nearly every woman of every rank would cover her “good” clothes with an apron while doing any slightly messy task.</p>

<p>An 18th century Englishman’s shirt would have been made of linen, with virtually no exceptions.&nbsp; But was the gentleman supporting Irish manufactures with Irish linen?&nbsp; Did he care for style over politics, and buy Holland linen smuggled into London past trade embargos against the Netherlands?&nbsp; Or was he of the&nbsp; lower class or&nbsp; “middling sort”, who still relied on linen that was processed and sewn at home?&nbsp; One tidy adjective can say so much.</p>

<p>Careless writers will always put the common folk in cotton, reflecting the modern price (and often contempt) of this fiber.&nbsp; But in 1800, before the cotton gin, cotton could be costly, reflecting either its complicated manufacture or its import from India.&nbsp; Complicating things further for historians, “cotton” was also used to describe a process that raised a fuzzy nap on woolen cloth (“cottoning”), so often cotton isn’t cotton at all, but wool.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/08/milliner_2.jpeg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=110,height=99,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="120" height="108" border="0" alt="Milliner_2" title="Milliner_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/04/08/milliner_2.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
 A late 18th-century woman looking over bolts or pieces of fabric in a shop would definitely have understood the differences.&nbsp; She would know that <strong>ballasor,</strong> imported from India, was a cotton muslin suitable for her husband’s hankerchiefs, while&nbsp; <strong>balzarine</strong> was a light-weight brocade for day gowns, a blend of worsted wool and cotton woven into fanciful patterns on a jacquard loom.&nbsp; She would have requested <strong>beaverteen</strong> (a coarse, heavy, cotton twill with a thick pile) for her sons’ winter jackets.&nbsp; She might have bought several lengths of <strong>Canterbury</strong> (an old-fashioned cotton brocade with a silk warp, named after the city where it was first woven) for a gown for her widowed mother-in-law.&nbsp; She would have chosen <strong>jaconet</strong> (a thin woven cotton, between cambric and muslin) for infants’ clothes and caps, and perhaps a quantity of striped <strong>siamoise</strong> (a light but sturdy cloth, woven of linen and cotton) for summer slip coverings and bed hangings.&nbsp; All cotton, yes, but all as different as can be, and while the fine distinctions between the fabrics may be lost to us, the words themselves are evocative of a different time. </p>

<p>Consider the textiles of the more recent past.&nbsp; Dotted Swiss and cotton velveteen are forever the itchy,<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/08/50s_girls.jpeg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=91,height=111,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="121" border="0" alt="50s_girls" title="50s_girls" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/04/08/50s_girls.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 unyielding fabrics of Sunday dresses from my childhood.&nbsp; Kettle cloth and wide-wale corduroy were what we all sewed into shift dresses and jumpers in Home Economics classes back in the 60s, when Home Ec was still Home Ec and not Family &amp; Consumer Sciences.&nbsp; The first of the slinky synthetic knits were appearing then, too, in Orlon, and in Banlon, that creepiest of all fabrics for men’s shirts. Say Quiana and Ultrasuede and polyester-double-knit, and it’s instantly the 70s.&nbsp; Today it’s matte jersey and ramie and Tencel and Polarfleece, and Lycra laced through everything.&nbsp; And just consider all the subtle variations today in cotton denim: sand-blasted, stone-washed, and double-dip-dyed, from snow to chambray to midnight.</p>

<p>So please, my fellow writers. I know that one writer's (and reader's) perfect telling historical
detail can be another's &quot;infodump&quot; (and is there any more inelegant, disparaging
scrap of jargon than that?)&nbsp; I’m not asking for the entire inventory of the dry goods store or milliners’ shop.&nbsp; Just don’t call everything cotton!</p>

<p>I can’t leave historical textiles alone without mentioning the two best sources out there, for readers, writers, and collectors.&nbsp; First is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Textiles-America-1650-1870-Florence-Montgomery/dp/039373224X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1207590440&amp;sr=1-1"><em><strong>Textiles in America 1650-1870</strong></em></a>, by Florence M. Montgomery. Written by a curator of textiles at Winterthur thirty years ago, this has recently been reissued (though with a horrible cover).&nbsp; While the title implies an American bias, most of the quotes from primary sources are English.&nbsp; There’s an excellent glossary of textiles, and the photographs are most useful.&nbsp; But textiles are a tactile pleasure as much as a visual and historical one, and for that the series of publications from costume historians <a href="http://www.sallyqueenassociates.com/products.htm"><em><strong>Sally Queen Associates</strong></em></a> are unrivaled.&nbsp; While smaller in scope, the spiral-bound pages of these books are illustrated with 3x3 swatches of actual fabric. (Think <em><strong>Pat the Bunny</strong></em> for historians.)&nbsp; Available books in the series include the 18th century, Regency era, and Victorian.&nbsp; The next time you read about nankeen, you’ll KNOW what it feels like.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Any other fabric-lovers out there that have to touch everything? Do heroes in silk shirts bug you, too, or do you think I'm being hopelessly picky?&nbsp; And did anyone else struggle through sewing classes in high school, or do you still find pleasure in turning a length of cloth into something to wear? </span></p>

By Susan/Miranda </p>

<p>If the book you’re reading now didn’t have an author’s name on the cover, could you tell if it was written by a woman, or a man?</p>

<p>This is a heated question in my house, with both a male and a female reader (aka my DH and me) ready to jump into the fray.&nbsp; I maintain that in too many books written by men, the female characters are perfunctory stereotypes at best, placekeepers of the worst sort: the hero’s overbearing mother, his girlfriend of the moment, his young daughter in jeopardy, the sweet old lady downstairs who’s murdered, the vixen of a villainess.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We’re not just discussing manly genre books (otherwise locally known as “Dad’s boom-booms”), either. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=136,height=178,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/22/girlsroom.jpg"><img width="90" height="117" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/22/girlsroom.jpg" title="Girlsroom" alt="Girlsroom" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 There are plenty of well-regarded male writers, past and present, who seem to falter when it comes to creating women worthy of their heroes.&nbsp; Too often there’s a hollowness to the heroine, a lack of emotional depth that, as a female reader, I instantly sense.&nbsp; Somehow these women just don’t behave <em>right.</em></p>

<p>But turn-around’s fair play, and my DH says exactly the same thing about many of the books I like by women authors (including, alas, a number of my writer-friends).&nbsp; He’ll concede that the writing’s first-rate, the plot’s well-paced, the research is everything you’d want to <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=132,height=178,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/22/boysroom.jpg"><img width="90" height="121" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/22/boysroom.jpg" title="Boysroom" alt="Boysroom" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
support the story, but the hero –– well, he has no use at all for the heroes.&nbsp; He claims they’re too sensitive, too thoughtful, too reflective, too downright talky, to be real.&nbsp; Worse, he says that the harder a female writer tries to write a tough-guy, the more false the poor shmoo will ring to a male readers ears.</p>

<p>As a writer, I know it’s not easy to create ANY character, regardless of the gender.&nbsp; I’ve lived my whole life among menfolk, but I still can’t begin to know all the laws of their particular planet.&nbsp; Whenever (and writing romance, you know it’s not often) I hear from a male reader, praising something that one of my heros did or thought, I’m overjoyed, and relieved, too.&nbsp; It’s a tricky challenge to make work.&nbsp; One of the things I like best about writing novels&nbsp; in the first person (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=sr_1_3/104-3951323-1487960?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193507505&amp;sr=1-3"><em><strong>King's Favorite</strong></em></a> and <a href="www.amazon.com/Duchess-Churchill-Susan-Holloway-Scott/dp/0451218558/ref=sr_oe_1_1/104-7791204-9807106?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1187919884&amp;sr=1-1"><em><strong>Duchess)</strong></em></a> is that I can stay inside my heroine’s head, and leave the hero to think whatever “Man Show” thoughts he may choose, unassisted by me. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=67,height=95,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/22/womensroombabe.jpg"><img width="90" height="127" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/22/womensroombabe.jpg" title="Womensroombabe" alt="Womensroombabe" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 </p>

<p>But back to my reader-role.&nbsp; I’ll hasten to say that this gender-bias doesn’t hold true for every book.&nbsp; There ARE plenty of wonderful male characters written by women, and women written by men.&nbsp; &nbsp;But there are also too many of the other kind to be ignored.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I’m not talking about women writing behind a male pseudonym –– Georges-Sand-syndrome –– to gain respect from the literary establishment.&nbsp; Though, sadly, things haven’t changed that much since Marianne’s time, either, not if you count the number of favorable reviews for male-written books in the Sunday <em>New York Times Review</em> <em>of Books </em>versus the number by women-writers. If you’re a woman writing macho-commando books, you still better abbreviate your name into genderless initials if you want to sell in an equally-macho market, just as the handful of male romance <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=63,height=90,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/22/mensroombodybuilder.jpg"><img width="90" height="128" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/22/mensroombodybuilder.jpg" title="Mensroombodybuilder" alt="Mensroombodybuilder" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
writers publish their love stories under female pen-names.</p>

<p>No, I’m speaking as reader expressing certain, ahem, frustrations.&nbsp; Would Inman have fought through so much to return home only to die on his doorstep if <strong><em>Cold Mountain</em></strong> had been written by a woman?&nbsp; Wouldn’t a woman writer have given the namesake of <strong><em>Memoirs of Geisha</em></strong> a bit more emotional depth to balance out the fascinating history that filled the rest of the book?&nbsp; Couldn’t Horatio Hornblower have found true love with a woman who was less of a man than the weather-beaten Lady Barbara?&nbsp; And wasn’t there some way that&nbsp; <em><strong>Love Story</strong></em> could have remained a love story without killing off poor Jenny and leaving Oliver so pathetically adrift?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=40,height=148,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/22/mensroomgoofy.jpg"><img width="30" height="111" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/22/mensroomgoofy.jpg" title="Mensroomgoofy" alt="Mensroomgoofy" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>

What about you?&nbsp; Have you ever read a book where the writer betrayed her or his own gender by a

 lack of empathy or understanding for the characters playing on the other team?&nbsp; Have you ever wondered how differently a book would have been written by a man –– or a woman?&nbsp; Or do you think this is all a bunch o’ hooey, and there’s no difference at all?</span></p>

<p>Last month, Wench Loretta’s blog <a href="http://http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2008/02/too-young-to-ma.html#comments"><strong>Too Young to Marry?</strong></a> began a fascinating discussion about the ages of our historical heroines, and whether the young women of the past were more mature at an earlier age and better prepared to assume adult responsibilities than their contemporaries today.</p>

<p>There were many different examples given of young women, both from history and from fiction, a most capable bunch.&nbsp; But the more I thought about this question, the more I realized how all the young women we mentioned, whether from the American west or a Jane Austen novel, all had a certain level of family support and education to help them on their way.&nbsp; <em><strong>Jane Eyre</strong></em> was an orphan, but educated well enough to become a governess.&nbsp; The women in <strong><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></strong> are said to have been left paupers when Mr. Dashwood died, yet there is poor, and there is poor, and the Dashwoods’ degree of poverty still allowed for a handsome “cottage” and a servant or two.</p>

<p>In male-oriented fiction, real rags-to-riches stories abound.&nbsp; The orphan from the workhouse becomes the<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/06/sensesensibilty.jpeg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=122,height=123,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="125" height="126" border="0" alt="Sensesensibilty" title="Sensesensibilty" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/06/sensesensibilty.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 industrious apprentice who marries the master’s daughter and eventually owns the business.&nbsp; The barefoot cabin-boy toils at his navigation and works his way up through the ranks to become an admiral.&nbsp; The immigrant son learns English, puts himself through law school while working two jobs to support his widowed mother, becomes a crusading district attorney, and finally governor.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But where are the girls?&nbsp; Before the twentieth century made education more universal for women, there were many more girls starting life in sweatshop factories, dairies, and as servants than those sharing the comfortable “plight” of the Dashwood sisters.&nbsp; Granted, the sexism and prejudice of the past would have made it quite challenging for a poor girl to work her way upwards to prosperity, yet it did occasionally happen.&nbsp; Industrious, low-born women did become master silversmiths, cooks in great houses, and owners of prosperous inns and shops, though never to the same giddy heights of success that men could.&nbsp; Of course the surest way for a woman to rise was on the coattails of a man, as a wife or a mistress, but even then in reality there were very few peers willing to play Henry Higgins for the sake of an aspiring Eliza Doolittles from the street.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/06/my_fair_lady.jpeg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=96,height=125,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="125" height="162" border="0" alt="My_fair_lady" title="My_fair_lady" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/06/my_fair_lady.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
So why aren’t there more in fiction beyond Becky Sharpe in <em><strong>Vanity Fair</strong></em> and <em><strong>The Unsinkable Molly Brown</strong></em>?&nbsp; We writers are supposed to be in the business of dreams and escape and giddy “what if.”&nbsp; Why don’t more girls get the Horatio Alger treatment?&nbsp; In much contemporary women’s fiction, the message is even worse.&nbsp; The heroines do get the chance to work hard to achieve success –– power, glamour, careers, wealth –– but their success seems only to make them miserable in a way that never affects heroes.&nbsp; The only way these heroines can be truly happy is to return to their humble roots in the decaying small town/low-paying job/high school crush that they’d worked so hard to escape in the first place.&nbsp; They’re almost like cautionary tales against dreaming too high.&nbsp; Heck, look what happened to enterprising Mildred Pierce and her pie-shops!</p>

<p>But, as usual, I digress.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have to admit that I’d never written a true rags-to-riches heroine myself.&nbsp; Oh, I’ve done a couple that came close, a fisherman’s daughter and a seamstress, but never anyone who starts out with every card stacked against her.&nbsp; Which is one of the reasons I was so captivated by Nell Gwyn, the 17th century woman whose life forms the story of my next historical novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=sr_1_3/104-3951323-1487960?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193507505&amp;sr=1-3"><em><strong>The King’s Favorite</strong></em></a>, due out this summer.</p>

<p>Born in Oxford in 1650, Nell was the illegitimate daughter of a soldier and camp-follower.&nbsp; When her father was killed in the English Civil War, her mother moved to London with Nell and her older sister, where they lived above the brothel where the mother worked.&nbsp; By any standard, it was an appalling childhood.&nbsp; Malnourished, illiterate, and beaten by her alcoholic mother, young Nell worked as a barefoot herring vendor in the street by day and served ale at the brothel by night.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But Nell was ambitious, and refused to follow the grim path taken by her mother and sister.&nbsp; She was<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/06/nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=500,height=612,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="125" height="153" border="0" alt="Nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed" title="Nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/03/06/nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 determined to do better for herself in the raucous world of 17th century London.&nbsp; She was clever, funny, and charming, a talented singer and dancer, and blessed (or cursed) with an almost insatiable need for an audience to entertain.&nbsp; By fifteen, she was selling oranges in the new Theatre Royal and bantering&nbsp; merrily with lords and peers.&nbsp; A year later, she was one of the first actresses on the English stage.&nbsp; Before her twentieth birthday, she’d made herself a headlining star, with plays written specifically to showcase her talents and crowds of fans cheering her wherever she went.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In a promiscuous era, Nell had only four lovers during her short life.&nbsp; The most famous, of course, was King Charles II, but she insisted on establishing a friendship between them long before she shared his bed –– likely the reason she was his lover for nearly fifteen years, until his death.&nbsp; Yet no matter how high Nell rose, she never forgot where she’d started, and remained as great a favorite with the common folk in the street as she was at the palace.&nbsp; Even today Nell Gwyn is something of a folk-hero in England, a splendid testimony to her “rags to riches” life, and a wonderful inspiration for me as I told her story.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is your memory for books better than mine?&nbsp; Can you name more true “rags to riches” heroines than I could?&nbsp; Do you admire such women, or would you rather your heroine came equipped with her silver spoon rather than have to earn it?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">Welcome back for Part Two of our interview with Wench Susan Fraser King, celebrating the publication of her new historical novel, <strong><a href="http://http://www.amazon.com/Lady-Macbeth-Susan-Fraser-King/dp/0307341747/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201825600&amp;sr=1-1">Lady Macbeth: A Novel</a>.</strong>&nbsp; Today Susan chats with the other Susan (fellow-Wench Susan/Miranda) about several topics that not only relate to her extraordinary book, but that are also near and dear to WordWenches readers--including the story behind the beautiful cover, and Gerard Butler. Read on, read on...and please be sure to leave a comment. </span><span style="color: #cc3300;">Susan will send a signed ARC of Lady Macbeth to a reader chosen from those who post (here or in Part One of the interview)!</span><span style="color: #003399;"><br /><br />SHS:</span><strong> Lady Macbeth</strong> is written in first person, yet you vary the tenses. Can you tell us why you chose to do that?</p>

<p><span style="color: #cc3300;">SFK:</span> I wrote the prologue and a couple of ending chapters in first person/present tense, and the rest of the book in first person/past tense. The first person/present tense worked well to frame her story in the present moment, when we see Gruadh, not yet old, looking back on her life from a pivotal moment of decision. The story swings back around to present time toward the end, when she must resolve her dilemma. I loved playing with the tenses, and actually had more of that in the manuscript….but my editor figured Less Is More. </p>

<p>And after writing several third-person/two viewpoint novels, I felt real freedom with the first person voice. It came easily, and parts of the book wrote very quickly because of it. Once I got inside the character's head, she did the talking, and all I had to do was type. Well, sort of. Luckily she had a lot to say about her time and her life.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">SHS:</span>&nbsp; <strong>Lady Macbeth</strong> has a beautiful dust jacket.&nbsp; Since we’re always fascinated by cover art here at the<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/26/queenemma.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=480,height=776,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="125" height="202" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/02/26/queenemma.jpg" alt="Queenemma" title="Queenemma" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> Wenches, could you tell us a bit about the art on your cover, and how it was chosen?</p>

<p><span style="color: #cc3300;">SFK</span>: Cover art, fun question! Gorgeous art covers are a staple of the bigger historicals, but there aren’t any conventionally beautiful portraits of 11th century women to choose from. The publisher thought early medieval art (such as The Bayeux Tapestry, which is more or less current to the novel) seemed too academic, including a rare image of an 11th c. queen, Queen Emma of England: an ink drawing for her encomium (praise book). I love it, with its Byzantine linear style and generic elements typical in 11th c. art; but has that academic feel. It also has a touch of medieval goofiness, an innocence of imagery prevalent in medieval art, but authentic 11th c. art was a no-go for the cover.</p>

<p>I yearned for a pre-Raphaelite cover, and bombarded my editor with images, but the publisher and art dept. wanted a different look. The first pass was a white silhouette of a raven on a branch against a dark background. Real different; that lasted about a week, since it evoked Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth, not mine. The next cover, a castle with a hawk in flight, is on the ARCs. Later the art dept. removed the hawk, saturated the colors, enlarged and clarified the whole image.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/26/eilean_donan_ii_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=528,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="130" height="85" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/02/26/eilean_donan_ii_2.jpg" alt="Eilean_donan_ii_2" title="Eilean_donan_ii_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>The final cover is beautiful, I think, and evokes the book’s atmosphere, though there are no stone castles in the story. The castle is Eilean Donan, which is probably THE most photographed castle in Scotland. I’ve taken many photos of it myself from that same angle (standing in the car park, with the gift shop off to the right!). Familiarity aside, I think it works very well for this book, and the golden sky looks great. The overall presentation is lovely, with Celtic design touches and quality details. <span style="color: #cc3300;">(Has anyone seen the extra detail under the jacket??)</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">SHS: </span>The role of Lady Macbeth in Shakespeare’s play has been a favorite of many great actresses ever<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/26/gerard_butler.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=448,height=336,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="171" height="128" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/02/26/gerard_butler.jpg" alt="Gerard_butler" title="Gerard_butler" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> since it was written.&nbsp; If you were casting Gruadh, what actress would you choose to play her?&nbsp; Any ideas of who’d make a good Macbeth?</p>

<p><span style="color: #cc3300;">SFK:</span> This story would be such a cool movie…as long as I’m daydreaming, I can think of several choices in Hollywood, but many of them are *cough* a bit too old for the roles. The obvious choices for Lady Gruadh might be Keira Knightley or Scarlett Johanssen, since Rue is a very young woman for much of the book. Though I’d love to see Sophia Myles (who played Isolde in Tristan and Isolde – just redo that movie into Lady Macbeth, and I’d be happy!), or even Michelle Williams, who has strength and grace (come to think of it, Heath Ledger, gone far too soon, would have been a great young <a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/26/sophia_myles.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=150,height=225,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="125" height="187" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/02/26/sophia_myles.jpg" alt="Sophia_myles" title="Sophia_myles" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>Macbeth). My yummiest picks for Macbeth would be Jude Law, Russell Crowe, or Gerard Butler—I think they’re all suited for him. Daniel Day-Lewis would be a great Thorfin the Raven-Feeder (Macbeth's cousin and Lady Macbeth's foe)!</p>

<p>So my picks would be Sophia Myles and Gerard Butler, I think. <span style="color: #cc3300;">I’d love to know what you all think -- which actors would fit Macbeth and Lady Gruadh?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">SHS:</span> Do you see any sequels to Lady Macbeth, following other characters from the book?&nbsp; What’s next for Susan Fraser King?</p>

<p><span style="color: #cc3300;">SFK:</span> I’m working on a novel about the queen who followed Lady Macbeth on the throne of Scotland—Queen Margaret of Scotland, the Saxon-Hungarian princess who married Malcolm Canmore, had eight children with him (six of them kings and queens), and was later declared a saint. Historians often regard her as one of the most fascinating and influential medieval queens—she almost singlehandedly brought Celtic Scotland into the medieval era—and in many ways she is the opposite of Lady Macbeth, who was essentially the last Celtic queen Scotland ever had. While Margaret was pious, she was not always saintly, and she had a lot of fire and individuality. And—unlike Gruoch’s single Latin document—we know tons about Margaret, thanks to her biographer, her personal priest Turgot (who himself was captured and tortured by Normans before escaping north to join her). He idolized Margaret, but he dished the dirt on her, too (she stole gold from Malcolm’s treasury and dressed as a guy to sneak into church, among other adventures).</p>

<p>And it will be a sequel, in a way, since I get to bring Lady Macbeth back in this book. Historically it’s unknown when she died; by the dates, she could have been around during Malcolm and Margaret’s reign. At the end of her novel, Gruadh has not entirely resolved her dilemma (as I said to my editor, “Years later, she’s probably still pissed at Malcolm,” to which she replied, “Woh yeah!”). Gruadh’s goal will be to find some closure, as we say in our century—or maybe a spot of revenge, with Queen/Saint Margaret standing in her way. Watch for the book!&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">Thank you, Susan.&nbsp; And please let me add that I've already had the great pleasure of reading Lady Macbeth, and I recommend it highly!&nbsp; For an excerpt, please check out <a href="http://www.susanfraserking.com/">Susan's web site</a>.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">A recent &quot;meeting of the Susans&quot; between Susan Fraser King (aka&nbsp; Wench Susan/Sarah) and Susan Holloway Scott (aka Wench Susan/Miranda) discussed <strong>Lady Macbeth</strong> (never named Susan, as far as I know) in all her delicious detail.&nbsp; Part One appears today, with Part Two to follow on Wednesday.&nbsp; As always, please feel free to ask additional questions that you may have.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">SHS:</span> How did you choose Lady Macbeth as your heroine? Have you wanted to tell “her” story for a long time, or did you come across the idea while researching another book?</p>

<p><span style="color: #cc3300;">SFK:</span> I’ve known for a long time that the historical Lady Macbeth, an 11th c. Scottish queen, was probably very different than the ambitious harridan of Shakespeare's play, but she didn't start blipping on my story radar until about three years ago. I was researching another medieval Scottish story and kept seeing references to Macbeth and Queen Gruoch. I got curious and followed the breadcrumbs, and realized that a few facts hid a story with real substance. Macbeth was treated by Dunnett and Tranter decades ago, and Lady Macbeth was a strong character in those stories, but I wanted to focus on her story and base it on updated history and what was possible for a Scottish woman in an age of Celts, Vikings and Saxons. The facts and possibilities were fascinating, and once I started to research and put ideas together, it developed pretty steadily from there. </p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">SHS:</span>&nbsp; You chose authentic Celtic names for your characters that will be unfamiliar to many readers.&nbsp; Can<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/24/triskele.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=125,height=125,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="130" height="130" border="0" alt="Triskele" title="Triskele" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/02/24/triskele.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> you tell us a bit about them, beginning with Gruadh, Lady Macbeth?</p>

<p><span style="color: #cc3300;">SFK:</span> Some of the names were determined by historical record, so I had no choice, and I did my best to simplify the Celtic and Gaelic names while retaining authenticity. For instance, Lady Macbeth’s father in historical accounts is Boite, Boete, Bode or Bodhe. The modern equivalent is “Boyd” … um, no thanks! So I settled for Bodhe. </p>

<p>Macbeth’s queen is identified in a Latin document as &quot;Gruoch filia Bodhe,&quot; or Gruoch, daughter of Bodhe, and she is also identified as Queen of Scots, and equal to Macbeth, and not a consort (a big clue to her lineage and rank). But “Gruoch” is not a known Gaelic female name, and appears only for this woman. It’s possibly a cleric's phonetic attempt at a Gaelic name. Although Gruoch is used by historians, I looked for a better alternative (besides, I kept typing “Grouch”). </p>

<p>Some genealogy charts listed her great-granddaughter as Gruaith or Gruadh, which is a legitimate Irish female name. Since it’s possible the child was named for her great-grandmother, a Queen of Scots, I used that for my Lady Macbeth. Though it could have been her actual name, no one seems to have made this connection before. I also gave Gruadh the nickname Rue, to spare the reader as well as the author.</p>

<p><span style="color: #cc3300;">SFK:</span> While you were writing your 17th century novels (your next one will be <em><strong>The King’s Favorite</strong></em>, about Nell Gwyn, from NAL in July 2008 -- Susan/Sarah’s plug for Susan/Miranda!) I was a bit envious of the fabulous, detailed sources you had for each woman—journals, diaries, letters, accounts of all kinds. Sigh!! The historical Lady Macbeth has one direct document to back her up. We don’t know a thing about her personally, and whatever historians and novelists come up with has to be inferred from evidence of the political circumstances around her, what is factually known of the men in her life, and what we know of the traditions of the Celtic society, women in particular; even things like what is known of the environment (the warming of a small ice age, the introduction of new crops, the trade routes, the structure of wooden fortresses, etc.) was very helpful to creating a picture of the woman.</p>

<p>The woman needed a strong voice to carry the book, and she couldn’t sound too modern. So I read widely in Celtic myth, poetry, chants, charms, and songs. I’ve done that for years anyway out of natural interest, since I love that area of myth and literature. That, and years of medieval studies, taught me the general voice of the times. </p>

<p>Whenever you read extensively in whatever era you’re writing about, you’ll naturally absorb the voice. By<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/24/celtic_kells_birds.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=551,height=760,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img border="0" alt="Celtic_kells_birds" title="Celtic_kells_birds" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/02/24/celtic_kells_birds.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right; width: 123px; height: 170px;" /></a> delving into Celtic lit, I absorbed cadence and phrasing, and little turns of phrase, all of which came in handy in creating Lady Gruadh’s voice. Years of work in medieval studies also helped me understand medieval phrasing and medieval opinions, which helped too. In the past few years I’ve also studied some Gaelic, which helped give me a sense of how the character might speak. I tried to keep in mind that whatever Lady Gruadh said would be “translated” into English for the modern reader. </p>

<p><span style="color: #003399;">SHS: Thank you, Susan (and thank you for the shout-out for Nell, too*g*)&nbsp; I hope all of you will please join us again on Wednesday for Part Two.&nbsp; And if you have any questions for Susan, please ask away!</span></p>

Hartley’s wonderful&#0160; <span style="COLOR: #3333cc"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Go-Between-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/0940322994/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201806666&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Go-Between</strong></a></span>): The past is like another country. They do things differently there.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t take much to rattle this kind of comfortable assumption.&#0160; To begin with, the Past isn’t really so very far away.&#0160; My grandmothers were born in the 1890s.&#0160; One of them clearly remembered the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, and both of them recalled nattering old uncles who’d fought in the Civil War.&#0160; It’s an easy genealogical hop backwards through my grandmothers’ grandmothers, and the War of 1812, and another set of grandmothers beyond that to reach the Revolution.&#0160; Farther back than that hurts my head to calculate, but the gist of my rambling is that it doesn’t take too many generations to encompass all of American history.</p>
<p>Of course, the Past isn’t limited to Manifest Destiny and other high-concept historical facts.&#0160; It’s every-day stuff, too.&#0160; My teenaged daughter can’t believe that my high school yearbook features a page honoring the Future Homemakers of America club, but nary a word about girls varsity sports teams –– which is, of course, because there weren’t any.&#0160; To her, life before Title IX seems as remote as the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock.</p>
<p>The other morning, Turner Classic Movies was showing a silent John Barrymore movie from the early 1920s<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/31/beaubrummel192401.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=250,height=184,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false"><img alt="Beaubrummel192401" border="0" height="95" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/01/31/beaubrummel192401.jpg" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" title="Beaubrummel192401" width="130" /></a>, with Barrymore playing <a href="http://www.typepad.com/site/blogs/6a00d8341c84c753ef00d83451e58f69e2/post/6a00d8341c84c753ef00e5501aa22d8834/www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?scarlettTitleId=338558">Beau Brummell</a>.&#0160; The Roaring Twenties somehow don’t seem that long ago to me (perhaps because that’s when my parents were born?), but Regency England does.&#0160; Yet the number of years between us and John Barrymore is roughly the same as between Barrymore and Brummell.&#0160; Whoa!</p>
<p>Historian Antonia Fraser delights in “link-with-history anecdotes.” In <a href="http://http//www.amazon.com/Royal-Charles-Antonia-Fraser/dp/039449721X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201806768&amp;sr=1-2">Royal Charles</a>, her biography of Charles II, she describes one: “Dr. Martin Routh, President of Magdalene College, who died in 1854 in his hundredth year, used to say that, when young, he had known an old lady who as a little girl had seen King Charles walking with his spaniels in Oxford.” Fraser concludes that she herself, “as a child living in Oxford in the 1930s, likes to think she might have known someone old enough to have met Dr. Routh.”</p>
<p>My brother-in-law’s family emigrated to America from Ireland late in the 19th century.&#0160; While he has lived all his life in this country, he has visited Ireland many times, and still feels a deep connection to his family’s ties there.&#0160; Thanks to miracle of the internet (what ISN’T for sale on the internet?), he orders carefully prepared boxes of <a href="http://www.irishpeat.com/">peat</a> shipped to him, the same peat used for heating generations of Irish cottages –– literally pieces of the “old sod.” With great reverence, he’ll light a chunk outside on his deck, close his eyes, and let the distinctive scent carry him from suburban Connecticut back to the Ireland of his ancestors.&#0160; Less of a romantic, my sister-in-law forbids the peat-burning ritual inside the house, while their neighbors no doubt sniff the evening air suspiciously and consider calling the local authorities.&#0160; My brother-in-law doesn’t care: for him, that’s the scent of the Irish Past.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/02/03/weepingbeech.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=288,height=435,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false"><img alt="Weepingbeech" border="0" height="226" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/02/03/weepingbeech.jpg" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" title="Weepingbeech" width="150" /></a> One last example: On the road I travel almost daily is a worn landmark sign pointing towards a “Historic Weeping Beech Tree.”&#0160; Here outside of Philadelphia, landmark signs are everywhere, but this is the only one I know that commemorates a tree.&#0160; And yes, it’s definitely a very, very old tree, an enormous American weeping beech&#0160; that spreads and sprawls in every direction (a diameter of at least 100 feet, by my guess) with branches like serpentine vines.&#0160; This beech has been certified by the local historical society as having been planted in 1703, by a Scottish Quaker farmer named Alexander Bane on land that was part of William Penn&#39;s original grant.&#0160; Of course that Friend’s idyllic farm was long ago broken up and “developed”, the stone farmhouse torn down and the rolling fields around it replaced by suburban houses and an elementary school, with the four noisy lanes of Route 202 destroying any lingering hints of Quakerly peace.</p>
<p>But Alexander Bane&#39;s&#0160; tree remains.&#0160; Now over three hundred years old, it’s an aging, brittle survivor, isolated and surrounded by a chain-link fence to protect it from nefarious teenagers and tow-trucks headed for the auto repair shop across the street.&#0160; Yet standing beneath its twisting branches, I think of how an aging William Penn might have visited the Bane family&#39;s farm. He might well have sat on a nearby bench with Alexander, drinking cider brought out to the men by Jane Bane on a warm summer evening: the same William Penn who was often at Whitehall Palace in London, lobbying Charles II on behalf of his colonists in Pennsylvania, the same time and place for my historical fiction books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duchess-Churchill-Susan-Holloway-Scott/dp/0451218558/ref=sr_oe_1_1/104-7791204-9807106?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1187919884&amp;sr=1-1">(Duchess,</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Royal-Harlot-Countess-Castlemaine-Charles/dp/0451221346/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5199528-3381615?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178226602&amp;sr=1-1">Royal Harlot</a>, and <a href="http://http//www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=sr_1_3/104-3951323-1487960?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193507505&amp;sr=1-3">King&#39;s Favorite</a>).&#0160; Yeah, I know, it’s a stretch.&#0160; But when I look up at the leaves of that three-hundred-year-old tree, suddenly 17th century England doesn’t seem so long ago at all.</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: #ff3300">What about you?&#0160; Do you have something or some place that connects&#0160; you with the past?&#0160; What can carry you back: is it an old teacup that belonged to an ancestor, or a favorite hymn, or a nearby battlefield turned into a park?</span></p>

<p>As we’ve discussed here many times before, most of the heroes and a good many of the heroines in historical romances are wealthy, or at least comfortably off.&nbsp; Oh, there are the occasional governesses, poor relations, and fallen women sprinkled through the ranks of the heroines, but writers generally write what readers like to read, and that’s Characters Above the Middling Sort.</p>

<p>Not that I’m objecting.&nbsp; If one is reading to escape modern life for the late 18th century, then it’s far more enjoyable to end up in a sunny drawing room in a grand country house than to a noisy spot beside a clattering water-powered loom in a textile factory.&nbsp; Yet too often these affluent heroines (and their mothers and sisters) are depicted as frittering their days away: a little reading, a little music, a little riding, shopping, dressing, heading off to Almack’s, and, of course, a lot of doing whatever the hero is doing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In reality, most ladies of the time spent many hours each day in running their household.&nbsp; A house was like a small business in itself, with the lady of the house (usually the wife, but depending on circumstances, an older daughter, spinster sister or widowed aunt) as the CEO, with duties that included bookkeeping, purchasing, personnel, and receiving.&nbsp; Anyone who casually refers to the “idle rich” didn’t know these women, who could both micromanage the proper way to starch their husband’s shirts and oversee the large-scale social event that was a house-party at a country estate that would exhaust a score of modern professional wedding-planners.&nbsp; They were caretakers of the secret family recopies for pewter polish as well as Christmas puddings, and were as adept at hiring a French governess as they were with coping with a pregnant housemaids.</p>

<p>All of which is an introduction to one of my favorite research books, a slender volume (why are volumes always slender, and not simply skinny books?) reprinted by the National Trust for Historic Places.&nbsp; <strong>The Housekeeping Book of Susanna Whatman </strong>is a printed version of a handwritten guide kept by the wife of a wealthy paper-mill owner in the late 18th century.&nbsp; The Whatmans weren’t aristocrats, but part of the<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/18/turkey_mill_house_2.jpeg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=260,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="150" height="97" border="0" alt="Turkey_mill_house_2" title="Turkey_mill_house_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/01/18/turkey_mill_house_2.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> newly-rising upper-middle-class. Their home, Turkey Court, was near Maidstone, in Kent, began as a sizable three-story brick house, and as Mr. Whatman prospered, gradually expanded to include a larger, more imposing estate and house that included the family’s paper mills (The estate still exists, with the house rented out for weddings and the mills refurbished as office space –– that’s it to the right.)&nbsp; Their family had three children, and their staff included a governess, housekeeper, steward, butler, coachman, gardener, cook, six maids, and a half-dozen “odd men” (which referred not to their personalities, but to the diversity of their duties.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Whatman wasn’t writing her book for publication (like Hannah Glasse’s <strong>Servant’s Directory, or Housekeeper’s Companion</strong>, published first in 1760), but for her own use as a guide for her staff.&nbsp; Mrs. Whatman knew how things should be properly done, having served as the head of her father’s equally large household after her mother’s death.&nbsp; In her <strong>Housekeeping Book</strong>, she offers a fascinating glimpse at life in her house.</p>

<p>She expected her servants to be up early, and to bed late, having the rooms of the house ready and the fires set before the family came downstairs in the morning and yet remain awake to assist Mr. and Mrs. Whatman prepare for bed, however late that might be.&nbsp; She expected them to be industrious, too.&nbsp; The book outlines all the daily responsibilities for each servant, a staggering list.&nbsp; Even the cook, the comparative queen of the staff, had far more to do than simply prepare food:</p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/01/18/whatman_cover.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=150,height=234,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="125" height="195" border="0" alt="Whatman_cover" title="Whatman_cover" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2008/01/18/whatman_cover.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a><span style="color: #333366;">Cook must bake her bread in the mornings time enough for breakfast. She should bake Wednesdays and Saturdays, clean her Larder and Pantries Mondays and Fridays, and rise Tuesday to wash her own things. Thursday morning wipe her pewter . . . and iron her things instead of doing it in the evenings ...Cook should see that every saucepan, etc. is well cleaned within, but never scowered without, except the upper rim . . . [as she is also responsible for] filling the hog pails, washing up butter dishes and salad bowls, preserving the water in which meat is boiled, keeping all her places clean, managing her fire and her kitchen linens and keeping it mended.</span></p>

<p>The cook was also expected to oversee the lesser servants as Mrs. Whatman’s eyes in the kitchen: </p>

<p><span style="color: #333366;">Cook should see that heavy things are not set upon plates and dishes.&nbsp; She may always call back a servant whom she sees do it, or if they leave bones or hard things such as spoons in a dish, and then put other dishes on it . . . . As it is very wrong to lay temptation unnecessarily in the way of anyone, the large joints [of meat] should never be left open to the inferior servants . . . .This duty of keeping away temptation is very necessary, as it would be difficult to detect depredations on a large joint, and a dishonest servant might contract a habit of doing injustice.</span></p>

<p>In other words, no snacking on leftovers.&nbsp; But even with her own key to the wire safe with the roast joints, Cook still wasn’t the highest authority:</p>

<p><span style="color: #333366;">The Housekeeper ought always to be present, when the dinner is sent up.&nbsp; Otherwise the Cook is apt to relax, and be longer dishing than is necessary.</span></p>

<p>Yet as strict as Mrs. Whatman was about duties, she was also (comparatively) indulgent to her servants.&nbsp; They were permitted alternate Sundays off to attend church, given ale at their noon meals, and warm coverlets on their beds. “Broken victuals” (table scraps and leavings) didn’t wind up on the servants’ table, but were given to the deserving poor. The house had modern labor-saving devices such as a water-closet instead of chamber-pots, a mangle for pressing linen, and a range for cooking instead of an open hearth.&nbsp; She even took care with choosing the calico for the maids’ gowns: “It is a finer one than I should have given them, but it is so pretty, that [I am sure they] will fall in love with it as I did.”</p>

<p>The furnishings of a great house were of considerable value, and Mrs. Whatman was ever-vigilant about preserving her husband’s assets.&nbsp; There was a detailed daily schedule for opening and shutting each room’s Venetian blinds to prevent the sun from fading the furniture.&nbsp; Carpets were turned over and swept every few days to clean them, rather than using water, which caused the dyes to run.&nbsp; Mahogany pieces were rubbed, never waxed or polished, and special bellows were used to blow dust from intricate carvings.</p>

<p>Clearly Mr. Whatman’s library was his<em> sanctum sanctorum</em>.&nbsp; The books were to be dusted “only as far as the wing of a goose would go,” and never taken out or disarranged.&nbsp; Apparently with good reason, too, for there is a strained reference to a mislaid “philosophical index”, a casualty of an over-zealous maid: “I never saw her poor master so angry.”</p>

<p>We even learn how household bills were paid: “Mrs. Whatman pays all her house bills weekly, including the Butcher’s bills, and candles and flour when they are brought in.&nbsp; But soap, wax candles, and grocery come down from London, and are paid by draft by Mr. Whatman.” Perhaps most telling of Mrs. Whatman’s thrifty housekeeping is that, while Mr. Whatman’s income was around £6,000 annually, the family’s expenses never exceeded £2,000 –– so certain a recipe for household happiness that Mr. Micawber himself would applaud.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0033;">Do you enjoy these more homely details of everyday life in novels?&nbsp; Do you feel they add to the characters’ lives and stories, or would you rather read only about the more glamorous balls and dinners?</span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="color: #ff3300;">With the holidays now past us, we Wenches decided we’d welcome in the new year in a new way, with a look at how we each begin a book.&nbsp; There’s no right or wrong way, of course.&nbsp; Not only does every writer have her own method, but every book and set of characters seems to suggest something different as well.&nbsp; During our January blogs, we’ll each post the beginning to one of our favorite books, and explain how and why we chose to start the way we did.&nbsp; We tend to talk more about history and characters than the craft of writing here at the Wenches, so here’s the chance to ask that question you’ve always wondered, from why we opened with the hero’s point of view, or how we chose the historical time period for the setting. We’ll be giving away copies of the featured books to a randomly chosen reply, so please post away.<br /><br />And a happy, happy 2008 to you all!</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">I love beginning a new book.&nbsp; Just like that first day of school, the first page is full of opportunity and promise.&nbsp; On page one, every book’s a potential <em>NYT</em></span> best-seller.&nbsp; What’s not to love about that?</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">But then the decision-making begins.&nbsp; Choosing exactly when to begin a story can be more challenging than actually choosing the story itself.&nbsp; The book I’m using as my example is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Royal-Harlot-Countess-Castlemaine-Charles/dp/0451221346/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5199528-3381615?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178226602&amp;sr=1-1">Royal Harlot</a>, my fictionalized biography of Barbara Palmer, Countess of Castlemaine. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">When I write a romance, I know that the first chapter will most likely include the first meeting of the hero and the heroine.&nbsp; Of course they’ll have had experiences and adventures before then, all the things that make them real to me and, I hope to readers, but the focus of the book must be the love they find for one another.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">But writing about historical figures is different, and has its own special pitfalls.&nbsp; The story’s already there; I can’t go changing this war or that king to suit my plot.&nbsp; Instead I have to pick and choose the key events of the person’s life and times, and construct my conflicts and pacing based as much as I can on fact.&nbsp; I especially have to avoid the thousand-page “cradle to grave” scenario: you know, “In Which I Am Born”, which worked very well for Victorian novelists, but would make today’s New York editors shriek with horror.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">So while Barbara had a fascinating back-story before her birth (her mother was a merchant heiress who, at fifteen, went against her father’s wishes to marry a young lord who’d fought a duel to impress her), followed by a tumultuous childhood (her royalist father was killed in the Civil War and her mother’s fortune was confiscated by Cromwell, while the infant Barbara was put out to live in the country after her mother married her dead husband’s cousin), I decided the most interesting part of Barbara’s story began after she came to London as a teenager.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">But a starry-eyed young heroine arriving in the big city is hardly an original way to begin a book, and besides, Barbara had a bit too much historical baggage to make her first appearance as an innocent ingénue.&nbsp; In just about every other book, both fiction and nonfiction, Barbara is portrayed as a pretty unsavory woman, often an out-and-out villain: beautiful, seductive, and clever, but also greedy, grasping, immoral, and manipulative.&nbsp; I couldn’t reform her, but I could tell her story in a way to explain why she was the way she was.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">I decided to begin with a nineteen-year-old Barbara, at the most important crossroad of her life.&nbsp; (The starry-eyed ingenue now appears elsewhere in the book.)&nbsp; She’s already realized she let herself be pushed into a loveless marriage.&nbsp; Now, at her husband Roger’s insistence, she is about to risk her life to serve the exiled King Charles.&nbsp; I wanted to show how her husband is more concerned about using her to gain favor with the king than for her own welfare.&nbsp; I also hoped to earn some empathy for Barbara and her situation.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, Barbara is no ordinary neglected wife.&nbsp; She's even more ambitious than Roger. I wanted to make it clear that she, too, is thinking of her own future outside of her marriage. Through her thoughts as she leaves her husband, I wanted to set up what would follow next: that she would meet the king and become his lover, and set the course for the rest of her notorious life.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition to establishing the story, I had to establish Barbara’s voice. <em><strong> Royal Harlot</strong></em> is written in first-person, as if Barbara is telling her own story.&nbsp; I couldn't be the omniscient narrator explaining life in seventeenth-century England.&nbsp; Everything had to be explained through Barbara's point of view.&nbsp; From her first words, I wanted <em>how</em> she spoke to be as indicative of her character as <em>what</em> she was saying.&nbsp; That’s why that first paragraph took me so long to get right, and why I kept coming back to it as I wrote the rest of the book.&nbsp; Now you can decide if I succeeded.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff3300;">I’ll be giving away a copy of <em><strong>Royal Harlot</strong></em> to a reader chosen from those who leave a comment or question.&nbsp; Happy new year!</span></p>

<p><em>February, 1660</em></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I was, I think, a gambler born.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t mean a few pennies at whist or ombre, a piddling hand of pasteboard cards.&nbsp; I speak of grander games, where the stakes are power, titles, great fortunes, even the heart of the King of England.&nbsp; Mark you, I’m no coward.&nbsp; I wouldn’t have survived so long if I were.&nbsp; I know how to take my risks, and my vengeance, too, on those who dared to cross me.&nbsp; But how I did parlay my beauty and wit to rise so high: that was the game I chose, the game that became my life.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A gambler, yes.&nbsp; Yet as I sat in the hired carriage not far from the beach and the sea, I was not half so sure of my courage.&nbsp; I was only nineteen then, and I’d never yet strayed from England.&nbsp; The moonless sky was black and wet as pitch, the sea below it clipped with whitecaps.&nbsp; The little sloop that was to take me across to Holland bobbed and tugged at her moorings, her crew scrambling about her narrow deck with their heads bent against the wind and spray as they made their last preparations to sail.&nbsp; It seemed a woeful vessel to trust with my life, as well with as the hopes of so many others.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “There’s the signal, Barbara.”&nbsp; Beside me in the carriage, my husband Roger pointed at the lantern held aloft by a sailor.&nbsp; “You must go to them now.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “I know.”&nbsp; I retied the ribbons of my hood beneath my chin, not because they’d come loose, but to give my anxious fingers some occupation.&nbsp; “Though I wish the sailors could wait until dawn.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Oh, yes, so all the Commonwealth’s navy can be sure to come and bid you a happy farewell.”&nbsp; He sighed with exasperation.&nbsp; “You knew this wouldn’t be a pleasure-boat when you agreed to go, Barbara.&nbsp; It’s too late now for you to change your mind.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “I’ve not changed my mind, Roger,” I said, wishing he’d show a bit of concern for my welfare.&nbsp; “I only hoped the weather were less fierce, that is all.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “It’s better this way.”&nbsp; His pale face was serious in the carriage’s half-light.&nbsp; “I’ve told you before that if you’re caught, no one will come to your rescue, especially if you’ve no time to destroy the letters.&nbsp; You’re far safer on a night such as this.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I nodded, smoothing my hand along the front of my bodice with a flutter of excitement.&nbsp; I was courting danger, no mistake.&nbsp; Hidden between my whalebone stays and my smock were letters of great importance to the Royalist cause, letters of support and promises of money for King Charles in exile.&nbsp; Sewn into my quilted petticoats were gold coins, too, destined for the royal pockets.&nbsp; Not once in my short life had there been a king upon the empty English throne.&nbsp; Cromwell and his sour-faced followers had seen to that with a long and hateful civil war, and hidden away all the country’s natural merriment beneath a grey pall of restrictive laws and false piety.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; But now Cromwell was dead, and the government he’d created was falling in crumbling disarray.&nbsp; There were more and more of us around the country working for the restoration of the monarchy.&nbsp; Roger was thick in the middle of the plotting and planning, and well trusted by the Royalist leaders, which was why, as his wife, I’d been chosen as a courier.&nbsp; Yet the old laws were still in place, and if I were captured and the papers I carried discovered, I’d be damned as a spy, and sent to the Tower until I was tried for treason.&nbsp; If convicted, I’d be executed, for there was little mercy to be found among the Parliamentary judges for Royalists.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “You’re the only one of us who could go, Barbara,” Roger continued.&nbsp; “There’s no one else who could be spared from our work in London.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “You mean there was no one else who was willing to sail to Flanders and risk the smallpox.”&nbsp; I’d had the disease the year before, one of the rare folk to survive, and with my face left clear and unpocked, too.&nbsp; I could travel with impunity into any outbreak, such as the one now ravaging the city of Brussels.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Your immunity is a consideration, of course,” Roger admitted.&nbsp; “But that’s only part of the reason you are being sent, Barbara.&nbsp; I shouldn’t have to remind you of how important His Majesty’s return is to my family’s fortunes.&nbsp; I’ve personally given over a thousand pounds I could ill afford to support the king.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I’d grown vastly tired of hearing of this famous contribution, trotted out whenever Roger wished to puff his own importance.&nbsp; “You wish such praise for your precious thousand pounds, while you think nothing that I’m to risk my life for the same cause.&nbsp; A pretty balance, that.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; His voice turned sharp, the way it often was when he criticized me.&nbsp; “You’ve been quite willing to enjoy the benefits of being Mistress Palmer.&nbsp; It’s high time you returned the favor to my father and me, and prove for once you can be an obedient wife.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I looked away at the spray-dappled glass, refusing to let him open this old quarrel again.&nbsp; We’d so many of them between us for less than a year of marriage, most centered on what he perceived to be my excessive frivolity.&nbsp; Yet I was no better nor worse than the others among our Royalist friends.&nbsp; With so much unhappiness in our war-ravaged pasts and only uncertainty to our futures, we all took our pleasure wherever we found it, and gave no more thought when it was done.&nbsp; Roger had known when we wed that he hadn’t been my first lover, any more than I had been his, and if he continued this harshness with me, I vowed he wouldn’t be my last, either.&nbsp; Was it any wonder that I now lamented the grievous mistake I’d made, letting my mother push me from her house into such a marriage?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As if to prove it, Roger’s lecture was continuing still.&nbsp; “I expect you to present my family’s case to His Majesty, how much we’ve sacrificed by supporting him, and how we hope to be rewarded for our loyalty.&nbsp; Be agreeable to the king, Barbara, and make good use of every minute you have in his company.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “But I will, Roger,” I said, and I meant it far more than my husband, so full of smug conceit, would realize.&nbsp; Even in impoverished exile, Charles Stuart was reputed to be everything a monarch should: tall, virile, intelligent, and charming.&nbsp; How could I not wish to break free of my husband’s overbearing shadow to meet such a man?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Obey me in this, Barbara,” Roger warned, his misguided idea of a farewell between husband and wife.&nbsp; “I’ll hear of it if you don’t.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Perhaps you’ll hear of it sooner if I do.” I opened the carriage door, my cloak whipping around me, driven as if from my own anticipation as by the wind.&nbsp; “Good-bye, Roger. . . .”</p>

 By Susan/Miranda </p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Continuing in our spirit of holiday blogs for the month, I’m offering a copy of my new Christmas anthology, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0373294719/wordwenches0b-20">Christmas Wedding Belles</a>, to a randomly selected reader.&nbsp; Yes, my story in this anthology is a Miranda Jarrett historical romance, but be not frightened, ye historical fiction readers of Susan Holloway Scott: the hero and heroine may be invented, but the secondary lovers in this story are the very real Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson and Lady Emma Hamilton, so post away!&nbsp; A winner will be chosen and announced here later this week.</span></p>

<p>As all we Wenches reminisce about our favorite nostalgic holiday food, I have to offer the all-American Cranberry.&nbsp; Now despite the unending bounty at the local grocery, I’m a firm believer in eating foods in season: strawberries in late May, peaches in August, apples in autumn.&nbsp; And, of course, cranberries for Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>

<p>Cranberries aren’t easy to love, of course, not in the way that other berries are.&nbsp; They’re a gorgeous red,<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=228,height=153,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/12/16/cranberriesspoon.jpg"><img width="130" height="87" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/12/16/cranberriesspoon.jpg" title="Cranberriesspoon" alt="Cranberriesspoon" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 but raw, they’re hard as pebbles and so tart that they require twice their weight in sugar to make them palatable.&nbsp; I’ve always imagined those first settlers in Massachusetts discovering them with delight, only to pucker up with dismay at first bite.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I suspect that it’s my old Yankee blood that makes them so appealing to me (some weird race-memory at work), or perhaps it’s pleasant memories from late-summer vacations on Cape Cod, when the bogs are being flooded for harvest and the red berries are floated to the service like thousands of cheerful, bobbing red marbles.&nbsp; I know we’re supposed to be talking holly-berries in December, but the larger, rosy-pink cranberries look much more festive to me.&nbsp; Heck, I even invented a fictions cranberry-licious location for one of my earlier books, <em><strong>Cranberry Point</strong></em>.</p>

<p>For history-nerds like us Wenches, cranberries carry a wealth of lore.&nbsp; Yes, they were another food introduced by Native Americans (who mixed them with dried venison and pemmican for a long-lasting food to carry with them on hunting trips) to the Pilgrims, which explains their presence next to Thanksgiving turkeys. Likely the 17th century English settlers were already familiar with the close cousins to cranberries native to Britain: marsh berries, bog berries, and (my favorite name) fen whort. </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1200,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/12/16/cranberrieshands.asc"><img width="130" height="195" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/12/16/cranberrieshands.asc" title="Cranberrieshands" alt="Cranberrieshands" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
Soon Massachusetts cranberries were staples not only of Yankee cooking, but of importers, too, sent in sailing ships to the southern colonies and to London, where they were considered a delicacy, much favored for use in sauces, preserves, and pies.&nbsp; They traveled well, and didn’t spoil easily.&nbsp; For that reason, they were also carried among the ships’ stores, a good Vitamin-C-laden preventative against scurvy on long voyages. </p>

<p>With the advent of Christmas trees in 19th century American parlors, the long-lasting qualities and bright colors of cranberries made them a ready choice for decorations as well, strung into garlands.&nbsp; If you’d like to try this yourself, here’s a link to directions for a <a href="http://www.craftmodo.com/category/popcorn/">Cranberry Garland with Popcorn</a>, suitable for an outdoor Christmas tree for wild birds as well the indoor variety.</p>

<p>Now cranberries can be found year-round, in many forms from granola bars to cocktails. But for me, they’re a holiday fruit, and with that in mind, I’m sharing a tasty cookie recipe.&nbsp; The cranberries make them look Christmas-y, so they’ll pass as Christmas cookies at the neighborhood cookies-swap, but they taste better than many of the flashier holiday cookies.&nbsp; And because they include cranberries and oatmeal, you can pretend they’re “health” cookies.&nbsp; Hang the butter and white chocolate: these are actually GOOD for you!</p>

<p>One other recommendation: I took a box of these cookies to my agent’s office last fall, where they were devoured instantly by the staff.&nbsp; Gratifying to know that I’ve done my part to keep literary agents in New York safe from scurvy. </p>

<p><strong>White Chocolate Chip Cranberry Oatmeal Cookies</strong></p>

<p>2/3 cup Unsalted Butter, softened<br />2/3 cup Brown Sugar<br />2&nbsp; Large Eggs<br />1 1/2 cups Old Fashioned Oats<br />1 1/2 cups Flour<br />1 teaspoon Baking Soda<br />1/2 teaspoon Salt<br />1 Bag of Sweetened Dried Cranberries (6 oz.) (aka Craisins)<br />2/3 cup White Chocolate Chips</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Using an electric mixer cream butter and brown sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix well. Combine oats, flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add to butter mixture in several additions, mixing well after each addition. Stir in sweetened dried cranberries, chocolate chips and walnuts.</p>

<p>Drop rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.</p>

<p>Makes approximately 3 1/2 dozen cookies</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I’ll make it easy to win a book, a simple yay or nay for cranberries.&nbsp; Do you like them –– in relish, juice,
 or a shimmering cylinder of jelly, complete with the ribs of the can pressed into the sides –– or do you wish they’d stayed in the bogs?&nbsp; And I’ll also offer you all the happiest of holiday wishes, and the most joyful of book-filled new years!<br />&nbsp; </span></p>

By Susan/Miranda</p>

<p>One of the perennial hot topics for writers of contemporary romance is what to do about “safe sex.”&nbsp; Their characters can’t plead ignorance any longer, not living in the modern world, and for heroes and heroines blithely to hop into bed without any sort of protection against AIDS and other venereal diseases makes them seem irresponsible at best.&nbsp; Yet a love scene that includes the ritual foil packet or questions about having been tested hits the “ick-factor” for many readers. Romances are fantasies, they protest, and fantasies feature great sex over the safe kind.</p>

<p>Historical romance often seems to side-step this question.&nbsp; Certainly in the glory days of Rosemary Rodgers and Kathleen Woodiwiss, characters were so busy getting busy that no one had either time or inclination.&nbsp; But as more and more sex creeps into books, the absence of any mention of protection against pregnancy or disease becomes more noticeable, too.&nbsp; In the Good Old Days (like five years ago), at least the hero and heroine would abstain until it was likely they’d marry, so that any baby resulting from their love-making would be wanted, and legitimate.&nbsp; But now, with the sex scenes often beginning on page one, that’s no longer a given.&nbsp; Add to that the vast worldly experience of most historical heroes, and you do marvel at how seldom pregnancy or the pox is ever mentioned.</p>

<p>I have to admit that in this, I’m no holier than anyone else.&nbsp; I’ve never introduced a condom into a love scene in a historical romance, nor have I had any characters overly concerned about the pox, either.&nbsp; For the most part, my heroes worry about not impregnating the heroines, and my heroines in turn do carefully consider the consequences before they leap, though I do recall one particular unhappy scene that included withdrawal –– the only birth control that many people in the past ever did employ, and a lousy one at that. </p>

<p>Still, condoms?&nbsp; Nope.</p>

<p>But in the historical novel I just finished (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=sr_1_3/104-3951323-1487960?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193507505&amp;sr=1-3">The King’s Favorite: A Novel of Nell Gwyn &amp; King Charles II</a>), I couldn’t avoid the pox and all its tragic consequences.&nbsp; That’s the price of writing about real people, because real people don’t tend to behave as admirably, or at least as obediently, as fictional ones do.&nbsp; Real lives are messy, and when one of my main characters was John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, matters became real messy, real fast, which is what you’d expect of a man who died of a combination of alcoholism and the pox at 33.&nbsp; </p>

<p>All of which leads me to recommend a fascinating small book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Humble-Little-Condom-History/dp/1591025567/ref=sr_1_1/102-3358843-8936954?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1187793049&amp;sr=1-1">The Humble Little Condom: A History</a> by Aine Collier.&nbsp; Though Ms. Collier is a Professor of English at the University of Maryland, this is no dry scholarly text, but a fascinating history, full of illustrations.&nbsp; I don’t know what’s more entertaining: the 20th century posters and advertisements which seem so often to be directed at soldiers, or all the earlier history that I didn’t know. </p>

<p>For example, in the relentless way of disease, Vasco de Gama’s Portuguese sailors were the first to infect the 15th century Japanese, but soon after Dutch traders arrived to do a brisk business in protective sheaths of fine leather.&nbsp; Nor had I any idea that, inspired by Thomas Malthus, early 19th century proponents of population control offered “receipts” for fashioning condoms from animal intestines, procured from the neighborhood butcher.</p>

<p>But is historical precedent enough for the heroes of historical romances to begin waving their be-ribboned<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/11/29/18thcentcondom.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=487,height=188,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="150" height="57" border="0" alt="18thcentcondom" title="18thcentcondom" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/11/29/18thcentcondom.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 sheathes?&nbsp; John Campbell, the Duke of Argyll, did exactly that in 1708, before a packed House of Lords:&nbsp; “This Certaine instrument called a Quondom, occassioned ye debauching of a great number of Ladies of Qualitie, and young gentlewomen.&quot;&nbsp; (There's an example to the right.)<br /> </p>

<p>True, good writer can make anything work.&nbsp; But do readers want that much accuracy?&nbsp; Does such a detail serve to reveal more of a character’s personality and beliefs, or does it fall into the category of “too much information”?</p>

<p>As each of us Wenches have noted here, writing novels set in the past presents its own special challenges.&nbsp; One of the hardest parts is determining exactly how much history you want or need to support your story, and then how much of your “writing time”&nbsp; to invest in research to support that history.&nbsp; Of course this varies from writer to writer, and from book to book, with results that vary from the most mundane “wallpaper history”, set in the indeterminate past where everyone has big houses and wears silk, to more thoughtful books with enough factual background to please a good university press.</p>

<p>I’m a self-proclaimed history nerd.&nbsp; I love history, and I love research, and I’m perfectly happy to wallow in original sources all the day long.&nbsp; This is much of the reason that I’ve shifted my writing from historical romance to historical fiction, where the characters are almost entirely based on historical figures and the plot is driven by fact.&nbsp; For me, that’s more-better-funner writing, about as good as a job can get. But all that lovely research can also become as sticky as the LaBrea Tar Pits, and suck up my time like so many wallowing mastodons.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Which is exactly what happened to me with Bagnigge Wells.</p>

<p>I know this sounds like I’m writing a Nancy Drew mystery (<em>The Secret of the Bagnigge Wells</em>).&nbsp; Actually, my WIP is a historical novel based on the life and times of 17th century actress and royal mistress Nell Gwyn (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kings-Favorite-Novel-Nell-Charles/dp/045122406X/ref=sr_1_3/104-3951323-1487960?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1193507505&amp;sr=1-3"><em><strong>The King’s Favorite: A Novel of Nell Gwyn &amp; King Charles II</strong></em></a>).&nbsp; Most of the book takes place in London, and a well-documented 17th century London at that, thanks to the writings of diarists Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn, and a surprisingly large number of other surviving letters and journals. </p>

<p>There are many writers fortunate enough to be able to travel to the places their books are set, and be<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=258,height=176,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/28/great_fire_of_london.jpe"><img title="Great_fire_of_london" height="102" alt="Great_fire_of_london" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/10/28/great_fire_of_london.jpe" width="150" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" /></a> able to walk literally in the characters’ footsteps.&nbsp; Alas, I’m not one of them; I have two college-age children, and that puts a damper on research junkets to England.&nbsp; And, as I’ve also realized, many of the places I’d want to see no longer exist.&nbsp; Not only did the Great Fire of 1666 destroy much of Nell’s London, but another fire, later in the 17th century, claimed most of Charles’s Whitehall Palace, too.&nbsp; What remained of Restoration London has since been absorbed, knocked down, remodeled, bombed, renewed, and rebuilt by successive generations. I've no choice but to rely on the descriptions of others to create my interpretation of the past.</p>

<p>But back to Bagnigge Wells.&nbsp; In book after book about Nell, there are references made to her “summer house” on the Fleet, a bucolic retreat where she and Charles often went to swim, fish, and generally make mischief away from the court.&nbsp; I liked this, and I worked it into the story as the book evolved.&nbsp; I wrote along with some of those big<strong> ****</strong> in the middle of the scene, astrisks that mean Notes to Self, and are my way of saying, “come back here and put in more when you’ve researched it.”&nbsp; </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=500,height=612,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/28/nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed.jpg"><img title="Nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed" height="122" alt="Nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/10/28/nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> So with my scene more or less written, I went back to fill in the blanks regarding Bagnigge Wells.&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; To begin with, I found no mention of the place in my standard 17th diaries, journals, or references books.&nbsp; I figured it had to be within a day’s journey by water of the palace, but I couldn’t find it anywhere on any map, old or new.&nbsp; In fact, to my chagrin, I realized that the earliest mention of the place in connection with Nell was in a book published in 1878 (<em>Old and New London by</em> Walter Thornbury), which had been repeated as gospel in every successive book about Nell.&nbsp; Here’s the passage, in all its high Victorian splendor:</p>

<p><span style="color: #003366;">“Bagnigge Wells House was originally the summer residence of Nell Gwyn.&nbsp; Here, upon the Fleet and amid green fields, she entertained Charles and his saturnine brother with concerts and merry breakfasts, in the careless Bohemian way in which that noble specimen of divine right delighted.”</span></p>

<p>I probably should have tossed the whole scene then and there.&nbsp; Relying on the word of a historian writing<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=218,height=308,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/28/charles_in_ermine_2.jpg"><img title="Charles_in_ermine_2" height="141" alt="Charles_in_ermine_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/10/28/charles_in_ermine_2.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" /></a> more than two centuries after the fact isn’t generally a good idea.&nbsp; But the summer house on the Fleet was certainly plausible, and entirely probable, and besides, I liked the scene, and I didn’t want to give it up.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; And I just liked the word &quot;Bagnigge&quot;, however it may be pronounced (anyone know for certain?) </p>

<p>And so back I went a-hunting.</p>

<p>What did I learn?&nbsp; That the reason I couldn’t find Bagnigge Wells on any map is that it no longer exists.&nbsp; For that matter, neither does the Fleet.&nbsp; The River Fleet was once one of the major rivers of London, running from its origins on Hampstead Heath, through Kings Cross and Clerkenwell, until it finally emptied into the Thames near Blackfriars.</p>

<p>Bagnigge Wells was located on the Fleet near St. Pancras.&nbsp; The site of two wells known for their healing properties, it may also have been the location of an earlier, abandoned religious order.&nbsp; In Nell’s time, the area was still surrounded by open fields, with only a single public-house (The Pindar of Wakefield) as a landmark, and the river was clear and clean, yet easily traveled back into the heart of London.&nbsp; It was also considered a place with strong royalist tendencies, filled with Charles’s supporters.&nbsp; In other words, the perfect place to escape the 17th century version of the paparazzi.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=499,height=363,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/28/bagniggebreadbutter.jpg"><img title="Bagniggebreadbutter" height="109" alt="Bagniggebreadbutter" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/10/28/bagniggebreadbutter.jpg" width="150" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> But as for those “telling details” that writers so cherish: nothing.&nbsp; Not a peep.&nbsp; Everything dealt with Bagnigge Wells in the 18th century, when the healing wells were developed, and the spot became fashionable with the “middling sort”, who came to take the waters, flirt, and play skittles.&nbsp; (To the left is a genre print of <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">&quot;The </span><em>Bread and Buttery at Bagnigge</em>&quot;) But by the early 19th century, the Wells were described as a ruin, with urban sprawl relentlessly approaching.&nbsp; Only the old Pindar had managed to continue the connection with Nell, with a chimney piece that featured the royal arms and a portrait-bust labeled “Eleanor Gwynne, a favorite of Charles II.) </p>

<p>The once-sparkling Fleet had become little better than an open sewer, and by the end of the 18th century, was completely arched over and built upon.&nbsp; The springs, too, vanished, and all that remains today are two streets in the area: Gwynne Place and Wells Street. (For more information, check out <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/liskmj/living-spring/sourcearchive/fs1/fs1cp1.htm"><em>The River of Wells</em></a>.)</p>

<p>I figure I spent the better part of a morning to learn all of this cool stuff, none of which was really of any use to me.&nbsp; In other words, if I wanted to put Nell and Charles at Bagnigge, I’d have to do so without specifics, and to rely more on my imagination than any hard fact.&nbsp; &nbsp;So this, then, is the sum of how Bagnigge Wells is described:</p>

<p><span style="color: #003366;">&nbsp; &nbsp;“I vow you can’t catch me, sir,” I taunted, raising my head from the river’s surface only enough so my lips would clear it.&nbsp; “Hey, ho, can’t catch me!”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I gulped as big a breath as I could and plunged deep into the water, swimming low so Charles wouldn’t spy me.&nbsp; Finally my lungs were burning and I could keep under no longer, and I popped up with a splatter, gasping.&nbsp; Swiftly I looked about me for Charles, shoving aside my tangled hair that clung to my face and breasts like duckweed.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; All around me was still: the green riverbed, the willows trailing their feathery branches into the water, the few ducks already nesting for the night in the tall grass, their heads tucked demurely beneath their wings.&nbsp; The days were shorter now, making the sky that velvety blue that comes before true dusk, with stars just beginning to spark.&nbsp; The evening mist floated low over the fields beyond the river, softening the horizon.&nbsp; I could hear the first nightingale’s song over the rush of the water, and louder still the racing of my own heart.&nbsp; Our clothes lay where we’d left them on the grass, untidy piles of pale linen, and on top of Charles’s lay two of his piebald spaniels, curled contentedly, I suppose, in his scent.&nbsp; Not far beyond lay the shadowy shape of the house I’d hired for our use for the summer. . . . </span></p>

<p>That’s it.&nbsp; Was a morning of research to prove I’d have no hard facts worth that paragraph?&nbsp; Was this time I could ever justify well spent to my editor (if I ever had to do so, which, fortunately, writers seldom are called to do)?&nbsp; Or was that morning among my research books more a general refilling of my writerly imagination, whether it generated anything immediately useful?&nbsp; Could it just be chalked up to…fun?</p>

<p>Whether this works (or whither the Wells) remains to be seen, at least until next summer, when <em><strong>The King’s Favorite</strong></em> will be released.&nbsp; But here’s a question for now: do you think you can tell when a writer has enjoyed writing a book?&nbsp; Can you sense if the book was a joy, or a trial?&nbsp; Have you ever read books that in some intangible way felt as if the writer had written under pressure (health, family, financial, or simply an idea that had ceased to be magical), or one that felt so right that the words must have flown from the keyboard?</p>

By Susan/Miranda</p>

<p>For all of us who are fascinated by the past (and that’s probably just about everyone reading this blog), history can offer all sorts of surprises.&nbsp; Research can turn up a crucial fact for a plot, or provide the details that bring a character to life, or even inspire an entire book.&nbsp; But sometimes, as a true-born-history-nerd, the best part is stumbling upon Cool Stuff I Didn’t Know.</p>

<p>If a cartoonist were to draw me researching, I’d have a pile of book
s around me, pages bristling with multi-colored Post-Its, a couple of cats, and a big, fat exclamation point of delighted amazement floating over my head.&nbsp; There’s one school of thought that describes history as simply rediscovering everything that’s been forgotten.&nbsp; I like that idea.&nbsp; For me, one of the fun-est parts of the rediscovery process is learning that some thing/experience/invention that I’d always believed to be modern is, in fact, old.&nbsp; Over and over, it seems that our ancestors have already “been there, done that, wrote about it in my diary.”</p>

<p>The ancient Romans can claim first inventing aqueducts, water running through pipes, paved roads, and<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=350,height=247,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/11/royalexchange_2.jpb"><img width="149" height="105" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/10/11/royalexchange_2.jpb" title="Royalexchange_2" alt="Royalexchange_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>

 scores of other engineering accomplishments. Much is made of Thomas Jefferson introducing pasta to 18th century Americans, but it had already been a favorite food in China many centuries before Marco Polo “discovered” it and brought it back to medieval Italy.&nbsp; A large quadrangle building centered by a courtyard, sheltering coffee-shops, taverns, and over a hundred shops selling luxury goods: the description sounds like a modern shopping mall, but it’s actually the Royal Exchange, dedicated by Queen Elizabeth I in 1571.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of course I'm ready to offer examples. *g* Except for the style of the writing and the places mentioned, the excerpt that follows could be a description of modern New Yorkers with summer places on the Jersey shore. Instead it’s from a letter by Daniel Defoe written after visiting Epsom, Surrey, in 1705.&nbsp; He sounds more than a little envious of these “men of business,&quot; too:</p>

<p>“<em>The greatest part of the men may be supposed to be men of business, who are at London … all the day, and thronging to their lodgings at night….They take their horses every morning to London, to the <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=89,height=119,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/11/defoe.jpeg"><img width="120" height="160" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/10/11/defoe.jpeg" title="Defoe" alt="Defoe" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>Exchange, to the Alley, or to the Warehouse, and be at Epsome again at night; and I know one citizen that practised it for several years together, and scarce ever lay anight in London during the whole season…There is a great deal of society, mirth, and good manners, and good company among these, too….but in the winter this is no place for pleasure…good houses shut up, and windows fastened, the furniture taken down, the families removed, the leaves off the trees, and all the people out of the town.”</em></p>

<p>In fact, it’s often when our ancestors grouse that they tend to sound much more like us.&nbsp; The niceties of Whigs vs. Tories are hard to fathom today, but Sarah Churchill’s early 18th century complaint about how little her children learn from travel will sound familiar to modern parents whose offspring spend entire “educational” vacations playing video games.</p>

<p><em>“Wherever the children are, they will be very idle, and notwithstanding all the pains I have taken, they<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=86,height=106,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/11/sarahchurchill.jpeg"><img border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/10/11/sarahchurchill.jpeg" title="Sarahchurchill" alt="Sarahchurchill" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right; width: 123px; height: 151px;" /></a> will never know anything that is of any more consequence than a&nbsp; curious toupee, a laced coat, or a puppet show.”</em>
</p>

<p>Modern editorial writers who devote waaaaaayyy too much ink to the unsuitability of teenagers’ dress would find a kindred spirit in the Reverend Joseph Doddridge, who found much lacking (like the breeches) in the attire of the local boys in 1770s Pennsylvania:</p>

<p><em>“Since the latter years of the Indian war, our young men have become enamored of the Indian dress.,.Their drawers have been laid aside, and the Indian breech clout adopted…With this, when the belt was passed over the hunting shirt (now worn in place of a coat), the upper part of the thighs and part of the hips were naked. The young warrior, instead of being abashed by his nudity, was proud of his Indian-like dress. In some instances I have seen them go into places of public worship in this dress, where their appearance did not add much to the devotions of the young ladies.”</em></p>

<p>Oh, I just best those young ladies had trouble concentrating on their devotions....</p>

<p>But what about you?&nbsp; Have you ever been similarly struck by something from the past that seemed unusually modern? An expression of speech that “felt” like modern slang, but turned out to be 300 years old, or a 19th century Shaker chair that could be in the new Ikea catalogue?</p>

By Susan/Miranda</p>

<p>Like most businesses, publishing is always on the hunt for the Next Big Thing, not only in what goes between the covers, but what’s on the front as well.&nbsp; As Wench Pat noted in her last blog, <a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2007/08/cover-art.html#comments">Cover Art</a> follows fashion like everything else.&nbsp; As soon as one book with an interesting cover becomes a bestseller, every other art director in New York rushes to join the parade. In other words, Good Art is the Art that Sells.<br /> </p>

<p>Now what’s new is old.&nbsp; Old Masters, Fine Art, or just plain Paintings (it’s all in the capitalization, I guess) are gracing popular fiction.&nbsp; This kind of art has long been used on bookcovers, but usually on so-called classic fiction.&nbsp; Old art equaled old writing,<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=148,height=218,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/07/emmabn.jpg"><img width="100" height="147" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/09/07/emmabn.jpg" title="Emmabn" alt="Emmabn" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 apparently, though in many readers’ minds, the sight of any “old” painting on a bookcover immediately brings to mind book reports and reading lists.&nbsp; I really wonder at some of these choices, too.&nbsp; What exactly does the worldly French Comtesse d’Haussonville (painted by Ingres in 1845) have to do with Jane Austen’s heroine <em><strong>Emma</strong></em> of a generation earlier?</p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/07/duchess.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=175,height=267,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="152" border="0" alt="Duchess" title="Duchess" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/09/07/duchess.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>The art on covers now is often cropped in more interesting ways (though don't get me started on the head-less-ness; I'll save that for another blog), and balanced with elaborate type and other design elements to make it seem more &quot;fresh.&quot;&nbsp; Period art helps give a book historical credibility if the characters are based on real people.&nbsp; When I wrote about Sarah Churchill in <em><strong>Duchess</strong></em>, it made sense for my publisher to put her portrait on the cover.&nbsp; Though as I discovered when my publisher was choosing which portrait of Lady Castlemaine to put on the cover of <em><strong>Royal Harlot</strong></em>, it helps if your heroine’s face can pass current standards of attractiveness (For more about this, see my earlier blogs, <a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2007/07/hello-harlot.html#comments">Beauty &amp; the Barbara</a>, and <a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/2006/12/cover_girl.html#comments">Cover Girl</a>.)</p>

<p>Lately paintings are turning up on mass market fiction, too. It's an interesting trend, one that many of the WordWenches readers seem to be embracing.&nbsp; However, for the sake of fair reporting, I have to note that fine art covers on historical romances are, in several cases, proving more confusing than enticing.&nbsp; Readers aren’t “seeing” these covers as romances, and seem to feel a traditional clinch (however overdone) announces a romance much better than a 19th century portrait -- or so the marketing folk are whispering with trepidation.&nbsp; Who knows for certain?<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=119,height=180,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/08/slightestprovbn.gif"><img width="100" height="151" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/09/08/slightestprovbn.gif" title="Slightestprovbn" alt="Slightestprovbn" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
</p>

<p>Personally, I’m all for using art from the era of the story for any historically-based book, whether it's a romance, a western, action/war, or a fictionalized biography.&nbsp; I love art history, and a painting I recognize
 makes me much more likely to pick up a book.&nbsp; Museums and other private collections are paid for the usage of these pictures, too, and I appreciate how those fees help keep such institutions afloat.&nbsp; And, frankly, it’s a lot easier to have a historical romance taken seriously when it has a handsome period cover (like Pam Rosenthal’s <em><strong>The Slightest Provocation</strong></em> here) instead of another luridly sweaty bodybuilder torso.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my Question of the Day: With all the thousands of historical images available around the world and over time, why are publishers using the same paintings over and over?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=240,height=240,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/08/infamousarmyamazon.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/09/08/infamousarmyamazon.jpg" title="Infamousarmyamazon" alt="Infamousarmyamazon" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left; width: 128px; height: 128px;" /></a>

 paces.&nbsp; But I can’t be the only one who’s noticed this, am I?&nbsp; Georgette Heyer’s books are (finally) being reissued in elegant formats worthy of her writing.&nbsp; But in my local big-box store, this new edition of <em><strong>The Infamous Army</strong></em> is on a table twenty feet from <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict</span></span>.&nbsp; Arggh!</p>

That’s only the beginning.&nbsp; Surely with all the beautiful art produced during the Tudor era by artists like Hans Holbein, there must be scads of images to use.&nbsp; Yet both <em><strong>The<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=100,height=151,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/09/08/secretdiarybn.gif"><img width="100" height="151" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/09/08/secretdiarybn.gif" title="Secretdiarybn" alt="Secretdiarybn" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn</strong></em> by Robin Maxwell and A<em><strong> Lady Raised High</strong></em> by Laurien Gardiner have the same painting on their covers&nbsp; Yes, it's a picture of Henry VIII's doomed second queen, but it wasn't done in her lifetime, or even by an English artist.&nbsp; Instead it's a highly romanticized version of Anne's last days in the Tower of London, painted by Frenchman Edouard Cibot in 1835.&nbsp; Go figure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p> Another French artist has had even greater success defining English ladies of the Regency era, at least if current cover-art is to be believed.&nbsp; Gerard's portrait of (the French, not English) Juliette Recamier is luminously beautiful, and one of the most famous portraits of the early 19th century. Art directors all up and down Manhattan must agree, because Juliette's turning up on covers lately with super-model frequency.&nbsp; Here she is, in various forms, gracing the books of Honorary Wench Candace Hern, Mary Balough, and Amanda Elyot.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>
 current historical novelists, has never had a period-painting on a cover on her popular Tudor-set books.&nbsp; Instead her “look” has been over-painted photographs of costumed models, with lavish gold embossing and lush type.&nbsp; Yet the latest edition (the movie tie-in) of <em><strong>The Other Boleyn Girl</strong></em> looks more like one of the <em><strong>Gossip Girls</strong></em> series set in modern New York than the Tudors of sixteenth century England.</p>

<p>What do you think of fine art on book covers?&nbsp; Does it make you pick up a book, or pass on by?&nbsp; And how many other separated-at-birth covers have you seen in the stores?</p>

by Susan/Miranda</p>

<p>I’m newly returned from vacation at the same place where Loretta is now (Cape Cod, Massachusetts.)&nbsp; Like Loretta, my vacation involves much reading, plus a great deal of therapeutic knitting. Also like Loretta, I, too, am by nature the proverbial whiter shade of pale, and can cope with the beach only with copious amounts of sun block.&nbsp; Bronzed goddesses, we are not.</p>

<p>But now that I’m home, I’ve been thrown into a whirlwind of frantic activity that is destroying any shred of lingering vacation tranquility. There’s endless laundry, endless packing, and endless trips to Staples, and Ikea, and the Home Depot, and Barnes &amp; Noble, and every other place with smiling salespeople eager to relieve me of my charge card.&nbsp; In short, it’s time to ship my son back off to college, with the vast quantity of worldly goods that teenagers seem to find essential for survival.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And when the time comes to say good-bye, I’ll cry.&nbsp; </p>

<p>There’s absolutely no good reason for this, of course.&nbsp; Such separations are a necessary part of growing up. My son is happy, healthy, and handsome, and he has finally learned not to talk with his mouth full.&nbsp; His school lies in an idyllic setting snugged in the mountains, deserving of its nickname of “Happy Valley.” He has plenty of friends and a steady, charming girlfriend, two part-time jobs he enjoys, and always makes the Dean’s List.&nbsp; Thanks to the miracle of modern technology, he’ll call home often, and e-mail, too.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(And my more reasonable side reminds me how much perilous things could be.&nbsp; One of my closest friends just packed her youngest son off to West Point, where, as she says, “he has spent the summer playing with guns and grenades –– but under adult supervision, of course.” It's what awaits after graduation that worries her the most, and with good reason, too.)</p><p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=359,height=450,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/23/romeoandjulietposters_2.jpg"><img width="150" height="188" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/08/23/romeoandjulietposters_2.jpg" title="Romeoandjulietposters_2" alt="Romeoandjulietposters_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
Yet still I’ll cry, just as I cried when I first left him at nursery school.&nbsp; In most matters, I’m sturdy and sensible, but there’s something about goodbyes that reduce me to sobbing water-works that would do a hired mourner at a Victorian funeral proud.&nbsp; Goodbyes may mean the beginning of a new chapter in life, but they also signal the ending of another one, and that, I suppose, is the part that gets to me.&nbsp; I cry whenever I see a bride and groom go off in their bedecked honeymoon car.&nbsp; I cry at <strong><em>Romeo and Juliet</em></strong>, and at cheesy telephone commercials. I cry when I drive friends or relatives to the train or airport. Both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Royal-Harlot-Countess-Castlemaine-Charles/dp/0451221346/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-5199528-3381615?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178226602&amp;sr=1-1"><em><strong>Royal Harlot</strong></em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duchess-Churchill-Susan-Holloway-Scott/dp/0451218558/ref=sr_oe_1_1/104-7791204-9807106?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1187919884&amp;sr=1-1"><em><strong>Duchess</strong></em></a> ended with farewells (which I suppose shows that while they had romantic elements, they weren't really romances), and I cried -- sobbed! -- as I wrote the last pages. When I worked at colleges, I’d cry at every graduation and reunion.</p>

<p>I don’t even want to consider how I would have handled the kind of farewells common in the past (and in<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=449,height=500,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/23/lastofengland_3.jpg"><img width="200" height="222" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/08/23/lastofengland_3.jpg" title="Lastofengland_3" alt="Lastofengland_3" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>

 our books) is beyond me.&nbsp; In the time before globe-hopping and instant communication, any farewell could well be final.&nbsp; A woman sending her beloved off to fight in the Crusades, or at Gettysburg, or the Crimea, might not learn his fate for months, or even years, after his departure.&nbsp; Going off to make one’s fortune could be just as hazardous, whether that fortune lay in London, or the California gold mines, or halfway around the world with the East India Company.&nbsp; For every new immigrant eager for the first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty, there were others lamenting what was left behind, as in this famously poignant painting by Ford Maddox Brown, “<em>The Last of England.</em>”</p>

<p>All of which is a roundabout way of saying that this is one more reason why historical romances can prove so satisfying for readers.&nbsp; The French <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=307,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/23/thesailorsfarewell_2.jpg"><img width="180" height="138" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/08/23/thesailorsfarewell_2.jpg" title="Thesailorsfarewell_2" alt="Thesailorsfarewell_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
Lieutenant’s Woman may still be waiting for her lover, but in our books, devotion is always rewarded.&nbsp; Our heroines sleep with tear-stained love-letters beneath their pillows, but there’s never any doubt in our readers’ minds that the heroes will return.&nbsp; No proper romance hero or heroine is faithless.&nbsp; No one changes his or her mind, or gets too lonely and finds someone else.&nbsp; Love will always survive the tests of distance, time, and bad communications.&nbsp; The promise that “they lived happily ever after” carries with it the additional implication that they lived that way together, without any further goodbyes or separations.</p>

<p>If that’s only one more example of what makes a “sappy romance novel,” well then, so be it.&nbsp; Among happy fantasies, surely always coming home must be one of the happiest, and the most satisfying, too.</p>

<p>So where do you stand on farewells?&nbsp; Are you stoic, or a sentimental weeper like me?&nbsp; And do you find a good farewell in a romance serves to heighten the magic of the reunion? Or do you prefer a good-bye on the last page that leaves the future more open for the characters -- as in, say, <em><strong>Gone With the Wind?</strong></em></p>

By Susan/Miranda</p>

<p>Don't know what the weather's like in your neck of the woods, but here in eastern Pennsylvania, we are definitely in the deepest, dirtiest Dog Days of summer.&nbsp; Each afternoon the temperature flirts with triple-digits, the sky's an unchanging swampy grey, and the humidity is more appropriate to the bottom of an aquarium than any human habitat.&nbsp; </p>

<p>By now the fresh white t-shirts bought in April are limp and stained with Popsicle juice, and bathing suits are pilled with those little weird fuzzy things.&nbsp; Cats and dogs lie pressed flat to the bathroom floor, children and spouses are whiny and disagreeable, and the pink cosmos by the front door are nodding thick with Japanese beetles, despite the pricey beetle trap hanging right nearby.&nbsp; Summer reading lists are belatedly rearing their ugly heads, and so (already!) is the nearby Halloween Adventure.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Let's not mince words, Dear Readers.&nbsp; In these parts, August stinks.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, I, like about half of the other Wenches, have Deadlines in early fall. Deadlines that once seemed reasonable and achievable back in the distant time when contracts were signed, deadlines that now loom like the Grim Reaper himself, like the darkest harbingers of editorial despair and futility, like the -- well, enough already. I've only got, oh, roughly a bazillion pages to write between now and the first of October.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Which is why, this week, I'm presenting only a final iconic portrait of Barbara, Countess of Castlemaine. I don't<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/05/simpsonbarb028_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=909,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img border="0" alt="Simpsonbarb028_2" title="Simpsonbarb028_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/08/05/simpsonbarb028_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right; width: 111px; height: 125px;" /></a>
 know if I should be offering apologies to Sir Peter Lely, or Matt Groening, or both (and many thanks to the Cherries over at the <a href="http://www.cherryforums.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=f98bef003efa86ad">Cherry Forum Book Discussion</a> of <a href="http://susanhollowayscott.com/books/harlotpreview.htm"><strong>Royal Harlot</strong> </a>for putting this into my head.)<br /> </p>

<p>Just blame it on August.</p>

<p>So what about you?&nbsp; Are you weary of summer, too?&nbsp; Sick of too much air conditioning and overdone barbecue?&nbsp; Feeling more than a little toasted by heat and humidity?&nbsp; Or do you still have the same fond regard for the season in August that you did on Memorial Day?</p>

				<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/bkarenharper.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=93,height=126,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="135" border="0" alt="Bkarenharper" title="Bkarenharper" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/bkarenharper.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a></em></span><span style="color: #000000;">by Susan/Miranda</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Today I'd like to welcome Karen Harper as a Guest Wench. With frequent appearances on <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>USAToday</em> bestselling list, Karen's name is one many of us will recognize, and she's also a popular speaker&nbsp; with readers and writers groups alike around the country.<br /><br />Karen manages to outdo the Gemini Wenches by writing in not two, but three distinct genres: contemporary romantic suspense (for Mira Books), historical novels (for Crown and Penguin/NAL) and a series of historical mysteries (for St. Martin's).&nbsp; How she manages to juggle both the research and writing for such disparate projects is just one of the questions I asked her in this interview, and I hope you'll have a question or two to ask Karen yourself.&nbsp; She has generously offered to give away copies of her two latest historical novels from Crown, <strong>THE LAST BOLEYN</strong> and <strong>THE FIRST PRINCESS OF WALES</strong> to two readers who leave a comment on her interview -- so please,&nbsp; ask away!</span></p>



<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Susan</em>:&nbsp; You’ve had a wonderfully rich and varied writing career.&nbsp; Yet every writer has that “how I began” story, some particular person or book that first inspired her to write.&nbsp; What is yours?</span></p>

<p><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=316,height=486,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/bfirstprincess.jpg"><img width="100" height="153" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/bfirstprincess.jpg" title="Bfirstprincess" alt="Bfirstprincess" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
<em>Karen:</em></strong> I always loved to read and taught literature for years, but what drew me into professional writing was my love of historical novels when I was growing up.&nbsp; I still have on my “shrine book shelf” the classics that I read and reread:&nbsp; </p>

<p>Anya Seton’s <strong>KATHERINE</strong>&nbsp; (Plantagenet); anything by Jan Westcott, but especially <strong>THE QUEEN’S GRACE</strong> (Tudor); <strong>MY LORD MONLEIGH </strong>(late 1600’s) by Jan Cox Speas.&nbsp; And, of course,<strong>GONE WITH THE WIND</strong>.&nbsp; What also sent me into writing historicals is my love for the British Isles and my many trips there.&nbsp; I went to England in 1980 as an English teacher, but returned as writer.&nbsp; I have been published ever since.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Susan:</em>&nbsp; You’re currently writing three different kinds of books:&nbsp; contemporary romantic suspense, historical novels, and a historical mystery series.&nbsp; Could you tell us a bit about your latest books?&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><br /><br /><em><strong>Karen:</strong></em> In the last few years I have written in three genres.&nbsp; <strong>THE QUEEN ELIZABETH I MYSTERY SERIES</strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=316,height=477,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/bhoodedhawk.jpg"><img width="100" height="150" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/bhoodedhawk.jpg" title="Bhoodedhawk" alt="Bhoodedhawk" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 from St. Martin’s Press, featuring the Virgin Queen herself as the amateur sleuth, is now nine books.&nbsp; I am going to give this series a rest, at least for a while.&nbsp; I wanted to keep Elizabeth quite young in the novels, and after 2700 pages, she’s getting a bit too middle-aged (at least by their standards where 30 was middle-aged!)&nbsp; All of these are in hardcover and paperback.&nbsp; The last book, <strong>THE HOODED HAWKE</strong>, will be out this winter in pb, so for those of you who like to have all books in a series available before reading anything, enjoy.&nbsp; &nbsp; All my books are available through my <a href="http://www.karenharperauthor.com">website,</a> www.karenharperauthor.com. </p>

<p>In <strong>THE HOODED HAWKE</strong> a young, dashing Francis Drake and the queen are drawn together during a royal progress to solve a murder plot which threatens them both—and they are also attracted to each other romantically.&nbsp; Each Elizabeth book features some special aspect of Tudor times:&nbsp; mazes, medicine, music, fashion, Christmas recipes and customs, sports…</p>

<p>I’ll discuss my historical novels below.&nbsp; My contemporary romantic suspense novels are great fun and have put me on the national bestseller lists.&nbsp; The latest are <strong>HURRICANE</strong> and <strong>INFERNO.</strong>&nbsp; They may sound like “disaster thrillers” but they are a blend or thriller/mystery/romance.&nbsp; <strong>BELOW THE SURFACE</strong> will be out in Feb. 2008.&nbsp; These come under the nickname “page turners,” but I strive for that in all my writing.&nbsp; All good writing is suspenseful in one way or the other.&nbsp; These novels are from Mira Books which does a fantastic job of packaging stories and supporting authors.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=312,height=500,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/binferno.jpg"><img width="100" height="160" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/binferno.jpg" title="Binferno" alt="Binferno" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
Susan: </em> Before you began writing full-time, you were a high school literature and writing teacher as well as a college English instructor.&nbsp; How do you think your background has influenced you as a fiction writer?</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Karen:</strong></em> There is no better way to learn something than to teach it. Teaching American and Brit Literature over a seventeen-year period and my own six years of college, during which I majored in English and literature, have greatly impacted my writing.&nbsp; Creating subplots which reflect the main action comes fairly easily; I’ve studied that in Shakespeare.&nbsp; Details—Dickens.&nbsp; Dialogue—Hemingway.&nbsp; Setting a mood—Poe, etc.&nbsp; Teaching essay structure to college prep seniors in high school and college freshmen at The Ohio State University has given me a lot of help too.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Susan:</em> Whether you’re writing a contemporary suspense set in an Amish community or an historical novel in a sixteenth century palace, your books always capture a distinct time and place.&nbsp; Your settings are never mere “window dressing,” but intrinsic parts to the stories.&nbsp; Can you share how you conduct such varied background research?</span></p>

<p><strong><em>Karen</em>:</strong> Settings are very important to me.&nbsp; In my contemporary suspense novels, I actually start by picking a setting (or it picks me), then character and plot evolve from there.&nbsp; In my heavily researched historicals, character and plot, or what really happened historically, drives everything.</p>

<p>I love writing what my agent, Meg Ruley, calls enclave books.&nbsp; That is, I take the reader inside some<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/bthornemaze.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=64,height=100,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="156" border="0" alt="Bthornemaze" title="Bthornemaze" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/bthornemaze.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 sub-group they may not know, so that the story entertains but also educates:&nbsp; my main characters often come from a world we don’t know much about, and that includes Tudor or Medieval England.&nbsp; In my contemporary romantic suspense novels, I’ve used such enclaves or unusual areas as the Amish, the Shakers, the Seminole tribe of SW Florida, the Everglades, midwives, and Appalachia.&nbsp; I love small, isolated, eccentric towns.&nbsp; I try to work settings into my novels as if they were another character.&nbsp; The setting needs to have a “personality” and character arc and to interact with the human characters.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hm, I may have drifted a bit off the question here about how I conduct my research.&nbsp; Let me just say I both do it “the old-fashioned way” by hitting the books (Interlibrary Loan is my best friend) and the new-fangled way—on line.&nbsp; I’ve interviewed through e-mails the archivist of the Undercroft Museum of Westminster Abbey and the Senior Microfiler/Digitiser of the County Hall Record Office in Worchestershire, U.K.</p>

<p>Let me also say that, although the Elizabethans wrote lots of letters, books and records, they gave no thought to standardized spelling, which can drive a researcher crazy.&nbsp; And I often find “facts” which are just the opposite of other “facts.”&nbsp; At that point, the majority rules or I just pick the most likely possibility.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/btydalpool.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=64,height=100,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="156" border="0" alt="Btydalpool" title="Btydalpool" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/btydalpool.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
Susan:</em> One of the topics we’ve often discussed here on the WordWenches is how to balance real history within a fictional framework—in other words, deciding how much history is too little, too much, or just right for the story.&nbsp; How do you establish this balance between fictitious characters and ones based on actual historical figures?</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Karen:</strong></em> Balancing history within a fictional framework is a key concern for anyone writing good historical fiction.&nbsp; Any character I can research, is present authentically; these are often upper class people, but if I can find information on the queen’s coachman (his name was Boonen,) I use that too.&nbsp; Usually, my only fictitious characters in my historicals are servants.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So, in all my historical novels, I use whatever I can research as the foundation, then interpret character and story from that.&nbsp; If I say Queen Elizabeth or Mary Boleyn or the first Princess of Wales or Shakespeare was doing such-and-such at a particular time, that means (1) research shows this was the case or&nbsp; (2) where the character was and what he or she was doing is unknown and so can be logically interpreted in light of what is known.&nbsp; Of course, details and dialogue must be created and suggest the flavor of the era.&nbsp; If I wrote the way they really talked—no readers!</p>

<p>An example of being true to history:&nbsp; Immediately after her coronation, it is recorded that Elizabeth Tudor “took to her bed for a week and was scarce seen.”&nbsp; OK, then I can have her, with her cohorts, solving a crime <em>sub rosa</em> during that week when she was not under observation.&nbsp; However, I would not have her out-and-about in the public eye.</p>

<p>One other aside here:&nbsp; when there is not a lot of research to be found, a writer must really rely on “the telling detail.”&nbsp; I once wrote a novel about Gera Fitzgerald, the “last queen of Ireland,” who lived off and on at the Tudor courts of Mary I and Elizabeth.&nbsp; It was recorded that she was very beautiful and there is an extant portrait of her, but it was hard to find details on her character, even though the Earl of Surrey dedicated love sonnets to her.&nbsp; Finally, I found a briefly stated detail that gave me the core of her bold, outspoken personality:&nbsp; “The lady was sent to the Tower for plainspeaking to the queen.”&nbsp; Ah, the Irish rebel is still in her, however downtrodden her people and family were by the Tudors.&nbsp; She is truthful and courageous—and on from there.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Susan: </em>You’ve written many books set in the Tudor period.&nbsp; What first attracted you to the era?</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Karen:</strong></em> I have written a total of thirteen books set in Tudor England and have one on “the drawing board” now.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think from my answers to the earlier questions, you can see it was a variety of factors that drew me to the Tudor era.&nbsp; Such tumultuous times dominated by amazing personalities!&nbsp; And, as discussed in the next answer, women were really coming into their own.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Susan: </em> Your historical novel, <strong>THE LAST BOLEYN</strong>, followed the life of Anne’s sister Mary.&nbsp; Why do you think<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/blastboleyn.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=316,height=487,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="154" border="0" alt="Blastboleyn" title="Blastboleyn" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/blastboleyn.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
 modern readers are so enthralled with stories of the Boleyn women?</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Karen:</strong></em> <strong>THE LAST BOLEYN</strong> perfectly fits the period and people I’m most interested in.&nbsp; The Boleyn sisters, Mary and Anne, epitomize the growing power of women in this era, which is, of course, totally fulfilled in their niece and daughter Elizabeth.&nbsp; I really resent it when Mary Boleyn is just shifted off as a brief fling Henry had before the feisty Anne caught his eye.&nbsp; Mary grew greatly from being a mere pawn of her father and of two kings, Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, to be a brave, bold woman.&nbsp; She survived the bloody downfall of her family and managed to wed the man she loved and chose.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you have read Philippa Gregory’s<strong> THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL </strong>about Mary, I want to make two points.&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Ms. Gregory and I interpret Mary and the Boleyn family quite differently.&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; I wrote my book 20 years before hers appeared.&nbsp; Random House reissued my novel, <strong>THE LAST BOLEYN</strong>, when historical novels became popular again.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Susan:</em>&nbsp; Like all writers who have maintained long, successful careers, you’ve adapted and evolved with the publishing market as well as with your own interests.&nbsp; What changes have you see in the market, good and bad?</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Karen:</strong></em> It’s thrilling for me to see historical novels come into their own in the current market.&nbsp; When I<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/29/bfatalfashion.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=64,height=100,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="156" border="0" alt="Bfatalfashion" title="Bfatalfashion" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/29/bfatalfashion.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 was first published in the early 1980’s, my historical novels were packaged and sold as historical romances because that was what was popular then.&nbsp; Granted, they have strong love stories in them, but they were about real woman.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, two of my earliest books are back in print from Random House with great new covers and titles.&nbsp; Besides <strong>THE LAST BOLEYN, THE FIRST PRINCESS OF WALES</strong> is available—both were selected as Borders Books featured summer reads, which indicates the popularity of this genre.&nbsp; <strong>PRINCESS</strong> is the story of Joan of Kent, wife of the Plantagenet Black Prince and mother of Richard II.&nbsp; She’s a perfect heroine, because her path to true love and power was anything but smooth.</p>

<p>Also, Penguin/NAL has just purchased a new novel, <strong>MISTRESS SHAKESPEARE</strong>, which will be out in August of ’08.&nbsp; This is not the story of Shakespeare’s wife, Anne Hathaway, but of his “other” wife, Anne Whateley.&nbsp; Research shows that several days before his marriage to Anne H. of Shottery, Will Shakespeare was recorded as betrothed to wed Anne Whateley of Temple Grafton.&nbsp; As you may recall, his union with Anne H. was what we would call a shotgun wedding.</p>

<p>Could it be Will had someone he loved whom he wished to wed, but was forced to wed Anne Hathaway?&nbsp; Or could he have wed his chosen Anne in a private handfast ceremony and then been dragged into church to wed the other, pregnant Anne?&nbsp; Research indicates that two Shottery farmers pledged 40 pounds (a lot of money then) and promised to produce the groom so he would wed Anne H.&nbsp; Research shows that Will lived apart from Anne H. for years, despite her two pregnancies which resulted in three children.&nbsp; Research shows that Will only left Anne H. his “second best bed” and that he bought the beautiful Blackfriars Gatehouse in London and made certain it did not go to Anne H. upon his death.&nbsp; You get the picture.&nbsp; Did Will have another wife, a London wife?&nbsp; The possibility (which I and other researchers believe is a probability) makes an uplifting but heart-wrenching story of Anne Whateley, <strong>MISTRESS SHAKESPEARE</strong>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ah, of such history and human hearts are novels made.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;"><em>Thank you so much for visiting with us, Karen, and&nbsp; I for one cannot WAIT for MISTRESS SHAKESPEARE next summer!<br /><br />Susan/Miranda<br /><br />Karen will be stopping by throughout Monday and Tuesday to respond to questions and comments, so please, don't be shy. We'll announce the winners of Karen's book give-away on Tuesday night.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff3300;"><em>Loretta:</em></span> <span style="color: #ff3300;">Writing in the first person, you’ve created a heroine in ROYAL HARLOT who is far from perfect,<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=462,height=688,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/royalharlotfront_cover.jpg"><img title="Royalharlotfront_cover" height="148" alt="Royalharlotfront_cover" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/royalharlotfront_cover.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" /></a> yet utterly fascinating.&nbsp; How did you develop your sense of who she was?</span></p>

<p><em>Susan:</em> When I wrote about Sarah Churchill for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duchess-Churchill-Susan-Holloway-Scott/dp/0451218558">DUCHESS</a>, I had almost too much first-person information in letters, journals, even an “authorized” autobiography.&nbsp; Sarah kept every letter she received and copies of the ones she wrote; Barbara either didn’t keep anything, or her descendents chose not to preserve what she’d left.&nbsp; (The one exception is the Earl of Chesterfield, who did keep -- and publish -- the letters that Barbara sent to him as a head-over-heels fifteen-year-old; in the way of most teenage love-letters, these manage to be at once achingly innocent and terrifyingly worldly.) </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=190,height=280,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/samuel_pepysw.jpg"><img title="Samuel_pepysw" height="147" alt="Samuel_pepysw" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/samuel_pepysw.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> There’s very little written directly by her, though a great deal recounting her activities in a distinctly tabloid-esque vein.&nbsp; She’s mentioned repeatedly by legendary diarist Samuel Pepys (<em>shown to the left</em>), who, like many other men of the time,&nbsp; was almost obsessed with her beauty, desirability, and yes, even her underwear (there’s a famous passage about how he made a point of walking past her house on wash-day, when her laundress would hang her lavishly lace-trimmed smocks and petticoats out to dry on the branches of her mulberry bushes, and how this was enough to fuel his dreams of her for nights afterward.) </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=378,height=452,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/1st_earl_of_clarendonw.jpg"><img title="1st_earl_of_clarendonw" height="119" alt="1st_earl_of_clarendonw" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/1st_earl_of_clarendonw.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a>But two of the other major contemporary histories of the Restoration were written by men who regarded Barbara as a personal enemy.&nbsp; Edward Hyde, Lord Clarendon (<em>that pompous-looking fellow in the middle left</em>) could rightly attribute his downfall at court to Barbara’s hatred, and he returned the favor in his eight-volume history of Charles’s reign by repeating every&nbsp; vile whisper about her he could find, and others that he likely invented.&nbsp; <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=260,height=367,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/bishop_gilbert_burnetw_2.jpg"><img title="Bishop_gilbert_burnetw_2" height="141" alt="Bishop_gilbert_burnetw_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/bishop_gilbert_burnetw_2.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> In the <em>History of His Own Time</em>, Bishop Gilbert Burnet (<em>the bottom one, on the left</em>) likewise was no fan, viewing Barbara as a vile adultress, a Papist enemy of the Anglican church, and a threat to Charles's protestant soul. Consequentally he paints a very dark portrait of Barbara where no whispered scandal is too evil to repeat, even accusing her of lewd behavior in church as a little girl.&nbsp; Where there’s smoke, there’s generally fire, true, but while these two gentlemen were hardly impartial chroniclers of Barbara’s life, their venomous gossip has so often been repeated that it’s often accepted as historical fact.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For my own fictionalized version of Barbara, I sifted through the gossip to try to find the woman who could inspire such strong feelings.&nbsp; To create her voice, I had to decide which anecdotes and circumstances&nbsp; felt “right”, and what didn’t, and go from there.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff3300;"><em>Loretta:</em> Though we see the world through Barbara’s eyes, King Charles II is, rightfully, at the heart of the story.&nbsp; Some of the scenes involving him were quite poignant.&nbsp; I've always found him hard to pin down.&nbsp; What’s your sense of him as a man and as a king?</span></p>

<p><em><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=172,height=197,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/charles_ii_by_peter_lily.jpg"><img title="Charles_ii_by_peter_lily" height="114" alt="Charles_ii_by_peter_lily" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/charles_ii_by_peter_lily.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> Susan:</em> As a man, Charles has many qualities of any proper romantic hero: he was tall, dark, athletic, and handsome, had a great sense of humor, lots of power, and several nifty palaces.&nbsp; He was kind and considerate of others (not a customary trait in monarchs!), and was known for his exquisite good manners.&nbsp; He preferred women who were as witty as they were beautiful, loved dogs and horses, and in a time when few aristocratic fathers showed much interest in their offspring, he adored his motley family of illegitimate children, making a point of visiting them all at least once a day.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of course, not everything was perfect.&nbsp; He had a horrible relationship with his mother, always a suspicious omen.&nbsp; He was easily bored.&nbsp; He was constantly short of funds, and always having to beg Parliament for money.&nbsp; He didn’t seem to be able to be sexually faithful to any woman, and he was so habitually promiscuous that he almost certainly was poxed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a ruler, he was an idealistic king, determined to learn from his father’s mistakes.&nbsp; He was accessible<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=258,height=176,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/great_fire_of_london.jpe"><img title="Great_fire_of_london" alt="Great_fire_of_london" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/great_fire_of_london.jpe" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px; WIDTH: 133px; HEIGHT: 89px" /></a> to his people on a daily basis in a way no modern leader ever could be.&nbsp; Not only was he approachable in the public parks during his daily walks with his small pack of dogs, but also at worship, at the theatres, and sailing or swimming in the Thames.&nbsp; During the Great Fire, he didn’t flee to the safety of the country like most of his courtiers, but instead joined in fighting the fire himself, even passing buckets of water with the others.&nbsp; He longed to heal his fractured country with a generous optimism that his headstrong people warily resisted. </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=337,height=512,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/abbey.jpg"><img title="Abbey" height="151" alt="Abbey" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/abbey.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> But he was also chronically lazy in matters of state, and possibly ADD.&nbsp; After a conscientious, hard-working start to his reign, he settled into a pattern of unproductive complacency, letting others make most of his political decisions.&nbsp; He disliked conflict, and preferred to take the easiest course rather than the difficult choices of a successful leader. He relied too much on secret financial subsidies from his cousin Louis XIV, and was prone to listening more to his heart than his head.&nbsp; He was most likely a secret Catholic, not a wise choice for the leader of the Anglican Church. His reign is generally characterized as one of great charm, but enormous wasted potential.</p>

<p><em><span style="color: #ff3300;">Loretta:</span></em><span style="color: #ff3300;"> In <strong>Royal Harlot</strong>, the king and Barbara are larger than life yet completely human.&nbsp; Their relationship is the stuff of drama, and yet it has its endearingly domestic side.&nbsp; How did you develop this view of their relationship?&nbsp; What, apart from the obvious sexual attraction, do you think made this relationship last so long?</span></p>

<p><em>Susan:</em> Only the most public encounters between Charles and Barbara are historically documented, and<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1001,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/barbaragoddess007.jpg"><img title="Barbaragoddess007" height="125" alt="Barbaragoddess007" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/barbaragoddess007.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" /></a> nothing of their private, personal relationship.&nbsp; That’s when the researcher has to step aside and let the novelist take over.&nbsp; But it did seem to me that Charles and Barbara were definitely kindred spirits.&nbsp; Both were young when they lost their fathers violently (Barbara’s died of battle wounds during the Civil War, Charles’s more dramatically was beheaded.)&nbsp; Both grew to adulthood with a strong senses of loss and melancholy that never quite left them, and gave something of a desperate edge to all the gaiety and merriment of their later lives.&nbsp; Both were witty, handsome, and widely admired and desired, with all the baggage that so many blessings can bring. (<em>To the right is yet another painting by Lely of Barbara as a goddess.</em>)</p>

<p>Both, too, shared a similar attitude towards sex and passion, and both seemed to require constant variety.&nbsp; They recognized one anothers’ virtues and flaws, and in return accepted them.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=475,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/26/charlottefitzroyslave.jpg"><img title="Charlottefitzroyslave" height="126" alt="Charlottefitzroyslave" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/26/charlottefitzroyslave.jpg" width="100" border="0" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></a> They were also connected by their five children.&nbsp; They fussed and worried over them like any other parents, and long after Barbara had left the English court and moved to France, she and Charles exchanged lengthy letters about this daughter’s marriage prospects or that son’s troubles at school that are touching by being so ordinary. (<em>To the left is one of their daughters, Charlotte Fitzroy, with an African boy who was one of her personal servants; it was the fashion among aristocrats for children to have other children as servants, especially exotic, foreign servants -- a symbol of the growing power of the English empire.</em>)</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff3300;"><em>Loretta:</em> This book gives us a glimpse not only of the characters whose story we followed in <strong>DUCHESS</strong> but of at least one character who's to play a lead role in your next book.&nbsp; Please tell us about what's coming next and when.</span> </p>

<p><em>Susan:</em> My next historical novel will be <strong>The King’s Favorite</strong>, the story of Nell Gwyn.&nbsp; Though Nell’s “job<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=500,height=612,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/25/nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed.jpg"><img title="Nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed" alt="Nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/25/nell_with_blue_cloak_fixed.jpg" border="0" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px; WIDTH: 106px; HEIGHT: 129px" /></a> description” might be the same as Barbara’s (she followed Barbara as Charles II’s mistress), she’s the antithesis of the mighty Lady Castlemaine: a sprightly, diminutive redhead who rose from the streets and brothels of Covent Garden to prominence as a wildly popular actress in the Restoration theatre.&nbsp; Quick-witted and generous to all, she was blessed with the rare ability both to make Charles laugh, and to win his complete trust.&nbsp; If Barbara was the drama-queen at court, then Nell was the comedienne. Yet even after Nell became the king’s mistress and friends with others in the court, she never forgot her roots among the common people. (<em>That's Nell to the right, jaunty in a blue fringed cloak.</em>)<br /><strong><br />The King’s Favorite</strong> will be published next summer by New American Library.&nbsp; Check out the first chapter on my website: <a href="http://www.susanhollowayscott.com/">www.susanhollowayscott.com</a>.</p>

<div><span style="color: #ff3300;"><em>Loretta</em></span><span style="color: #ff0033;">: Royal gossip is as popular today as it has ever been.&nbsp; Royals are still celebrities, after all.&nbsp; But which of them would you rather read about?&nbsp; Today's royals, or those of the past?&nbsp; Can today's Windsor clan hold a candle to the glory-days of the Tudors, the Stuarts, or the Hanovers?&nbsp; Unlike Charles II, the current Prince Charles has had only one mistress, and it has been considered despicable by many of his subjects.&nbsp; (Best not to imagine what modern tabloids would make of the Countess of Castlemaine!) Do you think people today hold those in the public eye to a higher standard than in the past?&nbsp; </span></div>

Interview by Loretta Chase</p>

<div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Susan Holloway Scott’s new 
historical novel, ROYAL HARLOT, A Novel of the Countess of Castlemaine and King 
Charles II, is a love story and then some. &nbsp;The “then some” has mainly to do with the 
Countess of Castlemaine’s extraordinary life and the way she chose to live 
it.&nbsp;What follows is Part I (Part II 
appears Friday) of my picking Susan’s brains about the characters and the world 
she’s so beautifully created...in a book I loved so much that I read it 
twice.&nbsp;Being a history nerd, I’ve 
asked historical nerd kinds of questions--but you can ask your own or make your 
own observations.&nbsp;One of you who 
does so will win his/her own autographed copy of ROYAL 
HARLOT.</p></div>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Loretta:</em> Your July book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Royal-Harlot-Countess-Castlemaine-Charles/dp/0451221346/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-0082113-8978827?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1184976591&amp;sr=1-1">ROYAL HARLOT</a> again takes us to Restoration England, but this time we start a few decades before the setting of your previous historical novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duchess-Churchill-Susan-Holloway-Scott/dp/0451218558">DUCHESS</a>.&nbsp; Once again, you’ve done an incredible job of establishing time and place.&nbsp; To start, I’ll ask you to help set the stage for those of us not very familiar with this era.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Loretta:</em> What and when was the Restoration era? </span><br /><em> Susan:</em> The seventeenth century is one of the most complex and contradictory eras in English history.&nbsp; The Restoration refers to Charles II’s reign (1660-1682) following his ‘restoration’ to the throne after years of exile following the English Civil War.&nbsp; For nearly a decade, England had been ruled by an army general, Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector, and conservative Protestant extremists&nbsp; who attempted to “purify” England of frivolous wickedness by banning everything from choral music and stained glass windo<em><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/20/charles_iiorder_of_the_garter.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=389,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="100" height="154" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/20/charles_iiorder_of_the_garter.jpg" alt="Charles_iiorder_of_the_garter" title="Charles_iiorder_of_the_garter" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a></em>ws in churches to dancing, theatres, bright clothing, and Maypoles.&nbsp; Many of the aristocratic families were ruined during the Civil War, their properties destroyed or confiscated by the new government, with many fathers and sons killed.&nbsp; With Cromwell’s death in 1659, the English people decided they’d had enough, and welcomed Charles II back.&nbsp; With him came the return of a very Merrie Old England.</p>

<p>The Restoration has much in common with other permissive eras that follow a repressive period, such as the Roaring 20s and the Swinging 60s.&nbsp; (All it’s missing is a snappy modifying gerund.) Barbara typified an entire generation of aristocratic children with royalist sympathies who had grown to adulthood without the stability of homes, families, or an expected position in society.&nbsp; In the most extreme cases, like Charles himself, they had led impoverished, gypsy-like existences in exile on the Continent.&nbsp; As a result, many who would once again form a &quot;ruling class&quot; with the Restoration were rootless and wild, and often undereducated as well. (<em>To the left is Charles in his coronation robes.</em>)<br /> </p>

<p>Traditional morality went out the window.&nbsp; Charles hoped England would be a country tolerant of all kinds of people and beliefs. There was a great deal of experimentation, not only in sexual behavior, but also in theatre, science, art, and music, even in fashion.&nbsp; &nbsp;But like all such times, the high spirits of the Restoration couldn’t last: by Charles’s death, society was exhausted by so much freedom, and the pendulum swung back to a more conservative era under the sterner, more restrictive reigns of James II, William and Mary, and Anne.&nbsp; It’s a fascinating time, looking forward to the humanist themes of the coming Age of Enlightenment, but still medieval enough for traitors to be hung, drawn, and quartered, their severed heads finally stuck on pikes on London Bridge as cheery warnings.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Loretta</em>: The court of King Charles II is not only a completely different world from the present-day royal court but from the courts with which a great many of us are somewhat familiar, those of the Georgian and Regency eras.&nbsp; Would you tell us what that court was like?</span></p>

<p><em>Susan</em>: Courts take on the character of their kings and queens, and Charles’s court was no different. <a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/21/200pxcatherine_of_braganza.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=200,height=233,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img border="0" alt="200pxcatherine_of_braganza" title="200pxcatherine_of_braganza" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/21/200pxcatherine_of_braganza.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right; width: 108px; height: 125px;" /></a>
 Like him, it craved amusement and gratification, and distinctly lacked formality. He liked witty people, and surrounded himself with gentlemen who made him laugh and beautiful women of every class.&nbsp; There are numerous stories of visiting ambassadors attempting to conduct diplomatic meetings which are interrupted by the appearance of some laughing, half-naked woman, much to Charles’s delight and the ambassador’s shocked disapproval.&nbsp; But while Charles had great affection for his barren queen, she was marginalized in the court, and his mistresses sat brazenly at Charles’s side.&nbsp; His courtiers followed his lead, and the social atmosphere was bawdy and promiscuous, and given to all manner of excess.&nbsp; (<em>That's Catherine of Braganza, Charles's Queen, to the right.</em>)</p>

<p>Yet it was also a place where intellectual adventure was encouraged.&nbsp; Charles’s time in exile on the Continent had widened his interests beyond those of most English monarchs.&nbsp; He dabbled in scientific<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=184,height=167,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/21/charles_w_pineapple.jpeg"><img border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/21/charles_w_pineapple.jpeg" title="Charles_w_pineapple" alt="Charles_w_pineapple" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right; width: 153px; height: 136px;" /></a>
 experiments in his own laboratory in the palace, and supported the kind of “new thinking” by men like Isaac Newton.&nbsp; (<em>To the right is a picture of Charles accepting the first pineapple to be grown in England –– a considerable horticultural feat at the time –– from the kneeling royal gardener who'd nursed the tropical plant along in a greenhouse.</em>) After the Puritan drought, art and music were flourishing.&nbsp; Charles sponsored one of London’s major theatre companies himself, encouraging new plays and playwrights for the city’s playhouses as well as court masques and entertainments with the same enthusiasm as his ancestor Queen Elizabeth I.&nbsp; Clearly there was seldom a dull moment at Whitehall Palace.</p>

<p>There were momentous events outside the palace, too.&nbsp; Charles’s reign saw the last major outbreak of the bubonic plague in England, a devastating epidemic that killed thousands of his subjects, followed soon after by the Great Fire, which destroyed much of London.&nbsp; Over the same time, there were also several wars with the Dutch, which, though fought largely at sea and not on English lands, were costly both in money and life.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Loretta</em>: The Royal Harlot is Barbara Villiers, the Countess of Castlemaine, who seems to have been the queen of King Charles II’s many mistresses.&nbsp; What made you choose this particular woman for your second historical novel?</span></p>

<p><em><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/20/bv_shepherdess.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=300,height=275,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/20/bv_shepherdess.jpg" alt="Bv_shepherdess" title="Bv_shepherdess" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left; width: 144px; height: 131px;" /></a> Susan</em>: In every fiction and nonfiction book I’d read about the Restoration, Barbara is always painted as the blackest villain: ruthless, greedy, shrewish, and manipulative.&nbsp; Yet she was Charles’s favorite and friend for many years, and he showed her and their children lasting affection until his death. I guessed there had to be more to her than the convenient monster, and that it would be a fascinating challenge to tell her side of the story. (<em>That's Barbara over there to the left in a portrait by Joseph Wright; she's dressed as a shepherdess, complete with a shepherd's crook and a fortune in pearls and sapphires from the King on her gown.)</em></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Loretta</em>: History has not looked kindly on Lady Castlemaine.&nbsp; Do you think today’s readers are likely to find her more sympathetic or do you think she’ll always be controversial?</span></p>

<p><em><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/20/barbaravilliersgasgay.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=482,height=599,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/07/20/barbaravilliersgasgay.jpg" alt="Barbaravilliersgasgay" title="Barbaravilliersgasgay" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left; width: 127px; height: 158px;" /></a> Susan</em>: For the last three hundred years or so, the overwhelming majority of historians and chroniclers to address Barbara have been male. Barbara was a beautiful, high-born woman. She was also intelligent, shameless, and direct in her desires –– the infamous “woman of appetites,”&nbsp; Such women are worrisome to a great many men; they’re unpredictable, challenging, and they don’t do what they’re told.&nbsp; They make men nervous. </p>

<p>They’re also easy to denigrate: where a man is ambitious, a woman is avaricious.&nbsp; A man is a shrewd politician, a woman is only a shrew, conniving and manipulative.&nbsp; A man is forthright, a woman is shrill.&nbsp; A man is a libertine, a rake, a player, but a woman’s a harlot, a slut, a ho.&nbsp; Some things don’t seem to change, do they?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, I’d like to think modern readers will be a bit more sympathetic to Barbara.&nbsp; One doesn’t have to approve her immorality to find it fascinating reading.&nbsp; As (female) historian Lady Antonia Fraser notes, “Barbara must have been tremendous fun.” <em>(The portrait of Barbara up to the left is by the French painter, Henri Gascar, who
had a tendency to make all his sitters look French –– which was likely
why he was the favorite artist of Louise de Kerouelle, Duchess of
Portsmouth, and another of Charles's mistresses.&nbsp; It was also reason
enough for Barbara, always acutely conscious of any slights or
disregard, not to sit for him again.)</em> </p>

Loretta:&nbsp; What do you think, readers?&nbsp; Bad girls -- fun or not fun to read about?&nbsp; Do you think modern readers are more sympathetic to women like Lady Castlemaine than her contemporaries who called her the &quot;Great Imperial Whore&quot;?&nbsp; Do you believe that there's still a double standard in fiction (and in life as well) –– that heroes can be men of vast sexual experience, while heroines are expected to be either virgins or widows, or at least true to one man?<br /> </p>

<p>What about BEING a bad girl? How do you think you'd behave if you were in Barbara's place, riding in that carriage with the king through the gates of Whitehall Palace?&nbsp; Would you be as bold and daring, or not?</p>

By Susan/Miranda </p>

<p>While this week does seem to be the endless Independence Day weekend (you know, the Second-Third-Fourth-Fifth-and-Sixth of July: <em>that</em> holiday), it also marks the release of my second historical novel,<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Royal-Harlot-Countess-Castlemaine-Charles/dp/0451221346/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7454422-0745743?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182207518&amp;sr=8-1">Royal Harlot</a>.&nbsp; </em> <em><strong>Royal Harlot</strong></em> follows the life and career of Barbara Villiers Palmer, Countess of Castlemaine, Duchess of Cleveland (1641-1709), and the most famous/infamous mistress of English <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England">King Charles II</a> (1630-85.)&nbsp; In a way, it’s appropriate to mention Barbara and independence together, for Barbara is certainly one of the most independent women in history.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Born to a noble family, she took her first lover at 15, married at 18, and became Charles’s lover the following year.&nbsp; Following his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Restoration">Restoration</a> to the throne, she was the unofficial queen of his bawdy, fun-loving court for nearly a decade, amassing enormous power and wealth along the way. She was feared for her political influence, acclaimed for her beauty, audacity, and wit, and damned from pulpits for her legendary amorality. Despite her long attachment to Charles, neither of them could stay faithful to the other, and<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=140,height=190,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/29/crop_charles_w_orb.jpg"><img width="100" height="135" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/29/crop_charles_w_orb.jpg" title="Crop_charles_w_orb" alt="Crop_charles_w_orb" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 like him, Barbara had scores of lovers, from rope-dancers to actors to high-born lords.&nbsp; She was a lousy wife, but an excellent friend and mother, devoted to her six illegitimate children (all of whom survived to adulthood, a rare achievement indeed.) After their own fashion, I think Charles did love her dearly, and she him: their version of a love story, a friendship, an alliance.&nbsp; They really were two of a kind.&nbsp; But Barbara did what she pleased, with whomever pleased her, and she didn’t give a fig for what anyone else thought.</p>

<p>To judge from contemporary diaries, it seems that at least half the men in 17th century London were fantasizing about her at any given time.&nbsp; And from the way she and Charles took over my writing-life for nearly a year, I’d have to say her power to fascinate is still strong after three hundred years.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=182,height=225,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/30/barbfaithorne.jpg"><img width="100" height="123" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/30/barbfaithorne.jpg" title="Barbfaithorne" alt="Barbfaithorne" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> As delighted as Barbara would be today to see her story in so many bookstores, I’m sure she would be horrified by her cropped, faceless portrait on the cover. I’ve mentioned here before that while my publisher wanted to use a real portrait of her, they felt that her much-vaunted beauty wouldn’t hold much appeal to modern readers.&nbsp; Tastes change.&nbsp; What was hot in 1660 ain’t necessarily so now, and today Barbara’s much-praised “languid eyes” look more drugged than seductive.</p>

<p>Yet Barbara understood the power of image in a thoroughly modern way.&nbsp; She knew her power lay in her extraordinary beauty, and she knew, too, that the more people who could see her and therefore appreciate that beauty, the more power in turn she’d have as a public figure.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Early in her relationship with Charles, she sat for artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lely">Sir Peter Lely</a>.&nbsp; He adored her beauty, and painted<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/30/barbarawhite_dress004_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1165,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img border="0" alt="Barbarawhite_dress004_2" title="Barbarawhite_dress004_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/30/barbarawhite_dress004_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right; width: 171px; height: 248px;" /></a>
 her repeatedly, becoming so bewitched by her that other sitters complained he’d given them Barbara’s eyes.&nbsp; In addition to seeing his portraits of Barbara hung in Palace, Sir Peter also commissioned and sold inexpensive prints of the portraits.&nbsp; Soon Barbara’s face became as ubiquitous as Paris Hilton’s is to us, with prints hanging in taverns and barracks all over England, as well as in the parlors of people who wished to be fashionable.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But Barbara’s portraits weren’t simply pretty pictures.&nbsp; Seventeenth-century portraits often showed their
 sitters in allegorical poses, as goddesses or Biblical figures, and Barbara, knowing how Charles delighted in clever jests, took care to have Sir Peter pack her portraits with all sorts of hidden meanings.&nbsp; For her first major portrait in 1661, she posed as the repentant prostitute and saint Mary Magdalene, in the wilderness with her long hair unbound (and a revealing, silver silk-satin dressing gown clasped with jewel brooches, but what else does one wear, really, for repenting in the wilderness?)&nbsp; </p>

<p>Barbara, of course, was neither saintly nor penitent, which her contemporaries would have understood at once.&nbsp; Yet they also would have understood the other, more subtle, implications of the painting –– that if Barbara were the Magdalene, then Charles, as the leader of the English Protestant Church, could also be likened to Jesus Christ –– that seem unsettlingly irreligious today.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/30/barbmadonna_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=189,height=225,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img border="0" alt="Barbmadonna_2" title="Barbmadonna_2" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/30/barbmadonna_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left; width: 185px; height: 220px;" /></a>
 But Barbara went further.&nbsp; In 1665, she had Sir Peter paint her without jewels, in the modest blue and red robes of the Virgin Mary. In her arms is the baby Charles Fitzroy, later Duke of Cleveland, her first illegitimate son with the king.&nbsp; She is also visibly pregnant. As lovely a painting as this is, it managed to be simultaneously blasphemous and yet flattering to Charles (who liked it very much), while also presenting Barbara and her son as part of the Stuart royal dynasty.&nbsp; Charles was increasingly sensitive to the fact that his wife had yet to give him a much-needed heir, and he was reassured by this visible proof of his own potent virility.&nbsp; At the same time, the picture was a calculated jab at Charles’s Catholic queen. Catherine of Braganza, showing Barbara as the fertile <em>(very</em> fertile) Protestant Madonna, and a more suitable consort to an English king.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The 1667 portrait on the cover of <em><strong>Royal Harlot</strong></em> is another calculated allegory, designed to make everyone talk.&nbsp; This time Barbara appropriates the queen’s own patron saint, posing as St. Catherine of Alexandria with the saint’s palm-front and the wheel of her martyrdom.&nbsp; Her hand on the suggestive (!!) sword’s hilt represented her readiness to fight for her place at the king’s side, even to the point of<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/30/bettercoverbarb.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=323,height=400,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="247" border="0" alt="Bettercoverbarb" title="Bettercoverbarb" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/30/bettercoverbarb.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> usurping the queen.&nbsp; Wearing decidedly unsaintly jewels (gifts from the king, natch), her voluptuous uncorseted body flaunts her obvious attractions (and the fact that she is again pregnant) in the face of the sallow little queen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Barbara’s sly half-smile has a certain “what, can’t you take a joke?” feel to it that somehow makes the picture even more wicked.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did Charles see the joke, too, or had Barbara finally gone too far?&nbsp; Ah, you’ll have to read <strong><em>Royal Harlot</em></strong>, and find out for yourself…</p>

<p>“Bad Boys” have always been a favorite kind of hero, but “Bad Girl” heroines are relatively few –– especially bad girls like Barbara who are unapologetically bad by choice, not circumstance.&nbsp; Do you have a favorite fictional (or historical) bad girl?&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff3300;">I’ll give away a copy of <strong><em>Royal Harlot</em></strong> on Sunday night to one of the readers who post to this blog.</span><br /><em><br />Most of these paintings of Barbara come from the wonderful book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Painted-Ladies-Women-Court-Charles/dp/1855143216/ref=sr_1_7/102-7454422-0745743?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1183167499&amp;sr=1-7">Painted Ladies: Women at the Court of Charles II</a> by Catherine MacLeod and Julia Marciari Alexander. </em> </p>

<p>Summer’s here, or at least here enough that everyone has the summer-travel-itch.&nbsp; Our characters are no&nbsp; exception.&nbsp; Yes, the majority of historical romances published today take place in London and the counties that surround it, with maybe a junket or two to Bath or Brighton.&nbsp; But English aristocrats have always been intrepid travelers, even in times when journeys were full of hazard and hardship.&nbsp; They traveled for education, for amusement, for love, for health, and for escaping creditors or difficult spouses.&nbsp; They traveled modestly by themselves, with one or two servants or friends, or with huge retinues of footmen, cooks, tutors, relatives, and traveling carriages brought from England.</p>

<p>Writing as Miranda Jarrett, I’m currently in the middle of a three-book series of books loosely titled “<em>Love on the Grand Tour</em>,” following three Georgian ladies on their tour through France and Italy.&nbsp; The second book in the series, <em><strong>Seduction of an English Beauty</strong></em>, will be released 1 July (which my editor reports is a “landmark book”, my twenty-fifth for Harlequin Historicals and a rarity in these days of publisher-musical chairs!) <em><strong>Seduction</strong></em> takes place in late 18th century Rome, a wonderful place to visit in any century.&nbsp; Click <a href="http://www.susanhollowayscott.com/books/seductionpreview.htm">here</a> for a peek at the first chapter.</p>

<p>Researching historical “road books” is a special challenge.&nbsp; Places or experiences that fill contemporary<a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/17/roman_bridge.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=311,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="155" border="0" alt="Roman_bridge" title="Roman_bridge" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/17/roman_bridge.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 travel guides often didn’t exist in 1784, and others that were “can’t miss” destinations to earlier travelers have since vanished.&nbsp; Fortunately, it seemed that every visitor kept a journal or dairy of their trip, noting every meal, inn, famous site, and crooked innkeeper.</p>

<p>Rome was a favorite destination of English travelers. As the second-largest city in Italy (only Naples was larger), Rome had much to recommend it: great beauty, much edifying art and architecture, agreeable, if expensive, inns and houses, operas and theaters, a favorable climate, and hospitable inhabitants.&nbsp; Portraits could be painted by one of the numerous painters in the city, and (often dubious) ancient artifacts&nbsp; procured for the family collection back home. In a time when a good education always included Latin and Greek, the classical ruins of Rome were lessons brought to life.&nbsp; And for Protestant Englishmen –– particularly impressionable young lords –– there was also the mixed lure of Papal Rome, a beautiful siren to be withstood at all costs, and Roman women, reputed to be among the most seductive in Europe.&nbsp; Special treats could be arranged, too: for a sizable fee, some of the famous fountains of Rome could be forced to overflow and flood the surrounding streets, so the English visitors could have their carriages driven through the splashing puddles.&nbsp; Praised one traveler, “Rome is so beautiful that all the rest of Italy seems to me little in comparison.”</p>

<p>Yet just like modern tourists, their 18th century counterparts still found plenty to complain about.&nbsp; English palates at this point weren’t known for their sophistication (as one Continental wag noted, “the art of cooking as practiced by most Englishmen does not extend much beyond roast beef and plum pudding”), and they howled at unfamiliar Roman food.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/17/si214691jpg_maxdim400_resizeyes.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=164,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="82" border="0" alt="Si214691jpg_maxdim400_resizeyes" title="Si214691jpg_maxdim400_resizeyes" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/17/si214691jpg_maxdim400_resizeyes.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
“All over Italy,” whined one English visitor in l7l7, “oil and&nbsp; garlic are put in every dish.”&nbsp; Roman cookery seemed too light, too insubstantial, to most English tastes –– “raw ham, Bologna sausages, figs and melons….and the soup is no better than broth.”&nbsp; Appetites raised by determined sightseeing were doomed to be unsatisfied: “Any Englishman whose stomach is not depraved will soon wish to see a plain, wholesome dish or two of meat <em>a la mode d’Angleterre</em> set before him.”&nbsp; (Not unlike the homesick college students today willing to pay top tourist-dollar for a Big Mac in Paris.)&nbsp; On the other hand, nearly all of the traveling English raved about the wines they discovered in Italy, and longed to be able to transport them for their tables back home. </p>

<p>While most visitors found the Roman people to be charming, “full of good breeding and more obliging than any other part of Italy”, the English in particular were shocked by what they perceived as a general lack of industry.&nbsp; Begging was an art form, and tourists were easy targets.&nbsp; Tobias Smollet complained that, wherever he went, his carriage was “surrounded by a number of <em>servitori di piazza</em>, offering their services with the most disagreeable importunity.&quot;</p>

<p>There’s also a certain smugness to many of the Georgian travelers that unfortunately echoes the<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=202,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/20/romanforum.jpg"><img width="200" height="101" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/06/20/romanforum.jpg" title="Romanforum" alt="Romanforum" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 complaints modern Europeans make about American tourists.&nbsp; &nbsp;“If one thing more than another evinces Italian candor and true good nature,” wrote Hester Lynch Piozzi with unabashed satisfaction in her Observations, “it is their generous willingness to be ever happy in acknowledging foreign excellence.” Ouch!<br /><br />So what does Lady Diana Ferron, the heroine of <strong>Seduction of an English Beauty</strong>, discover on her visit to Rome?&nbsp; She learns to drink the local red wine instead of afternoon tea.&nbsp; She tours the Coliseum, the Forum, and the Catacombs, tosses coins in the<em> Fontana Trevi</em>, and attends the opera at the <em>Teatro delle Dame</em>.&nbsp; Best of all, she finds adventure and loses her heart to a handsome, unsuitable Roman gentleman.&nbsp; Sounds like a great summer vacation to me!<br /><br />Now what about your plans for the summer?&nbsp; Do you like to experience new things, see new sights, try new food?&nbsp; Do your summer trips always involve junkets to museums or historical spots, or would you rather unwind with the familiar, and happily veg out in delicious peace?<br /><br /><em>If you’re interested in reading more, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ladies-Grand-Tour-Enlightenment-Eighteenth-Century/dp/0060185430/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2824038-0536126?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182112020&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Ladies of the Grand Tour</strong></a> by Brian Dolan; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/British-Abroad-Grand-Eighteenth-Century/dp/0750931698/ref=sr_1_1/102-2824038-0536126?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182112117&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>The Grand Tour: The British Abroad in the Eighteenth Century</strong></a> by Jeremy Black, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rome-Biography-City-Christopher-Hibbert/dp/0140070788/ref=sr_1_1/102-2824038-0536126?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1182112244&amp;sr=1-1"><strong>Rome: Biography of a City</strong></a></em> by Christopher Hibbert.&nbsp; The paintings illustrating this blog are by Gaspar van Wittel (1653-1736), whose glorious landscapes of Rome were highly prized by 18th century English tourists, who took them home to add to the private art collections of many a country house.</p>

<p>And there’s at least one Wench (who, me?) who has been known to charge outside in her bathrobe to confront mystified lawn-crews with leaf-blowers about their misguided commitment to blast every last blade of new-mown grass to ear-splitting oblivion.</p>

<p>Modern folk like to think of this general din as one of the banes of contemporary life, another of our special crosses to bear for being so technologically advanced.&nbsp; “Noise pollution”, we call it, a splendidly polysyllabic term for something our more peaceful great-grandparents wouldn’t recognize.</p>

<p>Ah, but we history-geeks know otherwise.&nbsp; The past –– especially the urban past –– was one noisy place.<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=227,height=206,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/30/hogmusician.jpg"><img width="237" height="214" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/05/30/hogmusician.jpg" title="Hogmusician" alt="Hogmusician" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>&nbsp; True, the noises were a very different sort, but the distraction was there just the same.&nbsp; A famous 18th century illustration by William Hogarth called “The Enraged Musician” shows an earlier creative-type, pitifully tormented by the sounds of the London street outside his open window.</p>

<p>I’ve always tried hard to incorporate sound into my writing, one more way to evoke the past.&nbsp; Yet it seems my imagination has fallen far short of reality.&nbsp; I’ve just discovered a splendid new non-history book (oh, be still my history-nerd heart!) called <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hubbub-Filth-Stench-England-1600-1770/dp/0300112149/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-8037241-1997457?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1180551041&amp;sr=1-1">Hubbub</a> : Filth, Noise, &amp; Stench in England, 1600-1770</strong> by Emily Cockayne (Yale University Press, 2007).</p>

<p>This is not history for the faint of heart, or the weak of stomach, either.&nbsp; (All the following examples and quotes come from <strong>Hubbub.)</strong> Stuart &amp; Georgian Londoners would have had to contend with constant traffic noise: metal-bound wheels and shod horses against paving stones, squeaking, creaking wagons and carriages, trumpets to herald arrivals and departures of coaches, and the bellowed oaths of drivers and footmen.&nbsp; Traffic noise was so bad that by the late 18th century, city churches and court houses were being designed without windows on the street levels in an attempt to quiet the spaces within.</p>

<p>Each morning terrified livestock was herded through the streets to market and slaughter, but hundreds of other unneutered animals ran wild through the city: stray dogs, spit dogs, and family pets alike played and barked and fought.&nbsp; Squabbling cats were also everywhere.&nbsp; So were goats and squealing pigs, and even city-dwellers were awakened by roosters before dawn.&nbsp; Early morning was also the time when the dog-skinners (I cannot begin to fathom a market for dog-skins, but then our ancestors were far more unsentimentally resourceful than we) were chasing down yelping strays.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=150,height=195,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/30/strawberryvendor.jpg"><img width="100" height="130" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/05/30/strawberryvendor.jpg" title="Strawberryvendor" alt="Strawberryvendor" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>Peddlers and vendors of every kind shouted their wares, striving to outdo one another.&nbsp; Apparently the pleasing sing-song cries of legend often degenerated into wordless roars.&nbsp; Milk-sellers were particularly known for their shrillness, and the writer Joseph Addison noted one seller who became infamous for her “inarticulate scream.”&nbsp; There were also frequent noisy brawls between vendors over sales turf, fights that were encouraged as free sport by cheering spectators.</p>

<p>Scores of church bells in the city rang for services, deaths, fires, and celebrations, and to tell the time.&nbsp; Street musicians played fiddles, whistles, flutes, and hurdy-gurdys, or simply sang; a loud, piercing voice was highly prized. Puppet shows, jugglers, acrobats, and other street performers added another layer of sound.&nbsp; Trumpets and drums were used to “drum up” an audience, and were also employed by the recruitment officers for the navy and the army outside of taverns.&nbsp; &nbsp;Politicians, charlatans, and itinerant preachers alike made impromptu speeches on street-corners and from balconies and windows.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Land and real estate was valuable, and most houses for rich and poor alike shared common walls.&nbsp; Without the muffle of 21st century curtains, sound-proof tiles, or wall-to-wall carpeting, voices echoed freely in most rooms and into the next.&nbsp; Add to that the open windows (before modern houses became so hermetically sealed for “climate control”), and there wouldn’t have been many secrets left between neighbors.</p>

<p>London was a growing city, and the sounds of construction were everywhere: hammering and sawing carpenters and roofers may not have had high-pitched power-tools, but they still contributed their share of noise.&nbsp; Other trades that involved striking like blacksmiths, masons, tinsmiths, coopers and coppersmiths added the clanging sounds of hammers on metal, while the rumbling grinding of mill-wheels was literally so deafening that the stereotypical miller had lost his hearing entirely.</p>

<p>The “great guns” (cannons) near the Tower of London were fired to celebrate royal births, weddings, victories, and other holidays.&nbsp; Shooting off muskets was a more common “noisemaker” that needed little excuse, and grand displays of fireworks (from the pleasure gardens of Vauxhall and Ranleigh as well as for civic displays) routinely exploded into the night sky over the city. More ominously, the broadsides exchanged at sea between the Dutch and English ships during the Dutch wars of the late 17th century were so loud that they could clearly be heard like distant thunder in London.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Things weren’t much quieter after dark, either. Watchmen with rattles or bells cried the hour throughout<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=255,height=306,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/05/30/5hogarthnight_2.jpg"><img width="179" height="214" border="0" src="http://wordwenches.typepad.com/word_wenches/images/2007/05/30/5hogarthnight_2.jpg" title="5hogarthnight_2" alt="5hogarthnight_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> the night. “I start every hour from my sleep,” complained one visitor, “at the horrid noise of the watchmen bawling the hour through every street, and thundering at every door; a set of useless fellows, who serve no other purpose but that of disturbing the repose of the inhabitants.”&nbsp; Curfews were often created, and seldom enforced.</p>

<p>And in a city full of ale-houses, rumshops, and taverns that were serving customers well past midnight, those celebrants stumbling home in the wee hours contributed to the noise, too.&nbsp; “Great hallowing and whooping in the Fields,” noted one sleep-deprived gentleman, “by such Persons who have spent the Day Abroad, and are now returning home Drunk.”</p>

<p>Relative peace doesn’t seem to have arrived until three or so in the morning, when the “Whores, Bullies, and Thieves have retir’d to their Apartments; noisy drunken Mechanicks are got to their Lodgings; Coachmen, Watermen, and Soldiers are mostly asleep.”&nbsp; But by then, it’s not long until dawn, when the markets and trades come back to exuberant life, and begin the whole day’s cycle all over again.</p>

<p>You know, maybe those leaf blowers aren’t so very bad after all . . . .</p>

<p>So what sounds vex you the most?&nbsp; What modern &quot;convenience&quot; sound would you like to banish from the earth?&nbsp; Or do you simply slip on the headphones to that ultimate machine of convenient sound, the iPod, and blot everything else out?</p>
