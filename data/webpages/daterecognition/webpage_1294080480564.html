<p>
The 
British 
Council, 
which 
first 
began 
its 
services 
in 
Maseru 
in 
1964, 
finally 
closed 
the 
doors 
of 
its 
office 
on 
29 
June 
2001, 
part 
of 
an 
economy 
drive 
which 
had 
resulted 
in 
its 
terminating 
its 
services 
in 
30 
different 
countries 
worldwide. 
The 
British 
Council 
Library 
had 
already 
closed 
on 
30 
March. 
According 
to 
British 
Council 
News 
of 
April 
- 
May 
2001, 
the 
British 
Council 
Library 
will 
also 
close 
in 
Swaziland 
in 
mid-October 
and 
the 
office 
in 
mid-December. 
The 
British 
Council 
will, 
however, 
maintain 
a 
presence 
in 
Botswana.
</p>
<p>
When 
the 
last 
Director 
of 
the 
British 
Council, 
Paul 
Feeney, 
formally 
handed 
over 
the 
keys 
to 
the 
British 
Council 
Building 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Education, 
Mr 
Lesao 
Lehohla, 
the 
stock 
of 
library 
books 
had 
already 
been 
dispersed, 
medical 
books 
to 
the 
Lesotho 
Medical 
Association, 
and 
law 
books 
to 
the 
High 
Court 
Library. 
The 
UNESCO, 
Parliamentary 
and 
National 
Libraries 
also 
benefited. 
The 
video 
and 
film 
collection 
had 
been 
donated 
to 
Alliance 
Fran�aise 
in 
Maseru, 
and 
indeed 
after 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
United 
States 
Information 
Service 
followed 
by 
the 
British 
Council, 
the 
Alliance 
Fran�aise 
is 
the 
sole 
surviving 
foreign 
national 
cultural 
facility 
in 
Maseru.
</p>
<p>
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
acquired 
the 
collection 
of 
educational 
books 
as 
well 
as 
the 
office 
furniture

<a name="Lesotho Fertility Rate Falls">
Lesotho 
Fertility 
Rate 
Falls
</a>
</h1>
<p>
The 
June 
2001 
issue 
of 
the 
Journal 
of 
Southern 
African 
Studies 
was 
devoted 
to 
a 
series 
of 
articles 
on 
fertility 
in 
southern 
Africa. 
�Fertility 
in 
southern 
Africa: 
the 
quiet 
revolution�, 
by 
Deborah 
Potts 
and 
Shula 
Marks 
provided 
statistical 
evidence 
that 
fertility 
rates 
over 
the 
past 
20 
to 
30 
years 
have 
been 
falling 
across 
southern 
Africa 
and 
most 
notably 
in 
Zimbabwe 
(6.7 
in 
1962 
to 
3.8 
in 
1997), 
Botswana 
(6.9 
in 
1965 
to 
4.2 
in 
1996), 
South 
Africa 
(6.3 
amongst 
Africans 
in 
1970 
to 
3.1 
in 
1998) 
and 
Lesotho 
(5.8 
in 
1965 
to 
4.1 
in 
1996). 
The 
fertility 
rate, 
more 
correctly 
called 
�total 
fertility 
rate�, 
is 
the 
average 
number 
of 
children 
a 
woman 
would 
have 
during 
her 
reproductive 
span 
if 
the 
current 
age-specific 
levels 
of 
fertility 
remained 
constant.
</p>
<p>
It 
is 
noted 
that 
even 
in 
the 
1970s, 
Lesotho 
already 
had 
one 
of 
the 
lowest 
fertility 
rates 
in 
the 
region, 
possibly 
as 
a 
result 
of 
mainly 
late 
marriage, 
but 
also 
in 
part 
due 
to 
labour 
migration, 
high 
literacy 
rates 
and 
socio-cultural 
influences 
against 
pre-marital 
sex. 
Although 
the 
causes 
of 
lower 
fertility 
rates 
are 
quite 
vigorously 
disputed, 
�development� 
and 
�modernisation� 
are 
considered 
to 
have 
a 
played 
a 
major 
part. 
Women 
who 
became 
fertile 
in 
the 
1980s 
had 
their 
reproductive 
expectations 
and 
behaviour 
shaped 
by 
education 
and 
a 
better 
survival 
rate 
of 
children, 
thanks 
to 
improved 
health 
services 
which 
reduced 
infant 
mortality 
rates. 
The 
figures 
provided 
in 
the 
article 
predate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
AIDS 
pandemic, 
which 
it 
is 
noted 
is 
depressing 
fertility 
rates 
further.

In 
the 
same 
issue, 
an 
article 
by 
Akim 
J. 
Mturi 
(Department 
of 
Statistics 
&amp; 
Demography, 
National 
University 
of 
Lesotho) 
and 
William 
Moerane 
(Bureau 
of 
Statistics, 
Maseru) 
is 
entitled 
�Premarital 
childbearing 
among 
adolescents 
in 
Lesotho�. 
It 
quotes 
what 
to 
many 
people 
will 
probably 
be 
a 
surprisingly 
low 
figure. 
Just 
3% 
of 
never 
married 
Basotho 
women 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
15 
and 
19 
have 
ever 
given 
birth. 
The 
figure 
comes 
from 
the 
Lesotho 
Safe 
Motherhood 
Initiative 
Survey 
data 
of 
1995 
and 
compares 
with 
a 
corresponding 
figure 
for 
Botswana 
of 
21%. 
However, 
it 
is 
noted 
that 
in 
Lesotho 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
adolescent 
females 
who 
conceive 
before 
marriage 
resort 
to 
abortions, 
which 
are 
illegal 
in 
Lesotho 
and 
often 
carried 
out 
using 
unsafe 
procedures. 
Figures 
are 
quoted 
of 
a 
survey 
amongst 
university 
students 
where 
30% 
of 
61 
interviewed 
admitted 
to 
having 
had 
an 
induced 
abortion, 
a 
figure 
which 
could 
be 
an 
underestimate, 
given 
the 
difficulties 
of 
obtaining 
data 
on 
such 
a 
sensitive 
subject.

<p>
As 
reported 
in 
the 
newspaper, 
Mohahlaula 
of 
27 
June 
2001, 
a 
longstanding 
dispute 
at 
the 
Mission 
of 
St 
John 
Tlali 
(near 
Ha 
Moit�upeli 
in 
Maseru 
District) 
had 
as 
sequel 
a 
court 
case 
before 
the 
Maseru 
magistrate 
beginning 
at 
the 
end 
of 
June. 
Father 
Lefeko 
Seleke 
and 
Tjeka 
Tjeka 
were 
jointly 
accused 
of 
burning 
the 
convent 
at 
the 
mission. 
Part 
of 
the 
convent 
burned 
down 
on 
29 
January 
2001, 
after 
an 
explosion 
apparently 
caused, 
according 
to 
two 
witnesses, 
by 
two 
candles 
left 
beside 
a 
9 
kg 
gas 
cylinder, 
the 
gas 
of 
which 
was 
turned 
on. 
Evidence 
was 
also 
given 
by 
Sister 
Anna 
Leteba 
aged 
60 
who 
reported 
that 
on 
the 
evening 
in 
question 
when 
the 
sisters 
had 
been 
washing 
dishes 
in 
the 
kitchen, 
there 
was 
a 
sound 
like 
a 
thunderclap, 
and 
when 
they 
went 
outside 
they 
found 
the 
fire 
and 
summoned 
help.
</p>
<p>
The 
court 
adjourned 
on 
20 
June, 
and 
resumed 
on 
23 
July 
according 
to 
Mohahlaula 
of 
27 
July 
2001. 
A 
day 
later, 
the 
magistrate 
found 
the 
accused 
not 
guilty, 
there 
being 
insufficient 
evidence 
to 
link 
them 
to 
the 
explosion.<br>

<p>
A

was 
held 
at 
the 
end

June 
at 
Ha 
Thetsane 
for 
a

at 
the

were 
the 
Prime

and 
Ron 
Chu 
Chen, 
Chairman 
of 
Nien 
Hsing. 
The

is 
due

on 
a 
26

one 
of 
the 
last 
reasonably 
large

<p>
In 
a 
speech 
at 
the 
ceremony, 
quoted 
by 
The 
Mirror 
of 
27 
June 
2001, 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
paid 
tribute 
to 
Chen, 
whose 
C 
&amp; 
Y 
Garments 
company 
in 
the 
past 
had 
sent 
15 
unskilled 
Basotho 
women 
to 
Taiwan 
for 
training, 
and 
who 
had 
encouraged 
other 
Taiwanese

As

Opportunities 
Act, 
which 
provides 
preferential 
entry 
for 
goods 
from 
the 
poorest 
African 
countries 
to 
the 
USA. 
Lesotho 
textile 
exports 
are 
already 
extensive, 
having 
averaged 
in 
the 
first 
three 
months 
of 
2001 
�3.9 
million 
m2 
of 
apparel 
per 
month� 
(a 
rather 
curious 
unit 
of 
measurement, 
but 
it 
was 
the 
one 
quoted

As 
reported 
in 
The

of 
27 
June 
2001, 
the 
Commissioner 
of 
Police, 
Jonas 
Malewa, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
Prime

criticized 
his 
own

and 
said 
that 
its 
problems 
could 
only 
be 
solved 
by 
the 
government 
providing 
better 
equipment

facilities. 
In 
particular 
he 
referred 
to 
the 
Police

he 
said 
�is

The

New 
Football 
Stadium 
Planned 
for 
Polo 
Ground
</a>
</h1>
<p>
A 
report 
in 
Mopheme 
of 
3 
July 
revealed 
that 
plans 
are 
advanced 
for 
a 
new 
football 
stadium 
for 
Maseru 
on 
the 
old 
Polo 
Ground. 
However, 
because 
of 
the 
limited 
space, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
relatively 
small 
12000 
seater 
stadium 
and 
bigger 
matches 
would 
have 
to 
be 
played 
at 
the 
larger 
Setsoto 
Stadium. 
The 
new 
complex 
at 
the 
Polo 
Ground 
was 
also 
to 
have 
accommodation 
for 
visiting 
teams, 
a 
tennis 
court, 
gymnasium 
and 
basketball 
and 
volleyball 
facilities 
as 
well 
as 
offices 
for 
the 
Lesotho 
Football 
Association 
(LEFA).
</p>
<p>
The 
new 
complex 
is 
apparently 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
international 
football 
federation, 
FIFA, 
and 
built 
by 
China 
State 
Building 
Construction. 
According 
to 
the 
President 
of 
LEFA, 
FIFA 
would 
pay 
the 
contractors 
directly. 
�We 
will 
not 
touch 
this 
money 
which 
people 
say 
we 
take 
for 
ourselves.� 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
new 
stadium 
is 
apparently 
M6.4 
million.
</p>
<p>
The 
Polo 
Ground 
is 
far 
from 
ideal 
as 
a 
site 
for 
a 
new 
sports 
complex. 
It 
occupies 
a 
limited 
riverside 
site, 
with 
alluvial 
clay 
soil. 
It 
is 
hemmed 
in 
by 
houses 
and 
by 
the 
Maseru 
By-Pass 
and 
is 
far 
from 
where 
most 
people 
in 
Maseru 
live. 
In 
recent 
years 
the 
Polo 
Ground 
has 
proved 
to 
be 
a 
useful 
place 
where 
new 
drivers 
have 
been 
able 
to 
learn 
to 
drive 
away 
from 
the 
increasingly 
crowded 
roads. 
On 
one 
edge 
of 
the 
field 
is 
a 
rock 
slab 
with 
the 
footprints 
of 
Dijaquesopus 
obliquus, 
a 
reptile 
which 
had 
the 
characteristics 
of 
a 
primitive 
crocodile 
or 
turtle. 
The 
slab 
is 
unique. 
It 
is 
the 
only 
known 
record 
of 
this 
animal 
which 
lived 
190 
million 
years 
ago. 
Moreover 
the 
species 
is 
monogeneric, 
so 
it 
is 
the 
only 
known 
site 
for 
the 
genus 
as 
well.
</p>
<p>
According 
to 
the 
Mopheme 
report, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
sod-turning 
ceremony 
soon, 
attended 
by 
the 
President 
of 
FIFA.
</p>
<p>
Under 
the 
Environment 
Bill 
2001 
at 
present 
before 
Parliament 
it 
will 
be 
a 
legal 
requirement 
that 
an 
Environmental 
Impact 
Assessment 
be 
carried 
out 
before 
any 
major 
project 
is 
undertaken 
in 
Lesotho. 
There 
was 
no 
mention 
in 
the 
report 
that 
this 
had 
been 
done 
for 
this 
particular 
development.<br>

<a name="New Stamp Duties Gazetted">
New 
Stamp 
Duties 
Gazetted
</a>
</h1>
<p>
The 
Stamp 
Duties 
(Amendment) 
Act 
2000 
[sic], 
Act 
No. 
11 
of 
2001, 
came 
into 
force 
on 
publication 
in 
the 
Lesotho 
Government 
Gazette 
of 
4 
July 
2001. 
The 
new 
statute 
specifies 
stamp 
duty 
payable 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
situations 
including 
certificates 
of 
marine 
insurance 
and 
receipts 
for 
Post 
Office 
Savings 
Bank 
forms. 
The 
marine 
insurance 
reflects 
the 
statute�s 
origin 
as 
part 
of 
common 
legislation 
for 
British 
territories, 
and 
ought 
presumably 
to 
have 
been 
dropped, 
while 
the 
reference 
to 
the 
Post 
Office 
Savings 
Bank, 
which 
was 
amalgamated 
with 
Lesotho 
Bank 
over 
20 
years 
ago, 
could 
similarly 
have 
been 
omitted.
</p>
<p>
Not 
only 
the 
wording 
but 
the 
duties 
themselves 
are 
refreshingly 
archaic. 
They 
still 
read 
like 
the 
taxes 
of 
yesteryear. 
An 
example 
is 
the 
revenue 
stamp 
that 
has 
to 
be 
placed 
on 
a 
receipt. 
This 
was 
set 
at 
2 
cents 
in 
1972, 
doubled 
to 
4 
lisente 
(4s) 
on 
14 
April 
1989 
and 
has 
now 
again 
been 
doubled 
to 
8s 
in 
2001 
(8s 
� 
1c 
(US) 
� 
0.7p 
(GB)). 
If 
the 
drafters 
of 
the 
law 
had 
intended 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
inflation, 
the 
2c 
of 
1972 
should 
have 
become 
18s 
in 
1989 
and 
58s 
in 
2001.
</p>
<p>
It 
might 
be 
thought 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
printing 
an 
8s 
revenue 
stamp 
would 
be 
more 
than 
the 
revenue 
it 
would 
generate. 
In 
fact, 
enquiries 
in 
August 
2001 
at 
Finance 
House, 
the 
only 
place 
in 
Maseru 
which 
sells 
revenue 
stamps, 
revealed 
that 
in 
fact 
no 
8s 
stamps 
exist, 
there 
were 
no 
known 
plans 
to 
print 
any, 
and 
that 
the 
lowest 
denomination 
revenue 
stamp 
currently 
on 
sale 
was 
20s.
</p>
<p>
As 
a 
result, 
the 
law 
requiring 
revenue 
stamps 
to 
be 
affixed 
on 
receipts 
is 
apparently 
being 
broken 
by 
100% 
of 
persons 
issuing 
receipts. 
What 
are 
the 
penalties 
for 
such 
lawbreakers? 
It 
is 
clearly 
stated 
in 
�26 
of 
the 
Stamp 
Duties 
Order 
1972 
that 
a 
person 
who 
gives 
a 
receipt 
liable 
to 
duty 
unstamped 
(only 
receipts 
under 
R2.00 
are 
not 
liable) 
incurs 
a 
penalty 
of 
R20, 
and 
moreover 
under 
�32 
of 
the 
Order 
this 
penalty 
is 
a 
debt 
due 
to 
the 
Government 
and 
recoverable 
by 
action 
in 
a 
magistrate�s 
court. 
Some 
devious 
tax 
evaders, 
who 
have 
to 
issue 
a 
receipt 
for 
a 
larger 
amount 
than 
R2, 
may 
think 
that 
they 
can 
escape 
the 
8s 
revenue 
stamp 
requirement 
by 
issuing 
a 
large 
number 
of 
separate 
receipts 
each 
of 
which 
is 
for 
less 
than 
M2.00 
(to 
modernize 
the 
currency). 
However, 
the 
law 
provides 
for 
them 
too, 
and 
there 
is 
also 
a 
fixed 
penalty 
of 
R20 
for 
such 
a 
practice, 
which 
on 
being 
brought 
before 
a 
magistrate 
and 
found 
guilty 
they 
will 
also 
have 
to 
pay.
</p>
<p>
Although 
the 
new 
law 
indicates 
that 
Lesotho 
legislators 
are 
aware 
of 
inflation, 
even 
if 
they 
are 
unable 
to 
quantify 
it 
appropriately, 
at 
least 
those 
who 
plan 
to 
get 
married 
have 
not 
received 
a 
similar 
rude 
shock 
by 
having 
taxes 
suddenly 
doubled. 
The 
revenue 
stamp 
required 
on 
a 
Marriage 
Certificate 
was 
set 
by 
a 
Government 
Proclamation 
of 
6 
November 
1871 
at 
two 
shillings 
and 
sixpence, 
which 
in 
modern 
currency 
is 
25s. 
Quite 
amazingly, 
130 
years 
later 
it 
is 
still 
the 
same! 
(The 
last 
revision 
of 
marriage 
law 
was 
in 
the 
Marriage 
Act 
1974 
and 
this, 
like 
the 
Marriage 
Proclamation 
1911 
which 
it 
replaced, 
retained 
the 
original 
amount 
unchanged.)<br>

<p>
As 
had 
been 
widely 
predicted, 
the 
two 
recently 
sworn-in 
Senators 
were 
in 
turn 
sworn 
in 
as 
Cabinet 
Ministers 
on 
Friday 
6 
July 
2001. 
Kenneth 
Mohlabi 
Tsekoa 
became 
Minister 
of 
Finance 
and 
Development 
Planning, 
while 
Dr 
Pont�o 
�Matumelo 
Sekatle 
(her 
doctorate 
is 
in 
administrative 
studies 
rather 
than 
medicine) 
became 
Minister 
of 
Health 
and 
Social 
Welfare. 
The 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister, 
Kelebone 
Maope, 
was 
moved 
to 
become 
the 
Minister 
of 
Justice 
and 
of 
Constitutional 
Affairs, 
while 
Shakhane 
Mokhehle 
(former 
Minister 
of 
Justice) 
and 
Tefo 
Mabote 
(former 
Minister 
of 
Health) 
both 
lost 
their 
cabinet 
positions.
</p>
<p>
The 
post 
of 
Government 
Secretary, 
left 
vacant 
by 
Kenneth 
Tsekoa, 
had 
now 
been 
filled 
by 
Semano 
Sekatle 
(husband 
of 
the 
new 
Minister 
of 
Health), 
who 
had 
previously 
been 
Principal 
Secretary 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Service.
</p>
<p>
One 
other 
new 
cabinet 
appointment 
was 
Sello 
Clement 
Machakela, 
Member 
of 
Parliament 
for 
Mahlatsa 
in 
Berea 
District. 
He 
became 
Minister 
of 
Labour 
&amp; 
Employment, 
replacing 
the 
unfortunate 
Not�i 
Molopo, 
who 
had 
been 
incapacitated 
for 
many 
months 
following 
a 
severe 
accident 
suffered 
while 
travelling 
in 
his 
official 
vehicle.
</p>
<p>
Newspapers 
made 
much 
of 
the 
reshuffle 
being 
a 
defeat 
for 
the 
Lesiba 
faction 
of 
the 
party 
and 
the 
Mokhehle 
dynasty. 
However, 
Shakhane 
Mokhehle, 
who 
was 
born 
on 
14 
October 
1927, 
is 
now 
73, 
and 
apparently 
not 
in 
good 
health. 
The 
general 
effect 
of 
the 
reshuffle 
can 
therefore 
also 
be 
seen 
to 
be 
the 
replacement 
of 
cabinet 
members 
of 
retirement 
age 
with 
new 
blood.

It

electoral 
law 
states 
that 
when 
a 
seat 
becomes 
vacant 
six 
months 
before 
the 
next 
General 
Election, 
a 
by-election 
is 
required. 
Thus 
by-elections 
would 
apparently 
have 
to 
be 
held.
</p>
<p>
It 
was 
apparent, 
and 
Public 
Eye 
of 
6 
July 
confirmed 
this, 
that 
the 
by-elections 
were 
already 
becoming 
a 
source 
of 
disputes, 
particularly 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
voters� 
rolls 
to 
be 
used. 
Justin 
Metsing 
Lekhanya 
and 
Molapo 
Qhobela 
(respectively 
leaders 
of 
the 
BNP 
and 
one 
faction 
of 
the 
BCP) 
said 
that 
the 
by-elections 
were 
also 
a 
ploy 
to 
delay 
the 
holding 
of 
the 
General 
Election.

Irish 
Consul-General 
Leaves

</a>
</h1>
<p>
The 
Irish 
Consul-General, 
Mr 
Tom 
Wright, 
left 
Lesotho 
for 
Mozambique 
on 
Friday 
20 
July 
2001, 
where 
he 
will 
be 
Irish 
Ambassador 
to 
Mozambique. 
Tom 
Wright 
was 
appointed 
Irish 
Consul-General 
in 
1997, 
coming 
from 
Zimbabwe, 
where 
he 
had 
been 
working 
with 
an 
NGO 
supporting 
rural 
agriculture. 
He 
presided 
over 
Irish 
aid 
in 
Lesotho 
at 
a 
time 
when 
there 
was 
some 
doubt 
about 
its 
continuing, 
and 
was 
credited 
with 
persuading 
the 
Irish 
Prime 
Minister 
that 
Irish 
aid 
should 
continue. 
The 
Irish 
Prime 
Minister 
visited 
Lesotho 
during 
Tom 
Wright�s 
period 
of 
office 
and 
was 
the 
first 
head 
of 
a 
European 
Union 
country 
to 
visit 
Lesotho.
</p>
<p>
Irish 
aid 
in 
the 
year 
2000 
amounted 
to 
M76.4 
million, 
of 
which 
the 
largest 
shares 
went 
to 
health 
(M12.4 
million, 
including 
M2.4 
million 
for 
combatting 
HIV/AIDS), 
�governance� 
(M11.9 
million), 
water 
supplies 
(M11.6 
million), 
education 
(M11.2 
million) 
and 
rural 
access 
(M10 
million). 
A 
major 
earlier 
Irish 
project, 
the 
Centre 
for 
Accounting 
Studies, 
had 
been 
successfully 
and 
sustainably 
handed 
over 
to 
government 
during 
Tom 
Wright�s 
period 
of 
office. 
Another 
achievement 
had 
been 
significant 
localization 
of 
the 
Irish 
aid 
programme, 
so 
that 
there 
were 
now 
more 
local 
employees 
paid 
by 
the 
Irish 
government 
than 
Irish 
citizens.<br>

</h1>
<p>
The 
Mirror 
newspaper 
reported 
in 
its 
issue 
of 
25 
July 
2001 
that 
its 
editor, 
Moeti 
Thelejane, 
was 
being 
sued 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister, 
Pakalitha 
Mosisili 
for 
M250 
000 
damages 
following 
the 
publication 
on 
11 
April 
2001 
of 
a 
letter 
in 
its 
Sesotho 
section, 
Setsomi 
sa 
Litaba 
(�The 
Newshound�). 
The 
letter 
had 
apparently 
been 
written 
by 
a 
supporter 
of 
the 
dissident 
Lesiba 
faction 
of 
the 
ruling 
Lesotho 
Congress 
for 
Democracy, 
and 
had 
described 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
as 
being 
a 
drunkard, 
an 
opportunist, 
a 
law-breaker, 
a 
hypocrite, 
a 
corrupt 
politician, 
and 
an 
untrustworthy 
person 
without 
moral 
fibre. 
These 
allegations 
were 
made 
without 
any 
substantial 
evidence 
and 
had 
led 
to 
the 
civil 
suit 
against 
the 
newspaper.
</p>
<p>
Inaccurate 
reporting 
on 
something 
quite 
different 
was 
the 
complaint 
of 
a 
reader 
in 
the 
1 
August 
issue 
of 
The 
Mirror. 
Moeti 
Thelejane 
had 
written 
in 
the 
6 
June 
issue 
that 
�12 
Setlamo 
activists, 
mostly 
youth, 
have 
between 
1999 
and 
May 
2001 
died 
from 
complications 
derived 
from 
the 
teargas 
used 
to 
disperse 
crowds 
at 
the 
Palace 
gates 
in 
1998, 
and 
the 
death 
toll 
is 
threatening 
to 
rise 
as 
more 
are 
reportedly 
coughing 
their 
way 
to 
the 
grave...�. 
In 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
newspaper, 
Khethang 
Maama 
identified 
himself 
as 
one 
of 
those 
who 
were 
at 
the 
Palace 
gates 
vigil, 
and 
he 
recalled 
the 
intense 
cold 
when 
the 
vigil 
began 
on 
4 
August 
1998. 
However, 
he 
stated 
that 
�anyone 
was 
having 
sex 
with 
anyone, 
no 
matter 
whether 
he 
knew 
her 
or 
not.... 
Is 
it 
not 
logical 
enough 
to 
attribute 
the 
deaths 
to 
AIDS? 
After 
all, 
we 
are 
told 
that 
AIDS 
and 
TB 
are 
bedmates�. 
The 
last 
statement 
was 
apparently 
a 
reference 
to 
Moeti 
Thelejane�s 
statement 
about 
Palace 
gates 
veterans 
coughing 
their 
way 
to 
the 
grave. 
Khethang 
Maama 
also 
wrote 
about 
some 
of 
those 
at 
the 
Palace 
gates 
using 
drugs.<br>

Lesotho

of

In

near 
Roma 
on 
the 
night 
of 
27 
July 
2001, 
a 
group 
of 
unidentified 
men 
opened 
fire 
on 
a 
particular 
household 
and 
ordered 
the 
residents 
to 
stay 
inside. 
They 
then 
set 
fire 
to 
the 
houses 
with 
petrol 
resulting 
in 
two 
persons 
being 
burnt 
to 
death 
and 
a 
4-year 
old 
child 
receiving 
burns 
which 
required 
him 
to 
be 
taken 
to

16 
August 
2001, 
where 
it

where 
all 
that

</h1>
<p>
A 
Catholic 
priest 
attached 
to 
the 
Cathedral 
of 
Our 
Lady 
of 
Victory 
in 
Maseru, 
Father 
Thabo 
Anthony 
Monyau, 
appeared 
with 
six 
other 
Maseru 
residents 
on 
25 
July 
2001 
before 
the 
Maseru 
Magistrate 
on 
a 
charge 
of 
having 
misappropriated 
a 
cheque 
for 
M660 
000 
belonging 
to 
the 
CGM 
clothing 
firm 
at 
Ha 
Thetsane. 
It 
was 
alleged 
that 
the 
cheque 
had 
been 
deposited 
in 
the 
account 
of 
the 
mission 
on 
14 
July, 
and 
large 
sums 
of 
money 
in 
three 
instalments 
together 
exceeding 
M280 
000 
had 
been 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
account 
on 
19 
July. 
The 
accused 
in 
the 
case 
were 
granted 
conditional 
bail 
by 
the 
Maseru 
magistrate.
</p>
<p>
Father 
Monyau 
is 
no 
stranger 
to 
allegations. 
Evidence 
by 
a 
senior 
army 
officer 
Colonel 
Mathealira 
Letsitsi, 
presented 
to 
the 
Leon 
Commission 
(which 
still 
has 
to 
report) 
had 
implicated 
him 
in 
supporting 
soldiers 
to 
topple 
the 
Commander 
of 
the 
Lesotho 
Defence 
Force.
</p>
<p>
However, 
even 
more 
problems 
were 
surfacing 
for 
Father 
Monyau. 
A 
day 
after 
his 
appearance 
in 
court, 
two 
vehicles 
were 
stopped 
at 
a 
police 
roadblock 
at 
Setibing 
between 
Maseru 
and 
the 
Mohale 
Dam. 
The 
vehicles 
were 
carrying 
44 
bags 
of 
cement 
and 
445 
litres 
of 
diesel 
fuel 
believed 
to 
have 
been 
stolen 
from 
the 
Lesotho 
Highlands 
Water 
Project. 
Police 
investigations 
showed 
that 
the 
owners 
of 
the 
vehicles 
were 
priests 
at 
Our 
Lady 
of 
Victories.<br>

<p>
In 
the 
statistical 
section 
of 
the 
report 
Lesotho 
statistics 
state 
that 
for 
the 
period 
1981-1990, 
40 
persons 
were 
killed 
and 
680 
000 
affected; 
while 
for 
the 
period 
1991-2000 
(with 
2000 
omitted 
as 
statistics 
were 
not 
yet 
available) 
no 
people 
were 
killed 
and 
501750 
people 
were 
affected. 
The 
assumption 
must 
be 
that 
these 
reported 
Lesotho 
disaster 
figures 
derive 
from 
droughts, 
or 
perhaps 
also 
for 
the 
earlier 
decade 
from 
serious 
road 
accidents 
(if 
these 
were 
reported). 
For 
the 
decade 
1991-2000, 
Lesotho 
and 
Swaziland 
are 
the 
only 
countries 
reported 
in 
Africa 
with 
no 
people 
reported 
killed 
in 
disasters. 
The 
country 
with 
the 
highest 
number 
of 
reported 
deaths 
in 
the 
same 
period 
is 
Nigeria 
with 
5591 
persons 
killed. 
In 
the 
same 
period 
the 
country 
with 
the 
largest 
total 
number 
of

was 
Ethiopia 
with 
38512493 
persons

presumably 
most 
of 
them 
from

The

newspaper 
Mololi 
of 
the 
ruling 
Lesotho 
Congress 
for 
Democracy 
reappeared 
on 
25 
July 
2001. 
Financial 
difficulties 
had 
apparently 
caused 
its 
non-appearance 
for 
an 
eight 
month 
period 
beginning 
in 
November 
2000. 
Its 
reappearance 
enabled 
it 
shortly 
afterwards 
to 
report 
that 
Mr 
Justice 
Ramodibedi 
had 
dismissed 
the 
High 
Court 
action 
brought 
by 
a 
former 
Secretary-General 
of 
the 
LCD, 
Mabusetsa 
Makharilele 
and 
four 
others 
challenging 
the 
validity 
of 
the

of 
the 
very 
closely 
fought 
election 
for 
the

January. 
In 
these

lost 
his

and 
the

had 
been 
elected 
Treasurer, 
beating 
his 
rival, 
Mpho

702. 
On 
the

<p>
The 
Chief 
Executive 
of 
the 
Lesotho 
Highlands 
Development 
Authority, 
Makase 
Marumo, 
died 
in 
the 
Leribe 
Trauma 
Unit, 
on 
26 
July 
2001. 
He 
had 
been 
ill 
for 
some 
time 
with 
a 
brain 
tumour.
</p>
<p>
Makase 
Marumo 
was 
born 
at 
Mahobong, 
Leribe 
District 
on 
11 
October 
1949 
and 
educated 
at 
Peka 
High 
School 
in 
the 
days 
when 
the 
Headmaster 
was 
T�eliso 
Makhakhe 
and 
Mathematics 
was 
taught 
by 
the 
late 
Selometsi 
Baholo. 
The 
School 
Certificate 
Mathematics 
syllabus 
in 
those 
days 
was 
completed 
in 
Form 
IV, 
leaving 
Form 
V 
to 
be 
devoted 
to 
the 
study 
of 
Additional 
Mathematics, 
which 
all 
students 
were 
expected 
to 
take. 
As 
a 
result 
it 
was 
a 
school 
that 
managed 
frequently 
to 
achieve 
100% 
credits 
in 
Mathematics. 
Marumo 
(along 
with 
several 
others 
who 
distinguished 
themselves 
in 
later 
life) 
was 
a 
Peka 
pupil, 
and 
he 
completed 
his 
studies 
at 
the 
end 
of 
1969, 
shortly 
before 
the 
coup 
and 
State 
of 
Emergency 
which 
resulted 
in 
Peka 
losing 
its 
best 
teachers. 
(The 
loss 
of 
Makhakhe 
and 
Baholo 
initiated 
the 
deterioration 
to 
Peka�s 
present 
dismal 
state 
which 
is 
so 
low 
in 
the 
league 
table 
of 
high 
school 
performance 
that 
in 
some 
years 
it 
achieves 
no 
credits 
at 
all).
</p>
<p>
At 
what 
was 
then 
the 
University 
of 
Botswana, 
Lesotho 
and 
Swaziland 
at 
Roma, 
Marumo 
proved 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
best 
students 
in 
the 
Science 
Faculty, 
often 
scoring 
marks 
of 
90, 
when 
80 
was 
all 
that 
was 
needed 
for 
the 
top 
grade 
of 
A. 
In 
his 
third 
year 
in 
1972, 
he 
transferred 
to 
the 
University 
of 
Southampton 
in 
England 
and 
in 
1975 
obtained 
a 
degree 
in 
Civil 
Engineering, 
following 
which 
he 
proceeded 
to 
the 
University 
of 
Birmingham 
where 
he 
completed 
an 
MSc 
in 
1976, 
specializing 
in 
highway 
engineering 
for 
developing 
countries.
</p>
<p>
On 
his 
return 
to 
Lesotho 
in 
1976, 
Marumo 
was 
employed 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Works, 
and 
rose 
rapidly 
to 
become 
Chief 
Road 
Engineer 
and 
by 
1985 
was 
Acting 
Principal 
Secretary. 
From 
1985 
to 
1996 
worked 
with 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank 
in 
Abidjan, 
C�te 
d�Ivoire, 
during 
which 
time 
he 
travelled 
extensively 
ensuring 
the 
successful 
construction 
of 
roads, 
airports, 
railways 
and 
seaports 
funded 
by 
the 
Bank.
</p>
<p>
As 
is 
well 
known, 
the 
Lesotho 
Highlands 
Development 
Authority 
ran 
into 
serious 
difficulties 
in 
the 
mid-1990s, 
when 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
management 
audit 
it 
had 
first 
to 
suspend, 
then 
dismiss, 
and 
finally 
initiate 
legal 
proceedings 
against 
its 
Chief 
Executive, 
Masupha 
Sole. 
It 
was 
at 
this 
point 
that 
it 
sought 
the 
services 
of 
Makase 
Marumo, 
who 
on 
his 
return 
to 
Lesotho 
in 
1996 
provided 
much 
needed 
leadership 
of 
a 
high 
calibre. 
Sadly, 
however, 
his 
tenure 
of 
the 
leadership 
of 
LHDA 
was 
cut 
short.
</p>
<p>
He 
was 
buried 
in 
Kokobela 
Cemetery 
in 
Maseru 
West 
on 
Saturday 
4 
August 
after 
a 
service 
at 
Machabeng 
High 
School. 
He 
leaves 
a 
wife, 
the 
former 
Helen 
Wright 
whom 
he 
married 
in 
Freetown, 
Sierra 
Leone 
on 
16 
October 
1976. 
He 
is 
also 
survived 
by 
their 
two 
children, 
a 
daughter, 
Tebello, 
and 
a 
son, 
Khotso.<br>

<p>
A

palaeontological 
expedition, 
led 
by 
Dr 
Bernard 
Battail 
of 
the 
Institut 
de 
Pal�ontologie 
in 
Paris 
spent 
three 
weeks 
during 
July 
2001 
at 
Likhoele 
in 
Mafeteng 
District, 
searching 
for 
early 
dinosaurs 
and 
mammal-like 
reptiles 
in 
the 
Elliot 
Formation, 
also 
known 
as 
the 
Red 
Beds. 
These 
friable 
red 
shales 
have 
proved 
a 
happy 
hunting 
ground 
for 
palaeontologists 
in 
Lesotho, 
and 
have 
yielded 
world 
famous 
fossils 
such 
as 
Megazostrodon 
rudnerae 
found 
at 
Pokane 
in 
Quthing 
District 
and 
Erythrotherium 
parringtoni 
found 
at 
Likhoele. 
In 
the 
1960s 
and 
1970s 
these 
gave 
Lesotho 
the 
distinction 
of 
being 
the 
source 
of 
the 
world�s 
earliest 
known 
mammals. 
Other 
fossils 
from 
China 
and 
the 
United 
States, 
however, 
eventually 
resulted 
in 
these 
Lesotho 
fossils 
having 
to 
relinquish 
their 
earliest 
known 
mammal 
status.
</p>
<p>
Bernard 
Battail 
is 
no 
stranger 
to 
Lesotho, 
which 
he 
first 
visited 
in 
1968. 
With 
permits 
from 
the 
Lesotho 
Government 
Protection 
&amp; 
Preservation 
Commission 
he 
has 
excavated 
with 
French 
expeditions 
five 
times, 
leading 
the 
four 
later 
expeditions 
himself. 
Dinosaurs 
including 
Massospondylus 
and 
Euskelosaurus, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
advanced 
cynodont 
still 
being 
prepared 
and 
described, 
have 
been 
recovered 
from 
places 
such 
as 
Ha 
Sekake 
and 
Ha 
Noosi 
in 
Qacha�s 
Nek 
District 
as 
well 
as 
Maphutseng 
in 
Mohale�s 
Hoek 
District 
and 
Thabana-Morena 
in 
Mafeteng 
District. 
The 
2001 
expedition 
found 
a 
number 
of 
interesting 
fossils, 
including 
a 
Tritylodontid, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
family 
named 
after 
Tritylodon 
longaevus, 
a 
fossil 
originally 
found 
in 
1882 
at 
Thaba-T�oeu 
in 
Mafeteng 
District. 
It 
was 
this 
fossil 
which 
originally 
put 
Lesotho 
on 
the 
palaeontological 
map, 
and 
indeed 
for 
more 
than 
half 
a 
century 
Tritylodon 
was 
regarded 
as 
the 
world�s 
earliest 
mammal. 
Even 
though 
it 
was 
later 
demoted 
to 
being 
a 
mere 
mammal-like 
reptile, 
as 
has 
been 
seen, 
Lesotho 
was 
later 
able 
to 
reclaim 
for 
a 
while 
the 
distinction 
of 
being 
the 
source 
of 
the 
world�s 
earliest 
known 
mammals.
</p>
<p>
Lesotho 
fossils 
in 
Paris 
include 
some 
on 
display 
at 
the 
Mus�um 
d�Histoire 
Naturelle. 
However, 
many 
of 
the 
Lesotho 
fossils 
in 
France 
were 
taken 
there 
on 
temporary 
export 
permits 
and 
thus 
remain 
the 
property 
of 
Lesotho. 
They 
could 
one 
day 
be 
returned 
and 
on 
display 
in 
Maseru, 
if

there 
having 
been 
a

Director 
and 
other

for 
over 
25

facilitated 
publication. 
More 
recently 
its 
appearance 
has 
been 
sporadic, 
with 
the 
only 
volumes 
in 
the 
1990s 
until 
recently 
being 
for 
1992 
and 
1994. 
The 
alternate 
year 
sequence 
was 
maintained 
by 
the 
appearance 
in 
July 
2001 
of 
the 
yearbook 
for 
1996, 
in 
which 
the 
introduction 
apologizes 
for 
the 
delay 
and 
says 
that 
work 
on 
the 
1997 
yearbook 
is 
ongoing 
and 
that 
it 
will 
be 
published 
soon. 
There 
is 
also 
an 
apology 
that 
despite 
it 
being 
the 
1996 
yearbook, 
much 
of 
the 
information 
pertains 
to 
1995.
</p>
<p>
Given 
that 
the 
information 
for 
the 
intervening 
five 
years 
must 
have 
already 
been 
collected, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
see 
why 
the 
statistical 
yearbook 
is 
so 
late. 
The 
reason 
which 
is 
given 
is 
that 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Bureau 
were 
kept 
busy 
by 
the 
1996 
census. 
If 
so, 
it 
is 
a 
pity 
that 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
census 
data 
is 
not 
better. 
Undercounting 
which 
could 
not 
be 
reliably 
estimated 
has 
resulted 
in 
a 
1996 
census 
figure 
which 
is 
of 
little 
worth, 
and 
creates 
an 
anomaly 
by 
which 
the 
yearbook 
shows 
a 
steady 
population 
growth 
from 
1991 
to 
1995 
followed 
by 
a 
drop 
from 
2.08 
million 
people 
in 
1995 
to 
a 
�smoothed 
population� 
of 
1.96 
million 
people 
in 
1996.
</p>
<p>
The 
yearbook 
is 
divided 
into 
12 
sections 
which 
provide 
detailed 
statistics 
on 
climate, 
population, 
education, 
health, 
tourism 
and 
migrant 
labour, 
agriculture, 
foreign 
trade, 
national 
accounts, 
transport 
and 
communications, 
money 
and 
banking, 
price 
indices 
and 
prisons. 
One 
of 
the 
largest 
sections 
is 
on 
agriculture 
and 
includes 
surprisingly 
detailed 
data 
in 
some 
areas. 
For 
example 
four 
pages 
of 
statistics 
are 
devoted 
to 
the 
numbers 
of 
donkeys 
recorded 
for 
the 
1994/5 
and 
1995/6 
agricultural 
years 
by 
district 
and 
age 
of 
donkey. 
Numbers 
of 
donkeys 
born, 
purchased, 
died 
from 
disease, 
slaughtered 
or 
died 
from 
other 
causes 
(what 
could 
these 
be?) 
are 
recorded. 
In 
1995/6 
Maseru 
District 
had 
the 
most 
donkeys, 
and 
Qacha�s 
Nek 
District 
the 
least. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Berea 
District 
had 
the 
highest 
donkey 
birth 
rate. 
Like 
the 
human 
statistics 
from 
the 
1996 
census, 
the 
donkey 
statistics 
have 
many 
anomalies. 
In 
1994/5, 
Butha-Buthe 
District 
had 
no 
donkeys 
born 
at 
all, 
while 
Leribe 
District 
next 
door 
had 
700 
donkey 
births. 
Yet 
a 
year 
later 
in 
1995/6, 
there 
were 
520 
donkeys 
in 
Butha-Buthe 
District 
(145 
male 
and 
375 
female) 
under 
the 
age 
of 
one 
year. 
Next 
door 
in 
Leribe 
District 
there 
were 
500 
donkeys 
(375 
male 
and 
125 
female) 
under 
the 
age 
of 
one 
year. 
Quite 
apart 
from 
the 
problem 
of 
where 
the 
donkey 
foals 
in 
Butha-Buthe 
came 
from, 
there 
is 
the 
problem 
of 
the 
strangely 
different 
donkey 
sex-ratios 
in 
neighbouring 
districts. 
Since 
the 
yearbook 
has 
nothing 
about 
donkey 
census 
methodology, 
one 
has 
only 
the 
statistics 
themselves 
as 
evidence, 
and 
these 
can 
only 
arouse 
suspicions 
as 
to 
whether 
some 
of 
the 
statistics 
presented 
were 
ever 
collected 
at 
all.<br>

</h1>
<p>
An 
article 
in 
the 
Central 
Bank 
of 
Lesotho 
Quarterly 
Review 
of 
July 
2001 
noted 
that 
as 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year 
2000, 
Lesotho�s 
total 
public 
debt 
was 
at 
the 
level 
of 
153% 
of 
its 
annual 
export 
earnings. 
It 
considered 
that 
Lesotho�s 
debt 
was 
below 
�the 
internationally 
accepted 
sustainability 
limit 
of 
200%�, 
unlike 
that 
of 
Argentina, 
which 
in 
a 
recent 
article 
in 
the 
19 
July 
2001 
issue 
of 
The 
Economist 
was 
shown 
to 
have 
a 
total 
debt 
over 
420% 
of 
exports, 
leading 
to 
a 
severe 
financial 
crisis. 
The 
CBL 
Quarterly 
Review 
article 
noted 
that 
Lesotho�s 
debt 
has 
a 
favourable 
maturity 
structure 
and 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
grow 
to 
unsustainable 
levels.<br>

Roma 
suffered 
two 
serious 
road 
accidents 
a 
week 
apart 
in 
late 
July 
and 
early 
August. 
About 
9 
p.m. 
on 
Saturday 
28 
July, 
a 
25-seater 
Venture 
bus 
collided 
head-on 
with 
a 
4 
x 
4 
vehicle 
at 
Lengoeleng, 
1 
km 
on 
the 
Roma 
side 
of 
the 
Liphiring 
Bridge. 
The 
bus 
was 
bringing 
passengers 
from 
Maseru 
to 
Roma, 
and 
the 
other 
vehicle 
had 
just 
left 
the 
Speakeasy 
Bar 
in 
Roma. 
At 
least 
5 
persons 
died 
in 
this 
collision, 
including 
Paseka 
Mafa 
who 
was 
a 
staff 
member 
in 
the 
University

and 
had 
recently

<p>
At 
about 
9 
a.m. 
on 
Sunday 
5 
August, 
there 
was 
a 
second 
serious 
accident 
at

when 
a

carrying 
nine 
members 
of 
the 
Mohoebi 
family 
of 
Ha 
Leutsoa 
overturned, 
after 
running 
off 
the

and 
hitting 
a 
cement 
drainage 
structure. 
Three 
members 
died 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
accident,

who 
was 
a 
Zionist 
bishop, 
his 
wife 
�Matebello, 
and 
their 
son-in-law,

They 
had 
been 
attending 
a

<p>
T�olo 
Lelala 
and 
his 
wife 
�Mantsane 
had 
a 
narrow 
escape 
in 
1986, 
when 
soldiers 
came 
to 
their 
house 
and 
abducted 
them 
together 
with 
their 
guests, 
�Manapo 
and 
Desmond 
Sixishe 
and 
Vincent 
Makhele 
and 
his 
wife. 
The 
Sixishes 
and 
Makheles 
were 
murdered 
shortly 
afterwards 
at 
Bushmen�s 
Pass 
(Khalong-la-Baroa), 
murders 
for 
which 
a 
military 
officer 
and 
a 
former 
member 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers, 
Colonel 
Joshua 
Sekhobe 
Letsie 
are 
still 
serving 
long 
sentences. 
The 
Lelalas 
escaped 
in 
the 
darkness 
while 
the 
soldiers 
who 
had 
abducted 
them 
were 
still 
debating 
as 
to 
whether 
they 
should 
also 
be 
killed.
</p>
<p>
Desmond 
Sixishe 
and 
Vincent 
Makhele 
had 
been 
cabinet 
ministers 
in 
the 
Basotho 
National 
Party 
Government 
overthrown 
in 
the 
military 
coup 
in 
January 
1986. 
T�olo 
Lelala 
had 
not 
had 
the 
same 
high 
profile, 
but 
in 
the 
1998 
Parliamentary 
elections 
he 
was 
one 
of 
two 
rival 
BNP 
candidates 
for 
the 
Maama 
Constituency, 
the 
other 
being 
a 
former 
Captain 
in 
the 
Lesotho 
Mounted 
Police, 
Pius 
Leseteli 
Malefane. 
The 
Maama 
Constituency, 
which 
includes 
Roma, 
has 
a 
large 
Catholic 
population 
which 
in 
the 
past 
regarded 
the 
BNP 
as 
its 
party. 
It 
was 
therefore 
the 
constituency 
in 
1998 
which 
the 
BNP 
would 
have 
been 
most 
likely 
to 
win. 
However 
the 
dispute 
as 
to 
who 
might 
be 
the 
candidate 
was 
not 
resolved 
by 
the 
closing 
date 
for 
nominations, 
and 
as 
a 
result 
there 
was 
no 
BNP 
candidate 
in 
Roma, 
and 
the 
seat 
was 
held 
by 
the 
sitting 
Lesotho 
Congress 
for 
Democracy 
Member 
of 
Parliament, 
Thabiso 
Melato.

In 
the 
early 
hours 
of 
Friday 
10 
August 
2001, 
the 
kitchen 
and 
living 
room 
areas 
of 
T�olo 
Lelala�s 
house 
at 
Tenhouse, 
Roma, 
were 
badly 
damaged 
by 
an 
explosion, 
although 
fortunately 
no 
members 
of 
the 
family, 
who 
were 
in 
bedrooms 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
house, 
were 
injured. 
T�olo 
Lelala�s 
wife, 
�Mantsane 
Lelala, 
a 
teacher 
at 
St 
Mary�s 
High 
School, 
was 
not 
in 
the 
house 
at 
the 
time, 
because 
she 
had 
been 
seriously 
injured 
in 
the 
road 
accident 
at 
Roma 
on 
28 
July. 
Tragedy 
struck 
T�olo 
Lelala 
a 
second 
time 
less 
than 
48 
hours 
later, 
when 
his 
wife 
died 
from 
her 
injuries 
in 
hospital 
at 
Mapoteng.
</p>
<p>
There 
was 
no 
immediate 
information 
about 
who 
had 
planted 
the 
bomb 
at 
the 
Lelala 
house. 
However, 
it 
was 
noted 
that 
Lelala 
was 
again 
an 
aspirant 
candidate 
for 
the 
coming 
General 
Election 
and 
commanded 
considerable 
support 
amongst 
local 
BNP 
members. 
Despite 
this, 
it 
was 
also 
known 
that 
Pius 
Malefane 
was 
the 
favoured 
candidate 
for 
the 
Maama 
Constituency 
of 
the 
BNP 
leader, 
Major-General 
Justin 
Lekhanya.

</a>
</h1>
<p>
The 
Minister 
of 
Tourism, 
Sports 
&amp; 
Culture, 
Mr 
Hlalele 
Motaung, 
resigned 
after 
the 
government 
vehicle 
that 
he 
was 
driving 
hit 
two 
boys 
aged 
13 
and 
15 
when 
he 
was 
driving 
along 
the 
straight 
stretch 
of 
road 
between 
the 
Phuthiatsana 
Bridge 
and 
Teyateyaneng 
on 
Sunday 
5 
August 
2001. 
One 
boy 
died 
on 
the 
spot 
and 
the 
other 
while 
being 
taken 
to 
hospital. 
The 
vehicle 
rolled 
and 
the 
Minister 
and 
his 
passenger 
were 
also 
injured 
although 
not 
seriously.
</p>
<p>
Government 
vehicles 
are 
not 
supposed 
to 
be 
used 
for 
private 
purposes, 
and 
the 
minister 
shortly 
after 
the 
accident 
announced 
his 
resignation 
which 
took 
effect 
from 
8 
August 
2001. 
The 
case 
recalled 
a 
similar 
one 
on 
Sunday 
4 
July 
1999 
when 
the 
then 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
Dr 
Leketekete 
Ketso, 
also 
had 
to 
resign 
when 
he 
was 
driving 
a 
government 
vehicle 
at 
a 
weekend 
and 
this 
was 
also 
involved 
in 
a 
fatal 
accident.<br>

The

Reshuffle 
of 
Principal 
Secretaries
</a>
</h1>
<p>
The 
most 
senior 
civil 
servant 
within 
a 
particular 
ministry 
was 
at 
Independence 
termed 
Permanent 
Secretary, 
reflecting 
the 
idea 
that 
while 
governments 
might 
come 
and 
go, 
the 
civil 
service 
continued 
to 
exist 
and 
to 
serve 
whoever 
might 
be 
elected 
to 
power. 
This 
idea 
was 
not 
appreciated 
during 
the 
regime 
of 
Leabua 
Jonathan 
who 
politicized 
appointments, 
and 
appointed 
and 
dismissed 
Permanent 
Secretaries 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
�permanent� 
became 
a 
misnomer. 
The 
heads 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
within 
the 
ministries 
were 
as 
a 
result 
restyled 
Principal 
Secretaries, 
and 
experience 
showed 
that 
their 
tenure 
of 
office 
in 
a 
particular 
office 
was 
usually 
quite 
short.
</p>
<p>
The 
present 
government 
has 
retained 
the 
system 
of 
rotating 
Principal 
Secretaries 
and 
indeed 
they 
only 
receive 
two 
year 
contracts 
which 
may 
or 
may 
not 
be 
renewed. 
On 
Friday 
10 
August, 
it 
was 
announced 
that 
a 
number 
of 
changes 
had 
been 
made, 
indeed 
it 
seemed 
more 
as 
if 
a 
game 
of 
musical 
chairs 
was 
being 
played 
by 
top 
civil 
servants, 
particularly 
since 
several 
of 
the 
principal 
secretaries 
in 
question 
had 
been 
in 
their 
present 
posts 
for 
less 
than 
eighteen 
months.
</p>
<p>
In 
the 
changes, 
Tlohang 
Sekhamane, 
formerly 
Permanent 
Secretary 
for 
Education 
became 
the 
new 
Government 
Secretary, 
essentially 
replacing 
Kenneth 
Mohlabi 
Tsekoa, 
who 
was 
now 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
although 
the 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
the 
Public 
Service, 
Semano 
Sekatle 
had 
briefly 
been 
Acting 
Government 
Secretary. 
Mr 
J. 
T. 
Metsing 
who 
had 
been 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Natural 
Resources 
became 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Home 
Affairs; 
Mr 
B. 
Leleka 
who 
had 
been 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Public 
Works 
&amp; 
Transport 
became 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Natural 
Resources; 
Mr 
Monyane 
Mathibeli 
who 
had 
been 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Employment 
and 
Labour 
became 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Public 
Works 
and 
Transport; 
Mr 
P. 
K. 
Motholo, 
who 
had 
been 
briefly 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Environment, 
Gender 
&amp; 
Youth 
Affairs 
became 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Justice, 
Human 
Rights 
and 
Prisons; 
Mrs 
M. 
Ramakoae 
who 
had 
been 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Defence 
became 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Communications; 
Mr 
E. 
M. 
Mohafa 
who 
had 
been 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Home 
Affairs 
became 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Defence.
</p>
<p>
From 
these 
permutations 
it 
can 
be 
seen 
that 
the 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Communications, 
Mr 
Bore 
Motsamai 
and 
the 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Justice, 
Human 
Rights 
and 
Prisons, 
Mr 
Ncholu 
Ncholu, 
both 
lost 
their 
chairs 
in 
the 
latest 
round 
of 
the 
game. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
it 
is 
musical 
chairs 
with 
a 
difference 
because 
the 
number 
of 
chairs 
is 
not 
changing 
and 
they 
lost 
their 
chairs 
because 
new 
persons 
had 
entered 
the 
game. 
These 
were 
Mrs 
M. 
Malie 
who 
occupied 
the 
vacated 
post 
of 
Principal 
Secretary 
of 
Environment, 
Gender 
&amp; 
Youth 
Affairs; 
Mr 
M. 
C. 
Moshapane 
who 
occupied 
the 
vacated 
post 
of 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Education; 
and 
Mr 
M. 
Mandoro 
who 
occupied 
the 
vacated 
post 
of 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Employment 
and 
Labour.
</p>
<p>
There 
were 
two 
other 
new 
appointments 
and 
consequent 
retirements 
from 
principal 
secretaryships. 
Mr 
T. 
Kitleli 
replaced 
Dr 
Makhetha 
Mosotho 
as 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Health 
and 
Social 
Welfare; 
and 
Mr 
T. 
Ramot�oari 
became 
Principal 
Secretary 
for 
Development 
Planning. 
No 
doubt 
there 
was 
an 
expectation 
that 
in 
this 
last 
case 
the 
new 
PS 
might 
ensure 
that 
the 
country 
might 
at 
last 
have 
a 
Seventh 
National 
Development 
Plan, 
particularly 
since 
it 
was 
over 
two 
years 
since 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Lesotho 
Sixth 
National 
Development 
Plan 
1996/7 
- 
1998/9. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Development 
Planning 
under 
its 
previous 
PS 
had 
not 
delivered 
the 
goods, 
the 
more 
so 
because 
the 
Sixth 
Plan 
had 
been 
intended 
to 
be 
a 
rolling 
plan, 
i.e. 
a 
plan 
to 
be 
superseded 
by 
a 
new 
plan 
before 
the 
planning 
period 
had 
expired. 
However, 
the 
outgoing 
principal 
secretary, 
Ms 
Molelekeng 
Rapolaki, 
was 
presumably 
not 
altogether 
disappointed 
with 
her 
move, 
because 
she 
was 
to 
become 
the 
new 
Lesotho 
Ambassador 
to 
the 
USA.

<p>
The

Bursar, 
Mr 
Matsobane 
Putsoa, 
who 
had 
been 
suspended 
during 
an 
on-going 
forensic 
audit, 
was 
reinstated 
on 
Monday 
13 
August 
2001 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
court 
order 
that 
he 
should 
resume 
duty 
and 
that 
the 
university 
should 
present 
any 
case 
against 
him 
and 
give 
him 
a 
fair 
hearing 
within 
24 
hours. 
Despite 
this, 
the 
three 
unions 
representing 
academic, 
non-academic 
and 
senior 
administrative 
staff 
mounted 
a 
joint 
toyi-toyi 
demonstration 
on 
the 
day 
of 
his

asking 
that 
he 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 
university 
pending 
the 
finalization 
of 
the 
forensic

report.
</p>
<p>
A 
petition 
was 
received 
by 
the 
Pro-Vice-Chancellor, 
Dr 
Nqosa 
Mahao, 
who 
said 
that 
management 
was 
both 
abiding 
by 
the 
court 
ruling 
and 
doing 
its 
best 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
forensic

was 
not 
compromised. 
Putsoa 
and 
the

had 
been 
suspended 
by 
the

some 
six 
months

on 
Monday 
13 
August 
and 
was 
expected 
to 
continue 
until 
Sunday 
9 
September 
2001. 
If 
the 
M130 
million 
being 
spent 
on 
the 
election 
seemed 
excessive, 
it 
was 
at 
least 
beneficial 
to 
those 
who 
were 
receiving 
temporary 
employment. 
The 
Independent 
Electoral 
Commission 
was 
employing 
7 
000 
people 
to 
assist 
with 
voter 
registration 
and 
a 
further 
200 
voter 
educators. 
According 
to 
a 
report 
in 
Southern 
Star 
of 
3 
August 
2001, 
registration 
made 
use 
of 
a 
computerised 
registration 
form, 
indelible 
ink 
to 
prevent 
double 
registration 
and 
photographs 
of 
those 
registered

attached 
to 
the

list. 
All 
eligible 
voters 
over 
the 
age 
of 
18 
in 
Lesotho 
are 
bound 
by 
law 
to 
register.
</p>
<p>
In 
the 
event 
the 
period 
to 
Sunday 
9 
September 
proved 
inadequate 
and 
registration 
was 
extended 
for 
three 
further 
weeks 
to 
Sunday 
30 
September 
2001. 
By 
mid-September 
the 
Independent 
Electoral 
Commission 
was 
reporting 
that 
more 
than 
650000 
voters 
had 
registered, 
including 
1740 
prisoners 
for 
whom 
special 
registration 
facilities 
had 
had 
to 
be 
devised. 
IEC 
had 
originally

a

target 
of 
900000

<p>
The 
names 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
newly 
formed 
Urban 
Boards 
for 
eight 
of 
Lesotho�s 
towns 
were 
published 
in 
various 
issues 
of 
the 
Lesotho 
Government 
Gazette 
in 
August. 
The 
number 
of 
members 
in 
each 
council 
ranges 
from 
9 
(in 
the 
case 
of 
Butha-Buthe) 
to 
13 
in 
the 
case 
of 
most 
of 
the 
other 
towns.
</p>
<p>
The 
Urban 
Board 
Act 
1983 
under 
which 
the 
boards 
have 
been 
appointed 
was 
an 
Act 
of 
the 
nominated 
Interim 
National 
Assembly 
during 
the 
Leabua 
Jonathan 
regime. 
It 
gave 
the 
minister 
wide 
powers 
of 
appointment 
or 
otherwise 
choosing 
urban 
boards, 
which 
at 
the 
time 
it 
was 
expected 
would 
be 
used 
to 
appoint 
persons 
politically 
acceptable 
to 
the 
ruling 
party. 
However, 
in 
the 
event, 
the 
government 
of 
the 
time 
chose 
to 
do 
without 
urban 
councils 
altogether, 
and 
there 
was 
no 
local 
government 
anywhere 
until 
the 
Maseru 
City 
Council 
was 
established 
under 
the 
Urban 
Board 
Act 
1983 
during 
the 
period 
of 
military 
rule. 
Currently, 
however, 
this 
Maseru 
City 
Council 
no 
longer 
exists, 
because 
elections 
were 
not 
held 
when 
the 
term 
of 
the 
last 
council 
expired.
</p>
<p>
The 
Local 
Government 
Act 
1996, 
a 
misnomer 
because 
it 
was 
actually 
enacted 
in 
1997, 
has 
been 
on 
the 
statute 
book 
as 
dormant 
legislation 
for 
the 
past 
four 
years, 
only 
requiring 
the 
minister 
to 
bring 
it 
into 
force 
for 
it 
to 
become 
operational. 
Unable 
to 
use 
the 
more 
recent 
and 
more 
appropriate 
legislation, 
staff 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Local 
Government 
experimented 
with 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
Semonkong 
Urban 
Board 
during 
the 
year 
2000 
using 
the 
Urban 
Board 
Act 
1983. 
The 
experiment 
is 
now 
in 
the 
course 
of 
being 
extended 
to 
Lesotho�s 
other 
proclaimed 
urban 
areas. 
However, 
if 
the 
Local 
Government 
Act 
1996 
is 
brought 
into 
force, 
the 
various 
urban 
boards 
now 
being 
created 
will 
disappear 
overnight, 
because 
the 
newer 
act 
once 
in 
force 
repeals 
the 
older 
legislation.<br>

Bribery 
Case 
Resumes
</a>
</h1>
<p>
The 
High 
Court 
case 
before 
Mr 
Justice 
Brendan 
Cullinan 
in 
which 
Masupha 
Sole 
is 
charged 
with 
sixteen 
charges 
of 
bribery 
and 
fraud 
had 
originally 
opened 
on 
Monday 
11 
June. 
The 
sources 
of 
the 
alleged 
bribes 
were 
from 
a 
list 
of 
high 
profile 
construction 
and 
engineering 
firms. 
The 
case 
resumed 
in 
mid-August 
after 
an 
adjournment, 
by 
which 
time 
the 
defence 
attorney, 
Mr 
Hae 
Phoofolo 
had 
been 
joined 
by 
Mr 
Sipho 
Mdhluli, 
a 
former 
Director 
of 
Public 
Prosecutions.
</p>
<p>
Much 
court 
time 
was 
consumed 
on 
whether 
Mr 
Mdhluli 
could 
be 
allowed 
now 
to 
appear 
for 
the 
defence, 
given 
that 
he 
had 
appeared 
for 
the 
Crown 
when 
Sole 
had 
been 
first 
charged 
in 
a 
subordinate 
court. 
Justice 
Cullinan 
initially, 
in 
a 
ruling 
on 
14 
August, 
allowed 
Mdhluli 
to 
co-defend 
Sole, 
stating 
that 
the 
right 
of 
an 
accused 
to 
choose 
his 
own 
legal 
practitioner 
should 
take 
precedence. 
However, 
after 
Guido 
Penzhorn, 
prosecuting 
attorney, 
had 
raised 
extensive 
objections, 
Justice 
Cullinan 
on 
24 
September 
rescinded 
his 
earlier 
ruling

<p>
A 
newspaper 
announcement, 
dated 
14 
August 
2001, 
offered 
rewards 
to 
anyone 
who 
can 
provide 
evidence 
to 
secure 
the 
conviction 
of 
persons 
vandalising 
or 
stealing 
Lesotho 
Electricity 
Corporation 
property. 
The 
announcement 
makes 
reference 
to 
the 
cutting 
of 
cables, 
poles 
and 
lines.
</p>
<p>
Observers 
of 
the 
peri-urban 
landscape 
of 
Maseru 
might 
have 
wondered 
why 
LEC 
had 
not 
taken 
steps 
earlier 
in 
regard 
to 
dismantling 
and 
selling 
for 
scrap 
its 
redundant 
lines. 
Several 
11 
kV 
electricity 
lines 
in 
the 
urban 
periphery 
had 
long 
been 
redundant, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
they 
had 
provided 
self-employment 
for 
some 
individuals 
who 
had 
started 
covertly 
marketing 
the 
poles, 
insulators 
and 
wire 
for 
scrap. 
Around 
Masianokeng, 
for 
example, 
several 
stretches 
of 
wire 
between 
poles 
progressively 
disappeared, 
leaving 
untidy 
wires 
hanging 
from 
the 
poles 
themselves. 
Later 
the 
poles 
also 
disappeared 
except 
for 
a 
few 
isolated 
examples 
located 
in 
residential 
gardens. 
In 
this 
matter, 
thieves 
were 
following 
the 
lead 
given 
by 
those 
responsible 
(perhaps 
they 
were 
the 
very 
same 
persons) 
for 
the 
theft 
of 
telephone 
wires. 
These 
thieves, 
after 
initial 
small 
forays 
into 
lines 
made 
redundant 
by 
fibre 
optic 
cables, 
graduated 
to 
active 
lines. 
By 
two 
years 
ago 
they 
had 
already 
stolen 
the 
whole 
line 
(and 
later 
they 
stole 
the 
poles) 
to 
Thaba-Bosiu, 
which 
now 
has 
no 
fixed 
telephone 
line 
link. 
Other 
rural 
lines 
to 
places 
such 
as 
Pitseng 
have 
suffered 
similar 
loss 
of 
communication 
links.<br>

<a name="Death of Veteran Politician Phoka Chaolana">
Death 
of 
Veteran 
Politician 
Phoka 
Chaolana
</a>
</h1>
<p>
A 
well 
known 
resident 
of 
Roma 
and 
veteran 
politician, 
Phoka 
Chaolana, 
died 
after 
a 
short 
illness 
on 
18 
August 
2001. 
Born 
nearby 
in 
Mokhokhong 
in 
1932, 
Chaolana 
was 
educated 
in 
Catholic 
schools 
in 
Roma 
and 
Kimberley. 
He 
worked 
in 
South 
Africa 
from 
1954 
to 
1958 
and 
it 
was 
during 
that 
time 
in 
1955 
that 
he 
joined 
the 
Basutoland 
African 
Congress, 
forerunner 
of 
the 
Basutoland 
Congress 
Party. 
In 
1960 
he 
became 
Chairman 
of 
the 
BCP 
for 
Maseru 
District. 
He 
was 
a 
staunch 
supporter 
of 
Mohau 
Mokitimi 
(Meshu), 
an 
active 
member 
of 
the 
BCP 
Youth 
League. 
In 
a 
confrontation 
with 
the 
colonial 
administration, 
there 
was 
a 
disturbance, 
part 
of 
the 
responsibility 
for 
which 
was 
attributed 
to 
him, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
he 
spent 
two 
years 
in 
gaol 
from 
1961 
to 
1963. 
In 
1965, 
he 
contested 
the 
Ha 
Maama 
Constituency 
for 
the 
BCP, 
a 
difficult 
task, 
because 
Ha 
Maama 
included 
Roma, 
a 
Catholic 
stronghold 
which 
strongly 
supported 
the 
opposition 
BNP, 
even 
though 
a 
few 
BCP 
members 
like 
himself, 
were 
also 
Catholics.
</p>
<p>
In 
1970, 
Chaolana 
stood 
for 
and 
won 
the 
neighbouring 
Koro-Koro 
Constituency, 
but 
the 
election 
results 
were 
overtaken 
by 
a 
coup 
and 
instead 
of 
ending 
up 
in 
Parliament 
he 
ended 
up 
in 
gaol. 
He 
did, 
however, 
become 
a 
parliamentarian 
in 
1973 
when 
he 
was 
one 
of 
the 
BCP 
members 
who 
accepted 
nomination 
to 
the 
Interim 
National 
Assembly. 
Amongst 
the 
lures 
was 
an 
American 
offer 
to 
host 
a 
visit 
by 
an 
all-party 
group 
of 
MPs, 
and 
Chaolana 
did 
indeed 
go 
on 
the 
tour 
to 
the 
USA.
</p>
<p>
Later 
quarrels 
with 
the 
BCP 
led 
to 
his 
being 
a 
co-founder 
of 
the 
Hareeng 
Basotho 
Party 
which 
unsuccessfully 
fought 
the 
1993 
elections, 
and 
although 
he 
eventually 
returned 
to 
the 
BCP 
fold, 
it 
was 
to 
a 
party 
by 
now 
divided 
by 
internal 
divisions.
</p>
<p>
Phoka 
Chaolana 
had 
business 
interests 
in 
Roma 
close 
to 
the 
university 
gate. 
He 
leaves 
a 
wife, 
daughter-in-law 
and 
three 
grandchildren. 
His 
only 
son, 
Sekoala, 
died 
in 
1998.

Problems 
at

Likalaneng
</a>
</h1>
<p>
A 
number 
of 
people 
who 
lost 
their 
houses 
or 
fields 
to 
the 
Mohale 
Dam 
Project 
were 
resettled 
some 
two 
years 
ago 
in 
the 
outer 
Maseru 
suburb 
of 
Makhoakhoeng 
close 
to 
its 
border 
with 
Ha 
Matala. 
Land 
already 
acquired 
but 
not 
yet 
developed 
by 
the 
Lesotho 
Housing 
and 
Land 
Development 
Corporation 
was 
transferred 
in 
turn 
to 
the 
Lesotho 
Highlands 
Development 
Authority 
who 
built 
a 
small 
compact 
housing 
estate 
for 
the 
former 
Mohale 
residents, 
who 
named 
it 
Likalaneng 
after 
the 
largest 
centre 
in 
the 
Mohale 
catchment.
</p>
<p>
However 
all 
is 
not 
well 
at 
new 
Likalaneng. 
It 
seems 
that 
the 
boundary 
at 
that 
point 
between 
the 
Ha 
Matala 
and 
Makhoakhoeng 
local 
jurisdictions 
is 
not 
clear 
(although 
both 
fall 
under 
the 
Maseru 
City 
Council 
and 
the 
Principal 
Chief 
of 
Thaba-Bosiu), 
and 
the 
people 
who 
originally 
sold 
(or 
were 
compensated 
for) 
their 
mainly 
fallow 
fields 
had 
not 
known 
when 
they 
parted 
with 
their 
land 
that 
there 
was 
the 
prospect 
of 
a 
presumed 
more 
lucrative 
sale 
to 
the 
LHDA. 
Friction 
has 
resulted 
in 
the 
newcomers 
having 
unanticipated 
problems, 
even 
to 
the 
extent 
of 
being 
prevented 
from 
burying 
their 
dead 
in 
the 
local 
village 
cemetery.

<p>
A 
letter 
in 
Moeletsi 
oa 
Basotho 
of 
26 
August 
2001 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs, 
Motsoahae 
Thomas 
Thabane, 
expanded 
on 
the 
problems 
at 
Makhoakhoeng. 
Tom 
Thabane 
is 
himself 
a 
Lekhoakhoa 
and 
a 
Makhoakhoeng 
resident. 
As 
he 
reported, 
the 
matter 
had 
come 
to 
a 
head 
when 
the 
long-term 
residents 
of 
Makhoakhoeng 
had 
not 
been 
represented 
at 
a 
recent 
LHDA 
Stakeholders 
Conference. 
Moreover, 
following 
cordial 
discussions 
which 
had 
been 
proceeding 
with 
the 
late 
Chief 
Executive 
of 
LHDA, 
Makase 
Marumo, 
they 
had 
been 
broken 
off 
by 
his 
successor, 
the 
Acting 
Chief 
Executive.
</p>
<p>
An 
irony 
of 
the 
situation 
is 
that 
Makhoakhoeng 
village 
was 
itself 
founded 
some 
120 
years 
ago 
by 
persons 
resettling 
from 
elsewhere. 
The 
Makhoakhoa 
come 
from 
the 
Mohokare 
headwaters 
east 
of 
Butha-Buthe, 
which 
is 
still 
their 
heartland. 
In 
the 
1870s, 
however, 
three 
Makhoakhoa 
brothers, 
Letsoalo, 
Nkhoakhoa 
and 
Boi, 
were 
engaged 
in 
a 
profitable 
wheat 
export 
business, 
transporting 
wheat 
from 
Butha-Buthe 
to 
Aliwal 
North. 
An 
area 
near 
Masianokeng 
was 
used 
as 
a 
staging 
post 
and 
waggon 
repair 
depot, 
and 
they 
sought 
from 
the 
local 
chief 
Akime 
Mapetla 
permission 
to 
settle 
in 
his 
area, 
because 
it 
was 
well 
placed 
on 
the 
trade 
route 
to 
Aliwal 
North, 
and 
thus 
well 
suited 
as 
a 
site 
for 
managing 
their 
business. 
They 
also 
named 
their 
new 
village 
after 
the 
place 
they 
had 
come 
from 
(hence 
the 
name 
Makhoakhoeng), 
and 
today 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
village 
are 
their 
descendants.

for 
yet 
further 
delays, 
since 
the 
new 
regulation 
will 
be 
difficult 
to 
apply 
fairly 
until 
it 
is 
further 
clarified 
and

The 
hardship 
allowance 
has 
been 
sought 
by 
teachers 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
Arguments 
in 
favour 
of 
it 
quoted 
the 
already 
existing 
�Mokhotlong 
Allowance� 
which 
had 
been 
enshrined 
in 
the 
Public 
Service 
Regulations 
from 
colonial 
days. 
In 
1969, 
this 
had 
been 
set 
at 
M6 
to 
M24 
per 
month 
for 
officers 
serving 
in 
Mokhotlong 
depending 
on 
whether 
they 
were 
married 
or 
single 
and 
also 
depending 
on 
whether 
their 
basic 
salary 
was 
M124 
or 
above 
per 
month. 
Allowing 
for 
inflation, 
M275 
per 
month 
in 
2001 
is 
equivalent 
to 
M8 
in 
1969, 
but 
today 
many 
of 
the 
areas 
designated 
for 
the 
hardship 
allowance 
are 
far 
less 
remote, 
quite 
a 
number 
of 
them 
even 
having 
tarred 
roads. 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
there 
still 
remain 
over 
200 
schools 
in 
areas 
which 
cannot 
be 
reached 
by 
even 
a 
four-wheel 
drive 
vehicle.

Newspapers, 
always 
on 
the 
lookout 
for 
news 
stories 
which 
will 
help 
to 
sell 
more 
copies, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
August 
gleefully 
pounced 
on 
a 
story 
in 
which 
an 
18-year 
old 
man, 
Lehlohonolo 
Khatha, 
of 
the 
Maseru 
suburb 
of 
Khubetsoana 
Ha 
Hlathe 
was 
on 
the 
afternoon 
of 
22 
August 
2001 
caught 
engaged 
in 
bestiality 
with 
a 
black 
pig, 
the 
property 
of 
Mrs 
�Mamponeng 
Monese. 
According 
to 
a 
report 
in 
Public 
Eye 
of 
31 
August 
2001, 
a 
girl 
working 
near 
the 
pigsty 
had 
reported 
�a 
man�s 
head 
bobbing 
up 
and 
down 
in 
the 
pigsty 
and 
making 
movements 
as 
if 
he 
was 
doing 
push-ups�.
</p>
<p>
A 
crowd 
of 
villagers 
including 
Mrs 
Monese 
chased 
Lehlohonolo 
Khatha 
who 
fled 
to 
his 
house, 
where 
his 
grandmother 
closed 
the 
gate 
on 
them 
and 
would 
not 
let 
them 
in, 
even 
though 
Mrs 
Monese 
told 
her 
that 
her 
grandson 
had 
just 
raped 
her 
pig. 
The 
villagers 
then 
proceeded 
to 
the 
chief, 
who 
put 
pressure 
on 
the 
grandmother 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
pig, 
which 
Mrs 
Monese 
said 
she 
no 
longer 
wanted 
to 
keep. 
The 
pig 
was 
later 
slaughtered 
at 
the 
Chief�s 
residence 
and 
eaten 
by 
the 
villagers 
in 
a 
braai.
</p>
<p>
Cases 
of 
bestiality 
appear 
to 
have 
become 
commoner 
in 
recent 
years 
(or 
perhaps 
they 
are 
more 
often 
reported 
in 
the 
press). 
Those 
who 
are 
accused 
often 
state 
in 
their 
defence 
that 
they 
are 
afraid 
to 
have 
relationships 
with 
women 
because 
they 
might 
thereby 
contract 
HIV/AIDS.
</p>
<p>
Sesotho 
versions 
of 
the 
pig 
story 
went 
into 
great 
detail 
and 
in 
one 
newspaper 
occupied 
over 
90 
column 
centimetres.

<p>
Newspapers 
in 
mid-September 
contained 
details 
of 
insults 
being 
traded 
between 
Ministers 
and 
the 
Government. 
The 
Foreign 
Minister, 
Tom 
Thabane, 
reacted 
publicly 
to 
comments 
by 
the 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister, 
Kelebone 
Maope, 
a 
well-known 
supporter 
of 
the 
Lesiba 
Faction 
which 
threatens 
to 
secede 
from 
Prime 
Minister�s 
Lesotho 
Congress 
for 
Democracy. 
According 
to 
The 
Mirror 
of 
19 
September 
2001, 
Maope 
had 
said 
that 
the 
government 
was 
�oppressive�. 
Thabane 
retaliated 
in 
a 
press 
briefing 
that 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
(perhaps 
ill-advisedly) 
had 
asked 
him 
to 
host. 
In 
a 
tirade 
of 
anti-Maope 
remarks, 
Thabane 
referred 
to 
Maope�s 
having 
in 
the 
past 
called 
him 
a 
mandrax 
dealer 
and 
a 
spreader 
of 
unfounded 
rumours 
that 
Thabane�s 
Mercedes 
Benz 
was 
a 
stolen 
vehicle.�I 
will 
personally 
welcome 
his 
resignation 
with 
open 
arms�, 
he 
was 
quoted 
as 
saying.
</p>
<p>
The 
war 
of 
words 
continued 
on 
Tuesday 
18 
September 
2001 
in 
the 
early 
morning 
phone-in 
programme, 
Seboping, 
on 
Radio 
Lesotho, 
when 
both 
Ministers 
were 
available 
to 
answer 
questions 
from 
callers. 
Maope 
defended 
his 
right 
to 
criticize 
the 
government 
when 
it 
did 
not 
perform 
correctly. 
When 
one 
caller, 
who 
identified 
herself 
as 
�Mabashanyana, 
brought 
up 
an 
incident 
from 
Maope�s 
past, 
the 
Deputy 
Prime 
Minister 
lost 
his 
cool, 
alleged 
that 
he 
knew 
that 
she 
was 
really 
the 
wife 
of 
a 
fellow 
cabinet 
minister, 
Vova 
Bulane, 
and 
said 
that 
although 
on 
one 
occasion 
he 
had 
beaten 
up 
a 
woman 
in 
Roma, 
it 
was 
because 
she 
was 
of 
loose 
morals 
(letekatsana). 
This 
particular 
exchange 
became 
the 
talk 
of 
the 
country 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
week, 
and 
confirmed 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
most 
that 
the 
Lesotho 
Congress 
for 
Democracy 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
single 
political 
party. 
However, 
despite 
predictions 
to 
the 
contrary, 
there 
was 
no 
formal 
no 
confidence 
motion 
in 
Parliament 
which 
would 
finally 
announce 
the 
split.
</p>
<p>
However 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
month, 
on 
Friday 
28 
September 
2001, 
it 
became 
known 
that 
Kelebone 
Maope 
had 
resigned 
from 
the 
cabinet, 
thus 
setting 
the 
stage 
for 
a 
new 
party 
to 
emerge.<br>

between 
Lesotho 
and 
South 
Africa: 
Maseru 
Bridge, 
Maputsoe 
and 
Butha-Buthe 
(Caledonspoort). 
Previously 
motorists 
paid 
a 
M2 
toll 
to 
leave 
Lesotho 
at 
the 
border 
post. 
The 
new 
toll 
is 
collected 
on 
arrival 
instead 
of 
departure, 
and 
is 
M5 
for 
vehicles 
under 
2 
tons, 
and 
M15 
for 
vehicles 
between 
2 
tons 
and 
4.5 
tons. 
Vehicles 
larger 
than 
that, 
such 
as 
heavy 
lorries 
and 
buses, 
pay 
M25.
</p>
<p>
The 
collection 
system 
is 
far 
from 
simple. 
There 
are 
no 
less 
than 
three 
gates 
to 
be 
negotiated 
by 
incoming 
traffic 
to 
Lesotho. 
At 
the 
first 
gate 
a 
ticket 
is 
collected. 
The 
driver 
is 
then 
required 
to 
park 
his 
car, 
walk 
into 
the 
border 
post 
building, 
pay 
M5, 
have 
his 
ticket 
encoded 
to 
show 
payment 
has 
been 
made, 
and 
then 
use 
the 
ticket 
to 
exit 
through 
the 
second 
gate 
from 
the 
parking 
area. 
At 
this 
point 
the 
machine 
returns 
the 
ticket, 
which 
is 
then 
used 
again 
and 
retained 
by 
the 
machine 
at 
the 
third 
and 
final 
gate 
where 
customs 
and 
immigration 
are 
cleared.
</p>
<p>
During 
the 
first 
week 
of 
implementation 
at 
Maseru 
Bridge, 
long 
queues 
of 
vehicles 
built 
up. 
The 
parking 
area 
between 
the 
first 
two 
gates 
proved 
totally 
inadequate. 
Vehicles 
were 
supposed 
to 
park 
at 
an 
angle 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
road, 
while 
the 
drivers 
went 
to 
the 
border 
post 
to 
pay. 
However, 
other 
vehicles 
entering 
from 
behind 
and 
looking 
for 
parking 
spaces 
which 
had 
already 
all 
been 
taken 
created 
a 
gridlock 
between 
the 
two 
gates. 
They 
could 
not 
reverse 
through 
the 
closed 
gate 
that 
had 
admitted 
them, 
nor 
could 
they 
park 
and 
walk 
to 
the 
border 
post 
to 
pay. 
Meanwhile 
others 
who 
had 
actually 
managed 
to 
park 
and 
pay, 
could 
not 
reverse 
out 
and 
reach 
the 
second 
gate 
because 
the 
roadway 
was 
saturated 
with 
vehicles 
trapped 
between 
the 
two 
gates. 
Officials 
were 
forced 
to 
override 
the 
second 
gate 
to 
release 
motorists 
unable 
to 
pay 
because 
there 
was 
nowhere 
for 
them 
to 
park.
</p>
<p>
Clearly 
the 
relevant 
statistical 
and 
geometrical 
considerations 
necessary 
to 
have 
a 
workable 
system 
had 
not 
been 
seriously 
considered, 
given 
the 
congestion 
arising 
even 
on 
normal 
working 
days, 
let 
alone 
problems 
that 
might 
be 
encountered 
at 
peak 
holiday 
periods. 
There 
were 
rumours 
that 
pre-purchased 
booklets 
of 
tickets 
were 
going 
to 
be 
made 
available, 
but 
no 
hard 
news 
of 
when 
they 
would 
actually 
become 
available 
and 
when 
and 
where 
they 
could 
be 
purchased.
</p>
<p>
Given 
that 
there 
exists 
a 
M5 
coin, 
it 
is 
a 
mystery 
why 
Lesotho 
did 
not 
introduce 
a 
simple 
single 
gate 
system 
with 
money 
thrown 
into 
a 
basket 
or 
(for 
those 
without 
change 
available) 
paid 
to 
an 
attendant 
at 
a 
parallel 
gate, 
so 
that 
in 
neither 
case 
would 
it 
be 
necessary 
to 
leave 
one�s 
vehicle. 
Such 
a 
system 
is 
used 
on 
motorways 
in 
many 
countries 
throughout 
the 
world 
and 
works 
without 
problems.
</p>
<p>
The 
money 
raised 
by 
the 
new 
system 
is 
supposed 
to 
augment 
the 
Road 
Fund 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
However, 
a 
similar 
if 
not 
greater 
sum 
could 
have 
been 
raised 
simply 
by 
raising 
the 
annual 
motor 
vehicle 
licence 
fee 
so 
that 
it 
kept 
pace 
with 
inflation. 
To 
give 
an 
example, 
the 
tax 
for 
a 
small 
car 
(under 
1000 
kg) 
has 
been 
unchanged 
at 
M105.00 
per 
annum 
since 
1991, 
despite 
annual 
inflation 
ranging 
between 
6.4% 
and 
19.5% 
in 
the 
years 
between. 
Overall 
in 
the 
ten 
year 
period 
since 
1991, 
the 
retail 
price 
index 
has 
risen 
by 
a 
factor 
of 
approximately 
2.4, 
so 
if 
tax 
had 
kept 
pace 
with 
inflation, 
the 
amount 
charged 
should 
now 
be 
M252 
(�20; 
$30), 
still 
a 
modest 
sum 
compared 
with 
other 
countries. 
Moreover, 
such 
a 
revised 
charge 
would 
have 
been 
easy 
to 
implement, 
given 
that 
the 
facilities 
for 
collecting 
are 
already 
in 
place 
at 
the 
Traffic 
Commissioner�s 
Office. 
Road 
tax 
would 
be 
arguably 
more 
fairly 
collected 
in 
this 
way, 
because 
some 
of 
the 
heaviest 
road 
users 
such 
as 
local 
minibus 
taxis 
and 
buses 
do 
not 
pass 
through 
border 
posts 
and 
are 
therefore 
not 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
new 
tax.

The

there

so 
far 
of 
such

being

</p>
<p>
Business 
Report 
of 
26 
September 
2001 
quoted 
an 
Econet 
spokesperson 
as 
saying 
that 
Econet 
was 
building 
a 
cellphone 
network 
in 
Lesotho. 
This 
will 
be 
the 
second 
such 
network 
and 
will 
rival 
the 
network 
of 
VCL, 
the 
independent 
but 
Vodacom 
linked, 
cellphone 
company 
which 
at 
present 
has 
a 
monopoly 
of 
cell 
phones 
in 
Lesotho. 
Recently, 
perhaps 
in 
anticipation 
of 
Econet 
competition, 
VCL 
has 
been 
mounting 
a 
campaign, 
called 
Mocha-o-chele 
(the 
everlasting 
fire) 
to 
get 
people 
to 
adopt 
cellphones 
using 
prepaid 
cards. 
These 
are 
widely 
available 
at 
a 
number 
of 
outlets, 
and 
save 
users 
from 
having 
to 
queue 
at 
the 
VCL 
counter 
in 
Maseru 
to 
buy 
more 
time 
for 
their 
cellphones.
</p>
<p>
Although 
VCL 
has 
so 
far 
had 
a 
theoretical 
monopoly, 
in 
fact 
the 
two 
South 
African 
cellphone 
companies, 
MTN 
and 
Vodacom, 
both 
provide 
services 
which 
�wash� 
over 
the 
border. 
Cellphones 
bought 
in 
South 
Africa, 
which 
generally 
operate 
at 
lower 
rates 
than 
those 
of 
VCL, 
can 
in 
fact 
operate 
in 
much 
of 
Maseru. 
Recently 
both 
MTN 
and 
Vodacom 
have 
put 
up 
high 
masts 
in 
the 
centre 
of 
Ladybrand, 
disguised 
as 
pine 
trees, 
and 
these 
have 
improved 
the 
strength 
of 
their 
signals. 
However, 
legal 
action 
by 
VCL 
has 
been 
instituted 
to 
try 
to 
reduce 
the 
power 
and 
direction 
of 
the 
South 
African 
signal, 
because 
it 
reduces 
VCL�s 
profitability.
</p>
<p>
TeleCom 
Lesotho 
is 
now 
the 
fixed 
line 
operator 
in 
Lesotho, 
for 
at 
least 
those 
fixed 
lines 
which 
are 
still 
in 
place. 
It 
remains 
to 
be 
seen 
how 
fast 
it 
will 
rehabilitate 
the 
network, 
including 
whole 
sections 
of 
lines 
and 
poles 
which 
have 
been 
stolen. 
There 
is 
some 
apprehension 
that 
it 
may 
concentrate 
on 
the 
more 
profitable 
cellphone 
activity, 
the 
right 
to 
operate 
which 
it 
insisted 
on 
before 
signing 
the 
privatization 
agreement. 
If 
so 
this 
will 
be 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
the 
fixed 
line 
system, 
which 
is 
much 
needed 
in 
rural 
areas, 
particularly 
those 
where 
there 
is 
in 
any 
case 
no 
cellphone 
coverage.
</p>
<p>
Cellphones 
are 
now 
very 
much 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Lesotho 
scene, 
no 
doubt 
assisted 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
can 
be 
purchased 
and 
immediately 
operational, 
whereas 
an 
application 
for 
a 
fixed 
line 
may 
slumber 
for 
months 
if 
not 
years 
before 
there 
is 
action 
to 
install 
it. 
So 
far, 
no 
publicity 
seems 
to 
have 
reached 
Lesotho 
about 
the 
statistically 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
risk 
of 
brain 
tumours 
amongst 
frequent 
cellphone 
users.<br>

The 
National 
Manpower 
Secretariat, 
which 
falls 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Development 
Planning, 
provides 
loan 
bursaries 
for 
some 
90% 
of 
the 
students 
at 
the 
National 
University 
of 
Lesotho. 
In 
recent 
years 
it 
has 
been 
criticized 
by 
students 
for 
late 
release 
of 
funds, 
resulting 
in 
their 
being 
so 
financially 
embarrassed 
that 
their 
studies 
suffered. 
In 
the 
2001-2 
academic 
year, 
the 
matter 
had 
become 
serious 
when, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
eighth 
week 
of 
the 
academic 
year, 
book 
allowances 
had 
still 
not 
been 
released 
leaving 
students 
unable 
to 
buy 
essential 
books 
needed 
for 
courses, 
some 
of 
which 
were 
already 
half 
over. 
Moreover, 
the 
large 
number 
of 
students 
who 
now 
stay 
off 
campus 
had 
not 
received 
their 
food 
and 
accommodation 
allowances 
resulting 
in 
their 
having 
in 
order 
to 
stay 
alive 
to 
spend 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
time 
trying 
to 
negotiate 
loans 
with 
anyone 
who 
might 
be 
prepared 
to 
help

</p>
<p>
Matters 
came 
to 
a 
head 
on 
Friday 
28 
September, 
the 
day 
before 
the 
annual 
graduation 
ceremony. 
Earlier 
demonstrations 
in 
Maseru 
seemed 
not 
to 
have 
had 
much 
impact, 
and 
considering 
that 
the 
university 
authorities 
had 
not 
applied 
enough 
pressure 
on 
their 
behalf 
to 
get 
the 
Manpower 
Secretariat 
to 
work 
more 
expeditiously, 
the 
students 
at 
the 
Roma 
Campus 
blockaded 
the 
University 
gate 
preventing 
vehicles 
from 
passing 
through 
for 
most 
of 
the 
day. 
This 
impeded 
preparations 
for 
the 
graduation 
ceremony 
and 
also 
inconvenienced 
many 
university 
staff. 
Large 
numbers 
of 
staff 
commute 
between 
Maseru 
and 
Roma, 
and 
those 
due 
to 
leave 
Roma 
in 
the 
two 
staff 
buses 
at 
5 
p.m. 
found 
the 
buses 
were 
unable 
to 
move. 
Most 
of 
these 
staff 
were 
allowed 
to 
make 
their 
way 
through 
the 
gate 
on 
foot 
and 
they 
then 
took 
minibus 
taxis 
to 
Maseru. 
When 
the 
blockade 
was 
finally 
lifted 
at 
5.40 
p.m., 
there 
were 
just 
five 
passengers 
left 
to 
be 
taken 
by 
the 
two 
large 
university 
buses.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile 
the 
University 
had 
managed 
to 
expedite 
matters 
at 
the 
Maseru 
end. 
The 
Vice-Chancellor, 
Dr 
T. 
H. 
Mothibe, 
addressed 
the 
blockading 
students 
at 
4.30 
p.m. 
He 
announced 
that 
funds 
for 
those 
who 
stay 
off 
campus 
had 
been 
released 
and 
paid 
into 
their 
accounts 
in 
the 
bank 
that 
very 
day 
(although 
given 
that 
the 
bank 
was 
already 
closed, 
students 
could 
not 
immediately 
access 
the 
money). 
The 
money 
for 
the 
book 
allowances 
would 
be 
available 
the 
following 
Monday.
</p>
<p>
Book 
allowances 
have 
in 
recent 
years 
become 
a 
controversial 
matter. 
At 
one 
time, 
they 
were 
paid 
to 
the 
university 
bookshop, 
and 
students 
had 
to 
use 
them 
for 
book 
purchases 
and 
nothing 
else. 
Some 
20 
years 
ago, 
after 
representations 
from 
students, 
the 
allowances 
were 
paid 
to 
them 
directly, 
but 
it 
was 
observed 
that 
relatively 
few 
book 
purchases 
were 
made 
and 
the 
money 
was 
spent 
on 
other 
things 
such 
as 
ghetto 
blasters 
and 
drink 
in 
the 
case 
of 
men, 
and 
clothes 
in 
the 
case 
of 
women. 
Most 
books 
required 
were 
photocopied, 
which 
proved 
cheaper, 
even 
though 
it 
breached 
the 
copyright 
law.
</p>
<p>
With 
effect 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
2000-1 
academic 
year 
the 
government 
was 
determined 
that 
book 
allowances 
would 
be 
mainly 
spent 
on 
books. 
It 
raised 
the 
book 
allowance 
to 
M3000, 
but 
paid 
this 
to 
the 
bookstore. 
There 
was 
a 
long 
student 
protest 
strike, 
but 
in 
the 
end 
the 
students 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
obtaining 
access 
to 
more 
than 
M800 
of 
the 
allowance. 
The 
bookstore 
sold 
more 
books 
in 
2000-1 
than 
it 
had 
ever 
done 
before, 
although 
there 
were 
many 
complaints 
that 
required 
books 
were 
not 
available 
when 
needed.
</p>
<p>
In 
2001-2 
after 
negotiations 
with 
the 
new 
Vice-Chancellor 
and 
government, 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
the 
students 
would 
receive 
M1800 
of 
the 
book 
allowance 
in 
cash 
and 
M1200 
would 
be 
deposited 
per 
student 
at 
the 
bookstore. 
However, 
with 
the 
academic 
year 
already 
one 
quarter 
over, 
neither 
the 
bookstore 
nor 
the 
students 
had 
received 
this 
money, 
and 
this 
occasioned 
the 
28 
September 
blockade.
</p>
<p>
Acquiring 
books 
at 
Roma 
is 
a 
lengthy 
process 
given 
the 
speed 
of 
service 
at 
the 
bookshop, 
and 
students 
have 
been 
known 
to 
camp 
outside 
the 
bookstore 
from 
midnight 
onwards 
so 
that 
they 
can 
be 
first 
in 
the 
queue 
the 
following 
morning. 
The 
money 
for 
books 
was 
being 
released 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
half-term 
break, 
a 
holiday 
week. 
However 
it 
seemed 
likely 
that 
many 
students 
would 
be 
spending 
the 
break 
from 
studies 
standing 
in 
line. 
When 
classes 
resumed 
a 
week 
later, 
if 
they 
persevered 
and 
the 
stocks 
in 
the

The 
26th 
Convocation 
for 
the 
Conferment 
of 
Degrees 
at 
the 
National 
University 
of 
Lesotho 
Roma 
Campus 
took 
place 
in 
perfect 
spring 
weather 
on 
Saturday 
29 
September 
2001. 
According 
to 
the 
programme 
for 
the 
occasion, 
a 
total 
of 
1101 
degrees, 
certificates 
and 
diplomas 
were 
to 
be 
awarded, 
but 
a 
few 
more, 
where 
results 
had 
come 
in 
late, 
were 
in 
fact 
actually 
awarded. 
7 
students 
were 
awarded 
Masters 
degrees, 
4 
of 
them 
Masters 
of 
Education 
and 
3 
Masters 
of 
Science 
in 
Economics. 
In 
the 
Faculty 
of 
Science 
&amp; 
Technology, 
there 
were 
5 
BSc 
(Honours) 
degrees, 
17 
Bachelors 
of 
Science 
with 
Education, 
and 
67 
Bachelor 
of 
Science 
degrees. 
Given 
the 
present 
manpower 
demand, 
these 
were 
likely 
to 
be 
the 
students 
most 
likely 
to 
find 
employment. 
Other 
degrees 
awarded 
were 
118 
in 
the 
Faculty 
of 
Social 
Sciences, 
88 
in 
the 
Faculty 
of 
Law, 
and 
175 
in 
the 
Faculties 
of 
Education 
and 
Humanities, 
of 
which 
94 
were 
BEd 
degrees 
which 
would 
have 
been 
mainly 
awarded 
to 
students 
likely 
to 
become 
high 
school 
teachers. 
25 
students 
also 
received 
the 
Bachelor 
of 
Science 
in 
Agriculture 
degree, 
for 
whom 
the 
employment 
outlook 
must 
be 
less 
certain, 
given 
the 
lack 
of 
government 
posts 
in 
agriculture 
which 
pay 
salaries 
at 
appropriate 
scales.
</p>
<p>
There 
were 
15 
students 
who 
obtained 
the 
Postgraduate 
Diploma 
in 
Education 
and 
39 
(many 
of 
these 
from 
Namibia) 
who 
received 
the 
Postgraduate 
Diploma 
in 
Labour 
Law. 
However, 
many 
of 
the 
awards 
were 
for 
sub-degree 
level 
diplomas 
and 
certificates 
obtained 
through 
part-time 
study 
mainly 
in 
evening 
classes 
at 
the 
university�s 
Institute 
of 
Extra-Mural 
Studies 
campus 
in 
Maseru. 
Of 
these, 
230 
students 
were 
awarded 
either 
the 
Certificate 
or 
Diploma 
in 
Business 
Studies, 
55 
received 
Diplomas 
in 
Mass 
Communication 
and 
53 
received 
Diplomas 
in 
Adult 
Education. 
Just 
one 
student 
was 
awarded 
the 
Diploma 
in 
Science 
Education.
