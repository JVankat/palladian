        <p align="left" class="style1">HST-3000 </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">The Acterna HST-3000 is a modular, hand-held test tool that scales to address a broad spectrum of different access network technology testing needs, from the physical layer to the application layer. It was the first hand-held field test tool to provide basic turn-up and troubleshooting of VoIP deployment, supporting physical layer analysis through packet metrics, signaling analysis and voice quality determination. HST-3000 capabilities allow packet capture of live VoIP calls, including VoIP call storage and an integrated FTP capability to send captured VoIP calls to be analyzed by Acterna's PVA-1000 software. The HST was created to improve efficiency and lower the costs of installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting business and residential services and networks. The HST-3000 combines copper, voice and data service testing features with unparalleled process automation capabilities in a lightweight, battery-operated unit. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">By adding ADSL2+ and IP Video test options, the HST-3000 breaks new ground in test support for triple-play service deployments and extends its capabilities for installation and maintenance crews who will be responsible for turn-up and troubleshooting these new services. The Acterna HST-3000 VoIP Tester was named Product of the Year for 2002 by INTERNET TELEPHONY magazine. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">NetComplete</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Delivering the service assurance end-to-end testing needs for service providers, Acterna's NetComplete Service Assurance Solutions support VoIP, Metro Ethernet and IPTV. NetComplete is the core component of Acterna's Service Assurance Solutions that delivers end-to-end applications for service turn-up verification, fault isolation and troubleshooting, performance monitoring and capacity planning targeted for the service provider environment. Service providers can maximize revenue while lowering costs by removing operational inefficiencies within and between these areas. Acterna's QT-600 is a new NetComplete Distributed Ethernet Testhead that supports providers delivering triple play (voice, video and data) services. In combination with NetComplete's Test OSS, called NetAnalyst NGT, service providers can use the QT-600 to verify turn-up of services without coordinated dispatches to multiple remote sites. NetAnalyst Test Management software provides operators with an open platform (Web and XML based), intelligent test system that supports multi-vendor, multi-protocol, and multi-architecture networks. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">ONMS</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Residing on a server or desktop, Acterna's OFM software enables customers to address the state of the network from their fingertips. This powerful automated mapping, facilities management, and geographic information system (AM/FM/GIS) application consolidates data entered manually or through other applications. All fiber optic network documentation including fiber route maps, distribution panel graphics, OTDR traces can be easily retrieved, cross-referenced, and shared among multiple users. Network operators have access to all of their networks' geographic and functional components and can track, document, and monitor an unlimited number of circuit wavelengths for each physical fiber path while O&amp;M staff can initiate queries from any physical point in the network, including the field. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">The Acterna RFTS offers network operators significant commercial advantage through increased productivity, reduced network down time and easier, faster network provisioning. The RFTS monitors the network continuously, alerting operators and managers to faults as they occur. The ONMS also provides real-time network status and performance with efficient preventative maintenance schedules, faster, low-cost service provisioning with efficient management of the cable installation and commissioning process, and rapid detection and accurate location of fiber and DWDM degradation. <br>

        <p align="left" class="style1">Bluetooth goes VoIP with CTP </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">AVM is an active member of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group and has pushed the standardisation of this radio technology further. Bluetooth is successfully marketed by AVM in a dedicated product group consisting of PBXs and USB adapters for various scenarios. The Cordless Telephony Profile (CTP) is used for voice transmission via Bluetooth. That make it possible to use Bluetooth with CTP also as an application for DSL VoIP PBXs. Structurally, integrated as well as modular solutions become possible. A scenario emerges in which a Bluetooth-enabled GSM phone in the homezone automatically becomes part of the DSL VoIP PBX and can accordingly make low-cost calls of the Internet. Modern Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones mark the availability of high performance attractive terminal devices for this innovative technology. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Making WLAN Secure And Convenient </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Using AVM's Stick&amp;Surf method computers can, without further configuration, establish a secure connection to to any FRITZ!Box Fon WLAN equipped with a USB host. The stick is inserted briefly in the USB host so that security settings and network keys or encryption methods are transmitted automatically from the FRITZ!Box to the FRITZ!WLAN USB stick. The stick is then removed from the FRITZ!Box and inserted in the computer. &quot;Stick&amp;Surf&quot; is a key aspect of the simplicity of AVM product installation. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">As a result, the AVM &quot;Stick&amp;Surf&quot; procedure leads to a highly secure system, consisting of WLAN router (FRITZ!Box) and up to 254 WLAN clients (FRITZ!WLAN USB stick), for wireless communication in local networks. The newest speed standards such as IEEE 802.11g++ and security standards such as WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i) are used. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Powering VoIP with ISDN</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Voice over IP is a central part of AVM's development and product strategy. Drawing from the production of millions of compact PBXs and DSL modems, AVM has combined these two technologies since 2004 in the product portfolio and enhanced them with extra options such as WLAN, Ethernet, USB (port/host), and ISDN NT. This complete family of DSL VoIP PBX routers allows the use of legacy terminal devices (analog or ISDN) for VoIP without a PC and has taken possession of the market for Internet telephony. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Adhering to the technical vision of making VoIP at least as good as the fixed-line network, popular features and qualitative aspects of ISDN are being ported to VoIP. This creates a foundation for the marketing of modern and &quot;future proof&quot; services for the vendor of VoIP services and also from the point of view of the terminal devices. </p>
