        REGULATION OF INTERNET PHARMACY PRACTICE, 10 Annals Health L. 75 (2001)</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The widespread and growing use of pharmaceutical products as a
        favored therapeutic modality in modern health care poses significant
        challenges for the pharmacy profession. Traditionally viewed as
        guardians of the nation's supply of medically useful drugs, the
        responsibilities of pharmacists are expanding because of the rapidly
        increasing volume of prescription orders, and also because of the
        heightened demand for expanded pharmacist services in drug therapy
        monitoring. Pharmacists are responsible for assuring absolute accuracy
        in their traditional dispensing role. This standard of perfection is an
        unreachable benchmark for any system of service or product provision,
        but pharmacists must nonetheless strive to achieve this ideal goal by
        initiating &quot;sufficient institutional controls&quot; over their
        order processing practices. In addition, pharmacists have increasingly
        been held to have a &quot;duty to warn&quot; when the special
        circumstances *76 of a prescription suggest to a pharmacist that a
        patient may be at risk in a way that either the patient or the
        prescribing physician may not appreciate. Pharmacists are being asked to
        do more for each patient, and there are more patients whose needs
        pharmacists are being asked to meet.</p>
        <p>Owing to the increasing complexity of modern pharmacotherapy, and to
        the uniform adoption of the clinically-oriented Pharm.D. degree,
        contemporary pharmacists find themselves facing an unprecedented window
        of opportunity, during which the practice of &quot;pharmaceutical
        care&quot; could finally become a reality. Conceived as a complement to
        medical care and nursing care, the purpose of pharmaceutical care is to
        address the well-documented problem of preventable drug-related
        morbidity. The value of reliance on those pharmacists who practice
        pharmaceutical care to promote good outcomes for patients and to prevent
        adverse drug effects has been empirically established. *77 Yet, despite
        obvious advantages over the traditional product- oriented focus of
        dispensing pharmacists, this new patient-centered approach to pharmacy
        practice has been slow to evolve. Time constraints faced by pharmacists,
        information deficits concerning specific patients and their unique
        needs, and the limits of the physical settings in which pharmacists
        practice, pose significant barriers to the maturation of pharmaceutical
        care from academic theory to practice reality. There is a very real
        possibility that the logistics of traditional health care will prevent
        pharmacists from re- professionalizing to accept responsibility for the
        outcomes of drug therapy.</p>
        <p>Internet pharmacy has the potential to overcome barriers that exist
        within traditional pharmacy practice, thereby enabling success with
        pharmaceutical care. Through alliances between local pharmacies and
        their Internet-based partners, prescription order processing can be
        moved offsite to &quot;central fill&quot; locations, reducing the volume
        of prescription orders to process at local pharmacies. Routine questions
        about medications can be answered by online pharmacists using email or
        other electronic (eventually real-time video) connections with patients,
        further addressing the current workload constraints that exist at most
        local pharmacies. Knowledge of a patient's diagnosis, results of
        laboratory tests, and established drug monitoring parameters, largely
        unavailable to pharmacists at present, can be made accessible to local
        pharmacists through the Internet. Pharmacies *78 and pharmacists can use
        the Internet to integrate themselves with other care providers and
        institutions, opening up new opportunities for public service that
        simply cannot occur in the current disconnected system that locks
        pharmacists out of the mainstream of health care.</p>
        <p>This article suggests that pharmacy regulators could best protect and
        promote the public health through responsive Internet regulation that
        facilitates expanded pharmaceutical care practices. Regulation of
        Internet pharmacy should avoid restrictions that inhibit direct online
        care and product provision by pharmacists. Tough regulation directed
        toward Internet-based &quot;rogue pharmacies&quot; runs the risk of
        replicating the &quot;war on drugs&quot; that has for many years been
        fought by the Drug Enforcement Administration and other law enforcement
        agencies with only modest success. This crusade to protect the public
        from the scourge of drug addiction has prevented the diversion of many
        narcotic controlled substances, but it has also had the unintended, yet
        foreseeable effect of decreasing access to appropriate analgesic
        medications, leading to uncontrolled pain for many patients. Tough
        regulation of Internet pharmacy could similarly restrict beneficial
        pharmaceutical care activities if regulations were so broad in scope and
        uncompromising in application as to have a &quot;chilling&quot; effect
        on even the most well intentioned of providers. Most pharmacists are
        highly risk averse. They adopt practices that steer them far clear of
        regulatory violations, and the threat of even an accusation of
        impropriety is often sufficient to alter practice patterns. With regard
        to Internet pharmacy, the challenge pharmacy regulators must meet is to
        develop a regulatory *79 approach that is designed to prevent
        inappropriately risky medication use, while leaving unaffected the
        online innovations that can enhance the appropriate use of medications
        and improve a patient's quality of life.</p>
        <p>Part I of this article describes established principles of drug
        regulation, and it explains how those principles can be applied to
        Internet pharmacy. In Part II, the potential hazards of over-regulation
        are reviewed. Outcomes-oriented responsive regulation is described as an
        emerging trend, and opportunities are noted for use of the Internet to
        improve outcomes for patients. Part III criticizes state paternalism, if
        it restricts informed patient choice of a provider of pharmaceutical
        products and services. This article concludes that the most appropriate
        method for regulation of Internet pharmacy, in fact the only method that
        has a reasonable chance of success, is the Verified Internet Pharmacy
        Practice Site (&quot;VIPPS&quot;) program of the National Association of
        Boards of Pharmacy (&quot;NABP&quot;).</p>
        <p>I. State and Federal Regulation of Pharmacy</p>
        <p>Pharmacists are required to comply with federal laws relating to the
        distribution of drug products. Once a drug has enter interstate
        commerce, any person subsequently holding it for sale must be in
        compliance with both the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&quot;FDCA&quot;)
        and the Controlled Substances Act (&quot;CSA&quot;). Pharmacists must
        also comply with state laws regulating *80 the practice of the
        profession of pharmacy. In most states, professional regulation of
        pharmacy is accomplished through a pharmacy act in which the legislature
        creates and empowers a board of pharmacy. The state board of pharmacy
        promulgates rules and regulations, which it enforces along with the
        provisions of the pharmacy act.</p>
        <p>Internet pharmacy does not fit well into the standard regulatory
        scheme under which the federal government regulates the drug product,
        while state government regulates the pharmacy profession. Distinctions
        between product distribution and the provision of professional services
        become blurred, and the separate states or countries in which providers
        and recipients of services are located make it difficult to know who, if
        anyone, has jurisdiction over a transaction. Consider the following
        hypothetical example: Using the Internet, a Florida patient orders
        pharmaceutical products from an Internet site that purports to be
        located in Texas and promotes online availability of prescription-only
        medications without a prescription. In reality, the site is linked from
        a Texas site to another site in Nevada, and the patient never knows
        this. A questionnaire filled out by the patient is reviewed by a
        physician in Rhode Island, who receives the patient's
        electronicallysubmitted information from the site in Nevada, and then
        authorizes the patient to receive the requested prescription-only
        medication. An email message is then sent to the patient by an Illinois
        pharmacy, offering to discuss the medication with the patient if the
        patient has any questions. This pharmacy includes in its message a
        hyperlink to a Louisiana site that describes in detail how to use the
        prescription-only medication, and the possible side effects of the
        medication. Several days later, a parcel with a return address of a
        North Carolina pharmacy arrives in Florida, and inside is a prescription
        vial containing the medication, labeled with the name and address of a
        different North Carolina pharmacy. If problems should arise for the
        patient, it would be difficult to know what regulatory authority has
        jurisdiction over the transaction. Even if substantive law is clear, the
        procedure of enforcement is certain to be time- consuming and
        unreliable.</p>
        <p>The possible scenario described above is certainly not the only way
        for an Internet pharmacy to operate; nor it is necessarily typical of
        Internet pharmacies. There are some sites, many of *81 them
        &quot;offshore,&quot; that completely ignore the formality of requiring
        a physician's authorization to dispense, and they readily ship
        prescription-only medications to anyone who has the ability to pay for
        them, without even the pretense of a physician-reviewed questionnaire.
        On the other hand, the well-known dispensing-only sites, many of which
        have developed alliances with large community pharmacy chains, will
        meticulously follow all applicable legal requirements, and will not
        provide prescription-only products unless a patient has provided a valid
        prescription from the patient's own physician. These varied ways of
        conducting an Internet pharmacy business lead to differing needs of
        regulation to protect the public health.</p>
        <p>A. Applying The Law To Internet Pharmacy</p>
        <p>The outright sale of prescription-only pharmaceuticals without
        authorization from a licensed prescriber is the dispensing activity that
        most clearly violates the FDCA. Under the FDCA, a drug is classified as
        prescription-only for one of two reasons: (1) either it is deemed unsafe
        for use except under the supervision of a state-licensed prescriber, or
        (2) it is limited to prescription-only use by its approved New Drug
        Application. The act of dispensing a drug contrary to this prescription
        requirement is an act that results in the drug being deemed misbranded
        while held for sale. Misbranding is a serious violation of the FDCA that
        can result in seizure of a product, criminal prosecution of those who
        have distributed it, and an injunction to prevent further distribution.
        Internet pharmacy sites that make no attempt to involve a physician in
        an authorization to dispense prescription-only medications are clearly
        in violation of the FDCA. They have misbranded the product.</p>
        <p>When a prescription-only drug is dispensed pursuant to a physician's
        authorization that results from the review of an online questionnaire
        filled out by a patient, application of the FDCA is not so
        straightforward. It has been suggested that when a physician prescribes
        based solely on the review of an electronic message from a patient,
        there is legally not a &quot;prescription,&quot; because there is no
        legitimate physician-patient relationship and/or because a legal
        prescription results only when a physician has *82 physically examined a
        patient. If this interpretation is correct, then dispensing pursuant to
        an invalid physician's order would constitute a misbranding violation as
        described above. However, this legal approach presents potential
        difficulties, because in traditional prescribing there may not always be
        a physician-patient relationship that meets these narrow legal
        standards. Furthermore, problems might arise in the regulation of
        desirable innovative approaches to telemedicine, where physicians and
        patients may be remote from each other and not personally known to each
        other, if regulators were to adopt a very narrow construction of what
        physician behaviors are necessary to create a legally sufficient
        prescription. Developing strict standards to evaluate the conduct of
        physicians and patients, as a prerequisite to the recognition of a valid
        physician-patient relationship, might be an approach that creates more
        problems than it solves. Regulatory intrusion in the physician-patient
        relationship may put a stop to inappropriate Internet pharmacy
        practices, but it could also interfere with legitimate traditional
        health care or with valuable innovation in medical practice.</p>
        <p>The FDCA offers an alternative to the potentially restrictive
        regulatory approach centered on defining the attributes of an acceptable
        physician-patient relationship. Rather than creating a new set of rules
        that requires an evaluation of the character of a prescriber-patient
        relationship (a perilous and potentially controversial activity),
        regulators could instead consider using existing statutory requirements
        that apply to those who dispense under prescriptive authority resulting
        from a diagnosis made through the mail. As is so often the case with the
        FDCA, this requirement depends heavily on the misbranding provisions of
        the Act. Under the FDCA, current misbranding provisions require
        extensive disclosure of information, at such a high level that
        dispensers could not possibly comply. Yet, dispensers escape *83 what
        would otherwise be a misbranding violation, through a specific statutory
        exemption that relieves them of the need for compliance with exhaustive
        information disclosure requirements. As long as their prescription vial
        is properly labeled with the patient's name, prescriber's name and
        directions for use, according to information provided in the
        prescription being filled, they are eligible for the exemption. The FDCA
        states, however, that the exemption from the extensive disclosure
        requirement does not apply to &quot;any drug dispensed in the course of
        the conduct of a business of dispensing drugs pursuant to a diagnosis by
        mail.&quot; Thus, an online pharmacy that conducts a business of
        dispensing pursuant to diagnosis by email would lose the exemption, be
        forced to comply with extensive misbranding provisions that cannot be
        met, and would therefore be in violation of the misbranding section of
        the FDCA. This statutory provision is, in effect, an exemption from an
        exemption. It does not apply simply to the act of prescribing by mail,
        or even to occasional acts of dispensing by mail. What is made illegal
        by the FDCA under this provision is the conduct of a business that
        promotes the availability of prescription-only drugs through diagnosis
        and prescribing by electronic mail, and then dispenses prescription
        drugs under such tenuous authority. Drugs dispensed in this way are
        misbranded under the FDCA. Thus, no intrusive evaluation of the
        physician-patient relationship is necessary. If email is considered mail
        (not a huge stretch of the imagination), then Internet pharmacies that
        conduct a business of dispensing medications prescribed through
        evaluation of electronic information have violated the law.</p>
        <p>The only online pharmaceutical dispensing practice that clearly
        complies with the FDCA is the pharmacy practice that insists on a
        patient presenting, in some way, a prescription issued by the patient's
        local physician. In many ways, this pharmacy practice model is merely an
        advanced version of mail-service pharmacy. Over the Internet, such
        practices offer quicker, more consistent, and more comprehensive service
        than the service that can be provided through the mail. Although
        somewhat controversial when they were introduced several decades ago,
        quality concerns about mail-service pharmacies have *84 been resolved.
        This is an efficient and effective way to provide pharmaceutical
        products to those patients whose drug therapy monitoring services are
        furnished through another means. From a regulatory perspective, there
        are no critical FDCA issues for Internet pharmacies that function as
        mail-service pharmacies have. These are state- licensed businesses. They
        are required to be licensed in most states to which they ship dispensed
        pharmaceutical products, and they are subject to the same controls as
        any pharmacy within the state to which pharmaceutical products are
        dispensed. There is no evidence that these Internet pharmacies present
        threats to the public health that differ significantly from those of any
        other state regulated pharmacy practice.</p>
        <p>B. Enforcing The Law With Internet Pharmacies</p>
        <p>The enforcement of pharmacy laws by state boards of pharmacy and
        other state regulators faces obvious obstacles when an allegedly
        dangerous Internet pharmacy practice is located out-of-state. In the
        absence of evidence that an in-state pharmacy poses a risk of harm to
        in-state patients, state pharmacy regulators may have a difficult time
        justifying the use of resources for the enforcement of state laws. When
        a patient in one state is placed at risk of harm by a pharmacy in
        another state, regulators in both states must cooperate for them to be
        effective in their joint enforcement. Brick-and-mortar pharmacies can be
        investigated through cooperative efforts of regulators in two states,
        and problems with quality can be addressed in much the same way as is
        done with in-state pharmacies. However, in the time it takes to
        discover, investigate, and provide notice to an alleged Internet
        pharmacy violator, the fast-paced entrepreneur responsible for the
        original pharmacy site may very well have closed that site and moved to
        a different Internet location. The ability of businesses to link sites
        to each other makes it difficult for regulators to know against whom
        enforcement action should be initiated. Moving targets are hard to
        regulate, and the Internet facilitates frequent moving.</p>
        <p>Despite these practical difficulties, there have been high-profile
        actions by attorneys general in several states to stop illegal Internet
        pharmacy practice. These actions usually charge that subject pharmacies
        have dispensed prescription drugs without a license in the state. They
        may also charge a violation of state *85 consumer fraud laws. As
        well-intended as these actions may be, it remains to be seen whether
        state attorneys general can maintain their level of commitment to this
        resource-intensive issue. The results of the recent state actions are
        not encouraging. One of the most active enforcers, Kansas Attorney
        General Carla Stovall, has estimated that of 400 online pharmacies
        believed to be selling drugs in the United States, only six were
        operating within the law, and only a fraction of the illegal operators
        were being investigated by a government agency. Meanwhile, the chief
        investigator of unlicensed medical practice in Florida disclosed that he
        had only two people to investigate the entire health care industry.
        Given the national scope and technical complexity of the problem, in the
        face of limited state resources, it is not surprising that state
        regulators have turned to federal authorities for help.</p>
        <p>As the agency primarily responsible for regulating drug approval,
        production, distribution and marketing, the FDA finds itself not
        particularly well situated to regulate professional practice. Yet, when
        the professional practice of pharmacy is used as a charade to protect
        large scale drug distributors from federal scrutiny, the FDA will not
        hesitate to weigh in with enforcement of federal laws usually applied
        only to manufacturers. For example, in the early 1990s, the FDA began to
        enforce federal laws against massive compounding by a small number of
        high-volume interstate distribution businesses that were masquerading as
        local pharmacies. The federal enforcement action occurred only after
        state regulators were unable to protect the public from what had become
        an unregulated industry of clandestine*86 drug manufacturers. An
        amendment to the FDCA was necessary to define FDA's regulatory authority
        in this area.</p>
        <p>The FDA has begun a similar enforcement campaign against Internet
        pharmacies, both foreign and domestic. However, the issues are more
        complex than they were with compounding pharmacies, and the targets of
        regulation are far more difficult to find. Federal enforcement
        activities directed at Internet pharmacy sites outside the United States
        have been of two types: (1) direct action against providers to put them
        out of business, in cooperation with local law enforcement authorities,
        and (2) distribution of an Import Alert to customs inspectors, designed
        to deny entry into the United States of illegal shipments from offshore
        Internet pharmacies. Actions directed toward domestic sites have been
        equally as determined, but far less public. The agency has provided
        support for state enforcement activities, and it has stressed the need
        for more stringent self-regulation by the industry. Authority for
        federal enforcement has been based primarily on a conclusion that
        Internet sites are directed to the public, therefore strict rules for
        promotion of drugs directly to consumers apply. Most Internet sites do
        not comply with the rigid requirements for advertising of
        prescription-only drugs directly to the public, thus they are considered
        in violation of the FDCA. This is an indirect approach to regulation
        that may be technically valid, but it uses statutory authority that was
        clearly intended to address public health threats other than those
        presented by Internet pharmacy. Meanwhile, the agency waits for Congress
        to provide more specific statutory direction.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, no matter how tough state and federal regulators may be
        toward Internet pharmacies, their efforts will fall short of even the
        most modest goals. Just as illicit drug use has not been significantly
        curtailed, because enforcement authorities *87 cannot be on every street
        corner, every hour, of every day, Internet pharmacy regulators will
        discover that they cannot monitor all web sites at all times. The
        decades-long failure of narcotic drug control authorities to prevent
        importation of illicit drugs into the country should instruct that the
        country's border cannot be made secure from anything but a small number
        of shipments made by offshore Internet sites to domestic medication
        users. And there is a terrible risk that strong regulation would stifle
        the Internet's growth and innovation, while doing little to prevent
        inappropriate medication use. Onerous Internet pharmacy regulation could
        have the unintended effect of deterring the development of novel
        approaches to care provision that reduce problems with drug therapy and
        enable alliances that improve the quality of care.</p>
        <p>II. The Costs of Over Regulation</p>
        <p>As noted above, there is clear evidence of a correlation between
        aggressive regulation of pharmacists and conservative pharmacy practices
        that do not consistently meet the needs of patients. Given the choice
        between a behavior that may raise a regulatory red flag but is clearly
        beneficial to a patient and an alternative behavior that is safe from a
        regulatory perspective but may not provide all available benefits to
        patients, many risk-averse pharmacists will adopt the latter strategy.
        This is a sobering lesson learned through recognition of the barriers to
        effective pain management created by regulation of controlled substance
        medications. The under-treatment of pain is a serous problem in the
        American health care system, and one cause of the problem is a
        perception that regulators are intolerant of innovative pain management
        practices that challenge traditional notions of appropriate care. Even
        though recent changes in policy-on-paper have clarified that
        restrictions on drug diversion should not play any role in restrictions
        on patient care, policy-in-practice has yet to reflect the more tolerant
        perspective of regulators. Once the fear of regulatory action becomes
        ingrained in the mind of a practitioner, it is difficult to dispel.</p>
        <p>*88 Assertive and much-publicized enforcement directed against
        Internet pharmacy sites has the potential to deter innovative Internet
        pharmacy practices, in much the same way as aggressive regulation
        directed at diversion of narcotics has deterred innovative pain
        management practices. It is not always the reality of enforcement that
        matters as much as it is the perception that one is subject to
        enforcement action. Regulation is a powerful positive tool that can
        enable practitioners to meet their responsibilities to patients and
        improve outcomes for patients, but regulation can also prevent the
        development of new and valuable approaches to practice. Long viewed as
        being separate from the practice of health care and as a necessary evil
        to be tolerated but not welcomed, health care regulation has recently
        experienced a renaissance. Responsive regulation, as opposed to
        restrictive regulation, has the potential to bring health care
        regulators into the mainstream of health care. It is important that
        regulators of Internet pharmacy recognize the need to be specific in
        their enforcement activities and responsive to needs of the health care
        system. They must complement enforcement and discipline with at least
        equal emphasis on activities geared toward enabling productive change
        through regulation.</p>
        <p>A. The Promise of Responsive Regulation</p>
        <p>Responsive regulation promotes improvements in the quality of care.
        The quality improvement function of responsive regulation will be said
        to have succeeded when aggregated data measuring the professional
        performance of a group of licensed practitioners indicate that the mean
        for performance has changed for the better in response to regulatory
        activities. Most graphs illustrating the level of competence of a group
        of practitioners will show there are two opposing &quot;tails&quot; on
        either side of a bell-shaped curve plotting the number of practitioners
        versus the competence of each individual practitioner. The vast majority
        of practitioners will fall within the large body of the curve, near the
        mean and just barely below or above either side of it. The least
        competent practitioners will be represented in the low &quot;tail,&quot;
        and the most competent practitioners will be represented in the high
        &quot;tail&quot; of the curve.</p>
        <p>There are two types of regulatory actions that can significantly
        increase the mean for the group, thus showing an improvement in quality
        for the group. The first action is &quot;culling.&quot; The elimination
        of truly incompetent practitioners from a group will raise *89 the mean
        of the competency for the group. Slicing off the lower &quot;tail&quot;
        of the curve shifts the curve in a positive direction, thus elevating
        the mean of competence for the group. This is the traditional role of
        the health care regulator. The second action, an alternative to the
        traditional enforcement function, is really an array of activities which
        emphasize removing systematic threats to quality and introducing
        systematic incentives to quality. Regulation geared toward those
        practitioners at or near the mean, and those at the higher
        &quot;tail&quot; of the curve can also shift the curve in a positive
        direction, just as can culling. These actions have a greater potential
        to improve the overall competence of the group, because there are far
        more individual practitioners near or above the mean than there are
        practitioners well below the mean. Yet, despite its potential for
        success, apple &quot;polishing&quot; has not be used by regulators
        nearly as frequently as has apple &quot;picking.&quot; New theories of
        regulation suggest that cautious culling is necessary but far from
        sufficient to meet the regulatory challenge of public health protection.</p>
        <p>Troyen Brennan and Donald Berwick have described a plan for the
        implementation of responsive regulation to enable success rather than
        punish failure. In their landmark book, New Rules: Regulation, Markets,
        and the Quality of American Health Care, Brennan and Berwick propose a
        systematic approach to health care regulation, based on the principles
        of Continuous Quality Improvement (&quot;CQI&quot;). Their plan for
        responsive regulation encourages risk-taking as long as risks are
        monitored and controlled. They suggest that safe harbors from regulation
        should be carved out for major innovation, and that successful
        innovation should be rapidly spread throughout the health care system
        through the use of regulatory incentives. They contend it is
        anachronistic to regulate fragments in an era when the primary goal is
        to reconnect the parts into a whole.</p>
        <p>In a similar way, the much-publicized report of the Institute of
        Medicine, To Err is Human, describes an unhealthy United States health
        care system. The report suggests regulation can play a more significant
        role in public health protection, and that problems with medication use
        are among the most significant threats to quality in health care. The
        report concludes that almost *90 all accidents in health care result
        from human error, and these errors are usually induced by faulty systems
        that &quot;set people up&quot; to fail. In order to learn from error,
        health care regulators should require health care organizations to
        establish and maintain environments and systems for analyzing accidents
        and errors, so that redesign of processes is informed and productive.</p>
        <p>B. Pharmacy Systems and the Internet</p>
        <p>The absence of explicit design, lack of shared goals, and the failure
        to use empirical evidence to correlate inputs with outputs, make it
        difficult to refer to medication use in the United States as a
        &quot;system.&quot; Non-systematic medication use by physicians,
        pharmacists, and patients stands in stark contrast with the highly
        systematic drug development, production, and distribution by
        pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is the lack of a system that poses the
        greatest threat to quality in medication use, and the potential of the
        Internet to provide the framework of a medication use system is the
        greatest opportunity for responsive regulation of Internet pharmacy.</p>
        <p>During new drug development, decisions about the safety and efficacy
        of recently discovered molecules are made based on randomized,
        controlled clinical trials that are evidence-based and protocol-driven.
        Once approved for human use, the production and distribution of
        pharmaceuticals is restricted by a requirement for adherence to current
        Good Manufacturing Practices (&quot;cGMP&quot;). CGMPs mandate
        documentation, monitoring, and remediation when goals have not been met.
        The value of this highly organized system early in the drug therapy
        chain may be virtually nullified by the non-systematic last links of the
        drug therapy chain, when actual medication use is based on unguided,
        (and largely unevaluated) professional judgment, along with misplaced
        faith that patients use their medications appropriately and are
        satisfied with the results of their drug therapy.</p>
        <p>*91 Problems associated with drug therapy have been widely attributed
        to a need to re-engineer the system of medication use. With pharmacists
        as the focal point of system change, federal regulatory requirements
        have been initiated for Drug Regimen Review in nursing homes, and for a
        comprehensive program of Drug Use Review aimed at outpatient pharmacy
        settings. Courts of law have begun to recognize that pharmacists have a
        legal duty to evaluate drug therapy for every patient, and that
        technical accuracy in order processing is necessary but not sufficient
        to meet pharmacist professional responsibilities. State boards of
        pharmacy have begun to shift their regulation from structure and process
        only, to an emphasis on outcomes that are linked to structure and
        process. Mandatory CQI, as a component of administrative regulation of
        pharmacies, has been adopted by several states. The pharmacy profession
        is emerging from its isolation on the street corners of the community
        and the basements of hospitals to accept responsibility for
        systematizing medication use. A key component, that is lacking in
        traditional medication use, is a means to facilitate communication among
        those who participate in medication use.</p>
        <p>The Internet has the potential to be a key means of communication
        within a more systematic approach to drug therapy management. Two of the
        critical challenges to finding a solution to the problem of
        inappropriate medication use are the inaccessibility *92 of information
        describing the ideal for appropriate medication use and the deficiency
        of data defining the problems experienced in actual medication use.
        Through the Internet, physicians, pharmacists, and patients can access
        criteria and standards for medication use, and they can develop
        strategies for improving therapy to reflect evidence-based,
        consensus-developed, clinical practice guidelines. The Internet can host
        real-time threaded discussions about therapy; some of which can be open
        to all Internet users, others of which can be password protected for
        access only by health care providers. Patients can report their
        symptoms, progress, and satisfaction with therapy on the Internet.</p>
        <p>For example, assume that a patient who has been diagnosed with atrial
        fibrillation is treated with digoxin or another similar drug. The
        patient is not prescribed an anticoagulant. Data from drug studies with
        many patients indicate that of patients diagnosed with atrial
        fibrillation, approximately 70% should be treated with an anticoagulant.
        However, data also show that only approximately 40% of the atrial
        fibrillation patients for whom anticoagulation therapy is indicated
        actually receive this beneficial therapy. By answering questions
        presented over the Internet, patients for whom the therapy is indicated
        but who are not receiving it can be identified and evaluated for
        anticoagulation therapy. This evaluation can be facilitated by online
        access to clinical practice guidelines. The questions asked of patients
        can be prompted by the dispensing of digoxin, a marker drug for atrial
        fibrillation. Once begun, anticoagulation therapy requires close
        monitoring. The results of laboratory tests and other observations by
        the patient can be reported on the Internet, and care providers can
        review this information to assure that standards for anticoagulation
        therapy are being met.</p>
        <p>Not only can a health care provider use the Internet for the benefit
        of individual patients, aggregated data can be uploaded (with
        appropriate protection of patient confidentiality) to a central *93
        location for analysis and use in generating new guidelines. For example,
        experience with the use of anticoagulants by patients who have been
        diagnosed with atrial fibrillation can be reported to regulators and
        other reviewers for use as a performance database in the evaluation of a
        medication use system. These are not advantages that affect only the
        relatively few obvious beneficiaries in remote rural communities without
        adequate health care services, they are benefits for all users of
        medications, even those being treated at the most sophisticated urban
        medical centers. By facilitating communication from standards-setting
        groups, through health care professionals, to patients; and back from
        patients, through health care professionals, to standards-setting
        groups, a comprehensive program of medication use can be designed, with
        measurable goals and with correlated inputs and outputs. The Internet
        can be the tool through which medication use becomes a system.</p>
        <p>The pharmacy is a logical focal point for an Internet-based
        medication use system. Every pharmacy has a computer, unlike other
        practice sites that may or may not be computerized, and Internet-access
        is readily available in pharmacies. Formal alliances between
        brick-and-mortar pharmacies and Internet pharmacies have been
        established so that seamless provision of pharmaceutical products and
        services between local and remote practice sites is possible. Patients,
        their caregivers, and health care providers can all log in to the
        pharmacy Internet site to share information. Patients do not always go
        to the same physician for all medical needs, but they usually go to the
        same pharmacy for their prescriptions. Thus, the pharmacy database is
        likely to be the most up-to-date record of a patient's medication use.
        When patients request refills of prescribed medications to continue
        therapy at times when a visit to the physician need not occur, valuable
        information about success or failure with drug therapy, and satisfaction
        with drug therapy, can be elicited if the appropriate questions are
        asked. Responses to these questions are valuable data that can be used
        to close the quality loop between the providers of care and the
        recipients of care. Individual *94 patient responses that signal a need
        for medical attention can be queued up for evaluation by a pharmacist
        and then for referral to the patient's physician if necessary.
        Aggregated responses that indicate a common problem with many patients
        can be referred to standards-setting organizations for review and
        possible modification of practice guidelines.</p>
        <p>III. Enabling Patient Responsibility for Drug Therapy</p>
        <p>The Internet does not increase the possibilities for pharmaceutical
        care; it increases the practicality of pharmaceutical care. Any
        health-related activity that can be done electronically over the
        Internet can also be done physically, within the traditional medication
        use non-system. But the burdensomeness of physically looking up practice
        guidelines or interviewing patients about outcomes from drug therapy
        makes it unlikely that these activities will consistently be done
        without facilitation by the Internet. Use of the Internet not only opens
        up possibilities for enhanced communication up and down the chain of
        medication use, it shifts the balance of power from providers of care to
        recipients of care. The Internet changes the perspective of which end is
        &quot;up&quot; in the chain of medication use.</p>
        <p>Other advances in technology have had significant effects on public
        participation in decisions about the use of products and services. The
        printing press made it possible to widely disseminate information, as
        did radio and television. Yet the information disseminated through these
        media is controlled by the provider. The active provider of information
        chooses what to communicate to the passive recipient of information. The
        telephone is qualitatively different, because it is interactive for
        information exchange, although the number of participants in telephonic
        communication by voice is limited. By way of contrast, Internet users
        are active, their communication is interactive, and the number of
        participants is almost limitless. Through the Internet, the recipient of
        information has the opportunity to select whatever source of information
        she or he chooses from hundreds of thousands of possibilities. Internet
        users can interact with each other, either on a real- time basis, or
        with only a *95 short delay. Recipients of information now control the
        message they receive, due to Internet access. The Internet shifts the
        power over information exchange from the provider of it to the recipient
        of it.</p>
        <p>A. Patient Autonomy and State Paternalism</p>
        <p>A regulatory focus on providers of products and services makes
        perfect sense when the providers control the dissemination of
        information about their products and services and when providers can be
        readily located for enforcement activities. However, since the Internet
        shifts the control of information from providers to recipients, and
        since Internet providers are difficult to locate, it makes better sense
        to focus regulation on the recipients of Internet-based products and
        services. When the products and services are pharmaceuticals, a shift in
        regulatory focus from health care providers to patients requires
        reconsideration of deeply held beliefs about public health protection
        and about the need for centralized decision making about risk.</p>
        <p>Within the traditional scheme of drug therapy regulation, most
        decisions about risk are made for patients, and not with patients. If a
        molecule has been discovered or synthesized, and there is evidence
        indicating that the molecule might be useful as a therapeutic agent,
        patients will nonetheless be denied the opportunity to use the molecule
        in their own therapy until years of testing and data analysis show the
        molecule to be relatively safe and effective for a population of users.
        Even after safety and efficacy issues have been satisfactorily addressed
        and a new drug is approved for human use, the new drug will likely be
        restricted to &quot;Rx Only&quot; status. Only if a state- licensed
        prescriber then gives permission will a patient be authorized to use
        this new drug. While informed consent is a cornerstone of medical care
        and of health care regulation, the concept is rarely applied to drug
        therapy, and empirical data suggest patients are largely uninvolved in
        the choice of their drug therapy. Physicians decide *96 what drugs
        patients will use, and they prescribe how the drugs will be used.
        Patients are given the choice of either following doctor's orders or
        developing their own medication use behavior at the risk of being
        labeled as &quot;noncompliant.&quot;</p>
        <p>Despite the emergence of a huge industry of alternative and/or
        complementary therapies that circumvent this costly and
        difficult-to-access traditional system, the appropriateness of state
        paternalism in drug therapy is seldom questioned. Drugs seem complex and
        mysterious. They are known to be both injury-reducing and
        injury-producing. It seems so sensible for government to protect
        citizens from the bad choices they might make in drug therapy, if given
        the opportunity to choose for themselves, even when only their own
        personal interests are at stake. The reality that adverse drug effects
        are rampant within the current paternalistic system of drug regulation
        is seldom considered by those who challenge the notion that autonomous
        individuals could make good drug therapy decisions for themselves if
        enabled to do so.</p>
        <p>In theory, restrictive regulation of drug therapy serves several
        useful purposes: (1) it prevents overuse of drugs on which patients
        could become dependent, (2) it improves therapeutic outcomes by assuring
        that patients receive therapy that will make them better and not worse,
        (3) it brings patients back to physician offices on a consistent basis,
        so that necessary examinations and tests can be routinely performed, (4)
        it protects the financial resources of people who might otherwise
        squander their assets on useless nostrums, and (5) it protects the
        community from self-serving behaviors (i.e., antibiotic overuse) that
        are of limited value to individuals and are harmful to the population.
        Each of these assertions is subject to challenge, particularly as *97
        applied to a relatively sophisticated group of individuals, such as
        those who use the Internet. It is not at all certain that users of
        Internet pharmacy would act against their own self interest, or against
        the interest of the community.</p>
        <p>In response to those who paint a dire picture of potential widespread
        tragedy resulting from anything other than consistently aggressive and
        occasionally repressive regulation of Internet pharmacy, it is perhaps
        equally as plausible to assert that Internet users who are enabled to
        make good drug therapy decisions for themselves would do so. Responsive
        regulation, as opposed to restrictive regulation, has the potential to
        increase the availability of valid drug-related information and to
        facilitate assistance with medical decisions made by patients through
        access to online treatment algorithms. Responsive Internet regulation
        could reduce health care costs and increase access to health care. This
        is not a claim that such benefits necessarily would result from
        responsive regulation of Internet pharmacy. The only way to know whether
        appropriately enabled Internet users could adequately protect themselves
        from harm caused by adverse drug effects and produce benefits from
        available therapies would be to compare outcomes in two populations:
        passive patients in the traditional system and active Internet users. In
        a sense, Internet pharmacy could be seen as an experiment in patient
        autonomy. This may be the time to find out whether technically
        sophisticated medication users really need government protection from
        themselves. This an opportunity for major innovation that should be
        taken seriously and empirically studied, as are other experiments. The
        question is not whether Internet pharmacy should be permitted; it is an
        unstoppable development that is certain to increase in popularity.
        Regulators should be asking how they can guide this inevitable
        technology through regulation that appropriately protects and promotes
        the public health.</p>
        <p>B. Defining Relationships in Drug Therapy</p>
        <p>The physician-patient relationship is one of the most highly
        respected bonds in our society. It is a covenental relationship of
        trust, which is based on an ideal of altruism and a reality of
        scientific *98 complexity. There are special legal rules of
        confidentiality, privilege, and duty that apply to this most important
        of non-familial relationships. The medical profession has established
        standards of practice that reflect questions not only of technical
        expertise within the care provider role but also fundamental questions
        of role for the care provider. It is considered beneath the standard of
        care for a physician to provide incompetent services or to provide
        competent services in an uncaring way. The &quot;what&quot; and the
        &quot;how&quot; of medical care both matter. Patients must feel
        comfortable in their relationship with their physician, or else they
        will come to distrust the health care system and refuse to participate
        in it--all to the detriment of individuals and the population.</p>
        <p>Threats to the physician-patient relationship have been seen in
        government oversight of the profession, as well as in corporate
        ownership of practice and in managed care. Interference with the
        physician-patient relationship has even been used as justification for
        restricting legal recognition of emerging expanded responsibilities of
        pharmacists for drug therapy management. Not unexpectedly, the Internet
        has been viewed with suspicion by the medical establishment, fearful
        that electronic communication could reduce the physician-patient
        relationship to a physician- patient interface.</p>
        <p>Within other contexts, the medical profession has struggled to define
        what activities of physicians comprise a satisfactory relationship with
        patients. For example, informed consent is now considered a necessary
        prerequisite to surgery, and the elements of a sufficient informed
        consent are generally well defined, although they remain somewhat
        controversial. But informed consent does not have a long history in
        medicine, and views persist among some physicians that patients are
        better off not being involved in complex medical decisions. Drug therapy
        presents different challenges for relationship definition because,
        unlike *99 surgery, there is no requirement that a &quot;touching&quot;
        occur for a physician to provide pharmaceutical treatment. The natural
        requirement for physical proximity in surgery need not logically lead to
        the human imposition of such a requirement in drug therapy. Physical
        proximity of physician and patient, of a type that will permit a
        hands-on examination prior to authorization to use any medication, seems
        unnecessary under all circumstances.</p>
        <p>When a physician knows a patient already, or when a patient is known
        to another physician within a practice, and documentation of impressions
        from earlier care is readily available in a patient care record, it is
        not always necessary for the patient to physically visit a physician.
        Forcing a patient who is physically incapacitated or who has significant
        transportation barriers to visit a physician to secure permission to
        continue treatment of a recurrent or chronic condition seems wasteful of
        resources and unnecessarily inconvenient. On the other hand, a
        physician's brief review of a checklist submitted by a patient hundreds
        or thousands of miles away clearly cannot create a new physician-patient
        relationship within the model for practice that the medical
        establishment has developed. The difficult challenge is knowing how much
        physician-patient contact is enough for safe and effective treatment,
        and how much is too burdensome for patients who will forego all
        treatment when barriers to access are overwhelming. The inevitable
        conclusion is that one- size-fits-all descriptions of activities that
        comprise a sufficient physician- patient relationship, from a medical
        perspective, will fail to accommodate individual patient differences and
        varied personal circumstances.</p>
        <p>The difficulty of using a medical model to define the character of a
        sufficient physician-patient relationship raises the possibility that
        other models might be more useful, including perhaps a patient-centered
        model. A sufficient physician-patient relationship might be one the
        patient believes to be sufficient, based on whatever criteria the
        patient chooses to apply. Deference to patients as the arbiters of the
        sufficiency of their relationship with physicians would require trusting
        patients to act responsibly on behalf of themselves and the community.
        Reliance on patients to make this determination could be based on
        respect for individual *100 autonomy, a basic principle of biomedical
        ethics. The market failure of information asymmetry, which is often
        cited to justify state paternalism in drug therapy, may not be a
        persuasive rationale when applied to patients who are able to use the
        Internet and have access to virtually limitless information. There is
        always the question of individual liberty and the challenge a free
        society must face in justifying any choice of the risks from which its
        members will be protected by government. It is difficult to understand
        why people can be allowed to eat snack foods with no nutritional value,
        participate in hazardous sporting events, and elect whomever they wish
        to govern them, but not be allowed to choose their own medicine. This
        observation is not intended to be an absolute claim that all patients
        could always appropriately define their relationship with a physician,
        but it is a suggestion that those who advocate strong regulation of
        Internet pharmacy in ways that perpetuate traditional physician- patient
        relationships should explain the basis of their advocacy. It may well be
        that harm resulting from a decision by a well-informed Internet user to
        acquire medication without medical authority should not be viewed as a
        regulatory failure.</p>
        <p>C. Operationalizing Patient Responsibility</p>
        <p>Conceptualizing and describing an ideal of informed and rational drug
        therapy choice by Internet pharmacy users is easier than is putting this
        laudable goal into practice. Responsible use of Internet pharmacy
        requires that users know the choices available to them and reflect on
        the consequences of their choices before they engage in potentially
        risky behaviors. Users of Internet pharmacies need to know significant
        therapeutic aspects of the medications they consider using. They also
        need to know the identity and qualifications of those from whom they
        acquire medications. If they choose to take risks with medications, or
        to acquire medications from unreliable or unidentified sources, then
        they must understand that protections ordinarily provided by regulatory
        agencies are being foregone.</p>
        <p>The only means yet developed to enable Internet pharmacy users to
        protect themselves from risks that are unacceptable to *101 them is the
        VIPPS program established and operated by NABP. VIPPS is a voluntary
        program. Internet pharmacy sites that opt for VIPPS certification must
        apply to the NABP. The application is reviewed by NABP to assure that
        the Internet pharmacy is in compliance with relevant state and federal
        laws. VIPPS pharmacies must also maintain a quality assurance or quality
        improvement program. They must report to NABP any changes of information
        provided as part of the initial certification process. Once issued,
        certification is renewable annually following an update of the
        registration information and re- verification of licensure status.</p>
        <p>VIPPS certified Internet pharmacies are granted authority to use the
        NABP/VIPPS hyperlink seal on their web sites. Visitors to the site may
        click on the seal to receive real-time verification that the site is
        certified. Any site that pirates the &quot;click to verify&quot; seal
        will soon discover the online, real-time verification process does not
        work for any site other than the certified site. &quot;Rogue&quot; sites
        are immediately exposed to the Internet user. Through the VIPPS program,
        Internet pharmacy users receive assurance that their certified provider
        has met exacting quality standards. They know who is providing their
        pharmaceutical products and services, and to whom to complain when
        things have not gone well. Although VIPPS is not a regulatory program,
        it provides assurance to Internet pharmacy users that certified sites
        are being overseen by pharmacy regulators.</p>
        <p>The most significant drawback of VIPPS is that it is not well known
        to Internet pharmacy users. Even the best program is of little value if
        those who would benefit from it do not know about it. Pharmacy
        regulators should feel comforted that they have made significant strides
        toward adequately protecting the public health by endorsing and
        participating in the VIPPS program. However, until public knowledge of
        VIPPS increases to the level of, for example, the Good Housekeeping Seal
        of Approval or the Consumer Reports product ratings, there will continue
        to be significant regulatory challenges to meet in Internet pharmacy.
        Fortunately, there is a readily available medium to use in getting the
        word out about VIPPS to Internet pharmacy users; that medium is the
        Internet itself. By requiring search engines to provide streaming
        cautionary statements to any Internet user who enters a search term that
        suggests the intent to *102 acquire prescription-only drugs over the
        Internet, the user who is uninformed about VIPPS has the opportunity to
        discover the protections this program provides. It might be possible to
        require this same streaming cautionary statement be displayed any time
        an Internet user enters a Uniform Resource Locator (&quot;URL&quot;)
        with similarly suggestive terms. The objective would not be to forbid
        use of the Internet, but to inform users that they may be going to a
        site where the presence or absence of the VIPPS seal would be a
        significant factor for them. Some Internet pharmacy users would continue
        to use sites not certified by the VIPPS program, but only after being
        informed of the VIPPS program and making a conscious choice to forego
        the protection it provides.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p>Traditional enforcement-oriented regulation will continue to have a
        role to play in government oversight of Internet pharmacy, when the
        pharmacy can be physically located, when resources necessary for
        enforcement are available, and when enforcement does not have a chilling
        effect on beneficial telehealth activities. However, it would seem
        sensible to steward scarce regulatory resources and devote them
        primarily to enforcement directed at those who distribute addictive
        controlled substances, or highly toxic drugs, to users who have ordered
        them over the Internet. Interfering with the acquisition of hair
        restoratives or drugs intended to enhance sexual function is an exercise
        of state paternalism that goes beyond what is necessary or expected
        under the circumstances. To be successful, any regulatory agency has to
        be credible with the public it serves, and the targeting of
        &quot;lifestyle&quot; drugs has the potential to adversely affect the
        credibility of pharmacy regulators. Mounting a taxpayer-funded crusade
        against bad choices that adversely affect nobody other than the person
        making the choice could have the appearance of economic protectionism,
        no matter how well intended as a public health measure.</p>
        <p>Regulation of Internet pharmacy to protect the public health will be
        most effective when it empowers Internet users to protect themselves
        from risks the users believe to be unacceptable. Promotion of the VIPPS
        program is the best assurance regulators can provide to the public that
        individual Internet pharmacy users are being protected by the
        professionalism that state-licensed pharmacists offer through their
        oversight of the medication *103 use process. Pharmaceutical care can be
        made more successful through Internet alliances within pharmacy; and
        between pharmacists, physicians and patients. In the end, this is simply
        a matter of trusting people to make good choices for themselves and
        providing them with the means to make their choices as good as they can
        be.</p>
