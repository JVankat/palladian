   Russia Today ( 12:09 )                                                    NAACP  vs  Rand Paul ( 5:22)</h6>
<p>Whether you love him or hate him, political newcomer Rand Paul, one of the very few politicians who is not financially beholden to any special interest groups, is energizing the voters.</p>
<p>Paul ( the son of former presidential candidate U.S. Rep. Ron Paul ) recently defeated Republican Trey Grayson in the party’s primary for U.S. Senate. Some political pundits had closely watched this race, as they considered it to be a harbinger of the tea party movement&#8217;s strength.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=10673873"><strong>explains</strong></a> why she recently endorsed Dr. Rand Paul as the Republican Senate nominee from Kentucky:</p>
<blockquote><p>..nobody&#8217;s ever going to find a perfect candidate. There are things that I don&#8217;t agree with Rand Paul and yet his domestic policies, for the most part, I do agree with. He wants limited government. He wants the feds to start taking their hands off states&#8217; issues</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>And I respect that and I&#8217;m proud to support him, again, never finding a perfect candidate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No doubt, he disagrees with me on a whole lot of issues, but &#8230; proud to support him and others whom I can believe in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Glen Ford, Executive Editor of <a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/?q=node/11789"><strong>Black Agenda Report (BAR)</strong></a> explains how &#8220;Rachel Maddow exposed the truth about Rand Paul&#8217;s racism and how the Tea Party movement’s hidden agenda is continued ‘white nationalism’:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was like pulling teeth, but Tea Party star Rand Paul finally blurted out his core, racist ideology in front of national TV cameras. Property rights trump Black rights, every time. &#8220;White supremacy is the connective link that holds the &#8216;Tea Party&#8217; together &#8211; that, and relentless media coverage</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>White people in the aggregate will try to preserve the essential elements of a White Man&#8217;s Country in perpetuity unless the state intervenes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Rand Paul, the Tea Party champion and winner of the Republican senatorial nomination from Kentucky, thinks business owners have the inalienable right to refuse service to Black people. It only took a few minutes for MSNBC&#8217;s liberal-minded Rachel Maddow to pry the truth out of Paul &#8211; to make him elocute his racist beliefs before a national audience.<br />
Ford explains how Rand Paul is “ now the &#8220;Mad Hatter&#8221; &#8211; for blurting out on Maddow&#8217;s show beliefs he and his Texas congressman father, Ron Paul, have always held, and which have served both men well in the white nationalist movement called the Tea Party.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/blackagendareport/20100526_gf_FoxAndPaul.mp3 ">Black Agenda Radio Commentary MP3 File</a></p>
<p>Many wondered why MSNBC&#8217;s Rachel Maddow had chosen the issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964"><strong>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 </strong></a>to form the basis of her recent ideological debate (concerning the proper relationship between government and private business and, federal government’s extent of control over state’s rights) with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul"><strong>Rand Paul</strong></a> .</p>
<p>Was she trying to ‘out’ Dr Paul, the Republican nominee, who recently won the Kentucky primary, as a ‘closet’ racist?</p>
<p>Was she, perhaps, afraid that Dr Paul would revoke the Civil Rights Act of 1964 if he ever got into power in spite of the fact that as of this date, Congress has no plans of ‘revisiting’ this piece of historic legislation.</p>
<p>In an effort to ‘set the record straight on this issue, the Kentucky primary winner issued the <a href=" http://www.randpaul2010.com/2010/05/rand-paul-sets-the-record-straight/"><strong>following</strong></a>statement to the press.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I believe we should work to end all racism in American society and staunchly defend the inherent rights of every person. I have clearly stated in prior interviews that I abhor racial discrimination and would have worked to end segregation. Even though this matter was settled when I was 2, and no serious people are seeking to revisit it except to score cheap political points, I unequivocally state that I will not support any efforts to repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let me be clear: I support the Civil Rights Act because I overwhelmingly agree with the intent of the legislation, which was to stop discrimination in the public sphere and halt the abhorrent practice of segregation and Jim Crow laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some viewers got the impression that Maddow was trying to persuade Paul as to the magnitude of the injustice of racial discrimination so that she can change his opinion on the issue.</p>
<p>Those who are familiar with the tenets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism"><strong>Libertarianism </strong></a>understand what Paul is saying. To paraphrase Paul: In his opinion, discrimination is unjust…grossly unjust however…the legislative effort employed to remedy discrimination (especially one particular title-out of 10-from the civil rights act of 1964) does not pass scrutiny when it comes constitutional adherence.</p>
<p>Paul clarified his one objection to the Civil Rights Law of 1964 during a recently-held <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/21/gop_senate_nominee_rand_paul_of"><strong><br />
Democracy Now interview</strong></a>. Paul explained his position as follows :</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s ten different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act, and nine out of ten deal with public institutions and I’m absolutely in favor of. One deals with private institutions. And had I been around, I would have tried to modify that. When you support nine out of ten things in a good piece of legislation, do you vote for it or against it? And I think sometimes those are difficult situations. I do defend and believe that government should not be involved with institutional racism or discrimination or segregation in schools, busing, all of those things. But had I been there, there would have been some discussion over one of the titles of the civil rights. If we want to harbor in on private businesses and their policies, then you have to have the discussion about, do you want to abridge the First Amendment, as well? “</p>
<p>American political journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cockburn"><strong>Alexander Cockburn</strong></a> is rather annoyed with regards to how the interview was conducted-by both of the participants. In a recent article in the muckraking newsletter <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/"><strong>Counterpunch </strong></a>( a biweekly publication widely respected for its critical coverage of both Democratic and Republican political leaders, foreign policy etc…) Cockburn wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Rand Paul hadn’t been so preoccupied with winding up for what he plainly thought was his knock-out punch, concerning Maddow’s posture on the right to bear arms in every restaurant in America from Joe’s Diner to Le Cirque, he could have turned the tables easily enough, just by saying that this ritual flourishing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act doesn’t have too much to do with what has happened to blacks since that glorious day, from an appalling school system, to blighted housing, constricted employment possibilities, shriveled share of the national income and most recently the greatest transfer in US history of money and assets from African Americans to rich white people by the mortgage speculators, given free rein by Democrats and Republicans</p></blockquote>
<p>After watching Maddow’s interview , Cockburn continues, CounterPunch&#8217;s co-editor Jeffrey St. Clair <a href=" http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn05212010.html"><strong>noted:</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Maddow and Paul agree on probably 90 per cent of the BIG issues confronting us, from ending the drug and Afghan war, to ending bail outs. But because of their own peculiar prejudices, his doctrinaire libertarian, hers PC progressive, neither of them can talk about anything other than a non-issue such as the Civil Rights Act of 19 &#8212; SIXTY-FOUR. It&#8217;s like a Dadaist play.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Scheer , a liberal, independent journalist wrote the following in an article he penned for <em>Truthdig</em> (a progressive web magazine containing articles written by people who are considered experts in their respective areas of interest) titled: <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/whos_afraid_of_rand_paul_20100518/"><strong><br />
”Who’s Afraid of Rand Paul?”.</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Count me as one lefty liberal who is not the least bit unhappy with the victory by Rand Paul in Kentucky’s Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. Not because it might make it easier for some Democratic Party hack to win in the general, but rather because he seems to be a principled libertarian in the mold of his father, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, and we need more of that impulse in the Congress. What’s wrong with cutting back big government that mostly exists to serve the interests of big corporations? Surely it would be better if that challenge came from populist progressives of the left, in the Bernie Sanders mold, but this is Kentucky we’re talking about.</p></blockquote>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People <a href="http://www.naacp.org/about/history/howbegan/index.htm"><strong>(NAACP)</strong></a> is not very happy with Rand Paul.</p>
<p>Recently, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the NAACP-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Jealous"> <strong>Benjamin Jealous </strong></a>challenged Mr Paul to a <a href="http://race.change.org/blog/view/what_rand_paul_needs_to_know_about_race_civil_rights_and_a_better_america"><strong>debate </strong></a>on the topic of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Paul says that he supports all efforts to fight government-sponsored discrimination. He has no quibble with the end of segregation in public schools, for example, or in public-sector hiring. His only dispute is with desegregation of the private sector — the local merchants and lunch-counter operators whose speech rights were apparently encroached on by an overzealous federal government. In Mr. Paul&#8217;s worldview, the free hand of the marketplace would have eventually forced most of those businesses to serve black folk anyway, because it was in their economic interest to do so.<br />
The problem is that it never quite worked that way. Even after Jim Crow laws were overturned, those business establishments that bucked the system and served an integrated clientele faced threats, coercion and violence from a ruling class — a group made up not merely of local thugs, but of fellow business owners and, far too often, the local police force itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This was the point of federal intervention in the first place. The states and municipalities on the front lines of the desegregation movements were themselves the most likely to be institutionally corrupted by the cancer of racism. A relatively more objective outside party — the federal government — would have to serve as a mediating force.<br />
Of course the story went far beyond potential corruption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the rest of this interesting editorial.</p>
<p>What it all boils down to is the fact that, IMO, libertarianism represents a ‘pure’ political ideology that politicians belonging to a variety of political parties- like to ‘borrow ‘ ideas from. </p>
<p>It is imperative that the citizens understand the different aspects of Libertarian thought so that &#8216;the baby is not thrown out with the bathwater&#8217; when it comes to dismissing too quickly something which may contain great value-provided that it is explained properly to the public.</p>
<p>Will Rand Paul’s recent nomination affect American political discourse?</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<p>As John F. Kennedy was fond of saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Rand Paul’s ideas may lead the nation closer to finding the ‘right’ answer.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE I<br />
June 7, 2010</strong></p>
<p>Rand Paul’s campaign has ‘opened a window’ into libertarianism and the author of the article discussed below is shining a light through that window&#8230;</p>
<p>Libertarians are too focused on individual liberty only as it relates to how much authority government exerts over individuals . What about corporations and the power they exert over individual rights? </p>
<p>The author of <a href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7854"><b> this intelligently written commentary </b></a><br />
discusses some of the  ‘serious intellectual deficiencies’ which are, in his opinion, inherent in doctrinaire libertarian philosophy .</p>
<p>How does individual liberty get affected by corporate wealth and power?</p>
<p>Are libertarians cutting off their noses to spite their faces?</p>
<p>Is Libertarian philosophy ignoring the value (if any) of government serving as a ‘checks and balances’ against too much corporate power over society?</p>
<p>The author, Ernest A. Canning, explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Libertarians fail to appreciate that, especially in the 21st Century, the removal of government as a check against unfettered corporate wealth and power leads to  the tyranny of a corporate controlled economy”.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“The ‘Public/private distinction for civil rights enforcement ignores the omnipotent power of private corporations; anti-government &#8216;Tea Party&#8217; rhetoric misses the real threat to liberty posed by unchecked corporate wealth and power&#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Lawyers understand that rights cannot be treated as absolutes; that the rights of one individual often conflict with those of another; that both our legislatures and courts are designed to engage in a balancing of those rights, which, if not fettered by the corruption of special interests, should strive to protect individual rights to the extent possible while enhancing the general welfare. An individual may have a right to inhale carcinogens in cigarette smoke but that does not mean that he or she has the right to expose others to those carcinogens by smoking in a crowded restaurant”</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://rebelreports.com/post/104594733/after-us-strikes-afghans-describe-tractor-trailers"><strong>latest info</strong></a> on what is happening in Afghanistan-from independent investigative journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Scahill"><strong>Jeremy Scahill:</strong></a></p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p><strong>After US Strikes, Afghans Describe &#8220;Tractor Trailers Full of Pieces of Human Bodies;&#8221; Meanwhile, Obama Readies 21,000 More Troops:</strong></p>
<p>As rage spreads in Afghanistan after US bombing that killed up to 130 people, <strong>unnamed Pentagon officials are spinning another cover-up.</strong> Defiant Obama moves ahead with troop increase.</p>
<p>According to Scahill&#8217;s sources, <strong>the Pentagon was seeking to blame the Taliban for “staging” the massacre to blame it on the US.</strong>”</p>
<p>A couple of days after this massacre,the House Appropriations Committee <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-05-07-voa49.cfm"><strong>approved-by voice vote-</strong></a> the 2009 Supplemental Bill funding ($94 billion) ongoing U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and supporting economic and other needs in Pakistan- without seeking a plan from the president for an exit strategy for the troops (including the 21,000 US force escalation) that will be stationed there.</p>
<p>What exactly is the ‘goal’ to be achieved through the ‘war’ in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Is the ‘war’ meant to be won or is it meant to be continuous &#8211; a ‘perpetual war’ if you will .</p>
<p>If the ‘war’ is meant to be ‘won’ how will the US know if this ‘goal’ has been accomplished?</p>
<p>What is the exit strategy once the ‘goal’ is achieved?</p>
<p>Why the urgency to approve this funding through the use of a ‘vote now, ask questions later’ approach?</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that since a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_vote"><strong>&#8216;voice vote&#8217;</strong></a> was taken regarding the support for this bill, there is no written record of how individual members of the House Appropriations Committee voted on this issue. So much for government accountability&#8230;</p>
<p>While conducting research into the increased US troop surge in Afghanistan, I was surprised to learn the extent of Chinese investment in Afghanistan. I discovered this information in the <a href="http://www.sananews.com.pk/english/2009/04/21/china-taking-keen-interests-in-afghanistan/"><strong>international media</strong></a>. Our US mainstream media has provided very little, if any, coverage on this important development that had taken place over 18 months ago .</p>
<p>Excerpt:<br />
Beijing has an interest in a stable and secure Afghanistan as it provides a safe environment in which to exploit resources. In the short term, it seems China will free ride on the provision of security by NATO and Kabul. For instance, security for the Aynak mine is provided by the American and Afghan militaries.<br />
End of excerpt.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight now… U.S. troops are guarding a CHINESE enterprise that the CHINESE will benefit from in the future???</p>
<p>And now we find out how rich in natural resources Afghanistan REALLY is (including oil, copper, gemstones etc&#8230;). It appears that the world has known this fact since 1974 when Russia supposidly made this geological discovery during the time it was fighting in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>After Sept. 11 we were informed repeatedly that Afghanistan was dirt poor and had no natural resources, the implication being that going to war in Afghanistan was about freedom and democracy, not about stealing resources.</p>

THE EMERGING CHINA-AFGHANISTAN RELATIONSHIP</strong></a><br />
Excerpt:<br />
&#8220;Some eyebrows were therefore raised when in 2007, China’s Metallurgical group launched a $3.5 billion bid and won the tender to develop Afghanistan’s Aynak copper field in Logar province. The copper field is estimated to be the <strong>largest undeveloped field in the world and has been virtually untouched since the Soviet invasion in 1979. The investment is the far largest in Afghanistan’s history and involves not only mining but also the construction of a $500 million electrical plant and a railway from Tajikistan to Pakistan to support exploration.</strong> The mine will be in full operation in around six years, lead to the employment of 10,000 Afghans, while $400 million of royalties will accrue the Afghan government yearly – more than half of the present yearly state budget.</p>
<p>Let us see how<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/170320"><strong><em>Newsweek</em></strong></a> is covering the China angle:</p>
<p>Excerpt:<br />
“Strategically, there are good reasons why China might want to play a role in Afghanistan, with which it shares a small, mountainous frontier. Beijing is battling its own Islamic extremists in the area, and it&#8217;s extremely concerned about escalating violence in Pakistan, a close ally. Back in the 1980s, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prodded nervous Chinese authorities to join up with American, Pakistani and Saudi intelligence agencies to launch an ambitious covert operation to train, fund and arm anti-Soviet Afghan freedom fighters, or mujahedin. In a classic strange-bedfellows arrangement, Chinese authorities provided light weapons and other assistance to joint anti-Russian efforts based in the Afghan-Pakistani border area.”</p>

<p>Interesting&#8230; not one word mentioned about the Aynak copper field deal.</p>
<p><strong>Recap of Afghan History</strong></p>
<p>Source:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"><strong>wikipedia.org</strong></a></p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which connects South and Central Asia, and the Middle east- is a crossroads between the East and the West. During its long history, the land has seen various invaders and conquerors.</p>
<p>In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game"><strong>“The Great Game”</strong></a> played between the British Indian Empire and the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>On August 19, 1919, following the third Anglo-Afghan war, the country regained full independence from the United Kingdom over its foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Since the late 1970s Afghanistan has suffered continuous and brutal civil war in addition to foreign interventions in the form of the 1979 Soviet invasion and the recent 2001 U.S.-led invasion that toppled the Taliban government.</p>
<p><strong>In late 2001 the United Nations Security Council authorized the creation of an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). This force is composed of NATO troops that are involved in assisting the government of President Hamid Karzai in establishing the writ of law as well as rebuilding key infrastructures in the nation.</strong> In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In the meantime, multi-billion US dollars have also been provided by the international community for the reconstruction of the country.”</p>
<p>End of excerpts.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"><strong>Noam Chomsky</strong></a> recently sat down with Amy Goodman for a <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/4/3/noam"><strong>Democracy Now!</strong></a> interview in which he discussed, among other things, the US Expansion of Afghan Occupation, and the Uses of NATO (5:56).</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="190" height="172" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="never" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EZp9pDoQdwc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="190" height="172" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EZp9pDoQdwc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="never"></embed></object></p>
<p>Chomsky explains how the original purpose of NATO was to protect the west against a Russian assault. In 1989 the Berlin Wall fell and Germany became unified.The Soviet Union began its collapse.</p>
<p>Chomsky questions what is the NEW purpose of NATO?</p>
<p>He explains how NATO is essentially run by the United States and what happens in Afghanistan is heavily influenced by NATO actions.</p>
<p>Most of the 70,000 troops in Afghanistan are under NATO command. President Obama wants to escalate the war. He has sent 21,000 extra US troops to Afghanistan and is considering deploying 10,000 more.</p>
<p>Chomsky also discusses the growing peace movement by Afghan citizens and Afghan President Karzai’s early attempts to convince President Obama to stop killing Afghans.<br />
In his efforts to promote stability in Afghanistan, Karzai approached a UN delegation in an attempt to obtain a timetable for the removal of foreign forces. Karzai even had the <a href="http://lite.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/ISL415314.htm"><strong>nerve</strong></a> to entertain the thought of inviting the head of the Taliban to engage in discussions to work out a solution to what is going on in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Since these ‘escapades’, according to Chomsky, Karzai’s popularity in the eyes of the Western press has plummeted. Now he is being labeled as being weak and corrupt by the Western press.<br />
Learn why this is so.</p>
<p>Is Karzai being led ‘up and out’ because the US will seek a more loyal surrogate to run Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Chomsky seems to think that Karzai-who will most likely win the next election (scheduled to take place in August 2009)- will be placed in a ‘symbolic position’ with no real power to implement any changes in his country .</p>
<p>There are some US groups who support the surge in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Soltz"><strong>Jon Soltz</strong></a> is co-founder of <a href="http://vetvoice.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=14"><strong>VoteVets.org,</strong></a> and served as a Captain in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

<p>“For those of us who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was extremely important that the new president get the situation in Afghanistan right. Not just for America&#8217;s security, but for those troops still in Afghanistan, and those heading to Afghanistan to put their lives on the line in the war.

December 2, 2009</strong></p>
<p>President Obama, following his <em><strong>agonizing decision</strong></em> as to how to handle the Afghanistan situation, announced in his much anticipated speech Tuesday evening that he was sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan with plans to start withdrawing them in July 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/12/01/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5855894.shtml"><strong>Text: President Obama&#8217;s Afghanistan Speech</strong></a></p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<div><em>Good evening. To the United States Corps of Cadets, to the men and women of our Armed Services, and to my fellow Americans: I want to speak to you tonight about our effort in Afghanistan &#8212; the nature of our commitment there, the scope of our interests, and the strategy that my administration will pursue to bring this war to a successful conclusion. It&#8217;s an extraordinary honor for me to do so here at West Point &#8212; where so many men and women have prepared to stand up for our security, and to represent what is finest about our country.</em></div>
<div><em>To address these important issues, <strong>it&#8217;s important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place.</strong></em></div>
<div><em>We did not ask for this fight. On September 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives of innocent men, women, and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it not for the heroic actions of passengers onboard one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more.</em></div>

November 8, 2009</strong></p>
<p>The Army is facing a challenge with regards to finding &#8216;deployable troops&#8217; to send to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>As a result, many soldiers who have already been ‘shattered&#8217; by their experiences in our war zones are being sent to Afghanistan to serve our country&#8230;again.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175136/jamail_and_lazare_who_will_be_sent_to_afghanistan_"><strong>“Where Will They Get the Troops? Preparing Undeployables for the Afghan Front”</strong></a> written by Dahr Jamail and Susan Lazare &#8211; in the latest edition of <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/p/about_tom"><strong>TomDispatch.com.</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from the article’s introduction written by Tom Engelhardt, creator and manager of the Tomdispatch.com website:</p>
<div><em>”In a grim November 3rd Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125720469173424023.html"><strong>piece</strong></a> (buried inside the paper), Yochi Dreazen reported record suicide rates for a stressed-out U.S. Army. Sixteen soldiers killed themselves in October alone, 134 so far this year, essentially ensuring that last year&#8217;s &#8220;record&#8221; of 140 suicides will be broken. This represents a startling 37% jump in suicides since 2006 and, for the first time, <strong>puts the suicide rate in the Army above that of the general U.S. population.</strong> &#8220;</em></div>
<div><em>&#8220;After eight years of two major counterinsurgency wars (and various minor encounters in what used to be called the Global War on Terror), with many soldiers experiencing multiple tours of duty, with approximately 120,000 U.S. troops still in Iraq and almost 70,000 in Afghanistan, with the Afghan War clearly in an escalatory phase, commanders in the field calling for 40,000- 80,000 more American troops, and base construction on the rise, the military&#8217;s internal problems are clearly escalating as well.&#8221;</em></div>
<div><em>“We are, in fact, facing an ongoing disaster not just for the U.S., but for the U.S. military.<br />
Read the following piece and ask yourself: What state would a military have to be in to consider sending such men back into a war zone?&#8221;</em></div>
<div><em>&#8220;A desperate military is, of course, the answer &#8212; a military rubbed raw and, as the shocking mass murder spree at already stressed-out Fort Hood may indicate, on edge in a way that perhaps no one has quite grasped. “</em></div>

<p>Excerpts:</p>
<div><em>”Perhaps the most depressing aspect of Thursday’s shoot-out at Fort Hood is that <strong>none of the * 12 people who died in the melee will be counted as casualties of the wars</strong> in Iraq and Afghanistan. These soldiers – “brave Americans,” President Obama called them – will join an unknown number of American soldiers, airmen, sailors and marines, who are not among the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/casualty.pdf"><strong>5,267</strong></a> the Defense Department counts as having died in our most recent wars, but who have perished nonetheless.”</em></div>
<div><em><strong>“It will take days or weeks to learn what really happened at Fort Hood and why,</strong> but even at this early moment, we can make one statement for certain. The government’s refusal to accurately count their sacrifice of these young men and women dishonors not only these soldiers’ memories, but also obscures the public’s understanding of the amount of sacrifice required to continue wars in two countries, simultaneously, overseas.”</em></div>

<div><em>Note: Astute readers will note a discrepancy in the casualty numbers quoted in the two articles. This is due to the fact that Bernd Debusmann’s Reuter article was printed on September 10, 2009. Glantz’s New American Media article is more recent and as a result, the number of casualties listed (5,267) in Glantz’s piece is more accurate.</em></div>
<div><em>Excerpts from the Reuter’s article:</em></div>
<div><em>”By most counts, the death toll of U.S. soldiers in America&#8217;s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan stood at 5,157 in the second week of September. Add at least <strong>1,360 private contractors</strong> working for the U.S. and the number tops <strong>6,500</strong>.”</em></div>
<p><em>“Contractor deaths and injuries <strong>(around 30,000 so far)</strong> are rarely reported but they highlight the United States&#8217; steadily growing dependence on private enterprise.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a dependence some say has slid into incurable addiction. <strong>Contractor ranks in Iraq and Afghanistan have swollen to just under a quarter million</strong>. They outnumber U.S. troops in Afghanistan and they almost match uniformed soldiers in Iraq.”</p>

<p>What do you know about the colossal building project that is presently being built by the Obama administration in Islamabad Pakistan?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175135"><strong>2014 or Bust-The Pentagon&#8217;s Building Boom in Afghanistan Indicates a Long War Ahead”</strong></a><br />
By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complex:_How_the_Military_Invades_Our_Everyday_Lives"><strong>Nick Turse</strong></a></p>
<p>The headline says it all…</p>
<p>Excerpts:<br />
“While Washington has put modest funding into civilian projects in Afghanistan this year &#8212; ranging from small-scale power plants to &#8220;public latrines&#8221; to a meat market &#8212; the real construction boom is military in nature.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has been funneling stimulus-sized sums of money to defense contractors to markedly boost its military infrastructure in that country.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2009, for example, the <strong>civilian U.S. Agency for International Development awarded $20 million in contracts for work in Afghanistan, while the U.S. Army alone awarded $2.2 billion &#8212; $834 million of it for construction projects.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, according to Walter Pincus of the Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/17/AR2009101701695.html"><strong>(“Military Seeks $1.3 Billion For Projects in Afghanistan”)</strong></a> the Pentagon has spent &#8220;roughly $2.7 billion on construction over the past three fiscal years&#8221; in that country and, &#8220;if its request is approved as part of the fiscal 2010 defense appropriations bill, it would spend another $1.3 billion on more than 100 projects at 40 sites across the country, according to a Senate report on the legislation.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>In the news today- Afghan elections and U.S/Indo military training exercises…</strong></p>
<p>Karzai challenger resigns from Nov. 7 Afghan runoff election citing that the potential is very high for massive voter fraud.</p>
<p>Follow the story <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/asia/july-dec09/afghan_11-01.html"><strong>here on pbs.org website</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>“Afghan President Hamid Karzai&#8217;s main election challenger said Sunday that he will withdraw from a planned Nov. 7 runoff, casting new doubts on the legitimacy of the Afghan government as the Obama administration debates U.S. strategy in the region.”</p>
<p>“Former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah told a news conference in Kabul that he made his decision to pull out of the runoff after Karzai turned down his demands for changes to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and other measures that he said would prevent massive fraud, the Associated Press reported.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not participate in the Nov. 7 election,&#8221; Abdullah said, because a &#8220;transparent election is not possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The move may effectively hand a new term to Karzai, although the next steps for the runoff vote appeared clouded in uncertainty. It is technically too late for any candidate to formally withdraw from the ballot.”</p>

<div><em>New Delhi, Oct. 29: An Indo-US wargame that ended today in Uttar Pradesh helped retrain part of an American contingent that went into action in Iraq and will be redeployed in the war-ravaged country, scaling up the bilateral exercise that was originally projected as a peace-keeping drill.</em></div>
<div><em><strong>Exercise Yudh Abhyas 09</strong> – the latest in a series of Indo-US drills that began in 2004 – involved the largest deployment of ground forces by the two countries for joint training. When the exercise began, the Indian Army officially stated that the scenario for the drill was that of joint operations for peace keeping under a United Nations’ mandate.</em></div>
<div><em>It was more or less expected that the US Army will begin using Indian military facilities and experience to train for operations in Iraq and <strong>Afghanistan</strong> with the wargame.</em></div>
<div><em>But the <strong>scale of the drill was far deeper than initially thought</strong>. Within the first five days of the two-week drill, it quickly morphed into an armoured and infantry exercise involving para-dropping and securing urban settlements simulating environments in Iraq and Afghanistan with live firing.</em></div>
<div><em><strong>The trend among US-led coalition forces to use Indian military facilities to train for “Operation Iraqi Freedom” and “Operation Enduring Freedom” (Afghanistan) began in September 2007. But the drills have never involved as many soldiers, so much hardware and such massive firepower.</strong></em></div>
<div><em>Just how seriously the Pentagon takes its exercises with the Indian military is indicated by the logistics that have gone into the Babina drill. It deployed 17 Strykers – the largest deployment of the multipurpose armoured vehicles outside Iraq and Afghanistan – that were shipped all the way from Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, where the unit is currently based, to Mumbai.</em></div>
<div><em><strong>The Strykers and the US troops will now head back the same way for more training in the Mojave Desert in Southern California.</strong></em></div>
<p><em>“This exercise (Yudh Abhyas 09) is a ramp-up in training, as the unit prepares for larger pre-deployment training exercises such as those at the <strong>National Training Facility in California</strong> ,” a US army statement said.</p>
<p><strong>But beyond the show of power and battlefield skills, there was also a pitch for arms sales to India.</strong></p>
<p>The Stryker vehicle itself was closely watched by the Indian forces. It can be configured for several tasks – offensive, reconnaissance, communications and evacuations apart from troop carrying.</p>
<p>A senior official of the Pentagon’s defence sales branch <strong>also escorted executives of defence companies Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to Babina for the exercise</strong>.</p>
<p>The sleek shoulder-fired Javelin hones into its target without having to be guided to it. It is made by Raytheon.”</p>
<p>End of excerpts.</p>
<p>For the record, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are both major private U.S. defense contractors. The companies are known for their ‘cozy’ relationships with the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S government departments and agencies.</p>
<p>These war games will allow Indian military officials to assess some of the American defense equipment being offered for sale to India.</p>
<p>In spite of the facts mentioned in <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091030/jsp/frontpage/story_11676885.jsp"><strong>The Telegraph India article</strong></a> (posted further up on this thread) <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/2009/10/29/stories/2009102954531400.htm"><strong>according to this article in The Hindu</strong></a> Indian officials claim that India has no intentions of engaging in any military activities in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Just this week, the msm was all over the &#8216;news&#8217; that President Obama paid his respects to personnel killed in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-signing-national-defense-authorization-act-fiscal-year-2010"><strong>officially enacted</strong></a> the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first major federal civil rights law protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p>
<p>“What does this have to do with Afghanistan ” you ask?</p>
<p>Well, in case you missed it, the Hate Crimes bill, which was approved by the Democratically-controlled Congress last week, <strong>was attached as a rider</strong> to the<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/10/2009102821149315725.html"><strong><br />
$680-billion Defense Bill</strong></a> which includes $130 billion for ongoing military operations (war and occupation) in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Many people are happy that the Hate Crimes bill passed &#8211; however some people wonder what the <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20091026_war_is_a_hate_crime/"><strong>true cost</strong></a> for this bill’s passage will be.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from remarks made by President Obama on 10/28 during the signing of the National Defense Authorization Act (aka $680-billion Defense Bill) for Fiscal Year 2010:</p>
<p><em>“I have often said that meeting our greatest challenges would require not only <strong>changing</strong> policies in Washington but <strong>changing</strong> the way business is done in Washington; that it would require a government that&#8217;s more efficient and effective and less influenced by lobbyists and parochial politics. And I&#8217;m pleased to say that when it comes to the defense bill I&#8217;m about to sign into law, we&#8217;ve taken some important steps towards that goal.”</em></p>
<p>End of excerpt.</p>

<strong>Excerpts:</strong><br />
WASHINGTON (Reuters) –“ The U.S. Congress on Thursday sent President Barack Obama a $106 billion bill to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars after political sparring that could foreshadow tougher fights over Obama&#8217;s agenda.</p>
<p>The bill, delayed by disputes over quickly closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay and expanding support for the IMF, highlighted the difficulties Obama may face in Congress even though his fellow Democrats control both the Senate and House of Representatives.<br />
<strong>The bill contains $79.9 billion to continue fighting the two wars,</strong> $7.7 billion to address the H1N1 flu pandemic, and $1.4 billion in foreign aid for Pakistan, which is fighting Taliban militants spilling over the border from Afghanistan.”<br />
”The Senate voted 91-5, with most Republicans joining Democrats to support it. Obama is expected to sign it into law. The House approval on Tuesday garnered only five Republican votes and 32 Democrats voted against it.Democrats have a commanding majority in the House, but still need to keep centrist Democrats aboard and win a few Republican votes in the Senate to forestall any procedural roadblocks mounted by the opposition party.&#8221;</p>

”WASHINGTON – War-funding legislation survived a fierce partisan battle in the House on Tuesday, a major step in providing commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan the money they would need for military operations in the coming months.</p>
<p><em>The $106 billion measure, in addition to about $80 billion for military operations, provides for an array of other spending priorities, including $7.7 billion to respond to the flu pandemic and more than $10 billion in development and security aid for Pakistan and Iraq as well as countries such as Mexico and the nation of Georgia.</em></p>
<p><em>Democratic leaders pushing the bill on behalf of the Obama administration had to overcome an unusual alliance. <strong>Anti-war Democrats opposed continued war spending and Republicans condemned $5 billion in the measure to secure a $108 billion U.S. line of credit to the International Monetary Fund for loans to poor countries.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., unsuccessfully appealed to Republicans for support, saying 80 percent of the package still went to the troops. &#8220;Stand up for them,&#8221; he said.</strong></em></p>

<strong>Obama Has 250,000 &#8216;Contractors&#8217; Deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan and is Increasing the Use of Mercenaries</strong><br />

Excerpt:<br />
<em>According to new statistics released by the Pentagon, with Barack Obama as commander in chief, there has been a 23% increase in the number of “Private Security Contractors” working for the Department of Defense in Iraq in the second quarter of 2009 and a 29% increase in Afghanistan, which “correlates to the build up of forces” in the country. These numbers relate explicitly to DoD security contractors. Companies like Blackwater and its successor Triple Canopy work on State Department contracts and it is unclear if these contractors are included in the over-all statistics. <strong>This means, the number of individual “security” contractors could be quite higher, as could the scope of their expansion.</strong></em></p>

Here is an interesting <a href="http://www.economist.com/specialreports/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=13686470"><strong>‘Special Report’</strong></a> in the latest edition of The Economist.<br />
The article, titled <em>”The fragile web of foreign trade”</em> discusses the US/China trade relationship.<br />
Keep facts presented in this article in the back of your mind as you watch events play themselves out in Afghanistan.<br />
<strong>Excerpt:</strong><br />
<em>“A FEW years ago, Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick, two economic historians, coined the term “Chimerica” to describe the symbiosis between the world’s two great powers. Chinese people save, they observed, allowing Americans to borrow and spend more than they earn. American consumers buy gizmos made in China, keeping Chinese workers in jobs. Both countries benefit.</em><br />
<em>But the financial crisis has caused many people to rethink this comfortable arrangement.</em></p>
<div><em><strong>Protectionists have long blamed Chinese imports for destroying American jobs. A new gripe is that, by lending America so much money, China helped inflate the asset bubble that has now burst so painfully.</strong></em></div>
<div><em><br />
<strong>Although no one forced Americans to borrow so much, nor to gamble the money on property, the crisis has fuelled nativist anger. Lawmakers added “Buy American” clauses to this year’s stimulus package, and there are still absurdly tight limits on the number of skilled foreigners who can work in America.</strong></em></div>
<p><em>The American and Chinese economies are so entwined, however, that any attempt to separate them will end in calamity.”<br />

<p>How do you convince a well-read and informed person to engage in actions that go against his/her conscience?<br />
‘Ignorance is bliss’ for some- because too much knowledge can be dangerous.<br />
For others, ‘knowledge is power’.<br />
It is important to know which category we, as human beings, belong to.<br />
Read this thought-provoking <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=JAM20090526&amp;articleId=13745"><strong>article</strong></a> written by independent journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahr_Jamail"><strong>Dahr Jamail</strong></a> titled:<br />
Abandon the Battlefield. “There’s No Way I’m Going to Deploy to Afghanistan”<br />
Is Victor Agosto a coward? A traitor?<br />
<strong>Excerpts:</strong><br />
&#8220;It’s a matter of what I’m willing to live with,&#8221; Specialist Victor Agosto of the U.S. Army, who is refusing orders to deploy to Afghanistan, explained to IPS. &#8220;I’m not willing to participate in this occupation, knowing it is completely wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agosto, who returned from a 13-month deployment to Iraq in November 2007, is based at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas.</p>
<div>While in Iraq, Agosto never left his base, located in northern Iraq.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;I never had any traumatic experiences, never fired my weapon,&#8221; Agosto told IPS in a phone interview. &#8220;I mostly worked in information technology, working on computers and keeping the network functioning well. But it was in Iraq that I turned against the occupations. Through my reading, and watching what was going on, I started to feel very guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agosto added, &#8220;What I did there, I know I contributed to death and human suffering. It’s hard to quantify how much I caused, but I know I contributed to it.&#8221;<br />

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector"><strong>Conscientious objectors?</strong></a> No draft? What is a military leader to do?</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/133289/">this</a> article concerning the growing movement to add more mercenary troops in Afghanistan. This is being done for many reasons-including the fact that there is no military draft in the United States.</p>
<p>A mercenary is a ‘gun for hire’. Anything and everything can be ‘taken care of’ if the price is right. Laws do not necessarily always apply when it comes to prosecuting mercenaries for any illegal actions.</p>
<p>As you read this article, note the fact disclosed by the Associated Press that of the 3,847 security contractors operating in Afghanistan, many protecting our bases and convoys, only nine are U.S firms.<strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<p><em>“As President Barack Obama begins winding down the Bush war in Iraq, he is building up his own war farther east. “</em></p>
<h3><em>“The initial surge will add 17,000 troops to the 36,000 already there. Then, later this year, there is to be a second troop surge of another 17,000 or so.”</em></h3>
<h3>
<div><em>What Obama has not mentioned is that, in addition to soldiers and civilians, there is a <strong>third surge in his plan: private military contractors</strong>.</em></div>
</h3>
<p><em><br />
Yes, another privatized army, such as the one in Iraq. There, the Halliburtons, Blackwaters and other war profiteers ran rampant, shortchanging our troops, ripping off taxpayers, killing civilians and doing deep damage to America&#8217;s good name.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Already, there are <strong>71,000 private contractors operating in Afghanistan,</strong> and many more are preparing to deploy as Pentagon spending ramps up for Obama&#8217;s war. The military is now offering new contracts to security firms to provide armed employees (aka, mercenaries) to guard U.S. bases and convoys. &#8221;<br />

<strong>UPDATE V<br />
May 20, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/05/jones-imprudent.html"><strong>interesting tidbit</strong></a> that I ran across on George Stephenopoulos’ abcnews.com blog titled: “Jones: &#8216;Imprudent&#8217; to End U.S.Airstrikes in Afghanistan Despite Civilian Casualties”</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<div><em>“President Barack Obama&#8217;s national security adviser Gen. Jim Jones told me this morning that <strong>it would be &#8220;imprudent&#8221; to end U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan.</strong></em></div>
<p><em>During his visit to the U.S. this past week, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan demanded all U.S. airstrikes end. He said a recent airstrike may have killed as many as 130 civilians.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we&#8217;re going to take a look at trying to make sure that we correct those things we can correct, <strong>but certainly to tie the hands of our commanders and say we&#8217;re not going to conduct air strikes, it would be imprudent,&#8221;</strong> Jones said in his first television interview”</p>
<p></em><strong>End of excerpt</strong>.</p>
<p>Okay &#8230; noted. Now let&#8217;s move on.</p>
<p>I wonder if the General can explain to the public what he did&#8230;exactly&#8230; to earn the following money from Boeing and Chevron, and the US Chamber of Commerce last year?</p>
<p>Refer to this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123879462053487927.html#printMode"><strong>Wall Street Journal article</strong></a> titled “Hedge Fund Paid Summers $5.2 Million in Past Year“.</p>
<p>Read how at much money Jim Jones made last year- pay particular attention as to who paid him the money…</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong><br />
“National Security Adviser James Jones reported $900,000 in salary and bonus from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as director fees from a number of corporations. He received, for example, $330,000 from Boeing Corp. and $290,000 from Chevron Corp.”End of excerpt.</p>
<p>The General is key in shaping and carrying out the Obama administrations’ policy decisions as they relate to the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The information was released a few weeks ago as part of a financial disclosure that is required for federal office holders and top aides .</p>
<p>Is it just me…or does anyone else out there think that there is a possible conflict of interest here?</p>
<p>While you are at it, read the entire article to learn what some of the other important advisors to Pres. Obama made in earnings last year.</p>
<p>Here too- note who paid them the money.<br />
Again I ask- are there any possible conflicts of interest here?</p>

<p>Excerpt:<br />
<em>Jun 16, 2009: &#8220;After passing both the Senate and House, a conference committee is created to work out differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill. A conference report resolving those differences passed in the House of Representatives, paving the way for enactment of the bill, by roll call vote.

On Thursday, June 19 the SENATE passed the “CONFERENCE REPORT” too &#8211; which irons out differences between House &amp; Senate versions of H.R. 2346.</p>

<p>Here are excerpts from Jeromy Pelofsky’s Reuters article posted on 6/19.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<p><em>WASHINGTON (Reuters) –“ The U.S. Congress on Thursday sent President Barack Obama a $106 billion bill to pay for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars after political sparring that could foreshadow tougher fights over Obama&#8217;s agenda.</em></p>
<p><em>The bill, delayed by disputes over quickly closing the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay and expanding support for the IMF, highlighted the difficulties Obama may face in Congress even though his fellow Democrats control both the Senate and House of Representatives.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>The bill contains $79.9 billion to continue fighting the two wars,</strong> $7.7 billion to address the H1N1 flu pandemic, and $1.4 billion in foreign aid for Pakistan, which is fighting Taliban militants spilling over the border from Afghanistan.”</em><br />
 <br />
<em>”The Senate voted 91-5, with most Republicans joining Democrats to support it. Obama is expected to sign it into law. The House approval on Tuesday garnered only five Republican votes and 32 Democrats voted against it.</em></p>
<p><em>Democrats have a commanding majority in the House, but still need to keep centrist Democrats aboard and win a few Republican votes in the Senate to forestall any procedural roadblocks mounted by the opposition party.&#8221;</em></p>

<strong>Excerpts from Yahoo News:</strong><br />
<em>”WASHINGTON – War-funding legislation survived a fierce partisan battle in the House on Tuesday, a major step in providing commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan the money they would need for military operations in the coming months.<br />
The $106 billion measure, in addition to about $80 billion for military operations, provides for an array of other spending priorities, including $7.7 billion to respond to the flu pandemic and more than $10 billion in development and security aid for Pakistan and Iraq as well as countries such as Mexico and the nation of Georgia.</em><br />
<em>Democratic leaders pushing the bill on behalf of the Obama administration had to overcome an unusual alliance. <strong>Anti-war Democrats opposed continued war spending and Republicans condemned $5 billion in the measure to secure a $108 billion U.S. line of credit to the International Monetary Fund for loans to poor countries.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., unsuccessfully appealed to Republicans for support, saying 80 percent of the package still went to the troops. &#8220;Stand up for them,&#8221; he said.</strong></em><br />
 </p>
<div><em><br />
<strong>Rep. Howard &#8220;Buck&#8221; McKeon, R-Calif., top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, contended that Democrats were endangering troops by shifting money to create room for a &#8220;global bailout loan program.&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong>End of excerpts.</strong><br />
President Obama and the Democrats (who control both chambers) had to fight hard for the bill.<br />

<div><strong>Protectionists have long blamed Chinese imports for destroying American jobs. A new gripe is that, by lending America so much money, China helped inflate the asset bubble that has now burst so painfully.</strong></div>
<p><strong>Although no one forced Americans to borrow so much, nor to gamble the money on property, the crisis has fuelled nativist anger. Lawmakers added “Buy American” clauses to this year’s stimulus package, and there are still absurdly tight limits on the number of skilled foreigners who can work in America.</strong></p>
<p>The American and Chinese economies are so entwined, however, that any attempt to separate them will end in calamity.”<br />

<p>How do you convince a well-read and informed person to engage in actions that go against his/her conscience?</p>
<p>‘Ignorance is bliss’ for some- because too much knowledge can be dangerous.</p>
<p>For others, ‘knowledge is power’.</p>
<p>It is important to know which category we, as human beings, belong to.</p>
<p>Read this thought-provoking <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=JAM20090526&amp;articleId=13745"><strong>article</strong></a> written by independent journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahr_Jamail"><strong>Dahr Jamail</strong></a> titled: Abandon the Battlefield. “There’s No Way I’m Going to Deploy to Afghanistan”</p>
<p>Is Victor Agosto a coward? A traitor?</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;It’s a matter of what I’m willing to live with,&#8221; Specialist Victor Agosto of the U.S. Army, who is refusing orders to deploy to Afghanistan, explained to IPS. &#8220;I’m not willing to participate in this occupation, knowing it is completely wrong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Agosto, who returned from a 13-month deployment to Iraq in November 2007, is based at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas.</p>
<div><em>While in Iraq, Agosto never left his base, located in northern Iraq.</em></div>
<div><em><br />
&#8220;I never had any traumatic experiences, never fired my weapon,&#8221; Agosto told IPS in a phone interview. &#8220;I mostly worked in information technology, working on computers and keeping the network functioning well. But it was in Iraq that I turned against the occupations. Through my reading, and watching what was going on, I started to feel very guilty.&#8221;</em></div>
<p><em>Agosto added, &#8220;What I did there, I know I contributed to death and human suffering. It’s hard to quantify how much I caused, but I know I contributed to it.&#8221;<br />

<div>No draft?</div>
<div>What is a military leader to do?</div>
<p> <br />
Read <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/133289/">this</a> article concerning the growing movement to add more mercenary troops in Afghanistan. This is being done for many reasons-including the fact that there is no military draft in the United States.</p>
<p>A mercenary is a ‘gun for hire’. Anything and everything can be ‘taken care of’ if the price is right. Laws do not necessarily always apply when it comes to prosecuting mercenaries for any illegal actions.</p>
<p>As you read this article, note the fact disclosed by the Associated Press that of the 3,847 security contractors operating in Afghanistan, many protecting our bases and convoys, only nine are U.S firms.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong><br />
<em>“As President Barack Obama begins winding down the Bush war in Iraq, he is building up his own war farther east. “</em><br />
<em>“The initial surge will add 17,000 troops to the 36,000 already there. Then, later this year, there is to be a second troop surge of another 17,000 or so.”</em></p>
<p><em>What Obama has not mentioned is that, in addition to soldiers and civilians, there is a <strong>third surge in his plan: private military contractors</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Yes, another privatized army, such as the one in Iraq. There, the Halliburtons, Blackwaters and other war profiteers ran rampant, shortchanging our troops, ripping off taxpayers, killing civilians and doing deep damage to America&#8217;s good name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Already, there are <strong>71,000 private contractors operating in Afghanistan,</strong> and many more are preparing to deploy as Pentagon spending ramps up for Obama&#8217;s war. The military is now offering new contracts to security firms to provide armed employees (aka, mercenaries) to guard U.S. bases and convoys. &#8221;<br />

<strong>UPDATE V<br />
May 20, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2009/05/jones-imprudent.html"><strong>interesting tidbit</strong></a> that I ran across on George Stephenopoulos’ abcnews.com blog titled: “Jones: &#8216;Imprudent&#8217; to End U.S.Airstrikes in Afghanistan Despite Civilian Casualties”</p>
<p></em><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<p>“President Barack Obama&#8217;s national security adviser Gen. Jim Jones told me this morning that <strong>it would be &#8220;imprudent&#8221; to end U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan.</strong></p>
<p>During his visit to the U.S. this past week, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan demanded all U.S. airstrikes end. He said a recent airstrike may have killed as many as 130 civilians.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we&#8217;re going to take a look at trying to make sure that we correct those things we can correct, <strong>but certainly to tie the hands of our commanders and say we&#8217;re not going to conduct air strikes, it would be imprudent,&#8221;</strong> Jones said in his first television interview”</p>
<p><strong>End of excerpt</strong>.</p>
<p>Okay &#8230; noted. Now let&#8217;s move on.</p>
<p>I wonder if the General can explain to the public what he did&#8230;exactly&#8230; to earn the following money from Boeing and Chevron, and the US Chamber of Commerce last year?</p>
<p>Refer to this <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123879462053487927.html#printMode"><strong>Wall Street Journal article</strong></a> titled “Hedge Fund Paid Summers $5.2 Million in Past Year“.</p>
<p>Read how at much money Jim Jones made last year- pay particular attention as to who paid him the money…</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong><br />
“National Security Adviser James Jones reported $900,000 in salary and bonus from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as director fees from a number of corporations. He received, for example, $330,000 from Boeing Corp. and $290,000 from Chevron Corp.”End of excerpt.</p>
<p>The General is key in shaping and carrying out the Obama administrations’ policy decisions as they relate to the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The information was released a few weeks ago as part of a financial disclosure that is required for federal office holders and top aides .</p>
<p>Is it just me…or does anyone else out there think that there is a possible conflict of interest here?</p>
<p>While you are at it, read the entire article to learn what some of the other important advisors to Pres. Obama made in earnings last year.</p>
<p>Here too- note who paid them the money.<br />
Again I ask- are there any possible conflicts of interest here?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE I I l<br />
May 13, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Here is an informative and thought-provoking article in which the author, Pepe Escobar, claims that the</p>
<div><strong>wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are over pipeline routes and control of the distribution of oil in central Asia-</strong></div>
<div><strong>NOT TERRORISM.</strong></div>
<div><strong>The facts as he presents them are accurate.</strong></div>
<div><strong>You decide as to whether or not you agree with his thesis.</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/139983/"><strong>Pipeline-Istan: Everything You Need to Know About Oil, Gas, Russia, China, Iran, Afghanistan and Obama</strong></a></div>
<div><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/139983/"><strong>I suggest that readers frequently refer to the map included in his article so as to be able to follow along with the story.</strong></a></div>
<div><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/139983/"><strong>I find Escobar to be a well-informed and witty journalist however he does do a lot of “globetrotting“ in his presentation of important facts in his articles which support his thesis.</strong></a></div>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong><br />
Pepe Escobar was born in Brazil. He is a foreign correspondent who has been based in several major cities around the world during his career. He is the roving correspondent for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Times_Online"><strong>Asia Times Online</strong></a> and is analyst and correspondent for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_News_Network">The Real News Network.</a>. Escobar focuses on writing about ‘geopolitics’ for the layperson.</p>
<div><strong>He wrote and published the following article <a href="http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/CH30Df01.html"><strong>“Get Osama! Now! Or else &#8230;”</strong></a> two weeks before Sept. 11.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Since Sept.11 he has focused his energies on covering Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Iran, Iraq, and the wider middle east.</strong></div>
<p><strong>He is the author of several controversial books. (I am in the process of writing a book review on his latest work “Obama Does Globalistan” for SCVJournal and Amazon.com).</p>
<p></strong>Escobar is also affiliated with the new, Paris-based European Academy of Geopolitics.</p>
<p>Here is a ‘quick and dirty’ definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics"><strong>Geopolitics:</strong></a> the study of how the geography (defined as location, size, natural resources-for example) of a nation plays a role in its history. It is important for one to become familiar with the global application of this term inorder to try to make sense of what is happening on the international scene today.</p>

Posted on May 10, 2009 in Truthdig.com<br />
By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges"><strong>award-winning journalist Chris Hedges</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Excerpts</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We are morally no different from the psychopaths within the Taliban, who Afghans remember we empowered, funded and armed during the 10-year war with the Soviet Union. Acid thrown into a girl’s face or beheadings? Death delivered from the air or fields of shiny cluster bombs? This is the language of war. It is what we speak. It is what those we fight speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The American ground troops are midterm in a history that started roughly in 1984 and 1985 when the State Department decided to assist the Mujahedeen, the resistance fighters, through various programs and military aid. USAID, the humanitarian arm serving political and military purposes, was the seed for having a different kind of interaction with the Afghans,” she (<a href="http://doctorswithoutborders.org/events/exhibits/thephotographer/assets/files/Juliette-Fournot.pdf"><strong>Dr. Juliette Fournot</strong></a> ) told me. “The Afghans were very grateful to receive arms and military equipment from the Americans.”</p>
<p>“<strong>But the way USAID distributed its humanitarian assistance was very debatable</strong>,” she went on. “It still puzzles me. <strong>They gave most of it to the Islamic groups such as the Hezb-e Islami of [Gulbuddin] Hekmatyar. And I think it is possibly because they were more interested in the future stability of Pakistan rather than saving Afghanistan. Afghanistan was probably a good ground to hit and drain the blood from the Soviet Union. I did not see a plan to rebuild or bring peace to Afghanistan. It seemed that Afghanistan was a tool to weaken the Soviet Union</strong>. It was mostly left to the Pakistani intelligence services to decide what would be best and how to do it and how by doing so they could strengthen themselves.”</p>

<p>Joan Walsh, the editor-in-chief of <strong>Salon,com</strong> provided this insight <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/walsh/politics/2009/07/03/palin_resigns/?source=newsletter"><strong>in the following piece she wrote:</strong></a><br />
<em><strong>“In an angry, rambling press conference that will rival Gov. Mark Sanford&#8217;s as a stunning example of a bizarre public meltdown, Palin basically blamed her decision on her national critics, who she said were blocking her agenda and costing Alaska taxpayers money.”</strong></em></p>

<p>CNN Anderson Cooper (5:49)</p>
<p>What is it about Governor Palin’s decision that Anderson Cooper does not understand. Focus on 3:53 to 4:10. Is it just me…or does Anderson appear to be rambling?</p>
<p>Rumors claiming that Palin is resigning due to ongoing FBI investigations against her have been refuted by both her <a href="http://www.adn.com/palin/story/853746.html"><strong>attorney</strong></a> and an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-palin5-2009jul05,0,2556197,print.story"><strong>FBI spokesperson</strong></a>.<span style="color: #ff3333;"><strong><em>Note: Follow &#8216;FBI spokesperson&#8217; link-which contains latimes url address- <strong>AFTER</strong> you complete reading this entire SCV Journal post.

<ul>
<li>Some have said that Palin is resigning because she wants to cash in on her reputation by writing a book but she can’t do this while in office <a href="http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/793061.html"><strong>Palin signs deal for memoir to be published in 2010</strong></a>. This is not correct. Palin does not have to resign from office to be allowed to write her book.</li>
<li>Some people speculate that Palin may be preparing for a 2012 run for national office. Some of these individuals believe that perhaps America is ready for a new political party. They feel that the Democrat party is controlled by so-called far left anti-american radical organizations (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACORN"><strong>ACORN</strong></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU"><strong>ACLU</strong></a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_La_Raza"><strong>NCLR (LA RAZA)</strong></a> and that the Republican Party has forgotten it’s values and has equally sold out the American people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh I don&#8217;t know&#8230;and I could be wrong&#8230;however &#8211; It appears that both Democrats and Republicans may be scared of a Palin candidacy in 2012.</p>
<p>Palin and her Alaska government administration have accomplished much while in office however the public (in my opinion) hears very little of it.</p>
<p>Check out the Alaska state government website <a href="http://www.gov.state.ak.us/news.php?id=1950#"><strong>for project updates (listed under &#8216;Priorities&#8217; tab).</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/11/17/ap-turns-heads-devoting-reporters-palin-book-fact-check/"><strong>this Fox News web article.</strong></a></p>
<p>Does Sarah Palin have a valid criticism when she questions why 11 AP reporters have been assigned to fact check her book versus assigning some of the AP reporters to <em>“to &#8216;fact check&#8217; what&#8217;s going on with Sheik Mohammed&#8217;s trial, Pelosi&#8217;s health care takeover costs, Hasan&#8217;s associations”</em> ?</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Sarah Palin is no normal politician, and at the Associated Press, apparently &#8220;Going Rogue&#8221; is no normal book.When the former Republican vice presidential candidate and former Alaska governor wrote her autobiography, the AP found a copy before its release date and assigned 11 people to fact check all 432 pages.</em></p>
<p><em>The AP claims Palin misstated her record with regard to travel expenses and taxpayer-funded bailouts, using statements widely reported elsewhere. But it also speculated into Palin&#8217;s motives for writing &#8220;Going Rogue: An American Life,&#8221; stating as fact that the book &#8220;has all the characteristics of a pre-campaign manifesto.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Palin quickly hit back on a Facebook post titled &#8220;Really? Still Making Things Up?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Imagine that,&#8221; the post read. &#8220;11 AP reporters dedicating time and resources to tearing up the book, instead of using the time and resources to &#8216;fact check&#8217; what&#8217;s going on with Sheik Mohammed&#8217;s trial, Pelosi&#8217;s health care takeover costs, Hasan&#8217;s associations, etc. Amazing.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE I I I<br />
July 22, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Hmmm…This is interesting.</p>
<p>This article provides a nice overview of the growing US federal government resistance movement.</p>
<p>State legislators (including Alaska&#8217;s) are sending out the message loud and clear that they expect Congress to uphold the provisions of the US Constitution and US Supreme Court case law which limit the scope and exercise of federal government authority over the states.</p>
<p><strong>Palin to feds: Alaska is sovereign state<br />
Constitutional rights reasserted in growing resistance to Washington</strong></p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=104524"><strong>this latest article</strong></a> written by <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=59335"><strong>Chelsea Schilling</strong></a>, a reporter for <a href="http://www.wnd.com/"><strong>WorldNet Daily</strong></a> .</p>
<p>Excerpts:<br />
<em>”Gov. Sarah Palin has signed a joint resolution declaring Alaska&#8217;s sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution – and now <strong>36 other states have introduced similar resolutions as part of a growing resistance to the federal government.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Just weeks before she plans to step down from her position as Alaska governor, Palin signed House Joint Resolution 27, sponsored by state Rep. Mike Kelly on July 10, according to a Tenth Amendment Center report.</em></p>
<p><em>The resolution &#8220;claims sovereignty for the state under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States.</em></p>
<p><em>While seven states – Tennessee, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Alaska and Louisiana – have had both houses of their legislatures pass similar decrees, Alaska Gov. Palin and Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen are currently the only governors to have signed their states&#8217; sovereignty resolutions.</em></p>
<p><em>The resolutions all address the Tenth Amendment that says: &#8220;powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>End of excerpts.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to this growing movement which has been spearheaded by US State Legislators in an effort to protect their constitutional authority.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>For more information on this movement, refer to the Tenth Amendment Center website.<br />
According to its website, <a href="http://www.tenthamendmentcenter.com/about/"><strong>the Tenth Amendment Center</strong></a> <em>”works to preserve and protect Tenth Amendment freedoms through information and education. The center serves as a forum for the study and exploration of state and individual sovereignty issues, focusing primarily on the decentralization of federal government power.”</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/"><strong>Worldnet Daily</strong></a> is a daily web publication considered by many as having a conservative slant with regards to its presentation of news, facts and information. It was started in 1997 by Joseph and Elizabeth Farah. The site provides news (original articles published by staff members as well as news sourced from other publications),editorials, forums and polling information.</p>
<p>Although the mainstream media and others consider this publication as being controversial (a few of the articles published in the past were based on news items that were considered ‘speculative’ at the time), it is important <em>not to throw the baby out with the bathwater</em>.</p>
<p>There are many respected journalists and authors working for WND.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb for readers is to follow the journalists and writers whose credibility has been proven.</p>
<p>One should keep this in mind before choosing to ignore an article because it appears in a particular publication or news program.</p>
<p>I say this because there are many reputable, credible, highly credentialed journalists and authors who are being prevented from publishing their material in the mainstream press- for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p><strong>To stay well-informed in today&#8217;s media environment, it is important to be able to follow credible journalists, authors, broadcasters etc…no matter where they may be disseminating their information from.</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE I I<br />
July 7, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Alaska governor says the state has paid almost <a href="http://newsminer.com/news/2009/jul/07/palins-office-details-complaint-costs/"><strong>$ 2 million</strong></a> fighting ‘trumped up’ ethics complaints against her.</p>
<p>The Palin family has personally shelled out close to $500,000 in personal legal debts.</p>
<p>Was the goal of this smear campaign to <a href="http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDFlYWQ4MDQzODFkNTA4NDI5MzUzOTQ3ZjRmNDg1ZjE="><strong>bankrupt</strong></a> the Palin family?</p>
<p>Follow these three links to gain some insight as to who some of the players behind complaints and lawsuits against Gov. Palin are/were.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adn.com/palin/story/838912.html"><strong>Here</strong></a> is a list of the 18 complaints filed against Palin.</p>
<p>Learn how and why every single complaint (except one minor one which is still pending) against her has been <strong>DISMISSED OR THROWN OUT.</strong></p>

<p>This short series represents one of the <strong>most comprehensive treatments of this issue (Ethics complaints against Palin) that I have read to date.</strong></p>
<p>The author attempts to provide answers to the ‘Five W’s’ (who, what, where, when, why ) and even the “H” (how)- simple, direct questions which serve as the backbone of a good investigative piece.</p>
<p>The author&#8217;s opinions and conclusions (which are, of course, <strong>subjective</strong>) are included throughout the three part series..</p>
<p><strong>The facts however are objective and easily verifiable</strong> .</p>
<p>You decide if you agree with some of the opinions and conclusions.</p>

&#8216;Now, Sarah’s Folly&#8217; by Maureen Dowd</strong></a> .</p>
<p>Wow&#8230;what brought on this tirade against Palin in Dowd&#8217;s latest (July 5, 2009) <em>NY Times</em> Op-ed piece ?</p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Caribou Barbie is one nutty puppy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Usually we don’t find that exquisite <strong>battiness</strong> in our leaders until they’ve been battered by sordid scandals like Watergate (Nixon), gnawing problems like Vietnam (L.B.J.), or scary threats like biological terrorism (Cheney).&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;When Lyndon Johnson was president, some of his staff began to think of him as “a sick man,” as Bill Moyers told Arthur Schlesinger Jr. Moyers and his fellow Johnson aide Dick Goodwin even <strong>began reading up on mental illness — Bill on manic depression and Dick on paranoia.</strong>&#8220;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;And so it was, Todd Purdum learned, as he traveled Alaska reporting on Palin for Vanity Fair, that the <strong>governor’s erratic and egoistic behavior has been a source of concern for people there</strong>.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>End of excerpts.</p>
<p>Read the latest (website link follows below) written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Purdum"><strong>Dee Dee Myers&#8217; husband Todd Purdum</strong></a>.As readers may recall, Myers served as President Bill Clinton&#8217;s Press Secretary from 1993 to 1994.</p>
<p>Todd Purdum wrote this piece for the August 2009 edition of Vanity Fair titled <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/sarah-palin200908?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all"><strong>It Came from Wasilla</strong></a> .</p>

<p>This is how Purdum describes Palin in the article-I am not kidding.</p>
<p><em>Todd Purdum&#8230;I have a suggestion for you: <strong>TAKE AN ICE COLD SHOWER</strong> before you write your next article about Governor Palin.</em></p>

<p>Did you hear about the Tea Party tax protests being held throughout the nation?</p>
<p>One of the most well-attended took place a few weeks ago in Fullerton, CA. <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/came-brought-ken-2328216-others-john"><b>The Orange County Register</b></a> and <a href="http://www.sgvtribune.com/ci_11863799"><b>San Gabriel Valley Tribune</b></a> were two of the VERY few institutional media groups that covered the event in any depth.</p>
<p>All is not lost, however. Leave it to a blogger to provide the ‘blow-by-blow’ details. Here is one of the best blogger coverages that I could locate on this event <a href="http://orangejuiceblog.com/2009/03/kfis-john-kens-tax-revolt-live-broadcast-from-fullerton-ca/."><b>Orange Juice Blog</b></a> The photographs help tell the story well.</p>
<p>Although these anti-tax ‘Tea Party’ rallies are breaking out across the country, the L.A. Times didn’t even bother to send an intern to cover this event-although it took place very close to its headquarters. Read <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/readers/2009/03/covering-taxes.html"><b>why</b></a></p>
<p>The Fullerton Tea Party attendees (ranging in number from <b>8-15,000 citizens</b> -depending upon who you ask) are trying to get their legislators to understand that taxpayers are angry and want REAL change.</p>
<p>If you are one of the millions of people who depend solely on the mainstream media’s (MSM) print and broadcast giants for your news, then most likely you know little or nothing about this protest.</p>
<p>You are also most likely clueless about the growing trend of Tea Party Tax Protest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_crowd"><b>‘flash crowds’</b></a> spreading across the nation.</p>
<p>Since February 2009, at least 150 protests have been organized and/or staged in this movement born out of outrage and concern.</p>
<p>Evidently, the MSM believes that thousands of disgruntled taxpayers gathering throughout the USA to protest isn’t newsworthy.</p>
<p>Perhaps the MSM is concerned that if the media spreads the news of how middle class citizens are voicing their discontent, this will encourage others to stage similar acts of resistance of their own.</p>
<p><b>Background on The Tea Party Tax Protest Movement:</b></p>
<p>The mainstream media is –with few notable <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M0ZOMXPzQ0"><b>exceptions</b></a><br />
ignoring the coast to coast tax revolt movement taking place in this country.</p>
<p>There is much irony…and danger…in this development.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgb2riNvyWs&amp;feature=related"><b>people</b></a> are trying to dismiss the movement in a number of ways including defining it as a public relations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing"><b>astro-turfing</b></a> movement meant to give the impression that it has been organized on a grass roots level but in reality they say the Tea Party movement is well &#8211; financed and managed (more like the controversial<br />
<a href="http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=2703"><b>A.C.O.R.N</b></a> or <a href="http://www.moveon.org/"><b>Moveon.org.</b></a> organizations).</p>
<p>Some are attempting to paint the movement as a partisan effort organized by ultra conservatives.</p>
<p>This is only an attempt to marginalize the movement’s significance.</p>
<p>The US Tea Party Tax Protest movement is an important contemporary social phenomenon for a number of reasons including:</p>
<p>1- <b>Protestor characteristics:</b> diverse middle class citizens (race, ethnic background, age, political party membership)<br />
2- <b>Method of Organizing:</b> The digital age phenomenon of email, Twitter, cell phones, social networking facilitate the formation of ‘flash crowds’<br />
3- <b>Goals:</b> depending upon which state the protests are taking place in, citizens may be seeking any or all of these objectives involving the placement of constitutional or statutory constraints on a government&#8217;s (<b>local, state or federal-level</b>):<br />
a. expenditure levels (how much government spending is okay)<br />
b. revenue generation capabilities (taxes, borrowing and investing of public funds etc…)<br />
c. fiscal policy-making process-who decides a &amp; b (debate, approvals, what is role of the public etc…)</p>
<p><b>The Irony: The MSM and the Taxpayers are Both Protected by the First Amendment…provided that the MSM does its Job Properly….</b></p>
<p>The First Amendment contained in our Bill of Rights states that people have freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press. They have the right to gather in a peaceful way. They have the right to appeal to the Government if they feel something wrong is happening.</p>
<p>Freedom of the press is contained in the very First Amendment because of its importance in protecting our newly formed republic.</p>
<p>The press was hailed by our Founding Fathers as ‘The Fourth Estate’ in a system of checks and balances against potential governmental abuse of power and authority. As a result, we have the three branches of government plus the press-keeping each other ‘in check’ .</p>
<p>In addition, the MSM has a responsibility to the citizens to bring to the peoples’ attention information regarding significant news events. This information will help the citizens to make informed decisions including –decisions regarding how to remain free and self-governing and when/how to hold government accountable for its actions.</p>
<p>If the MSM chooses to focus on sensational stories instead of covering events that will impact the citizens, then both the press and the citizens are at great risk of losing their First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Therein lies the irony surrounding the MSM’s decision to make this huge movement into a <i>‘non-event’</i> by choosing not to cover it properly.</p>
<p><b>The Danger: Threat to Democracy Due to MSM Blowback</b></p>
<p>I realize that reporting capabilities do indeed come down to availability of resources however, why is the MSM choosing to allocate resources to cover the <i>Octomom</i> story at the expense of ignoring The Tea Party tax protest phenomenon?</p>
<p>Freedom of expression provides a framework in which the conflict <i>necessary</i> to the progress of a society can take place <i>without destroying</i> the society.</p>
<p>It is an essential mechanism for maintaining the balance between stability and change in a society.</p>
<p>What happens if the media chooses to ignore citizens’ protests?</p>
<p>How can civil discourse take place?</p>
<p>How can conflicts be resolved?</p>
<p>Are we witnessing the engineering of a massive protest movement that will have to turn to violence to capture the attention of the msm.</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Expect the MSM to yawn</p>
<p>Stay tuned. Get involved.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi has formed an opinion about the entire protest movement (and has resorted to name-calling and ridiculing participants) based upon the actions of a <b>few ‘animated’ protesters</b>?</p>
<p>Where did these few ‘animated protesters’ come from?</p>
<p>What about the rest of the hundreds of thousands of peaceful middle class Americans who are protesting the state of health insurance in the US?</p>
<p>Are they part of an astro-turf movement too?</p>
<p>Are they members of the NAZI party?</p>
<p>Is it possible that someone is ‘playing both ends against the middle”?</p>
<p>Are we seeing citizens being divided so they can be conquered?</p>
<p>Read the following two articles (see below) for yourselves and decide.</p>
<p>Article 1- Source: Huffington Post<br />
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/06/unions-to-take-on-conserv_n_252720.html"><br />
<b>Unions to take on Conservative Groups Town Hall</b></a></p>
<p>Excerpt:<br />
<i>”The nation&#8217;s largest federation of labor organizations has promised to directly engage with <b>boisterous conservative protesters</b> at Democratic town halls during the August recess. In a memo sent out on Thursday, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney outlined the blueprint for how the union conglomerate would step up recess activities on health care reform and other topics pertinent to the labor community. The document makes clear that Obama allies view the town hall forums as ground zero of the health care debate.”</i></p>
<p>Read the rest of this article that identifies &#8211; right at the start- the protesters as being<br />
BOISTEROUS <b>C O N S E RV A T I V E S</b> .</p>
<p>I could be wrong but from what I have seen and read (non msm sources) , it appears to me that the protesters (including many Tea Party Tax protesters) may just be average US citizens….members of the dirt poor, poor, middle class, rich socio-economic levels…</p>
<p>Article 2- Source: BusinessWeek<br />
Now, read the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/09_33/b4143034820260.htm"><b>following</b></a> Businessweek ( 8/6/09 edition) cover story titled: <b>The Health Insurers Have Already Won-<br />
How UnitedHealth and rival carriers, maneuvering behind the scenes in Washington, shaped health-care reform for their own benefit</b></p>
<p>Excerpt:<br />
<i>”As the health reform fight shifts this month from a vacationing Washington to congressional districts and local airwaves around the country, much more of the battle than most people realize is already over. The likely victors are insurance giants such as UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET), and WellPoint (WLP).</p>
<p><b>The carriers have succeeded in redefining the terms of the reform debate</b><br />
to such a degree that no matter what specifics emerge in the voluminous bill Congress may send to President Obama this fall, the insurance industry will emerge more profitable. Health reform could come with a $1 trillion price tag over the next decade, and it may complicate matters for some large employers.</p>
<p>But insurance CEOs ought to be smiling.”</i></p>
<p>Again, I ask…</p>
<p><i><b>Is it possible that someone is ‘playing both ends against the middle”?</p>
<p>Are we seeing citizens being divided so they can be conquered?</b></i></p>
<p><b>UPDATE X V I<br />
July 1, 2009</b></p>
<p>Thousands of Tea Party protests –organized by various groups around the country-are scheduled to take place <b>this Fourth of July weekend.</b></p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.reteaparty.com/teaparties"><b>here</b></a>, <a href="http://www.teapartyday.com/Locations.aspx"><b>here</b></a> , and ,<a href="http://www.thenational912coalition.net/"><b>here</b></a> for details on the various activities being planned.</p>
<p>Many Tea Party organizers were forced to cancel at the last moment when city officials got wind of the number of anticipated participants.</p>
<p>Check out what happened in Atlanta recently. Atlanta has the distinction of holding one of the largest ‘April 15’ tea party protests in the country (over 20,000 people participated in this event).</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of an article written in <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/06/july_4_atlanta_tea_party_cance.html"><b>The American Thinker-</b></a> a daily conservative website which is referenced frequently on The Rush Limbaugh Show as well as the New York Times, Le Monde, and The Guardian newspapers.</p>
<p><b>Excerpt:</b></p>
<p><i>With as many as 20,000 people in attendance, the Atlanta Tea Party on April 15 was one of the largest and most successful Tea Parties in the country. The Atlanta Tea Party on July 4, 2009 had been expected to be just as large. Unfortunately, plans have changed. Simon Property Group has forced the cancellation of the Atlanta Tea Party.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Tea Party was forced to cancel its Independence Day celebration in Gwinnett, after losing its location due to the objection of Gwinnett Place Mall (a Simon company.) The Tea Party had been scheduled to take place in the parking lot of the old Macy&#8217;s building at Gwinnett Place since March.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unfortunate the event had to be canceled,&#8221; said Julianne Thompson, event co-organizer. She continued, &#8220;The old Macy&#8217;s building is on private property, and not owned by Simon Malls, however the mall manager asked the property owner and I to come in the office on Thursday of this week [June 18], and told us Simon does not want political events on its property. They were also concerned about the fact we were using the term &#8216;protest.&#8217; Although the event was on private property, the mall was able to assert authority on the matter due to <a href="http://www.lacba.org/Files/LAL/Vol31No8/2531.pdf"><b>reciprocal property easement agreements</b></a>.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><b>UPDATE X V<br />
June 19, 2009</b></p>
<p>Perhaps this may help explain <b>just some</b> of the reasons as to why some people feel so strongly about supporting the Tea Party Tax Protest movement.</p>
<p>Perhaps this may also help to explain why the media <b>REFUSES</b> to focus attention on it other than to deride its significance:</p>
<p>There are very few movements more threatening to dishonest political leaders than a revolt led by the middle class.</p>

<p>Who really started the Tea Party Tax Protest Movement in our country?</p>
<p>This is just idle curiousity on my part &#8211; prompted by an interesting editorial that appeared in today’s online edition of SCV’s hometown newspaper-<br />
<a href="http://www.the-signal.com/news/article/12187/"><b><i>The Signal</i></b></a> .</p>
<p>The editorial, written by Steve Lunetta is titled <b>The SCV ‘Tea Party’</b></p>
<p>Is this really an ‘<i>astro-turf’</i> movement started by the Republican Party leadership or by rich people who want to get out of paying higher taxes?</p>
<p>Listen to what U.S House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has to say about this.</p>
<p><object width="190" height="172"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/P44q7Jt68DA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="never"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/P44q7Jt68DA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="never" width="190" height="172"></embed></object></p>
<p>What role-if any- did the Libertarian Party members have in growing this movement? (Refer to The Signal article-bloggers’ comments-for excellent weblinks.)</p>
<p>What about the citizens who participated in the protests but don’t belong to either of these two parties-what does this mean?</p>
<p>Does it matter who started it-why or why not ?</p>
<p>And lastly, what happens next with regards to the nurturing and growth of this movement? Steve has an excellent suggestion on this point.</p>
<p>As the various diverse leaders (diverse with respects to party affiliation, education and/or socio-economic levels etc…) of the Tea Party Tax Protest movement proceed to their next stages, I would advise them to pay notice to blogger Brad’s warning:</p>
<p>“There are people out there who would love to weaken and ultimately get rid of this Tea Party Tax Protest movement and the first way to do this is to get people arguing with each other about who should get credit for starting it. <b><i>The easiest way to conquer a group is to divide it first</i>…”</b></p>

Is someone trying to make the Tea Party Tax Protest movement appear toxic?<br />
Is this nothing more than defamatory propaganda?<br />
For those of you who attended these Tea Party Tax Protests- what do you think? Does what Garofalo say have any validity?</p>

<p>Planning Fun with Teabaggers!</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, my husband and I will be venturing into the wilds disguised as a news crew to do some in person interviewers with teabaggers here in [State Redacted] (if we can find any). We&#8217;ve got some questions lined up to ask, but I&#8217;d love to get suggestions!</p>
<p>The great thing about owning professional video equipment is that armed with it, you can pass yourself off as being a professional news crew pretty easily.</p>
<p>So tomorrow, [Fake Station Name Redacted] is going to send a cameraman and on air news personality out into the field to cover this &#8220;teabagging&#8221; phenomenon.</p>
<p><b>We&#8217;re going to ask open ended questions that seem to have a slight conservative bent to (hopefully) get them to open up and just start ranting. Then, we take any examples of racism, hatred, ignorance, and stupidity that we catch on camera and make a little movie out of it. Probably a YouTube special. “</b><br />

<p>Celebrity blogger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perez_hilton"><b>Perez Hilton</b></a> served as a judge in last weeks Miss USA pageant.</p>
<p>He asked Miss California (prop 8 state) whether or not all states should follow Vermont’s recent decision to legalize same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>Miss California (Carrie Prejean) voiced her personal view on the issue. This evidently, was not the politically correct thing to do.</p>
<p>Some say this may have cost her the pageant crown.</p>

<p>Miss CA: &#8216;I&#8217;m Going To Do Whatever It Takes To Protect Marriage.&#8217; Lauer: Some Compare You To Palin (6:11)</p>
</h2>
<p>Miss California has agreed to be a spokesperson for <a href="http://www.nationformarriage.org/site/c.omL2KeN0LzH/b.3479573/k.E2D0/About_NOM.htm"><b>The National Organization for Marriage (NOM)</b></a>.</p>
<p>According to its website,NOM is a nonprofit organization (founded in 2007) with a mission to protect marriage and the faith communities that sustain it. Its focus is to serve as a clearinghouse/resource center for marriage-related initiatives at the state and local level.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions as you watch and listen to this You Tube posting of a segment from the Today Show (aired on Thursday 4/30).</p>
<ul>
<li>Should people be confronting the biased judge or the opinionated pageant contestant?</li>
<li>Who had an agenda to carry through in this pageant? The judge or the contestant?</li>
<li>Did Hilton produce a similar tirade (in any media format) against President Obama when the president (as a presidential candidate) voiced an almost identical opinion as Miss California regarding his statement that marriage should be between a man and a woman?</li>
<li>Why was Governor Sarah Palin’s name injected into Matt Lauer’s comments?</li>
<li>Anyone heard anything from the Donald (aka Donald Trump) or any pageant officials?</li>
<li>Can US beauty pageant contestants expect to be evaluated by biased pageant judges in future pageants?</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we care?</p>
<p>Note: I refer to Hilton as &#8216;biased&#8217; based upon his post-pageant statements and actions-not necessarily because of the question he asked Miss California (although some people feel that this was a &#8216;loaded&#8217; question-and did not belong in a publicly or privately-held Miss USA Beauty Pageant interview).</p>
<p>Prejean is very opinionated concerning this issue however, no one would have known what her private opinion was IF Hilton had not asked her this question regarding gay marriage.</p>

<p>California voters are bracing themselves for what has become a campaigning ritual in our country. They will soon be wading through a flood of emotionally-charged sound bites to reach a decision as to how they should vote with regards to the six budget-related measures that are being decided upon in the May 2009 Special Election-an election necessitated by the state’s near catastrophic fiscal condition.</p>
<p>As soon as the ink was dry on both the Sacramento deal to close the $42 billion budget deficit, and the Washington DC deal allowing California to receive about $17.5 billion from federal fiscal stimulus aid, California voters were informed that the state could be facing an additional $14 billion budget deficit if Prop 1A and other budget-related measures on the May 19 ballot fail to pass.</p>
<p>The problem is that, the way many informed voters see it, not one of the six budget-related propositions being voted on during the May 19 Special Election offers any long-term solutions on how to avoid fiscal fiascos like the one California is presently facing. These six propositions are merely stop gap measures. None of the propositions address the structural deficit in the state budget and the flawed budget process.</p>
<p>How did California get to this point?</p>
<p>Many blame California legislators’ arguably reckless attitude when it comes to relying on the use of bond financing to fund some of its critical infrastructure needs (including transportation, water, education).</p>
<p>California has increasingly used borrowing through state general obligation bonds to finance infrastructure projects. But the need for infrastructure investment—an estimated $500 billion over the next 20 years (approximately $25 billion per year) far exceeds what these bonds can bring in, according to the <a href="http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/atissue/AI_109EHAI.pdf"><b>Public Policy Institute of California</b></a> report, Paying for Infrastructure: California’s Choices.</p>
<p>California needs a long–term solution with regards to how infrastructure investments are financed in the future. None of the ballot propositions being presented to the voters offers any such solutions for consideration.</p>
<p>The Governor and the legislative leaders want us to believe that if the citizens vote against some of the six budget-related measures , this will lead the state into a fiscal meltdown.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty hefty responsibility to lay on the shoulders of the citizens. The citizens, however, can rise to the occaision and do the right thing provided they have access to accurate, unbiased, truthful information.</p>
<p>It”s tough enough that these propositions contain fiscal-related language (which many voters may not be familiar with) but now we find out that wordings in some of the propositions are <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/08/BA8616AKTV.DTL"><b>misleading</b></a>.</p>
<p>Former LA mayor Richard Riordan ( a liberal Republican who voted for President Obama) is absolutely livid. Read what he has to say about the fraud he claims is being perpetrated on the California voters- a fraud he refers to as a &#8217;scam&#8217; in his editorial titled <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-riordan29-2009mar29,0,3270078.story"><b>California&#8217;s May ballot scam.</b></a></p>
<p>How did California get to the point that necessitated this special election?<br />
Read this informative and easy to follow <a href="http://ca.lwv.org/lwvc/pdf/2009-01_budget.pdf"><b>summary</b></a> of the situation and issues.</p>
<p>The information presented below includes excellent sources to consider when deciding which ballot propositions to support.</p>
<p>(A) The California Secretary of State (SOS)<br />
I always start here<a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/quick-reference-guide/prop1a.htm"><b>SOS</b></a>.</p>
<p>After reviewing the SOS website, I continue my research as follows :</p>
<p>(B) The Legislative Analysts Office (LAO)<br />
I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/LAOApp/ballot_source/Propositions.aspx"><b>The LAO reports.</b></a>The LAO is the California government’s non &#8211; partisan fiscal and policy advisor..<br />
The group presents its reviews in a very clear, concise and interesting manner.</p>
<p>The analysts however <b>do not offer endorsements.</b>They leave that up to you.</p>
<p>(C) California League of Women Voters(CA LWV)<br />
After reading the LAO reports, I like to review the non-partisan <a href="http://ca.lwv.org/action/prop0905/index.html"><b>California League of Women Voters’</b></a> website. This website is very valuable to me during election time. It contains a lot of information and the people who maintain the site respect the citizen’s time. These people call it like they see it-no holds barred-no fluff.</p>
<p>Their opinions are backed by solid facts. Although I may not always agree with them on every issue, <b>I do place great importance on their recommendations and endorsements.</b>.</p>
<p>During election periods (local, state, or national), I make sure to read through the editorial sections of several newspapers that have a good reputation when it comes to political analysis. These papers include the <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/opinion/"><b>Sacramento Bee,</b></a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/?track=mainnav-editorials"><b>The Los Angeles Times</b></a>, <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/sections/opinion/"><b>The Orange County Register</b></a> and the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/editorials/index.html"><b>New York Times</b></a></p>
<p>These writers/editors help to put the icing on the cake when it comes to getting a well-rounded overview of certain issues or propositions. They keep their ears low to the ground and write about political nuances that the LAO and CA LWV do not/will not/can not cover for a variety of reasons. Here again, I do not always agree with the positions that some of the editors or writers take however, I always hear them out.I appreciate their clarity of thinking, and their collection and presentation of information to the public.</p>
<p>Lastly, I like to surf the internet to see what other tidbit of information I can come up with that will help me to better understand the issues that I am being asked to vote for or against. For example, check out these interesting articles/editorials (all ‘MUST READS’ before you vote on May 19).<br />
From <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?blogid=14&amp;entry_id=37426"><b>The San Francisco Chronicle’s</b></a> blog site<br />
<b>“Money seals the deal between Schwarzenegger and CTA”</b> editorial written by John Wildermuth 3/25/09</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.modbee.com/opinion/walters/story/615560.html"><b>The Modesto Bee-</b></a>. This is an excellent editorial containing some VERY interesting observations concerning ‘deals’ surrounding some of the ballot props . I learned about ‘poison pills’ in my investment banking classes but this is the first time I have seen the concept applied in state government politics. Written by Dan Walters 3/1/09 : <b>“California budget election is the next step”</b></p>

<p>This news article helps to put some of the Governor’s actions into historical perspective. Anybody notice a trend in the Gov’s actions?</p>
<p>I have chosen as to how I will vote on each of the propositions however I will not release my choices on this website for another few weeks until we get closer to the election.</p>

<p><a href="http://reason.com/news/printer/134445.html"><b>Here</b></a> is an interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian"><b>libertarian-based interpretation</b></a> of the recent special election results in California.</p>
<p>This article is important, once again, because of the country-wide ramifications stemming from this trend on the west coast.</p>
<p>The voters’ voices were heard and now…California politicians and the media are implying-in so many words- that the voters are uninformed and stupid and are operating under a ‘mob rule’ mentality???</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://reason.com/news/printer/134445.html"><b>this article</b></a> posted in the latest edition of Reason magazine:</p>
<p>“California Screaming-The Golden State&#8217;s political class comes unglued in the face of a citizens&#8217; revolt.”</p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p><i>On May 19, California voters went to the polls to decide whether to pass a package of six tax-and-gimmick ballot propositions. Its supporters—Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Democratic legislative leaders, the California Teachers Association, and the overwhelming majority of the state’s major newspapers—billed it as the last best hope to plug Sacramento’s $24 billion budget deficit. “Either pass it,” warned the Los Angeles Times editorial board, “or risk fiscal disaster.”</p>
<p><b>Those who believe that either money or the media determine political outcomes should pay close heed to what happened next:</b> Although opponents were <b>outspent by more than 7 to 1</b>, they trounced the state’s political class, rejecting five of the six measures by an average of 30 percentage points. The only proposition to pass was an anger-driven new law that limits elected officials’ salaries.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times headlined its morning-after news analysis, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/20/local/me-analysis20?pg=1"><b>“California Voters Exercise Their Power—and That’s the Problem.”</b></a>.</p>
<p>Sacramento columnist George Skelton argued that “voters helped get themselves into this fix” by “passing feel-good ‘ballot box budgeting’ initiatives” and sanctioning “heavy borrowing” for “infrastructure projects.”</p>
<p>Business columnist Michael Hiltzik averred that “far more blame for the deficit belongs to California voters” because “year in, year out, they enact spending mandates at the polls, often without endowing a revenue source.” <b>Missing from any of these critiques was the fact that the Times’ own editorial board endorsed more than 90 percent of the very same ballot-box bond measures during the last decade. No matter: A perpetrator had been located.</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/story/1878225.html"><b>“Good morning, California voters,”</b></a> The Sacramento Bee’s post-election editorial began. “Do you feel better, now that you’ve gotten that out of your system?” The Bee, which (like the Times) had endorsed four of the five losing measures, came under immediate attack for its heavy-handed, citizen-blaming sarcasm.</p>
<p><b>Rarely has the chasm between elite political discourse and grubby popular opinion been displayed in such sharp relief. The implications of this citizen revolt—and the hostile reactions to it—stretch far beyond Nevada’s western border. California is the Ghost of Federal Government Future.</b></i></p>

<p>Hmmm…this is interesting.</p>
<p>From a post in today’s SacBee:<br />
<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/the_state_worker/2009/06/administration-launches-new-wa.html"><b>Administration Launches New Waste Reporting Web Site</b></a></p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p><i>The Schwarzenegger administration says it wants to encourage state workers to report government waste through a new feature on its Reporting Transparency in Government Web site, called <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/report"><b>&#8220;Waste Watchers.&#8221;</b></a>.</p>
<p>The site allows <b>anonymous online reporting of government waste,</b> although submitters can leave their name and e-mail address if they&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>An administration official will monitor the site, said Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll investigate every submission.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>In an effort to promote a system of ‘checks and balances’- do not forget to review <a href="http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homePage"><b>this citizen-run website</b></a> also.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FAQ"><b>Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW)</b></a> is, according to its website description, <i>“ a private, non-partisan, non-profit organization representing more than one million members and supporters nationwide.</p>

<p>UPDATE X I V<br />
June 2, 2009</p>
<p>Here is one story that can be filed under the “WHAT THE HECK WAS HE THINKING???” category.</p>
<p>According to this article in the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/california-budget/ci_12454979?nclick_check=1"><b>McClatchy Company-owned Mercury News</b></a> titled “Billions in new cuts loom for California — including eliminating welfare and closing most state parks”, <i><b>Medi-Cal coverage for dialysis and for breast and cervical cancer treatment for those over age 65 would be cut.</b></i></p>
<p>When times are tough, we have to swallow some bitter medicine however…I almost choked when I read about this.</p>
<p>Am I understanding this correctly?</p>
<p>Can I infer from this article that anyone over 65 years of age who has been receiving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medi-Cal"><b>Medi-Cal</b></a> coverage for dialysis and for breast and cervical cancer treatment will be left to financially fend for themselves to continue treatment… or possibly die if the illness becomes terminal?</p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p><i>Schwarzenegger had warned before last week&#8217;s special election that if voters did not approve a host of tax and budget-reform measures, stunning cuts to social services, education and other vital state programs would be necessary.</p>
<p>So, in the wake of the resounding &#8220;no&#8221; that came from a disillusioned electorate, he has held true to his promise and then some:</p>
<p>The budget proposal would eliminate vast swaths of programs, including CalWORKs — the welfare program serving more than 521,000 families who now receive $526 average monthly grants — and Healthy Families, which subsidizes health care for low-income children whose families don&#8217;t qualify for Medi-Cal <a href="http://www.medi-cal.ca.gov/"><b>(Medi-Cal website)</b></a>. Those cuts would also cost the state billions in federal matching funds.</p>
<p>End of excerpts.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)"><b>‘stream of consciousness’</b></a> response to this news item…</p>
<p></i></b>
<ul>
<li><i>Is the Gov trying to encourage more personal bankruptcies in California?</i></li>
<li><i>Does the Gov own shares of stock in the publicly traded pharmaceutical corporation- Merck &amp; Co <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Prevention/HPV-vaccine"><b>which produces The Guardasil vaccine</b></a> that supposedly can prevent several types of cervical cancer-causing viruses? I am seeing increased efforts to <a href="http://www.ktvn.com/global/story.asp?s=10462759&amp;ClientType=Printable"><b>market</b></a> this vaccine.</i></li>
<li><i>Is he trying to promote a culture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"><b>euthanasia</b></a>. Last year, the Governor (with the state assembly’s blessing) signed into effect Bill AB 2747 known as <b>The Right to Know End-of-Life Options Act.</b> Take a <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2701-2750/ab_2747_bill_20080903_enrolled.html"><b>look</b></a> at who has the right to define terminal illness (Section 442.5).

Is it now too much of a financial drain on the health care system to provide certain health care benefits to people over 65 who suffer from certain illnesses? What does this say about the values of our society with respects to how we look out for the welfare of our elderly citizens? Will this ‘indirect encouragement’ of euthanasia or assisted suicide (for people over 65 years of age who have certain illnesses which may/may not evolve into a &#8216;terminal&#8217; status) be extolled as a humanitarian act in our society &#8211; since many will no longer be able to receive medical help which may save their lives or at least ease the pain of their remaining days on this earth???</i></li>

<p><b>UPDATE X I I I<br />
May 24, 2009</b></p>
<p>In spite of what I may think about some of his past actions, I have to give credit where credit is due.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_gingrich"><b>Newt Gingrich</b></a> is very intelligent.</p>
<p>This is one of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/21/AR2009052103724_pf.html"><b>best editorials</b></a> that I have read (translation: I agree with most of what this author says) regarding how to interpret the results of the May 19 Special Election.</p>
<p>Gingrich looks at the election from a ‘macro’ perspective. He ‘gets’ the ‘big picture’.</p>
<p>The only thing that I do not agree with in this editorial is the fact that Gingrich makes too many ‘excuses’ for Governor Schwarzenegger’s actions.</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p>Americans should look carefully at the anti-politician, anti-government mood exhibited in California last week. Just as Proposition 13 and the anti-tax movement of 1978 were the forerunners of the Reagan presidential victory, so the results of Tuesday&#8217;s vote are a harbinger of things to come.</p>
<p>The repudiation of the California establishment in the series of initiative defeats could hardly have been more decisive. Five taxing and spending measures were rejected by 62.6 to 66.4 percent of the voters.<br />
That is a consistent majority of enormous potential. An even larger majority, 73.9 percent, approved the proposition limiting elected officials&#8217; salaries when there is a deficit.</p>
<p>This vote is the second great signal that the American people are getting fed up with corrupt politicians, arrogant bureaucrats, greedy interests and incompetent, destructive government.</p>
<p>The elites ridiculed or ignored the first harbinger of rebellion, the recent tea parties. While it will be harder to ignore this massive anti-tax, anti-spending vote, they will attempt to do just that.</p>

<p><b>Excerpts:</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Schwarzenegger initially talked about extending the sales tax to cover tickets to sporting events and amusement parks. It’s not entirely clear how that would have worked and who would have paid; the idea never made it to the ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if the propositions do pass, the money they raise might give state lawmakers a little budgetary breathing room – enough to keep the idea of new amusement-park taxes at bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Disney is not the only entertainment colossus to see the wisdom of the ballot propositions sometime after Schwarzenegger backed away from taxing its tickets. A number of sports teams have gotten behind the pro-propositions effort as well.&#8221;</p>

“<i>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to seek the elimination of more than 1,700 state firefighting positions and closure of scores of fire stations if voters reject key ballot measures in the May 19 special election, according to documents obtained by The Chronicle on Monday</i>.”</p>
<p>End of excerpt.</p>
<p>The Governor is blackmailing the voters into supporting the ballot measures or else he threatens to slash $80.8 million from <a href="http://www.cdffirefighters.org/cdffirefighters.aspx"><b>Cal Fire’s</b></a> budget.</p>
<p>Cal Fire is the state’s fire agency and includes about 5,000 full-time firefighters.</p>
<p>Wait, didn’t the Gov praise CalFire last year for saving the state of California from burning down yet now this year he threatens to cut their jobs right before fire season starts???</p>

<p><b>UPDATE V I I I<br />
04/28/09</b></p>
<p>Last week, a committee supported by Governor Schwarzenegger (and advised by political consultants) officially kicked off the campaign advertising effort that will have voters’ heads spinning by May 19.</p>
<p>The effort involves the formulation of newspaper, radio and television ads that will shape how you think and feel about the May 19th ballot propositions.</p>
<p>These ads have one goal in mind: to get you to ‘Vote Yes’ on all propositions.</p>
<p>In some ads, you will find the selective presentation of facts (lying by omission) and/or loaded messages which are meant to get you to “STOP THINKING” and instead to “START FEELING” with respects to the information that is being ‘sold’ to you.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, feeling ‘warm and fuzzy’ or ’scared to death’ can short-circuit your brain’s neuron transmissions quite easily. As a result, you might accidentally leave your brain home on election day as you go to vote.</p>
<p>Some of these campaign advertising techniques are so subliminal in nature that many voters will never know what hit them before they go to the polls.</p>
<p>So…what’s a voter to do? How does one make sense of all these ads?</p>
<p>Enter center stage The Sac Bee’s Ad Watch column.</p>
<p>Periodically, various Sac Bee journalists write articles in which they discuss a new ad.</p>
<p>Let’s have some fun here.</p>

</h2>
<p>2- Answer the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>What emotional response(s) is the ad trying to solicit from the voters?</li>
<li>How is the ad doing this?</li>
<li>How is the ad packaging the ballot propositions i.e. ‘single issues’ versus lumping them all together ?</li>
<li>Are there any facts ‘missing’ from this ad that an informed voter needs to know before they go to the polls?</li>
</ul>
<p>3- Read this:<br />

<p>The SacBee has set up a special <i>Elections Question Forum</i>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a great source for information about California politics and issues surrounding the May 19 Special Election.</p>
<p>If you can set aside five minutes per day, peruse this site to see what questions citizens like yourself are asking.</p>
<p>Also, do not be shy about submitting your own question to the SacBee!</p>
<p>Here is the first question posed in the SacBee Elections Question Forum:</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p><b>Unions usually stand together. Why are some supporting Proposition 1A and some opposing it or staying neutral?</b></p>
<p>A: Labor unions have long opposed spending limits for fear that restraining growth of state spending would mean fewer public services and jobs for the people they represent. But unions have split over Proposition 1A because they believe its effects will impact them in different ways due to the way in which it was crafted.</p>

<p>Learn why the <a href="http://www.cft.org/resources/leg/index.html"><b>California Federation of Teachers (CFT)</b></a>and the <a href="http://www.cta.org/home.aspx"><b>California Teachers Association (CTA)</b></a> disagree with each other when it comes to Proposition 1A and Proposition 1B.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/021594.html"><b>VERY SHORT article</b></a> attempts to provide an explanation as to how these two groups are urging their members to vote on Props 1A and 1B on May 19 and why the groups have taken these positions..</p>
<p>Note: The CTA is the largest teachers’ union in California-representing over 295,000 members in the state’s more than 1000 school districts. It is quite possibly the most powerful union in the state for a number of reasons-including the fact that <s>it that</s> where the union decides to invest its pension plan assets can literally make or break an industry. That is how well-funded the the CTA&#8217;s pension plan is.</p>
<p>The CFT is an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). According to its website, CFT is made up of 135 local unions representing over 120,000 educational employees working at every level of the education system in California, from Head Start to the University of California.</p>

<p>Dan Walters: Tax policy reflects state&#8217;s wacky politics</p>
<p>This interesting <a href="http://www.modbee.com/opinion/walters/story/666629.html"><b>political editorial</b></a> written by SacBee State Columnist Dan Walters provides a clear and concise ‘bird’s eye view’ of the tax situation in the state of California.</p>
<p>-Is the tax system faulty?<br />
-Does it need repair?<br />
-Why do some people strongly support doing away with the two thirds legislative vote requirement on tax increases?</p>
<p>These are just a few of the issues he discusses in his editorial- which serves as good background for the May 19 Special Election in CA.</p>
<p>Note: I appreciate Dan Walter’s writing style. He writes in a way so as to be understood (Ernest Hemingway-style).</p>

<p>The Service Employees International Union and the California Faculty Association and the California Federation of Teachers have formed a committee <b>OPPOSING Proposition 1A</b>.

<p>I initially planned to include this article as an “Update” in a previously published post titled:</p>
<p><a href="http://scvjournal.com/blog/?p15"><b>California’s Special Election Propositions: Short-Term Fixes for Long-Term Financial Crisis? “</b></a>.</p>
<p>I changed my mind however and wrote this as a separate article so as to be able to include recent information that may influence voters on how to cast their votes <b>tomorrow, May 19</b> in California’s Special Election.</p>
<p>I recently read the following article <a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/1399594.html"><b><br />
“California wants Congress to back its loans temporarily”</b></a> which, to put it mildly…alarmed me.</p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>“In coming weeks, Congress is expected to debate whether to take the unprecedented step of guaranteeing the state&#8217;s emergency borrowing on a short-term basis.”</p>
<p>“Proponents say they&#8217;re not asking Washington for a bailout, merely trying to lower the state&#8217;s borrowing costs by having the federal government back its loans. Critics say, however, that it would be a drastic mistake that would jeopardize the federal government&#8217;s AAA credit rating, noting that California ranks as the worst credit risk among the 50 states. “</p>
<p>End of excerpts.</p>
<p>There is a saying that “as California goes, so goes the nation”. For many years our state has served as a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bellwether"><b>‘bellwether state’</b></a> with respects to fiscal and social policies that have ultimately been replicated into laws and/or <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/referendums"><b>national referendums.</b></a> in other states throughout the country.</p>
<p>Could California’s request for guarantees on its ‘short-term’ emergency borrowing start off a ‘copycat trend’ across the nation?</p>
<p>Is short-term borrowing any way to fund the infrastructure of a state? What happens if California defaults on its borrowing?</p>
<p>What happens to this country if other states follow suit? Who will lend America the money to stay afloat?</p>
<p>As much as I love my adopted state of California, I love my entire country more. This may help to explain my choice to VOTE NO on ALL six ballot propositions being presented to California voters <b>tomorrow</b>, Tuesday, May 19.</p>
<p>I do not believe in “ballot-box budgeting”.</p>
<p>We need a major revamping of our State Constitution including how the budget process operates.</p>
<p>We don’t have time to keep applying ‘band-aids’ to the problem-year after year.</p>
<p>In addition, it is despicable as to how certain legislators are implying that if California ‘crashes’ it is the voters’ fault because we rejected the propositions.</p>
<p>Good God- how stupid or how desperate do our legislators think we are?</p>
<p>Passing these propositions instead of sending legislators back to the ‘drawing board’ will-in my opinion- cause our state citizens more harm in the long run- NO MATTER WHAT SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROUP our citizens belong to-rich, middle class, poor or dirt-poor.</p>
<p>In addition, why should the rest of the nation take an economic hit because California has not been managed in a sound fiscal manner?</p>
<p>I included various sources in my <a href="http://scvjournal.ning.com/profiles/blogs/californias-special-election"><b>previously written article</b></a>that explain the pros and cons of each proposition.</p>
<p>I weighed these pros and cons and came to a conclusion. However after I thought that I had reached my conclusion, I came across additional facts (sources are included in various sections of this article) that helped me to better understand our situation from a ‘macro’ perspective.</p>
<p>I won’t waste your time rehashing any specific proposition however, I will state that I am furious that our state government has such low respect for the intelligence of California voters so as to include the ‘feel good’ Proposition 1F ( Freezing legislator salaries when the budget is off which would ban lawmakers from giving themselves raises in deficit years) on the ballot.</p>
<p>What does this action tell the rest of the nation about the ethics and motivations of our state legislators that we have to blackmail them (while using a pretty weak incentive to boot!) into agreeing on a budget in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>If voters don’t like the ‘speed’ with which our legislators make budget-related decisions- then we have to go to the source of the problem –we need to amend the State Constitution. Enough with the BS slapping of the wrists so that we voters can feel ‘warm and fuzzy’ to the point of distraction from the real causes of our financial problems.</p>
<p>This is why I will VOTE NO on ALL the ballot measures.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting article that appeared recently in <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13649050&amp;source=hptextfeature"><b>”The Economist”</b></a> .</p>
<p>The title “The Ungovernable State” pretty much says it all.</p>
<p>How sad that California is now being held up as a ‘warning’ to other states in our country of how NOT TO RUN A STATE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>The author discusses the implications of California’s May 19 election and why it may be time to devise a new state constitution.</p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>&#8220;The occasion has thus become an ugly summary of all that is wrong with California’s governance, and that list is long. This special election, the sixth in 36 years, came about because the state’s elected politicians once again—for the system virtually assures as much—could not agree on a budget in time and had to cobble together a compromise in February to fill a $42 billion gap between revenue and spending. But that compromise required extending some temporary taxes, shifting spending around and borrowing against future lottery profits. These are among the steps that voters must now approve, thanks to California’s brand of direct democracy, which is unique in extent, complexity and misuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good outcome is no longer possible. California now has the worst bond rating among the 50 states. Income-tax receipts are coming in far below expectations.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ran across this very interesting blog-posted by Brad (?) in our local newspaper&#8217;s website:<br />
The blogger (Brad- who remains anonymous) was responding to an excellent editorial that was written by a local SoCal columnist named Roger Gitlin.</p>
<p><cite>Here is the link</cite> to Roger&#8217;s well-written editorial and Brad&#8217;s response:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.the-signal.com/news/article/9913">Editorial</a></p>
<p>I liked Roger&#8217;s editorial for several reasons including the points he raised PLUS the fact that he included information regarding who in government to contact to voice your opinions to.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Verify">E-Verify Program background</a></p>
<p>I have taken the liberty of reprinting Brad&#8217;s blog comment below:</p>
<p>The E-Verify Program, on which businesses across the country rely to screen<br />
employment of illegal aliens expires this Friday, March 6.</p>
<p><em>Congress is ‘hoping’ We the People won’t notice that they removed the extension of this crucial service from the “Stimulus Plan” and the issue has been ignored and screened out of Mass Media news coverage.</em></p>
<p>An observant citizen might note that there are &#8220;Millions for pay-offs and pork, but nothing to<br />
support LEGAL EMPLOYMENT&#8221;</p>
<p>Would anyone care to offer an explanation as to why Congress has chosen to leave renewal of this program out (with no public discussion) of the stimulus plan?</p>
<p>This O V E R S I G H T was caught by people who actually reviewed the wording of the Stimulus Plan.</p>
<p>Yes&#8230;some people actually did go through the Stimulus Plan (they were forced to do so AFTER it was passed by Congress because they were not given the opportunity to do so before its rubber stamp passage took place)</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s illegal immigrants will (most likely) be tomorrow&#8217;s legal DNC constituents if and when they become citizens. Once they become citizens, they will be informed over and over as to how the Democratic Party helped them gain their citizenship and will be told by groups such as ACORN that these new citizens owe their citizenship and freedom and lastly, their loyalty to the DNC and labor unions.</p>
<p>This possibile scenario makes certain that Democrats can win every national election from this point forward.</p>
<p>President Obama won the 2008 election by approximately 7 million votes.</p>
<p>Under the &#8216;doublespeak&#8217; title of &#8220;immigration reform&#8221;, is Congress, perhaps, attempting to bring in more than ten million new constituents into their fold(based upon the estimate that 13 to 25 million illegal immigrants now live and work in the USA).</p>
<p>Are certain people in Congress trying to win favor with illegal aliens now so they can gain their loyalty, and once t hese new citizens start working-ultiumately force them to join the labor unions (I say &#8216;force&#8217; because the Employee Free Choice Act -EFCA- DOES NOT ALLOW the use of secret ballots by employees when they vote on union issues so the potential for &#8216;payback &#8216; in the form of losing your job if you dont support Unions-is great)</p>
<p>I support the idea of giving illegal aliens a PATH to EARN their way into american citizenship-legally.<br />
I DO NOT support forcing illegal aliens to be beholden to the Democratic Party -and labor unions-for the rest of their lives once they obtain citizenship.</p>
<p>EFCA will prmote the forcing of new citizens into servitude to the labor unions.</p>
<p>Letting E Verify program expire will win favor for the DNC among illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Promotion of EFCA (as it is currently written) will make sure that he or she who controls the labor unions will be able to continue to do so indefinetely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stay tuned. Get involved.</p>

<h3><strong>************************ Updates Below *************************</strong></h3>
<p><strong>UPDATE II</strong><br />
3/28/09</p>
<p>Congress stripped language from the Omnibus Bill that would have continued funding for the E-Verify program.</p>
<p>No language inclusion- no funding &#8211; no program.</p>
<p>Learn how your senators <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00093"><strong>voted</strong></a> with regards to allowing discussion of the program to see if funding for it should be included in the Omnibus Bill.</p>
<p>Clarification:</p>
<p>The vote was whether to table –refuse to discuss- the amendment to see if it should be included in the Omnibus Bill.</p>
<p>A YES vote (signifying ‘Yes, I refuse to discuss E Verify Amendment ’ for possible inclusion in the Omnibus Bill) is against E-Verify.</p>
<p>A NO vote (signifying ‘No I don’t want to ignore the E Verify Amendment-I want to discuss it-in effort to try to include it in Omnibus Bill) is supporting E-Verify.</p>
<p><strong>The E Verify program will remain enforced</strong> however, for the time being, at least until <strong>Thursday, May 21 2009.</strong></p>
<p>On that date, a final ruling will take place ( H.R. 1105- Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 ) MANDATING (requiring) certain federal contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE I</strong><br />
3/27/09</p>
<p>Several <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS165551+04-Mar-2008+PRN20080304"><strong>groups</strong></a> throughout the country do not support the E-Verify program for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Reasons for opposition include questions about the perceived reliability of the system (data error rates)<br />
and fraud/ identity theft.</p>
<p>The opposition arguments sometimes distinguish between</p>
<p>1-who the program will pertain to-all employers/federal contractors/ subcontractors- and</p>
<p>2- will the program be applied on a mandatory or volunteer basis?</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.legal-workforce.org./legislation"><strong>website</strong></a> provides more background on the program</p>
