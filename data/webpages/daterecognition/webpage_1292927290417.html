2008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mar 25, Iraqi forces clashed
with Shiite militiamen in the southern oil port of Basra and least 22
people were killed. 5 suspected militants were killed in Basra while
attempting to place a roadside bomb. Gunmen patrolled several Baghdad
neighborhoods as followers of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr ordered a
nationwide civil disobedience campaign to demand an end to the
crackdown on their movement. 2 bombs exploded in central Baghdad,
killing one civilian and wounding eight others. A US-allied Sunni
fighter was killed in a drive-by shooting northeast of the capital. In
August it was reported that a secret deal with an Iran-backed militia
kept British forces out of the battle, leaving US and Iraqi forces to
fight alone. The Ministry of Defense denied any deal was struck and
said it held back to ensure that the operation was seen as Iraqi-led.
The effect was that 4,000 British soldiers were kept out of action for
six days until a deal brokered in Iran ended heavy fighting.<br>
