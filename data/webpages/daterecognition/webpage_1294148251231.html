	<p>I have a favorite saying that goes like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you don&#8217;t know where you are going, any road will get you there</p></blockquote>
<p>This saying rings true when deploying in the cloud.</p>
<p>The following slideshare presentation is a portion of the winning presentation we gave at the 2010 Amazon AWS Startup Challenge as one of the seven finalists out of 1700 companies from across the globe.Â  Our message was <strong>success in the cloud starts with architecture</strong>.Â  I hope you enjoy the presentation.</p>

	<p>Save your self some time from reading all the various blogs on SOA and just listen to the presentation from Anne Thomas Manes which is the sequel to the <a href="http://apsblog.burtongroup.com/2009/01/soa-is-dead-long-live-services.html">SOA is Dead</a> conversation from two years ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Resurrecting-SOA?ref=nf">InfoQ: Resurrecting SOA</a></p>
<p>There is really not much more we need to discuss about SOA now that it is all encapsulated in this excellent presentation.Â  Let&#8217;s move the conversation to lessons learned stories, both successes and failures, and just point back to this presentation for everything else.</p>
<p>Great job Anne!</p>

	<p><span>It is late in the year I and I am already seeing predictions for 2011.  In addition, many people are making predictions about how cloud computing and social software will change the business and IT world going forward.  My friends at <span>Zapthink</span> published an interesting article about how they see enterprise IT changing in the future &#8211; read </span><a href="http://www.zapthink.com/2010/11/17/zapthink-on-enterprise-it-trends-in-the-next-decade/"><span><span>ZapThink</span> on Enterprise IT Trends in The Next Decade</span></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.zapthink.com/2010/11/12/announcing-the-zapthink-2020-poster-the-vision-of-the-future-of-enterprise-it/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_0oE0MdUg0nE/TOSZAV0vkBI/AAAAAAAAEAY/sHl9AhSO_GI/s800/ZapThink-2020-poster-thumbnail-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Well tonight it is my turn to share my thoughts.Â  By the way, I was fairly accurate with <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?m=200812">my predictions back in 2008</a> if you are interested.Â  Here is where I see technology going over the next 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>1. Decline of devices </strong></p>
<p><span>This one is misleading.Â  What I mean is a decline in the number of devices we are willing to buy.Â  Most people will settle on one or two devices: a smart phone and/or a portable Internet device (like today&#8217;s <span>iPad</span>).Â  I see devices like the Kindle, mp3 players, big laptops, portable game players, and the like all becoming obsolete as consumers expect every application to be delivered over the Internet as a service without the need to purchase any kind of device to run it. </span><strong>The days of single purpose devices are coming to an end</strong><span>.Â  If it won&#8217;t run on the phone or on a lightweight <span>iPad</span>-like device, it will not be widely accepted.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. Super Smart Phones will replace your wallet</strong></p>
<p><span>Say good bye to loyalty cards, credit cards, club cards, and cards in general.Â  In fact, say good bye to paper money.Â  In fact, in countries like Japan, this is already reality.Â  Improvements in mobile reception, <span>WiFi</span> everywhere, and acceptance in mobile payments will make all of this possible.Â  There are a lot of companies working on these solutions.Â  The best solutions will be gobbled up by the big carriers and be delivered as apps on new phones.Â  It&#8217;s </span><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/210782/mobile_providers_form_new_digital_wallet_venture.html">already happening</a> folks.</p>
<p><strong>3. Point of Sale systems will move to the Cloud</strong></p>
<p><span>If you have never worked in the grocery industry, you probably have no idea how proprietary and old these POS systems are.Â  In addition, they are extremely expensive to upgrade and maintain and usually require a third party to manage it for the retailer.Â  The POS vendors have a lot of clout and there are very few of them.Â  They are very limited in modern functionality but they work like a champ.Â  Microsoft is one vendor that is already working on POS in the cloud.Â  Cloud solutions for POS technology will be a no <span>brainer</span> for mom and pop businesses who don&#8217;t want to manage and maintain hardware.Â  The same goes for businesses like restaurants, movie theaters, doctor&#8217;s offices and the like.Â  This movement will force the big POS vendors to start moving to <span>SaaS</span> solutions as well.Â  Once that happens, the grocery industry will move to the cloud with their favorite vendor, but it will be the last industry to do so.Â  It will take the independent grocers to start the movement.Â  Once the big retailers see the independents cutting their POS costs substantially and reflecting those costs in the price of groceries, the big guys will have no choice but to join the party.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>4. Many IT professionals will leave the IT workforce forever</strong></p>
<p><span>As more companies shift to the cloud, roles and <span>skillsets</span> will change.Â  Many people will not adjust and will no longer be marketable in IT.Â  For example, as database and system administration tasks become more automated, those admins who don&#8217;t adapt will have zero value.Â  I have already heard the grumblings from some of these admins as my team tells them how quickly we can have a new server up (5 minutes) and how easy it is for us to manage virtual machines through simple web base interfaces.Â  Instead of grumbling, these guys should embrace these changes and become cloud administration and security gurus.Â  Unfortunately, not everyone is up to the task.Â  But it is not just the admins.Â  Architects, developers, and testers should beware as well.Â  Architects and developers will need to build systems that can easily &#8220;plug-in&#8221; to other enterprises (can you say SOA?).Â  It will all be about integration.Â Â  Testers not only have to keep up with the learning curve but they are in danger of being replaced in large numbers by crowd sourcing testing companies like <span>UTest</span>.Â  You just can&#8217;t compete against the price point of some of these testing companies.Â  Companies like SOASTA will gobble up much of the performance testing work.Â  It just makes so much financial sense to use these services.</span></p>
<p>I am not saying that there will be a huge reduction in IT jobs, although there will be some reduction.Â  What I am saying is that many enterprises will outsource much of their IT services to service providers.Â  Those service providers will have the lion share of jobs and a large pool to choose from.Â  You better be prepared!</p>
<p><strong>5. Cloud Computing will move past hype to reality</strong></p>
<p>Five years from now the term cloud computing will be as commonly accepted as the term client server.Â Â  Almost all modern software will be delivered as a service in a browser and accessible by your mobile phone.Â  Improvements in security services, adoption by major companies and governments, and the maturity of the cloud vendors&#8217; services will make cloud computing the norm.Â  Companies not in the cloud will die off (with few exceptions).Â  They simply won&#8217;t be able to compete at a price point and keep up with the rate of change of their competitors.</p>
<p><strong>6. Architects will still be arguing about the value and definition of enterprise architecture<br />
</strong></p>
<p>There will still be a large body of self proclaimed architects who continue to argue about heavy frameworks and methodologies and semantics while the rest of us have learned to deploy changes weekly to keep up with consumer&#8217;s expectations.Â  People who adapt light EA principles will survive, the heavy guys will perish.Â  With everything being web enabled, cloud enabled, and consumer enabled, one of the the biggest differentiators will be speed to market.Â  Those battles are won on the battle field not in the ivory towers.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><span>The next 5 years will bring change at a rate we have never seen before.Â  I hope in 2015 I get a chance to reflect on this post and score myself.Â  So these are my predictions.Â  Am I crazy?Â  Am I smoking something?Â  Am I on to something?Â  I would love to hear your thoughts.</span></p>

	<p>To some pundits cloud computing is just the next buzz word, the next marketing hype, the next fad, and nothing new.Â  For every pundit, there is an innovator out there taking advantage of on demand resources at a price point that can&#8217;t be matched, with fewer resources and quicker to market.Â  In this post I will show how my company used cloud computing to build an impressive high speed transaction network on a bootstrapped budget and went from unknowns to leaders in the market in just 2 years.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br />
Marketers and technologists were building and deploying innovative solutions to get mobile and web content in the hands of consumers, but there was no standard, secure way to execute at the point-of-sale (POS).  POS integrated solutions were expensive, invasive, and often required new hardware or required users to have smart phones thus alienating a majority of consumers.</p>
<p>The following presentations explain the problem M-Dot Network set out to solve two years ago to the day.</p>

<p><strong>The solution:</strong></p>
<p>Build a standard and secure high speed network with seamless integration at the POS with no additional hardware.Â  Consumers select digital incentives (coupons, web and mobile ads, digital gift cards, etc.) on the web or their mobile device and simply identify themselves at the POS via their loyalty card or mobile phone and automatically receive discounts without ever printing out anything.</p>
<p><strong>The requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Much like an ATM machine, the system must be highly reliable, scalable, and secure.Â  In addition, the implementation of this high speed network should have a zero footprint (no hardware, no additional communication lines, etc) at the retail stores and headquarters and must respond in subseconds.Â  The system must also be able to achieve high scale and handle large spikes in traffic to handle heavy shopping patterns such as special events, holidays, peak hours/days, new retailers joining the network, etc.Â  The network must be up 24x7x365 and needs to have a robust business continuity and disaster recovery plan.Â  Money is only made when transactions are occurring.Â  Therefore, outage = lost revenue and angry consumers and retailers.</p>
<p><strong>The constraints:</strong></p>
<p>All of this must be done on a bootstrap budget with limited capital and a very small IT team.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong></p>
<p>Build a high speed cloud based network connected to a digital incentive Platform as a Service (PaaS).Â  On this platform, channel partners can build marketing and analytical solutions to execute these campaigns in real time across a large network of POS systems for immediate redemption.Â  M-Dot supplies the &#8220;rails&#8221; so marketers can focus on the consumers and not integration.</p>
<p><strong>The approach:</strong></p>
<p><em>Step 1: Build a business architecture</em></p>
<p>In this post a year ago I talked about how we leveraged the E2AF framework to first define what our business architecture was before we chose what our technology was (<a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?tag=e2af">Real time transactions coming soon to a cloud near you</a>).Â  We used the <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=680">E2AF Cheatsheet</a> that I created to answer the important who, what, when, how, where, and with what questions.</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Gather additional requirements</em></p>
<p>After processing all of the information in the E2AF cheat sheet, it was clear to us that we needed to build a highly scalable transaction network that required the security and compliance of an ATM machine.Â  So we hired an expert in that field (<a href="http://www.zsquad.com/">ZSquad</a>) to define all of the security and regulatory requirements that we would need to adhere to when processing digital incentives and consumer data.Â  The E2AF cheat sheet information also helped us decide that the elasticity, low CAPEX, speed to market, and computing capacity of cloud computing was a no brainer for being our choice of our target technology platform.Â  Since we had high speed performance requirements, we chose IaaS (infrastructure as a service) over PaaS (platform as a service) because we wanted total control over the operating system, application server, database, etc.</p>
<p><em>Step 3 &#8211; Evaluate IaaS vendors</em></p>
<p>Once we made that decision to use an IaaS provider,Â  we hired another industry expert (<a href="http://davidlinthicum.sys-con.com/">David Linthicum</a>) to help us with the IaaS vendor selection process and to review our proposed architecture to point out any risks or issues that we may have missed.Â  Based on these factors: global presence, technical maturity, financial stability/longevity, thought leadership, available tools/services&#8230;our choice of Amazon as our IaaS provider was a no brainer.</p>
<p><em>Step 4 &#8211; Prototype</em></p>
<p>One of the best things about the cloud is that you can fire up instances in five minutes and try things out.Â  My architect, Greg Rapp, who is an expert at high speed transaction processing, was able to try many permutations of virtual machines with different mixes of CPU and memory.Â  He was also able to test different database storage engines like MyIsam and Innodb.Â  He could do all this without the need of buying any hardware, requesting change requests to system administrators or DBAs.Â  It was simply Greg and a self service platform, experimenting, testing, researching over and over until he was able to achieve subsecond response time.Â  I summed this up in SeptemberÂ  2009 in an article called <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=1247">using cloud computing to build better software</a>.</p>
<p><em>Step 5 &#8211; Test scale</em></p>
<p>Once we built it, I hit the road with my CEO to sell the platform to grocery retailers.Â  Many retailers doubted our ability to take each transaction out of their building, go to the cloud to process all of the business rules, and return to the store in subseconds across their hundreds of stores.Â  No matter how much I talked about our backgrounds where we managed a network of 30K+ stores to deliver paper coupons on printers at the POS, they were just not convinced.Â  I knew we needed to do a major performance test to prove our worth.Â  In the technical assessment that Dave Lintihicum did for us, he recommended SOASTA as a testing as a service vendor.Â  I called up the SOASTA guys and paid for a 10K concurrent user test.Â  We were able to prove that our transaction network could handle 10K concurrent transactions with an average response time of 98ms sustained over 9 hours.Â  At the same time, SOASTA was trying to find a customer that could handle a one million concurrent user test, something that had never been done before.Â  SOASTA graciously offered to fund the effort for us because they believed our architecture could achieve this milestone.Â  Sure enough, our transaction network passed with flying colors as we successfully delivered a million concurrent transactions with no errors over 1 hour sustained with an average time of 108ms (<a href="www.soasta.com/successstories/ss_mdot.html">see press release</a>).Â  After that test, we were never doubted again by any retailer.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Step 6: Build the platform</em></p>
<p>Now that we had built our high speed transaction network and filed our patents, it was time to build our PaaS on top of Amazon.Â  It is important to note that we have never spent a dime on actual hardware/servers or on software.Â  Our entire development environment is open source (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP stack</a>).Â  All of our 3rd party tools are SaaS (Basecamp, Unfuddle, Sugar CRM, Google Apps, etc.).Â  For more on the tools go <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=1741">here</a>.Â  We were able to get to this point with a total IT infrastructure spend of about $1K per month with just two developers, no system administrators, no DBAs, no nothing!Â  We brought on a great offshore team to build our B2B and B2C applications on our platform.Â  The key to this effort was our approach to dataservices.Â  Architect Jack Hickman implemented our DJango framework and built a suite of RESTful web services so that our offshore team (and channel partners in the future) can simply connect to our platform without any knowledge of the underlying database structures and physical location of the database.Â  I wrote an article called <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=1341">reaping the benefits of data services</a> that goes into detail on our approach.</p>
<p><em>Step 7: Planning for production</em></p>
<p>The next step was to prepare both the real time transaction network and the PaaS for production.Â  This is where the cloud really shines.Â  We architected a fully redundant, self healing, auto-scaling environment thatÂ  replicates all of our data and virtual servers across multiple zones.Â  In essence, we have real time disaster recovery with all of our assets being used all the time.Â  The following article (<a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=1751">Taking the disaster out of disaster recovery</a>) does a deeper dive into how the cloud makes business continuity and disaster recovery both feasible and reliable.</p>
<p><em>Step 8 &#8211; Launch</em></p>
<p>We just officially launched our first chain yesterday (<a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/M-Dot-Network-Delivers-First-Point-Sale-Embedded-Digital-Mobile-Coupon-Program-1352765.htm">press release</a>).Â Â  I am on cloud 9 right now &#8211; pun intended!</p>
<p><strong>Things to think about</strong></p>
<p>This has been a journey, almost 2 years in the making.Â  I think it is important that I point out some things so that my readers can really understand the value of cloud computing.Â  Here are some facts about our solution and path to implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not own a single server</li>
<li>We do not have a datacenter</li>
<li>We do not have a system administrator (although we will hire one in the future)</li>
<li>We do not have a DBA (although we will hire one in the future)</li>
<li>We have a fully redundant production environment across multiple zones</li>
<li>Our solution is faster than our competitors who have dedicated servers in the stores</li>
<li>Our monthly infrastructure bill including redundant prod, stage, and test environments in roughly $2500/month (this is insane!)</li>
<li>Our production environment autoscales to meet the demands of fluctuating traffic</li>
<li>We have not spent a penny on software licenses</li>
<li>We have built a robust enterprise solution on a bootstrap budget</li>
</ul>
<p>And most importantly, we are now the market leader in our industry with more retailer contracts than our competition and we did not exist 2 years ago.Â  Although a lot of this can be attributed to the heroic efforts of our people and our leadership, none of this would be possible without the cloud.Â  We would not even be in business if we had to raise the money to do this on premise.Â  How many companies do you know that have built a high speed transaction network capable of delivering 1M concurrent transactions per minute in 1/10 second on $2k/month worth of infrastructure?</p>
<p>So the next time you see or here someone say the cloud is just hype or declare that &#8220;it is nothing new, we have been doing this for years&#8221;, send them this article and tell them to do their homework.Â  &#8216;Nuff said!</p>

	<p>In this post I will show how cloud computing can make modern disaster recovery planning affordable and actually capable of handling a major crisis.  But first, let&#8217;s go back and look at a typical DR strategy of a non-multi billion dollar company who cannot afford the capital expense of fully redundant data centers.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pre Cloud DR Scenario</strong></p>
<p>Company XYZ has two data centers and has hired a company to pickup tape backups each day from both locations and store safely in an off-site location a few states away.Â  Company XYZ does not have the capital to have an exact replica of their main data center so they had to carefully pick and choose a few core systems to try to replicate as close as possible.Â  The end result is they have some systems that are fully redundant, but most systems are only replicated in an active-passive mode on lesser hardware.Â  Company XYZ has determined that the less critical systems will have to run in a degraded state because the cost of a fully redundant active-active disaster recovery plan is just too expensive to justify.  Company XYZ has a full time resource dedicated to business continuity and disaster recovery.Â  This person has assembled a swat team consisting of both business and IT domain owners and set off to create a large document that defines the company&#8217;s strategy in the event of a disaster.Â  They have documented a ton of processes that have to be implemented in the event of a disaster in order to have a prayer of getting the business up and running.Â  There are huge logistical hurdles such as &#8230;.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do they get their people to the backup site in the event of a disaster?</li>
<li>How fast can they get these passive systems up and active?</li>
<li>How do they keep the documentation and the plan up to date as the systems change over time?</li>
<li>How can they schedule and practice outages?</li>
<li>How do they keep all the active and passive systems current on patches, firmware, parts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on.Â  For most companies that don&#8217;t have 9 or 10 digit IT budgets, disaster recovery planning is an exercise of mitigating the risks in the event of a disaster as opposed to ensuring that the business can run uninterrupted.Â  After all, the feasibility of having fully redundant and active data centers compared to the odds of a disaster make it hard to justify, at least that is what we thought before 911 and Katrina!Â  Now we know better ;-}  To sum it up, many DR plans are constrained by budget and simply try to mitigate risks based on the amount of capital available to them (or the amount that IT was able to beg for from the CFO).Â  <strong>Most DR plans are a disaster waiting to happen!</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cloud DR Scenario</strong></p>
<p>Company ABC is a 2 year old company who built their solution from scratch in the cloud. Â  They have multiple virtual data centers that are running fully redundant active-active data centers.Â  Company ABC has deployed redundant servers managed by redundant load balancers across multiple virtual data centers which are physically located in different data centers.Â  Company ABC has an active-active DR strategy where all zones run identical hardware and software all the time.Â  In fact, company ABC leverages all of their assets all the time, not just when an outage occurs.</p>

</table>
<p>The image above shows how each layer of the architecture is fully redundant across multiple zones.Â  If one zone failed, the other zones would pick up the diverted traffic and automatically scale up more nodes if needed to accommodate the spike in traffic.Â  So let&#8217;s see how this approach addresses the issues listed above:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do they get their people to the backup site in the event of a disaster?Â  <span style="color: #000080;">They don&#8217;t need to.Â  These are virtual data centers with virtual machines.Â  Everything can be managed from a browser.Â  The admins only need to get to a place that has Internet access.Â  They don&#8217;t need to go to a physical data center.</span></li>
<li>How fast can they get these passive systems up and active?Â  <span style="color: #000080;">They are already active and running 24&#215;7.</span></li>
<li>How do they keep the documentation and the plan up to date as the systems change over time?Â <span style="color: #003366;"> <span style="color: #000080;">They still go through the same process of collecting application and business specific information.Â  The difference is the actual plan and the execution of the DR strategy is much simpler and requires way less logistics. </span></span></li>
<li>How can they schedule and practice outages?Â  <span style="color: #000080;">Simply shut down a zone and watch the other zones scale up.</span></li>
<li>How do they keep all the active and passive systems current on patches, firmware, parts, etc.Â  <span style="color: #000080;">Apply patches to the standard image(s) and snapshot them.Â  Take old image offline, create a new patched image from the standard image and deploy code on the newly patched image.Â  Test and then put new image into the rotation behind the load balancers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>With the right architecture, your cloud based DR plan can actually can actually provide fully redundant virtual data centers that are active, not passive, and available 24&#215;7 for a fraction of the costs.Â  The need for purchasing or leasing multiple data centers and hiring the staff associated with the management and operations of the data centers are greatly reduced.Â  In other words, DR can be cost effective and feasible in the cloud.Â  At the end of the day, the money you spend can actually prevent a disaster instead of causing one.</p>

	<p>The stone age developer is me and I just found software development nirvana! Â   From the early 80s to the mid 90s I was a software developer.  In the mid 90s to now I have been in numerous management and architecture roles which have kept me out of the world of coding.  This week I dove back into coding and have totally embraced how productive the new world is versus the environments that I coded in back in the day.  Here is my story.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/QXKqgLf6BrUtbdRAS7KDvLeekyve-7PKPAOWTmHqJD8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_0oE0MdUg0nE/THtP3qrzTpI/AAAAAAAAD-U/32FX09f11KE/s400/428276765_616b92b428_o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Back in the Day</strong><br />
I cut my teeth in software development on the mainframe building COBOL programs with IMS and DB2 databases in the 80&#8242;s along with some dBase and Clipper on IBM PCs with very little memory.  In the 90&#8242;s I moved into the client server world and developed in C and Unix.  I dabbled with FoxPro on some moonlighting gigs and was just starting to get into the Microsoft world with Visual C++ and early versions of VB before I got into management.  Throughout my development days, my working environment was always constrained by access to large databases on large servers and controlled by DBAs and system administrators who cared more about rules than productivity. The Internet was just starting to get into homes and dial-up was the way to connect.Â  The development environments were highly dependent on commercial software being installed on expensive hardware and the toolsets were very limited (and usually expensive too).Â  The languages were very verbose and coding simple functions took many lines of code.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s Nirvana</strong></p>
<p>Today it is a completely different story.Â  I am 100 times more productive developing on a simple netbook.Â  I have no dependency on database servers, commercial software, or anything else.Â  My only constraint now is simply time.Â  Take a look at this environment;</p>

</ul>
<p>All of these tools are either free open source or pay as you go cloud computing services.Â  What makes it even better is that my entire development environment runs on my netbook which means I can code and test when I am on a plane without having to be connected to the Internet.Â  I have a full functioning MySQL server and Apache server running.Â  I can prototype, build, test, and stage on my netbook.Â  Once I have connectivity I can upload my source to Unfuddle either by using SVN Workbench or command line and then migrate to production once everything is reviewed and approved.</p>
<p>I also can download and try various other open source productivity tools with ease thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Software_Center">Ubuntu Software Center</a> (MySQL Administrator, MySQL Query Browser, various editors, and many others).Â  My colleagues and I communicate via <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home">Skype</a> , <a href="http://www.freeconferencecall.com/">FreeConferenceCall.com</a>, and our corporate email/calendar is another SaaS solution, you guessed it, <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html">Google Apps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How does a CTO have time to code?</strong></p>
<p>Look at our environment!Â  I have no datacenter, no servers, no 3rd party software to manage.Â  Business continuity and disaster recovery are <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=1474">built into our architecture</a> and managed dynamically in the cloud.Â  Our voice system is outsourced and we all use our own mobile phones (we have iPhones, Droids, and Blackberries &#8211; who needs to standardize?).Â  I don&#8217;t have time to code a lot because I do have many other responsibilities, but I can knock off the small jobs that need a resource to get off the long list of open tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who never stopped coding, you are probably saying &#8220;big deal&#8221;.Â  But imagine being frozen in ice for 15 years and coming out for the first time to see how much the world has changed.Â  Well that&#8217;s how I feel in this modern day development environment.Â  I feel like a kid at the candy store.Â  Although, I am a little rusty and am a noob to Python, I can still get stuff done faster than before.Â  I owe it all Python and it&#8217;s nimble syntax and my escape from corporate America.Â  The Corporate America that I lived in was very resistant to open source, loved expensive commercial tools that I could not install on my own hardware, and chose to standardize everything at the expense of productivity. Â  In this new world, I have everything I need to develop faster and test better on my dinky little netbook&#8230;connected to the cloud.Â  This is nirvana!</p>

	<p>Todd Biske asked the following question on Twitter earlier in the week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Should Enterprise Architects have/get an MBA?</p></blockquote>
<p>In typical EA fashion, the responses fell into two camps, those for and those against.Â  I happen to think that an MBA is a good thing for an EA to have and not just because I have one.Â  But before I share how my MBA has helped me immensely in my career, I will state on record that some of the most impressive IT and/or EA type people I have ever worked with or read about do not have an MBA.Â  In fact, many never completed an undergraduate program.Â  Also, an MBA is secondary in importance to having a wide range of IT knowledge across the entire enterprise (software development, telecommunications, quality assurance, database management, application integration, security, etc., etc., etc.).Â  At the end of the day, nothing beats hands on, on the job training.Â  Some of the best learning experiences come from failing.Â  An MBA cannot teach that.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ePt9l3ovYSndf3t9b9AySLeekyve-7PKPAOWTmHqJD8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_0oE0MdUg0nE/TG841wE1ayI/AAAAAAAAD98/1AgtfLaQSVo/s800/mba.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>With that said, here is my story about my MBA.Â  I had been working for many years at a previous company and my hopes of advancing higher up were very limited because there was so little turnover in the company.Â  Almost the entire management team had been with the company for 10+ years (including me) so I made a decision to prepare myself for my next career by enrolling in a Master in IT.Â  I felt that to land my dream job of becoming a CTO, I had to expand my knowledge in areas of networking, communications, and other infrastructure related topics since I had spent my whole career in software development.Â  At the same time, I had been trying to convince management that we needed to invest in a business process reengineering and SOA initiative for quite some time.Â  One day, I was able to convince a colleague in our R&amp;D department that the BPM/SOA initiative could create tremendous business and IT value in areas of speed to market, elimination of waste, increased sales, and many other tangible benefits.Â  Over the next several months we tagged teamed and sold the concept to C-level people on the business side and the rest was history.Â  What I learned during the process is that my colleague understood how to speak in the language that each person understood.Â  He could sell to the accountants because he knew what they looked for and understood their jobs.Â  He new how marketing worked.Â  He could create business plans, financial models, calculate payback periods and more.Â  I quickly realized that if I had enrolled in an MBA program that taught me about marketing, economics, finance, accounting, organizational leadership, business law, analysis, and more, I probably could have sold this idea years earlier.Â  So when I finished my MS in IT, I immediately enrolled in MBA program.</p>
<p>I am now a CTO for a young company and still perform many EA-like functions.Â  I frequently meet with investors, clients, lawyers, and partners and have to present to marketing VPs, CIOs, CMOs, lawyers, accountants, VCs, etc.Â  I think my MBA has made me much more effective in this role.Â  I never really had many opportunities to interface with these types of people before so my on the job training in this role was extremely limited.Â  That is why the MBA was so crucial for me.Â  Now that I have been doing this for two years, I have added on the job training on top of my MBA skills.Â  Had I been an entrepreneur my whole career, I probably would not have needed an MBA because I would have experienced all of those roles first hand.</p>
<p>So do EAs need an MBA? No.Â  But if an EA has never walked a day in the shoes of a marketing VP, a controller, a lawyer, a CIO, a Sales executive, an operations executive, and many others, an MBA can transform the EA from a smart IT person to an effective liaison between IT and the business.Â  My MBA was one of the best investments I ever made in my career. I would love to hear your experiences and/or opinions on this.</p>

	<p>While many companies still debate whether it makes sense for them to look to the cloud for their application and data center needs, there should be no debate that the cloud is the place to go for testing.  In this post I discuss three examples of how my company (<a href="www.mdotnetwork.com">M-Dot Network</a>) has leveraged the cloud for testing in ways that are not even feasible in the on-premise world.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prototyping/Discovery</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>:Â  We were building a high speed transaction processing system and did not know how much memory and CPU would be optimal for the architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Pre Cloud</strong> &#8211; In most of the previous projects I worked on in other companies, we typically had to purchase our hardware early in the life-cycle due to long procurement cycles and setup time.Â  Usually we had to order this way before we started prototyping which means we had to take our best guess.Â  The consequences would normally be that we would have to tailor our solution around the hardware that we purchased or existing hardware that we were forced to use.Â  The end result was usually a less than optimal performing solution due to hardware constraints.Â  Instant legacy, how nice!</p>
<p><strong>Cloud </strong>- The procurement and setup issues go away because resources can be provisioned in minutes in the cloud.Â  This allowed us to get deep into the prototyping phase and then test our design against numerous combinations of CPU, memory, and database subsystems.Â  The result was the complete opposite of the old days.Â  Instead of rigging our design to meet the constraints of hardware, we were able to provision the virtual servers that met our performance requirements based on actual test results.Â Â  That is nirvana!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Performance Testing<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>:Â  It is very time consuming and expensive to create performance tests that can simulate millions of transactions from multiple touchpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Pre Cloud</strong> &#8211; Unless you were testing on a soon to be production system, you had no way to do true performance testing without having a replica of your production environment, plus enough hardware/infrastructure to simulate loads that far exceed your current projections.Â  After all, it makes no sense to only test the amount of traffic that you expect to see in production without testing spikes and testing for future growth.Â  I would also argue that one should test the system to see at what load the system starts to break or perform sub-optimally.Â  In the on-premise world, buying additional capacity just to do performance tests coupled with the incredibly high costs of software licensing from tools like Loadrunner is just not feasible.Â  So companies rarely are able to simulate with large enough loads to test scale and simply can&#8217;t afford to provision test systems that are equivalent to their production environments.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud </strong>- We leveraged Testing as a Service.Â  We spent 2 weeks with our technology partner SOASTA and were able to script and deploy a <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/M-Dot-Network-Leverages-Cloud-Test-Digital-Transaction-Platform-1000000-Users-1051640.htm">1 million concurrent user performance test</a>.Â  SOASTA fired up 587 servers and we fired up over 50, that is 600+ servers &#8220;procured&#8221; and installed in an hour.Â  We ran our simulation through out the day testing bursts and sustaining a load of 1 million concurrent transactions and were able to prove that our network could handle transactions for over 200,000 stores concurrently!Â  After we finished the test we tore down all 600+ servers and only paid for the time we used them.Â  Imagine trying that on-premise!Â  A 2 week setup and test of 1 million concurrent transactions per minute leveraging 600+ servers at a very low cost without adding headcount, infrastructure, software licenses, etc.Â  Without a solution like SOASTA&#8217;s Cloudtest, we would not even had attempted a test of this magnitude.Â  We actually discovered and fixed a few bottlenecks along the way.Â  Without this test, those bottlenecks would have been discovered in production and would have impacted our customers.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Resources and Mobile Devices</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>We recently completed our social media manager tool to allow our retailers to manage their SMS groups, Twitter, &amp; Facebook updates from one place (including issuing coupons).Â  To test this we needed to have access to numerous types of mobile devices, carriers, geographical locations, and an army of temporary testing resources.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Cloud</strong>:</p>
<p>In the old days, I would have to purchase, lease, or borrow a large collection of mobile devices across a wide variety of carriers.Â  I would also need to put people in various areas across the country to truly test the experience as the retailers&#8217; customers would experience it.Â  After all, I would rather encounter coverage/carrier issues before consumers do.Â  I could also outsource this to a technology provider for some heavy costs.Â  Either way, this is an expensive undertaking using traditional methods.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud</strong>:</p>
<p>Instead, we partnered with cloud based crowd sourcing testing partner, <a href="http://www.utest.com/">UTest</a>, who has testers scattered throughout the world with every handset/carrier combination imaginable.Â  They also have a web based defect tracking and collaboration platform.Â  So with a simple phone call and a very low cost, we set up and executed a three day test that covered most of the major phones, from smart phones to basic mobile devices, and across numerous carriers.Â  In addition, we loaded up on testers who lived in the areas close to the retailers who would be using this service.Â  This gave us mass coverage of devices and carriers for an extremely low cost and over a very short window of time.Â  Agile, cost effective, and efficient!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>
<p>These are just three examples of how the cloud is changing testing forever.Â  All three of these scenarios can be tested in the cloud regardless if the actual solution to be tested was built in the cloud or on-premise.Â  Even if you are building your solution on-premise, you can still do the initial prototyping on the cloud to figure our how much CPU and memory you need to buy.Â  Many of both SOASTA&#8217;s and UTest&#8217;s customers have on-premise solutions.Â  So even if your company fears the cloud as a solution for deploying applications and building data centers, there is no excuse for continuing to spend way too much time and money testing things the &#8220;way we have always done it&#8221;.</p>

	<p>As I have mentioned in numerous posts over the last several months, I am finding that things like process, governance, architecture, SOA, cloud computing, and others are much easier in my new startup world than in my old corporate world that I battled in since the 80&#8242;s.  Even though I never intend to return to the corporate world I feel obligated to share with my colleagues in the corporate world because I know how hard it can be innovate and promote change in established cultures.  In <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=1674">part one on process</a>, I recommended creating a startup atmosphere by building a small team free from the constraints of the corporate setting.</p>
<p>In this post I will focus on roadmaps.Â  Whether you are building a roadmap for you overall architecture, for a portfolio of projects within a given domain of your architecture, or for reengineering business processes, roadmapping can be a challenge because of large amounts of legacy systems and ingrained behavior.Â  Many roadmapping exercises start with a long process of capturing the current state.Â  Often this leads to analysis paralysis and lots of time and money is spent while nobody is building the future state.</p>
<p><strong>WWSD?</strong></p>
<p>What would a startup do?Â  Well, a startup&#8217;s current state is that they have a blank sheet of paper and an opportunity to build the best possible solution with no legacy constraints.Â  Hmm, doesn&#8217;t that sound attractive?Â  I wrote a post back in 2007 called <a href="http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/?p=204">Getting to Future State</a> where I recommended designing the future state first and then capture the current state later.Â  <strong>The reason is simple, if you start with the current state you immediately constrain the innovation process for future state.Â  Why not start with the perfect world and work back instead of starting with an imperfect world and adding to it?</strong><br />

<strong>Starting with current state can create undesirable results</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ngxRvtzN24K009XiZ2X-s7eekyve-7PKPAOWTmHqJD8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_0oE0MdUg0nE/S9-A9T_a_TI/AAAAAAAAD5w/C0EwVwq78gQ/s400/future-state.png" alt="" /></a><br />
<strong>Starting with future state can increase your chances for a desirable outcome</strong></p>
<p>WWSD?Â  A good startup would map out what it wants to be when it grows up first and then work towards that goal while carefully managing its precious resources and capital.Â  A startup will also deliver early and often because it has to generate revenue, customer interest, and investor enthusiasm before it goes broke.Â  That is exactly what a corporation should do!Â  Deliver early and often making incremental improvements and proving its value to the executives (corporate equivalent of investors).</p>
<p>I have seen and been involved in too many promising projects where the next new technology, process, or organizational change was going to solve all of the world&#8217;s problems.Â  Each time these initiatives fell short of expectations and each time these new solutions were just another layer on top of the last solution.Â  Each layer added a new layer of complexity and legacy on top of the previous layer.Â  The reason for this is these teams started with what existed and figured out how to &#8220;wire in&#8221; the next technology, instead of figuring out how to move off or abstract parts of the legacy systems in order to take advantage of the newer technologies.</p>
<p>So the next time you have a roadmapping exercise, don&#8217;t start by analyzing what exists.Â  Start with a blank sheet of paper and ask &#8220;If we were a startup and were starting business today, what would the future state look like?&#8221;Â  Once you define what the perfect world looks like, then figure out how to get there.Â  You will likely find that you will have to make some sacrifices here and there but at least your innovative thinking was unconstrained when you envisioned the future state!</p>

	<p>I have spent well over 20 years in corporate IT environments, most of it working for IT shops in the 100-300 person range.  In every company that I worked for, IT was seen as a bottleneck and IT struggled to satisfy the needs of the business.  In many companies, this is the standard.  The reasons for these struggles can be boiled down into the following categories:</p>
<p>1) Process &#8211; Too much, too little, or the wrong process for the organization<br />
2) Architecture &#8211; No focus on EA (&#8220;Wild West&#8221;), vendor driven, or Ivory Tower Syndrome<br />
3) Culture &#8211; Silos, change resistant, IT thought as a cost center, wrong or unmotivated people<br />
4) Priorities &#8211; No portfolio type thinking, decisions made at the wrong level, lack of accountability/justification</p>
<p>In the last 18 months, I have worked in a startup with aÂ  team of 10+ employees advisors, partners, and consultants.  Many of the above issues are not a problem in our environment for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) Process &#8211; Teams are small, easy to communicate, everybody depends on everyone else<br />
2) Architecture &#8211; We see architecture as both a necessity and a competitive advantage<br />
3) Culture &#8211; Survival depends on alignment, agility, and change<br />
4) Priorities &#8211; Every penny spent better contribute in some way towards a penny earned</p>
<p>Established organizations can usually survive and sometimes thrive even despite their deficiencies in IT because their core business is bringing in sufficient revenue.  For startups, I have seen some great business models fail because of the company&#8217;s inability to execute.  Startups, especially those in early stages, rarely succeed if they are inefficient.  So how can larger, established companies create that entrepreneurial environment that brings the same motivation, accountability, and alignment that comes naturally in startups?</p>
<p><strong>What does success look like?</strong></p>
<p>Often, companies like to create a profile of their most successful employees so they can use this profile as a hiring tool for identifying talent that matches the best people in the company.  I recommend that any company who recognizes that it needs to make changes to improve delivery and business/IT alignment create a profile for what a successful startup looks like.  Notice I did not say what a successful well established company looks like.  The reason is simple.  Startups typically deliver frequently, with little capital, with just enough features, and with more modern solutions.  Isn&#8217;t that what established companies really want at the end of the day?</p>
<p><strong>So why do startups tend to move faster and innovate more?</strong></p>
<p>1) Smaller teams<br />
2) Better communication/alignment<br />
3) Smaller budgets = less features and shorter deadlines<br />
4) Employee incentives (survival) are directly tied to results<br />
5) Everybody matters, everybody contributes<br />
6) Not married to legacy systems, processes, cultures<br />
7) Everybody sees the big picture</p>
<p>So how can leaders in IT create this kind of environment that fits the profile of so many successful startups?  Transforming an entire organization can be an ominous task.  We have seen many companies fail implementing new technologies because of the inability to change the culture.  It takes buy in at the highest levels and great transformational leadership to change a company&#8217;s culture and motivation.  Maybe the solution is simpler.Â   Create a &#8220;startup&#8221; within your organization and ask yourself, &#8220;What would a startup do?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>WWSD?</strong><br />
A good startup would build a business plan that shows investors what it will build, how it will generate revenue, how it will keep its burn rate to a minimum, how it will deliver quickly, and why it is better than the competition.  Then the startup would build a small team with its limited funds and create extremely aggressive goals and targets that are back loaded with incentives for employees pending on the outcome of their delivery and future funding.  Then the team would be empowered to do whatever it takes to meet those deliverables within the limits of the existing funds and resources.Â  In a startup, it takes a certain mentality for an IT person to survive and thrive in this type of environment.Â  Make sure that only those types of people are included in this internal startup.Â  It only takes one corporate attitude to destroy a startup.</p>
<p>To meet the commitments, team members will have to heavily rely on one another.  They will also need to innovate to figure out how to balance features, functionality, and quality.  Decisions will need to be made quickly and documentation will have to be just enough.  In my startup we call this <strong>JEJIT </strong>- <strong>J</strong>ust <strong>E</strong>nough, <strong>J</strong>ust <strong>I</strong>n <strong>T</strong>ime.  Our requirements and design documents are more visual than textual.  You won&#8217;t see any 150 page requirements documents because nobody has the time to create it.  Instead you will see an iterative process where we get just enough requirements to throw a prototype together.  Then we show the prototype to the product owner and iterate through changes until the requirements are good enough for a demo.Â  The first slide of the following presentation shows how we iterate through each phase.</p>

</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0 12px">The second slide shows how we set weekly deliverables and chip away at our deadline each week.Â  This process allows us to get the process flows up running quickly so we can flush out the requirements.Â  Once we feel good about the flow, we put a enough of a user interface on it to show it to people.Â  The real user interface requirements come as people start using the demo and giving us feedback.Â  We also quickly learn when we have enough features to satisfy the immediate needs.Â  A 150 page document listing all of the possible features usually leads to the user demanding most or all of it.Â  With a limited feature rich user interface that shows the workflow (we call it the plumbing), the user will probably only ask for just the features they need because they can&#8217;t wait to get their hands on the workflow that you just showed them.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0 12px">What I just described is just an example of the process my company put in place.Â  It is agile in nature, but by no means is what purists would call Agile Development.Â  I do not need to enforce any new &#8220;by the book&#8221; methodology.Â  I did not need to send my team to training to learn how to be scrum masters.Â  I just surrounded myself with a few talented people with the right incentives and we all agreed that this is &#8220;how we roll&#8221;.Â  If the startup team helps define the process that they will use, they will not resist it.Â  They will own it and be proud of it.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0 12px"><strong>Other options</strong></div>
<div style="padding:5px 0 12px">Creating an internal startup is one option.Â  Another is acquiring, partnering, or investing in a startup that can deliver a specific product or service that the company needs.Â  This is a quicker method but could create all kinds of unhappiness internally when employees see this as a threat to their jobs.Â  Outsourcing is another option which comes with the same type of baggage.Â  I recommend trying the internal startup method.Â  Create a team that is isolated from all other projects, free to create new processes, free to use the right technologies for the job instead of what exists, and let them run with it.Â  If it works, repeat it with another group.Â  Continue doing so until you have created an entrepreneurial environment.</div>
<div style="padding:5px 0 12px"><strong>Summary</strong></div>
<div style="padding:5px 0 12px">After 3 decades of corporate life, my last 18 months in a startup has showed me how innovative and what a great partner IT can be to the business.Â  Sometimes at night I ask myself, &#8220;If I went back to the corporate world (God forbid), what would I do differently to capture the spirit, agility, and innovation that my startup has.Â  My answer is, ask WWSD?</div>
