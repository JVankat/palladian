line-height:150%;font-family:Arial">On December 18, 2010, Mitchell County Sheriff�s Deputies responded to a call of illegal drug activity in the area of McHone Road. The caller advised they had observed two people in a maroon Ford Tarsus injecting drugs with a syringe. &nbsp;Detective J.D. Holmes located the vehicle near the intersection of McHone Road and Swiss Pine Lake Road. When the operator of the vehicle observed Detective Holmes, he started traveling towards NC 226. Detective Holmes stopped the vehicle in the parking lot of Mitchell Veterinary Clinic. Captain R.V. Wiseman, Lieutenant J.D. English, and Deputy S.E. DAVIS arrived to assist Detective Holmes. The operator of the vehicle was identified as Ronlesley Smith, age 26, of 285 Lincoln Park Road, Burnsville, N.C. The passenger was identified as Adam Ray Mathis, age 26, of 426 Meadowood Lane, Burnsville, N.C. Detective Holmes observed Smith getting out of the car and lifting up the floor mat. Detective Holmes ordered Smith to stop and place his hands on the car. Smith kept on placing his hand in his right front pants pocket. Detective Holmes grabbed Smith�s hand and pulled it from his pocket. As Smith�s hand came out of his pocket, he dropped a five dollar on the ground. Wrapped up in the five dollar were one and half 30-milligram Oxycodone pills. Deputy Davis removed Mathis from the car and during the pat down of Mathis; he located two syringes in Mathis right sock. Both of the syringes were loaded with a crusted up Oxycodone pill and water according to Mathis. Captain Wiseman and Detective Holmes located more syringes in the vehicle.

They must remove snow, slush and ice so people can pass-by safely, or face a $50 fine per day, up to $5,000. The city will begin enforcement by responding to complaints and issuing warnings.

Department of Transportation crews were able to make more progress than anticipated in cleaning up the Christmas Day storm over most of North Carolina, although fresh snowfall in the western and northeastern counties complicated cleanup in those areas. Snow fell over the weekend in all 100 counties in North Carolina, with some counties seeing only a trace while others received more than 18 inches. NCDOT called in all its work crews from their Christmas holidays to carry out the cleanup, supplemented by private contractors in most parts of the state.&nbsp; Most roads throughout the state will be cleared by Tuesday afternoon, but cleanup will extend into some areas into Wednesday and, in remote mountain counties, late in the week. &nbsp;Western counties were hit with up to five additional inches late Sunday, adding to the heavy snowfall already on the ground and causing crews to replow routes they already had cleared. Some northeastern counties received as much as 10 to 15 inches late Sunday. Major interstates in most places are riding at normal speeds; however some require drivers to travel slower than the posted speed limit. People still need to be cautious and look out for patches of black ice Tuesday morning and, for the next couple of days, icy spots especially in shady areas. NCDOT encourages motorists to �know before they go� about road conditions by calling 511, the state�s toll-free travel information line.</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span class="apple-style-span"><b><span style="line-height: 115%; color: black"><font size="3">Motorists Urged to Use Caution</font></span></b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">12/27/10</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Snow-covered highways have caused wrecks throughout western, central and eastern North Carolina.

Chief Deputy Thomas L. Farmer stated the scam involves an elderly victim being contacted by someone who identifies themselves as one of their grandchildren. The caller is very convincing, often knowing information about the victim�s family, including relative�s names, birthdays and other personal information. The caller often claims to be in Europe or Canada. They explain they are in jail and need money fast to be released or post a bond. They instruct the victim to wire money to them. The victim, thinking they are helping a relative in distress, then wires money to where the caller instructed which is often alleged to be a county jail or detention facility. The result is the loss of thousands of dollars from the victim. The perpetrator may call more than once and may instruct the victim not to tell other relatives about the transaction.</font></span><font size="2"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial"> Chief Deputy Farmer stated that a recent incident did occur in Yancey County and an elderly grandmother wired money to an address believing that she was sending the money to post bond for her grandson when in fact he was not in jail but rather in class at college as he was supposed to be. Farmer stated that the money was received at a location overseas and was a fraudulent scam. To avoid being a victim, if you get a call, don�t send money without getting in touch with other family members to confirm the whereabouts of the grandchild or other family member. Farmer stated that law enforcement officers are not certain how scammers are getting the phone numbers of grandparents or family information. Local law enforcement agencies have few resources to deal with international crimes therefore warning residents as often as possible is the best way to combat scams. </span></font><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;

The Feldspar Corp. is claiming economic obsolesce due to the current economic downturn. Mitchell County tax assessor Blair Hyder told the commissioners that the difference in taxes collected by the county by denying the tax appeal would be about $12,000, or several million in appraised personal property values. Feldspar representative Judith Ross stated in a letter to Hyder that �There is substantial over-capacity in this industry that adversely impacts the value of the The Feldspar Corp.�s property.�&nbsp; She emphasized that this is not a short termed problem or related exclusively to management decisions, but rather it reflects the company�s inability to utilize its assets due to economic conditions. But a property valuation specialist with the NC Department of Revenue agreed with Hyder�s conclusions stating that the presence of another similar facility in the county which is not experiencing the same reduced activity shows that management decisions and not solely external forces determine how the plants are operating. The Feldspar Corp. and its sister company in Mitchell County, KT Fledspar, are owned by French based company Imerys. </font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:150%"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:

Department of Transportation is taking steps to help motorists save both time and money this Thanksgiving by suspending most road construction activities on major routes across the state. By avoiding traffic delays, motorists can reach their destinations more quickly while also cutting down on fuel consumption and costs. Here are a few tips to help make your trip safe and efficient: Leave early to get a head start on your drive---Travel at non-peak hours when possible---Stay alert. Even if work is suspended, you may encounter narrowed lanes and traffic shifts in work zone areas---Be patient and obey the posted speed limit.---Use alternate routes, when possible, to avoid traffic congestion. To help reduce fuel consumption and save money...Use cruise control. Using cruise control on 10,000 miles driven in a year could save you nearly $200 and save more than 60 gallons of fuel...Remove unnecessary items. That may add unnecessary weight to your vehicle...Keep your tires properly inflated and your car maintained, NCDOT reminds motorists to watch signs for construction information, stay alert and obey the posted speed limit. </font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial"><b>Woman Robbed at Church</b></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left"><font face="Arial">11/19/10</font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left"><font face="Arial">A secretary at Higgins Memorial Methodist Church in Burnsville was robbed at gun point Friday, November 19th the Burnsville Police Department reports.

Officials say restaurateurs in other states have reported receiving calls from people claiming to be health inspectors or other government officials who tell the business owners of a new inspection procedure. The phony �government official� provides a numeric code and instructs the restaurant operator to provide this confirmation code when prompted during an automated call or give the code to a health inspector who is scheduled to visit the restaurant in the near future. According to Allen Hughes, Toe River Health District Environmental Health Supervisor, the scams involve setting up �verified� accounts with a national online auction service. The purpose of the code is to get the restaurant to provide false verification which the scammer uses to establish a bogus online account to be used in other fraud schemes. Although there have been no reports of phony inspectors at any establishment targeted by the scam in North Carolina, food service establishments and other business owners need to be aware and never provide personal or business information by phone to an unknown caller and always ask for proper ID when dealing with inspectors. Businesses should immediately contact local law enforcement if they suspect they are being targeted by a scam. </p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Harrison Drops Protest</font></span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">11/18/10</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Spruce Pine Attorney Hal Harrison has dropped his protest of the Madison county vote in the 24<sup>th</sup> District Superior Court race and assistant District Attorney Gary Gavenus will take the seat of retiring Judge Jim Baker.&nbsp; Harrison said the canvass and recount have failed to reverse the vote totals in the race.&nbsp; There is an ongoing SBI investigation to determine if there was violation of law or criminal misconduct in the Madison County Board of elections office. </font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="arial"><b>2 Life Terms for Killing Parents</b></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="arial">11/17/10 </font><FONT face="arial" size="2"><b><a target="_blank" href="http://00607ac.netsolhost.com/audio/2010/News/Pics/Edward%20Montgomery%20Colyer.jpg"><img border="0" src="../gifs/Photo.gif" width="58" height="20"></a></b></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="arial">A Yancey County man has received two consecutive life sentences for killing his parents in the home he shared with them in January 2010. 50 year old Edward Montgomery Colyer was convicted of the January murder of his parents.

Harrison has called for a recount of the vote in the 24th judicial district election of Superior Court judges. Yancey County Elections Director Loretta Robinson said she received a memo from the State Board of Elections calling for a vote recount to begin at 8:30 Wednesday morning. Robinson stated that she did not expect the numbers to change and that Yancey County was just following the rules that govern the recount process. Yancey will join Mitchell, Avery, Madison and Watauga Counties, which make up the 24th judicial district, in the recount. Harrison protested the results of the November 2 election after election staff at two Madison County precincts inadvertently failed to include one-stop early voting numbers in their totals. When those 1,100 ballots were later included in the tally, Judge Phil Guinn was still the winner but Harrison had apparently lost the remaining seat to Assistant District Attorney Gary Gavenus. The law states that a candidate shall have the right to demand a recount of the votes if the difference between the votes for that candidate and the votes for a prevailing candidate is not more than one percent (1%) of the total votes cast in the ballot. Unofficial totals had Harrison losing to Gavenus by only 135 votes. Results of the recount should be available by Friday.</p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">Vote Canvass not completed in Madison</font></span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">11/15/10</font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif"><font size="2">The Madison County Board of Elections recessed Friday afternoon without completing its planned canvass of the election results, based on a protest filed by Spruce Pine attorney Hal G. Harrison. Harrison, a candidate in the 24th judicial district election of Superior Court judges protested the results of the election through his attorney Bob Long. Long argued that �a violation of election law or irregularity or misconduct has occurred.� He stated that �the manner in which the votes were counted and results tabulated� caused Harrison to receive the lowest number of votes after earlier; unofficial tallies suggested he was one of the two winners for a seat on the Superior Court. The district attorney for the 24th Judicial District said Thursday that he has asked state and federal authorities to investigate allegations of irregularities in the election. The challenges came after election staff at two Madison County precincts inadvertently failed to include one-stop early voting numbers in their totals. When those 1,100 ballots were later included, Harrison had apparently lost to Assistant District Attorney Gary Gavenus.

The request came after final and unofficial tallies on the vote in Madison County changed sharply from the numbers that had been announced on election night. Officials initially said&nbsp; that the problem occurred because election staff at two precincts inadvertently failed to include one-stop early voting numbers in their totals. The unofficial vote count released on election night showed sitting Judge Phil Guinn as the winner, while Mitchell County attorney Hal Harrison came in second just 78 votes in front of third place finisher Assistant District Attorney Gary Gavenus.

Students, with the help of instructors and professional trade workers, provide the work and that helps them learn a trade. It took $800-thousand to build the massive training facility.

Department of Transportation reminds motorists to be aware of the increased presence of deer on state roads during fall months. More than 19 thousand animal-related crashes were reported each of the last three years, and 90 percent of those involved deer. Since 2007, the incidents have resulted in 17 fatalities, over 33-hundred injuries to people and nearly $127 million in property damage. While a crash involving a deer can happen at any time, the majority of deer-vehicle collisions occur between the months of October and December, when deer activity increases due to mating and hunting seasons. Crashes are most common during the hours of 5 p.m. to 7 a.m., when deer movement increases and limited lighting makes it more difficult for motorists to see them on or near roadways. DOT Officials say people need to understand that often a worse crash occurs when a driver swerves to avoid the deer in the roadway. This reaction can cause the driver to hit another car head-on or run off the road. It is better to hit the deer than to lose control of your vehicle and hit a tree or someone else head on.</p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>Dogs are being Poisoned in Mitchell County</b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">10/07/2010&nbsp; <FONT face="arial" size="2"><a target="_blank" href="http://00607ac.netsolhost.com/audio/2010/News/100710lnthu1.mp3"><img border="0" src="Audio.gif" width="60" height="25"></a></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:left">The Mitchell County Humane Society says dogs are being poisoned, at least 14 in the past few months.

The scam involves a group of individuals, using a hacked e-mail and/or I.P. address, cutting and pasting pages of instructions, forms and agreements for purchasing a vehicle, boat, motorcycle or camper from a legitimate Website like eBay or Yahoo to their own site. The scammer lists the item for sale at a price usually much less than the market value complete with photos of the item for sale. The innocent buyer and scammer trade e-mails discussing the sale price and shipping details, and the scammer will usually ask the buyer to wire money using Western Union. The scammer will then follow up with subsequent e-mails asking for additional money for transportation, insurance and shipping cost. Once the money is sent, the innocent buyer does not hear from the scammer again, the innocent buyer is unable to get the money back and the item for sale is never shipped.<br><br>Yancey County Chief Deputy Tom Farmer says eBay scams have been very successful in robbing local residents of money. Scam artists activate sites outside of eBay pretend to be eBay agents or sellers.

And ask the user to send the money to an eBay agent.

Mission will now add photos to ID badges given to visitors. Visitors are already required to check in, provide their name and where they are going, and obtain an identification badge at night. The latest measure asks late-night visitors to show a photo ID that can be scanned or have their photo taken for the badge, which is good for 24 hours. No other personal information is recorded, and the badges are not necessary for people in the emergency department waiting area. Mission Hospital spokeswoman Merrell Gregory said there was nothing that triggered the change, but the photo IDs are intended to prevent any serious incident from occurring in the future. More than 200 people visit the hospital's two campuses each night.

Recognized for its outstanding beauty and unique cultural features, the route begins on N.C. 128 in Yancey County atop Mount Mitchell, the highest peak in the eastern United States with an altitude of 6,684 feet and one of 16 peaks over 6,000 feet tall which make up the Black Mountain Range. From the park, the scenic drive follows the Blue Ridge Parkway, which offers expanding vistas of the Black Mountains. The drive then descends into the South Toe River Valley, continuing into Burnsville and dropping some 4,500 feet in elevation. Homesteads, farms, pastures, churches and small communities dot the landscape in this rural area of Yancey and Madison counties. Visitors may also notice colorful squares hanging on the sides of barns and businesses along the route; part of the Quilt Trails of Western North Carolina project, these blocks represents different quilting patterns that reflect the heritage of the place where they are located. The byway ends at the intersection of U.S. 19/23 and Interstate 26 north of Mars Hill.

Pierpoint had served his 17 years at the Avery-Mitchell Correctional Facility near Spruce Pine.</p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><FONT face="Arial" size="2"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Paying on Line</b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left">07/08/2010</p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left">A new system for paying most waivable traffic tickets and related costs online is now statewide. The system was launched as a pilot in March 2010 and is now processing an average of about $24,000 per day, which has kept nearly 4,700 people from standing in line at county courthouses. The web-based system was custom-built and implemented in each county by the judicial branch�s N.C. Administrative Office of the Courts (NCAOC) in collaboration with a third-party receipt processing company. Overall, N.C. courts handle the payment of more than half a million waivable offense citations (including traffic) per year. In fiscal year 2008-2009, more than 644,000 of these waivable offense citations were paid in the state. Payments may be made on a secure website at www.payNCticket.org and are processed by an independent third-party vendor. </p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><FONT face="Arial" size="2"><b><FONT face="arial" size="2"><Img src="http://www.wkyk.com/inc/img/line2.gif" width="400" height="6"></font></b></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b>Affordable Healthcare</b></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left">07/08/2010&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://00607ac.netsolhost.com/audio/2010/News/070810lnthu2.mp3"><img border="0" src="Audio.gif" width="60" height="25"></a></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Quality, affordable health care is easy to take for granted if you have access to it, but it's an enviable commodity for North Carolinians with pre-existing conditions, News Center reporter Stephanie Carson has the story.

Spruce Pine Fire Chief David Hughes said when the first units arrived at the scene, the structure was fully engulfed with fire coming from the roof. They were able to get pews and other equipment out of a church next door, but the church did sustain water damage. Hughes said because of perhaps a tractor-trailer load of insulation that has to be moved before the fire can be completely extinguished, there will be units on the scene most of the day and urges travelers to use caution in this area. Chief Hughes had special thanks to all of the fire and emergency personnel who came to help, it is greatly appreciated. Fire and emergency units from Spruce Pine, Parkway, Newdale, Burnsville, South Toe and Green Valley responded to the scene.

Currently the East Yancey facility is the only location that accepts motor oil and oil filters, this grant allows the program to be expanded to the Riverside and the South Toe sites. The grant will also help expand the collection of recyclables at the Bee Log and Pensacola sites. Currently these sites do not accept any recyclable goods, this grant will allow for the purchase of equipment for both centers to accept recyclables such as plastics, aluminum, and glass.
