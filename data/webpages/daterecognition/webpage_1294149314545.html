            was synonymously the best and most vile movie ever. Everything
            about the movie is 100% top-notch. The main character is John
            Creasy, played by Denzel Washington. Creasy, the character, ranks
            with or above almost every action hero in motion picture history;
            Washington, the actor, is well nigh flawless. The cinematography
            mixes the most tried-and-true traditional and modern camera work in
            a breathtaking style. In the process, it also invents a few new
            tricks. The dialogue was perfect. The casting was perfect.
            Everything was perfect. Add to that the fact that almost everything
            in the film actually happened, though not all at the same time, and
            the movie really hits home. Unfortunately, <a
            href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JN0W/ref=ase_conspiracyarc-20/104-8924776-1297547?v=glance&amp;s=dvd"
             title="Man On Fire (2004)" class="amz">Man On Fire</a> was
            intentionally designed to program millions of people. In a certain
            percentage of the population this movie will cause depression,
            paranoia, posttraumatic stress, and a myriad other negative
            emotions. Someone or some people behind the making of this movie
            knew that by utilizing advanced technology, they could destroy a
            certain number of persons&rsquo; minds for the short and/or long
            term. It is sheer insidious genius.
          </p>
          <h2>
            The Movie
          </h2>
          <p>
            <cite>Man On Fire</cite> begins with our hero, ex-intelligence
            officer John Creasy, Denzel Washington, being a washed-up has-been
            intent on drinking himself to death. When this proves too
            time-consuming, he opts to shoot himself in the head. For some
            reason the bullet doesn&rsquo;t fire. It is a lucky bullet. Shortly
            after, his retired intelligence friend, Rayburn played by
            Christopher Walken, gets him a job as a bodyguard in Mexico for a
            little girl name Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. She is the
            daughter of a Mexican father and his Anglo wife. Tragically,
            despite Creasy&rsquo;s best efforts, Pita is kidnapped. In the
            process, John Creasy kills two agents who appear to have been
            corrupt in some way.
          </p>
          <p>
            John Creasy has bonded with the young Pita, and he is devastated
            and racked with guilt after her kidnapping. The Mom is extremely
            angry, scared, and depressed. They try negotiating, but the
            kidnappers kill the little girl AND take the money. John Creasy,
            finding a new mission in life, investigates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ex-intel op, Creasy, meets a journalist who decides to help him
            in exchange for information. First he finds out that the kidnappers
            were in fact a criminal gang involved in all kinds of despicable
            enterprises. Creasy locates a gang lieutenant, duct-tapes his hands
            to a car steering wheel, and proceeds to cut off fingers, one at a
            time, using the heated car lighter to cauterize the wounds. After
            two fingers, he slices off an ear. When he gets more information on
            the kidnapping, he kills the gang member.
          </p>
          <p>
            John Creasy discovers that many people are involved. One is the
            negotiating task force chief. Further, the crooked chief has been
            known to steal money for hostages before, but is protected by
            American and Mexican officials, and lives in a compound. Creasy
            blows up a car, then gets to the chief and kills him, while
            &ldquo;coercing&rdquo; him into relaying more info. He also
            tortures the generals inside the criminal gang and finds out the
            remaining leaders of the gang are two evil brothers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creasy also figures out that Pita&rsquo;s Dad, portrayed by Marc
            Anthony, was involved. The Mother, Radha Mitchell&rsquo;s role,
            freaks out, and tells Creasy to kill her husband, or she will.
            Creasy takes out that lucky bullet that didn&rsquo;t fire when he
            tried to commit suicide, puts it into his gun, and hands the gun to
            the Dad, Anthony. Dad didn&rsquo;t think the girl would die. He is
            guilty of using his daughter for monetary gain. A lower act can
            hardly be imagined. Creasy tells Dad that the bullet might still be
            lucky, and that Fate or God might step in again. They don&rsquo;t,
            and Dad blows his own brains out, in divine justice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, Creasy finds one of the two brothers, Aurelio Sanchez. He
            corners Aurelio and his pregnant wife. Creasy is being watched and
            tracked at this point by sympathetic agents from both Mexico and
            America. Creasy beats Aurelio some, and then points a gun to his
            head. When Creasy forcefully questions the wife, she doesn&rsquo;t
            even hesitate to spill the beans. Yes, it is her husband, Aurelio,
            and his brother Daniel Sanchez who have kidnapped the girl. Creasy
            has her call the mysterious Daniel, the most evil character in the
            movie. Daniel admits that this is the worst thing that can happen:
            his family kidnapped and being threatened with their permanent
            loss. Creasy blasts off Aurelio&rsquo;s hand while the agents and
            Daniel are both listening. Aurelio screams and screams. Daniel
            realizes he has been put into the same place John Creasy was put
            into when Pita was taken - a true role-reversal. Creasy shooting
            off Aurelio&rsquo;s hand, the calm way he has heretofore carried
            out psychological abuse, physical torture, and murder, and his
            current uncompromising tone of voice; all tell Daniel Sanchez that
            there is no doubt as to whether he is about to have to bargain his
            own life to save his family. But wait&hellip;
          </p>
          <p>
            Daniel Sanchez says he will trade. Trade what? It is a life for a
            life. Creasy tells him he will settle for nothing less than
            Daniel&rsquo;s assassination and probable torture. Daniel
            startlingly reveals that the little girl is still alive! Creasy
            can&rsquo;t believe it, but without missing a beat, he agrees to
            give back Aurelio and Aurelio&rsquo;s pregnant wife in exchange for
            Pita. Creasy sets up a meeting place, heads over, and calls the
            Mother, a great performance by Mitchell. He tells Mom that Pita may
            still be alive, and heads out.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, the little girl gets saved, Aurelio dies, but Daniel
            and Aurelio&rsquo;s wife live.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last shot sees our hero, John Creasy, slowly dying from bullet
            wounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, I will say that in all senses, this movie was possibly the
            best ever made in a few different genres: action flicks,
            &ldquo;spy&rdquo; movies, dual-language films (floating rapidly
            back and forth from English to Spanish). Creasy&rsquo;s is perfect
            justice, and he is never flawed in choosing who should be tortured,
            how much, and who should die. Yet, still, <cite>Man On Fire</cite>
            was designed to make some people go insane.
          </p>
          <p>
            I explained why it was so great. There are many, many levels such
            as the soundtrack, the cinematography, the script, the acting
            &ndash; almost every facet. Now hear me out as I tell you why this
            movie was designed to be horrifyingly detrimental to the global
            society.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Stress and the Brain
          </h2>
          <p>
            First, in the beginning of the film, Creasy&rsquo;s attempted
            suicide brings out some sort of primal fear of death. For those who
            don&rsquo;t believe that fear messes with actual centers in the
            brain, that it doesn&rsquo;t change brain chemistry, that it
            doesn&rsquo;t have lasting effects, you are refuting science.
            Science Central News reported some recent discoveries in a June 24,
            2003 article entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.salesbrain.net/articles/ScienCentral%20Stress%20Changes%20Your%20Brain.htm" title="Stress Changes Your Brain">Stress Changes Your Brain</a>&rdquo;. SCN:
            &ldquo;We all have a little stress in our lives. But after studying
            nerve cells in a banana-shaped area of the brain called the
            hippocampus, a hub for learning and memory, neuroscientists say
            chronic stress can have devastating effects on our brains.&rdquo;
            Scientist Bruce McEwen said the hippocampus is important and
            &ldquo;provides context&rdquo; for important events. Science
            postulates that the hippocampus is highly stimulated in most people
            during intense events, like 9-11, thus creating permanent images.
            It works in extreme positive and negative situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="http://www.affordablerx.com/"
            title="http://www.affordablerx.com/">AffordableRX</a>&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;Health Section&rdquo; states that stress in the brain,
            activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
            (grouping), causes great damage. This stress causes &ldquo;High
            Blood Pressure (hypertension), loss of appetite, weight loss,
            muscle wasting, GI ulcers, loss of reproductive function,
            suppression of the immune system, and depression.&rdquo; The
            Franklin Institute Online adds: &ldquo;A chronic overreaction to
            stress overloads the brain with powerful hormones that are intended
            only for short-term duty in emergency situations. Their cumulative
            effect damages and kills brain cells.&rdquo; From Future Pundit:
            &ldquo;Researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered that sudden
            emotional stress can also result in severe but reversible heart
            muscle weakness that mimics a classic heart attack.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you loved the movie and were completely sympathetic to John
            Creasy&rsquo;s actions, can all of you honestly say that this
            intensely dark and violent movie didn&rsquo;t stimulate internal
            stress? If so, you should be working for the CIA yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, even if you are a part of the percentage who
            doesn&rsquo;t get stressed when you watch grotesque acts committed
            on film, some are adversely stimulated. Other factors come into
            play, and the stress level is constantly intensified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going on from Creasy&rsquo;s attempted suicide, the little girl is
            captured. This stirs a deep primal emotion, a fear that is not
            named. There are only a few things worse than having your child
            kidnapped. And, the way <cite>Man On Fire</cite> was shot, you are
            right inside the film. Fear is the primary agent used in
            information gathering, brainwashing, mind controlling, and a
            plethora of other unsavory acts, especially when used to dominate
            or coerce. NPR&rsquo;s Ira Flatow gives an online streaming oral
            dissertation called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4486533" title="">Making False Memories</a>&rdquo;. He begins
            by telling us that cops and prosecutors know that many memories are
            totally, unknowingly fabricated. Studies have been done to
            corroborate this. A John Hopkins scientist is interviewed, and adds
            that creating false memories in the lab are very easily, and
            regularly, done. Stress can quicken the fabricated memory process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Directly after the kidnapping, we have Creasy cutting off and
            burning the gang-bangers fingers. This brings additional sharply
            intense fear. By this point in the movie, chemicals are sparking
            off in the brain like a meteor storm in a beach&rsquo;s night sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next you get a man blown up by having C4 being inserted inside his
            rectum. If every man deserved what he received from Creasy, people
            would not watch this incredibly graphic movie. Because of the
            script, we admire John Creasy and his justice, and thus keep
            watching. The deep-rooted emotions continue firing synapses in
            dynamic patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another level of subconscious ripple is created with the cutting
            dialogue. Creasy shows no mercy, and psychologically tortures the
            evildoers as well as physically so. Waves and waves of fear, anger,
            and hatred occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two more men killed and tortured, and the flashing strobe
            sequencing begins. This flashing is done in sporadic patterns.
            Pfwooof&hellip;Pfwooofpfwoooof!&hellip;
            Pfwoof&hellip;Pfwoofpfwooofpfwoooof!&hellip; It is constant and
            unyielding. The flashing lasts for the final 30 or 45 minutes of
            the movie. This strobing is juxtaposed with jumping screen shots,
            definitely a new or drastically refined video technique. The
            flashing lights are another method used by torturers, most notably
            American and British intelligence. The FBI, CIA, MI6 have all
            admitted to using strobes, and our Neo-con leaders continue to
            endorse the technique with almost no outcry from the Democrats.
            Inside of <cite>Man On Fire</cite>, this effect starts to hypnotize
            the viewer, while reptilian emotions are swimming in his or her
            subconscious, pushing the fear deeper still.
          </p>
          <p>
            This constant negative emotion is relentless; as the Father is
            revealed as one of the kidnappers and commits suicide, as Daniel
            Sanchez has the tides turned with his own family being the tortured
            hostages, we are happy and aghast at the same time, a double shot
            of diametrically opposed emotions. Add to this Creasy&rsquo;s sharp
            tone of voice, and we have another level of mental control. The
            American Psychological Association admitted that voices create
            chemical reactions in the brain on February 3, 2005. The title of
            the article says it all: &ldquo;<a href="http://thestressoflife.com/brain_increases_response_when_he.htm"

            Then, hope&hellip; The little girl being alive draws us from our
            sedation and stupor. This hope is quickly depressed to the lowest
            depths yet with a realization of something worse than kidnapping.
            If the little girl is alive, then most intelligent people will know
            what would have happened to her. She would have been raped in ways
            too morbid to describe. This is never said, but only the densest
            person would not think it for a moment. How could someone? Why
            would someone? More fear, more stress.

            But, Pita is saved. In the end, Aurelio is killed. So, too, is John
            Creasy. This is the very last shot of the film. John Creasy has
            become loved by the audience as the perfect judge and jury,
            flawless and justified. Our hero dies. By leaving us on this
            sadness, we are never raised out of our state of depression, yet we
            are somehow happy.

            There are other things that more deeply enhance the instinctive
            brain responses. The subtitles in English stroll across the screen
            in different directions, or just appear, in various designs. The
            music that is juxtaposed over the movie is excellent, but
            entrancing, lulling the brain into deeper and deeper state of
            shock. It&rsquo;s druidic, hypnotic, yet beautiful and enchanting.
            The Richards Institute of Education and Research admits,
            &ldquo;Exploring the neurobiology of music, researchers discovered
            direct evidence that music stimulates specific regions of the brain
            responsible for memory, motor control, timing and language. For the
            first time, researchers also have located specific areas of mental
            activity linked to emotional responses to music.&rdquo; All these
            factors and more play into this piece of mind-destroying celluloid.

            OK. So you are ready to admit that stress responses create a
            multitude of adverse effects in the brain and body. But, you
            don&rsquo;t see that there is a connection with this and the
            creators&rsquo; intent. There are several indicators that finger

            best essays I&rsquo;ve ever read on the government&rsquo;s use of
            media for control of the masses, published in full online. It was a
            2004 college dissertation paper by David B. Deserano dubbed
            &ldquo;<a

             title="Information Control For Social Manipulation">Information
            Control For Social Manipulation</a>&rdquo;. It was fully footnoted,
            for those who want sources. Deserano: &ldquo;In no way is this
            intended to convince readers of any particular conspiracy theory,
            but rather to present a collection of facts&hellip; The radio, the
            computer, and the Internet are all products of the military.&rdquo;
            The corporate American government gained much of their propaganda
            information from the Nazis such as Goebbels and Riefenstahl, and
            later incorporated research done by the infamous Edward Bernays.
            They were able to take the pacifistic U.S. public, remembering
            Washington&rsquo;s warning of &ldquo;entangling treaties,&rdquo;
            and make them fervent warmongers. Bernays&rsquo; partner, Walter
            Lippman, called it &ldquo;manufacturing consent.&rdquo; Deserano
            relays, &ldquo;On October 24, 1947, Walt Disney testified before
            the House Un-American Activities Committee that films could be used
            successfully as a tool of propaganda and admitted his studios had
            already made several propaganda pieces&hellip; In the 1950's, ABC,

            Rather, Tom Brokaw, or Diane Sawyer say that Saddam Hussein or
            Osama bin Laden are bad guys, the viewing audience just silently
            agrees; no evidence to support such claims are needed. However, if
            something out of the ordinary is told, something that contradicts
            common understanding, then the audience very rightly wants to know
            more.&rdquo; As we can see, the government has been studying and
            using media, and movies, to control thinking.

          <h2>
            An Unscientific Analysis
          </h2>
          <p>
            We should acknowledge that the government is trying to control our
            minds, even if you think they couldn&rsquo;t do it to you. We can
            agree that a certain percentage of the people are weak minded, and
            all these aforementioned effects will drive them a little crazy,
            similar to post traumatic stress. Let us be very conservative,
            though, and say <cite>Man On Fire</cite> pushed only 10% of the entire viewing
            audience into this state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the remaining 90%, half are conservative, half are liberal. The
            conservatives came out of this movie putting it at the top of their
            lists. They loved the movie: they loved what John Creasy did and
            why he did it. They were floating on air.
          </p>
          <p>
            The liberals were slightly despondent, and understood that this
            was, minimally, a propaganda piece designed to make torture, which
            most of the new Bush appointees are on record approving of,
            acceptable to the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what of the 10% that went partially insane due to stress? How
            many people saw that movie? 100 million? More? Again, with a
            worldwide blockbuster and award-nominated film, 100 million is
            conservative, but we will again err on the side of caution. If this
            is true, 10 million people were negatively affected by this movie.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this was the intent of the movie, to make 10 million people
            stressed to the point of a jolting mental shift, are not the
            creators themselves evil? Even amongst the vast amount of
            conservatives, I bet that less than 10% could actually say, at this
            very moment, that they are 100% positive they could conduct the
            acts that Creasy perpetrated. The other half - the liberals - while
            not being stultified by the movie, were changed in some way. And
            while this 90% of the audience won&rsquo;t admit it, most were
            affected on some deep, subconscious level in an adverse way. To not
            be so would make one Godless and soulless. Yes, it was right for
            Creasy to do what he did. But, who would really want to be him?
            Remember, you must give your life and brutally torture others to
            save one girl, who will be damaged for life because of what has
            been done to her. You will commit acts that most of you have never
            committed, or even thought about much. If you could do this, then
            go do it. There are plenty of kidnappings, everyone concedes. Where
            are you? Even the CIA knows that 99% of the population would never
            be able to do it. Even the 1% pre-dispositioned to commit such
            difficult tasks must be trained, giving up a little piece of
            themselves in the training and doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It must also be remembered that many tortures are perpetuated
            against innocent people.
          </p>
          <h2>
            The Bushes and Sex
          </h2>
          <p>
            It should be re-noted that John Creasy is only loosely based on a
            real person. The Denzel Washington movie is adapted from a previous
            movie adapted from a book. And the incidents are a conglomeration
            of different operations occurring in Italy, not Mexico. This seems
            to be a classic case of intelligence working inside the publishing
            and movie industries. The case of Jeff Gannon comes to mind. Jeff
            Gannon under an alias was in the inner-circle of White House
            journalists daily asking President George W. Bush softball
            questions. He is also a male homosexual prostitute, primarily
            whoring out to military men, or attempting to through several
            websites. Despite all the questions that arise over the Gannon
            case, there is a primary one: HOW did a homosexual prostitute use a
            fake name, a fake news service, pose as a journalist, and make it
            past the vetting of the White House publicity staff during
            wartime!?
          </p>
          <p>
            This did happen. Is it not possible that the author of the book and
            the makers of the movie <cite>Man On Fire</cite> deliberately
            etched together half true stories for some nefarious reason?
          </p>
          <p>
            And while we&rsquo;re on the subject of homosexuality in the Bush
            White House, we should further explore the Bushes and their sexual
            predilections. Noted journalist Alexander Cockburn, Alex Jones, and
            others reported that a culture of homosexuality is prevalent at
            Bohemian Grove Club meetings. Clan Bush is a member. Ron Rosenbaum,
            Anthony Sutton, and many others have reported that members of the
            Skull &amp; Bones Yale fraternity masturbate in front of their
            &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; while revealing sexual histories. Both Bush
            Presidents are members of S&amp;B. Henry Makow, PhD, David Lindorf
            and many others wrote that George H. Bush had a secretary/mistress
            that accompanied him when he went to China. She was later given a
            cushy job. New York Post and other journals relayed the fact that
            Neil Bush, brother to the current President, accepted female Asian
            prostitutes in Hong Kong. This is admitted in his divorce
            depositions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wonder what we don&rsquo;t know about the Bushes?
          </p>
          <h2>
            Reasons For Control
          </h2>
          <p>
            Finally, we must ask why the government would use movies and media
            to control the mind. In the case of <cite>Man On Fire</cite>, Big
            Pharma fingerprints are evident. We have established that stressful
            films cause adverse chemical and biological effects in the human
            brain and body. It is also fact that the Corporate Government knows
            this, has infiltrated media, and utilized their knowledge. Many
            scientists and scientific journals assert that many people who are
            stimulated in such a way become mentally ill in the short and long
            term. The Pharmaceutical wing of the government has been pushing
            mood-altering drugs like Ritalin, Prozac, and a dizzying array of
            other such patented chemicals. The FDA makes it nearly impossible
            for new drug makers to get their products approved. Americans who
            try to get cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe are threatened with
            imprisonment. George W. Bush and Congress&rsquo; new law,
            &ldquo;The Freedom Initiative&rdquo;, has created a slippery slope
            by mandating psychological evaluations for all children. Because of
            the intentional saturation of violence in the media, many kids will
            definitely be off-kilter, mentally. They will need drugs. These
            drugs may be given out for free, a gift from taxpayers. This money
            will go to the Pharmaceutical Agencies. Most national politicians
            and FDA board members own stock in Big Pharma. The connection is
            quite obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            A secondary purpose for movies like <cite>Man On Fire</cite> is to normalize
            torture. Among other White House cabinet members who are on record
            approving torture are Sec. of St. Alberto Gonzalez, Homeland
            Director Michael Chertoff, and by proxy the President. This film
            and its ilk are meant to desensitize the public to vile, formerly
            Axis country tactics. Of course, all countries have used torture in
            the past. But, the official line for the United States of America
            has always been that we do not sponsor or condone it. Arguments
            included the fact that you can&rsquo;t be morally superior when
            demanding that our captured troops not be tortured. It promotes
            anger in the enemy, and thus spawns exponential torture. It is now
            admitted that 70-90% of the tortured victims at Abu Ghraib and
            several other torture sites in Iraq were not involved in any
            terrorist group or violence against America. Some of the victims at
            Guantanamo Bay were Canadian and English. Both men and women have
            been raped with various objects in various orifices by American
            troops. Don&rsquo;t believe me? I&rsquo;m not going to devolve into
            gory details, but just use your own search engine. It&rsquo;s on
            record.
          </p>
          <p>
            By normalizing torture, we are refuting our humanitarian,
            spiritual, tolerant heritage! The control agents make the hero
            justified to keep you involved, to keep the synapses firing. This
            is not, nor should it ever have been, what the U.S.A. is about.
            I&rsquo;m not saying that torture could never be necessary to stop
            a catastrophic event. However, this is less than 1% of all torture
            cases. American citizens are beaten, shocked, and abused in our own
            prison system. Half the people in our own prison system never hurt
            anyone, or used violence; they just did drugs. This is not right.
            All but the worst of the worst deserve the right to life, liberty,
            and the pursuit of happiness without torture &ndash; and there is a
            Christian argument that everyone does. All the news has to do is
            say a person is a terrorist or vile criminal, and we shift into
            agreement. Yet, it is rarely the terrorist or vile criminal who is
            tortured. And still we are angry when Saddam, Hitler, or some rogue
            country utilizes the practice. What a double standard! Total
            programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the reasons we have not supported torture is that it is
            logical that evil men will use it on almost any enemy. You
            don&rsquo;t like the VA? Torture. Growing weed in your backyard?
            Torture. What of Christians who preach against homosexuality or
            abortion? Torture, torture, and more torture. Like Soviet Russia,
            if we continue on this course, soon those who disagree with the
            government will be tortured. The government, Corporations,
            Pharmaceuticals, and Military are all intermarried with Mainstream
            Media. Through that media, if you do anything that is currently
            under attack by the System, they will just say you are a terrorist,
            or killer, or whatever. Then, all the brainless masses will
            remember John Creasy, hear that you are a kidnapper, and they will
            be HAPPY you are being tortured. It&rsquo;s total control.

            Final Notes
          </h2>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m just a common man, not some intellectual, and I have
            discerned this blatant manipulation. I&rsquo;m sure there are many
            more levels to the propaganda. In the famous words of Bill Hicks,
            Jim Morrison, and others: &ldquo;WAKE UP!&rdquo; This is not right.
            We can&rsquo;t accept this. Turn off your TV. Better yet, throw it
            away. Learn what the slant of a movie is before you watch it. There
            are plenty of pro-liberty films out there by morally conscious
            directors. Turn off the AM radio. Spend your money on the Internet
            and learn some facts. Or, preferably, read books. We are being
            brainwashed with movies even while being admittedly dumbed-down in
            the schools. Take your kid out of the public school. We used to be
            a politically, socially, and spiritually aware society. Now
            we&rsquo;re slobbering idiots, saying &ldquo;Oh. <cite>Man On
            Fire</cite> was such a great movie. I love torturer John Creasy.
            And did you see his birth and death date at the end. It&rsquo;s a
            true story.&rdquo; (The author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060586109/ref=ase_conspiracyarc-20/104-8924776-1297547?v=glance&amp;s=books" title="Man on Fire" class="amz">the book</a>, A.J. Quinnell, claimed
            to have been unaware of the dates until after the movie came out.)
            Can&rsquo;t you learn about the true facts of kidnapping,
            corruption, and aspects of torture without taking in the pretty
            flashing lights? Do we really need to see sequence after sequence
            of base acts of death and destruction? Are some of you actually
            allowing your kids to watch this trash?
          </p>
          <p>
            I charge YOU, America, with being too apathetic to turn off the
            military/industrial complex&rsquo;s propaganda films. I charge you
            with accepting torture, but being too ignorant to learn the true
            facts behind it. I charge you with accepting the official line
            without question.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you, America, do not change, this country, as we know it, will
            soon be no more.
