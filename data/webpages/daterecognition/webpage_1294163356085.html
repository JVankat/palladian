<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tomato size=5><STRONG>W</STRONG></FONT><FONT color=tan>hat is the Grail? For many the Grail or �Holy Grail� symbolises �perfection� or a �state of excellence� and primarily in the spiritual and mystical sense. The symbol for the Grail is often a cup, chalice or vessel that one drinks from. The meaning is simple and clear; the cup symbolises one�s own sustenance or nourishment and this means in the <EM>spiritual</EM> context. Taking things to the highest level, the Grail really symbolises �enlightenment� and inner spiritual illumination � and there really is such an experience � an experience that has been behind the religious impulse of man throughout history. <BR><BR>In all the stories that feature the Grail, it is this experience that is always being alluded to along with the physical and internal psychical processes associated with it. One�s own realization of this is the �highest level� one can reach in regard to the knowledge and wisdom being imparted via this symbol of the Grail � again, traditionally a cup, chalice or vessel containing �All that is�. However, the Grail works on several levels of initiation, and there�s one level I would like to bring attention to here and which has never been �overtly� presented before.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>The �sudden appearance� of the Grail in the stories dedicated to it, is really associated with bringing attention to <EM>cyclical phenomena </EM>and for good reason, because knowledge of cycles and their three phases is paramount in understanding the dynamic processes underlying reality as linked to human consciousness and more importantly the attainment of enlightenment and gnosis of the spiritual source to which we are all connected. </FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>In-depth analysis of these stories reveal that in many different ways, the ancients were really conveying knowledge about cycles and more importantly, the crucial point in the cycle � known esoterically as the <EM>�Alpha and the Omega� �</EM>the beginning and the end�. </FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>The Grail, actually symbolised this crucial point in the cycle through which it was believed a regular �pulse� of energy (life force) from the �source-centre of creation� (which many of us would identify with �God�) is delivered. It was believed that it is through this same point or 'portal'&nbsp;that we receive our intelligence and guidance through our intuitive senses, and that through it one�s consciousness; one's&nbsp;soul, can ultimately ascend back to the source.</FONT></P>

<DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR><FONT color=tan>In searching for the origin of this ancient understanding, it would appear that at sometime in the deepest reaches of our past, certain people understood that reality is a �re-creative� process intimately related to our own consciousness and that like a <EM>beating heart,</EM> the source of this pulse is within everything; every cell, every molecule, every atom and subatomic body, and is what sustains our very existence. So, following is a brand new interpretation of the Grail � and one which has been completely overlooked. We have to approach the clues we are given �laterally� to see exactly what is being alluded to in many of these stories. <BR><BR>Some of this was mentioned in the book I co-authored with Philip Gardiner, <EM>The Serpent Grail</EM> (2005) which was based largely on Philip�s insights into the global serpent worship and his own unique theory, that the mix of the venom and blood of the snake was the original �elixir of life�. The material I am presenting here, and which I first touched on in my own contributions to our first book, are elaborated on further in the new revised version of <EM>The Shining Ones</EM> (2006). <BR><BR></DIV></FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT color=tan><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><STRONG><EM><FONT color=tomato size=4>The Cauldron, the Grail and the Void<BR></FONT></EM></STRONG><BR>Firstly, we are told that the Celtic cauldron, which has been compared to the Grail, is associated with <EM>healing, renewal </EM>and <EM>fertility. <BR></EM><BR>1) The cauldron would spew forth copious amounts of �wondrous food and drink� for the victors of battle and would also �resurrect� the dead soldiers. <BR><BR>2) The Grail is similarly said to produce an abundance of food and drink. <BR><BR>Again, the Grail, like the Celtic cauldron, is associated with fertility, regeneration, replenishment and sustenance, </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT color=tan><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><EM>and it appears suddenly, as if from nowhere . . . <BR></EM><BR>We find that by all accounts and descriptions the Cauldron which contains �everything�,&nbsp;corresponds&nbsp;with&nbsp;the philosophical and mystical descriptions concerning&nbsp;the �Transcendental Void� of Eastern tradition � the <EM>�nothing�, the �infinite� - the source-center of creation.&nbsp;</EM>Today,&nbsp;our physicists&nbsp;speculate on&nbsp;an ultimate ground-state of reality they call&nbsp;<EM>the �aether�, the �vacuum�, the 'quantum potential�, the �non-local�, the �zero-point field�&nbsp; - </EM>all of which correspond with 'the Void' of mystical tradition.<EM> </EM>In psychology&nbsp;this would be&nbsp;the <EM>�collective unconscious� - </EM>again,&nbsp;the �source-center� from which �everything� in the universe originates and manifests � hence the power of the cauldron to heal, regenerate and grant new life. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT color=tan><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan>The Void is �nothing� and �everything� at the same time and so here we can see that both the Cauldron and the Grail symbolise the Void from which everything in creation manifests and comes into being. However, as said, we&nbsp;are being told&nbsp;that the Grail is&nbsp;also associated with cycles -&nbsp;<EM>and that point in the cycle which is believed to signify a �doorway�, �portal� . . . �stargate�,</EM> into the �otherworld� (other dimensions) and ultimately back to the source-center of creation to which we are all linked.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT color=tan><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><FONT color=tomato size=4><EM><STRONG>The Grail and the Two Crucial Points in the Cycle<BR></STRONG></EM></FONT><BR>I would ask the reader to consult the diagrams I have created via this page as they are important in understanding what is being conveyed here: <BR></FONT><BR></FONT></FONT><A href="http://garyosborn.moonfruit.com/revelations2" target=_blank><FONT face=georgia color=steelblue>http://garyosborn.moonfruit.com/revelations2</FONT></A><FONT face=georgia color=steelblue> </FONT><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan><FONT size=2>(Please click on the alchemical image of the Ouroborus entitled <EM>�Cycle Diagrams�</EM>). <BR></FONT><BR></FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>As many of us will know, a fixed pendulum will only start swinging if we give it a gentle push, and it will only keep swinging <EM>if we keep �tapping� it at regular intervals.</EM> <BR>In this analogy, and in the context of both �consciousness' and 'physical&nbsp;processes�, the Grail symbolises the moments in the cycle �where� and �when� the pendulum is being �tapped� to keep it swinging � moving. Similarly, we could say that everything in the universe � from the microcosm of spinning subatomic particles to the macrocosm of swirling galaxies � is being "pushed" or �tapped� by a �pulse� of energy sent out from the source-centre at regular intervals to keep everything oscillating, vibrating, moving, revolving, active, and in existence. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>These pulses of energy are represented by the <EM>�transliminal phases�</EM> in travelling waves, <EM>�the nodes�</EM> in standing wave phenomena and all periodic systems, oscillations and frequencies. And&nbsp;close examination of&nbsp;the religious and mystical symbolism and also what is being alluded to in many textual sources,&nbsp;reveals that&nbsp;it was/is&nbsp;believed that whatever this&nbsp;'transliminal phase' is, it&nbsp;represents&nbsp;whatever is&nbsp;actually <EM>driving</EM> these waves and cycles onward and keeps them in motion. <BR>From their observation of cyclical phenomena,&nbsp;our ancient ancestors&nbsp;understood this <EM>dynamic</EM> in the cycle and this dynamic came to be symbolised in later times by the Cauldron and its religio-mystical counterpart, the Grail � its limitless "source of nourishment" symbolising the pulse of �infinite energy� that keeps everything in motion. We can see that being associated with the resurrection of the dead, that the Cauldron/Grail is also associated with the cycle of �life-death-rebirth� as expressed in the never-ending cycle of the seasons, and we see this with the appearance of the �Resurrection god� every year. <BR><BR>Within the yearly cycle, followers of religions from around the world celebrate the Spring or Vernal Equinox which now falls on or around 21 March. This is one of only two days in the year when day and night are equal in length � the other being the Autumnal Equinox which falls on or around Sept 21st � exactly six months later. These celebrations are said to be pagan in essence, but are more likely to have a shamanic origin. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>The <EM>zero-node </EM>in the cycle therefore represents the �Eternal Now� and the �Eternal Return� of esoteric tradition � and is the <EM>Alpha-Omega </EM>spoken of by Christ � the �resurrection god� in one of his many incarnations. Again, like the Grail this individual (�son of god� � �son of the sun� � meaning the �inner sun�) personifies this �pulse of creation� sent by the source-centre (the Father and Heavenly Kingdom) at crucial times in history � traditionally at the <EM>end-beginning</EM> point of each of the 12 zodiac ages in the larger Precessional Cycle consisting of 25,920 years according to tradition. So we can conclude that this crucial �pulse-point� in each and every cycle was also symbolised in various cultures by the resurrection or rebirth of a �slain god� or �vegetation god� (e.g. the Green Man) and at the precise moment �where� and �when� it was believed that a pulse of energy was delivered by the source-centre of creation to replenish the earth in abundance � <EM>continual rebirth. </EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>As said, the Cauldron also represents �the Void� and we find that these pulses of energy (zero-point energy) are delivered from the Void. If we go back to our analogy of the pendulum which is swinging between two extremes (opposites), the pulse that keeps&nbsp;the pendulum&nbsp;moving would be delivered everytime the pendulum crosses the neutral&nbsp;<EM>mid-point </EM>or <EM>�balance point� </EM>and where these opposites are fused or cancelled out altogether. Again, this �center-point� or �balance point�, crossed over twice in every cycle or swing, would represent the �portal� or �gateway� into the void at the center, and in this analogy, the void or center would be where the pendulum is being held above. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>The swing of the pendulum creates a triangular pattern, and we see here a correspondence between the point where the pendulum is being held, with the white, snowy apex of the mountain and the capstone of the pyramid � both of which represent <EM>zero-point. </EM></FONT></FONT><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>It should be noted that we also use a pendulum for dowsing � i.e., picking up those vibrations and frequencies that resonate with our thoughts and what we already know at a subconscious or unconscious level.</FONT></FONT><FONT color=tan>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>It's interesting that in the cosmology of Norse mythology, the Void is known as <EM>Ginnungagap</EM> � meaning <EM>�Yawning gap�, �beginning gap�; �gap with magical potential�; �mighty gap�</EM> . . . the �blackhole� from which everything has emerged and to which everything will return in the end. </FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>Keeping the above in mind in regard to this gateway or portal being the node point which is crossed over twice every cycle, <EM>Ginnungagap,</EM> or the <EM>Gap Ginnunga</EM> � being a �gap� between the worlds � is the �seeming emptiness� � again, the �Primordial Void� or Abyss, separating the opposites known as <EM>Niflheim</EM> the land of eternal ice and snow (corresponding with the feminine energy or principle) and <EM>Muspelheim,</EM> the land of eternal heat and flame (corresponding with masculine energy/principle). </FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>There are many names and terms for the Void:</FONT></P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>An African Zulu will call it the �<EM>Gate of Distance</EM>;� the Kalahari Bushmen know it as <EM>�Kia;�</EM> the �Yakut� of North Central Asia would call it <EM>�The Oibinkingata� </EM>� �Portal into the Earth.� The Ancient Scandinavians -&nbsp;the Norse -&nbsp;knew it as <EM>�Ygg� � �The Terrible One.�</EM> The Hebrews know it as <EM>�Daath� � </EM>again, <EM>�The Abyss.�</EM> So, as we can see, in the context of cycles, periodic systems&nbsp;and wave phenomena, the Void is also represented by the nodes (transliminal phases) or blank �gaps� (zero-nodes) in a 'standing wave' or an ordinary 'travelling wave' of energy, which is really a long drawn out cycle in our 3D reality.</FONT></P>

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>As mentioned in the book, <EM>The Serpent Grail</EM>, King Arthur was said to have gone into the Underworld to find and retrieve the magical �cauldron of rebirth� known as the <EM>Cauldron of Annwn</EM>. Arthur�s descent into the Underworld is told in the Welsh mythical classic, <EM>The Mabinogi.</EM> It is said that Arthur was accompanied by many men who helped him to find&nbsp;this place&nbsp;and so this is where we find the origin of the Grail Quest. The story also relates how dead warriors slain in battle would be placed in this �Cauldron,� during the night to re-emerge alive again in the morning � resurrected . . . reborn . . . <EM>reincarnated</EM>. <BR><BR>This is a very clever metaphor, showing us how all cycles are basically the same � in that they all consist of a positive and a negative half or phase&nbsp;� and more importantly, they all include the&nbsp;same two <EM>zero-points, </EM>(nodes) which were seen as the most significant part of the cycle. </FONT></FONT><FONT face=georgia color=tan><FONT color=tan>To grasp the beauty of this metaphor, we really need to think about what we are being presented with as clues so as to see and make the necessary connections:<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=tan>1) First of all, the words �night� and �morning� are mentioned. These relate to the <EM>�day-night� cycle </EM>� i.e., day being seen as �positive� and night being seen as �negative.� <BR><BR>2) Following logic, we then realise that the day-night cycle is intimately related with our <EM>�waking sleeping� cycle </EM>� again, waking being seen as �positive� and sleeping being seen as �negative.<BR><BR>3) We might then further realise that these cycles also correspond with the '<EM>annual cycle' </EM>consisting of summer and winter � summer being seen as �positive� and winter being seen as �negative.� <BR><BR>But more importantly, and if perceptive to what we are being told, we realise that the theme of life and death � the warriors having died in battle being placed in the cauldron at night, to reemerge in the morning, is really alluding to the belief <EM>that life and death are really part of the same cycle</EM> � the 'waking sleeping cycle' � and that this cycle also relates to all the others � i.e., �life� being seen as the positive half and �death� the negative. <BR><BR>Now the real point being made here is the role that the cauldron has to play in all this . . .&nbsp;<BR><BR>We are told that the warriors are placed in the Cauldron in the evening (nightime) and that they reemerge from it in the morning (daytime.) <BR><BR>Again, in my view, the Cauldron represents those two points in the cycle � the point where the day of 12 hours (on average) crosses over into the 12 hours of the night (the 12 hours of the ancient Egyptian <EM>Duat</EM> � �Underworld�) and the point where night crosses over into day again. </P></FONT></FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan><STRONG>a) </STRONG>We are being told that during this �twilight point� (dusk) from which night begins, the warriors are placed in the cauldron. They then re-emerge from the cauldron, and at this same �twilight point� in time (dawn) which begins the day. <BR><BR><STRONG>b) </STRONG>In the waking-sleeping cycle � sleep being known as the �little death� � this same point is the <EM>Hypnagogic State </EM>� the point �where� and �when� waking consciousness crosses over into sleeping consciousness. And it is the same point (the <EM>Hypnopompic State</EM>) �where� and �when� sleeping consciousness crosses over into waking consciousness � <EM>being a kind of mini �rebirth.� <BR></EM><BR><STRONG>c) </STRONG>In the yearly cycle this same point is the <EM>Spring Equinox</EM>; the point where the negative half of the year, which peaks in winter, crosses over into the positive half of the year, which peaks in summer. And it is the same point again, when during the <EM>Autumnal Equinox </EM>� the positive summer months cross over into the negative winter months. <BR><BR>The cycles mentioned above were believed to reflect the <EM>�cycle of life and death� </EM>� in that death was not seen as the end. Again, instead, it was believed � based on the observations and experiences of the shaman � <EM>that death was merely the negative half of the cycle.</EM> By observing the nature of cycles, the ancients believed that we all <EM>reincarnate</EM> � are reborn again. <BR><BR>However it must be emphasised � </FONT><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><FONT color=tan><EM>it was also believed that most of us go through this cycle unconsciously � in that we become �unconscious,� and at those two crucial points in the cycle � and this means during every moment and/or every&nbsp;instant of consciousness. <BR></EM><BR>Like the �resurrecting god�, as well as the Bennu, Phoenix and Christian Dove � all of which symbolise the Grail � the Grail will appear at certain times � i.e., periodically � <EM>and it is required that the initiate notices it and ask questions about it.</EM> </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><FONT color=tan>This detail in the Grail stories reflects our general <EM>unconsciousness</EM> of this spiritual source when it does appear, because indeed the Grail symbolises our �unconscious� or indeed the �collective unconscious�. In other words, if the Grail represents this point in the cycle, then we are being told that like the Grail it is important that we notice this point in every cycle and acknowledge it�s existence for our own spiritual growth, because in general we are ignorant of it and it is virtually a �blind-spot� for us. Again, it was known that <EM>we actually become unconscious during this point in the cycle and during every instant of consciousness.</EM>&nbsp;So then, the appearance of the Grail represents those crucial times �where� and �when� in the cycle we �become� and �are� <EM>momentarily unconscious</EM>, and this will be explained in a moment.<BR><BR>Furthermore, we find that this enlightened&nbsp;�resurrecting god� who&nbsp;is upheld as an example to us all&nbsp;� the one who is and remains conscious OF and AT this point in the cycle (�superconscious�) and therefore represents it because he is aware of the processes of life-death and rebirth � also provides the yearly harvest which corresponds with the �wondrous food� produced by the Celtic cauldron. Again, like the Grail, the appearance of the �resurrecting� god is periodic. <BR><BR>My theory (NPT, �Neutral Point Theory�) is that our own consciousness oscillates; that it is cycling at a rapid rate <EM>and that we are unconscious so many times a second</EM>. We do not notice this �blip� of momentary unconsciousness because these oscillations are �nano-seconds� in duration. In effect, our consciousness is blinking on and off. However, <EM>there are two �ON� phases and one �OFF� phase. <BR></EM><BR>The two �ON� phases are �conscious� (objective-outer) and �subconscious� (subjective-inner). These relate to the two divided halves of the cycle � i.e., positive (peak) and negative (dip) respectively � hence the symbolic use of the Sun and Moon in mysticism and alchemy, the correspondence with the male and female opposites and also the two sides of the brain. This means that our consciousness is alternating every instant between our focus on the <EM>external</EM> world and our focus on the <EM>internal</EM> world (our thought-feeling processes). <BR><BR>So then attention is being brought to that point which is neither �inner� or �outer� � again, the �neutral point� � a kind of �quantum zone� where time is �momentarily suspended�; where the observer becomes the observed and vice-versa, and �where� and �when� it was believed that our consciousness taps the �infinite� or that a pulse of energy is delivered to us by the source-center to which we are all linked. We can see that the processes of consciousness is not unlike the procreative process, because this point in consciousness where this division is momentarily healed and where a fusion of the two takes place - like the eclipse of the sun and moon )&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;is like the sexual coitus between male and female to produce a child. It is the creative spark.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><FONT color=tan>I shall quote a passage from <EM>The Serpent Grail</EM>: <BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=steelblue><EM><FONT color=wheat>�If we apply this symbolism to the Ouroboros, the snake�s tail represents the phallus, its mouth the female vagina, and the two unite at the neutral point in the cycle.

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tomato size=4><STRONG><EM>The Grail and the Unconscious</EM></STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan>My theory is that during normal everyday consciousness, it is necessary that we be virtually unconscious at this fusion point in the oscillating cycles so that we do not access too much energy/information at once and so only �tap� and �extract� the same measure of energy/information required to sustain the patterns �we are� and what we experience during our existence in reality. This is the reason why our daily patterns tend to repeat and why in general our lives are a series of �repeating patterns� � many of which we find difficult to break like a bad&nbsp;habit.&nbsp;<BR><BR>This �unconscious moment� is the �OFF� phase which happens twice during the cycle - i.e., where peak-positive crosses into dip negative and vice versa, and this brief �transliminal phase� would relate to the Unconscious and indeed where we become momentarily unconscious in the cycle. <BR><BR>The sequence regarding this cyclical process of our own consciousness goes something like this: <BR><BR>Conscious . . . <STRONG>UNCONSCIOUS</STRONG> . . . Subconscious . . . <STRONG>UNCONSCIOUS</STRONG> . . . Conscious . . . <STRONG>UNCONSCIOUS</STRONG> . . . Subconscious . . . <STRONG>UNCONSCIOUS</STRONG> . . . Conscious � <EM>and so on, ad infinitum</EM>. <BR><BR>In the daily cycle these three phases would be <BR><BR>1) Day [conscious] <BR><BR>2) Night [subconscious] and <BR><BR>3) The sun halfway on the two horizons [unconscious] � which again represents that neutral point in the cycle where day (positive) crosses into night (negative) and night crosses into day <BR><BR>In the �third�, we see here an explanation as to the significant titles or epithets given to the �resurrection god� in the form of sun god Horus when syncretized with Atum-Ra the �father god� who personified the �source-center of creation. <BR><BR>These epithets are <EM>Ra-Horakhte</EM>, (�Horus of the Two Horizons�) or <EM>Harmakhet,</EM> (�Horus in the Horizon�). Again, the esoteric term, �Black Sun� really relates to our <EM>unconsciousness</EM> of this �inner sun� and at this point in the cycle. Indeed the Tibetans � especially of the <EM>Bon-Po </EM>tradition � call the Void, the <EM>�Black Sun�</EM> or the <EM>�Sun behind the Sun,�</EM> mostly in reference to this Source-Centre being perceived as a �Black Void� . . . Nothing!� <BR><BR>In the annual cycle these brief �neutral point instants� are represented by the two days of the&nbsp;Spring and Autumnal equinoxes where summer (positive) crosses into winter (negative) and where winter crosses into summer � hence the crucifixion which takes place at Easter, being the first full moon after the Spring Equinox . . .&nbsp;<EM>"I am the Alpha and the Omega saith the Lord".</EM> <BR><BR>Indeed this �third phase� or �neutral point�, which is crossed over twice, comes at the halfway point of the cycle and also the end-beginning point in the cycle. Furthermore, these three phases also&nbsp;correspond with&nbsp;the three phases of the moon - 1) waxing (positive) - 2) waning (negative) - and 3) full moon and new moon (neutral point and node dynamic) - all of which was believed to be related to the female menstrual and ovulation cycle � hence the symbol of the �egg� at Easter. <BR><BR>As said, in the waking-sleeping cycle these two neutral points would be the hypnagogic and hypnopompic states (shamanic trance state) where waking activity crosses into sleeping consciousness (hypnagogic) and where sleeping crosses into waking again (hypnopompic). And again, w</FONT></FONT><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan>e can also see why the eclipse of the sun and the moon, which is said to have also taken place during the Crucifixion, would also represent this point in consciousness �where� and �when� the opposites are cancelled out and time is suspended (�time out of time�) . . . and �where� and �when� the "gateway" opens up to the unconscious/superconscious. Christ is on the <EM>Cross of opposites </EM>and from here he is able to enter heaven � the �other world�. As&nbsp;mentioned,&nbsp;we are usually unconscious at these points in the cycle, but the shaman sought to become conscious at this point, and he would use the slower �waking-sleeping cycle� to capture it. This again is the shamanic 'trance state' � being the hypnagogic � and so accessing this point �consciously� was believed to open up a portal to the �other world� and perhaps even to&nbsp;the highest level . . . enlightenment. <BR><BR>This is the first time these conceptions based on the cycle, has been explained in this way. <BR><BR>I would also emphasise that these three phases of the cycle are expressed in the conception of the <EM>Triad </EM>� present in many of the world�s religions. <BR><BR>These three phases are also the real meaning behind the <EM>Tetragrammaton</EM> � the �name of God� in Hebrew, which is written right to left, and for the first time we see here the correct meaning&nbsp;behind this name or formula.<BR></P></FONT></FONT><FONT face=georgia>

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>The fusion by which this enlightenment can be achieved is revealed in the <EM>Androgyne</EM> � the conjunction of male and female opposites, and this is further supported by the <EM>Ouroborus</EM> serpent also in the form of the ancient Egyptian and Sumerian <EM>Shen Ring</EM>, held in the left hand.

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>Again, all cycles are the same, in that they contain the same three phases � again the Triad.

In terms of the collective, we are also being told that the spiritual conjunction that takes place in the mind and body of the individual experiencing enlightenment is symbolized by Giza, said to be situated at the center of the earth�s landmasses between the opposites of east and west. </FONT></P>

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>In terms of the real �end-beginning� point in the �annual cycle�, the above explains why it was believed that the �resurrection god� who represents the alpha-omega dies, and reappears again around the Spring Equinox � again, once considered the real <EM>alpha-omega</EM> point of the year.

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><FONT color=tan>The Great Pyramid acts as a sundial for the Solstices, and is a perfect marker for the two Equinoxes, because at these times of the year it does not cast a shadow . . . as if everything is reduced to zero. After discovering an ancient code that appears to be associated with the obliquity of the earth�s axis, I am �inclined� (pardon the pun) to ask, <EM>did the earth tilt from its upright position long ago</EM>? (See article <EM><A href="http://www.freewebs.com/garyosborn/235degrees.htm">23.5 degrees</A></EM>) It�s a question that we cannot yet answer and a question that many would refrain from asking, but nevertheless there are many that believed this and still believe it today. <BR><BR>If the earth did tilt from an upright position, then it�s easy to see �how� and �why� man conceptualised these ideas, stories, myths and all the symbolism associated with the �alpha-omega� and these two crucial points in the cycle, and why they were deemed important. The alpha-omega, as represented by both these two points in the cycle, also represents the �Golden Age� of the upright axis � an age when everything was aligned with the Creator � the source-center of creation, or so it was believed. <BR><BR>With the tilt it was believed that man fell into these cycles and therefore he tasted �death� � in that death was a necessary part of the cycle � it being the negative half or phase of the cycle. Time began and man then had to toil the earth to sustain himself in a world that periodically died during the winter season. Man then began to note the correspondences this �death phase" made in regard to the opposites that he recognised in all phenomena � which he believed was the result of his own �dual perception� of the world � again, the result of �the fall�. It was believed that this duality in consciousness is the cause of all conflict; that this �divide� limits man�s intelligence whereby, in general he cannot always see beyond and above his present condition. We can also see that this division in consciousness results in an �us� and �them� mentality that can easily be taken advantage of and exploited, and that in general the populace can easily be manipulated by �an elite� that understands these processes and strives to always remain above this duality. Such a group would use Machiavellian techniques based on the same esoteric principles as outlined and would implement them in terms of creating a problem which leads to a <EM>�thesis�</EM> and <EM>�antithesis�</EM> situation and then providing a solution that really suits their own agendas � <EM>synthesis.</EM> <BR>However this knowledge and wisdom, which is symbolised by the Grail, are for everyone to discover for themselves and comprise the teachings attributed to the �resurrection god� who appears at the right time to deliver this knowledge � hence the connection the Grail has with the Passion of Jesus Christ � one of many in the long line of Christed Ones or Anointed Ones - one of these being the ancient Egyptian god Osiris. </FONT></FONT><FONT color=tomato><STRONG>[3]&nbsp;</STRONG></FONT></FONT></P>

Here's an apt&nbsp;quote:&nbsp;<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=cyan><FONT color=wheat><EM>�When Osiris was enclosed in the trunk of a tamarisk tree, which was later cut down and used as a pillar in the palace of the King of Byblos, he metaphorically became as one with the Tree of Life.

He held the heavens in his outstretched arms, and he soaked up the word of God from the waters of the Netherworld�</EM>.</FONT> </FONT><STRONG><FONT color=tomato>[4] <BR></FONT></STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT color=tan>The tilt of the earth as symbolised by the cross being <A href="http://www.freewebs.com/garyosborn/235degrees.htm">carried by Jesus,</A> reflects the same imbalance in consciousness and vice-versa. The upright cross of crucifixion by which Jesus ascends to heaven, is itself a metaphor for uprightness, stability and spiritual communion with the Creator and one�s own ascension.

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>Lastly, and in relation with the precessional cycle, the Grail as the cup or chalice, also signifies the star constellation of Orion, which is associated with the archetypal shamanic 'resurrection god' - the ONE who has experienced enlightenment.

As we can see, Orion (Osiris) is missing his head and legs. The head is signified by the 'communion disk' of wafer brought by the dove (phoenix, bennu bird) and the 'communion host' or 'disk'&nbsp;really represents the thalamus at the center of the head/brain, and this is also represented by the <EM>benben</EM> stone or pyramidion which caps the Great Pyramid - now missing.

<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>The Grail appearing twice in the story, points to the special times in the year when Orion crosses the Giza Meridian during the two days of the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes (this is&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;meanings of the Crucifixion Cross)&nbsp;and also its position on the Giza Meridian during the Alpha-Omega point and Halfway point in the Precessional Cycle. Giza was planned and built as a <EM>precessional clock, </EM>to chart the precessional cycle and other cycles, and the constellation of Orion, and&nbsp;especially the star <EM>Al-Nitak </EM>- in Orion's right side -&nbsp;was used as a marker for precession. The clue to this is given in the Gospel of John, where Jesus (who represents the resurrection god)&nbsp;is pierced in the right&nbsp;side by Longinus as he&nbsp;hangs&nbsp;from&nbsp;the cross. This detail in John's&nbsp;Gospel is also an allusion to the&nbsp;southern shaft that exits the south wall of the King's Chamber within the Great Pyramid and which once aligned with the&nbsp;star Al-Nitak - again in the right side of Orion - and&nbsp;in the year 2368 BC. The&nbsp;significance of the number 2368 is also an encoded clue to this alignment, as the name Jesus Christ (<FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><B><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">IhsouV CristoV)</SPAN></B><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"> </SPAN>in <I>Gematria,</I> <SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">is 2368. </SPAN><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Jesus = 888.

<DIV style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>The dove is based on the myth of the Phoenix, and in the Phoenix story the Phoenix brings an egg containing the body of its dead predecessor which it places on top of the altar - an obelisk or pillar in the ancient Egyptian city of Heliopolis - the 'City of the Sun'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=georgia color=tan>This is interesting because the bread or wafer brought by the Dove every Easter to the Grail Castle, symbolises the body of Christ. This "egg" brought by the Phoenix also doubles as the Benben pyramidion capstone which caps the obelisks and pyramids and is associated with the Bennu bird - the original bird on which the Phoenix is based. We would do well to note that the capstone of the Great Pyramid, which is missing, is believed to be the <EM>'Head Stone of the Corner' </EM>mentioned in the Bible, and is believed to represent the body of Jesus Christ. In cross-referencing all these elements we find that everything points to Egypt as being the original source of the Jesus and Grail stories - and rather the location of Giza which is said to be at the centre of the earth's landmasses, between east and west,&nbsp;and&nbsp;represents the alpha-omega as the earth rotates on its axis.</FONT></DIV>
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>The Bennu itself is based on the 'Ba' bird - being the human soul - a gift of the creator god Atum, and so each of us has this divine spark within us, 'symbolised by the Benben capstone', which reincarnates - hence the 'resurrection' or 'rebirth' aspect presented in these myths and stories of the Bennu, the Phoenix, Osiris, Christ and the Grail.&nbsp; Again, the "egg", the benben, and the communion host, are brought at the crucial point in the annual cycle, (Dove, communion host) and the precessional cycle (Phoenix, "egg"). All this would mean that the altar, column or obelisk and later the pyramid, has been replaced by the 'Grail Castle' in the stories of the Grail, first written in the 12th century AD.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Again, in the photo above, the cup appears to be resting on a serpent or perhaps an ancient Egyptian Barque or Ark - boat. We also see a fish and a serpent on either side of the head.<BR>But we are also given a clue as to what the Grail is really associated with in the image of the pyramid inside the Grail-cup - the crossed-disk positioned at the apex or capstone. Furthermore these are above the head and in the same position as the bindu point in Hindu and Tantric illustrations of the chakra system.</FONT></P>
<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left><FONT face=georgia color=tan>This is further evidence that the Grail is originally associated with the pyramid of Giza - the archetype for the 'Grail Castle' - and that the pyramids themselves are associated with the 'Kundalini enlightenment experience' - being the real Grail - as experienced by the 'resurrection god' who exemplifies this experience and is represented by the constellation of Orion - the marker for precession, with the cycle of precession itself being&nbsp;a consequence of the earth's tilted axis.&nbsp;</FONT></P><FONT face=georgia><FONT color=tan><FONT color=steelblue>
