			<p align="justify">What was left of the Chalet, which was so popular with the post-World War II generation, was demolished yesterday.
Work on the demolition of what was once a gathering point for young people began a few days ago, with the removal of the top part of the structure. The pillars were pulled down yesterday.
A spokesman for the Resources and Infrastructure Ministry told The Malta Independent yesterday that extreme care was being taken so that building material does not end up in the sea.
The work is being carried out by employees from the ministry's Works Division, in collaboration with a private contractor.
The Chalet, which was built in the area known as Ghar id-Dud in the centre of Sliema, was constructed on a reef projecting out from the shoreline. It was completed in 1926 to the design of the British architect B.W. Cordwell. 
The chalet at Ghar id-Dud was a popular rendezvous as an open-air caf� and dance floor until the early 1960s, when it was closed down due to severe deterioration that had rendered the structure unsafe.
Ever since its closure the platform structure support on concrete columns has suffered even further deterioration due to its highly vulnerable location, exposed as it is to the elements. 
Interest in repairing the structure was shown in the mid-1960s by a foreign company, but nothing came  of the proposals. 
There were other rumours of a possible rehabilitation in more recent years but, again, the plans never materialised.
The chalet is no longer there. And with it a part of Sliema�s history has gone for ever.
