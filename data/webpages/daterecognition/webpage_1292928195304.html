			<p>Aging</p>
			</b>
			<p>Bobwhites may be aged to young of the year (birds hatched in the 
			latest breeding season) and older birds. The older birds are more 
			than a year old but you cannot tell how much more.<b><img border="0" src="ageing.jpg" width="450" height="337" align="right"></b></p>
			<p>Young of the year have one or more white tips on feathers called 
			the primary coverts (see arrow in accompanying image; original photo 
			by Dale Rollins). The primaries are the large flight feathers on the 
			outer part of the wing. The primary coverts are a group of feathers 
			that overlap the primaries towards the front of the wing.</p>
			<p>The wings of older birds have solid-colored brown to grey-brown 
			primary coverts (no white tipping).</p>
			<p>Aging bobwhites gives a notion of productivity in the last 
			breeding season. In Oklahoma, a ratio of two to three young per 
			adult indicates low production. A ratio of four indicates average 
			production and a ratio of five indicates high production.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Chicks</p>
			</b>
			<p>A continuing mystery to fans of the bobwhite is how any chicks 
			ever survive to adulthood. Chicks weigh but six grams (one-fifth 
			ounce) upon hatching. They lack the ability to generate body heat 
			(they�re cold-blooded) for the first four weeks after hatch. During 
			this time, adults brood (cover chicks with their body and wings) to 
			keep the little ones warm.<img border="0" src="bobchick.jpg" width="200" height="141" align="left"></p>
			<p>The first four weeks after hatch are critical for bobwhite 
			chicks. During this time, they tend to experience high death rates 
			to various causes.</p>
			<p>Chicks can fly at about two weeks old.</p>
			<p>The diet of chicks must contain high amounts of protein during 
			the first few weeks of life. During this time the young birds eat 
			large quantities of insects and spiders, which consist mainly of 
			protein. The birds reach a maximum growth rate at about thirty-five 
			days of age. They reach adults size at about 150 days old.</p>
			<p>The survival rate of chicks from hatch to adult size is about 
			50%. This means that fifty of every 100 hatchlings enter the adult 
			population in fall.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Diet</p>
			<p></b>Studies of the bobwhite diet indicate that they eat hundreds 
			of<img border="0" src="ragweed.JPG" width="250" height="375" align="right"> 
			species of plants and animals. The most important food by bulk 
			changes with geographic location and season. For example, the seeds 
			of western ragweed (photo) are extremely important in the winter 
			diet of bobwhites in the southern Great Plains.</p>
			<p>Greens are good sources of vitamins and water but provide few 
			calories.</p>
			<p>The seeds of wild grasses such as bristlegrass provide moderate 
			loads of calories. Domestic cereal grasses such as wheat, milo, and 
			corn are loaded with carbohydrates and calories but are insufficient 
			in protein.</p>
			<p>Forbs (broad-leaved herbs) provide important seed foods. Members 
			of the sunflower, euphorb, and legume families are notable providers 
			of fats, carbohydrates, and protein.</p>
			<p>Invertebrates (insects, spiders) are essential for the protein 
			nutrition of breeding bobwhites. These animals are excellent 
			all-around foods whenever they are available.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Fall Shuffle</p>
			</b>
			<p>The fall shuffle is an annual event in the lives of bobwhites. In 
			the 1930s, the shuffle was considered a coming together and mixing 
			of singles, pairs, and small broods. These movements created the 
			best covey size of about eleven birds. Coveys of eleven survive the 
			winter at higher rates than smaller or larger coveys.</p>
			<p>In the 1950s, the shuffle was also described as movement from 
			summer to winter range and back. The range shift might involve 
			distances of a few hundred yards or several miles. Early-day 
			biologists believed bobwhites in western Oklahoma moved ten miles or 
			more from summer to winter range.</p>
			<p>Of course, some bobwhites occupy range that is suitable as summer 
			and winter cover; such birds likely follow the old notion that 
			bobwhites generally stay within a quarter-miles radius of where they 
			hatched.</p>
			<p>Seasonal range shifts sometimes explain why bobwhites disappear 
			from areas at the end of summer, only to reappear at the start of 
			the next breeding season. They have simply shifted ranges. Winter 
			ranges are characterized by more woody cover than summer ranges.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Heat Stress</p>
			</b>
			<p>Few people realize that blistering summer days are downright 
			dangerous to bobwhites.</p>
			<p>The bobwhite heat index, like that of humans, runs higher than 
			air temperature. On a day with air temperature the same as a 
			bobwhite�s body temperature (108 <sup>o</sup>F), virtually all the 
			cover available to bobwhites becomes hot enough to cause moderate to 
			severe thermal stress. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>When thermally stressed, bobwhites cool themselves with gular 
			flutter, a vibration in the throat region. This evaporates water and 
			cools in the same sense as a panting dog.</p>
			<p>Heat stress, as evidence by gular flutter, is a problem for most
			<img border="0" src="heatbobwhitesenemy.jpg" width="300" height="204" align="left">incubating 
			bobwhites when air temperature exceeds 95 <sup>o</sup>F.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Bobwhite heat indexes high enough to kill bobwhites are common on 
			hot days. Fortunately, the sun goes down before we lose birds from 
			heat overload.</p>
			<p>Manage against heat stress by insuring that mid-day coverts (sand 
			plum, fragrant sumac, other woody cover) are well dispersed on the 
			management area; these coverts provide cool sites for resting. Also 
			insure that ground cover is boot-top high. Temperatures of bare soil 
			can exceed 150 <sup>o</sup>F on hot, sunny days.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Multiple�brooding</p>
			</b>
			<p>Before the 1980s, biologists believed bobwhite hens produced at 
			most one brood during a breeding season. The subsequent confirmation 
			of second and third broods produced by the same hen was an 
			interesting biological discovery. </p>
			<p>The same hen does not necessarily attend to all broods. She might 
			turn incubation and brood-rearing duties over to a male, or she 
			might abandon a brood early so that she can begin another nesting 
			attempt.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The first brood, however, remains the major influence on 
			production. It puts around 70% of chicks on the ground with about 
			28% coming from second broods and 2% from third.</p>
			<p>Third broods have piddling effects because it is improbable that 
			a hen will be associated with three successful hatches. Indeed, only 
			about three of every 1,000 hens might raise three broods in a 
			typical year.</p>
			<p>You cannot tell which nesting attempt a hen is on later in the 
			breeding season. However, late July through September hatches may 
			represent multiple brooding.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Nesting</p>
			</b>
			<p>Bobwhite hens begin to lay about mid-April. During the next three 
			weeks, there is a threshold-like increase in laying activity in the 
			population. The activity remains high through May, and the last 
			hatches may occur in early October.</p>
			<p>The number of eggs in a nest averages 13�14 over the nesting 
			season. However, nests laid earlier have more eggs than those laid 
			later. For example, nests started on May 15 average 15 eggs, whereas 
			those started on August 15 average ten eggs.<img border="0" src="hatchnest.jpg" width="300" height="198" align="right"></p>
			<p>Males and females incubate the eggs. This is not a sharing of 
			duties. Rather, the individual responsible for a nest handles all 
			incubation, which lasts 22�24 days.</p>
			<p>The main function of an incubating adult is to keep the eggs warm 
			when it is cool and cool when it is hot. High temperatures are more 
			likely to kill the embryo in an egg than low temperatures. The 
			average temperature in a bobwhite nests hovers are around 86 <sup>o</sup>F, 
			which is below the temperature recommended for artificial incubation 
			(99 <sup>o</sup>F).</p>
			<p>The eggs hatch more or less at the same time. The attending adult 
			may take chicks away from the nest soon after hatching or remain at 
			the nest for several hours.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Nesting Cover</p>
			</b>
			<p>March brings the fading of winter and the flourishing of spring. 
			It is a good month to judge the status of nesting cover for 
			bobwhites.</p>
			<p>Bobwhites nest under many different species of plants. As a 
			group, though, perennial grasses such as little bluestem and western 
			wheatgrass are most important.</p>
			<p>During March,
			<img border="0" src="nestingcover.JPG" width="300" height="199" align="left">these 
			grasses form what is called residual nesting cover. It is the 
			dead-standing stems and fine leaves of grasses that grew in the last 
			growing season. Bobwhite hens nest in residual clumps at least a 
			foot tall and a foot in diameter. </p>
			<p>Such clumps should be broadly available when hens start laying 
			about the middle of April. In general, the greater the number of 
			nesting clumps, the better the odds that a nest will be successful 
			(less likely to be lost to a predator). </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Also, nesting cover available early in the nesting season fosters 
			the all-important first attempt. This attempt puts about seventy 
			percent of chicks on the ground that are going to hatch in a typical 
			breeding season. </p>
			<b>
			<p>Roosting</p>
			</b>
			<p>The roosting circle formed by bobwhites is a unique behavior 
			among quail. California and Gambel�s quail roost in the limbs of 
			brush. Scaled quail roost on the ground but individuals in a covey 
			are scattered about.</p>
			<p>The roosting circle of bobwhites is thought to serve two 
			purposes. First, it gives a 360-degree field of vision for a covey. 
			The broad field of vision may
			<img border="0" src="winroost.JPG" width="400" height="265" align="right">assist 
			birds in detecting the approach of ground predators.</p>
			<p>Second, the circle is a means of heat conservation. Bobwhites 
			roost in a compact formation with tails together and heads pointing 
			out. Because of this huddling, heat lost by one bird is absorbed by 
			the next. The net effect is that bobwhites burn less food energy 
			because of the roosting circle and therefore they need less food 
			than if they roosted as singletons.</p>
			<p>During extremely cold nights, the roosting circle may morph into 
			a disorderly pile of bobwhites. This behavior has been observed in 
			the laboratory and in the field. Birds at the bottom of the pile 
			experience temperatures much higher than air temperature.</p>
			<b>
			<p>Survival</p>
			</b>
			<p>The oft-repeated dogma is that bobwhites experience 80% mortality 
			each year, which implies 20% survival. These numbers apply to birds 
			that have reached adult size. Actually, bobwhites in southern climes 
			sustain about 70% annual mortality (30% annual survival). The 
			survival rate varies from year to year wherever bobwhite populations 
			persist.</p>
			<p>Nest survival typically averages 30% with values of 40�50% 
			commonly reported. Bobwhites counteract low nest success rates with 
			large clutches and multiple nesting attempts.</p>
			<p>The annual survival rate starting at the drop of an egg is quite 
			shocking. We might expect 100 eggs to yield five adults a year hence 
			(95% loss).</p>
			<b>
			<p>Weight</p>
			</b>
			<p>Bobwhites in Oklahoma reach adult weight (6.3 ounces) at about 
			150 days after hatching. In September, all birds�younger, older, 
			male, female�average about 6.3 ounces if they are at least 150 days 
			old. Bobwhites north of Oklahoma tend to weigh more, while bobwhites 
			south of Oklahoma tend to weigh less.</p>
			<p>After September, the average weight begins to increase. October 
			bobwhites average 6.5 ounces, November bobwhites 6.8 ounces, and 
			December bobwhites 6.9 ounces. A few trophy birds might exceed 8.3 
			ounces.</p>
			<p>After December, there is an orderly decline in bobwhite weights. 
			By March, birds weigh about the same as they did in the preceding 
			September.</p>
			<p>Actually, the heaviest bobwhites of the year are laying females. 
			Their weight increases because of eggs and the reproductive tissue 
			necessary to form eggs.</p>
