<p><font size="4" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="1. The Astor Bloodline">1. The Astor Bloodline</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The original founder of the Astor fortune was John Jacob Astor (1763-1884). 
John Jacob Astor was born in Waldorf, Duchy of Baden (Germany) from a Jewish 
bloodline. The Jewish origins have been hidden, and quite a number of various 
ideas of the Astor�s heritage have been put into circulation by the Astor's. 
John Jacob Astor was a butcher in Waldorf. In 1784, he came to America after a 
stop over in London, England.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Although the story is that he came to America penniless--and that may be 
true--he soon joined the Masonic Lodge, and within 2-3 years had become the 
Master of the Holland Lodge No. 8 in N.Y. City. (This Holland Lodge is a 
prominent lodge in that many of its members have good connections to the 
Illuminati elite. An example of just one Lodge #8 member is Archibald Russell, 
1811 - 1871, whose father was President of a real hotbed of Illuminati action 
for many years: The Royal Society of Edinburgh). By 1788, Astor was a master of 
Masonic lodge#8. This is rather interesting considering Astor could not speak 
English when he arrived in America, and supposedly was very poor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">John Jacob Astor was always very famous for being coldhearted, anti-social, 
�a man who didn�t have charm, wit or grace.� (This quote comes even from a 
relative of the DuPont family who wrote a sympathetic Biography entitled The 
Astor Family.) If this man lacked social graces and was so cold, and was so poor 
during his first years in the U.S., why did he rise to such prominence in 
Freemasonry? Certainly not because of his social graces. For instance, one time 
later in life at a meal given for elites, when his hands got dirty at the table 
he reached over and used the shirt of the man beside him to wipe his hands.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The original financial break came by carrying out a series of shady and 
crooked real estate deals in the N.Y. city area. The next break came when two 
men who are now known to have been in the Illuminati gave John Jacob Astor a 
special government privilege. The two men were Pres. Jefferson and Secretary 
Gallatin--both Illuminati members. The United States government had placed an 
embargo on all U.S. ships from sailing with goods in 1807. But Astor got special 
permission from these two men for his ship to sail with its cargo. His ship 
sailed and made close to a $200,000 profit in that day�s money. Astor strangely 
profited greatly from the War of 1812, which crippled almost all the other 
American shippers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Astor also worked together with George Clinton, another member of the 
Illuminati, on land deals. Even at that period in history, British intelligence 
worked for the Committee of 300 and for the Thirteen Top Families, it is 
interesting then, that John Coleman who had access as an intelligence agent to 
secret documents, discovered that the original John Jacob Astor was also a 
British secret agent. The Thirteen Families have very intimate roles with the 
American and British intelligence cults. Prior to 1817, John Jacob Astor entered 
into the fur trade and remained the biggest player in the fur trade until he got 
out of it in 1834. Over the years, he had managed to build up a monopoly. How he 
managed to push everyone else out is a good question. Bear in mind, white people 
had been trapping furs in the New World for several centuries, and the Indians 
for who knows how long. Then this guy Astor comes along and in a few years 
totally owns the whole industry! Again this could only have happened, because 
the occult power of this Astor family gave them the right. Obviously, others in 
the Committee of 300 had to step aside, if his position in the hierarchy had not 
given Astor the right, believe me the other families that originally controlled 
the fur trade would have gotten rid of Astor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One result of his fur company, was that Astoria, OR was created. Today, 
perhaps in honor of the family that originally took interest in it, Astoria is a 
real hot-bed for the secret Satanic covens in Oregon. John Jacob Astor did have 
a few helpful connections. Three of his relatives were captains on clipper 
ships. He had connections in London to the Blackhouse family. He married a Todd, 
a family frequently associated with Satanism. His wife, a Todd, was also 
connected to the influential Brevoort family. And finally for some reason, John 
Jacob Astor was also on good relations with the politicians of the day, perhaps 
because most of them were Freemasons too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">For a few years John Jacob Astor had participated in the opium trade, but in 
1818-he publicly quit running opium to China. John Coleman in his good book The 
Conspirator�s Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300, p. 131 notes, �John 
Jacob Astor made a huge fortune out of the China opium trade .... it was the 
Committee of 300 who chose who would be allowed to participate in the fabulously 
lucrative China opium trade, through its monopolistic BEIC, and the 
beneficiaries of their largess remained forever wedded to the Committee of 300.� 
Interestingly another Top 13 family, the Russell's, was also one of the lucky 
ones to get a slice of the China opium trade. It is clear repeatedly from 
history that Astor was privy to inside information in the government, and 
maintained his own courier system. John Jacob Astor bought up large amounts of 
land in NY which land greatly increased in value. The Financial Panic of 1837 
allowed him to foreclose on a large number of mortgages. John Jacob Astor�s 
wealth continued to skyrocket. As one biography said, �When it came to a 
question of principle versus profit, Astor was a practical man.� Put simply, he 
had no scruples. Astor had a reputation for being a ruthless landlord. He also 
had the reputation of not paying his legitimate debts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Astor became a banker, and sat on the board of 5 directors of the new 
national bank that Hamilton created for the U.S. government called the Bank of 
the United States. Astor owned a large block of the stock of the Bank of the 
United States. Astor also was fairly active during his life as a Freemason, 
holding several more key positions in the secret lodge life. John Jacob was the 
richest man in the United States. Note this reference. Meyers, Gustavus. History 
of the Great American Fortunes. London: Stationers Hall, 1909, p. 147 said, 
�Statistics issued in 1844 of manufacturers in the United States showed a total 
gross amount of $307,196,844 invested. Astor�s wealth, then, was one-fifteenth 
of the whole amount invested throughout the territory of the United States...� 
Is having 1/15th of all of what American money is invested not rich? John Jacob 
Astor�s descendents had a penchant for secrecy, and set up things to rule from 
behind the scenes. In contrast, to some of the other top families, the Astor's 
preferred not to sit on boards of corporations they controlled. In 1890, a real 
estate expert calculated the Astor's owned 1/20 of New York City real estate. 
After making their fortune while residing in the New York area, the Astor's by 
and large have all gone to England. They still wield great financial power in 
the United States through proxies. Forum Magazine, Nov. 1889, commented that 
authorities estimated the Astor's were worth $300,000, but that that figure had 
to be an underestimate. Today, my estimate of the Astor's is that they are worth 
about 40 billion dollars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the many foundations that the Astor's created was the Vincent Astor 
Foundation, which is controlled from England by the Astor's and has in the range 
of $100 million tax exempt dollars. The Vincent Astor Foundation has typically 
given to Catholic and Episcopalian needs, among other things. They also give 
money to agencies opposed to private ownership of guns. They give money to NY�s 
public library. Imagine how much influence that gives them, when the library is 
receiving regular help for general support? A 1971 Foundation Directory stated 
that the V. Astor foundation had its present emphasis on preventing juvenile 
delinquency. Why don�t I trust the Astor�s in helping out with law enforcement? 
The William Waldorf Foundation states that its purpose is �Promotion of mutual 
understanding and the diffusion of knowledge and culture among the United States 
and the dominions, colonies, and countries of the British Commonwealth.� This 
sounds very similar to the public statement of purpose that the secretive 
Pilgrim Soc. has given out to those who need something about them. Assets for 
this foundation are a mere $64,000. Vincent Astor (now deceased) was a member of 
41 private clubs, To give an idea of how much power just one of the many Astor 
men wield some of the businesses Vincent was involved include: director- 
American Express Company dir. Atlantic Fruit and Sugar Co. dir. Chase Manhattan 
Bank (of the Rockefellers) dir. City and Suburban Homes Co. dir. Classical 
Cinematograph Corporation dir. Cuban-Dominican Sugar Co. dir. Great Northern 
Railroad dir, Inter. Mercantile Marine Co. dir. National Park Bank of NY dir. NY 
County Trust Co. dir. Weekly Publications Inc. dir. Western Union Telegraph 
trustee NY Zoological Soc. advisor to Bankers Trust of NY member Amer. Museum of 
Nat. History member Nat. Institute of Social Sciences (notice these last two 
like so many elite controlled organizations are heavily involved in the spread 
of the evolution theory.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Just like the Rothschild's, DuPont's, and Rockefellers, the Astor's always 
set one of their Astor males as the head of the entire family. This headship is 
passed down as a birthright within the different branches of the family, just as 
any King passes on his throne. On the corner of 33rd St. and 5th Ave. (the site 
later began the site of the Empire State Building) the original Waldorf-Astoria 
Hotel was built by William Waldorf, et. al. The hotel opened in Mar. 1893. It is 
described as �the ultimate in snob appeal.� Later two Astor cousins built the 
Astoria (another even taller elite Hotel) in New York which opened in 1897. Of 
course, like many of the other elite families, the Astor's have their Maine 
property to get away and relax. In 1894, John Jacob wrote a novel A Journey in 
Other Worlds where he describes a society which operates on the idea of 
conserving energy. Strange how the elite likes to promote conservation among us 
�cattle.� In the late 1800�s, the Illuminati began to reconfigure its outward 
face. The higher levels started creating innocent sounding cover organizations 
to hide their meetings behind. In 1901, the Astor's contributed toward the 
creation of the Pilgrim Society, which was the cover organization for Amer. &amp; 
Brit. 6� Princes of the Illuminati. I believe at least five Astor's are now 
members of the Pilgrim Society. The Pilgrims had recently included David Astor, 
John Jacob Astor 8th, and William Waldorf Astor 3rd. And during the 1970s, Baron 
Astor of Hever was the President of the London branch of the Pilgrims. This 
implies that Astor of Hever was at least the next level up in the chain of 
command. The Astor's also have been very prominent in the Group� which is 
Britain's equivalent to the Skull &amp; Bones Soc. In Britain, the Astor, along with 
about 20 other families dominate the Group, just as certain families like the 
Whitney's in the U.S. help dominate the Order of Skull &amp; Bones.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Again, as was earlier pointed out, the key to understanding Satanism is the 
bloodlines. In 1910, the muscle and bone branches of the Illuminati reconfigured 
themselves with the creation of the Round Table groups in 1910. The Astor's were 
the part of the financial backers behind the Round Table groups along with Abe 
Bailey. Rhodes and Milner were key players in setting up The Society of the 
Elect, a super secret top circle of Illuminati. Rhodes Trust in part helped by 
the Astor, helps finance the Rhodes Scholarship system. Rhodes a high ranking 
Freemason wanted the Masonic clap-trap as part of these various new groups, but 
Milner and Brett did away with the Masonic rituals and costumes, etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1919, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) was created. And 
the Astor's were the major financial backers of the RIIA which functions as the 
4� cover of the Illuminati. For those who are new to this, the RIIA is the 
British equivalent to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) which takes a major 
role in the policy making process in the U.S. Waldorf Astoria was appointed to 
the RIIA. Just above the CFR/RIIA are round table groups which were initially 
named by Cecil Rhodes as the �Association of Helpers�. Cecil Rhodes set up the 
Rhodes Scholarships to recruit and bring top men from several nations to Oxford 
to be initiated into the Illuminati and to learn about how to bring in a 
One-World-Government, So the initial selection into the Rhodes program--1st 
degree of the Illuminati - is equivalent to the initiation into the Skull &amp; 
Bones. In the picture you see how the Cliveden Astor's were intimately connected 
to the Rhodes Scholars. Rhodes Scholars frequently went to the Cliveden Estate. 
By looking at the genealogy chart you can see how the family in London broke up 
into two powerful segments. One part centered around the Cleveden Estate. 
Another group became Barons-the Astor's of Hever - or the Hever Astor's for 
short. William Waldorf Astor owned the Pall Mall Gazette, the Observer, and the 
Pall Mall Magazine. The London Times was largely controlled by the Astor's, and 
since 1922 they have owned this major source of British news. The DuPont's and 
the Rockefeller's also have some major businesses where they too own blatant 
large holdings. However, most of the wealth of the 13 Top families is hidden so 
that the ties to who owns it are difficult to track. Hoyt Ammidon has been a 
proxy for Vincent Astor and the other Astor's. (See membership list of 
Illuminati in this newsletter). The Astor family also used Owen Lattimore as 
their proxy for opium trade, who in turn used Laura Spelman who was funded by 
the Institute for Pacific Relations (I. P. R.).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The I. P. R was the group that supervised the Illuminati�s decision to allow 
Red China to share in the Opium trade. The puppet strings behind big world 
events may not be seen by the public, but if we trace the origins of several big 
events we see the Astor's helping pull strings. The I. P. R helped lay the 
groundwork for the Pearl Harbor attack. The Astor's also were behind the 
appeasement policy in Europe which allowed Hitler to become a threat. The 
Astor's were also involved in the Temperance movement against alcoholic drink 
which was begun by the Women�s Christian Temperance Union. The Temperance 
movement was an elite created movement just like today we have big issues like 
Apartheid which are made up by them to keep us busy. Joseph Kennedy and Onassis, 
two other top 13 Illuminati families got rich off of the Temperance movement by 
bootlegging. So many people have exposed the Temperance movement (See Occult 
Theocracy for just one expose of Freemasonry�s involvement) that it is not 
pertinent to cover it here. Today�s equivalent of the Temperance movement is the 
drug war. Col. Jack Astor, one of the world�s most powerful men, was among those 
who went down with the Titanic. To his honor, he didn�t have to sacrifice his 
life, but did. If he had been a scoundrel he could have chased a woman and her 
children from some lifeboat. Many sermons have been preached on the significance 
of the Titanic, and I personally am beginning to feel that God laid it on the 
hearts of so many of his ministers to understand that the Titanic was a judgment 
upon the pride of the world. More specifically it was a warning to the New World 
Order�s elite. Another Illuminati invention was Communism. This has been so 
thoroughly documented I don�t know why I have to state it here, except that 
there are still people who haven�t taken the time to study it out. James II. 
Billington�s book Fire In the Minds of Men - a very scholarly work, and Occult 
Theocracy are some good starting points to study this. The Fabian Society was 
also connected to the Illuminati. For instance, Illuminati prince Prof. George 
Edward Gordon Catlin, Pilgrim Soc. member was a member of the Fabian Society�s 
executive committee. The Fabian logo is a Wolf in sheep's clothing!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Fabians like H. G. Wells who wrote so eloquently on the New World Order with 
such books as The New World Order, A Modern Utopia, The Open Conspiracy Blue 
Prints For A World Revolution was a wolf in sheep clothing. H. G. Well�s made 
the New World Order something that sounded advantageous to everyone, a Utopia of 
sorts. That is not what it will be. During the 1930�s, the Fabian Socialists 
created the Political and Economic Planning group (PEP). Mason Viscount Waldorf 
Astoria was a leader of PEP. A confidential program that the PEP created and 
implemented through the British government was later described in a book 
Principles of Economic Planning in 1935. The book doesn�t explain why its cover 
has a Masonic square and compass ostensibly displayed on its cover. George 
Bernard Shaw, who was a communist and Fabian Socialist was the best friend of 
Lady Nancy Astor, who became the first woman Member or Parliament.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">These two spend vast amounts of time together, much more than Nancy did with 
her husband Waldorf who she didn�t care to be around. Waldorf was the Mason that 
was mentioned earlier who helped lead PEP. After Nancy Astor was elected (or 
selected by the elite) to be the first lady MP, one of the Russell lady's soon 
afterwards also became an MP. Communism pretends it is the enemy of the rich 
capitalists, but both the rich elite and the communist leaders are committed to 
wipe out Christianity, to wipe out free trade with monopolies, and to set up an 
Illuminati One-World-Government. Do you see they have similar goals? A picture 
is included of Waldorf and Nancy Astor�s visit to Russia during the 1930s. The 
Astor's were not treated like enemies but like royalty. Can we see how the elite 
controlled press have deceived us? Do not trust our Illuminati-controlled elite 
to protect us from communism, they control communism. Besides socialism, Nancy 
Astor was a big supporter of Christian Science. Christian Science was a front 
for witchcraft from Its very beginning. For more information on what Christian 
Science is about I suggest people study Be Wise As Serpents, chapter 2.6 �The 
Healing Light�. Nancy Astor wrote The Natural History of the Vampire and a book 
on the early Mason/Communist Bakunin. She used Grenfell family papers. The 
Grenfell family were close friends to the Cliveden Astor's. David Astor, (The 
Honorable) attended Bilderberger meetings in 1957 and 1966. Alpha Lodge is the 
lodge in England that is traditionally for royalty. There are other elite lodges 
too, where the those of the elite, can protect themselves from rubbing shoulders 
with those of less social stature. These are the type of Masonic lodges that the 
Astor's Join.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In summary, an examination of the Astor family reveals their close 
connections with the full spectrum of Illuminati activities ranging from 
Freemasonry, the Illuminati itself, the Pilgrim Society, the Round Tables, 
Communism, Fabian Socialism, CFR, RIIA. the Bilderbergers, as well as the 
various politically (that is Illuminati) tainted banks such as Chase Manhattan. 
Ava Alice Muriel Astor was an occultist. She was born in 1902, was pretty but 
also a very serious woman. She was a very strong willed person that was able to 
dominate a person in her presence unless they were also strong willed. She was 
into Egyptian magic and believed she was the reincarnation of an Egyptian 
princess and a disciple of Ikhnaton. Alice Astor may have been one of the first 
people to enter King Tut�s tomb, where she got herself a necklace. Aldous Huxley 
wrote Brave New World as a picture of things that were to come --most people 
think as a expose, but it was really more as a plan or blueprint Aldous Huxley 
and Alice did a great deal of occult things together. Their financial power is 
unchecked. Myers and others have noted the Astor's are above the law. The Top 13 
families don�t obey the law--they are the law. The Astor's may have Illuminati 
Kings and Princes in their ranks, they may have dozens of billions of assets, 
yet it will all be nothing when they face their Creator at judgment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the items that I felt I should have given the readers back in the 
1/1/93 issue was the Masonic background of John Jacob Astor (1763-1848). For the 
record here is his Masonic involvement: Master of the Holland Lodge No.8, of N. 
Y. C.-1788 Grand Treasurer of the Grand Lodge of New York-1796-1801 Junior Grand 
Warden on two occasions-1796 &amp; 1801 Secretary of the comamandery (then called 
encampments). For a busy man, he kept himself busy In his Masonic work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">THE ASTOR FAMILY REVISITED WITH INFORMATION ON THEIR CHANLER BRANCH. THERE 
ARE 13 TOP BLOODLINES</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Thirteen families or bloodlines are at the top, and five of these families 
are the inside core of these thirteen. Prior to Be Wise As Serpents, the 
existence of thirteen top families was not known by very many people. The 
existence of the 13 families had come out in Berry Smith�s book Final Notice in 
the 1980s, but the names were still unknown. Berry Smith of Australia wrote in 
his book Final Notice p. 9, �There are 13 families or groups heading up the 
World Government plan. These families are portrayed as the 13 layers of blocks 
found on the strange seal on the reverse side of the U.S. $1 bill.� In a little 
read article, one SRA victim recently wrote that Satanism was controlled by a 
few families. Recently, one of the DuPont's was on a television show because the 
DuPont's were trying to kidnap him because they didn�t like his support for the 
book Dope. Inc. I was able to get a copy of the book, and was overjoyed to find 
such an excellent book. My sources have been telling me that the top Illuminati 
families were behind the drug trade. Yes, Satan�s top followers are also the 
kingpins in destroying humanity for profit through drug trafficking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The following families (besides others) or individuals from these families 
are mentioned in Dope Inc. as involved in some aspect of the drug trade: the 
Astor's, Bundy's, DuPont's, Freeman's, Kennedy�s, Li�s, Rockefellers, 
Rothschild's, and Russell's. It is no coincidence that nine of the Top 13 
families would get there names in a book which revealed the big names behind the 
world�s illegal narcotics trade. It should be mentioned that some other 
prominent Illuminati families also play key roles in the drug trade such as the 
Bronfman's, Cabot's, Shaw's, Bacons, Perkins, Morgan, Forbes, Cisneros and 
Oppenheimer's. Where have we seen such names before? There are names in Dope 
Inc. that people would do well to know the danger of such as Louis Mortimer 
Bloomfield, Robert Vesco, Francois Genoud of Switzerland, Ivan Slavkov of 
Bulgaria, the Duke of Kent - Master of the Grand Mother Lodge of the Scottish 
Rite, and Jardine Matheson to mention a few. All our favorite secret fraternal 
groups appear in Dope, Inc. too. For instance, the Triads, P2 Masonry, regular 
Freemasonry, the CIA, the Order of St. John, and the Jesuits. The Universal 
Christian Gnostic Church�s which practices black magic has a whole chapter 
showing its connection to the drug trade. Britain�s assassination bureau 
Permindex which has been mentioned previously in this newsletter also gets a 
chapter in the book. In the Be Wise As Serpents book, I examine in detail only 
the Rothschild's and the Russell's. I did not present much to back up my 
statements about the 13 families. Further, One of the unthinkable items that 
most people do not want to consider is that their leaders who they have idolized 
may be utterly corrupt. There was nothing to do but sit down and give the 
nitty-gritty details if the threat from the Illuminati was to be properly 
understood. The facts would speak for themselves. The ideal solution for both 
writer and reader was for me to write up my research and for you to read it as a 
series of articles. There is only so much a person can assimilate at once, and 
these articles give lots of details. In January of this year I began a series of 
articles on the top 13 families - families which the top experts said nobody 
knew about. I did this with the hope of stimulating others to notice these 
families, and to alert a wider sector of the Body of Christ. The young colleague 
David J. Smith, who wrote part of the Jan. 1 article on the Illuminati, was led 
to carry out further research in addition to what the Jan. 1 article had. Most 
of this article�s information on the Astor's then is a result of David�s 
research.</font></p>

THE FACTS.&nbsp;</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most of the material put out on the Astor's shows the unmistakable mark of 
distortion by writers and historians giving information in line with what the 
Astor's wanted the public to get. Books on the Astor's contain both believable 
and unbelievable material, fact and fiction, Some of the real facts may remain 
obscured forever, but that has not stopped us from getting the most accurate 
picture we could reconstruct. The Astor's do not make the task of investigating 
them easy. They have been very secret and very deceptive since they arrived In 
this nation. John Jacob Astor, the first prominent Astor was a notorious liar, 
�he was known on occasion to invent romantic tales for the edification of people 
who annoyed him with questions ...... Men who knew him best were, therefore, 
neither ready to discredit completely all legends about his exploits nor to 
repeat them as gospel. The truth, they suspected, lay somewhere between the two 
extremes.� (Terrell, John Upton. Furs by Astor., p. 102.) John Jacob�s son 
insured that his father�s lies would go unchallenged by incinerating all of his 
personal records, business records and other papers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY &amp; its NAME"><b>ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY &amp; its 
NAME&nbsp;</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Astor's have come up with various origins for themselves and those for or 
against the family have added more ideas. One strong possibility is that the 
Astor's are descendants of the Astorga family found in Southern Italy before the 
1600s. The most likely meaning of the name is that both Astorga and Astor are 
variations meaning �Astarte� who is the mother of the occult. Her name is also 
Semiramis. In Babylon the trinity was Nimrod (the sun), Semiramis (the moon), 
and Tammuz (the morning star). In Egypt, these gods were called Osiris, Isis, 
and Horus. The pictures and statues Isis and Horus were renamed by the Roman 
Catholic church as the Virgin Mary and the Christ-child.</font></p>
<p><a name="THE FAMILY IN EUROPE"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">THE 
FAMILY IN EUROPE</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font></b></a></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The family may have moved from Savoy to Waldorf, Germany. Although it is not 
a certainty, the best explanation from the available clues indicates that 
Waldorf�s coven had some important personages in the witchcraft/satanic system 
and that Johann Astor�s family had power. At that time in Europe, the Astor 
family had no chance to turn their occult power into success. The power and 
class structure In Europe was rigid and grid locked. The boundaries between 
peasant and aristocracy were solidly in place. So the family looked to the New 
World to transmute their position in the Satanic hierarchy into financial wealth 
and power. Johann Astor In Waldorf was only a butcher. His best son John Jacob 
(1763-1848) was selected to establish the House of Astor in America.</font></p>
<p><a name="JOHN JACOB ASTOR GOES TO AMERICA"><b>
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">JOHN JACOB ASTOR GOES TO AMERICA</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font></b></a></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At age 16, John Jacob Astor quit helping the family butcher business, went to 
England and then later to America. Looking at the details of things, and piecing 
the truth together it appears that his Satanic authority was already in place, 
because he was able to travel to England, and as a German-speaking peasant 
converse face to face with the Backhouse family in England. Of course the 
biographers make it sound like John Jacob Astor left Germany for himself, rather 
than his family. Michael Astor gives a glimpse of John Jacob�s mission, �He 
concentrated almost entirely on building a fortune, on escaping the poverty of 
his childhood and establishing a secure financial position for his family in 
America.� (Astor, Michael. Tribal Feeling p. 11)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="OVERVIEW"><b>OVERVIEW&nbsp;</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The process of 400 years looks like this. Various Satanic families moved into 
the Southwest German area in the late Medieval time period. Witchcraft 
associated with Diana was practiced In Southwest Germany, and this began to 
alarm various elements of the Roman Catholic church. The Astor family provides 
leadership in the covens in the Heidelberg area. Witchcraft spread virtually all 
over Southwest Germany. An examination of the old records from about 1500 to 
1650 show that witchcraft was being practiced throughout the area. (I have the 
names of over 120 towns were it was practiced in SW Germany, the list derived 
from old German records.) The Astor's did not have the position, wealth, and 
power that accorded their position in the late 1700s of occult leadership. In 
Germany, England and France there was no way to climb the social ladder. 
However, the New World presented opportunities. The Astor's sent two sons to 
prepare the way for John Jacob, one to England, one to America, and then sent 
John Jacob their most promising brightest son to the New World.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">While in America the Astor family helped the Satanic elite headquartered in 
England to maintain its control over America. Having come from Germany, and also 
due to Satanism being secret, John Jacob Astor�s help given to pro-British-elite 
moves were more difficult to suspect. After establishing themselves as 
aristocrats in America, the tribe of Astor's moved to England, where because of 
their high social position in America, no one questioned the Queen bestowing 
titles of nobility on them. All along the process, people with Illuminati 
connections opened doors for the Astor's. At this point, it needs to be pointed 
out that there were ties between the following groups: English royalty, English 
Satanism, English Freemasonry, and German witchcraft, and the Italian Black 
nobility. (Taking the liberty I have as author of this article, I am going to 
digress to give some examples of these connections. Although on the surface this 
doesn�t directly pertain to the Astor's, it does.) When one paints in the bigger 
panorama of what was happening in the occult world, and then one sees a blazing 
star streak across that panorama, then the real history of that blazing star is 
given by tracking its voyage through that panorama. However, the history books 
have intentionally hidden the significance of so many of the players and groups 
that lay along the track of that blazing streak.</font></p>

Helmet</b></a></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">--This was an illuminated secret society with Sir Francis Bacon at 
its head. In order to hide its Masonic rituals, Sir Francis Bacon wrote a play 
entitled �The Order of the Helmet.� This was performed in 3 Jan. 1594, and again 
for twelve days in December 1594. In Dec. 1594, British Aristocrats who had been 
demonically illuminated, met and put on a �play.� Calling their initiation 
ceremony a play was a great cover. Sir Francis Bacon was made king and �prince 
of purple.� Various men were invested with the Collar of Knighthood of the 
Helmet, and took vows, And a �Series of Charges by six High Councilors� was 
given in a manner that is very similar to what the satanic S.R.I.A. does now. 
The reader may ask what does this have to do with the Astor's? This is simply a 
few brief look at the background of what was happening in the occult in Europe. 
The Queen of England sent Sir Francis Bacon as a young man in his twenties to 
the continent of Europe. Sir Francis Bacon toured France in places such as 
Louvre, St. Cloud, Blois, Paris, and Poictiers, He also traveled to Germany, 
Italy and Spain. He visited the various royal courts, such as the court of 
Marguerite de Valois. Marguerite was married to King Henry of Navarre. Her 
mother was the evil Catherine de Medicis. Sir Francis Bacon also met with many 
secret societies. At Marguerite�s court he spent time with �The Pleiade� 
fraternity, which was a group of 7 intellectuals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">According to the best biographer of Sir Francis Bacon, who was Alf red Dodd 
(Alfred spent his entire life studying Sir Francis Bacon), Sir Francis Bacon was 
initiated into a large number of secret occult societies when he was on the 
continent of Europe. He learned kabbalistic magic, Egyptian mysticism, Arabian 
mysticism, and the customs of the German Steinmetzin. (Dodd, Alfred. Francis 
Bacon�s Life-Story. London: Rider &amp; Co., 1988, p.10.4.) This information has 
been provided to give some feel for how the occult in Europe was in contact with 
its various parts, and that its tentacles included many of the royal families.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="Hell Fire Club">Hell Fire Club</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> -- This was a secret 
Satanic cult which was associated with early Freemasonry. When the connections 
became known between the Satanists of the Hell Fire Club and the elite of 
Freemasonry, Freemasonry and the elite made some radical moves. First, 
Freemasonry publicly proclaimed that it had nothing to do with the Hell Fire 
Club. When the Hell Fire Club was publicly disbanded by the government (acting 
on orders from people that tied-in with the club). Later, quietly the club was 
reconstituted. Phillip, 1 at Duke of Wharton (1698-1731) who was the second 
person of nobility to be Grand Master of England�s Freemasons (G.M. of the Grand 
Lodge 6/1722-11/25/1723) was president of the Hell Fire Club. He was an M.P, in 
the House of Lords. In 1726, he left England and was a basically brought into 
ill-repute by the Masons, who distanced themselves from him. George Lee, Earl of 
Lichfield was also another prominent Mason who was a member of the Hell Fire 
Club. Benjamin Franklin, who was the head of the American Freemasons in various 
capacities, and also the head of the Rosicrucian's and a number of other secret 
occult groups was also a member of the Hell Fire Club. Benjamin Franklin�s 
Satanism was not mentioned in my Be Wise As Serpents book, but he was an 
important Satanist who was part of the Order of the Quest--that is the group 
which has been entrusted with the plans for bringing in the New World Order of 
Satan. Remember that John Jacob Astor was very involved with Freemasonry, as 
were a number of his intimate friends such as N.Y. Governor DeWitt Clinton and 
General John A. Armstrong. In regards to the Hell Fire Club, the Earl of 
Sandwich, Benjamin Franklin and Sir Francis Dashwood were leaders in the Hell 
Fire Club and were also Post-Master Generals of the British Postal Service, All 
were Freemasons too. Their positions as Post-Master Generals allowed them total 
access to the mail, and allowed them to spy on the communications of the 18th 
century. The man who became Post-Master General after Dashwood, who moved on to 
be a M.P, in the Br. Parliament, was the Mason John Wilkes. John Wilkes took 
over in 1766 (in 1774 was Lord Mayor of London). Wilkes then brought one of the 
original Hell Fire Club members, a friend of his Willis Hill to help with the 
Postal Service. The next Post-Master general was the totally corrupt man the 
Earl of Sandwich, who served until 1771. Benjamin Franklin spent the summers of 
1772, 1773, and 1774 at Dashwood�s estate in West Wycombe. The caves under 
Dashwood�s estate at West Wycombe were used for satanic sexual rituals, which 
were participated in by Benjamin Franklin.</font></p>

a reputation for his insatiable sexual lust to paw women.) One of the people we 
have to investigate in relation to the Ordo Saturnus is Valentine Jeune, who was

England to British Intelligence by his brother George. At any rate, he got 
involved in British intelligence which has always been closely linked to 
Freemasonry and the elite. He spent time socially with the Blackhouse family 
which an aristocratic family. How do you suppose such a supposedly destitute 
young man could be accepted so easily into the Blackhouse social scene? This is 
not explained by modern biographers. After four years, his brother George then 
sent him to America to represent George�s music company. His brother Henry met 
him when he arrived in 1784 at age 20 and introduced him to the occult world in 
New York City. Thomas Backhouse &amp; Co. was a leading house in the lucrative fur 
trade. John Jacob Astor set out to bring the fur trade under his own control. 
There is a tact that must be faced. the elite�s Committee of 300, a secret 
legislative group of the Illuminati, decided that John Jacob Astor could expand 
into the fur trade and into the opium narcotics trade. Dope, Inc. shows that the 
Astor family was the first American family to get into the Opium trade, and that 
their opium trade had was a special privilege that most other American 
businesses did not even try to compete with. Why? Dope, Inc. doesn�t say this 
but I know that it is because the Committee of 300 decides such things, not free 
enterprise. American furs yielded 1000% profit in those days. The privilege of 
fur trading was a pot of gold so to speak that the Committee of 300 gave Astor, 
and it could only have happened because the Astor family in Waldorf was already 
part of a principal satanic bloodline. (The Illuminati members of the Astor 
family today use their influence to help those of the Illuminati in their dope 
trade.) William Backhouse the American representative of the London Backhouse 
family and John Jacob�s brother Henry were two of John Jacob initial contacts in 
the New World. Soon John Jacob had met all types of people involved in New 
York�s occult world. John Jacob married Sarah Todd. John Jacob�s step-mother 
Christina Barbara is described as �the perfect, cruel fairy tale stepmother.� 
John Jacob �raised the principle of self-interest to the level of a philosophy 
and ..... claimed for himself a natural superiority over his less able and less 
powerful fellow men, a sort of God-given right to exploit the world and its 
inhabitants for his personal gain, This was not mere cynicism, but a genuine 
belief that in some way [he was] among the chosen people for whose convenience 
and advancement life was ordered ..... Such people ... make history, but they 
also pervert it in human terms because their world and the codes that govern it 
have nothing to do with morality.� (Sinclair, David. Dynasty The Astor's and 
Their Times. p. 59) �Astor took Freemasonry seriously... [Gov. DeWitt] Clinton 
rose unusually fast in the degrees, but the German Immigrant [John Jacob] who 
talked at times as if he had marbles in his mouth was not far behind him. Astor 
eventually caught up to Clinton...� (Terrell. Furs by Astor, p. 84).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">DeWitt Clinton�s uncle George Clinton, who served as Jefferson�s 
Vice-President was also a member of their Holland Lodge No. 8. Archibald Russell 
of the Russell family, as well as two members of the elite Livingstone family 
were members of this lodge too at the time. The Livingstone family were 
participating in the Committee of 300 at that time. One of my Masonic reference 
books states that business at the Holland Lodge No, 8 was conducted in German. 
If so, why were all these other men involved with it who apparently had English 
as their mother tongue? In the 1/1/93 issue, Astor�s dirty real estate deals and 
his activity as a drug king-pin were discussed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">However, Astor�s connivance to create a nation on the west coast wasn�t. 
Thomas Jefferson, who I have now come to realize was a part of the Illuminati, 
was in on the plot. Jefferson said that he �hoped for the establishment of an 
independent nation on the Pacific Coast, bound to the United States by ties of 
blood, language, and friendship.� The Northwest was to become a sovereign nation 
under Astor�s rule. The plan failed miserably due to a variety of reasons. 
Another item that was missed in the earlier article was how John Jacob Astor 
profited by using his own courier system and powerful friends to profit from the 
War of 1812. Astor knew the War of 1812 was coming and he set himself up to 
profit from it in several ways. (His Masonic brother and friend John A.. 
Armstrong 1758-1843 helped the British war effort as the American Secretary of 
War. A descendent of John�s later married into the Astor's.) Astor himself 
helped the British when he could profit by it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The two illuminati Jefferson and Gallatin gave Astor special sailing 
privileges which netted him much profit. When war was declared against Great 
Britain, Astor sent agents to the British forts in Canada to inform them. This 
gave the British advance knowledge of the war, before the Americans troops knew. 
This allowed the British to seize northern American forts and to insure that the 
British had control of the region�s fur trade. This was essential for Astor to 
get control of the fur market, because then when the British furs were embargoed 
he had less competition. He obtained special permission from the President to 
import all furs owned by him and held in Canada before the war. He used this 
permission illegally to trap new furs.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When the war ended. Astor was able to beat everyone else to Europe with his 
furs and make a killing. Astor cleared his name of shame, by sending Washington, 
D.C. information about a mutiny at a British fort which allowed the U.S. army to 
take advantage of the enemy�s weak condition to capture the area. John Jacob 
Astor traded in guns, and his firearms were used in at least one-Latin American 
revolution. Bear in mind Latin-American revolutions have all been planned in 
Masonic Lodges. When employees of John Jacob Astor would trap for or trade furs 
with the Astor fur houses, they would he paid with letters of credit. Then Astor 
agents would he sent out to ambush and kill them, so that the Astor Fur Company 
could save money. The deaths were blamed on Indians. Zachary Taylor stated, 
�Take the American Fur Company in the aggregate, and they are the greatest 
scoundrels the world ever knew.� (O�Connor, Harvey. The Astor's p.44)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="WILLIAM BACKHOUSE ASTOR"><b>WILLIAM BACKHOUSE ASTOR&nbsp;</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This was the son of John Jacob Astor. He was infamous for his hank treatment 
of thousands of people who rented from him in New York. There were repealed 
riots by tenants who were opposed by the harsh filthy living conditions in the 
buildings Astor owned, but their complaints were consistently ignored by Astor 
and their riots suppressed by the police. Only half of the children of his 
tenants lived to age 20. The Astors were deeply involved with the Tammany 
organization. William B. supported the corrupt administration of the infamous 
New York mayor, Fernando Wood. The government at that time was a pack of corrupt 
men. When Wood was exposed, Astors involvement was overlooked. This is another 
example of Astor power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="JOHN JACOB III"><b>JOHN JACOB III&nbsp;</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">He was the son of William Backhouse Astor. He was just as haughty, just as 
cruel, and just as corrupt as his father and grandfather had been. He created 
�sweat shops� for the poor masses living in his New York tenements. He also 
supported corrupt politicians such as the criminal �Boss� Tweed who ran NYC. The 
Tweed Ring stole millions of dollars from the city of New York. Before they 
finally got caught and sent to prison Mayor Tweed and gang cost the city $200 
million. Again John Jacob Astor III�s power allowed his involvement to be 
basically overlooked by the press, while Tweed went to prison for life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="THE CHANLER BRANCH">THE CHANLER BRANCH&nbsp;</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most of the Astors took off for England, but one branch of the Astors that is 
clearly involved in Satanism and the occult is the Chanler family. The Chanler 
family have Astor blood via �Madie� Astor Ward. The Chanler�s parents died at an 
early age, and the Rokeby Estate in NY was given by the Astors so that a cousin 
Mary Marshall could raise the Chanler children. The Chanler family is one branch 
that clearly shows all the earmarks of the Satanic hierarchy. The behavior of 
Robert Chanler, Elizabeth Chanler and Armstrong Chanler have all the classic 
earmarks of having MPD, and having suffered SRA. The Rokeby mansion that the 
Chanler family lived in was a haunted house of the first rate. Fairies, ghosts, 
signs and potents, and all type of occult activity takes place at this 
mansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When top rx-Illuminati members who have managed to escape Satanism describe 
their home life, they mention that occult phenomena was a natural part of home 
life. This certainly is what life has been like at the Chanler Rokeby mansion. 
The Chanlers are not well known publicly but have been part of the social scene 
of the elite. Theodore Roosevelt and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (of the elite 
Cabot family) were good friends of the Chanlers. The Chanlers created the town 
Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. (At some point I hope to do an expose on the 
resort area in that general area that is a �meat market� for the Illuminati. 
Families like the Bill Clinton�s go down there every year for vacation to mingle 
with other middle management families that the Illuminati use as lackeys. 
Illuminati �scouts� watch and choose who they want to use for political office, 
etc.) A Who�s Who of the Astor orphans--the Chanler family who are of interest 
to our study of the Illuminati will now be given.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">John Armstrong Chanler-married mystic novelist and morphine addict Amelie 
Rives. �Once wandering in the twilight she asked wistfully, �Do you think If I 
drank a whole cupful of warm, bubbly blood, I would see a real fairy� ... Then 
there had been the period during which she suffered anguish over the thought 
that Satan was banished from Paradise forever; she prayed with tears that 
ultimately he might be pardoned and readmitted to celestial bliss.� (Thomas, 
Lately. The Astor Orphans: A Pride of Lions p. 76.) John carried on spiritual 
experiments in what he termed �esoteric Buddhism�. Due to his obsession with 
this practice and a business fight with his brothers they put him in an insane 
asylum. He finally did get released. One has to wonder what the whole story was 
behind the incarceration. His esoteric Buddhism or �x-faculty� was a trance 
state where a spirit spoke or did automatic writing through him. His eye color 
would change when this spirit worked through him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Margaret Livingston Chanler retained the rights to Rokeby. She married into 
the Aldrich family, which is another Illuminati family. The Aidriches now own 
Rokeby.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">William Chanler was a friend of Tom Foley who was the Tammany district leader 
of the Irish-Italian district east of city hall. Another friend was Jack 
Follansbee. Jack Follansbee�s cousin was William Randolf Hearst, an Illuminatus 
of the 6� who got Billy Graham�s ministry going by financing the first several 
years. The Hearst family is in the Illuminati. One of the Rothschild descendants 
Don Hearst Bauer, has changed his name to Don Hearst.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In our revisit to the Astor's, we have examined in more detail the early life 
of John Jacob Astor and his connections to Satanism. We have touched on his son 
and grandson who led the Astor family after John Jacob died. We have seen more 
of their meanness and connections to corruption. We examined how Satanism and 
the occult had a hold on England even back when John Jacob Astor came to the New 
World. Three important occult organizations of the 17th &amp; 18th century were 
introduced. We have looked at the Chanler family, a branch of the Astor family 
which is part of Satanism. We also looked at how the Roosevelt's and Delano 
families have been associated with the Astor's.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="Families in the world who are allied with the Illuminati.">
Families in the world who are allied with the Illuminati.</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Who and what kind of family are allied with the top 13 illuminati bloodlines? 
The Illuminati seeks to capture the occult power of powerful occult bloodlines 
around the world. They have intermarried with American Indians to gain the 
spiritual power resident within the leading spiritual American Indians. Various 
Indian reservations are used for illuminati rituals. They have been doing this 
type of thing for thousands of years</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Powerful families around the world participate on different levels with the 
Illuminati. Some participate on a business level- such as the various crime 
(Mafia type) families around the world. Mafia families might not subscribe to 
the occult philosophy but they do recognize power and business. Some powerful 
families around the world participate simply on the level that they have been 
sucked into the world�s system and are dependent upon going along with the flow 
of the world�s system. An example of this would be the King of Nepal. The King 
of Nepal rules over a poor Hindu kingdom. The British empire has done a great 
job in trying to make Nepal dependent upon them. Nepal was given British 
protection, their leading families were given British educations, and their 
leading tribe of warriors, the Gurkhas have been serving as British mercenaries. 
Should the King of Nepal break loose from his advisers and take an anti-NWO 
track, his throne could be taken away via revolution, or invasion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The NWO has the capacity to arrange for the Indian Congress Party to invade 
or some other destabilizing factor. The British MI-6 and the American CIA have 
also stationed assets (agents) in the country. However, the trump card in 
sucking in nations like Nepal , is to create conflict like the Cold War and then 
apply Hegelian dialectics. Many nations around the world have been forced to 
cozy up with the British and Americans, because of the cold war. Secretly 
manufactured and secretly controlled international conflicts are a great way to 
take away the independence of some of the smaller nations. The King of Nepal has 
for many years feared invasions from either India or China.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">However, Switzerland has been afforded the luxury of not having to take sides 
in the Illuminati�s secretly created wars, because the bloodlines have had such 
total control over Switzerland for so many centuries. There is no need for 
Switzerland to participate in Hegelian dialectics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If families are powerful but not in the Illuminati�s clique, they can be 
destroyed such as Howard Hugh was. An example of this is how the Rothschild's 
progressively destroyed the Romanovs (the Russian Imperial Family). But the 
Romanov's were also an occult bloodline, and so the Illuminati secretly took 
children of the Imperial family to serve as breeders for the Illuminati so that 
the Illuminati could channel in the Romanov�s occult blood into their 
bloodlines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The families that control Switzerland go back to Venice. Some of the Pharaoh 
families of the Byzantine have had enduring powerful lineages. The Venetian and 
Genoese banker/international commerce families have produced some enduring 
powerful lineages. Families from these groups have tended toward Satanism 
(Gnosticism) or cults that are not Christian. In this category, we can mention 
Darius Socinus of Venice. Note also that the Warburg's, who work so closely with 
the Rothschild's, are descendents of Abraham del Banco, an old banker in Venice. 
The Warburg's in turn are related to the Rosenberg's of Kiev, Russia. Some of 
your old aristocratic Russian occult bloodlines were the first to financially 
help Hitler�s fledgling Nazi Party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The powerful bloodlines diversify into different last names, but some of them 
still have enough visibility that they can be halfway tracked by their modern 
names. For instance, the Cabot Family of Boston are descendents of Sebastian 
Cabot who was born in Venice. Sebastian Cabot (who father was John Cabot) was in 
turn descended from Giovanni Caboto of Genoa. Giovannia Caboto was a member of a 
powerful family in Genoa. In modern times, the Cabot family has been active in 
politics and intelligence agencies for the NWO. For instance, Thomas D. Cabot 
set up Radio Swan on Swan Island for the CIA. Paul Cabot was a director of J.P. 
Morgan &amp; Co., beside director of other corporations that interlock with the 
Illuminati�s power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Your ruling families in Western Europe tie back to William of Orange. There 
is a powerful Arabic connection to the Illuminati. Men like Sirdar Ikbal Ali 
Shah are very knowledgeable about Arab magic and occult practices. Sirdar Ikball 
Ali Shah has written at least 70 books on magic and occultism. These families 
keep track of their genealogies, and certain members of these occult families 
know the histories of these families.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I believe that a history of the top thirteen illuminati families is the key 
to understanding history. Many of the families which appear to be &quot;allied&quot; with 
the top families are actually related at some point back in time. Further, many 
of the allied families are top level flunkies for the families with the real 
power. Some people have tried to put the Rothschild's in this category, but such 
thinking is nonsense. Not only do I have too many eyewitnesses who have come 
from the inside of the Illuminati who say the Rothschild's are one of the top, 
but one can also point to how much control and wealth the Rothschild's exercise. 
The process of history has been to increase their control and wealth. The 
overall picture can�t be denied. The Rothschild's are not flunkies for some 
other more powerful family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I believe that an investigator will do himself a favor in tracking down the 
ties a family has with the top bloodlines and how that family interacts with the 
top families. This is the principle behind why history books discuss royalty so 
much. All that I encourage is that people investigate Satan�s royalty in order 
to understand how Satan�s realm- the power behind the scenes operates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In the Be Wise As Serpents book I gave a good example of how Satan�s realm 
works behind the scenes. The Illuminati control the Watchtower Society. The 
nominal head of the WT Society for many years was their President Fred Franz. 
Yet, Fred Franz had grown very old, was blind and stayed in his bed. Natheer 
Salih was supposedly Fred Franz�s bodyguard and helper, but all communications 
to WT President Fred Franz had to go through 6�2&quot; Natheer Salih, who would 
supposedly ask Franz and then would come back with an answer. Apparently Salih 
may be from an Iraqi Jewish bloodline. He wears big rings and has expensive 
tastes. Salih was the channel through whom the llluminati could pass their 
decisions for the WT onto the Governing Body and Bethel staff.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(My knowledge and research is limited. So much more work can be done to 
uncover the evil works of darkness that collaborate to destroy the Christian 
faith. Hopefully articles like this will serve as spotlights on the Jekyl's and 
Hyde that ravage our land. And that seeing their opponents better, Christians 
will avoid the many secret spiritual undertows that drown so many.)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In the 1980s one of the most famous criminals was a serial killer named
<a name="Ted (Theodore) R. Bundy"><b>Ted (Theodore) R. Bundy</b></a>. It is not 
publicly known why he killed so many innocent victims. Ted Bundy told his 
girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall that &quot;the force&quot; caused him to kill. Bundy�s 
confession to her was given after his final arrest in Florida. Elizabeth wrote 
down his confession as he gave it to her over the phone. Ted said, &quot;I don�t have 
a split personality. I don�t have blackouts. I remember everything I�ve done. 
Like Lake Sammamish. We went out to Farrell�s for ice cream after eating 
hamburgers. It wasn�t like I had forgotten or couldn�t remember, but it was just 
over...gone...the force wasn�t pushing me any more. I don�t understand it. The 
force would just consume me.&quot; (Kendall, Elizabeth. The Phantom Prince My Life 
with Ted Bundy. Seattle: Madrona Publishers, 1981, p.176)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;The force&quot; is the very term that high level Satanists use to describe the 
power that they believe in, which they believe can be used for either good or 
evil. The movie Star Wars surprisingly used the Illuminati�s term &quot;the force&quot;, 
which up until that time had been reserved for esoteric use by Satanism and the 
occult. This is part of the plan to take the occult and its goals and instill it 
into the public�s thinking and goals, so that the conspiracy becomes an &quot;open 
conspiracy&quot; with the general public promoting the drive toward witchcraft as the 
world religion and its One-World-Government.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Who was Ted, and why did he do what he did? There are a great number of 
unknowns about Ted. And although it appears to the public that the newspapers 
covered his crimes thoroughly, often appearances can be very deceiving. If Ted 
Bundy was related to the Bundy Family of the hierarchy, we could expect several 
things almost without doubt, 1. that his Satanic activities and any occult 
connotations to the murders would be kept very secret by the police, the 
newspapers, and his family, 2. that information about the case and Ted Bundy 
would be closely contained.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Interestingly, when I recently went to research Ted Bundy, every copy (all 
four of them) of the book Ted Bundy: Conversations with a Killer by Stephen G. 
Michaud had been stolen from the Portland Central Library. One of the other 
books on him was also missing, and the other was overdue. The University library 
which is on a different library network was just as bad. I did my research 
across the border in Washington state.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Another category of books that is consistently stolen I have been told by the 
library staff are books on Freemasonry. Consequently, the Portland Central 
Library has a policy that interlibrary loan books on Freemasonry cannot be taken 
out of the library, even though the lending library doesn�t mind if they are 
checked out. Another example of how books relating to Satanism or the Satanic 
conspiracy become rare is when I checked the Thurston Co. WA library�s 
computerized system for Anton LeVey�s Satanic Bible. Of the system�s 18 copies, 
14 were lost (I assume stolen), one was listed &quot;trace&quot;, and three were being 
held by the libraries (that is, they were not out on the shelves).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Before proceeding any further, let me categorically state that I haven�t 
found anything that ties Ted Bundy in with the top Satanic family of the 
Bundy's, nor have I found anything that disproves it either. I don�t know either 
way. Still there are some interesting items about Theodore Bundy. (Perhaps 
someone else will be motivated do the genealogy work, and save me the work.) Ted 
was a law student. One of the schools he studied law at was University of Puget 
Sound, WA. A major reason he did so poorly in law school was the immense stress 
that took place in his life in connection to the time and effort he put into 
murdering beautiful women. Yet, his poor academic performances were no barrier 
to his political success. Ted does have a number of items that seem suspicious. 
First, Ted drove all the way from Washington state to Miami, FL to take part in 
Nelson Rockefeller�s 1968 campaign. He was a big Rockefeller fan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Ted was appointed Assistant Chairman of the Washington State Republican 
Central Committee, Ted traveled in elite social circles, and was preparing for a 
campaign for Ted to run for State Governor. For instance in 1973, he was part of 
the Republican State Committee. He may have been on this committee in other 
years too. (Ironically, Ted Bundy had served briefly on the Seattle Crime 
Commission on a Study of White Collar Crime.) For whatever reasons-whether it be 
elite connections or his winning personality, it is certain that he had a big 
political career in front of him as a young person if he had not blown things. 
Second, almost all the serial killers have had connections to Satanism and in 
every case the media and the police have suppressed or greatly downplayed their 
connections to Freemasonry and Satanism. For instance, <a name="Charles Manson">
<b>Charles Manson</b></a> (Freemason, O.T.O. &amp; Satanism), Son of Sam Berkowitz 
(O.T.O. &amp; Satanism), <a name="Jack the Ripper"><b>Jack the Ripper </b></a>
(Freemason), and Henry Lee Lucas (Satanism). Could it be that Ted Bundy had a 
Satanic side to him? I haven�t seen anything that shows that he wasn�t a 
Satanist. He did join the Mormon church during the middle of time period of 
years when he was murdering innocent women, but his motive for joining certainly 
had nothing to do with sincerely serving God.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I have learned that Ted had an interest in Astrology. Perhaps the closest 
person to Ted Bundy, his longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall, wrote in her 
book The Phantom Prince My Life with Ted Bundy that she didn�t know why he 
brutally killed so many women. She was aware that he liked bondage-type sexual 
arrangements. But the inner workings of Ted�s mind were a mystery to her. And 
Ted was capable of some of the biggest lying and yet coming across totally 
honest. (This type of lying goes on everyday by the Illuminati members who as a 
habit make boldface lies to the public.) Ted Bundy was adopted by his father 
Johnnie Bundy, who was a dentist in the northwest area of Washington State. What 
is this main branch of Bundy�s that we are speculating that Ted�s father might 
or might not be tied to? The original Bundy family came to the New World before 
1635 to Boston, MS. A few years later they moved to Taunton, MS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A large branch of these Bundy's went to Connecticut, and later a few went on 
to New York. Another group of colonial American Bundy's were in North Carolina. 
The particular members of the Bundy family that are prominent in the New World 
Order today, are the one�s who would have inherited the position of authority 
over the family if Satanic tradition had been followed. The Bundy family was an 
old American family that was part of the Eastern establishment, but with only a 
few exceptions like Congressman Solomon Bundy in the early 19th century, the 
family has only come into the public�s eye during the twentieth century. This 
family also surfaces in not so prominent places too. Two of the key early 
Watchtower Society leaders were Bundy's. These were Walter H. Bundy, who went 
with Charles Taze Russell to Great Britain on his May 29-31, 1909 trip, and 
Edwin Bundy who worked at the Bethel Headquarter at the turn of the century and 
traveled around the U.S. for the Watchtower Society from 1906 to 1910. The 
following is my own Who�s Who of the Bundy Illuminati family. After this list 
introducing our cast of characters, this article will get back to discussing the 
Bundy's.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most Americans would not recognize the Bundy family as a powerful elite 
family. However, during recent history two Bundy brothers held the key positions 
that controlled most of the information that was fed to U.S. Presidents during 
the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. When Johnson took over after J. F. 
Kennedy was assassinated McGeorge Bundy was in the key position as Nat. Sec. 
Advisor to determine what the President did and didn�t hear. His brother was in 
a key State Dept. position. Both Bundy brothers were also fraternal brothers of 
the Illuminati Order of the Skull and Bones. Interestingly, Jonas Mills Bundy 
(1835-1891) was a key advisor to President Grant, President Garfield, and 
President Chester A. Arthur. McGeorge Bundy and his brother William P. Bundy 
have held important C. F. R. and important Bilderberger positions. This in 
itself makes it clear that the position and power of these two men is extensive. 
McGeorge Bundy sat on MJ-12, which is the council of wise men that rules the 
United States. (See Be Wise As Serpents chapter 2.13 for an explanation about 
what MJ-12 is and documentation). United States has been the most powerful 
nation overall on the earth, so without a doubt McGeorge has had both great 
public-known and great secret power. The three most prominent Bundy's to write 
about are Harvey Hollister Bundy, Sr., William P. Bundy, and McGeorge Bundy. We 
will now take a look at these three along with Eric Bundy, who was given a key 
position in a sinister plot to steal all wealth and power of Howard Hughes. and 
Harry W. Bundy, who was a chief adept of one branch of the Illuminati.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">His grandfather was a lawyer and a Congressman, and his father was a lawyer. 
Harvey also became a lawyer. But he didn�t stop there. Harvey was initiated in 
the Skull &amp; Bones in 1909. After his law degree he did some world traveling. 
Then in 1914, he began working for Justice Wendell Holmes. Later in 1929, Alger 
Hiss (CFR) also began working for Justice Holmes. Hiss was a communist spy and 
later a key player during F. D. Roosevelt�s reign. Harvey�s son William P. 
narrowly missed having his career ruined because William had financially helped 
Alger Hiss. Harvey had five children. Three of these had ties to the Skull and 
Bones Order also.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Harvey became the Ass. Secretary of State 1n July, 1931 until Mar. 1933 under 
Henry Lewis Stimson. Secretary of State H.L. Stimson was also a Skull &amp; Bones 
member (init. 1888) Harvey�s son McGeorge would co-author a book with Stimson 
entitled On Active Service in Peace and War in 1940. Harvey was special legal 
assistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Harvey became the Special 
Assistant to the Secretary of War during W.W. II. He traveled with the Sec. of 
War overseas numerous times. It is often said 1f you want to know where the real 
power lies look at a man �s advisors. Here we see Harvey giving advice to the 
US. secretary of War and Bones pp. 49-50 where he gives various reasons why 
Covington &amp; Burling are highly suspected of left-wing activity.) William began 
his War during the United States� largest military challenge in history. Harvey 
was one of the most key figures 1n the supervision of the Manhattan Project 
developing the Atom bomb. He was the key Pentagon man. He did liaison work 
between the War Dept. and Office of Scientific Research and Development. In 
1952, Harvey took over the Carnegie Endowment for Peace from John Foster Dulles. 
The Carnegie Endowment for Peace has been a major vehicle for the Illuminati to 
finance tax free various projects. In 1971 for instance, the Carnegie Endowment 
for Peace spent over $2 million, and had assets of $41 million. The stated 
object of the foundation is &quot;to promote international peace.&quot; This is the type 
of peace that President George Bush told the United Nations that the world 
needed. Skull and Bones member George Bush informed the U.N. that a 
One-World-Government peace was needed by the world. Harvey got the job at 
Carnegie because Alger Hiss had been convicted of perjury. John Foster Dulles 
was on record recommending Alger Hiss to replace himself. (See Eleanor, Allen. 
and John Foster Dulles and Their Family Network by Leonard Mosley, p. 311.) The 
various men who run the various Carnegie Foundations work with the Rockefellers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">William P. Bundy started out his career in 1947 working for Covington &amp; 
Burling which is a firm that represents many of the Illuminati in Washington, 
D.C. Covington &amp; Burling appears to have been a conduit for the Illuminati to 
create a left-wing political movement in the US. (Read Anthony Sutton�s book 
America�s Secret Establishment An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones.) 
In 1951 he quit Covington &amp; Burling to begin openly working for the CIA as an 
analyst, and then as assistant to the deputy director of the CIA. His job as 
assistant required him to get Atomic Energy Clearance. In 1953, Joe McCarthy had 
caught onto the New World Order. Although the history books and papers report 
that he was &quot;commie&quot; hunting, If one reads Joe McCarthy�s own words it is clear 
he was gunning for the New World Order. Senator Joe McCarthy subpoenaed William 
Bundy to testify.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Senator knew he could expose a great deal if William P. Bundy was 
questioned, eyen if he might try to lie. The calling card to get the subpoena 
was the fact that William had donated at least $500 to help communist spy Hiss 
defend himself. Hiss�s brother Donald worked for Covington &amp; Burling when 
William was there, and Alger had worked at the firm William�s Dad had worked at. 
McCarthy sent down many subpoenas but Allen Dulles, who was part of the 
llluminati and the CIA director ignored the subpoenas, and eventually was able 
to get William P. out of the country so that he would not have to face 
McCarthy�s questions. The State Dept. was going to arrest William P. at the dock 
as he was trying to escape on the Queen Mary, but Alien Dulles was able to get 
the State Dept. to call off the arrest, and William P. Bundy sailed. McCarthy 
wrote Allen Dulles, &quot;I note your refusal to give us any answers to our 
questions. Your insistence is very revealing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It would seem that the last man in the world who would try to protect and 
hide the facts about one of his top officer�s [Bundy] association with, and 
contributions to, a convicted traitor would be the head of the CIA. I think it 
necessary for me to call your attention to the tremendous damage you thereby do 
to this organization. That the matter cannot and will not rest here is, of 
course, obvious.� (A Biography of Eleanor. Allen. and John Foster Dulles and 
their family network by Leonard Mosley, p.322) Lou Russell who was an important 
figure in the House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) was part of the 
Illuminati power structure. This is something one wouldn�t expect. It appears 
like some of the men McCarthy thought were on his side weren�t. While the 
Hiss/Bundy affair led to McCarthy (a genuine patriot) being killed and 
discredited, someone else who was a socialist and lackey of the CFR was given 
wide publicity as an anti-communist hero from what happened to Hiss. Funny how 
the credit is distributed by the establishment media. This socialist was Richard 
Nixon (CFR). He was given false credit for convicting Hiss (CFR) to build a 
false public image as an anti-communist crusader. Nixon did not do the footwork 
etc., to get Hiss convicted contrary to the false image the establishment 
newspapers and history books give. Later, protected by his &quot;anti-communist&quot; 
mask, Nixon would recognize Red China, among many other pro-communist NWO acts. 
By trying to subject a member of one of the top 13 Illuminati families to 
Congressional questioning, McCarthy had signed his death warrant. It was not 
long before the Illuminati killed McCarthy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">And they have dragged this great patriot�s name through the mud. Skull and 
Bones George Bush was still taking pot shots at Joe McCarthy during the 1992 
Presidential campaign. William P. Bundy commented on the help Allen Dulles gave 
him throughout the Hiss affair with the following words, &quot;I guess there was an 
element of tribal loyalty in the way Allen handled this, that he knew me, he 
knew my brother, a sort of fellow feeling-a feeling for the comradeship of the 
CIA but also a tribal feeling toward a set of people who were in law firms, 
entered government when the need was felt, could be invited back to the house.&quot; 
Yes, that set of people is called the Illuminati. In 1960, William P. Bundy 
while still with the CIA was placed as the Staff Director of the new 
Presidential Commission on National Goals. If national goals are seriously being 
set, then that implies that something is happening above and beyond the American 
people voting at the voting booths, congressmen voting at the Capital, and the 
market place simply functioning. Indeed there is a guiding hand behind events 
which is taking us down a preplanned route to achieve Illuminati goals. Bundy�s 
Commission on National Goals set down goals that are Hegelian philosophy. The 
goals state that the individual has a duty to advance the will of the state, and 
that the state &quot;is to stimulate changes of attitude ... The American citizen in 
the years ahead ought to devote a larger portion of his time and energy directly 
to solution of the nation�s problems...many ways are open for citizens to 
participate in the attainment of national goals.&quot; (America�s Secret 
Establishment. p.50)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="ERIC BUNDY"><b>ERIC BUNDY</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Illuminati uses what is called Hegelian philosophy. A thesis is set up. 
An antithesis (the opposite of the thesis) is then set up, and then out of the 
conflict of the two comes the synthesis. Hegelian philosophy is really a fancy 
term for what the Illuminati were doing before the term was invented. To bring 
this all down to street terms, the Illuminati�s Mafia (yes the Illuminati 
created and runs the Mafia) would send businessmen a letter demanding money and 
signed with the imprint of a black hand. (This was the thesis).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If the demand wasn�t met then the business would be burned or the businessman 
hurt. Then the Mafia would introduce themselves as potential protectors for the 
businessman from the black hand extortioners (themselves). (This is the 
antithesis). And when the businessman begins paying the Mafia for protection 
that is the synthesis. The llluminati are doing this tactic all over the world, 
and it certainly has almost everyone fooled.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mafia strongman Sam Giancana (birth name Momo Salvatore Guingano) had a 
girlfriend Judith Exner that J.F. Kennedy (a member of one of the top 13 
Illuminati families) spent regular time with sexually. Giancana also had a 
friend named Robert Mayheu who worked under Stavros Niarchos of the Onassis 
family. Stavros Niarchos is a Bilderberger and a nephew of Aristotle Onassis. 
The Onassis family, - of the top 13 llluminati families, runs the Mafia. Robert 
Mayheu worked for Giancana and the CIA. Why was a CIA agent willing to help 
Giancana?- well as I indicated in other places the CIA is run by the top 
Illuminati families, and so is the Mafia. This CIA agent, or Mafia man, or 
Illuminati henchman whatever you want to call Robert Mayheu shows up in the 
details of the Kennedy Assassination and the kidnapping of billionaire Howard 
Hughes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Robert Mayheu and other men like him had infiltrated Howard Hughes� 
organization prior to the kidnapping. In Mar. 1957, a wing or branch of the 
Illuminati under Onassis (commonly known as the mob or mafia) kidnapped the 
upstart billionaire and genius Howard Hughes. Now do you see what happens to 
competition to the Illuminati Top 13 families. Either you join the them, or you 
are destroyed. Satan must keep his organization intact. From the best inside 
information I have obtained concerning this area of Illuminati activity, 
apparently two -who were look-alike to Howard Hughes were used. The reason two 
were used will be explained. First, because the &quot;Howard Hughes� (actually L 
Wayne Rector) who on rare occasions showed himself was a fake the Illuminati 
wanted to keep him out of the public eye as much as possible, so it made sense 
to have another double. The natural story was that because Howard Hughes was so 
reclusive, he had hired Hollywood actor Brooks Randall to be his double to keep 
newsmen, and other snoops from following him. When Howard Hughes (L. Wayne 
Rector) would go out, then the decoy (Brooks Randall) would be employed to keep 
photographers, process servers and private detectors away from the Illuminati�s 
real &quot;Howard Hughes&quot; (L. Wayne Rector). It was Robert Mayheu that hired Brooks 
Randall.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">And working with Mayheu and somewhat over Robert Mayheu was Eric Bundy was 
given oversight of the day to day operations involving the control of their 
prisoner Howard Hughes, who most likely died in 1971, and whose public death was 
1975. For those wanting an official &quot;paper trail&quot; see Senate Report No. 94-465 
entitled &quot;Alleged Assassination Plots involving Foreign Leaders&quot;, 11/20/75, p. 
74 where Mayheu�s role is talked about in the death of Onassis. One of Mayheu�s 
top men was Lou Russell, who- besides working for Mayheu, the CIA, the Onassis 
family-was the person who bandied the security and investigative needs of the 
Republican National Committee (RNC), and Russell was with the company that 
provided security for the Watergate complex when it was&nbsp;burglarized. The Russell 
family is a top 13 family. The Russell family will of course have its own turn 
to have an article about them in this newsletter. It is Lou Russell who helped 
Nixon get Hiss convicted. Was McCarthy and Hiss used? It appears so. John Smith 
now puts out the theory contained in his book Alger Hiss: The True Story which 
claims Alger Hiss was framed. So we have come full circle. The communist agent 
that almost ruined William P. Bundy�s career, because Bundy was Alger Hiss�s and 
Donald Hiss�s friend, is now exonerated by a book written by an establishment 
researcher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="MCGEORGE BUNDY"><b>MCGEORGE BUNDY</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Antony C. Sutton does an excellent job in his book on the Skull &amp; Bones Order 
in describing how McGeorge Bundy received preferential treatment all through his 
life. Consistently, McGeorge Bundy got jobs for which there were thousands of 
better candidates. McGeorge Bundy went to Yale where he was initiated into the 
Skull &amp; Bones in 1940. McGeorge then went to Harvard. After this McGeorge joined 
the army as a private. Very few privates ever achieve the rate of promotion that 
McGeorge received. Within a year after joining as a private, McGeorge was 
promoted to captain. Not only was he made a captain he was placed on staff to 
plan the logistics and other details of the invasion of Sicily and the Normandy 
Invasion. That is honestly fantastic. How can a greenhorn without experience 
have the experience to know how much supplies, etc. are needed for a certain 
operation? Bear in mind, that these calculations are for battles in which the 
wrong combination of supplies could mean death or defeat for a unit. As Sutton 
points out on pg. 51, &quot;Can a 23-year. old, with no military experience, 
undertake planning for amphibious operations? The answer is obviously no, even 
if his father (The Order) is in the Pentagon as an aide to the Secretary of War 
(The Order).&quot; After the war McGeorge continues his phenomenal climb from job to 
bigger job, often with no credentials. 1945. He becomes assistant to the 
Secretary of War and co-authors a book with Stimson.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Then McGeorge without any experience or credentials in economics becomes a 
consultant to the Economic Cooperation Administration. Then he becomes foreign 
policy analyst for Presidential candidate Thomas Dewey. Christians may recognize 
from the instruction that the Bible gives that pride warps our abilities to 
accurately see. How much pride has been installed in men like McGeorge that they 
feel comfortable to hop from one unqualified position to another and to make 
weighty decisions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">1949- Bundy was invited to Harvard University to teach as an assistant 
professor and in four years is made the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences 
at Harvard! How does anyone become Dean of a prestigious University department 
after four years of teaching. Not only has McGeorge been treated as if he is an 
instant military genius, an economic whiz, now he is bead of the arts and 
sciences. Bundy becomes the National Security Advisor. From 1961 to 1966 he is 
the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs to the President. This gives 
him great control over what the Presidents are told. For instance on pages 
177-178, Sutton quotes a conversation between McGeorge Bundy, Dean Achison 
(Scroll &amp; Key-another llluminati initiation point), and President Kennedy 
recorded in a memorandum. President Kennedy is lead to believe that the United 
States has deserted its ally of Portugal to aid nationalists in Angola, when in 
fact the US. was supporting Marxist guerrillas (that is communist guerrillas). 
In 1966, McGeorge was appointed President of the Ford Foundation, another 
Illuminati foundation that is promoting their agenda. McGeorge brought in Harold 
Howe II to be Vice. President, a position that Howe was unqualified for, except 
that Howe was a Skull &amp; Bones brother and was a team player that would help 
promote the New World Order agenda with its Hegelian philosophy and socialism. 
Both of the Fords on the Foundation board resigned in disgust at the way these 
Skull and Boners were using the Ford Foundation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="HARRY W. BUNDY"><b>HARRY W. BUNDY</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Harry W. Bundy was a Mason, a Satanist and the chief adept (9�) of the 
Colorado part of the SRICF. To clarify to the reader what this all means allow 
me to inform you about the structures Satan has built. Pure Satanism in order to 
function easier has set up some branches which are secret, but if the public 
hears about these branches, they have a veneer of respectability. Dr. Wynn 
Westcott, a famous Satanist and the Supreme Magus of S.R.I.A. wrote the rare 
book History of The Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. IX. It was privately 
printed by these Masonic Rosicrucian's on Dec. 30, 1900, and later received the 
Br. Museum Press Mark of 0475 h54. Within this rare book the leader of the 
S.R.I.A. spells out the purpose of the organization to the Brotherhood, &quot;The aim 
of the Society...searching out the secrets of Nature; to facilitate the study of 
the system of philosophy founded upon the Cabala and the doctrines of Hermes 
Trismegistus ...&quot; Hermes Trismegistus (as many of you know) means &quot;the trice 
greatest Hermes&quot; who was the Egyptian scribe god who is claimed to be the author 
of all magical writing. Hermes is credited for the grossly evil 
Satanic-witchcraft rituals that the ancient Egyptians and modern Satanism 
continue to practice. For an excellent expos� of the connections between the 
Egyptian Book of the Dead, Masonic Rituals and modern Satanism, I suggest David 
Carrico�s book The Masonic Egyptian Satanic Connection. (obtainable from 
Followers of Jesus Christ, 5220 Ashley Dr., Evansville, IN 47711). As I was just 
writing, a number of branches of the Illuminati were created with the same 
pattern as the Bavarian Illuminati, and these branches sometimes refer to 
themselves as Illuminati-and rightly so since they are integral part of 
Satanism. One branch has been set up within .</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Freemasonry called Societas Rosicruciana. They call themselves Rosicruciana 
and Christians. How they attach the name of Christ to Satanism, is beyond my 
imagination. Perhaps the &quot;Christ consciousness they seek justifies in their 
minds calling themselves &quot;exclusively Christian.&quot; Whatever they want to call 
themselves they practice magic and Satanism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A number of daughter organizations have sprung up from the S.R.I.A. such as 
the Golden Dawn, the Stella Matutina and the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). The 
S.R.I.A. also worked closely with German Illuminism and the Theosophical 
Society. In England the Societas Rosicruciana (S.R.) is named S.R. in Anglia, in 
Scotland it is S.R. in Scotia, in Greece it is S.R. in Graecia, in Canada it is 
S.R. in Canada, and in the US. it is S.R. in Civitatibus Foederatis. The 
membership is very exclusive. And my understanding that there are about a dozen 
US. lodges called &quot;colleges&quot; with about 40 members each, which lends me to guess 
they have an exclusive membership of about 500 in the United States. Membership 
in Societas Rosicruciana has included such notable Satanists such as A.L Waite, 
Eliphas Levi, and Kenneth Mackenzie. It has included that LUCIFERIAN Albert Pike 
too. Within a nation the arena are divided up into provinces, each of which has 
a &quot;college&quot;-their fancy word for a satanic lodge. On Apr. 20, 1948 Harry W. 
Bundy became the chief adept of the Colorado college. Two letters by the Supreme 
Magus of all the S.R. groups Win. Wynn Wescott are photocopied so that the 
reader can read for himself from the SRIA�s Supreme Magus (lending magician) 
that they are connected to the Illuminati. See for yourself!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">An interesting point in light of what I have printed in other newsletters, 
the Mass. college in 1393 printed a book by its Supreme Magus Gould (9�) which 
declares that the Grand Central San of the Universe is Alcyone in the Pliades. 
Shades of Alice Dailey, and C. T. Russell!! One of the most knowledgeable people 
to try to expose the New World Order and the Satanic hierarchy behind it said, 
&quot;It remains for the student to follow every line of enquiry to the point of 
concentration where nil threads are gathered and systematically manipulated for 
the eventual destruction of Christian civilization. It may lend to the B�nai 
B�rith, the Universal Israelite Alliance, India or Tibet, but in any case a 
thorough and complete study of Rosicrucianism embracing a minute one of 
Rosicruciana in Anglia and its various branches will be a great step taken in 
the direction of uncovering much of the political and moral chaos of present day 
history of mankind.&quot; p.510)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Interesting, that this expert would say this. The threads go back to 13 Top 
Families, and wouldn�t you know, several of their people are leaders of the 
S.R.I.A. including Harry W. Bundy. The Bundy family has been a very powerful 
family in American history which has managed to keep itself out of the

It comes via an ex-insider who is now a Christian. If any other ex-hierarchy

which the Rothschild's and all the mother families attend. The meeting is inside

does something financially, such as deal with the exchange of money. I�ve 
noticed that numerous Collins have been Insurance Executives, and although I 
haven�t exposed the connections between Insurance Companies and the NWO, there 
is a book out which shows how that most insurance companies are connected and 
under the guidance of the NWO elite. The Grande Mother Collins dressed in black 
has an ebony and gold moon shaped throne that she can automatically rotate by 
pushing a pedal with her foot. Behind her sits the Grand Council with 13 members 
--this might be or might not be the Grand Druid Council that you will read about 
further on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The difference between this council in 1955 is that it was all males, while 
the council in 1978 has several women on it. The Grande Mother, a Collins woman 
was thought to be in her middle 50�s at the time of this meeting, she had a deep 
dictatorial voice, was small in stature, and was very powerful. She was decked 
out on her throne with a great deal of jewelry. One of the first things done was 
to lay before her feet small gold bricks (shaped like small bricks and made of 
pure gold). Two boys, who were taken to be her sons, one of whom was Tom 
Collins, (Tom was later gunned down by the Illuminati) were near her throne. As 
only the most honored and powerful dared be in the vicinity of her throne, this 
showed that these two Collins boys were powerful. The boys passed out papers, 
which had time tables written on them of things that were to happen. A great 
discussion was carried on about what had happened in the world to bring in 
Satan�s One-World-Government during the last six months and what was prepared to 
happen in the near future. Things that had not gone according to plan were 
discussed. The Ark of the Covenant was discussed, where it was hidden in Africa, 
and a ritual mocking the Ark of the Covenant was held.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Seven children in white were brought in from generational Satanic families 
and presented before Grande Mother Collins. They laid prostrate in worship of 
her. She would move her scepter with a snake up and down striking the floor to 
show approval of a child candidate. Then 7 other children were sacrificed for 
the 7 approved children, one for each child, whose name would then be written 
with a quill using the sacrificed child�s blood. The children were given oaths. 
The Grande Mother rotated her throne and faced the Council of 13 and declared 
(speaking in English) &quot;This is tomorrow�s generation, a chosen few.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The John the Baptist of the Anti-Christ put in an appearance, but the 
anti-Christ at that time was not born or only a tiny baby. Was this Benjamin 
Creme? The ex-insider didn�t learn the name of this John the Baptist forerunner 
of the Anti-Christ. However, the descriptions of this occult John the Baptist do 
match Benjamin Creme. Benjamin Creme was born in 1924, and was deeply into the 
occult and witchcraft even when he was a boy. (See the official newsletter of 
Tara Center Emergence, Jan 1982 Issue.) He claims that in 1959, he 
telepathically received a message from his Master, a member of the [demonic] 
hierarchy. Creme calls these master spirits simply the hierarchy, Christians 
know it is the demonic hierarchy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Because all these things are planned out well in advance, it would have been 
very appropriate if Creme had been at a high level planning meeting in 1955. For 
more understanding on Creme�s Christ the reader is directed to read the article 
on the Sufis in this newsletter. (Referring back to the gold bricks laid before 
the Grande Mother�s throne, there are several reasons that real gold is 
important to the Illuminati. Perhaps in some other article this newsletter will 
go into it all. There have been massive secret gold shipments out of the United 
States and Russia. Guess who is getting it.)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In my 1/1/93 newsletter the names of many top Illuminati are given. One that 
could have been included is Robert Moore Collins (1867-? ) who was a member of 
the Pilgrims (60 of the modern equivalent of the Bavarian Illuminati.) Robert M. 
Collins was a reporter for several important newspapers and worked as an editor 
in the Washington and New York offices of the Associated Press. He did chiefly 
political work for the Associated Press. He was the chief newsman for Reuters 
(Illuminati controlled press) and the Associated Press for many stories coming 
out of the Orient. Although he was born in Wash., D.C., his address as an adult 
became Bournemouth, England. He never married. As those who investigate the 
Illuminati find out, the Illuminati control the press. Here was a man who helped 
do it for them. Last newsletter issue (1/15/93) went into some detail about how 
important the Satanic Societas Rosicruciana is in relation to the Satanic groups 
such as the O.T.O., Golden Dawn, and Stella Matutina. The Societas Rosicruciana 
is definitely a high level exclusive Illuminati organization. One of the New 
York S.R. officers was James F. Collins (8�) who died Apr. 2, 1896. He was with 
the original set of S.R. officers of the first High Council of the S.R. in 
America which had oversight over all the S.R. colleges (lodges) in America. His 
position was Presenter. (I don�t know what that officer does.) When the 
Canadians set up a Societas Rosicruciana in Canada, the High Council which had 
oversight over all Canada included a Collins on its council, Daniel Collins, 8�. 
Daniel Collins had several positions on the council.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The highest degree is the 9�. If you�ve read the Jan 1, 1993 newsletter or Be 
Wise As Serpents you have come across the Grande Druid Council.&nbsp; This is a high 
level Illuminati council. In Be Wise As Serpents in the second section in a 
chapter entitled Heresy Interlocks with Power on the 8th page, I gave the names 
of people who were on that secret Grande Druid Council in the Spring of 1978. 
Each of those people are powerful witches, and have a great deal of power in the 
world.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Yvonne Collins was on the Grande Druid Council. She was a traditionalist. To 
be a traditionalist means that she holds the view that only those people who are 
born to families with satanic power and witches in their family background can 
be true witches Obviously, the Collins family has a long history of witchcraft 
if she holds this view. Remember, that the leading Satanists feel they have 
special blood, the top ones feel they are gods. Even Grande Masters may teach 
their selected children they are the god which created the children. (This last 
statement makes more sense when one learns the methods, state of mind, and 
beliefs of the Satanic hierarchy.)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Yvonne Collins would reject the idea that just anyone can become a witch of 
any significance by training and practice. The occult demonic power would not be 
strong enough for a convert to witchcraft. Yvonne�s occult name is Legena which 
means Lucifer�s bride. Legena (Yvonne Collins) who lived in Virginia, got upset 
with Jerry Falwell, he didn�t follow orders well enough. She got the Security 
and Exchange Commission to investigate his church, which caused the church 
economic hardships. Even mainline Christian ministers are expected to follow 
directives of the Grande Druid Council which is said to operate under the orders 
of the Rothschild's. Everyone who was high up in the Illuminati and are NOW 
Christians remember Tom Collins. Collins was in the Illuminati, but for some 
reason the Lord changed his heart and he began to talk to churches about what is 
really going on. He had a schedule of churches to speak to, of which a Baptist 
church was one. He warned what was going on. He was gunned down in a Grocery 
store parking lot, and has been used as an example by the Illuminati to anyone 
else who dares utter a word. &quot;Remember Tom Collins,&quot; they warn people in the 
covens.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This reminds me of another incident, which happened to a brother in Olympia, 
WA, the capital of WA. Two weeks after Reagan was elected, a beautiful Mercedes 
pulled up to where this Christian brother was working. The guy who got out was 
obviously rich-his suit had to be in the neighborhood of $800 and his wife had 
fox furs around her neck. They said their son was going to work for the state 
and they wanted to look for a home for him. The woman was being Independent and 
said, &quot;I don�t want to go see the houses. I want to talk to this nice man.&quot; The 
houses were done by Donahue Construction. The men went on to look at the houses, 
and the woman remained behind and talked.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This Christian is an easy talker with people. He struck up a conversion 
naturally. He said, &quot;I think its great Ronald Reagan got elected, he�s going to 
be a good president.&quot; The woman replied, &quot;We wanted George Bush to get it.&quot; 
&quot;Whose we?&quot;, the Christian asked to this rich lady who kept tossing her furs 
back and forth. &quot;The Illuminati,&quot; she said, &quot;We�re the enlightened ones, and 
George Bush was trained by us.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, the men had just returned at this point and were entering the 
room. The man with the expensive suit was livid. &quot;Shut your ..... mouth,&quot; he 
yelled. She huffed back, &quot;Well, if you insist.&quot; He then turned to the Christian, 
who he didn�t know, and politely told him that they had failed to find anything 
that suited them. &quot;Thank you very much everything is secure.&quot; and handed him the 
keys. Then he dragged the woman to the Mercedes giving her hell all the way for 
talking, and when they got in proceeded to physically slap her around. This was 
an extremely rare incident. Many of the Satanic hierarchy live their entire 
lives without uttering a word to anyone anything about the hidden Satanic side 
of their lives. As a rule they find very respectable cover lives in society--the 
more respectable the better- to cover their hidden lives. The Satanic rituals 
are always memorized. You will not walk into these people�s houses and find 
incriminating books or objects. Remember Ted Bundy in last issue�s article. Ted 
was exactly the model of bow many top Illuminati are. They are capable of the 
most horrendous things, but to everyone who know them, they are the most 
likable, intelligent normal people.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">People who knew Ted Bundy had no idea what he was doing in secret. The 
Satanic hierarchy and their Satanism is clearly the most secret religion in the 
world. They are a priesthood that rules the world through political leaders that 
they place in power. And because of their power, they have the ability to 
suppress a great deal of the publicity that could arise from their numerous 
activities. To describe the security methods employed to keep high level 
Satanism secret could take an entire book. Let�s just put it this way, if you 
were a billionaire, which several of the leading Olympians (King Illuminati) 
are, what kind of security could you afford? And what kind of clout would you 
have with national governments and police forces to get even governments to 
provide security for you? Remember these people own the press, and the media.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">They will kill, or discredit anyone who exposes them. Don�t be surprised if 
both of these happen to me, the author. Just know this--they can kill the body 
they can not kill the soul. Our Christian God reigns. They also control the CIA 
and FBI. (See Be Wise As Serpents for more details on this.) Many leading FBI 
agents have not only been Masons, but many have been Satanists. The FBI sends 
out reports which paraphrased go like this, &quot;Far more crime has been committed 
by zealots in the name of God than has ever been committed in the name of Satan. 
The actual involvement of the occult in a criminal case usually turns out to be 
secondary, insignificant, or nonexistent. The law enforcement perspective on 
occult crime requires avoiding the paranoia that has crept into this issue. 
Unless hard evidence is obtained and corroborated, police officers should avoid 
being frightened into believing that Satanists are performing criminal 
ceremonies requiring investigation. An unjustified crusade against such activity 
could result in wasted resources, unwanted damage to reputations, and disruption 
of civil liberties.&quot; (This type of thing is hilarious to hear from the FBI, for 
those who know how they have trampled on every civil liberty by investigating 
tens of thousands of organizations simply because they opposed the establishment 
and ruined the reputations of many people- Martin Luther King for instance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">People who have read my book may have picked up that
</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">
<a name="J. Edgar Hoover"><b>J. Edgar Hoover</b></a></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> was a 32� Mason, 
homosexual, and worked intimately with the Illuminati. For those who haven�t 
come out of Satanism, one way to explain to people how Satanic secrecy functions 
is to compare these Satanic families with the Mafia families. Individuals in 
these families learn what they need to know, no more. The top bosses have cover 
jobs, and give their orders orally. (Actually the comparison between Mafia or 
Costa Nostra families and Moriah or Illuminati families is quite fitting because 
they tie in organizationally and were created by the same occult stream of 
secret societies that Satan has been running.) Don�t expect to find what you are 
reading here about the Collins family- that they are one of the very top 
illuminati families even more powerful than the Rothschild's- anywhere else. 
People are getting the inside story for the first time. I am grateful for 
various ex insiders giving me accounts of secret meetings. Except for the 
testimony of eye-witnesses, there is little evidence of what happens at 
hierarchy meetings. There are numerous clues, but they are rejected by most 
people who refuse to accept that the Satanic hierarchy exists.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Before the 1960s, and the space programs man had not seen the far side of the 
moon. But that didn�t mean it wasn�t there. The hierarchy are professionals at 
Satanism and are really pros at obtaining satanic power through ritual, deeds 
and worldly power. Their activities are very secret. In contrast there is great 
deal of physical evidence from the coven levels (the lowest level) that 
periodically surfaces-robes, candies made of fat, athames, altars, dead animals, 
ritual sites, etc. The higher levels believe that the force must be 
balanced-one�s good deeds mast match one�s evil deeds. Consequently some of the 
greatest philanthropists are leading Satanists. The lower levels are not 
concerned with developing power such as what Satan has, they simply enjoy being 
evil, and in that respect are rather crude in their exercise of evil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Collins family hasn�t received much attention. Who do you think of when 
you think of the Collins? <a name="Joan Collins?"><b>Joan Collins?</b></a> She 
was a beautiful, Jewish Hollywood actress from England. Joan�s grandmother lived 
at Brighton, England. (Joan mentions her father being a Jew on pg. 13 of her 
autobiography Joan Collins Past Imperfect.) Her father Joe Collins and his 
friend Lord Lew Grade had an acting company. Joe Collin�s father Will Collins 
and his wife a can-can dancer Henrietta Collins were also into acting. In the 
l970s she was in several horror movies and picked up the title &quot;Queen of the 
Horror Films&quot; (p. 271). In 1977 and 1978 Joan was nude in two sexy films (not 
her first) which were expected to do better at the box office than they did, 
neither of the titles of these films bear repeating.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One was based on a sexy book Joan�s sister wrote that was a best-seller in 
England. Joan was the first &quot;old&quot; woman to be in the buff in Playboy (the Dec 
'83 Playboy). The issue is a collector�s item. In her 40s, she was still posing 
in the buff. Which according to her autobiography she feels comfortable doing. 
(I wonder if being exceptionally beautiful and a sex idol for millions makes it 
easier to pose nude.) For those who watch Dynasty, you'll likely remember her. 
For those who watched Hansel and Gretel, Joan was the witch. She was the woman 
in film The Devil Within Her. In Dec., 1982 Joan was asked to be the mistress of 
ceremonies at Prince Albert Hall before the Queen and His Royal Highness Prince 
Phillips. Besides knowing that she is into astrology, after looking at her 
autobiography I don�t pick up a hint of any religiousness. Besides her amazing 
beauty, her lack of morals made her a perfect fit for Hollywood. Among her many 
friends, she had Sammy Davis, Jr. (p. 332) and Jayne Mansfield as friends or 
acquaintances, both of whom are publicly known to be Satanists. She rubbed 
shoulders with Henry Kissinger (p.3454 of Autobio.) Joan Collins vacationed in 
the winter at St. Moritz, which is an exclusive ski resort of the international 
set where Joan rubbed shoulders with Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis. (These - 
are Kings within the Illuminati.) Joan Collins spent time with Edgar Bronfman. 
The Bronfman family are the Jewish Illuminati family that runs Canada. (p. 
281-282) Joan Collins may not he part of the Illuminati Collins family, but if 
she isn�t she has at least associated with some of the top Illuminati. Joan was 
married several times but obviously preferred her maiden name. Another famous 
Collins is Michael Collins who was one of the three astronauts on the Apollo II.
<a name="Apollo 11"><b>Apollo 11</b></a> was the first officially announced 
visit by man to the moon. For those who have read Be Wise As Serpents you are 
aware that the first flag on the moon was the Scottish Rite�s flag.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There are a number of very strange things about the flight, and about what 
NASA has been doing. Buzz Aldrin is a Freemason. Neil Armstrong has gone into 
seclusion, shunning any publicity. As Michael Collins puts it, Nell has &quot;dropped 
out and doesn�t sell the NASA program.&quot; (Carrying the Fire, by Michael Collins, 
p. 461--The title to his book is based on Greek mythology. The god Apollo 
carried fire, which is what Michael felt described Apollo 11.)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">What our government has been doing with NASA, flying saucers and a manned 
lunar base, is beyond writing about in this article.&nbsp; But the question did 
naturally come to my mind, could Michael Collins be related to the Illuminati 
Collins family? Michael Collins writes about himself, &quot;Fortunately, I have been 
a poor student all my life, and my parents, concealing their disappointment, 
seldom pushed me.� (Carrying the Fire, p. 462) It certainly seems like such a 
student would need some pull to get into West Point, USMA. Michael Collins also 
sits on the board of directors of the Illuminati's Rand Corporation which works 
with Tavistock Institute. He is not even a nominal Christian as far as I can 
tell, he states dryly that &quot;no&quot; he &quot;did not find God&quot; when he went to the moon. 
It looked like the clues were leading in the direction that he might be part of 
the elite, when I can across one sentence that changed my mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Michael Collins wrote, &quot;I feel just as thankful today that I live in the 
United States of America as I did before flying in space, and I have no desire 
for this country to merge into a United States of the World.� (p.470 of his 
book. By the way Michael Collins wrote his own book in contrast with so many of 
the &quot;Christian&quot; authors like Pat Robertson�s New World Order, and some of Billy 
Graham�s books which are written by others with the big name tacked on to sell 
it.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If anyone could promote internationalism (One-World-Govt.) without any 
suspicion it would be Michael Collins, for few men share his experience of 
seeing the tiny earth in the vastness of the hostile universe. And yet he 
doesn�t, he simply advocates that humans learn to cooperate to solve our 
problems- which we certainly need to do. Michael Collins has some really 
interesting and in a sense inspiring things to say about what seeing the earth 
from way out in space meant to his life. What he writes bears repeating. I don�t 
have the space for it all but will share one idea that is novel, &quot;Seeing the 
earth from a distance has changed my perception of the solar system as well.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Ever since Copernicus� theory (that the earth was a satellite of the sun, 
instead of vice versa) gained wide acceptance, men have considered it an 
irrefutable truth; yet I submit that we still cling emotionally to the 
pre-Copernican, or Ptolemaic, notion that the earth is the center of everything. 
The sun comes up at dawn and goes down at dusk, right? Or as the radio 
commercial describes sunset: &quot;When the sun just goes away from the sky...&quot; 
Baloney. The sun doesn�t rise or fall: it doesn�t move, it just sits there, and 
we rotate in front of it, while dusk means we have turned another 180 degrees 
and are being carried into the shadow zone. The sun never &quot;goes away from the 
sky.&quot; It�s still there sharing the same sky with us; it�s simply that there is a 
chunk of opaque earth between us and the sun which prevents our seeing it. 
Everyone knows that, but I really see it now.&quot; (pp. 472-73) (I like Michael 
Collins. What I just quoted is neat. After reading lots of occult garbage, I 
really appreciate someone who isn�t into emphasizing the sun. If Michael were an 
occultist he would not have made this statement. In fact, I think it would be 
healthy for Christians to quit looking at the stars, and realize how wonderful 
God�s green earth is. Praise His holy name! The earth is a very unique wonderful 
marvelous place. And all these people who use their imaginations and belittle 
the earth because they think some other planet in another galaxy is better, 
should do some space travel. The earth is a miracle, and anyone who doesn�t see 
God through His creation is not thinking straight.)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Back to the question, is Michael�s Collins family part of the Illuminati 
Collins family? I have no idea, but Michael himself is not an internationalist. 
The Collins family is an old New England family. Early members of it were 
Francis, Edward and John. (See the genealogical chart.) Part of the Satanic 
branch may live in England too. Like most top Illuminati families, the Collins 
have spread al over - so that even the West Coast has some members of this 
satanic bloodline. Part of the family is both related to aristocracy and to 
witchcraft. For instance, I have a complete list of all people accused of 
witchcraft in New England in the 17th century which includes some Collins, The 
17th century was the first century that British settlers, mostly Puritans, some 
of whom are also known as Pilgrims and Congregationalists settled in New 
England. In 1640 in Aquiday, Mass. a Collins was accused of witchcraft. In 1653, 
Jane Collins was accused of witchcraft in Lynn, Mass. And a Collins family lived 
in the Salem, Mass. area of Marblehead during the 1650s when the witch trials 
occurred.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">They were neighbors to the family accused of witchcraft. Interestingly some 
of the last names of other people accused of witchcraft in early colonial 
Massachusetts include Young, Bailey, Carrington, Godfrey, Hall, Brown and 
Clinton. You will find all of these last names on people today who are connected 
to the Satanic hierarchy (Illuminati) and Satanism. However, the worst example 
of dealing with &quot;witchcraft&quot;, the Salem Witch trials, was instigated by the 
Collins family to destroy Christians. Christians have been held accountable for 
something the Collins family did to Christians in Salem, Mass. My opinion is 
that the Collins family practiced witchcraft before coming to New England in the 
17th century. One ex-Illuminati member who was from the Collins bloodline stated 
that the Collins family brought witchcraft from England to America. For the 
first part of the 1700s, one of the British Collins was prominent for his books 
promoting Deism against Christianity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As an example of some of their aristocratic ties, Arthur Collin�s 9 volume 
reference work Collin�s Peerage of England published in 1812 was a definitive 
work on aristocratic peerage. Obviously, Arthur Collins had a great deal of 
clout to be able to research such a massive work on people of significance in 
England. The Collins family gave us John Collins, third Governor of Rhode 
Island. John Collins was born to the rich powerful part of the Collins family at 
Newport, R.I. John Collins (1717-1795) played an important part in the creation 
of our Federal government, and a role in one of the most remarkable court cases 
Trevett vs. Weeden which set the precedence in court which allowed courts to 
declare legislative enactments unconstitutional. He advocated the issuance of 
paper currency and a strong central government, which made him unpopular in the 
rural areas of Rhode Island. He married Mary Avery. Another John Collins 
(1775-1822) born to a well-to-do Collins family was tenth governor of Delaware 
(1819-1822).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Quite a number of Collins have been well-to-do. The wealthiest Collins that I 
have discovered so far is Matthew Garrett Collins (1874-1925). Matthew Garrett 
Collins was an oil producer. His father was Oliver Cromwell Collins! named after 
Oliver Cromwell. <a name="Oliver Cromwell"><b>Oliver Cromwell</b></a> was the 
early Mason who was paid off by the Amsterdam Jews to allow the Jews back into 
England.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Matthew Garrett Collins was a Mason. M.G. Collins manufactured silk and in 
ten years took the operation in 1886 from nothing to a $2 million business. He 
was president of Interstate Gasoline Co. He worked with several other big oil 
men, such as Gov. Charles Haskell of Oklahoma. He was Trustee for Drew Seminary. 
He participated in the Methodist church. Matthew Garrett Collins oil operations 
and friendship with the governor of Oklahoma are very significant. Inside 
information indicates some type of connection between the Collins family and 
Oklahoma, and Tulsa is a major headquarters for Satanism in that area. There are 
a number of buildings that the Satanists own in the Tulsa area that are used for 
their operations.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Besides Matthew Garrett Collins there have been a number of other wealthy 
Collinses, such as Theodore Clyde Collins, Jr. (Insur. co. exec., banker, pres. 
of etc. etc.), Arthur Fletcher Collins (real estate corp. exec., hd of some 
financial institutions and an financial analyst), Henry James Collins 3rd 
(Insur. Co. exec., treasurer of several financial organizations), J. Barclay 
Collins 2nd (oil co. exec., lawyer, bd. dir. of trustee of a hospital), Leroy 
Collins, Jr. (banker, dir. or president of some organizations), John Roger 
Collins (aerospace co. exec., banker, economist, trustee or bd. of dir. &amp; v.p. 
of a number of organizations), John Paul Collins (banker, dir. of Rothschild�s 
Citicorp Research Corp., plus trustee of a hospital, besides holding other 
leading positions in a number of other organizations.) And finally Michael James 
Collins (not the astronaut) who has been an investment co. exec, plus to name a 
few items-- pres. Fidelity Union Life Ins., pres. Allianz Investment Corp., 
pres. Collins Capital, Dallas, Trustee KERA-TV, bd. dir. &amp; v.p, of the Carr P. 
Collins Foundation.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">None of these men gave information concerning any church affiliation. With 
the other Collins's usually if they do have a church affiliation it is 
Episcopalian. The Collins family also built the world�s fastest nicest ocean 
going ships during the 1850s, for which they spared no expense. The Collins lost 
a number of ships to natural sea disasters, and after the financial panic of 
1857, the Collins got out of shipping, and directed their attention to coal and 
iron. They had a home on Madison Ave., NY. One of the Collins who is clearly 
descended from the old New England family is the banker Atwood Collins 
(1851-1926) who graduated from Yale in 1873. One line of Collins that were 
descended from the old New England family were the father and son who gave their 
names to several locations in Western US. Fort Collins, CO is named after Cal. 
William Oliver Collins, a descendent of Edward Collins who arrived in Boston 
from England in 1630. And Casper, Wyoming is named after Col. William O. 
Collin�s son Casper Collins. Casper Collins died fighting Indians, and so this 
family line died out. Col. William Oliver Collins family were well-to-do 
Episcopalians. W.O. Collins had originally gone to law school, then became a 
Senator, and then was made a Colonel by the Secretary of War at the outbreak of 
the Civil War. Because the U.S. troops in the far west were widely dispersed, 
the rank of Colonel was a very high rank to hold in the western territories 
during the Civil War. Now this article will <a name="list a few Collins">list a 
few Collins</a> who I suspect may have been connected to the Illuminati in their 
time. These are only suspects, but interesting people at that.</font></p>

will give them some names, and let them search. There are some names such as 
Gould for instance that reoccur way out of proportion in Masonic literature than 
the name should randomly occur. Russell is another name that reoccurs everywhere

family was not a common family, but wielded immense power. On the opposite side 
of things, some families have been essentially totally unconnected with the 
occult in anyway.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Prior to the Civil War, the American branch of the Collins family split off 
under the surname of Todd. Numerous occult figures including important names in 
secret Satanism or various Witchcraft groups have had the last name of Todd. 
Presidents Madison and Lincoln were married to Todd's. Lincoln�s wife Mary Todd 
was into the occult. Whether Abraham Lincoln is in heaven or not I do not know, 
those decisions are God Almighty. But from examining the evidence as carefully 
and honestly as possible-Abraham Lincoln was a Rosicrucian and in fact he was a 
member of the Order of the Lily�s Council of Three along with Paschal Beverly 
Randolph and General Ethan Allen Hitchcock. Properly speaking, those Todds who 
are descended from the Collins family should have been covered in this, because 
they are considered by the Illuminati as part of the Collins bloodline. The Todd 
family hasn�t been covered now, but may possibly be written about more fully at 
a later date.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In summary, the Collins family is one of the top Illuminati families that has 
managed to remain low key. It is believed that the Collins family has been kept 
secret because they wield more power than the Rothschild's, Rockefellers, or the 
Onassis's. The only way that I came to realize their importance is through a 
number of people giving inside information, and the only reason that the inside 
information was plausible was the great amount of research I had done in this 
area. And yet what has been done is a drop from what can be accomplished. My 
research shows the family has been connected to witchcraft since they arrived in 
New England in the 1630s, and may well have practiced it centuries prior to 
that. At least part of the British Collins family are Jewish.</font></p>

<b>REVISITING THE COLLINS FAMILY--ONE OF THE TOP 13 ILLUMINATI FAMILIES</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Collins family is one of the most powerful families in the world, and yet 
has been able to hide their power and wealth. The Van Duyn family has also 
hidden themselves very well. But the Collins family is full of tantalizing 
clues, such as one Collins branch that I found in looking at genealogical family 
group sheets. This was a book that Gerald E. Collins� drew up showing the 
Collins family and their relationship to the Bauer family who according to his 
book changed their name to Bower. That is exactly what the Rothschild relatives 
named Bauer did. The name Collins originated in the British Isles, in Ireland it 
began as O�Collins, and in Scotland as Kollyns.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Today, a prominent figure in Wicca is the Wiccan reformer Kollyns, whose name 
was originally Collins Two significant Collinses were Sara Aynn Collins and her 
older brother. Her older brother was a member of the Satanists who called 
themselves the Hell Fire Club. He belonged to the Boston Hell Fire Club. The 
Hell Fire Club has been discussed in previous newsletters. It has been pointed 
out in the past articles how Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were members 
of this purely Satanic group who practiced satanic sexual occult rituals. Sara 
Aynn Collins (bn. c. 1730) was deeply attracted to the occult. Her family was a 
generational Witchcraft/Satanic family, but many of them wanted to abandon the 
occult. Besides not wanting to leave the old family traditions of witchcraft, 
Sara did not want to marry the man her father tried to sell her to. Neither the 
arranged marriage nor forsaking witchcraft was for Sara.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">She went to Scotland to get to the heart of learning the occult and became a 
leader in the oldest form of Wicca, the Elven Path. (Other traditional types of 
Wicca in the U.S. come from Ireland, Wales, and Greece.) After the American 
Revolution she left Scotland skilled in occult power, and came back to the 
United States, where she formed the first Covendom of Wicca. She and her brother 
were powerful Wiccans, and their descendants are the main group of Collinses 
that practice Wicca and Satanism. A wild woman stabbed Sara Aynn Collins to 
death in a Boston store. What you have just received is the important link in 
tracing the Satanic Collins bloodline. Sara Aynn Collins (and there were several 
Sarah Ann Collins in her day-it seems the name appealed to the Collins family) 
is in turn a descendent of Francis Collins of the 17th century. Francis was the 
head of the family when it came over from England. The Todd family seems to have 
Satanic undertones to it, even in the days just after the Revolutionary War. For 
instance, John Jacob Astor married Sarah Todd who had a fair amount of money 
attached to her. The Todd surname is not an extremely common name-until one 
begins researching the conspiracy, and then it pops up with frequency. It is 
known that during the time of the Civil War the Collins bloodline went into the 
surnames of Todd and Putman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It needs to be brought out here that the Putman family also has spelled their 
name Putnam! One genealogy book which ties the Putman/Putnam family to the 
Collins family is Putnam, Thomas Russell (1897). Putnam genealogy; recording the 
descendants of Thomas Putnam. The Be Wise As Serpents book exposed the early 
Clinton family of DeWitt Clinton as an illuminati family. Interestingly, there 
was a Collins boy born in 1824 who was named after that Satanist. His name was 
DeWitt Clinton Collins (1824-1909). Another interesting tidbit was that the 
Phelps family of Virginia is related to the Collins. The Phelps family arrived n 
Mass. in 1630 and became a prominent family in the Skull &amp; Bones. And don�t 
forget men like Skull &amp; Bones William Collins Whitney (init. into S&amp;B 1863) of 
the Collins family. This member of the Collins lineage had two sons, who both 
became members of the Illuminati�s Order of the Skull &amp; Bones. William Collins 
Whitney (1841-1904) and his two sons are the core of the Whitney influence in 
the Order of the Skull &amp; Bones. This Collins blood of the Whitney�s then went 
into the Harriman family. Anyone who has been reading this newsletter this year 
knows how important the Harriman's are! Pam Harriman is the person behind Bill 
Clinton. Further, the Collins blood of the Whitney�s went into the Payne family 
and the Vanderbilt's by intermarriage! The Payne family has been a big part of 
the Rockefellers and Standard Oil. (It is a small world at the top.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">William Collins Whitney</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> 
had a lack luster career as an inspector of schools. But then beginning in the 
1870s, he amassed a fortune from who knows where very quickly. William Collins 
Whitney was the power behind Pres Cleveland, who was his puppet. He also 
directed a group of powerful important capitalists called the Whitney Group. W. 
C. Whitney married Flora Payne. Their son Harry Payne Whitney married Gertrude 
Vanderbilt in 1896. Their son (and remember he still has Collins blood) 
Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney married Marie Norton who later married W. Averell Harriman (unit. into S&amp;B in 1913), the man who helped finance 
Hitler to power.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Harriman's also helped bring the Bush family from oblivion back in the 
early 1920s. When Prescott Bush (George Bush�s father) lost all his money in the 
1929 stock market crash, the Harrimans again came to financially helped Prescott 
Bush back on his feet. During the 1920s, the W. Averell Harriman, Prescott Bush, 
Fritz Thyssen and Friedrich Flick created several entitles to help finance 
Hitler and to produce the weapons Hitler would need to fight W.W. II.. One of 
these companies was the German Steel Trust (in German called Vereinigte 
Stahlwerke. This company produced 35% of Nazi Germany�s explosives, 50.8% of 
Germany�s pig iron, 38.5% of Nazi Germany�s galvanized steel, 36% of Germany�s 
heavy plate, 22.1 % of Germany�s wire, and many other things essential for 
Hitler, if it had not been Harriman�. and Bush�s money helping Thyssen who was 
Hitler�s major backer, Hitler would never had been able to have launched W.W. 
II. Thyssen even wrote a book in the 1930. I paid Hitler (now rare) telling 
about how he financed Hitler and the Nazis beginning in Oct. 1923. As I have 
said numerous times Hitler was of the Rothschild bloodline.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">An understanding of the top 13 families opens up a whole new understanding of 
history. In fact, the full extent of the power of the top 13 families is far 
greater than what I am able to communicate. This is because of their skill at 
secrecy. Allow me to explain. It was no accident that Hitler�s Rothschild blood 
was hidden. A common practice among the top 13 families is to have an important 
child secretly or quietly without fanfare, and adopt the child out to another 
family. The child then takes on another last name, which hides the genealogy, in 
the occult ceremonies, the biological parents will step forward. For instance, 
for Mothers of Darkness the biological father must impregnate the young daughter 
who is being initiated into the Mothers of Darkness. The first baby by the girl 
must come from her biological father and must be sacrificed by her to Satan. 
Many of the Illuminati children are adopted out, (in fact our President Clinton 
was).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">To try and trace the genealogy of the Illuminati is most difficult. What I am 
trying to lead up to saying is that due to a number of reasons-many people with 
last names which are different than the top 12 surnames (as well as the several 
names I�ve given for the 13th bloodline) I have given are ALSO part of the top 
13 bloodlines. Last names are not the criteria--the magical occult power in 
their blood is. It is more than just having the correct blood--but the magic 
power in that blood is critical. Once a branch loses its occult power its blood 
is nothing. This is why even though my wife is a descendent from the Holy Blood 
line, the 13th family, her branch of the family has had nothing to do with the 
occult for centuries, and could never be part of Illuminati.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In summary, this article has given some critical names in the early genealogy 
of the Satanic branch of the Collins family. This article has discussed how 
important events in our world are being molded by those 13 families secretly, 
for example the Collins family. Finally, it was discussed how the Illuminati 
have a number of ways that they hide their genealogies, and one of these is the 
common practice of adopting out a child, so that it gets a different last name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Satanist Bonewitz calls the leading Illuminati families &quot;Fam-Trads.&quot; He 
spells out that Fam-Trads mean the very powerful families that have been the 
actual ones to pass witchcraft down from one generation to the next. Bonewitz�s 
article claims that the only coherent lineage of witchcraft was what these 
powerful families have given us. They were able to pass down witchcraft 
uninterrupted because they were so powerful. He writes, &quot;There is plenty of 
evidence of ancient Pagan traditions surviving under thin Christian veneers in 
isolated parts of Christendom, but there is almost nothing logical to suggest 
that the people leading these traditions were in touch with each other...&quot; How 
did the leading powerful families continue to practice their witchcraft? 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="REVISITING THE COLLINS FAMILY"><b>REVISITING THE COLLINS FAMILY</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Isaac Bonewitz who sits on the illuminati's Grand Druid Council wrote in 
&quot;Witchcraft&quot; (which was a series of articles in the Green Egg in 1976) some very 
interesting statements about the top Illuminati families.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most members of Fam-Trads made efforts to conceal their &quot;superstitious&quot; 
beliefs and Pagan magical systems. Instead they became involved in Freemasonry 
and Rosicrucianism in the 18th century, Spiritualism and Theosophy in the 19th; 
for all these movements were considered more respectable than witchcraft, and 
still allowed the Fam-Trads to practice occult arts ... So as the years went by, 
members of the Fam-Trads absorbed more and more from non-pagan magical sources 
and handed their new information down to each generation, often carelessly 
letting the descendants think that a Rosicrucian spell or alchemical meditation 
was a legitimate part of their Pagan heritage. So even today we have Fam-Trad 
witches who are far closer to being Theosophists or Spiritualists than to being 
Classical or Neoclassical witches. (Bonewitz, Isaac. &quot;Witchcraft&quot; The Green Egg, 
June 21, 1976, Pt. III pp. 5-6.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1770, Lord Petre, Grand Master in the Masonic Lodges in the British 
colonies appointed John Collins to be the Provincial Grand Master of Quebec. 
(Co-authored by a board of Masonic editors, History of the Ancient and Honorable 
Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons &amp; Concordant Orders. Boston &amp; NY:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Fraternity Pub. Co., 1891, p. 225.) I mention John Collins as an example 
of a powerful 18th century Freemason, who was part of what appears to be the 
Collins Illuminati family. In previous articles, we have documented how the 
early 18th century Astor's and DuPont's were active Freemasons. The history of 
these top families does agree with Bonewitz that in order to continue to 
practice their witchcraft they used the cover of Freemasonry.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Later, in the 19th century some of the leading families can be seen to have 
moved into Spiritualism, such as the British royal family, and Mary Baker Eddy 
of the Baker family. Interestingly, H.P. Blavatsky who was involved with 
spiritism started the Theosophical Society and also a periodical named Lucifer 
in 1887. The woman who co-edited Lucifer with her was the medium (now called a 
channeler) Mabel Collins. Mabel Collins later had a disagreement with H.P.B. and 
left. (Oppenheim, Janet. The Other World. Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge Univ. 
Press, p.182.) And it is possible that a few of the Rockefellers joined Lucis 
Trust which is an extension of Theosophy a well as members of the Hall family 
such as Manly P. Hall whose wife was a Bauer (very likely part of the Rothschild 
bloodline.)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This pattern that Bonewitz has pointed out to us, is worthy of continued 
investigation, it is likely that other leading families have also followed the 
pattern he describes. The 13 top Illuminati families are more correctly 
described as 13 bloodlines. The Collins family had a branch that shot off from 
it during the early 1800s which was the Todd family. The Todd family branch 
remained an important part of the Illuminati. We will now discuss this branch in 
more detail as I said I might in the Feb. 1, �93 newsletter.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">**the TODD BRANCH of the COLLINS FAMILY**</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="HOT TODDY &amp; HER FATHER JOHN TODD"><b>HOT TODDY &amp; HER FATHER JOHN 
TODD</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Thelma Todd was known as Hot Toddy. She was an extremely sexy movie actress, 
but she also had another side to her. She was intimately involved with the mob, 
and men like Lucky Luciano. Hot Toddy was intimate with Lucky Luciano, who made 
money from gambling, drugs, and prostitution. In 1935, she was murdered. The 
murderer left her corpse with $20,000 in jewelry on it.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1989, the book Hot Toddy by Andy Edmonds solves the murder, which the 
police did not want to solve and tried to cover up. Thelma was originally from 
592 Andover St, Lawrence, Mass. Her father was John Shaw Todd and her mother 
Alice. Her father had been a corrupted police lieutenant before going into 
politics. John�s cronies would come over to their house to the parlor. By 1915, 
John Todd became &quot;one of the most important men in the East. He was appointed 
Massachusetts director of public health and welfare, a job that gave him carte 
blanche to write checks and approve construction and medical contracts, offer 
political positions on high-paying state committees (most as repayment for 
favors), and pass funding along to handpicked organizations and charities. Many 
believed he lined his pockets on more than one appointment or contract.&quot; 
(Edmonds, Andy. Hot Toddy. NY: William Morrow &amp; Co., p. 56.) In 1925, he became 
a &quot;political advisor&quot; to legislators.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1926, he used his influence to get good reviews in newspapers of the film 
his daughter was in. Hot Toddy had a reputation for going braless, for flirting 
with men etc. She as a teenager had a secret desire to be a madam at a brothel. 
(p.60) She was sponsored by the Elks Lodge in a beauty contest in 1925 and was 
selected Miss Massachusetts. Hollywood even in the early 1920s was full of 
murders, the weirdest sexual habits imaginable, and most of the actors were drug 
addicts (cocaine, heroin, and booze). That was years before these habits hit the 
mainstream of American life. Many actors were homosexual.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Many if not most (the lists I have seen would indicate most) actors were 
Jewish. Charles Luciano was nicknamed Charlie Lucifer, &quot;the devil.&quot; He was the 
most feared and hated of the underworld bosses. Luciano liked Toddy both because 
he was attracted to her and she had a restaurant he wanted to use for one of his 
bases of operations on the third floor for gambling.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Luciano was one of the three major distributors for the Bronfman�s narcotics. 
The Bronfmans are outwardly Jewish and covertly satanists. Remember they were 
mentioned in the previous Collins article being friends of actor Joan Collins. 
Rothstein and Meyer Lansky were the other two Bronfman distributors. (</font><a href="file:///F:/whale/b/drug_war.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">Dope. 
Inc</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">., p. 431) Luciano supplied Hot Toddy with her drugs. At the time of her 
murder, her movie boss had planned to raise her salary to $3,500 a week. Luciano 
worked for the U.S. government during W.W. II, and in 1946 was deported to 
Sicily.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">During W.W.II Luciano work for US. Intelligence--SOE and OSS. (Where else in 
this newsletter have I mentioned the corruption in the Intelligence Agencies?) 
After being &quot;deported&quot; to Sicily, Luciano continued to work for US. Intelligence 
and Permindex (Dope. Inc., p. 483)-which is the elite�s assassination bureau 
which later moved the center of its headquarters to Paradise Island in the Grand 
Bahamas. (Dope. Inc., p.493) (It seems to me that Luciano had connections to 
Onassis.) I noticed that there was a man named Collins who was involved with the 
Illuminati�s movements to take over the Australian economy. He was an executive 
of H.W. Smith, one of those companies that interlock with the CIA, mob, and 
Illuminati. As you may realize, I offer these types of clues because I can�t 
presume on the future and hope that others will assist in putting together the 
pieces of how widespread the satanic Collins family is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="JOHNNY TODD"><b>JOHNNY TODD</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Johnny Todd is reported to have converted to Christ on Labor Day, 1972 
according to one person I talked to. It seemed like the talk I heard Johnny Todd 
give indicated 1973 as his conversion date. He was of the Collins family Todd's 
and at some point after coming to Christ, told people he had been a member of 
the Grand Druid Council of the Illuminati. Before proceeding to tell about his 
life lets interrupt to discuss about whether Johnny Todd is for real or not. 
Johnny Todd has been discredited as a fraud within much of the Christian 
community. If I had heard all the negative things said about Johnny Todd first, 
I might not be writing anything about him, because some of the people against 
him don�t have anything good to say. However, I heard tapes of Johnny Todd speak 
before I heard the negative things about him. What has taken me years to 
understand, he went item by item and discussed. I have tried to understand what 
Johnny Todd did to get discredited, and the central issue seems that a tape he 
made after he was converted had his voice saying a satanic ritual. I must warn 
the readers that I haven�t gotten to the bottom of who Johnny Todd is, but I was 
able to ascertain several things.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Even the people who feel Johnny Todd was a fraud admit he had to have been in 
Satanism-they simply claim he wasn�t as high as he thought.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Every negative thing that has been said toward Johnny Todd that has any 
substance that I have been able to hear can be explained away very easily if a 
person understand MPD. If Johnny Todd was who he claimed he was, then it is an 
absolute given that he had MPD, because that is part of the &quot;training&quot;, part of 
the preparation necessary to become part of the Illuminati hierarchy.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In other words, the negative things which appear to be insurmountable 
obstacles to his credibility, may actually if people knew what being involved 
with the Illuminati is like be items showing his authenticity. Further, it 
appears that after his conversion to Christ, he received so much lack of 
understanding and persecution from Christians that he back slide for a period of 
time, but was brought back to Christ by the repeated message &quot;Jesus loves you.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The clincher was listening to the man. After having done years of research 
and hearing someone tell me much of what I learned the slow and hard way, was 
very exciting. The man speaks like someone who knows Satanism and the Satanic 
hierarchy, and knows it first hand. I have listened to many Christians speak on 
Satanism, and on a scale of 0 to 100 most of them are about step 1.&nbsp; Todd in my 
opinion, from the talks I have heard rates around an 80. If he is such a fraud, 
why is what he is saying such superior information than all the other people? 
People claim he simply borrowed from other people, but that doesn�t hold water. 
I know of no one else who has openly talked about the Collins family. I could be 
wrong--he may not be legitimate--but I feel so strongly from what I have 
experienced that I honestly believe that the man is just what he says he is. And 
in that case, he is one of the highest Satanic hierarchy people to defect to 
Christianity who have been willing to talk. Johnny Todd is not talking now-the 
establishment got him put into prison in South Carolina.</font></p>

<b>EX-ILLUMINATUS EXPLAINS HOW THE ILLUMINATI FRAMED HIM AND PUT HIM IN PRISON.</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This article comes from a tape which was made by someone who is part of the 
Collins Bloodline, one of the top 13 Illuminati bloodlines.&nbsp; I transcribed this 
tape onto paper, because I feel it deals with an important person and some 
important issues. Christians need to realize that what happened to this man who 
left and tried to expose the illuminati, is what is in store for many other 
Christians, that is prison. The Be Wise As Serpents book had an entire chapter 
on the Concentration camps that are already built for Christians.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There are friends of mine who feel very convinced this ex-illuminatus is the 
real thing, and that he was really part of the Illuminati. Then, there are some 
who feel he is not for real. There has been an intense program of discrediting 
this man which was orchestrated by the illuminati and their plants within the 
Christian people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I have listened to both sides of the issue, and then listened to the man 
himself, and I am convinced he is for real. I believe he was really part of the 
illuminati. That was this author�s conclusion, although I�m not so firm that I 
wouldn�t bend if new evidence confirmed differently. I have listened to hours of 
accusations that were leveled against this ex-Illuminatus even before he was 
framed, and most if not all amount to nothing. When I have asked people what 
their objections were to this man, they have said they are convinced he is was a 
Satanist, but that they doubt his illuminati credentials. But the man is part of 
one of the most powerful bloodlines in the world, the Collins family. Whether he 
got high in Illuminati can be debated, but if he were in Satanism, which many 
acknowledge, he would have--almost certainly-- been taken into an Illuminati 
coven.</font></p>

SURVIVOR</b></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Feb. 26, 1991</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I am John Todd, and this tape is being made in a prison cell in South 
Carolina, it is very late at night. All the inmates are locked down in their 
cells, but you will still hear noise off and on. And if the guard comes by, I 
have to stop and be very quiet. The reason for this tape is that I have been 
framed and put in prison by orders of U.S. Senator from South Carolina Strom 
Thurmond.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I�ll go into all the reasons for that, and what happened to me. And only 
recently, in fact just about a week and a half ago did I find out how it was 
really accomplished. As I started to say, the reason for this tape is to get the 
word out about where I�m at. I�ve been in custody almost four years now. I�ve 
been in a prison cell for three years, and that time is a very closely guarded 
secret by the government, by the Illuminati and definitely by the conspirators. 
The word of what has happened to me has not gotten out of the state of South 
Carolina.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Here you have religious magazines that are run by the Illuminati, speakers 
who are members within their organization, or collaborators who have been bought 
by them over the years. Many of them who would consider themselves to be 
personal enemies of mine because of exposes which came out about them by me in 
the �70s- early �80s. Yet, not one of them has said a word, although they all 
know about it for fear that the true believers that are out there will find out 
what has happened to me. When I was arrested, one of the few things that was 
taken from my apartment was my files containing my mailing list. These were 
taken by the police although they had nothing to do with the case I was 
supposedly being charged with.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">And two years later when we went through a law suit to get everything back, 
this was one of the few items that did not come back. They just vanished, just 
disappeared. The reason for it was the reason for taking the two personal 
address books that I had. One I carried in my billfold for such an emergency and 
one was in my library shelf were taken by SLED also. This was hopefully to keep 
me from contact with anybody who could help me obtain legal services or 
whatever. I want to go into the case very carefully, very diligently.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the things that seems to be very frightening to Christians is that 
such a thing could actually take place. Many who knew I was innocent could not 
believe that I had been found guilty. Not so much that -because-, it just wasn�t 
there, it didn�t take place, so therefore even the manufactured evidence wasn�t 
even there. They just couldn�t believe that a child of God in this country could 
go to prison. (I had stopped and came to the door. I can�t let this tape be 
known that it is being made or it would never get out of here.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I want to say this now before I go on, whoever receives a copy of this tape 
I�m asking you to make a copy or copies and get the word out. Make phone calls. 
Let people know what has happened to me. Let them know that they can be of 
service to get me out of here. This is what is most feared about putting me in 
here, that the word will get out.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Let me tell you what all has happened here. We need to go back to 1987 in 
Columbia, South Carolina where I was living. I had been hurt. I had been doing 
labor, construction work, carpenter work for several years. I had stopped 
speaking publicly after my divorce to the woman who had stood beside me for 
years and years and years, headquarters. Give me a polygraph.&quot; Immediately in 
the form of a scream, I can assure you, not a statement, the SLED agent, a Lt. 
Carleton Meddle, who is now a captain, who was made captain three days after I 
was convicted, over promoted- promoted over people in front of him, screamed out 
loud, &quot;No, we�re not going to give you a polygraph.� That was their stance all 
the way through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I took a polygraph after my conviction. I paid for the polygraph. I - the 
polygraph. But it�s not admissible in court. Now they took me-- Pm going to go 
through this all so you can see. Immediately, I knew this whole thing was a 
frame. I wasn�t sure what they were up to I but let it go. The solicitor said he 
wanted to have my apartment searched for evidence of the rape, and that he could 
get a search warrant, but they would prefer that I allow them to search. &quot;Well,&quot; 
I said, ,,I have an attorney who is representing me in the lawsuit. He is also a 
criminal attorney if you allow me to call him, you allow me to ask his advice 
and he says &quot;yes&quot;, I will allow you to do it.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">They really didn�t have a choice in this matter. I was asking for my attorney 
and they were supposed to. They took me in the hospital downstairs to the 
security room. I didn�t know this at the time, but out of the 17 arresting 
officers that were SLED there five were lieutenants in the room with me out of 
the 26 Lieutenants in the state. That�s unheard of. Plus the head solicitor.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It gets better. They take me into a room. The solicitor calls my attorney. I 
still didn�t realize who he was or anything. He called my attorney. I spoke with 
my attorney. He told my attorney that if he allowed me to sign this thing, and 
then again he told that they didn�t have a search warrant, which was a lie. The 
search warrant was limited as to what they could have took from my apartment. 
They weren�t interested in anything in the rape, as you will find out. They were 
interested in other materials, which they could not have took under the search 
warrant. So they told him they will take me straight to Jail, they will go to my 
apartment, and search it. I signed it. They took me to my apartment. They had 
lied to my attorney.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">They proceeded to box up three 30 gallon plastic trash bags and four boxes 
with material. Nothing, except 3 knifes- that they claimed they were trying to 
find the knife which was used in the rape. I showed them where all my knifes 
were and some business stationary with the publishing company. Other than that 
knife nothing that went out of there was used during the trial. Nothing was used 
except what I just said. Everything else was business material, printing 
concerning my past ministry, or the ministry I was involved in which was the 
newsletter. The whole time I was there I was not questioned about sexual assault 
as they put it, I was only asked questions about the Christian underground.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I want to stop and explain that. There is, though some of you might find it 
shocking,, there is an underground in the United States, a Christian 
underground. It was formed over the trials in Nebraska, where Christians, 
pastors, ministers of the church were sent to prison. Where we started seeing 
non-passed laws about child abuse being put into effect by the federal and state 
governments without ever being passed as law. Children were being taken from 
their parents without a chance for the parents to be allowed to speak in the 
trial. All it took was some child psychologist, &quot;I suspect child abuse, blah 
blah blah.&quot; We started seeing how 90% of the people being tried were 
fundamentalist Christians, so an underground was formed. It contained Christian 
survivalists but it contained everyday people also. And all they wanted was 
where these safe houses were, where these places of refuge were, what the 
underground conductors who they were. That's all they were asking me. And yet 
nothing was in South Carolina, So it was out of their jurisdiction. So I knew 
they were asking for the federal government.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I was taken from there to SLED and for the first time I was questioned 
concerning the so-called rape. I realized, you would have to be arrested to 
understand the shock you go through, I was just numb. But as my head started 
clearing and I realized that they held in their hands evidence that they had 
took from the apartment which would clear me, I told them. I also told them 
about my whereabouts that night. I told them people they could go question. And 
here�s their statement, &quot;it is not our job to go question witnesses that will 
prove your innocence.&quot; While I was at SLED headquarters the solicitor who had 
left us after we had left the apartment went and held a press conference. This 
was his story: I was arrested for one rape, I was suspected in three maybe, as 
many as eighty. That�s right. Family members on their way home from work at five 
thirty in the evening were hearing this on the radio. Never before was anybody 
that wasn�t a murderer ever given this much publicity and never before in the 
history of SLED had a person who was charged only with criminal sexual assault 
ever been investigated or charged by SLED.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Before I was even booked in the jail, I realized that these folks did not 
believe I was guilty. They were only interested in something else. I wasn�t sure 
quite yet what. The next morning I was brought before a state magistrate for a 
bail hearing and to be arraigned. I was denied bail on the following. Now listen 
to this. The solicitor tells the magistrate the following, I�m not a resident of 
South Carolina. But he had just searched my apartment. I had several businesses 
in South Carolina and had lived here for years. Further, they said I had no 
residence in South Carolina. And yet they had just searched it. Three, they said 
I had a passport and they were worried I�d flee the country. The passport had 
been taken from my apartment and had expired on that very day on my birthday of 
1967 and they knew it. The next statement was that I had no visible means of 
support. And yet they knew that I did. And the last one was that I had no family 
members in South Carolina, and yet, I had children right here. As I tried to 
tell the magistrate this was all incorrect he wouldn�t hear it. I had not yet 
realized that I was on the front cover of the state newspaper. Now the state 
newspaper is the newspaper in Columbia. It had a co-owned newspaper called The 
Record which does not exist now. They have combined them. The newspapers print 
whatever the authorities want them to print in this state. The interesting thing 
in this was that it started to go into my military record. Now the Illuminati 
and collaborators in the Christian church have led to discredit me for years. 
Mainly they have said that I have lied about my participation in the military, 
what I was involved in, that I was in Vietnam, or any of this.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">During the next several days, the state became very upset at the U. S. 
military because the US. military said I was involved in a military group in 
Vietnam called </font> <a name="Phoenix" href="file:///F:/whale/b/phoenix1.html">
Phoenix</a><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
and that all members who were in Phoenix their military records were sealed and 
in Langley, VA. with the CIA. That is what I have said for years and years and 
years. And after all this, thousands and thousands of dollars paid to the 
collaborators within the Christian Church to Illuminati collaborators and plants 
have put out about me. This newspaper, which was trying to harm me, destroyed it 
in a matter of days. I became known as the survivalist rapist or the green beret 
rapist and it all came out about me being ex-special forces green beret. All 
this stuff denied by Christianity Today, and Logos and all these others for over 
a year was Just blown away in a matter of moments. Over the next two weeks, it 
went from I was suspected of 80 rapes to 100 rapes. Everyday the solicitor was 
holding a news conference. Everyday I was smeared in the news.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In fact when they realized that either what they could frame me of, was 
falling apart on them they proceeded to take my picture and put it on the 
television. &quot;We know he has done all this would anybody who has been followed by 
this man please come forward.&quot; They broadcast my picture all over the state. And 
I imagine-I was told- hundreds of crank calls but nothing ever came out because 
nothing had ever happened. And the problem was, and we�re only guessing here, is 
the solicitor had been tricked by SLED. The solicitor really believed this. And 
he thought it was a high publicity case and it blew up on him and he was 
embarrassed. But he was being asked, we uncovered this. This is how it went 
before my arrest. And I think you will be surprised by the lies [?or irony?] in 
all this. SLED took statements from Meryl Blackburn 2:30 a.m. Sunday morning 
17th -I�m sorry -May 18th Monday morning--(l�m sorry.) It was actually Monday 
morning May 18th at 2:30 in the morning. They arrested me at 3:30 in the 
afternoon. After taking statements, a close friend of&nbsp; who was sexually involved 
with the woman, who was all these women�s bosses, came down to SLED headquarters 
went with them to solicitor James Anders office, and told Anders he wanted me 
sent to prison; he didn�t care how. He then went to the state magistrate and got 
a warrant signed.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This politician, who lived hundreds of miles away, came down here for that 
precise purpose and was involved. His name was Larry Martin. Now the reason that 
Strom Thurmond hated me, in case you�re familiar or not familiar with this, is 
that when I was living in California working with Chick publications and 
preaching very heavily in �87 and doing mostly exposes on everybody it had come 
out about Strom Thurmond being the highest ranking Mason in the world, and that 
he was also a member of the voting Board of Regents for the Bob Jones 
University. Now the first thing that Bob Jones University did was to deny that 
Thurmond was a Mason. But Thurmond wouldn�t go along with it. He knew he was too 
well known as being a Mason. So he came out and tried to defend Masonic beliefs 
that Christians can be that. It blew up on him. And he became so outraged that 
even though Bob Jones University was always calling me a liar, constantly trying 
to hurt me; they had to ask him to step down. The lie was not removed. He was 
only placed to the non-voting board of regents, and, believe me, he still had 
all of his power. At that time, I was told he [Thurmond] is going to get you for 
this. I made a major mistake. I didn�t pray about this. I met, and I let people 
supposedly Christian people talk me into moving to South Carolina. These were 
the first people to desert me when all this happened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Now the interesting thing about this was all through this the only thing they 
had was this woman�s statement. And it came out that woman had first went to the 
sheriff�s department and the sheriff would not believe her because it had been-- 
she was talking about so far back that she admitted on the stand that she never 
had told anybody, that she had never sought medical help. There were some things 
that I don�t want to testify- I don�t want to say on this tape because it might 
offend people but things she described that night would have required her to 
receive emergency treatment in order to stay alive if it had really taken place, 
and yet she said she was not hurt, not damaged, was not bruised. She was not 
cut. She was not harmed in any way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The situation was this, I was held for nine months in custody awaiting trial. 
The speedy trial law here was totally disregarded by the judge. The reason I was 
held so long is this woman moved out of state didn�t want to come back to the 
state. It was not- I believe this- it was not really a conspiracy in the 
beginning. This was a woman who wanted revenge for being fired. When it got out 
of hand she didn�t know who she was dealing with. When it had gotten out of hand 
and become so publicized and she saw all these people running around trying 
desperately to do me in, she ran away. See what happened was that when she went 
to SLED, they typed my name into the computer that they have there. They have 
what they call a black list, a hit list that the politicians in South Carolina 
put people on. When my name popped up it became a field day and it just became 
too much for her, and she left, and they had to force her to come back. Now 
whether she was honest with them or whether they really knew what had happened 
or what I do know. But they completely changed her appearance for the trial. 
They dyed her hair, they put her in different clothes, they restyled and cut her 
hair so that this was how much she changed. I had only seen her a couple times, 
but when she came into the trial I kept asking my attorney when Meryl Blackburn 
was going to be here. I did not recognize her.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">That�s how much she had changed. And so people who would have seen her that 
night which were alibi witnesses of mine would not have been able to perfectly 
identify her was the plan. And the reason for this is that there were witnesses 
who could have destroyed her testimony. But most important is lab tests that I 
happen to know the Lord was behind. I checked into the hospital within six or 
seven hours from when she claims this had taken place. It was supposed to have 
taken place Mother�s Day weekend of '87 and like in the wee hours of Saturday 
morning. And Saturday afternoon around lunchtime I was checking in to the 
hospital. The test on admittance was this test for alcohol and drugs. Now this 
woman didn�t know that. SLED and the prosecution didn�t know that. And this 
woman claimed in her affidavit that I had forced her to drink and to take drugs 
and that I was drinking and taking drugs along with her. The urine analysis 
totally proved her to be lying; there were no drugs or alcohol in my system. And 
yet, and let me say that (O.K.), finally it was brought to trial Jan. 21 which 
was a Thursday of 1988. The jury was selected. A week before I was to go to 
trial I had all the funds that I had left I settled my law suit out of court, 
which was to be $120,000. I settled it out for $10,000 and gave it to my 
attorney who was supposed to spend it all on a private investigator. This 
private investigator was an ex-SLED agent. Supposedly, he tracked down all the 
witnesses I had told him There was enough evidence for, all this time I sat 
there and I knew I was going to be found innocent.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I knew I was innocent. I knew the evidence was there to prove it. And the 
lawyer came and told me they had the lab tests. That they went before the judge 
and argued against the solicitor and got lab tests admitted into evidence and it 
was going to be there. He had drawn as he put it 32 witness�s subpoenas and had 
served most of them, and was going to have the witnesses there and it was going 
to be an open show. And so all day of the 21st I watched the trial not worried, 
and yet not understanding what my attorney was doing. My attorney was making me 
out to be the bad-you see my attorney wanted me to take the stand and say I had 
affair with this woman and she was just upset. And I wouldn�t do it. I didn�t 
know at the time that he was in on it. And if they lost, they really weren�t 
going to lose this case. If they lost, they wanted at least to destroy my 
reputation. And I couldn�t understand where the witnesses were. And I didn�t 
know until this month that they were there, they were just segregated outside of 
the courtroom. And so all day of the 21st I listened to the testimony. It was so 
ridiculous the jurors were laughing at the testimony, that�s how ridiculous. I 
insisted when some nurses were up for jury duty I had insisted they get on the 
stand because they would have been able to believe the medical evidence. I mean 
the medical evidence which cleared me, we won right then and there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I couldn�t understand my lawyer put a woman on the jury who admitted, it�s in 
the transcript, that her and her husband had seen the stories and read the 
stories and had already formed a conclusion. Obviously, if you had read the 
stories the conclusion would have been that I was guilty. Right? And as far as 
the public knew, I was still being suspected of all these, you know hundred 
something rapes, and nobody knew these didn�t exist and nobody knew they didn�t 
go anywhere. So as this jury took, I couldn�t understand it. He said, &quot;Oh, don�t 
worry, it will be alright, I know what I am doing.&quot; The next day we come back, 
[I] still expecting to present a case, the 22nd of January, (1] still expecting 
to present a case. They called up a few minor witnesses. The only new witness 
they put on the case, they were trying to prove that the publishing company 
didn�t exist, that it was phony, that it was a scam to draw women into it that I 
could rape and all this type of stuff. This is what the prosecution was trying 
to prove. There was just too much thousands of dollars yeah, blah, blah, I�ll 
come and testify and blah blah.&quot; Then he turns around and tells my court 
appointed attorney for the Post-conviction that he thinks James Corry, that�s 
the attorney�s name, did marvelous work for me sad did the best he could under 
the circumstances. Yes, I�m innocent but no attorney could have done better for 
me. Making himself a witness who wasn�t usable, but he didn�t show up for the 
trial though he promised. This pastor had files [files?-word unclear] in his 
hand to set me free and refused to use it. I�ll let you draw your own 
conclusions as to why. I did not know the full extent of what my attorney had 
done to me. I was sent to prison. Until Feb. 15, a week or so ago [?].&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At the post-conviction in Columbia South Carolina the only two witnesses 
present were myself sad the attorney for the state. My attorney was testifying 
for the state. He got on the stand sad lied about several things that needed to 
be true, that I need personally knew to be true. Now he had told me up until 
then that the reason be didn�t use the lab was that it didn�t show a screen for 
alcohol and for all these years I had believed him. On the stand however, 
knowing that it might come out, he revealed that it did show a screen for 
alcohol. And he couldn�t give a good reason why he didn�t use it. That in also 
the time I found out that all the witnesses subpoenaed were sitting outside the 
courtroom the whole time for two days said he never called them. Then the 
court-appointed attorney asked him, &quot;Would this witness had contradicted Meryl 
Blackburn ? &quot;would this one?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Would this one?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; On and on for the 
whole time for two days, and be never [?]. And the court appointed attorney kept 
asking him, &quot;Would this have contradicted Meryl Blackburn? With this one?&quot; &quot;yes&quot; 
and with this one? &quot;Yes.&quot; and on and on. And yet he kept saying it wasn�t 
important to present that. It wasn�t important that there wasn�t any witnesses. 
According to law, the lawyer can refuse to call witnesses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">However, the Constitution says I have a right to have witnesses there. Under 
South Carolina law, an attorney can override the defendant and not call the 
witnesses. And that�s what they did to me. So in essence my Constitutional 
Rights were [blank pause], so I was sent to prison without being able to produce 
any witnesses.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Now we left the Post-conviction hearing on Feb 15 knowing that it was lost, 
knowing that it was rigged from the very beginning. About the most major point 
why my attorney threw the case. The Judge cut me off. We could have documented 
it and proved it. Testify. In essence, he took our defense away by not 
permitting me to testify at all about it. Again no fair trial. He said, ,,I will 
let you know in 3o days&quot;. But we knew, we knew at the time, it was pretty much 
open and shut. But then I pretty much. knew that in no state court would any 
court appointed attorney was I ever ever going to get anywhere. This attorney 
should have subpoenaed Rev. Randle sad put him on the stand sad be refused to do 
so. Again not calling witnesses.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There was another brother named Joe in Charlotte who was a major witness in 
the case. He would alone got me a new trial but stating that I had called him 
from the jail after the first day of the trial and told him I needed him to be a 
witness at the next day, for him to take off work to corn on down to Columbia 
and testify. He then called my attorney and my attorney told him not to come. 
This man now won�t even talk to Christians about it. When they talk to him on 
the phone, he�s just terrified, he�s scared to death. under no circumstances 
will be come to Columbia, South Carolina. There is a conspiracy going on here. 
That could be overruled by an attorney. There are a couple of attorneys in this 
state who are known that they can�t be gotten to. And they have all told me that 
my case is open and shut. I should never have went to prison. I could have been 
set free by a couple court orders. But I have never been able to get these 
attorneys. And the reason for me not being able to write anybody, or have 
contact with anybody... (to be continued...in next issue Lord Willing)</font></p>

But I have never been able to get these attorneys. And the reason for me not 
being able to write anybody, or have contact with anybody... (to be 
continued...in next issue Lord Willing.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">CONTINUATION</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">was so that funds could never be reached, could never be raised so that I 
could hire an attorney that could set me free. In May, I�ll have been in custody 
for 4 years. In January, this year I was already in prison for 3 years, for 
something that I didn�t do, and for something that could have proved I was 
innocent, if I�d just been allowed to produce witnesses. In essence I have to 
hire an attorney who will subpoena the witnesses who will make no deal to sell 
me out and will let me have a fair trial. There is something else that you need 
to know. Three days after I was placed in jail without bail my attorney came to 
me. He said the Federal prosecutor, the assistant attorney general, whatever you 
want to call him the attorney solicitor, wanted to make a deal. Now remember I 
was facing a state charge not a federal charge. But this was the Feds. Now all I 
had to do was tell him where all the Christians were hiding, identify all these 
people in the underground, and I could go free. And I said no. It�s a matter of 
record that a federal proffer, this is an immunity grant for testimony, was 
offered me--it�s on record-- and it was turned down.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">After I was convicted in �88 I was sent to prison in Columbia--there are 
several. Kirkland was the name of mine. I was called up front and I was told to 
sit down and wait, that the secret service was coming to talk to me. The woman 
supervising omcer who was on duty found it strange that this secret service 
agent who was supposed to be locally from Columbia did not know where the prison 
was. And she just said, &quot;Boy they are hiring dumb people today we had to give 
him instruction how to get here.&quot; When he arrived he let it slip out that he was 
actually a member of President Reagan�s body guard staff from Wash. D.C. He said 
that he had to leave in a couple of days to Moscow. This was right before the 
Reagan-Moscow trip. And that he had to get ready to set up for the President. 
What was he doing here? And all he wanted was the same information. Of course it 
was the information. Why was the secret service involved? He was a member of 
Reagan�s staff. Now after that, I was left alone, everything was left alone for 
a long time. And then in '90 in the winter of �90, the FBI came. I had been 
moved to a ah- I had been in three prisons. They keep moving me around and they 
are fixing to move me again is what they tell me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The FBI came this was late at night I was brought from my cell after everyone 
else was locked down, and I was taken up front. There were two agents of the 
FBI. They said they were there to question me again, was I willing to talk? was 
I willing to make a deal? I said, &quot;no.&quot; They said all this could be behind me, I 
said &quot;no&quot;. They left. They�ve came back three other times. Finally they quit 
coming. I guess they are getting the message. But I kind of expect them to show 
up now that I�ve lost the post-conviction. As soon as I get notified in writing 
that I�ve lost this post-conviction, I expect for them to show up again trying 
to know if I will make a deal; the answer is �no.&quot; Isn�t it amazing that I�m 
supposed to be this terrible rapist on a state charge that the Feds somehow have 
authority over this state charge and they are willing to let me just go, wipe it 
off the books for turning Christians who are wanted for nothing,, a lot of times 
nothing but misdemeanor warrants, or child custody warrants where the state 
wants to take the kids, or for violations of court orders. A lot of these people 
are on the run, from Christian schools where the state has sworn out warrants 
for these Christians because they were teaching the children, and the state 
decided that this was not right and so on. Little stuff, and yet they are 
willing to let me go for all these people plus the Christians who are hiding 
them out. I think you�d better wake up brothers and sisters, because I was sent 
to prison without the right to a fair trial and I want tell you what. It could 
be done real easy. It could be done real easy. They control the media. They 
could say anything about you they want to say. They control the governments. 
They control the police forces. Wake up!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I want to go into something else that is going on right now in the news. For 
over twelve years I have said that the goal of the United States government was 
to activate what is called Operation Garden Plot and its sub-plot Operation 
Cablesplice. Which was martial law, total military control over all police 
forces, governments, and so on. I�ve said that in order to do that they wanted 
the populace out there to scream at the president that he wasn�t doing his job 
of protecting them from acts of terrorism. And that they were willing to give up 
their constitutional rights. Now we have seen time and time again in order to 
stop the drug wars to stop the drug dealers, and all the bloodshed that they are 
willing to give up Constitutional rights. People are willing to do it. People, 
when terrorism strikes, are willing to do it. Now for years, the Illuminati have 
tried to have the Arab countries be so outraged that they would start terrorism 
in the United States on a great massive rate. And our country is more 
susceptible than any other country for the simple reason that we are not 
prepared for it. We don�t believe it could happen to us. And they thought they 
were going to be able to do it in Lebanon. They didn�t pull it off. They thought 
by hitting Gaddafi he would act, he wasn�t able to strike back. He was unable to 
do it. And now we are involved in a war whose sole purpose is to have those acts 
of terrorism launched upon us in this country. [The media has hyped every act of 
terrorism they could dredge up in recent years.-F.] And I will leave you with 
that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Now people soon you will all be in the same danger I�m in. I�m asking for 
your help. I assure you in the name of our lord Jesus Christ I am innocent of 
this charge. I state so before the Lord and you in his name. I�m innocent of 
this. Is it any surprise that John Todd who did them so much damage will be 
framed and sent to prison? Remember that I warned everybody about it that it 
would happen 2 years before it happened. I was warned. What is so agitating in 
this is that Christians who should have stood by me, who knew I was innocent, 
didn�t do it. They became so afraid that they would be gone after, that they 
just left me here. I need your help. I need copies of this tape made. I need it 
passed around. I need the word to get around. I need anybody who can help to get 
the word around, and to help financially. Not until I can hire these 
non-collaborating attorneys will I get proved and get free. I could be free at 
this time. I could have been free three years ago. I never should have been sent 
to prison all I would have had to do was to have help and never had it. And I 
definitely desperately need this, I�m not very good, I wasn�t very good at 
asking for finances when I was in the ministry. I couldn�t even take my own 
offerings in the church. I need your help. I have a dear brother and sister... 
[name given is no longer working with him--at present 1, Fritz Springmeier am] 
is their name who have stood with me all through this. They don�t have anything. 
They are just an everyday couple, a married couple. The man works he works hard. 
He works long hours. He is not a minister. But they can�t get to him. And he is 
willing to have this [financial help come to him. See, I can�t receive money 
[cash &amp; checks] I can only receive a few dollars and they have to be in a U.S. 
postal money order.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">And if they catch me receiving a lot of mail in here again, they will come 
down hard on me, and it just makes it impossible. This dear brother and sister 
in the Lord will take money, put it in the account and whenever there is enough 
money, move to get my release. I am asking you to help. I am asking you whether 
it is five dollars or a hundred dollars, or a thousand dollars. Please, we need 
desperately. We need to raise the finances. We need to get me free. I never 
understood before as much as I understood now Paul�s writings for when he was in 
prison to the churches for simple things, a coat, a few belongings, some 
finances- people who sent to him. And others who totally neglected him yet 
called themselves his brother and sister in Christ. It was so clear. I am asking 
for your help. I�m sending this tape to a couple of ministers, who after all 
these years I finally got their addresses again. And the Lord has just blessed 
me recently, and I will send this tape out. Now I�m hoping others will make 
copies and send it out. I�m hoping the word will get out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There is no use for me giving you my address for they keep moving me around 
from prison to prison so much I may not even be here before this week is out. So 
let me give you how to send funds and how to contact me if you really feel you 
want to reach me. You can write me, and they will send me your letter and I�ll 
pray about it. And if I need to take the risk and write you, I�ll do it. For 
those who wish to help you can send cash, money orders, whatever, since I�m not 
allowed to sign anything in prison they need to be mailed out to this party. 
[now Fritz Springmeier] And if you would make it out to the party whose name I 
going to give you in a minute... [At present checks can be made out to Fritz 
Springmeier to help Johnnie Todd. Put a notation on the check for what it is 
for.] You will be surprised for a small contribution of a gift of $5 how 
grateful I�ll be. Right now the earliest I can get out [without winning in 
court] is the year 2005. That�s a long time people for something you didn�t do. 
We just don�t have that long. I�ve got family and loved ones, and brothers and 
sisters in Christ that I desperately need to be out there for I�m asking for 
your help. If the Illuminati, Strom Thurmond and them put so much effort to this 
to me, there is a reason. And I�m asking for your help. I�m asking ministers who 
hear this who have newsletters to just simply send out what is going on here, to 
make copies of this tape and to make it available.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">People I don�t have much time left in here. Right now there is a conspiracy 
going on and one of the reasons I hurry to make this tape there is a man in 
prison who years ago who had threatened to kill me. Amazingly, I�m just John 
Todd., I don�t know why they would want to do that. Because at that time they 
were not sure what kind of a scandal it would cause they separated us they sent 
us to different prisons. And they put what is called a flag on my record, saying 
that we couldn�t ever be in the same prison together. Nine months ago, when I 
was fighting to gain my freedom, lawsuits and doing some different stuff myself, 
because I didn�t have an attorney. They got upset at me, they wanted to punish 
me by sending me to another prison. O.K. They couldn�t do it because this man 
was at that prison. And they let me know they couldn�t do it, that our records 
were flagged. Now this man was doing a life sentence without parole for murder. 
Since being in prison he has stabbed four people. Three of them in the last 
couple years since I�ve known him. He has sworn to kill me. And now he is here. 
A few weeks ago, he stabbed an inmate an second inmate at another institution, 
and instead of charging him with it, and putting him into solitary, like they 
had done before, they dropped the charges, and sent him to this prison. When I 
heard that he was here, he was being held up in the lock up in solitary waiting 
for bed space in my unit. He will be just a couple of cells from me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I went to the authorities here and I complained. Surprisingly guess what 
brothers and sisters? the flags on our records had disappeared. And there was no 
record of them ever being there. In fact, they went so far as to say there is no 
record in our records of us being in the same prison together. And yet we�d been 
in two prisons together and in the same building a few cells apart. And its 
right there. That much is in the records. O.K. Complaints were filed and so on 
and so forth. And I looked right at the Captain here, Capt. Byrd over security 
and told him, ,,You did this. You got the man who will kill me. There is no big 
secret about this. This doesn�t happen by accident.� Now at that time what was 
supposed to be done was that they should have shipped me. When I complained they 
should have shipped me. They claimed they couldn�t send him anywhere else, that 
he�s been to all these prisons and done all these things, that this was the last 
place they could have him. Well, they should have sent me away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Now they are claiming that none of the other prisons want to take me. Isn�t 
it amazing that they can�t ship me when this man is scheduled to move into my 
unit into my prison dorm here Fri. This is Monday. They�re doing this to try to 
kill me. What will happen? I�m in the Lord�s hands... [Johnnie Todd repeats his 
request for help]...They are afraid that eventually I�ll get my freedom....God 
bless you. [end of message.] tape was made and quietly gotten out. After my 
September newsletter came out, toward the end of this last month, in September 
two inmates who were paid to stab Johnnie Todd stabbed him in the back and then 
while he was on the ground, they stabbed him three more times. Johnnie Todd lost 
a lost of blood, but he is back on his feet and has returned to the general 
prison population, He is still hopeful to gain his freedom next year, because an 
appeal was won, and now he is to receive his fair day in court. He has an 
immediate need of $800 this upcoming month for a chance to get legal help. He 
has to meet legal deadlines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There has been no consistency among the Du Pont family members in the 
spelling they have employed to write their name. The correct variations in 
spelling the Du Pont name are as follows: Dupont, DuPont, du Pont, duPont, Du 
Pont, and du Pont de Nemours. In English the second syllable is accented. In 
French, neither syllable is accented. The name has tended to be spelled du Pont 
for the family and Du Pont for business. I decided for this article to 
standardize the spelling in line with this tendency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Sitting down to write about the du Pont.s reminded me of two other families. 
Recently, John Coleman, a researcher on the elite, commented to me that when he 
had researched the Queen of Denmark he had discovered that the royal Danish 
family was slipping away secretly from everyone and they were going to Satanic 
rituals. It is also noteworthy that 5 modern kings of Denmark have been the 
leaders of Freemasonry in Denmark, and the Danish royal family, princes etc. 
have been active Masons. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">John Dale wrote a book The Prince and The Paranormal which goes into the 
secret occult activities of the British royal family, especially Prince Charles, 
but also many other royal family members too. Besides the secret occult 
activities of the British Monarch, they have been openly leaders of Freemasonry 
( see the Appendix of Be Wise As Serpents for a detailed chart on this.) The du 
Ponts are similar to these families in that they too are a dynasty, they too 
have a very public image, and they too have a totally hidden life. In fact, the 
du Ponts have better control over the press�s coverage of them than the British 
Royal Family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the clues that the family is a top Satanic family are the frequency of 
marriages between relatives of the du Pont descendants. Few people are aware of 
the immense importance bloodlines play in the upper levels of Satanism. Blood is 
believed to carry the occult power. Unless a person has the correct blood he or 
she will not rise to the highest levels of Satanism. The du Ponts have 
intermarried with the Balls and the Gardners. These other families are known to 
be involved with the Illuminati and Satanism. For instance George W. Ball is on 
the important permanent steering committee of the Bilderbergers and has attended 
the Bilderberger meetings that I know of starting with the original first 
meeting in 1954, plus in 1955, 1957, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1974, 1975. 
George W. Ball is also a member of CFR and the Trilateral Commission. Eliza 
Cazenove (Gardner was a sister to a du Pont. I)orsey Cazenove (Gardner was a 
distant cousin. Will Gardner and Bessie Gardner duPont were cousins of the 
duPonts. John W. <span lang="en-gb">&nbsp;</span>Gardner is a 60 Illuminatus and in 
charge of the Rockefeller Bros. Fund. I have found the Gardners in the thick of 
Satanism and witchcraft.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At the library, I checked out a book Du Pont by William Dutton. The book had 
been a gift to the library from the Du&nbsp; Pont Company. I also checked out a book 
Alfred I. Du Pont by Joseph Frazier Wall. That book�s author J. Wall was 
financed to write the book by the trustees of the Jessie Ball du Pont Fund. 
Although scholarly in appearance, it is what they don�t say that can be so 
crucial to really understand the history of the du Pont family. When a family is 
worth billions they can afford to tidy up their family histories, and keep 
people from spilling the beans about secrets. On May 16, 1893 the press reported 
the death of Alfred Victor du Pont with great laudatory comments. Alfred (known 
as Fred) had been in business in Louisville, KT and was widely known in the area 
as a philanthropist. Louisville�s main paper the Louisville Commercial gave the 
public a totally fictitious story about how Alfred Victor du Pont died, along 
with many pages of the highest praise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If it hadn�t been for the honesty of the Enquirer (a Cincinnati paper--not to 
be confused with today�s national tabloid by the same name Enquirer) the public 
would not have learned what really had happened. The false story� said that Fred 
died of apoplexy while visiting his brother Bidermann. The duPont family still 
maintains this fiction is true, although all the facts of the case are blatantly 
known, and were public knowledge to quite a number of people whose lives were 
involved with what actually happened. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Both Fred du Pont and his nephew Coleman du Pont were regular customers at 
the most expensive house of prostitution in the area, Maggie Payne�s bordello. 
Although rich, Fred was not willing to help support a distraught prostitute 
raise the child she was sure he had sired. So she shot Fred in the heart. 
Coleman du Pont, who was familiar with Maggie�s, soon went down to Maggie�s, 
retrieved the body with a hearse and took the body to Biderman�s house. There 
the coroner was willing to lie on the death certificate that the death was 
caused by <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>effusive apoplexy.� It is most likely 
Coleman made that lie worth his effort. Henry Watterson, editor of the 
Courier-Journal, although he later admitted he knew the real story of the 
murder, went ahead and printed the false story on behalf of the du Ponts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This article starts out with this anecdote to make a point--the 13 top 
families do control the press--and are very sensitive to any negative publicity 
of any kind. Not only are their Satanic activities deeply hidden, but even just 
the normal everyday sinfulness or human soap box drama of their lives is deeply 
hidden. By the way, Coleman duPont, an extremely hedonistic man, is one of the 
duPonts I strongly suspect was into Satanism. Further secrecy has been obtained 
by working through trusted proxies. Today, a key proxy is the Jew Irving Saul 
Shapiro. The du Pont family is represented in a number of groups by Irving Saul 
Shapiro, who is on the Council of Foreign Relations. Irving S. Shapiro is a key 
person who has been the go-between to coordinate the activities of the 
Rockefellers, the du Ponts, and the Watson families (Watson family members who 
are 6� Illuminati are mentioned in the 1/1/93 newsletter. Shapiro was a member 
of Carter�s Advisory Council on Japan-US. Economic Relations, is a trustee of 
the University of Delaware, director of the Jewish Federation of Delaware, 
director of IBM (which is a Watson-Rockefeller business), director of Citicorp 
(Rothschild's and Rockefellers--headed in the past by 6� Illuminatus, CFR 
member, Bilderberger Walter Wristen), and the U.S./U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic 
Council (which Rockefeller plays a big part of). Shapiro is or was director of 
Continental American Insurance Co., International Business Machines (under IBM). 
Irving Saul Shapiro was chairman of the du Pont company.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The biographies of the du Pont family usually begin with the marriage of 
Samuel du Pont to Anne Alexandrine Montechanin in 1737 in Paris, France. 
Although Anne was a Huguenot, she was a medium with the spirit world. Anne came 
from an ancient noble family that lived in Burgandy, France. It is quite 
possible that it was Anne�s bloodline that gave the Du ponts their occult power. 
Anne�s bloodline may possibly tie in to the House of David. At any rate, Samuel 
and Anne�s son was the first du Pont to rise to greatness, and the first du Pont 
that can be connected directly to the Illuminati. Samuel and Anne�s son was 
Pierre Samuel du Pont. Later Pierre Samuel added de Nemours to his name to 
prevent confusion between him and other French legislatures named Dupont. Pierre 
Samuel du Pont was a ge nius. Pierre�s mother taught him to be a medium with 
spirits, but early on Pierre had to deny it publicly. His father Samuel could 
not understand the boy�s genius, such as his ability at age 12 to translate 
Greek and Latin at sight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When Pierre�s mother died when he was 16, be no longer had a parent in the 
family who could understand him, and after getting one of his frequent beatings 
from his father, he ran away, and was spared near starvation by his Uncle Pierre 
de Monchantin. Initiatially, Pierre was a watchmaker, <span lang="en-gb">b</span>ut 
within a short time he attracted the attention of several top Illuminati for his 
ability to write good tracts, and articles that advocated various economic and 
political views that they wanted promoted. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Pierre Joined the Freemasons, and at some point was Illuminized, as most of 
the French lodges became. Although Pierre went through severe financial 
difficulties after the French Revolution, be regularly made payments to Masonic 
organizations in France. Besides being friends with all the famous Masons of the 
time, one Mason brother of his worthy of note is the French astronomer Lalande, 
who helped hide him during the revolution. Someone very powerful protected 
Pierre Samuel during the French Revolution, this is hinted at by historian 
Pierre Jolly, although Jolly never gives his protector�s name. I believe he was 
protected because DuPont was part of the Inner Satanic hierarchy. He was also 
protected by the daughter of Swiss financier Jacques Necker. This daughter was 
Madame Germalne de Sta�l. The Madame was a close friend of Pierre Samuel and she 
operated a famous salon/cathouse. Madame de Sta�l was nothing less than an 
intimate friend of St. Simon. She shared his occult revolutionary ideas. Henri 
de St. Simon was a student and friend of Jacques Rigomer-Bazin who was 
associated with the Inner circle of several occult-based revolutionary groups 
during Pierre du Pont�s time in France. St. Simon was the author of The New 
Christianity which foreshadowed the creation of international communism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">He also wrote in the early 1800s The Globe and The Reorganization of the 
European Community laying out ideas and plans for European unity. In the early 
1800�s, the Saint-Simonians suggested in the early 1800�s that the date 2000 be 
the target date for the New Order. In order to rearrange the world into the New 
Order, a number of items and stages needed to occur. Two canals-one through the 
Suez and one through Panama were needed they said to create &quot;Interdependence&quot; 
between the nations. They also suggested a high dam on the Nile. They suggested 
the technological transformation of the earth, and the biological creation of a 
new, androgynous humanoid. (Androgynous beings are being produced in underground 
facilities-they are the small greys used to fly the saucers!) Progress would be 
brought about by a series of revolutions. (Study from Fire in The Minds of Men 
by James H. Billington to understand how the occult fraternities have created 
all the revolutions since the French revolution.) St. Simon, an Illuminatus, 
wanted to have a child with Madame de Stall which would become the anti-Christ. 
It didn�t happen, but anyway, it is significant that the person who personally 
intervened during the French Revolution and saved Pierre Samuel DuPont�s life 
was Madame de Sta�l. Necker along with Lafayette would later loan DuPont large 
sums of money for him try out his schemes in business and in forming a communist 
society. It�s interesting that the Physiocrats journal was Les Eph�m�rides du 
Citoyen The title has astrological occult undertones.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">On Jan. 1, 1769 Pierre Samuel DuPont took over the journal�s management. He 
became a key leader in France advocating a new order. Pierre Samuel DuPont 
believed in Plato�s idea of government which included a philosopher-king. Pierre 
Samuel was deist. He spoke of &quot;God&quot; but he meant nature�s deistic God, not a 
personal God. He believed nature was a higher God than his mechanical deist 
&quot;God&quot;. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Notice, the Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence also wrote &quot;nature�s 
God&quot;. This is because the deists like Jefferson and Du Pont believed Nature was 
the highest God. The ambiguity of meaning has permitted people to think 
Jefferson was referring the Christian God in the Declaration of Independence. It 
is a common occurrence that Christians assume that others who use words that 
they use, think like the Christians. Even today, many New Agers have an easy 
task to snow Christians. For instance they just say, &quot;I believe in Christ.&quot;

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Masonic reference book 10.000 Famous Freemasons put out by the Missouri 
Lodge of Research provides this about Pierre Samuel DuPont: &quot;When 23 he 
published two pamphlets on finances, which attracted the attention of the 
celebrated Quesnay. He then expounded the doctrines of Quesnay�s school, &quot;the 
physiocrats.&quot; Went to Poland in 1774 at the request of King Stanislaus-Augustus 
[a Freemason] to organize a general system of national education. When Turgot 
became comptroller-general of French finances, DuPont was named 
inspector-general of commerce....He was recalled by Vergennes to assist in 
negotiating with England the treaty to accord independence to the U.S. in 1789 
he was a member of the States. General, but his reactionary views led to his 
imprisonment in 1792 .... In 1799 he emigrated to the U.S. with his family, and 
at Jefferson�s request, started on a plan for national education in this 
country. He returned to France in 1802 and was instrumental in promoting the 
treaty of 1803, by which Louisiana was sold to the U.S.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Pierre Samuel was a key figure in attempts to create a national education 
system in both Poland and the new U.S. A national education system was a 
Masonic/illuminati goal to control education and take it out of the hands of 
sincere Christians. Jefferson, who was a Grand Orient Mason of the famous Nine 
Sisters Lodge, and apparently a key Illuminatus, was a close friend of Pierre 
Samuel and was instrumental at several key points in Pierre Samuel�s life when 
he needed help. Jefferson arranged for the first gunpowder order (which was a 
government order) when the Du Ponts went into the gunpowder business. Benjamin 
Franklin, a key leader of several secret occult fraternal groups was also a 
close friend of Pierre Samuel. When Benjamin Franklin arrived Dec. 1776 in 
France, one of the first people who sought out to visit with was Pierre Samuel 
DuPont. During the next year after that, DuPont was a frequent visitor to 
Franklin�s residence in the village of Passy. In 1783, DuPont expected to sit 
with Franklin at the treaty table in Paris, but John Adams got the Americans to 
sign a treaty with Britian without France�s involvement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">During the second year of Pierre Samuel�s marriage to Made Le D�e, Victor 
Made was born with the Marquis de Mirabeau as his godfather. Victor Marie Du 
Pont (1767-1827) was an aide-de-camp to Illuminatus Lafayette from 1789-1792. 
Whether Victor was a Mason in France before the family came to the United States 
in 1800, I do not know. Victor Marie DuPont soon got involved in Freemasonry in 
the United States after arriving. The following are some of the highlights to 
his secret Masonic career according to Masonic records.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Pierre Samuel had two more sons- Paul Fran�ois (died at age 1 month), and 
Eleuth�re lr�n�e. Eleuth�re lr�n�e followed his father�s steps in getting 
Illuminated. Eleuth�re lr�n�e was a prominent outspoken Jacobin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Duc d�Orleans, Grand Master of the Grand Orient of France, that is head 
of all the French masons, along with two other key Masons Talleyrand and 
Mirabeau started the Jacobins. According to the book The War of the Antichrist 
with the Church (a book made from the lectures of George Dillon<span lang="en-gb">,
</span>Dublin, Ireland: M.H. Gill &amp; Son, 1885) where Dillon lectures on the 
French Revolution he states that both Talleyrand and Mirabeau were key 
Illuminati. The name of the original lodge of the Jacobins was changed to Club 
Breton and then Jacobin Club. The Jacobins were basically an Illuminized type of 
Freemasonry. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The President of the Jacobin Club was the Freemason Georges Jacques Danton, 
who was a member of the famous and powerful Nine Sisters Lodge (nine sisters or 
nine muses is what the Pleiades is called.) Lafayette was a Jacobin, as well as 
the key players in the French Revolution. A very secret body of 300 key 
Freemasons ruled France secretly during this period according to the 
Autobiography of Wolfe Tone (pub. by R. Barry O�Brien, 1893). Robespierre, was 
both a Freemason and an Illuminatus. In fact, he was both a disciple of 
Weishaupt and Rousseau. Prussian Baron Anacharsis Clootz was also a Freemason 
and Illuminatus. He also was a disciple of Weishaupt and understood better what 
Weishaupt was trying to accomplish. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If one studies what these men taught you will discover it is what was later 
known as Socialism and communism. The original idea for all the French 
Revolution started with the Satanic hierarchy. In Nov. 1793, the true colors of 
this Satanic inspired business can be seen in the campaign against religion, 
where anyone who was a priest in France was killed, and the Illuminati posted 
one of Its motto�s in public &quot;Death is an eternal sleep.&quot; Eyewitnesses testify 
that Satan has a very detailed plan which he entrusts to his very select few at 
the top. Much of what seems coincidence and unrelated is actually according to a 
very clever (diabolical) plan. Eleuth�re lr�n�e Du Pont was a major printer for 
the Jacobins. He was a convinced Deist and worshipped nature too.</font></p>

his death. He was born in France, and become a sea captain. Where his money came 
from is somewhat of a mystery. He gave large sums of his money to Masonic

plans. Part of the plans were to create a new society. While<span lang="en-gb">
</span>Victor Marie and his father pursued grandiose schemes that tailed 
miserably, Eleuth�re lr�n�e DuPont started a gunpowder business in Delaware. 
Ir�n�e�s success can be attributed to several factors:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">�The french government gave him top secret machinery and plans to produce the 
best gunpowder possible in that day. It was state-of-the-art technology, and 
they supplied manpower to help get started.</font></p>

I do not know which particular men have served during the Satanic rituals. The 
family has always had a head of the family. It may be that the most powerful 
DuPont may also secretly serve as the highest Satanist. I don�t know who has 
been representing the family at the highest levels of secret Satanism (I suspect 
or surmise it has not been the public head of the family in modern times), but I 
can list the public head of the family as it passed down through time:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">These men had great authority over the tribe of duPonts. The du Ponts had 
family council where even the women had voting rights. The DuPonts, like the 
Rothschild's helped set up their children�s marriages, and many of the early 
ones were to cousins. For instance, much to the delight of the duPonts, Sophie 
Madeleine du Pont married her cousin Samuel Prancis DuPont in 1833. (2 of 
Sophie�s drawing occur later in this article.) The family owned everything in 
common, and distributed according to needs and according to the contribution 
that each could give to the family business. The James Bidderman, the son of 
Evelina DuPont Bidderman, went to France and his decedents would give the 
DuPonts a lineage in France. One of the families that Intermarried and were 
close friends with the DuPonts was the Cazenoves family. Both families were 
close friends with Thomas Jefferson and Albert Gallatin, I have concluded that 
both Thomas Jefferson and Albert Gallatin were Illuminati. Further, I discovered 
in a forty volume set on American Statesmen in vol. 13, p.386 that Albert 
Gallatin claimed to be descended from the ancient Roman Consul Callatinus. 
Incredible as it may seem, the black nobility have kept track of their 
bloodlines. The same people ruling the world today are in many ways the 
descendants of the rulers in past ages. Antoine Charles Cazenove, born in 
Geneva, Sw. was a business partner with Albert Gallatin. During the War of 1812, 
the DuPont gunpowder factory since it was the primary American powder company 
was the known target for the British to destroy. However, the British never 
attacked it. The Du Ponts had organized a local militia called the Brandywine 
Rangers. Interestingly, their militia flag was a beehive on white silk. 
Lafayette visited the DuPonts in Delaware the summer of 1825.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Another important Mason who would visit the DuPonts was Henry Clay who was 
the American Secretary of State and head of the whig party. Henry Clay was Grand 
Master of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky and GranD Orator for the G.L. 1806-09. He 
was one of the Freemasons involved in a high level meeting that used the U.S. 
Senate Chambers on Mar. 9, 1822 for their meeting. If the duPonts were already 
one of the primary top families, it may well be Clay was coming to them for 
guidance on how to steer the nation. The duPonts played a role too in the 
building of the American capital, which was laid out and constructed with 
numerous occult patterns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Eleuth�re lr�n�e du Pont had a daughter Sophie Madeleine du Pont (1810-1888). 
Sophie was also her mothers name. Sophie Madeleine du Pont (her name 
Sophie/Sophia is popular with Moriah) wrote diaries, journal voluminous 
correspondence. Sophie also drew hundreds are drawings and sketches, many of 
them characters of people. Of her sketches, this article reproduces two of them 
which bear importance to this newsletter. The first is a drawing by Sophie du 
Pont of one of the duPonts dressed up like Satan with long paper horns and a 
tail. Interestingly, according to a 12/12/1829 letter by Sophie to one of her 
relatives Sophie comments that the costume of Satan was mistaken &quot;for Old Nick.&quot; 
(See the article on Saturn in this newsletter for evidence of the connection 
between Satan and Santa.) The next drawing is a drawing that went with a letter 
from Sophie to Clementina Smith, 21 July 1837 which is a self-portrait of what 
Sophie calls &quot;blackies&quot; (black servants) who &quot;toted&quot; (carried) her to her bath 
in a special chair. This drawing is included to show how wealthy the DuPonts 
were within a short time after coming to Delaware, U.S.A. Alfred Victor DuPont, 
who took over as head of both the family and the factories making gunpowder, was 
married to Meta.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Meta was into Swedenborgianism, which was a type of mystical religious 
Freemasonry, that was based on the Swedish mason Swedenborg�s teachings. Alfred 
Victor apparently didn�t feel anything negative toward this. His wife Meta 
organized a Swedenborg church in town. Around the Civil War times, the DuPonts 
became less identified with Deism and more Identified with the Episcopal church. 
Joanna Smith DuPont was Instrumental in this change. One of the families that 
the DuPonts would marry with was the Cazenoves, who were Episcopalians, and some 
members were I suspect involved with the Illuminati. Christ Church was built off 
the DuPont communal property for Episcopal services. By the Civil War, the state 
of Delaware was lock-stock-and-barrel under the control of the DuPonts and their 
friends the Bayards, the Saulsburys, and the Greys, in this 20th century, the 
DuPonts have gotten firmer control. Because the state of Delaware is controlled 
by the DuPonts, et. al, it is worthwhile to examine some of the people the 
DuPonts and their elite friends have placed into office. This is a very 
unfinished skimpy list, I have done only a little research in this direction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The DuPont gunpowder factories dominated the industry. Within only a short 
time after getting started in 1802 they had the best quality gunpowder in the 
world for the general market. Every war the United States has fought starting in 
1802 with the war against Tripoli (today Ubya) and the Barbary Pirates until the 
incursion Into Somolia this last year the American military has depended upon 
DuPont gunpowder. Henry du Pont (1812-1889) took over command of the gunpowder 
manufacturing when he was thirty-eight. He was very authoritarian and was known 
as Boss Henry. His narrow-minded, backward and authoritarian thinking ran the 
DuPont company into the ground in spite of their control of the gunpowder 
market. When he died, Alfred I. duPont, Pierre Samuel du Pont II (1870-1954), 
and Thomas Coleman du Pont (1863-1930) took over various DuPont manufacturing 
affairs. This triumvirate revived the aging Du Pont factories. They bought out 
the rest of the gunpowder manufacturers, giving them an absolute monopoly in the 
munitions industry. They modernized the DuPont factories and put the DuPont 
businesses back Into top shape.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">On August 22, 1857 the du Ponts lost their first family member to an 
explosion, Alexis duPont. The duPonts had always bee<span lang="en-gb">n</span> 
in the forefront on safety at their gunpowder factories, but that did not 
prevent them from having to suffer repeated explosions over the years. An 
explosion at a gunpowder factory is easily set off and very deadly. The tutor 
that was hired in 1852 to tutor the DuPont children, R. Page Williamson, 
described in his letters to Virginia that the duPont children were very spoiled 
and difficult to work with. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1872, Henry duPont brought together Laflin &amp; Rand and Hazard Powder Co. in 
order to form a Gun Powder Trade Association. What the Association did was to 
eliminate competition between the three largest manufacturers of gunpowder, and 
create a monopoly for this cartel. Eventually DuPont bought out the other two 
plus numerous other small gunpowder companies. I suggest that everyone who 
believes that the DuPonts and the rest of the elite are capitalists, should take 
another look at history. These men do not believe in capitalism, they believe in 
monopolies--which boils down to the same thing that occurs under communism. When 
these people described their setting up a monopoly they call it &quot;bringing order 
and stability to a fragmented and chaotic industry.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1889, Alfred I. du Pont attempted to bribe French officers in charge of 
the production of smokeless gunpowder to give the secrets to him. But no amount 
of bribe would work, as the Frenchmen knew they would lose their lives if they 
gave the secrets to him. The British were not any more helpful. Ufe was not all 
peaches and cream. Fred was murdered. William du Pont (1855-1928) was trapped in 
a marriage with a duPont cousin, May du Pont, that he didn't want to be married 
to. Louis Cazenove du Pout a handsome, intelligent young - committed suicide 
with a bullet in the library at the Wilmington Club. Alfred was shot in the face 
by accident on a hunting trip. The duPont family had their share of heartaches, 
broken marriages, insanity, etc. When Mary Belin married into the family she 
brought some Jewish blood. As a major part of the budding military industrial 
complex the DuPonts during the 19th century had to work with the army and navy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The army and navy convinced them to Implement a contract with the Coopal Co. 
in Belgium for smokeless powder, which when the formula was received was found 
to be inferior to what the American were already producing. However, this whole 
episode ended with the DuPonts going with their own formula and setting up a new 
plant at Carney�s Point, New Jersey. This hits the highlights of the family 
history in their first 100 years in this nation. To celebrate their first 
hundred years, every living descendent of the first Pierre Samuel was invited to 
a great banquet. A building was built to house them. They numbered over 100. At 
each person�s table setting was a special gift of a gold coin, prepared 
especially to commemorate this centennial. On Jan. 1, 1900, the DuPont tribe 
celebrated. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The DuPonts are shrouded in so much secrecy, that their secrecy is not even 
known. When Eugene DuPont, the chief executive of the family gunpowder/high 
explosive business died near the turn of the century, none of the other DuPonts 
hardly even a vague idea of how much the company was worth or what assets it 
had. (At that time the DuPonts had powder plants in PA, DEL, Iowa, and TN. The 
DuPonts are much the same today, except that their assets are perhaps ten times 
better hidden, not only from outsiders but from themselves. The DuPonts have in 
general made their money the hard way-by working and producing, in contrast to 
the other top families. The DuPonts are to be commended on this, even If at 
times they have been very tight on what they have given their workers. The 
DuPonts have also shown an amazing ability to keep their dynasty alive. There 
seems to be an increasing invisibility to their family.</font></p>

representatives concerned for the welfare and safety of the United States, 
because, according to testimony on record, the Society of Cincinnati was &quot;the 
beginning of a hereditary aristocracy in the U.S. dedicated to subverting the 
Republic.&quot; The Massachusetts Legislature declared the Society of the Cincinnati 
&quot;dangerous.&quot; And yet speaking for the public for all the legislators trouble, 
the truth is nobody has even heard of the Society of the Cincinnati, let alone 
known or guessed it was dangerous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When the United States was created it operated under the Articles of 
Confederation. It was a confederation of Independent states-each of the states 
printed their - money, passed their own laws, etc. The federal government was 
simply a League of Nations-type body. The Society of the Cincinnati was partly 
responsible for getting that changed. The Society of Cincinnati favored a very 
strong central government, a national bank, etc. The Freemason Baron von Steuben 
is credited with starting the organization. The Mason Pierre L�Enfant who 
designed the City of Washington with its hidden occult symbols also designed the 
logo for the Society of the Cincinnati. Every president of the United States has 
worn the Diamond Eagle jewel of the Society of the Cincinnati. Wow. And I hadn�t 
even heard about it until I got this tip from this ex-illuminatus. Benjamin 
Franklin was an honorary member. The Marquis de Lafayette was a member. George 
Washington and James Monroe were Original Members. At least 15 Presidents have 
been honorary members. Pres. Franklin Pierce and Zachery Taylor (his father was 
an Original Member) were hereditary members. Many of the high ranking Masons who 
were also officers in the Revolution were Original Members. Three prominent 
Freemasons who were big in the Society of the Cincinnati were Henry Beekman 
Livingston (1750-1831), James Mann (1759-1832), and Hardy Murfee (1752-1809).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hardy served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina beginning 
in 1789. I noticed that many very busy elite People were spending a lot of money 
and time on this Society, whatever its purpose was. The Society had a museum, 
and a headquarters building in Washington, D.C. on Massachusetts Ave, N.W., and 
state chapters. But why? The stated purpose of the organization didn't seem to 
explain the interest people put into the organization. Why spend time belonging 
to an organization whose only purpose is to commemorate the fact that all Its 
members are descendents of Revolutionary War officers? The purpose of the 
organization is &quot;To render permanent the cordial affection subsisting among the 
officers.&quot; O.K. I can understand a group of officers who are all veterans of a 
war getting together. But their descendents? We are talking about a war whose 
fighting basically ended in 1781. That�s over 200 years ago. Would my busy 
descendents care to visit with some other Vietnam vets� great-great-great 
grandchildren 200 years from now? Yet, my 1983 World Almanac (which lists in 
fine print about 1,300 associations) gives the membership of the Society of the 
Cincinnati at 2,800. Other sources indicated that the organization had an 
affiliate organization in France. But how? How could an organization which was 
open to only descendents of select Revolutionary Officers be so Identical in 
purpose to something in France for Frenchmen?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I could understand why, but only If the stated purposes were not the whole 
story. As you can see I was very suspicious of the Society of the Cincinnati, it 
appears I had stumbled onto something big. But I hadn�t been able to tie the 
Society in with the Illuminati-until I stepped up my research on the duPonts. 
The tie-in between the Illuminati and the Society of the Cincinnati came when I 
began investigating what I thought might turn out to be an obscure Person. His 
name was Leighton Coleman (1837-19??) and he was married to Francis (Fanny) 
Elizabeth, daughter of Alexis Iren�e du Pont (1816-57). Alexis died in an 
accident. Occult bloodline power can pass through women or men, so it was worth 
it to investigate Leighton Coleman. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Leighton Coleman turned out to be the Bishop of the State of Delaware for the 
Episcopal Church. He was a prime mover in the temperance movement (which I had 
already discovered was Illuminati controlled). Further Leighton was grand 
chaplain of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons in Pennsylvania, Grand Prelate of the 
Knights Templar, and chaplain of the Delaware Society of the Cincinnati. Another 
of the top 13 Illuminati families is the Kennedy family. There is a connection 
to the Society of the Cincinnati with this family too. Jacqueline Bouvier 
Kennedy Onassis (ex-wife to both J.F.K. and Aristotie Onassis) had a grandfather 
named Major Bouvier, who invented a family genealogy which was mostly fiction 
which was self-published in 1925 as Our Forebears, but the fantasy Bouvier 
genealogy allowed him and his sons Bud and Black Jack to get into The Society of 
the Cincinnati. (see A Woman Named Jackie, by C. David Heymann, p. 18) All three 
Bouviers were very proud of their memberships and would proudly display their 
boutonnieres on their labels showing membership.</font></p>

THREE COUSINS THAT SAVED THE DUPONT COMPANY IN 1902</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The successful three Du Ponts, Alfred, Coleman, and Pierre that together took 
over the gunpowder factories ended up in some serious infighting after a few 
years. Alfred divorced his wife to marry his cousin, and the Coleman and many of 
the others did not approve of the marriage. Alfred and the others got Into some 
serious family infighting. In 1913, Alfred at one point letting his rage get the 
better of him, got the Delaware legislature to pass a special law changing his 
first wife�s sons name to spite his first wife. The special law passed the House 
in four hours secretly at Alfred�s request but failed by two votes in the Senate 
after the other Du Ponts found out what Alfred was trying. Alfred built his 
cousin-wife Alicia the most expensive house on the east coast. In 1910 dollars, 
the lowest estimate is $2 million, but the actual cost may easily have been 
several times that. The name of the mansion was named Nemours. The main grounds 
of the Nemours estate are 400 acres enclosed by an 9-ft. wall. Broken glass was 
embedded in the concrete on top of the wall. Beyond the 400 are 2,000 acres that 
make up the estate. From 1906 until 1920, the du Pont family broke up into two 
factions that waged a civil war in various arenas. Alfred I. DuPont led a 
political campaign that fought the corruption of Coleman DuPont�s forces. Up to 
that time politics and voting<span lang="en-gb">,</span> and vote counting were 
totally corrupt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">By April, 1918 Alfred had defeated Coleman for control of Delaware�s 
politics. In 1911, Alfred bought the principle daily paper in the area the 
Wilmington Morning News. In 1916, after successfully blocking his uncle Henry A. 
duPont from being re-elected, Alfred duPont bought control of 9 Delaware 
newspapers. <span lang="en-gb">&nbsp; I</span>n 1932, on a trip to Egypt Alfred found 
a dog be named Mummy that was his familiar spirit. In the biography about Alfred 
which I read it said, &quot;Alfred had scored over his sister Marguerite. Let her 
collect Virginia ghosts if she wanted them. Only he had a reincarnated Egyptian 
mascot who could produce wonders as great as those of Aladdin�s genie.&quot; (Alfred 
Du Pont by Joseph F. Wail, p. 593) Alfred L du Pont himself wrote this in a 
letter to the Rev. Baker P. Lee (23 May �32) about his familiar spirit, &quot;I have 
one or two more jobs for Mummy and then I will give her a vacation before I put 
her to work again.&quot; (He wrote at least one other letter where he talks about the 
magical powers of his dog. which was his familiar spirit. Mrs. Cazenove Lee, Jr. 
got a letter mentioning Mummy�s powers too.) Alfred died in 1935. Ed Bali and 
Jessie Ball du Pont (his widow) took over control of his estate. Ed Bail 
increased the Alfred I. duPont�s fortune and became the most powerful man in 
Florida. Ed Bali�s wealth passed the Billion dollar mark in the 50s or 60s. In 
the late 1960s, political enemies were able to attack the wealth of Ed Ball with 
new legislation and some investigation of the misuse of his money hidden in the 
foundations. In 1981, Ed Bail died. in 1985, Ed Ball�s widow claimed that Ed�s 
sister Jessie had actually murdered Alfred I. duPont in 1935. She claimed that 
while Ed was alive she had been too afraid to tell the truth about Alfred�s 
murder. Forbes magazine carried the story in Oct., 1965. T. Coleman duPont, went 
in business with President Taft�s brother Charles P. (member of the Skull &amp; 
Bones) in 1910 to build McAlpin Hotel in New York City. (Taft�s other brother 
Horace was a member of the Order of Skull and Bones. In fact, the Taft family 
which dates back to Braintree Mass. in 1679, helped start the Skull &amp; Bones 
Order and at least eight Tafts have been in the Order.) This was the first of a 
series of luxury hotels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Coleman bought New York Equitable Life Assurance Society, which was America�s 
largest insurance company. N.Y. Equitable Life Assurance company undoubtedly 
brought Coleman in touch with other Illuminati elite. He belonged to the 
Rittenhouse in Philadelphia. He was the director of a number of things including 
the Union National Bank, in Wilmington and the pres. of Central Coal &amp; Iron Co. 
along with a few other coal and Iron companies. T. Coleman has been mentioned 
already in connection to the Du Pont Gunpowder Business, which he ran for a 
number of years as head honcho. During W.W. 1, the Du Ponts made a mint. The 
company had $9 million surplus in its treasury. The result was that Du Pont 
absorbed General Motors. The DuPonts also went Into the chemical business. The 
American government had seized the German Dye Trust, and the DuPonts were given 
their patents. The Du Ponts began to build a great chemical empire on the 
synthetic, such as shatterproof glass, paints, rayon, nylon, dyes, photographic 
film, rubber, chemicals, drugs, etc. Only the Dow Chemical Company is any 
competition with the DuPont chemical operation. Alfred Victor duPont (Alfred 
I.�s son) served only as a private in the marines during W.W. I and was on board 
several ships. And yet for some reason when W.W. 11 broke out, he was made a 
consultant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1943 to 1945. He was an 
Episcopalian.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Emile Francis duPont (1898- ) graduated from Yale, like a number of duPonts 
have. He was important lay person within the Episcopal church. Pierre Samuel 
duPont belonged to the American Philosophical Society. He also wears the rosette 
of an Officer de Ia L�gion d� Honneur. (How or why he got this I haven�t found 
out.) He was on Delaware�s State Board of Education, 1919 - 21 . He was the 
President of General Motors from 1920-23 when he turned it over to Alfred P. 
Sloan, Jr. Pierre Samuel started what is called &quot;the buddy system&quot; where DuPont 
and GM�s management worked together. DuPont saved GM from extinction after W.W.I 
and has watched over GM since. Robert L duPont, Jr. is a research psychiatrist. 
He has done research at Harvard. He was the delegate for the US. at United 
Nations Commission on Narcotic drugs (1973-78). He is especially knowledgeable 
about what drugs will do to a person, which le an area of his research. And 
Francis Marguerite du Pont (born 1944 in Duluth, Minn.) is deep into research 
into genetics.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Those of us, who know what these people want to do, cringe when we see that 
some of the top genetic researchers are connected with Satanic families. Every 
American almost everyday uses a Du Pont product. When I began learning what the 
DuPont industries produce it is utterly astonishing. Anything that involves 
chemicals is under their production. Herbivores and fertilizers for farming. 
cosmetics and nylons for women, chemicals for all types of industrial 
production, textiles of all kinds, cleaning fluids such as when you clothes are 
dry cleaned. The list can go on and on. Most of us are using DuPont products 
almost continuously all through the day! General Motors, the explosives and 
gunpowder monopoly, the chemical monopoly (which its tens of thousands of 
products) gives the duPonts enormous financial leverage. The DuPonts obviously 
are in close cooperation with the elite involved with oil-because so many of 
their products are derivatives of petroleum products. In 1940, it was estimated 
the duPont family was worth $5 billion. Today, their total worth must be many 
billions of dollars, not to mention the enormous power they wield. The very 
survival of the United States military is dependent upon the military products 
of the DuPonts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Although the DuPont companies -the principle DuPont company is E.L. DuPont De 
Nemours &amp; Co (whose 1991 revenues were $38.7 billion)- are run by many 
executives who are not duPonts, the duPont family does quietly pull the strings 
in the background. Many of the executives are men whose philosophy of life 
matches the duPonts. It is very clear that the DuPont companies are being used 
in a big way to move us toward the New World Order. The first item on this, 
concerns how the Du Pont workers are being Indoctrinated. I received a video of 
the Pecos River Training near Santa Fe, N.M. that DuPont workers in the east are 
sent to. I also looked at a magazine article about this training 
(indoctrination) in the article &quot;Go Take A Flying Leap (for the company)&quot; 
(Successful Meetings June 1992, pp.59-62). </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A Christian brother who works for the DuPonts in Tennessee has been secretly 
undermining the efforts of the DuPont company leaders to turn the workers into 
New Agers. With the help of Christians in the plant, this Christian brother 
finds out what is planned, and then does his homework so that he can proof to 
the workers how New Age ideas are being brought in to subvert their thinking. 
The company changed from calling all its people &quot;employees&quot; to calling them 
initiates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The people at the plant were to all be sent to the Pecos River Training by 
DuPont, but due to the exposure of their New Age subversion, people are not 
allowing themselves to be led by the nose. This brother sent me a video of the 
Pecos River Training. and there are scenes in it where &quot;strangers&quot; are kissing 
each other-well, not exactly strangers because the training is designed to break 
down individuality and to create a group think with intimacy. Initiates are 
taught &quot;don�t slay the ego, ego is your servant.&quot; Another magazine article in 
(June 1992, p15-16) tells about the five type of thinking that the DuPont 
company is trying to instill in their people. They are 1. lateral thinking; 2. 
metaphoric thinking; 3. positive thinking (this is also called visualization-or 
in the occult witchcraft); 4. association trigger; 5. rapturing and interpreting 
dreams. An employee environmental awards program was installed where employees 
can win money by submitting their environmental suggestions. (Personal Journal 
Aug. ,92, pp 60-71.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Many of the readers of this newsletter are already aware of how the 
environmental issue is contrived and controlled by the elite. One of the items 
our new-agy Dept. of Education secretary Alexander tried to get going was for 
education to shift from the schools to the factories. This is a process that the 
Illuminati want to implement to further take us into a total slave state. 
Interestingly, DuPont has been getting into the act by spearheading Delaware�s 
BRT task force, in which students will attend seminars at Du Pont facilities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The DuPont company is employing A.A.-that is artificial intelligence. The 
neural networks are to the point they can learn from their mistakes. DuPont is 
taking us into Brave New World. They were the first ones to initiate with Fax 
NOW a rapid customer service called fax-on-demand. Du Pont is now in the process 
of becoming totally global. They already have plants in a number of South 
American countries, Mexico, Canada, US., Korea, Japan; and several European 
nations. They have been trying to figure out how to enter the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS--what used to be USSR). Apparently, they lost some money 
already in that regards. The ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries- which is allied 
with the Warburg family) in England and DuPont swapped plants. Imperial Chemical 
Industries has had their headquarters in Wilmington, Del for some time before 
this swap. DuPont got ICI nylon plant, and ICI got DuPont acrylic plant in the 
states. Why? So both companies could become more international. Or in the words 
of someone else to &quot;focus resources on businesses where each can develop 
stronger global positions.&quot; (See Economist, 10/3/,92, p.76) The swap will give 
DuPont 43% of the European market for nylon fibers used to manufacture carpets.</font></p>

has been spending according to a recent article $1.27 billion on research. Some 
of Du Pont�s research la in &quot;risky&quot; areas, that means that it is difficult to 
see how the research can financially benefit the company. This has been admitted 
by the company.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Aviation Week and Space Technology, 10/26/92 issue, p. 64,66 talks about 
the sophisticated composite materials that DuPont is producing for state of the 
art space and aviation vehicles. (I Imagine some of these composite materials 
are finding there way to the secret UFO bases, and DuPont may well be producing 
some of the parts for these secret anti-gravity machines. The article states 
that Boeing Defense and Space Group, Lockhead Aeronautical Systems Co., General 
Dynamics and DuPont and Hercules, Inc. are working together on aeronautics 
projects. Boeing and Lockhead are definitely involved with the production of 
flying saucers, so this may be a good due that DuPont is too. The article states 
that DuPont has been a leading supplier for advanced US military programs. An 
example of the sophisticated materials that the DuPonts are producing is XTC; 
the first recyclable, class-A finish thermoplastic sheet molding compound for 
horizontal exterior body panels. It is a flexible, porous; interwoven sheet of 
polyethylene berephthalate-impregnated long-glass fiber. General Motors

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Whether one is aware of the secret Satanic power of the duPonts or not, it is 
inescapable to conclude that the family is exceedingly powerful in the United 
States beyond comprehension. Every facet of our lives is influenced by products 
whose production is still ultimately under the control of the duPont family of 
control. For those people who subscribe to the theory that the world is divided 
between the Rothschild's and Rockefellers, look at the duPonts, who are truly 
independent of the other top families dispels that theory. To quote Karl 
Schriftgiesser in his book Families &quot;,...the Du Ponts of Delaware constitute a 
definite dynasty perhaps the most complete dynast ever established in this 
republic an one which seems destined to continue its kingship for generations I 
come...Today there are seven hundred members of this family...Every time a 
package of cigarettes is opened, the simple tearing of the tab is a gesture of 
tribute to the Du Ponts, and every time a great gun booms, with whatever cost to 
life or property; it echoes merrily in the feudal stronghold of this mighty 
clan...We must end with the direct statement that the Du Ponts today rule 
Delaware with an Iron hand, that their interests affect the daily lives of each 
one of us in some way, and that the Family moves on. &quot;It is, today, the great 
American dynasty. Close, unassailed, it keeps to itself, hides its scandals, 
boasts not of its good works, but continues, within American democracy, to exert 
its own indomitable way.&quot;</font></p>

that friendship I got the vibes that something was strange about Silverton, OR. 
Later, through my contacts, I found out that Anton LaVey�s church had set up 
their Oregon headquarters in Silverton. I suspect this was because Silverton had 
some occult activity already there. About 25 to 30 miles southeast of Silverton, 
OR is Mill City and Gates. The area between this is wooded and has beautiful 
falls and a large park.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Now the threads of this story return to Portland. A man who saw my book The 
Watchtower &amp; The Masons told me 2 years ago that be knew John Lawrence. He said 
I and John would like to meet, and that be would arrange it. One of the weekly 
papers here is the Willamette Weekly and they seem to be free of some of the 
stifling control of the New World Order in contrast to our daily paper The 
Oregonian. A research writer for the Willamette Weekly using John Lawrence�s 
research on the Skull &amp; Bones Order wrote a long article in the Willamette 
Weekly about the Skull &amp; Bones Order. John Lawrence and I would be a natural 
shoe-in as Mends since we both investigate secret satanic groups. But the man 
who knew John Lawrence always told me after promising to get us together that 
John had disappeared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Not only that but this man�s original openness turned to not wanting to have 
much to do with me. touching some type of very sensitive secret. Here is what I 
have been able to find out. Several satanic groups are in the Gates, OR area. 
John Lawrence was extremely interested in what the 322 of the Skull and Bones 
Society meant. He was convinced that number linked the Skull &amp; Bones society 
with other groups. John Lawrence and 2 other researchers like himself moved to 
Mill City to investigate the secret satanic groups in the area. From someone 
from the inside it turns out that the CIA shot two of those researchers while 
they were in the Mill City area investigating. The CIA went looking for John 
Lawrence. And John Lawrence is now in hiding. People in the Mill City area were 
afraid to answer my questions. However, I was able to glean a little information 
with a great deal of effort. Some occult group bought a ranch near Gates, OR. 
The head of the group is Jim Cole.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">They bought a ranch, which is not in Jim Cole�s name. The last police raid 
against any occult activity was over five years ago, and it appears that the 
Satanists are in the key positions in the Mill City and Gates. They may even 
have a person on the police force. The last obvious item to comment on is that 
for some reason, the CIA is very mixed up and sensitive about this occult 
activity. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">John Lawrence was One reaction to my duPont article was that someone whose 
mother-in-law works for the duPonts in Pennsylvania asked a few questions and 
found out that her mother-in-law is an actual witch (I don�t mean as in an old 
hag--I mean is in witchcraft.) This witch is close friends of the duPonts and 
has been protected from being fired by the duPonts. What is most significant in 
this whole thing to me is that my article got other people cognizant of what 
happening so that they could teach themselves. Once people begin to really catch 
on to things, they will begin to detect things all around that are happening in 
regards to the NWO. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most Americans don�t have any frame of reference to hang any facts about the 
conspiracy. They bemoan the idea of a Satanic conspiracy, they claim there is no 
proof all the while it is all around them! For instance, did anyone catch what 
Bill Clinton did when he faced the people and waved at the inauguration? See the 
last article in this newsletter for an answer. A friend called my attention to 
Inside Edition�s television story on Lewis Dupont Smith, the heir to the $10 
million fortune of the Du Pont Chemical Co. Lewis Dupont Smith is exposing his 
family. Of course on national television, which is controlled by the Illuminati 
they are not going to do much exposing-but they did let a few hints get through. 
Lewis Dupont Smith did get a sentence left in what was shown on TV. where he 
points the finger <span lang="en-gb">a</span>t &quot;powerful families&quot; as the 
culprits behind the drug trade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">The reason be was allowed to voice this, was that Lewis was the person behind 
the book </font> <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/drug_war.html">
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dope, Inc. </font> </a><font color="#FFFFFF">and it was 
this involvement that got him in hot trouble with his family. Lyndon LaRouche, 
who was truly exposing the Satanic conspiracy, wrote a good book Dope, Inc. The 
book exposes the Queen of England is a participant in the drug trade. Yes, the 
British royal family does tie in the elite, the occult, and the drug trade. They 
are not as nice is their pictures suggest. Lewis Dupont Smith, having a good 
feel for what is going on, recognized that Dope, Inc. is the as be put it 
(paraphrased) &quot;The only book showing the involvement of powerful families.&quot; 
Lewis provided the $212,000 for the book to be printed. (Good for him!) </font>
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Let�s just make it plain, the Satanic hierarchy is behind the drug problem. 
Lewis� family was very upset that he was helping the enemy, and they got a judge 
to rule that Lewis was incompetent to handle his financial affairs, and the 
court declared that Lewis can have only $15,000 per/<span lang="en-gb">year</span> 
of his fortune. The duPonts also tried to stop his wedding. A federal informant 
saved Lewis from getting captured, and taken 60 miles into the Atlantic on his 
father�s yacht to be tortured and programmed. His family had hired a motorcycle 
gang with black hoods and some CIA-Green Beret types to kidnap Lewis. Lewis 
managed to get wind of the scheme and save himself. He tried to get his family 
on conspiracy to kidnap, but the duPont family bear in mind as one of the top 13 
Illuminati families owns justice in this country. He failed to get his family on 
the conspiracy charge.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One detail, that I didn�t mention in the original story on the duPonts was 
the one of the more recent Governors of Delaware C. Douglas Buck was married to 
Alice H. duPont. I also left out a great deal of the inside story on the 
politicking that has gone on in Delaware this century. It is so detailed with so 
many names that I didn�t want to confuse people with it. Anyway, the bottom line 
is that behind the scenes, all of the Governors since the 1920s have been 
approved by the duPonts. I debated whether to include the du Ponts genealogy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I had it, so I decided to give it, on the chance someone might use it. The 
genealogy shows several things, a. that the duPonts like the Astors repeatedly 
used the same names over and over, but, that the duPonts like the Rothschild's had 
a lot of first cousin marriages (marriages between a du Pont and a du Pont are 
given asterisks-however some of the marriages between people with different last 
names are also between first cousins and other relation. If it looks like I�ve 
gone to a great deal of trouble for nothing-I can understand what you�re saying. 
We certainly don�t need to know every du Pont. But just like in a laboratory one 
deals with many exact small details in numerous experiments to discover a 
principle-that is what I am doing here. I am trying to break ground so that 
people will understand more about how the elite think, etc. I had hoped that I 
might also be able to track which branches are with the Illuminati and which may 
have balled out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The amazing thing about this family is that it is not a family that people 
would have thought of as being one of the top thirteen; however, for me as a 
researcher of the elite and the Satanic hierarchy, the name pops up with 
surprising frequency. For instance, Stephen M. Freeman runs the Legal Affairs 
Dept. of the Civil Rights Division of the Anti-Defamation League (which is a 
daughter of the B�nai B�rith). The ADL is a dangerous organization controlled by 
the hierarchy. The Illuminati drug money to fund this organization. Another 
Freeman is Walter Freeman who introduced the lobotomy into the U.S. with James 
W. Watts in 1936. The frontal lobotomy was a brutal method of mind control, that 
has been permitted to be done to us, under the disguise that it is of benefit to 
humanity. Then there was Simon Freeman an important intelligence officer. And 
the list goes on of people that are in key places with the Freeman name. But the 
most important position of all which removes all doubt that the family is at the 
top is that the late Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion was Gaylord Freeman.</font></p>

discoverers of The PRIEURE DE SION</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">What is the Prieure de Sion? Are we sure it exists? How does this relate to 
the hierarchy? The Prieure de Sion (Priory of Zion) was unknown to the general 
public until 1982 when a book co-authored by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and 
Henry Lincoln came out. The book was entitled </font>
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b>
<a name="Holy_Blood,_Holy_Grail">Holy Blood, Holy Grail</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> and it offered 
historical proof that an organization called the Prieure de Sion was powerful 
and had existed since the time of the early crusades (1099 A.D.). In 1991, I 
came out a little more information on the Prieure de Sion. The organization is 
so little known to even my readership, that we need to stop and really examine 
the Prieure de Slon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In trying to figure out the mysteries surrounding this organization, Lincoln, 
Leigh and Baigent�s research led them to conclude that the holy bloodline that 
the Prieure de Sion guarded was the bloodline of Jesus. This immediately made 
all their research anathema (condemned and disliked) by the most of Christendom. 
I watched to see if Christians would refute the unbiblical parts of their 
research, but besides a couple of short articles (Christian Century, 9/1-8/82, - 
&quot;Raiders of the Lost Grail&quot; and Christianity Today, 9/3/82 - &quot;Holy Blood, Holy 
Grail - holy mackerel&quot;) in Christian periodicals (in addition to this was a 
small book in England- The Holy Grail Revealed) which simplistically claimed 
that the book was of no value because obviously it was erroneous, no one even 
pretended to try to refute the book (as far as I know except for that English 
book which did pretend but didn�t refute anything.) The authors went on to write 
two more popular historical exposes concerning the Prieure de Sion and 
Freemasonry (The Messianic Legacy and The Temple and The Lodge).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Actually to be fair to the Christians, if I hadn�t already known from my 
research that much of the European information in Holy Blood<span lang="en-gb">,</span> 
Holy Grail was correct, the wild religious speculation about Jesus in Part 3 may 
have caused me to doubt the book too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The first Christian author to pick up on the Prieure de Sion was J.R. Church 
who wrote Guardians of the Grail which built on Holy Blood. Holy Grail�s 
research in a constructive way and put more pieces of the puzzle together. At 
last a book was out that challenged some of the false ideas of Holy Blood, Holy 
Grail without blindly throwing their excellent research. While the public at 
large had never heard of the Prieure de Sion until Holy Blood. Holy Grail came 
out, the organization was written about in high level military intelligence 
briefings years before the book. Some of the men in high level intelligence have 
become concerned with the direction this nation is going. It is through such men 
that independent confirmation had leaked out even before the book. The 
information did get to some researchers. I came out with my Be Wise As Serpents 
book in 1991, which among other things covered the Prieure de Sion, after I had 
concluded that the evidence verified its existence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I approached the issue from my own angle of research. In researching the 
Illuminati it became clear 1. that bloodlines were very important, 2. that the 
people in high level Satanism believe they are descendents of the House of 
David, 3. the Illuminati�s activities tied in in many ways to the Prieure de 
Sion. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One startling tie in was that the Freeman family was, according to an 
informant, one of the top 13 Illuminati families. The ex-Illuminati people I 
received information from were not familiar with Holy Blood, Holy Grail nor 
Guardians of the Grail. Even if they had, which they definitely hadn�t, neither 
book mentions the Freeman family. It wasn�t until the researchers of Holy Blood, 
Holy Grail wrote their sequel The Messianic Legacy that was published in 1987 
that the name Freeman came out as the leader of the Prieure de Sion. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In short the way the research of mine and others simultaneously from 
different angles came up independently with similar conclusions using totally 
different sources confirms beyond a doubt that the Prieure de Sion exists, and 
that the Freeman family is indeed a very powerful family. I have never spelled 
out in detail nil the proofs about the Prieure de Sion and the Freeman family, 
and even now I am not going to. To me the basics are facts, and I don�t want to 
get bogged down trying to prove the obvious, when there is so much more to 
learn. There are stubborn people whose minds will not come along no matter how 
much proof and encouragement. They will just have to stay where they are.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="DESCRIBING_THE_PRIEURE_DE_SION_">DESCRIBING THE PRIEURE DE SION</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The original start of the Prieure de Sion appears to have been the idea of a 
number of powerful bloodlines, and included various descendents of the 
Merovingians, including the House of Lorraine, the House of Guise, the Medicis, 
Sforzas, the Estes, the Gonzagas, and the St. Clairs (Sinclairs). The Medicis 
are tied to the Black Nobility also. From the beginning the Prieure de Sion has 
been committed to Hermetic Magic (a type of black magic that originated with the 
ancient Egyptians and portrayed in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.) Ren� d� 
Anjou, a descendent of the Merovingians persuaded Cosimo de Medici to establish 
in c. 1444 a non-church library at San Marco where Plato, Pythagorean works, and 
books on Hermetic Magic were translated. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Up until this time, the Catholic church had control of all the libraries. It 
was from Cosimo d� Medici�s library that the spark of Greek and Egyptian 
teachings set off what developed into the Renaissance, which was revival of 
humanism and the occult. It appears that during the Middle Ages, witchcraft and 
the mystery religions had seriously dissolved to the point that these modes of 
thought had to be relearned from the ancient writings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Interestingly, the Middle Ages when witchcraft and paganism were dissolving 
have been branded the <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>Dark Ages<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span> 
by the establishment, and inaccurately painted as a time when learning went out.<span lang="en-gb">
</span>&nbsp;A magazine put out during W.W. II by Prieure de Sion members was 
Vaincre. The organization that took credit for the magazine was Alpha Galates. 
It carried articles on Atlantis, theosophy, Celtic wisdom, and other esoteric 
things. The magazine also declared itself in favour of a United Europe. Robert 
Schuman who was associated with the magazine Vaincre, later become a leading 
architect of the EEC. An internal magazine for Prieure de Sion members is 
CIRCUIT (the acronym for Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of the 
Independent and Traditionalist Union. A 1956 issue of CIRCUIT promotes the use 
of a 13-sign zodiac rather than the traditional 12. The 1959 series of CIRCUIT 
refer the reader to<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Vaincre. The CIRCUIT magazine 
which claims to write its articles with �hidden meaning,, says this cryptically 
about the Prieure de Sion, &quot;We are not strategists and we stand above all 
religious denominations, political perspectives and financial matters. We give 
to those who come to us moral aid and the indispensable manna of the spirit.&quot; 
Another article says, &quot;...except through new methods and new men, for politics 
are dead.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>The curious fact remains that men do not 
wish to recognize this. There exists only one question: economic organization.&quot;
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Dr. Otto von Hapsburg, a descendent of the Merovingian's, and a Knights of 
Malta, headed Pan-Europa, an organization that has been working toward a U.S. of 
Europe. Their logo was a Celtic cross in a circle. The first point in time that 
the Prieure de Sion can be pinpointed is when Jerusalem was captured by the 
Crusaders and an abbey of monks that Peter the Hermit had belonged to was 
established in a building called the Abbey of Notre Dame de Mont de Sion just 
outside of Jerusalem. This abbey had an order that was called the Ordre de Sion.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Over the centuries the Ordre de Sion has developed into what we have today as 
the Prieure de Sion (Priory of Zion in English. Bear in mind that the Ordre of 
Sion was visible for several centuries but has been totally secret after the 
13th century. It became semi-visible during the 1960s and 70s and became secret 
again in 1984. The group of monks that made up the original order were led by 
Ursus of the Merovingians. They were given a place at Orval in France until they 
apparently decided to move to the Holy Land. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">This order appears to have had the power behind the scenes to have been in 
the position to select who would sit on the throne at Jerusalem, and the 
initially selected their man Godfroi de Bouillon. The Ordre de Sion (Prieure de 
Sion) set up a military order called the </font> <b>
<a name="Knights_Templar" href="http://www.whale.to/b/templar.html">
<font color="#FFFFFF">Knights 
Templar</font></a></b><font color="#FFFFFF">. Louis VII of France became indebted to the Knights Templar, and 
in repayment of the help he had received he established some of the Ordre de 
Sion at the priory of St. Samson, along with establishing 26 men (2 groups of 
13) at a small priory at the Mount of Sion, Orleans, France. In 1188, the Ordre 
de Sion let the Knights Templars apparently go their own way, which eventually 
was to trouble. The story of the Knights Templars is exceedingly interesting 
because it relates to the Satanic International Bankers of today. The Knights 
Templars became the first European wide International Bankers.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">How their story fits into everything would take to long to tell at this 
point. At that time period when the Knights Templars took off on their own, the 
Ordre de Sion became the Prieure de Sion, and also used the names Ormus and 
Rose-Croix, The Prieure de Sion is intimately connected to the creation and 
guidance of the Rosicrucian's and Freemasons. In the Be Wise As Serpents book, 
chapter 12 it talks about how the Prieure de Sion set up the Scottish Rite of 
Freemasonry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1613, the House of Lorraine (part of the Prieure de Sion) joined with the 
House of Stuart. After that the Prieure de Sion began to display more interest 
in Scotland. Scotland was one of the few countries where the Knights Templars 
had thrived when the order was suppressed by the order of the Pope. Scotland 
also had several occult traditions operating. It was a hotbed of occult 
activity. Scotland and the Scottish people have played a very big role in the 
New World Order conspiracy for centuries. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile, when the Prieure de Sion went underground they established their 
archives in some secret rooms beneath the chapel of St. Catherine, at the castle 
at Gisors, northern France in the rue de Vienne. The archives were, according to 
reports, contained in 30 coffers. Secret tunnels connect the chapel with the 
local cemetery. The Merovingian descendents and the Prieure de Sion have guarded 
the sacred blood line that Satan has built up. Their members are secretly 
scattered in key positions throughout society. Many of the descendents are 
unaware of their heritage. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">For instance, within the Sinclair family only certain branches have kept up 
their generational occult heritage, and are aware of what is going on. Family 
trees subdivide over the centuries until the Merovingian family tree has become 
a forest. The Houses of Hapsburg-Lorraine (whose titles are dukes of Lorraine 
and Kings of Jerusalem), Plantard, Luxembourg, Montpezat, Montesquiou, among 
many others including the Freeman family, and hundreds of others. Be Wise As 
Serpents revealed for the first time (as far as I know) how all the heads 
(presidents) of the LDS and RLDS have been descendents of the Merovingian 
dynasty, and they and the Masons have both used the Merovingian symbol, the bee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="THE_HOUSE_OF_DAVID_">THE HOUSE OF DAVID</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In my research of high level Satanists, it became clear the the bloodline 
that was key in their minds was the House of David--not Jesus Christ�s lineage. 
I discovered that the House of David had set up a Kingdom in southern France. I 
discovered this while rummaging through history books on the Middle Ages. I came 
upon a book A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France 768-900. This book was the key 
for me to realize that the Merovingian dynasty which wove its bloodline into the 
royal bloods of Europe was Jewish in origin. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When I read Holy Blood Holy Grail, it became apparent that the authors theory 
of Jesus� bloodline had clouded their realization that the key was that the 
Prieure de Sion was of the House of David and was in this sense Jewish (although 
most of the Prieure de Sion are most likely not attending synagogues). Indeed 
the Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair told them 
so much. To quote the pertinent paragraph from The Messianic Legacy, p. 296, &quot;At 
our meeting in April, 1982, M. Plantard adopted an ambivalent attitude towards 
our book [Holy Blood, Holy Grail]. On the whole, be endorsed it and offered to 
correct, for the French edition, certain vague or unclear references. At the 
same time, he would neither confirm nor deny our thesis that the Merovingian 
bloodline was descended from Jesus. There was no evidence either way, he said 
non-committal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It was �all too far in the past�, all �too long ago�. There were no reliable 
genealogies. Besides, Jesus had brothers. Nevertheless, he acknowledged the 
Merovingians to have been of Judaic descent, deriving from the royal line of 
David.&quot; The significance of this is tremendous. It means that those people who 
have been saying that it is a Jewish conspiracy have been correct--even if some 
of these people saying these things may not be greatest characters. This also 
opens the door as to why the top leaders of the Illuminati have been willing to 
work with the Askenazi Jews. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In Be Wise As Serpents, I show from Masonic sources that there is indeed a 
big connection at the top with the Jewish leadership and the House of David and 
Freemasonry. The goals of Freemasonry are intertwined with the goals of the 
Prieure de Sion. There is a big danger in labeling the conspiracy &quot;Jewish&quot;. When 
people label &quot;Jewish&quot; as &quot;bad&quot; it confuses more than clarifies. The Jewish 
people are not the enemy. Next, although many of the Satanic hierarchy claim to 
be from the House of David, they do not publicly proclaim themselves as Jews, in 
fact they may publicly take a negative posture toward the Jews, such as Lady 
Astor and some of the duPonts have been.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It is perhaps fine that Zionism be labelled evil. Zionism includes both 
Christians and Jews. To be a Zionist is to identify oneself with a movement that 
the elite has set up and controlled for their purposes. Many in the Zionist 
movement are like common people everywhere, they want do to what is right, they 
have simply not gotten the bigger picture, and are being used. When two groups 
have some similarities but each want to keep their own identity they can be 
mortal rivals. One group that has been very easy for Satan to provoke against 
Christians is the Jews. Perhaps no group of people has hated Christians with 
more intensity. One of the first groups that Satan worked at controlling were 
the Jews. But to call the conspiracy Jewish is misleading. The father of it all 
is Satan. It is Satanic, and it will use anyone it can. And God will use anyone 
too. How many of us have escaped helping one cause or another of the 
establishment or in being in some organization that the establishment was using? 
Let each of us examine ourselves and get our own lives in order. There is a song 
about violin that was going to auctioned off cheap until a master violinist 
picked it up and played a good tune on it. Don�t auction people off cheaply, the 
touch of the Master�s hand can turn anyone into a beautiful thing. Don�t reject 
anyone who will let the Master�s hand tune his life. This is a war against evil, 
not race. Not everyone of the most evil bloodlines is on the enemies� side. Many 
are trying to serve the Lord. Likewise, just because the Freeman family is one 
of the top 13 Satanic families doesn�t mean that all or even most Freemans are 
part of the hierarchy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">From 1918 to 1963, Jean Cocteau was Grand Master of the Prieure de Sion. 
Following the unification of the various powers into a secret NWO government in 
1954, the Prieure de Sion had a major policy dispute.<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp; I</span>n 
1963 with Cocteau�s death, Gaylord Freeman, helped by Antonio Merzagora and 
Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair, governed the Prieure de Sion. In 1981, Pierre 
Plantard took over as Grand Master. In 1952, long before becoming Grand Master, 
Plantard de Saint-Clair transferred 100 million francs worth of gold ingots to 
Switzerland to the Union des Banques Suisses. When this was publicly revealed, 
he said that it was a legitimate move made for the French government. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1955, several men associated with the Prieure de Sion obtained some old 
parchments two of which gave the Merovingian genealogies, and they used the 
British Notary of Royal Appointment Patrick Francis Jourdan Freeman (that�s one 
name) in relation to a request to the French government to take the old 
documents to London, England where they were kept at 39 Great Russell St.
<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Later P.F.J. Freeman was used again the next year to request that the 
documents be allowed to stay in England to be held in a safe deposit box at 
Lloyd�s Bank of Europe in London. One of the men involved went by the name 
Captain Ronald Stansmore Nutting of London (born in Dublin, IR) who is reported 
by reliable sources to have been in British Intelligence MI5, and had sat on the 
board of directors of at least 14 companies, including Arthur Guinness and 
Guardian Assurance. He was chairman of the board of the British and Irish Steam 
Packet Company. He was also governor of the Bank of Ireland. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of Guardian Assurance�s departmental chairmen was also an MI<span lang="en-gb">5</span> 
operative besides Capt. Nutting. Another P.d.S. member who was with Nutting was 
Viscount Frederick Leathers, who was British Minister of War Transport during 
W.W. II. Viscount Leathers had a business associate and long-time friend Sir 
William<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Stephenson, who was the wartime chief for 
MI6�s American branch office called BSC (British Security Coordination) in New 
York. Another friend of Leathers was Connop Guthrie also headed BSC for MI-6 in 
New York. Guthrie was a shipping executive. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Due to internal trouble in the Prieure de SIon that resulted from a rule that 
members had to place a birth certificate and signature with the Priory, an 
English faction created forgeries of birth certificates and signatures and in 
secret protest sent these as originals to France. PJ. Freeman then got involved 
in this act of defiance. Another division occurred between the French members 
and the Brit.-American members. The French wanted more of a role and some type 
of restoration of the monarchy in a United Europe. The Amer.-British members who 
far outnumbered the few French wanted to skip the monarchy idea. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Vatican and the Prieure de Sion (P.d.S. - my personal abbreviation) work 
together. Apparently, the Vatican is given some type of minor kickback for their 
cooperation. John Drick, A. Robert Abboud, and Gaylord Freeman were three 
members of the Prieure de Sion that were associated with the First National Bank 
of Chicago. John Drick had started as an assistant cashier in 1944 and became a 
vice-president three years later. In 1969 Drick became both the president and 
one of the directors of the bank. He also was on the board of a number of other 
companies including, Stephan Chemical, MCA incorporated, Oak Industries, and 
Central Illinois Public Service. The Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance (the 
Guardian Assurance) in London where P.J. Freeman worked had shared a building 
with the First National Bank of Chicago which had Gaylord Freeman as chairman of 
the board of directors. In other words, the two businesses and the two Freemans 
all connected its seems to the Prieure de Sion, and then by other inferences all 
connected back to the hierarchy. Gaylord Freeman�s signature appeared on a 
Prieure de Sion document of Dec. 16, 1983. Gaylord Freeman never publicly 
admitted that he even knew anything about the P.d.S.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">On the next page is a photocopy of the article that the New York Times ran 
when Gaylord (Gale) Freeman died. It has often been said if you want to know who 
really runs things, look at a man�s advisors. Now check this out, Gaylord 
Freeman never ran for any major political office--and the voting process is 
supposedly to get men who know what they are doing into office, and yet if you 
read the N.Y. Times biography you will read &quot;Mr. Freeman...was frequently called 
on by Washington for advice and assistance.� Yes, Presidents and Congressman 
called Gaylord Freeman for advice (instructions might be a better term), and yet 
most of us haven�t even heard of the man! Again for those who think that only 
the Rockefellers and Rothschild's are powerful families, let me ask, why weren�t 
they calling Rockefeller? Not only did the Presidents turn to Gaylord Freeman 
for advice (orders), they also turned to another member of the family, Roger A. 
Freeman. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Roger A. Freeman was a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute. (I suspect 
Roger was Jewish but the newspaper doesn�t say any religion.) The New York Times 
biographical news article that came out when Roger died is also put on the next 
page. Note that in the headline they emphasize that Roger Freeman played the 
role as advisor to 2 presidents. And yet I doubt that hardly any American has 
heard of him. One prominent Freeman, James D. Freeman has played a leadership 
role in Unity School. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">James Freeman has written at least six important books for Unity which they 
have published.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Two of his works are Unity School and 
The Story of Unity. Had the article on spiritual warfare covered ritual sites in 
Kansas-Missouri I would have mentioned about the Unity School. Near (adjoining) 
the Unity School, in between Kansas City, Ks. and Kansas City, Mo. is a strip of 
wooded land. Little Ricky Rd. goes through this area, and the forest along 
Little Ricky Rd. has been used for Satanic rituals by a coven that was made up 
of adults not teenagers-Interestingly, a man who was part of the Unity School 
hierarchy, and came to Christ told me that the school secretly conducted 
Luciferian initiations and that Robert Schuler, 33� Mason, and leading 
Protestant clergyman knew all about Luciferian initiations being conducted 
there, yet Schuler went ahead and taught his principles of church growth to

would be Unity School of Witchcraft. Many witches have in fact been associated 
with the Unity Church and are closely working with it to secretly destroy 
Christianity. I know from inside information that the hierarchy is sending 
orders to the school, so it would not surprise me if James D. Freeman was 
actually part of the Freeman family that is one of the top 13 Illuminati 
families. Some of the family are clearly Jewish, such as Ernest Robert Freeman, 
who lives in Maryland and is an important Jewish leader. He has been the dlr. of 
the Jewish Community Council in his area, and President of the Sachs/Freeman 
Assoc. The Sachs family also ties into the conspiracy so that is interesting. 
And Grace Freeman, who is Jewish, wrote Inside the Synagogue. Some of the 
Freemans are leaders in Christendom too. </font> </p>

Theological Seminary, which is a totally ungodly place--they turn out socialists 
for graduates, etc. Lee Jackson Freeman was a member of the executive board of 
the national ministries of the American Baptist Church. He also served in the 
Ecumenical Ministries in his Scranton, PA area. R. Lexie Freeman is a Nashville,

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There are obviously different unrelated family lines that have the last name 
Freeman. In the preliminary genealogical work that I have done I have found 
Freemans coming from England, France, Germany and Austria. Howard L. Freeman is 
a Christian author, who has written about how the economic system of our nation 
is ungodly. I wrote him a letter of inquiry about the Freeman family. He wrote 
me and told me that his family came from the English town of Barnstaple. And 
that the Freemans in that area treated him as a royal guest when he visited the 
area. He was shown around England over a 50 mile radius by the Freemans in 
England. His opinion was that his last name did not originate in Barnstaple, 
England. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The history books record an M.P. (Member of Parliament) back in the times 
when our revolution was being plotted who was named Sambrooke Freeman (c. 
1721-82). He was from Fawley Court, near Henley, in Berkshire. He went to 
Oxford. I do not know if the Freemans in Moriah (the Illuminati) are from 
England originally, but from the little clues I have that would be my first 
guess. If not England, then likely France. Mary Freeman of Marlborough, 
Wiltshire, England claimed back in 1988 that on 7/13/88, almost at midnight, 
that she, Mary Freeman, was leaving the ancient Druid stone circle at Avebury 
when she saw a UFO over Silbury Hill. Most people are interested In her UFO 
report--I�m curious why this Freeman lady was out late at night at some ancient 
Druid site.</font></p>

was Minnesota�s Gov. Orville Freeman who appointed Walter Mondale to the 
position of Attorney General when Walter was just 32 years old. <b>

Skull &amp; Bones in 1869. See his picture which is reproduced. Don Freeman wrote 
books on witches, including Space Witch, and Tilly Witch. Another Freeman was 
instrumental in the O.T.O. being set up. For those who know about the O.T.O. 
(I�ve mentioned it in the past) it is hermetic magic and Satanism. Right here in 
Oregon, we have been watching some Freemans, because it appears that there are 
some Satanic coven members here in Oregon who are Freemans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Freemans in the Satanic hierarchy in the U.S. work with the Illuminati 
families of the Collins and Wheeler families. Readers are already familiar with 
the Collins family, but not the Wheelers. Now let me explain who the Wheelers 
are, because I am trying to put some pieces of the puzzle in place for you. Gen. 
Earl Wheeler and his brother Leo Wheeler, a Grande Master of the Illuminati (see 
the top diagram pg. 14 1/1/93 newsletter), are secret Satanists and also 33� 
Freemasons. Leo Wheeler, by virtue of his Grande Master status in the satanic 
hierarchy has been able to visit the Dulce, N.M. underground facility. The route 
he used was to fly in, and then the last stretch is done in a black limousine. 
Various people in the Dulce area have occasionally spotted these VIP black 
limousines. The Wheeler family has a long history of involvement with Satanism, 
and its genealogical history goes back to the House of David. An amazing clue 
(or an amazing coincidence) appears when we look at the genealogy of the Mormon 
leaders. (The Be Wise As Serpents book makes the connections of the Mormon 
leadership but it doesn�t appear that many have read or understood the 
significance. Maybe this here will help.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">The top <b><a name="Mormon_leadership">Mormon leadership</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> (LDS &amp; RLDS) 
all are related and descendants of the Merovingians, but for sake of discussion 
let us take Brigham Young. Brigham Young�s first name was Brigham. It was given 
to him because of the importance of the Brigham family. His grandmother was 
Sibil Brigham. Sibyls were prophetesses of the ancient world, and the name is a 
semi-common occult name. Brigham Young and his family practiced magic. They were 
also intimately aware of their genealogy, which goes back to the Merovingian 
Dynasty! </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One wonders if it is coincidence that the Merovingians� primary symbol--the 
bee is also the symbol for the Mormon church and Utah. Look at a Deseret 
Industries (Mormon thrift stores) building in your area and you will see the bee 
on their side. But not only does Brigham Young have Merovingian blood from at 
least two lines of blood (and possibly as many as 6 lines of blood back), but he 
also is related to the Collins family of Massachusetts that we wrote about in 
the 2/1/93 newsletter. Further, Brigham Young is also a blood relative of the 
Wheelers. This is the clue which is amazing. A. chart of all this is given on 
the next page. If Young�s Wheeler relatives are related to the Satanic 
Illuminati Wheelers, then we have an example of how 3 strains of top Satanic 
blood have interwoven and resulted in the birth of the Freemason, Witch, and 
President of the LDS Brigham Young. Perhaps the tie-in doesn�t exist, but it 
certainly is worthy of our examination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There may be some disinformation put out on this by the other side after this 
comes out--so don�t be taken in by their establishment. As I have mentioned 
before, a descendent of Joseph Smith, Jr. who was Satanic Ritually Abuse victim, 
has quietly told certain people that her family is indeed a Satanic bloodline. 
Further, I have mentioned other confidential pieces of information about how the 
leaders of the Salt Lake City Mormon church (LDS) are working with the various 
parts of the Illuminati�s empire, incl. the Jehovah�s Witnesses. Although the 
public split occurred between Mormonism and Masonry before the Mormons went to 
Utah, that was only for public consumption. The leadership have coordinated 
activities. The Mormon religion is really a high rite of Freemasonry, and this 
explains why when the Mormons went to Utah, the Mormons held Masonic schools. 
(Hosea Stout mentions these Mormon Masonic schools in On The Mormon Frontier; 
The Diary of Hosea Stout, ed. by Juanita Brooks, 2 vols., Salt Lake City: Univ. 
of Utah Press, 1964, 2: 415, 423.) After going to Utah, Brigham Young contacted 
the chiefs of Freemasonry in England and proposed that Mormonism be granted a 
public charter to become its own Masonic Rite. The hierarchy told him no. After 
that Brigham Young began to publicly distance Mormonism from Masonry, and the 
Masons strangely broke many of their own rules to distance themselves publicly 
from Mormonism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">LDS apostle Reed Smoot was given permission to run for office by the LDS 
church. Pres. Harding appointed him to the World War Foreign Debt Commission, 
and he also served the elite as the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
The War Finance Corp. just happened due to Smoots arranging it to gave the LDS 
church a $10 million loan. Marriner S. Eccles, of an old elite family, and a 
Mormon (and an Illuminatus) became Sec. of the Treasury in 1934, and was 
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from �34-51. Ezra Taft Bensen, later the 
LDS President, was appointed Sec. of Agriculture. David B. Haight, a prominent 
Mormon was made the head of all the Mayors in the San Francisco area--the full 
title is &quot;governor of the San Francisco Bay Area Council of Mayors.&quot; Mormon 
Charles C. Cox was put in charge of the Securities and Exchange as commissioner, 
I could go on listing some other Mormons who have been placed in key 
establishment positions. Why? Why are the Illuminati and their establishment not 
afraid of these Mormons who have leadership positions in the LDS church? This is 
a whole area I would love to explain but as this article is digressing from the 
Freemans, I need to return to subject being considered. The Lords of Anjou (part 
of the P.d.S.) were Plantagents and so was one of Brigham Young�s ancestors. if 
we go back through the Goddard and Gifford family ancestors. I am trying to get 
my readers to look behind the curtain of organizations that we publicly, and to 
see what is going on back stage. And then I am trying to show how the people 
back stage are related and know it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1991. Pulitzer prize winner James B. Stewart, the front page editor of the 
Wall Street Journal, came out with his book Den of Thieves. The book is the 
detailed story of how major insiders on Wall Street were systematic crooks. The 
four biggest names of the insider-trading ring were Michael Milken, Ivan Boesky, 
Martin Siegel, and Dennis Levine. Robert Freeman worked with the ring, and ended 
up pleading guilty after the evidence cornered him. I am always suspicious of 
exposes of the establishment done by the establishment's system. Often, the big 
crooks get away and the middle management take the blame. Take for instance, 
Iran-Contra. But Stewart�s book Den of Thieves may be helpful in our 
understanding the Freeman family better. The Freeman family is one of the top 13 
Illuminati families.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At this time, there is nothing to tie Robert Freeman to Satanism, and that is 
not the purpose here. In an investigation, all the possible clues are collected. 
I am bringing my readership into this investigation of the top 13 families, and 
here is a possible suspect to make note of. Robert Freeman worked for the Jewish 
investment firm of Goldman, Sachs. Goldman, Sach�s headquarters i<span lang="en-gb">s</span> 
on Broad St. In NY, NY. Just a short distance from Goldman, Sach�s trading floor 
in their headquarters building on the glass-enclosed 29th floor was Robert 
Freeman�s office. Robert Freeman was a graduate of Dartmouth. He liked to 
vacation in Colorado skiing with his family. He worked with Siegel and Boesky 
especially in his illegal insider deals. These insiders made millions off 
investors and would have made billions if they hadn�t been arrested. Freeman and 
Siegel made some complicated deals such as the Unocal and the Storer affairs. 
Boesky went to Russia after prison and offered his financial talents but was 
politely rebuffed. One of the men involved with the ring was Milken. Milken�s 
influence had been a major factor behind the stock market recovery after Black 
Monday, 1987. That was Monday, Oct. 19, and the stock market plunged over 500 
pts. that day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Milken convinced investors to invest in the stock market, and the Federal 
Reserve flooded the market with cash too to prevent a disaster. M<span lang="en-gb">i</span>lken 
was (&amp; maybe still is) a close friend of Mason Jessie Jackson. Milken is 
heralded by many prominent Jews even after his arrest as a great Jew. That�s not 
my opinion, a newspaper article will back that up. The Drexel firm associated 
with Milken was advised by the Federal Reserve, the SEC, the Treasury, and the 
Stock Exchange to declare bankruptcy with Chapter 11, which they did. Goldman 
and Sachs, both Jews, went to bat for Freeman, and hired private detectives to 
help his case. Kaye, Scholar in NY represented Freeman legally. Eventually 
Robert Freeman pleaded guilty and was given a four-month sentence which he 
served and was released on Aug. 30, 1990. The significant part is that Robert 
Freeman was someone who was one of the major players in the New York Stock 
Exchange. Robert Freeman is not to be confused with Ernest Robert Freeman who 
also is connected to the Sachs family, and was mentioned In the original article 
on the Freeman family (Mar. 15, 1993).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Again the ties between various Illuminati families is very involved, and a 
long unravelling process, similar to untying a set of bad knots confronts the 
researcher. The Kennedy family abounds with marriages to names such as 
Anketells, Baileys, Booths, Buckley's, Collins, Hatfield's, Humphrey's, 
Freeman's, James, Phelps, Reagan's, Russell's, and Smiths.</font><sup><a href="#3."><font color="#FFFFFF">3</font></a></sup><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
The Kennedy's that we will look closest at are related to the Fitzpatrick's, a 
powerful Irish family whose coat of arms has 3 fleur-de-lis with a dragon and a 
lion. (The Fitzpatrick's may tie back to France, and they may possibly part of 
the Sang Royal (Sangraal--Sang Raal is the term used in the older manuscripts 
which can mean both Royal bloodline or Holy Grail.) Jackie Bouvier Kennedy 
Onassis who married John F. Kennedy was tied to the Auchinclosses via her 
sister�s marriage into the Auchincloss family. The Auchinclosses are Scottish 
bloodline of the Illuminati.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;One can fairly hear the woof and tweet of history whistle through the names 
of the ramified Auchincloss tribe: Bunt, Grosvenor, Rockefeller, Saltonstall, 
Tiffany, Vanderbilt and Winthrop among others.&quot;</font><sup><a href="#5."><font color="#FFFFFF">5</font></a></sup><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
For instance, Hugh D. Auchincloss, Sr. married Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter 
of Oliver B. Jennings, who co-founded Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller. As 
for the numerous Kennedy intermarriages with notable names, for instance, Bernet 
Shafer Kennedy (1798-1878) married Phebe Freeman in 1820.</font><sup><a href="#6."><font color="#FFFFFF">6</font></a></sup><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
But then the question arises--were either of these people secretly part of the 
occult? Andrew Kennedy married Margaret (Penny) Hatfield (1824-1989). The Andrew 
Kennedy family is allied with the Hatfield, Bailey, Collins, and Mullins 
families.</font><sup><a href="#8"><font color="#FFFFFF">8 </font> </a></sup>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There are several versions of how the Kennedy's got started, but when one 
goes in and examines things, what turns out is that the origins of the Kennedy's 
is Ireland are very clear. They are descendants of Brian Born (also known as 
Brian Caeneddi) and his nephew who spelled it Cinneide. The name thereafter was 
O�Kennedy. They originally were a Dalcassion sept, and were in the area near 
Killahoe, and Killokennedy parish is a reminder of that ancient fact. The 
O�Briens and MacNamaras forced them into new territories where they became the 
Lords of Ormond--what is now north Tipperary. Most Kennedy's in Ireland today 
are still found in that area. The Kennedy's remained powerful into the 16th 
century.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">The Kennedy family divided up into 3 branches:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Around 1600 a Scottish branch of the Kennedy's appeared. There are several 
stories as to how they got their name Kennedy, and it is possible that they were 
not from Ireland. However, interestingly, genealogists have ascertained that 
whether the various branches of the aristocratic Kennedy's in Scotland and 
Ireland may have different origins (because the origins of the Scottish branch 
is unclear)--it can be shown that they all subsequently intermarried and became 
related if they were not related to begin with. Gayle Marie Kennedy points this 
out on page 3 of her book My Kennedy Ancestors..., �It is believed that all the 
foregoing Kennedy families are related either by virtue of being descendants of 
common ancestors, or by intermarriage.&quot; I looked up in Burke�s General Armory to

Marquess of Ailsa (1872-1943). Because he is often called the Marquess of Ailsa 
you might not know him by his name Archibald Kennedy, who was the 15th Earl of 
Cassillis. This branch of the Kennedy's married into Scottish royalty. For 
instance, Sir James Kennedy married Mary, a daughter of King Robert III, and 
their son was Sir Gilbert Kennedy was made Lord Kennedy before 1458. Archibald 
Kennedy was an extremely powerful Freemason and held numerous key positions in 
the Grand Lodge of Scotland. He was 1st Grand Principle from 1913 to his death 
in 1943. At his death his titles passed to his brother Charles. Archibald 
Kennedy was initiated in Holywood House Lodge No. 44, Edinburgh, Nov. 17, 1896.

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">So the question always arises as I examine the elite of the Illuminati and 
the New World Order--how is this Kennedy related to this other Kennedy. For 
instance, how is David M. Kennedy (who is a Bilderberger) and William Jesse 
Kennedy III (who is a key man for the Duke Illuminati family--he is pres. of 
Mutual life Insur. Co, a Duke financial asset, dir. of RCA, trustee of the Ford 
Theater where the elite killed Lincoln, and associated with the Pilgrim Soc.

I can safely say that if one goes back several hundred years the Kennedy

<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">One of my first clues that the Kennedy's had something to do with the 
Illuminati was the conspiracy book The Widow�s Son-- The Historical Illuminatus 
Chronicles (Vol. 2) by Robert Anton Wilson. Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea, 
authors of &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; are not Christians. On the contrary, they are regular 
participants in the central Ohio Starwood Festival for witches and pagans.
</font>
<a href="http://www.whale.to/b/wilson.html">Robert Anton Wilson</a><font color="#FFFFFF"> has publicly 
on a number of occasions explained that he is a Gnostic and a great fan of 
Aleister Crowley. I picked up Wilson�s book The Widow�s Son in a Satanic/New Age 
bookstore. In both volume 2 (the teaser chapter at the end) and in volume 3 of 
The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles one is taught the significance of </font>
<font color="#FF0000"> Brian Caeneddi</font><font color="#FFFFFF">, the first Kennedy, and how Brian Caeneddi�s blood got into some very 
important royal bloodlines. </font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">It is interesting that an informed man like Wilson, who spends time doing 
rituals with Gnostics and Witches, would declare that the Kennedy family is an 
important bloodline in connection with the Illuminati. How many people knew that 
Tip O�Neil, speaker of the house of representatives, was a descendent of the 
Kennedy clan? Wilson writes for New Agers and witches, not for Christians. One 
gets the feel that his experience with the occult has somehow given him a very 
good idea of what is going on in terms of the Masons, the Illuminati, etc. He 
writes his books in such a way that they are historical novels with a great deal 
of facts, and yet one is always left wondering by the style of writing whether 
the author wants to be taken serious or not, is what he writes make-believe or 
history padded with some fiction? I personally believe it is just the way the 
occult works, they expose the facts for their own people, but in a way that will 
not be taken seriously by others. Wilson acts like a buffoon one minute and a 
serious conspiracy researcher the next, and he will act both ways all in one 
article or even on a single page of his books. When a person checks up on 
Wilson�s facts, they usually hold true. On my part the information about Brian 
Caennedi was astounding. I had to go as soon as possible to verify it from other 
sources, and it turns out Wilson was accurate about their genealogy,</font><sup><a href="#10."><font color="#FFFFFF">10</font></a></sup><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
and their importance in the Illuminati activities historically, etc.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="THE_ILLUMINATI_&amp;_MATTHEW_KENNEDY_">THE ILLUMINATI &amp; MATTHEW 
KENNEDY</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the chief lodges for the branch Illuminati prior to 1784 was located 
in a huge chateau at Ermenonville near Paris, France. The land belonged to the 
Marquis of Gerardin, who protected Rosseau and later gave Rosseau a tomb on his 
estate. St. Germain presided over this Illuminated lodge. This Illuminated lodge 
carried out blood rituals with a altar made from human bones. Interestingly, one 
of St. Germain�s good friends who came over from Ireland to Paris was Matthew 
Kennedy (1652-1735). Matthew Kennedy was connected with St. Germain�s court, and 
wrote A Chronological. Genealogical and Historical Dissertation of the Royal 
Family of the Stuarts. In 1613, the Stuart family had married into the Sang 
raal, and began to play a role in the genealogies of the Prieure de Sion. 
Frederick of the Palatinate after he married Elizabeth Stuart established an 
occult �Rosicrucian� state. It was Frederick who helped start the bloody 30 yrs. 
war between the Protestants and Catholics. The Stuarts spread the Scottish Rite 
of Freemasonry throughout Europe. For a while the Prieure de Sion seems to have 
backed the Stuarts, but at some point quit. St. Germain is revered as a Christ 
figure by the I AM movement and the Church Universal Triumphant, and other new 
age groups. A picture that looks similar to Christ, but which is actually a 
picture of St. Germain hangs in many of the houses of people involved with the I 
AM movement or its spin-offs. It is significant that an Irish Kennedy who was 
interested and liked the Stuart dynasty would be part of St. Germain�s court and 
a popular writer for them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">If John F. Kennedy had not been assassinated and so much about his life 
examined and written about, a window allowing us to see the Kennedy Illuminati 
family may never have opened so wide. First, the assassination attracted 
attention. In recent years, the Illuminati have given permission to publishing 
houses to print exposes of J.F.K.�s sexual life, etc.</font><sup><a href="#11."><font color="#FFFFFF">11</font></a></sup><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
It is believed that this permission was given in an effort to deflect criticism 
of his assassination by allowing his reputation to be tarnished.</font><sup><a href="#12."><font color="#FFFFFF">12</font></a></sup><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
(I hope my readers are beginning to realize that things are totally corrupt at 
the top, and that JFK was no different than so many others that have been and 
are today at the top of the political mess in this nation.) </font></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">John F. Kennedy had a very active sex life, even after he married Jackie, and 
even after he was President in the White House. For those who don�t think 
secrets can be kept by the elite, one only has to look at how John F. Kennedy 
was able to have sex with many women while President and to have frequent nude 
swim parties at the White House pool and the general public not know anything 
about it.</font><sup><a href="#13."><font color="#FFFFFF">13 </font> </a></sup>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">John F. Kennedy�s lust for women was well known by the elite. Illuminatus 
McGeorge Bundy warned his friend JFK (while JFK was a Senator) that John�s 
openness with women might get him into trouble with the public. John F. Kennedy 
was so open about his sexual habit, that at one party at the Mayflower Hotel in 
Washington, D.C. John F. Kennedy openly had sex with one partner in front of the 
party, while his friend Senator Estes Kefauver did the same. Then they swapped 
partners and began again in plain view. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">John F. Kennedy had many &quot;one-night-stands&quot; as the world calls them. These 
were merely women hustled up by his aides or the secret service or his friends 
like Frank Sinatra. But Kennedy also had long term relationships with some of 
the women he was sexually active with. It is those relationships which reveal so 
much about the hidden Satanic side of the Kennedys. John F. Kennedy had three 
long term girlfriends, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Mansfield, and Zsa Zsa Gabor which 
were ALSO girlfriends of Anton LaVey, who has headed the Church of Satan. Jayne 
Mansfield was a high priestess of the Church of Satan. Marilyn Monroe was a 
participant in LaVey�s satanic rituals before LaVey founded his Church of Satan. 
Both JFK and his brother Robert Kennedy had affairs going with Marilyn Monroe, 
and both visited her just prior to her mysterious death. Zsa Zsa has been 
interested for years in the occult. (JFK also had relationships with other women 
connected with the Illuminati also.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Before we examine the significance of these three relationships of JFK�s, and 
before we get into his liaisons with other women who were Illuminati connected, 
let�s cover the relationship between Anton LaVey and the Illuminati. California 
was very fertile soil for Satanism due to a host of factors. Two lesser known 
factors are that there were Haitian communities which practiced voodoo in 
California at the early part of this century. Also California became a haven for 
witches and Satanists fleeing from France, So. America, Cuba, and other places 
where their Satanic practices were not tolerated.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>
California had a reputation for acceptance of their evil rituals. When one adds 
to this such things as Hollywood it is easy to see how San Bernandino valley has 
become such a strong Satanic center. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Anton LaVey�s maternal grandmother was from Transylvannia. It was from that 
side of the family the Anton got some encouragement toward the occult. Anton La 
Vey loved horror movies. He studied Aleister Crowley, and the O.T.O. which had 
lodges in California which is where he lived, and in 1947 he joined the Clyde 
Beatty Circus. The Beatty family connects in with the Illuminati families also 
by the way. LaVey worked for several circuses and learned how to be a showman. 
He worked the occult sideshows of the circus, and found that people wanted to 
believe occult frauds. Anton LaVey found Marilyn Monroe, a Jewish girl, working 
as a striptease in the strip clubs. LaVey helped her performance, and through 
his connections got her started on her big career. LaVey used his talent of 
showmanship to create a type of Satanism that could be marketed to the public. 
LaVey always manages to walk a tight-rope between openly supporting hard-core 
Satanic practices such as human sacrifice and being just simply theatrics. In 
other words, he blatantly supports enough evil to attract evil people, but he 
publicly never allows himself to be connected in any way with child molestation, 
human sacrifice, etc. Anton LaVey was into Satanism before the 1960�s, but it 
was not until 1966 that he founded the Church of Satan. Some hard core Satanists 
feel he is &quot;all show,&quot; other hard core Satanists form covens and try to serve 
Anton LaVey, because they view him as a role model.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Illuminati set up their headquarters in Southern California this century. 
San Bernadino county is their headquarters. Of course as I have written before 
that the Illuminati is too secret to carry out any thing themselves. They need 
co-workers. The Illuminati is strictly hereditary. The Illuminati secretly 
control the Satanic cults at what is sometimes described as Stage 4 and Stage 5 
of Satanism. The lower levels are for recruits, the grunts, the privates so to 
speak in Satan�s army. In the San Bernadino area, one type of high priest of 
Stage 2 or 3 is the Master Counselor. Other positions include the Keeper of the 
Books, and the Keeper of the Seal. In the late �60s, Mike Warnke, who was a high 
priest, a Master Counselor, raised the number of Satanists in the first 3 stages 
to 1,500 members in the San Bernadino area (San Bernandino-Riverside-Colton). 
Bear in mind that these 1,500 active Satanists are not Illuminati members--they 
are much lower than the lower Illuminati ranks such as the Sisters of Light. The 
Sisters of Light and Five-Star generals and an Asmodeus who are the middle 
management types of the World Order who direct the upper levels of priests of 
the covens of Satanism that are open to the public. Anton LaVey participates in 
conferences for the occult where Satanism (the first 3 stages) and secret 
Illuminati overseers are present. In other words, LaVey is not out of touch with 
hard core Satanism, he just manages to keep his public profile clean. It is 
meant that way. Anton LaVey is a publicity agent to give Satanism a good image.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="MARILYN_MONROE_">MARILYN MONROE</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Anton LaVey knew how to be a showman. He took Marilyn Monroe, helped her with 
her acting and with his connections helped her get a chance to act. John F. 
Kennedy had a long term relationship with Marilyn Monroe. When J.F.K. was 
elected at the convention to be the Presidential candidate the Kennedy's threw a 
party at the convention. The party was described this way, &quot;every delegate at 
the convention was provided by the Kennedy group with anything they wanted for 
their entertainment including liquor and women sent to their room.&quot; JFK spent 
the time at the convention and the next day afterwards &quot;making love� to Marilyn 
Monroe. After his acceptance speech the whole group went over to his close 
friend Peter Lawford's for a skinny-dipping party. Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra 
and Sammy Davis, Jr. were close friends to each other and to John F. Kennedy. 
Sammy Davis, Jr. became a member of the Church of Satan after LaVey started it. 
From the middle of 1955 to the end of 1959 JFK had a suite on the 8th floor of 
Washington�s Mayflower Hotel set aside for his extramarital affairs. (FBI File)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">During the 1960�s Jayne Mansfield and John F. Kennedy had their relationship. 
They met at places like Beverly Hills, Malibu, Palm Springs. JFK had several men 
who &quot;bearded&quot; for him. That is they would act like the women JFK was to get, 
were their own date. One of these was Dave Powers, who even went so far as to 
write in a book Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye that whenever Jackie left Washington. 
JFK (Jack) and him would eat together and then the President would say his 
prayers and go to bed alone. One of the things Dave Powers did was to help 
procure a steady stream of new women for Jack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Some of the other on-going sexual relationship that JFK maintained were:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">- Lady Jean Campbell-daughter of the Duke of Argyll</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">??Flo Pritchett Smith-wife of the American Ambassador to Cuba</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">- Kay-Kay Hannon Auchincloss - (In this case although they had a long term 
close relationship no-ones knows what they did together.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">- Judith Campbell Exner- Judith was Sinatra�s girlfriend who he passed on as 
a favor. Judith worked for the Mafia, in particular she worked for Sam Giancana 
and John Roselli, who for some reason also both worked for the CIA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Exner ran letters between the Mafia and John F. Kennedy while he was 
President. (according to People Magazine, &quot;The Dark Side of Camelot&quot;, Feb. 29, 
1988.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It is also known that JFK was in direct contact with Meyer Lansky and Joe 
Fishetti, two other Mafia chiefs, and that he benefit from money they passed on 
to him. This is no surprise because Jack�s father had worked with the Mafia 
Jack�s entire life. There are a number of respectable books by ex-Satanists or 
ex-Organized Crime members where they are clear about how those groups love to 
blackmail people. John F. Kennedy certainly could have been easily blackmailed 
by these groups if they had wanted to. I haven�t seen any indication that 
blackmail was even tried, so the only other conclusion, which fits a lot of 
evidence, is that John F. Kennedy worked with the Satanists and the Mafia. In 
fact, the Mafia rigged several important counties in the election, like in 
Chicago, which tipped the scales in John winning the Presidency. That�s an 
entirely different thing that this article won�t get sidetracked on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="A_POEM_BY_JACKIE_">A POEM BY JACKIE</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Something that Jackie wrote on their honeymoon about Jack seems to me 
significant. When Jack and Jackie we<span lang="en-gb">re</span> newlyweds after 
their wedding Sept. 1953, the President of Mexico Don Miguel Alem�n, let Jackie 
and Jack use his villa. During their use of the Mexican President�s villa, 
Jackie wrote a poem about John her new husband.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;He would find love<br>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the writing projects that I have wanted to see done, and I have 
delegated it to a good friend, is to give my readers an article on MJ-12, a.k.a. 
the Wise Men, or the Study Group. This group of men actually run the United 
States. I know a good deal about the Study Group, in fact if my sources are 
correct it isn�t a formal group anymore. There are not formal meetings, but 
rather meetings happen at random with people &quot;accidentally bumping into each 
other.&quot; MJ-12 draws members from the Jason Society and the Jason Group. Both the 
Jason Society and the Jason Group are named after Jason and the Golden fleece. 
There are reasons to believe that Jackie knew some of the way the power 
structure operated. Jackie was good friends with many of the top Illuminati men 
in this nation. In fact, she ended up marrying Onassis, who was a King in Moriah 
(the Illuminati). Could Jackie have meant in this poem that Jack was wanting to 
climb the ladder clear up to The Golden Fleece, i.e. the Jason Society and 
MJ-12?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="JOSEPH_KENNEDY_">JOSEPH KENNEDY</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Joseph Kennedy was John F. Kennedy�s father. Through various means I 
independently learned that Joseph Kennedy was part of the Illuminati. He was a 
member of the Pilgrim Society (a 60 of the branch Illuminati). He also worked 
closely with the Mafia, and other Kingpins in the Illuminati. Perhaps in another 
article we can cover more about Joseph Kennedy. This article is about long 
enough. I thought I might wrap it up with a story about Joseph Kennedy. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The story demonstrates that much of what politicians tell the public is 
simply for their own benefit, and often only lies. Jack Kennedy got the 
reputation after Britain and the Germany began fighting in W.W. II, as being 
against the United States entering the war. Jack Kennedy held the prestigious 
job of being the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain at the time. The fact that 
Jack Kennedy was given such an extremely vital position shows that the Kennedy 
family is important within the Illuminati. At that point in time, like no other 
time, it was important who the U.S. had as ambassador. After the war began, and 
both countries had martial law, and extensive military communications, the 
ambassador was really not quite so critical in his role. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the men who worked at the embassy for the Americans was an American 
Tyler Gatewood Kent, a career officer in the U.S. Consular service. Tyler Kent 
believed in a world conspiracy before he began working in the code room. While 
he worked there he was astonished that Roosevelt was secretly involving the 
United States in W.W. II and lying to the American public. Further, Roosevelt 
was pulling strings to get us involved while lying to the public. Kent secretly 
took 1,500 pgs. of secret documents, which he was going to show to the public to 
expose the conspiracy. Kent never made it. He was arrested.<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp;
</span>In order for the British to hold him, Jack Kennedy had to revoke his 
diplomatic immunity on May 20, 1940. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Ambassador Joe Kennedy did that so he could receive a harsh sentence, because 
if he had been brought back to America, the public might have gotten outraged at 
what the politicians had done. According to Standard Operating Procedure and 
protocol, Kent should have stood trial in the U.S. The papers he had taken were 
American embassy papers not British. Although the court records show that no 
evidence was introduced that Kent was a spy, Joseph Kennedy later would concoct 
a long story for the public that Kent was a Nazi spy. Kennedy went on speaking 
engagements around the U.S. after he was relieved of his Ambassador post, and 
Kennedy made it sound like he was whole heartedly against the war. If Kennedy 
had really been against the war, if he had simply denied the British the chance 
to keep Kent, Kent could have spilled the beans about what Roosevelt was doing 
and the outraged would have destroyed Roosevelt�s chances to fool the American 
people. Instead, Roosevelt was able to proceed and develop the elements for the 
Pearl Harbor attack. While Kennedy pretended to be against the war, he was 
serving as an intimate accomplice in maneuvers designed to fool the American 
people. This is a good example of how even today the public is looking to 
certain public officials to save them. They think that these politicians will 
try everything possible to help them fight the system, so when they fail to beat 
the system, the people think they have been beaten fairly. </font></p>

family. (This is a common Illuminati tactic. It seems many of the Illuminati 
men, look for a wife who will gain them respectability. Often wives like this 
are not even brought into the Illuminati activities, so that they can be the 
best cover possible.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Kennedy�s mob connection has been written about, but perhaps two are worth 
pointing out again. Joseph Linsey who was a kingpin of organized crime in New 
England and a partner in crime with Meyer Lansky was a crime business partner 
with Joseph Kennedy. Joseph Linsey in fact was listed as the top contributor to 
Ted Kennedy�s Senate race one year. Andr� Meyer, head of the Meyer family, was 
manager of the Kennedy estates. One other business partner of Kennedy was the 
Bronfmans, who are powerful Illuminati figures in Canada. Kennedy was in 
business with Newark�s Reinfield Syndicate of which the Bronfman�s owned 50%. 
Winston Churchill, whose connections to the elite, are brought out in other 
newsletters, personally gave the grant to Joe Kennedy which gave him the Brit. 
alcoholic distiller�s franchise for the American market.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">After Joe Kennedy became the Amer. Ambassador to Britain, we can catch a 
glimpse of how powerful the Illuminati are. The British Royal Family at the 
request of Joseph Kennedy put on their full royal regalia for the Kennedy 
family. When Kennedy arrived in Britain as American ambassador, he contacted the 
Astors and the Sassoons. Sir John Wheeler-Bennett founder and head of RIIA�s 
research division is credited by those in the know as having written Kennedy�s 
master thesis, which was later made into a book Why England Slept. Perhaps one 
of the items that best shows the hidden power behind Kennedy is his daughters 
marriage to William Cavendish and Joseph Kennedy�s comments about it. Kathleen 
married the Duke of Devonshire. The Duke of Devonshire was very prestigious 
position within the British nobility. Dukes are second only to the monarchy. 
Joseph Kennedy was often heard saying. &quot;If Kathleen and her husband were living, 
I�d be the father of the Duchess of Devonshire (first Lady-in-Waiting to the 
Queen) and the father-in-law of the head of all the Masons in the world.&quot; 
(Koskoff, David E. Joseph P.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Kennedy: A Life and 
Times. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., p. 378.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Joseph Kennedy was in the British branch of the Knights of Malta which is 
called the Order of St. John. Interestingly, Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis� 
sister Lee married Prince Stanislaus Radziwill. The Radziwill family established 
the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (that�s the Knights of Malta) in Poland in 
1610. They also helped establish the Order in the U.S. (See the article on the 
Knights of Malta this issue.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Another tie in between the Kennedy's and the Knights of Malta concerns the 
Hospice movement. The Kennedy Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction and 
Bioethics (located at the Jesuit�s Georgetown Univ.) is helping fund the Knights 
of Malta�s hospice movement in America. In Oct. 1978, the first annual meeting 
of the National Hospice Organization took place. Sen. Edward Kennedy was one of 
the two keynote speakers. What is the hospice movement which is being conducted 
by the Hospitallers (one of the names the Knights of Malta go by)? It is a 
movement to allow old people &quot;The Right to Die.� </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Knights of Malta have an ancient history of running drugs and in 
administering mind altering drugs in their hospitals instead of giving medicine. 
This ancient activity was carried forth into modern times when their St. 
Christopher�s hospital in London began giving patients Brompton Mixture until 
they died. Brompton Mixture consists of heroin, cocaine, alcohol, tranquilizers, 
and chloroform water. This mixture is given in the Knights of Malta hospitals to 
patients every three hours until they die. Euthanasia, or &quot;mercy killing&quot; may 
seem like a merciful idea, until a person finds out how the people at the top of 
the Euthanasia movement view things. They view things similar to the Satanist 
Adolf Hitler. This view is that it is merciful to get rid of unwanted people. 
Although the &quot;death&quot; hospice movement seems benevolent at first, it is the 
conclusion of where the program will end up that is the kicker. Hospice, Inc. 
which is linked to the elite is also provided funding by the Kaiser Foundation.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Besides ties to running drugs, the Kennedy Clan has had their problems with 
drugs. Ted Kennedy�s daughter Kara was on drugs and ended up in a halfway house. 
Bobby Kennedy�s kids were busted for drugs. Joan Kennedy was having problems 
with alcoholism. David Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. both have been 
addicted to hard drugs in spite of repeated treatments in detoxification 
centers. David later &quot;O-D&quot;ed (overdosed) on cocaine and died in 1984. Pat�s 
Kennedy Lawford�s husband was dependent on drugs and alcohol. It is not well 
known that the Illuminati have long used drugs. Elite people such as the 
Rothschild's, Winston Churchill in London and the Royal Family were using all 
cocaine, heroin and opium (not to mention occult ceremonies too). Queen 
Victoria, thought by many to be such a straight laced lady and her guests 
regularly used large quantities of cocaine and heroin. The royal summer 
residence was Balmoral and this was the site of frequent drug use, and one has 
to wonder what else.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This revisit to the Kennedy�s shows some of their ties to other elements of 
the Illuminati�s vast scheme of things. Until people begin to recognize that the 
Kennedy�s wielded an occult power via their bloodline, they will not begin to 
appreciate why the Queen of England and her family would honor a request from an 
Irish commoner to have her family dress up in full regalia for the pleasure of 
this commoner�s family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The friendship Winston Churchill had with Billy Graham,<span lang="en-gb">
</span>with Joe Kennedy, and his very close relationship with<span lang="en-gb">
</span>Onassis have recently been discussed. Churchill was an<span lang="en-gb">

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="FOLLOW_UP_ON_THE_KENNEDY_FAMILY_">FOLLOW UP ON THE KENNEDY FAMILY</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There has been new attention focused on the Kennedy's. JFK�s widow died and 
then his mother Rose has also died recently. Last year, I read a book which was 
very well researched. It is entitled <i>A Question of Character A Life of John 
F. Kennedy by Thomas C. Reeves</i>. The book does away with all the propaganda, 
media hype and lies, and tells the truth about the Kennedy's. The book is well 
documented. The author spent a great deal of energy trying to find out the truth 
about JFK. What emerges is not public image that is so well known. JFK had only 
about a 119 I.Q., did very poorly in school, and could barely spell. JFK�s 
father had the wealth and connections to buy his son anything. Although Kennedy 
had a back problem which made him almost crippled, his father got him into the 
Navy during W.W. II. When he was let in, the examining doctors looked the other 
way at his back problem (which plagued him his entire life). Kennedy got a 
commission as a Naval officer without having to go through the normal channels 
of training and being commissioned. As a naval officer he did a poor job, and 
the great PT-109 story was far different than what the public has been lead to 
believe. The fact that Kennedy let his boat be run over by a Jap destroyer was 
because he and his crew weren�t paying attention (sleeping, hung over etc.) 
Kennedy realized he might be court marshalled for his negligence, but his father 
had the money to turn disaster into a story that made Kennedy into a hero.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Some of the things you will learn from the book follow. In the chapter <i>The 
Founding Family</i> we learn about PJ. Kennedy who was JFK�s grandfather. He 
dropped out of grammar school, but by the age of 25 he somehow had ownership of 
a saloon and a liquor business. Later, he sold his liquor interests and went 
into banking. He also went into politics and via corruption was a successful 
politician. He won elections by hiring men to vote repeatedly for him. Joe 
Kennedy remembered 2 Ward heelers proudly telling Joe Kennedy�s father who was 
on the election commission, &quot;Pat, we voted 128 times today.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Joe, PJ�s son, married Rose Fitzgerald. The Fitzgerald's were a mighty 
Italian clan that had helped William the Conqueror become ruler of England. 
Honey Fitz was her father and he had a reputation for graft and vote fraud, as 
well as a not so secret notorious affair with a girl named &quot;Toodles.&quot; Rose got 
her education in the Catholic Sacred Heart Convent which she completed a month 
before her 20th birthday. Her father was removed from the House of 
Representatives after voting fraud was uncovered. Joe was acquainted with 
Roosevelt when FDR was only an Ass. Secretary of the Navy. Joe became an insider 
with the stock market, and knew how to manipulate stock prices to fleece the 
small fish that tried to play the stock market. Various gangster reported that 
during prohibition they had smuggled illegal liquor into the U.S. with Joe 
Kennedy. Joe worked with David Sarnoff and his Radio Corp. of America. Joe had 
an extremely varied sexual life; he had affairs with countless women, and his 
son JFK followed in his footsteps. Joe bought a 15 room, nine bath home in 
Hyannis Port, Mass. on Nantucket Sound.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This became a favorite summer home of the Kennedy clan. He also bought a 
six-bedroom Spanish style house on the fashionable North Ocean Boulevard in Palm 
Beach, FL which became the clan�s winter home. Rose is described as 
�self-centered, stingy, prudish. and often spiteful.� Her servants called her 
&quot;Madame&quot;. Rather than being the model mother that is pictured to the American 
public by the Kennedy's, she was often gone. JFK told his mother off at age 5, 
&quot;Gee, you�re a great mother to go away and leave your children alone.&quot; As an 
adult, JFK confided to a friend. &quot;My mother was either at some Paris fashion 
house or else on her knees in some church. She was never there when we really 
needed her....My mother never really held me and hugged me. Never! Never!� 
Further, his father�s lack of respect for his mother led JFK to say, &quot;My mother 
is a nothing.&quot; (p.40) Imagine growing up without a mother to hug and kiss you! 
JFK�s father �tolerated littie nonsense and no disobedience.&quot; (p.33) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The life JFK lived at home was not a life of compassion, but one of rigid 
obedience. The children were stripped of many things ordinary children would 
have. They didn�t even have their own rooms. (p. 41) Most children have a room 
of their own sometime in which to place their belongings and nick-knacks. The 
few times JFK as a boy invited friends over, they were frightened to death at 
how his father would fly into a rage and give the Kennedy boys a tongue-lashing. 
The children were not allowed to express pain. For instance, when one of the 
Kennedy�s were hurt and came to his mother for sympathy she ordered, �On your 
feet, now you know how to behave. Go out there and behave as you know you 
should.� It is highly likely this strictness was related to some type of 
mind-control which even then was practiced by Satanic families. Joe had his 
daughter given a prefrontal lobotomy and then banished to a nursing convent. 
From then on his daughter Rosemary did not exist. One wonders what the full 
story was about Rosemary. Was she sexually abused as is done to so many of the 
elite�s daughters of Satanic families? Felix Frankfurter who played such a 
prominent role with Charles T. Russell was a good friend of Joe�s.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">JFK managed to hide from the public during his life the fact that he wore 
glasses, and also to some degree his intense back pain which hurt him intensely. 
On page 40 we learn that JFK was unable to ever have a self-revealing 
conversation. JFK had a total lack of ability to relate, everything was very 
surface in his relations with people. He was very skilled at picking up women, 
and getting them to bed. And he had many good friends. However, he didn�t have 
the ability to love or relate to others. This is another clue that he may have 
had some type of SRA abuse. On page 40, Reeves writes, �At the root of it were 
months of loneliness and their parents often selfish, insensitive behavior.&quot; But 
I wonder if it didn�t go deeper. From what I know from informers it goes deeper 
and involves SRA. JFK wasn�t even told of his brother Teddy�s birth, until he 
came home from boarding school and discovered he had another brother. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">JFK was very unsuccessful at most everything he did. His father had so much 
influence and power that he could get his son out of almost any difficulty. A 
friend of JFK�s recalled, &quot;With Jack, nobody really admired what he did or 
respected what he did but they liked his personality. When he flashed his smile, 
he could charm a bird off a tree.&quot; At the age of 17, Jack went to Harlem to a 
brothel. Later, he nicknamed his sexual organ JJ.&quot; Meanwhile his father was the 
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and an informal adviser 
to Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt. I might add here, that if you look closely you 
will find the Illuminati Kings are the advisers to the Presidents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I have mentioned some of these already, like in the article on the Bundy 
Illuminati family. Another example may be found in the book <i>The Old Boys- The 
American Elite &amp; The Origins of the CIA by Burton Hersh</i>. On page 41 of The 
Old Boys we learn that President Eisenhower�s Special Assistant for Cold War 
Strategy was Nelson Rockefeller. The most dangerous situation this country has 
ever been in was the threat of the Russian military, and who was the primary 
advisor to our President Eisenhower during his term as a U.S. President during 
the Cold War? Illuminati King Nelson Rockefeller. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">JFK went for one year to the London School of Economics according to the 
story given the public. Actually he went there for one month, didn�t do any 
academic work and came back home. But it is significant that his father tried to 
send him to a school in which so many of the elite have gone to. JFK had help in 
writing and putting out a book entitled Why England Slept<span lang="en-gb">.
</span>&nbsp;Henry Luce, who headed Time-Life and who was a good friend of Joe 
Kennedy gave the book good publicity in Time magazine, and his father bought 
between 30,000 to 40,000 of the books and stored them in the attic and basement 
of his Hyannis Port home in order to make Jack�s (JFK) book a best seller.
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When JFK went to California in 1940, one of the places he stayed at was with 
William Randolph Hearst, who is another Illuminati figure, at his coastal 
castle. Hearst would give help to Kennedy later on too. When Kennedy ran in 
politics, Heart�s Boston American wouldn�t even accept Kennedy�s opponent�s paid 
political advertisements. Joe Kennedy worked for the FBI after W.W.II. (p. 59) 
JFK�s favorite sister Kathleen, married William Hartington, who's father was the 
tenth duke of Devonshire, a pillar of the Church of England (called the 
Episcopalian church in the US.) and a high ranking Freemason. After marrying 
him, she had an affair with aristocrat Peter Milton, Lord Fitzwilllam. After 
Joe, Jr. died, JFK�s father started grooming JFK to become President.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">After Jack was elected to the House of Representatives, his three best 
congressional friends were Richard Russell, Spessard Holland, and Robert A. 
Taft. Notice that two of these are from well-known Illuminati families, the 
Taft's and the Russell's. By the way, the occult Taft's and occult Russell 
families have intermarried. Because there is so much disinformation out about 
the people who run this country, it must sometimes seem rather bizarre that 
people like me come along and say there is a satanic conspiracy of great 
magnitude. If Americans were as a whole critical thinkers and would challenge 
the propaganda that the controlled media gives them, then the false fronts and 
false public images of their leaders might not get written up so easily as 
history. There are not many critical thinkers in this nation. There are a great 
many intelligent people, but not a great many critical thinkers. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A conspiracy of great magnitude has had this nation in its grips since the 
nation was founded, and the controlled press has managed to prevent the general 
population from finding this conspiracy out. The Kennedy Family has played a 
role in that conspiracy. JFK gave his life to that conspiracy. The assassination 
of JFK is one of the best ways to introduce Americans to the conspiracy. Ralph 
Epperson who gives talks/slideshows about the NWO to groups likes to use the 
Kennedy Assassination as a method to get people to realize that there is a NWO 
conspiracy. Interestingly, Ralph Epperson, had as a companion for a while 
without knowing it, an active Monarch slave who helped him give presentations. 
It is difficult for those exposing the NWO to get away from being infiltrated. 
The Monarch mind-controlled slaves are very difficult to detect, especially 
since most people don�t even know that they exist.</font></p>

man who wakes up in the middle of the night while everyone else sleeps and then 
gropes around in the darkness trying to feel his way. I can share with you what 
I�ve learned, but undoubtedly there is a great deal more that can be learned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When the year started I knew only a little about the Li family, and that only 
from what I had heard. I didn�t even know how to spell their name right. I was 
spelling it Lee (Actually the Li family name is spelled Lee in some areas such 
as Hokkien, Teochew, Singapore and by some Chinese Americans.) Because I knew so 
little about the family, it was one of my primary areas of focus when doing</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A Chinese is name is made up of a family name (surname), which is written 
first, and then comes the personal name. In the Chinese way of things my name 
would be Springmeier Fritz. Family names are usually of one character each, 
although there are exceptions like Ouyong and Situ. There are over 6,000 Chinese 
surnames for about I billion Chinese. The more frequent Chinese surnames in 
English speaking countries such as the U.S., U.K., &amp; Aust. are Chan, Lin, Li, 
Wong, Huang, Mei, Yang, Chin, and Fong. In mainland China the 5 top families are 
Chen, Li, Zhang, He, and Huang.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Chinese surname Li is a very popular name in China, perhaps not as 
widespread as Smith in this country, but certainly used as much as the name 
Brown is in America. Chinese who have the same surname have much more loyalty to 
someone else who has the same surname. For instance, two Chinese with the Li 
name would consider themselves relatives even if they were total strangers. Even 
if two people knew no blood ties, if they had the same surname it has generally 
been considered incestuous to marry each other in China. In the U.S. if two 
Browns without any apparent blood ties met each other, they would not feel as if 
they were close relatives which two Chinese with the same surname would.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Li surname has a long history which goes back to a specific person named 
Emperor Zhuanzu who was the first Li and lived before 2000 B.C. This is 
according to the Xing Zuan, the Chinese dictionary of surnames.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Li family has a long history in China with many stories. During the Tang 
Dynasty about 15 different surnames were given the honor of having the Li 
surname. Li Yuan was the founder of the Tang Dynasty which lasted from 618 to 
906 A.D. His son who ruled after him was Li Shimin. In their dynasty, printing 
and paper money were introduced to China. (It�s interesting that the Li�s are 
connected the introduction of paper money.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span lang="en-gb">I</span> don�t know which of the Li�s are closely related 
and which are not. I do know that Li�s control Red China, Hong Kong, and 
Singapore and have important positions in Taiwan. If the various Li�s which 
control these various nations are related, then we are certainly looking at one 
of the most powerful families in the world. In terms of power, they would be 
just as powerful as the Rockefellers. They also connect to secret occult 
societies, but the secret societies which the Li�s are major players in are the 
Chinese secret societies. Those will be covered elsewhere in this newsletter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="WHICH_ONES_ARE_PART_OF_THE_ILLUMINATI_">WHICH ONES ARE PART OF 
THE ILLUMINATI?</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I have learned from a source that Li Ka-shing and the powerful Hong Kong Li�s 
are definitely part of the Satanic illuminati Li�s. <span lang="en-gb">I</span>n 
terms of whether the Li�s who run Red China are part of the Illuminati, I know 
nothing that directly connects them. However, there are clues that make one 
wonder. For instance, why do the Rockefellers and Rothschild's have such a cozy 
relationship with these Red Chinese Li�s. Why does the Premier (or Prime 
Minister) of the People�s Republic of China Li Peng visit with the Rockefellers 
and other capitalists when he comes to New York City, if he is such a hard-line 
communist? Haven�t the Communists named the Capitalists their major enemy?
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">And then when we watch men who are In the Illuminati such as Skull &amp; Bones 
George Bush treat the Chinese Li�s with such closeness, even when it was Li Peng 
that crushed innocent people at Tiennamen Square, it makes us wonder still. In 
fact, with other pieces of the puzzle that I have in place, I do know that Red 
China is already cooperating with and part of the New World Order. The only way 
that China could already be secretly part of the New World Order Is for it�s 
leaders who are the Li family to be in favor of the New World Order. This 
strongly suggests that the Li family In China is also part of the Illuminati. 
From what I know the range of possibilities range from them being only 
sympathizers with the NWO elite to them being outright members of the 
Illuminati. I lean toward the latter view.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Then there is </font>
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Singapore">Singapore</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">. Singapore is lock 
stock and barrel in the New World Order. They went to a cashless Society before 
anyone else. One of the Li family who spells his name Lee, Lee Kuan Yew, a 
Cambridge-educated lawyer, was dictator of Singapore for decades. He has ties to 
the British elite. As an example of his dictatorship, Lee didn�t like long hair 
on men, and so men coming into Singapore with long hair would have their 
passports taken away and either got a haircut or went to jail. In 1959, when 
Britain gave Singapore its Independence the Li family (In this case also spelled 
Lee) controlled the People�s Action Party which ruled the country. In 1976, the 
People�s Action Party monopolized politics so much that they won all 69 seats 
for Parliament. Lee Kuan Yew was placed into the all-powerful position of 
President in 1965, where he remained I believe until 1991. Singapore�s leaders 
made Singapore very anti-communist during the cold war, and when Nixon began his 
trips to woo China., Singapore began making goodwill political mission to China. 
In 1975, Lee�s henchman Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam went to China and met 
with Chou En-lai. Chou En-lai was the mentor and friend of U Peng.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Actually, to be more specific after Li Peng�s father, who was a leading 
communist, was shot by the nationalists In 1931, Chou Enlal more or less adopted 
Li Peng and raised him. Chou Enlal got U Peng into Moscow�s school system, 
where, when the Russians finally realized his brilliance wanted to keep Li Peng 
and train him for their own purposes, and U had to escape to back to China. For 
whatever reasons Li Peng was an advocate of the Soviet style of economics. 
Before being placed into his prominent position that he holds today, Li Peng 
managed China�s economy for many years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="Lee_met_Mao_">Lee met Mao</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1976, Lee Kuan Yew himself met with Mao Tse-Tung (then the leader of Red 
China). Mao Tsetuag himself is closely tied to the Li family. Li Ta-chao was the 
head of the communist party in Northern China during the fighting with the 
Nationalists. Mao�s bodyguard was a Li family member Li Yinqiao. Mao�s mentor 
was Li Ta-chao, who had ties to the Red Spears Secret Society. Other early high 
ranking communists such as Chu Teh, Ho Lung, and Liu Chib-tan had memberships in 
the Red Spears Secret Society and Li Ch�l-han an early communist leader was a 
member of the Green Gang Secret Society. We will cover more about the Li family 
and Its relationship to Chinese Secret Societies later, as weil as explaining 
some about the various powerful secret fraternities. It may well have been Li 
Ta-chao�s guidance that lead to Mao Tse-tung writing the first systematic 
attempt by a Chinese Marxist to characterize the class basis of secret 
societies, and emphasizing their importance for revolution. Mao cooperated with 
the Ko-Ino Hui, a secret society, that helped his revolution, but strangely the 
official collection of Mao�s works neglects to include Mao�s appeal to them for 
help. (This neglect is noted on pg. 4 of Popular Movements &amp; Secret Societies in 
China. 1840-1950) Mao Tse-Tung is also a product of the Harlot Christian church. 
Mao as a boy had wanted to learn of Christ and attend a Missionary school, but 
when he went to it, they threw him rudely out because he was Chinese. Mao never 
forgot the bad treatment he received at the hands of Christians. That explains 
in part his hatred of Christianity.</font></p>

has never been any lack of recruits for Chinese secret societies, and there has 
never been any lack of causes to use to rally the poor masses against for 
motivating people into joining secret societies. There seems to be no end to the 
supply of men willing to lead secret societies also. In fact, I know of over 250 
Chinese secret societies, some of which are no longer in existence. Obviously, 
we are not going to cover that many secret societies in this article.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">What criteria do I have for selecting what I will write about in this 
article. First, I desire to show the compatibility of Chinese secret societies 
to western secret societies. This compatibility is the reason that the Triads 
can work with the Mafia, the CIA, and the Illuminati. These points of 
compatibility explain how Freemasonry can work with some of the Chinese secret 
societies. For instance, I have a copy of The New Age magazine, Sept. 1964, p. 
38, which is put out by The Supreme Council 33� which states,</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">�Chinese Wootsu [sic] Society</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> Compared to Freemasonry</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">�Brother Morris B. de Pass, 33�, Master of Kadosh of the Peking Scottish Rite 
Bodies, in his annual report, includes the following interesting story in regard 
to Wootsu Society. �During the past year I had the pleasure of meeting an �Old 
China Hand,� himself a Scottish Rite Mason, who, learning of my China 
background, asked me If I had any knowledge of an old Chinese organization 
similar to Masonry. I felt certain he had in mind the �Wootsu Society� (Woo 
meaning 5, and Tsu meaning �Ancestor�) or, in English, �the Society of the Five 
Ancestors., &quot;...some foreigners living in China ... were of the opinion that The 
Society of the Five Ancestors was the Eastern Branch of that movement which 
developed in Western countries into Freemasonry .... The tenets of the Wootsu 
Society do have much in common with those of Freemasonry. They pay homage to 
Buddha, whom they accept as the incarnation of a Supreme Deity they believe in 
immortality they teach �Faithfulness unto Death�; and they practice secrecy. The 
Society differs from Masonry in that there is no counterpart of the Volume of 
the Sacred Law as being an indispensable part of its Furniture; ... and it is 
open to both men and women.�</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps no one better epitomizes the connections and overlap between East and 
West occult secret societies than the life of Sun-Yat-Sen. Sun-Yat-Sen led China 
to overthrow the monarchy and create a republic. Sun-YatSen was a leader in 
several Triad groups, such as the Hong Kong based Chung Wo Tong Society and the 
Kwok On Wui Society in Honolulu and Chicago. Soon after arriving in Hawaii he 
formed the Tai Luk Shan, a new Triad group. Sun-Yat-Sen played the key role in 
setting up 268 other branches of the Triads too. In Japan he set up the T�ung 
Meng Hui. In Singapore and Malaysla he set up Triad lodges too. He was a high 
ranking Freemason, and he attended an Anglican school in Hong Kong. Sun-Yat-Sen 
and the millionaire Chang ChingChang who was an international art dealer worked 
together. Sun-Yat-Sen traveled in the US. and Europe gaining support for his 
revolution. Several other great non-Communist Chinese leaders have also had 
membership in both the Triads and Freemasonry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="TRIAD_RITUALS_">TRIAD RITUALS</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Triad rituals were an elaborate affair but have continued to be streamlined 
over the years. The ritual initiation drew from 3 religious sources: Taoism 
(magic), Buddhism, and what might be called Confucianism. Taoism emphasized the 
importance of blood ancestry, of magic, and alchemy. The traditional initiation 
lasts about eight hours, and includes ritual dance, secret hand-shakes, a blood 
sacrifice, and pricking the finger of the new initiates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Triads have an extremely long history and a lot of heritage. In order to 
try to capsulize what they are one has to look at what they are doing at a 
particular moment. At times they are secret fraternity like the Masons, at other 
times they have more of the appearance of a revolutionary army, and at other 
times they look like the Mafia. They are all these things. And so they are a 
much more complex group to understand than some of the other secret societies 
that might fit into some nice label. Sometimes their services as hit men are 
hired out to others. Their heritage and history make them almost a sub-culture, 
and a sub-culture that is difficult for law enforcement agencies to penetrate. 
Their blood oaths and traditions bind them together.</font></p>

which in turn changed into the Triad Society also known as the Three United 
Society. Some people continued calling it the Hung Society. The Hung Society had 
many local names, and like Freemasonry hid behind trade guilds.</font></p>

Triad lodges sprang up in the Chinese laundrymen of San Francisco. By 1854, the 
Triad Society called �Five Companies� had 35,000 members in California. In the 
U.S. the Triad lodges became known as Tongs-which means a �hail� or �meeting 
place.� Where ever the Chinese lived they quietly set up Triad lodges so that 
soon there were lodges In Laramle, Cheyenne, Kansas City, Seattle, Vancouver, 
California, New York, Boston, and the Klondike. These overseas Triads came under 
the jurisdiction of the Hung Mun Society in Canton. This Triad group was in turn 
under Chi Kung Tong group. Groups got started in Australia and Malaya.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img height="231" alt="triads.jpg (86889 bytes)" src="triads.jpg" width="600"></font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When the British began ruling Hong Kong, the Hong Kong area already had a 
reputation for being a haven for pirates, and the Triads established lodges and 
began secretly to rule. In 1845, the British made membership in the Triads 
illegal, and in later years deported them back to communist China for those 
Triad members found. However, the Triads controlled things and the British never 
were able to enforce that law except for some scattered arrests. For Instance in 
the 1970s, 35% of the police in Hong Kong were affiliated with the Triads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In fact, the British man Ernest Taffy� Hunt, the Police Superintendent of the 
Thad Bureau of the Colony of Hong Kong was paid bribes for 18 years ranging from 
about $HK700,000 to $HK 12 per year starting in 1955.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Hong Kong papers every so often report police raids against the Triads, 
but one has to wonder how much is inter rivalry between Triad groups and much is 
just for show, and how much is really something hurting the Triads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Under Triad control factories in Hong Kong have been turning out items for 
sex shops worldwide. The living conditions of areas under Triad control in Hong 
Kong were literal hells on earth. The Triads packed people in, the sanitation 
was negligible, the filth overwhelming, and the corruption of the human spirit 
complete. There is no question what kind of life the Triads want to bring 
people, total degeneration into total moral corruption and filth. Like the 
Masons (but to a much lesser degree) there have been a few Triad mutual aid 
societies for their own members, but in general these have been rare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Triads have exacted extortion money from almost everyone in Hong Kong. 
The history of their extortions and threats etc. is many books long. In short, 
the whole trading economy of Hong Kong was under their power. And the Li family 
as now working with them. See the Li article in this issue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Various scandals over the decades have repeatedly shown that the Triads have 
totally infiltrated the Hong Kong government and police force. Where ever ethnic 
Chinese were hired the Triads infiltrated. And then even many of the non-Chinese 
were bought off. People in Hong Kong who have watched the Triads do illegal acts 
right in public have frequently been frustrated by the lack of police response.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="THE_TRIADS_&amp;_CHINA_">THE TRIADS &amp; CHINA</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Before the Communists took over, the Triads ran China. For instance, in 1917, 
it was discovered that the Triads along with the Vice-President of the Republic 
of China were stealing public funds to purchase opium to deal in the drug trade. 
The leaders of Free China have been Triad leaders. Many of them have also been 
Freemasons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">After the Communists took over, the Triads had to go way underground. The 
communists never stopped the Triads, but they did make them much more secret. 
You may remember when the Tiananmen Square Massacre occurred, the newspapers 
quietly reported that the Triads had smuggled the leaders of the democratic 
movement out of Red China. As was just said, the Communists have never broken 
the power of the Triads. In fact, not only has the brutal Red Chinese government 
been ineffective against the Triads, most of the police everywhere have been. 
The Triads are the most powerful criminal fraternal group in the world, except 
for the Illuminati and the families that make up the Illuminati�s Committee of 
300. The Mafia Is small peanuts compared to the Triads. The Triads are almost 
untouchable by any law enforcement group. For instance, in Great Britain the 
British do not have hardly any ethnic Chinese on their police force to even try 
infiltrating the Triads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Triads have operated in the United States for over 100 years, and are 
major drug handlers working in cooperation with the Illuminati Kings, and most 
Americans do not even know they exist. And although America has ethnic Chinese, 
Americans of Chinese descent do not speak the Chinese dialects that undercover 
agents would have to know to break into the Triad operations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="DIFFERENT_TRIAD_GROUPS_">DIFFERENT TRIAD GROUPS</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There are numerous Triad groups. By 1931, there were eight main Triad groups 
and they had divided Hong Kong up into geographic areas and ethnic groups that 
each was responsible to control. The eight main ones at that time were the Wo, 
the rung, the Tung, the Chuen, the Shing, the Fuk Yee Hing, the Yee On, and the 
Luen. Each had its own headquarters, its own sub-societies, and its own public 
covers. The Fuk Yee Hing�s cover was that it was registered as a benevolent 
society for workers. It had 12 branch offices and a membership of 10,000. Yee 
On�s cover was as the Yee On Commercial and Industrial Guild. The Wo operated as 
Death Gratuity associations. Any way each found some cover to hide behind. Most 
of the Martial Arts dubs were fronts or affiliations with the Triads, and 
continue to be, not only in Hong Kong, but to some degree in other countries 
too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As an example of how divided the Triad groups are--one of the large ones, the 
Wo Society was itself split into three major factions: Wo Shing Tong, Wo Yung 
Yee, and Wo Hop To, which for years struggled for domination of the Wo Society. 
By the late 1950s, there were 41 affiliated organizations to the Wo Society 
Triad. Today the Wo Shing Wo is the most powerful of the Wo group Triads.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the Triad groups that works with the Illuminati is the Sun Yee On aka 
Yee On Commercial and Industrial Guild. Sun Vee On was the prime controller of 
the Kowloon Walled City which produced sex toys for the international market.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Besides the Wo Shing Wo and the Sun Yee On, the third great Triad societies 
of modern times Is the 14K Society. Probably Chiang Kai-shek and his mentor 
Big-Eared Tu were responsible for setting up a league to oversee all the various 
Triad groups called Five Continents Overseas Chinese Hung League. This was set 
up In 1945, when the Chinese operated in Asia, North America, South America, 
Europe and Africa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As a side note on Tu, one of his friends was Charlie Soong (an office-bearer 
for the Triads) who had attended Vanderbilt Universisty at the expense of 
millionaire Julian S. Can. Chalie Soong�s daughter Al-lag had connections to 
Sun-Yat-Sen, and also became helpful to the Triads when she married Kung 
Hsiang-hsi a banker and businessman. The Kung banking empire along with the 
Soong�s veneer of Christianity which came from their Methodist Church membership 
helped this branch of Triads in their international dealings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Today in Hong Kong there may be as many as 60 different Triad Societies 
operating. The largest numerically is the Sun Yee On with 33,000 members. These 
60 Societies can be classed into three different styles. The first is the 
traditional structure. The second type are those who are totally unstructured. 
The third type is the most dangerous, they are small, closely knit cells or 
central committees who plan out criminal activity with acute business-like 
efficiency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="LARGE_BASES_OF_TRIAD_OPERATIONS_">LARGE BASES OF TRIAD OPERATIONS</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Vancouver, B.C., San Francisco, New York, London, Manchester, and Amsterdam 
(not to mention Macao and Hong Kong) are some of the big bases of Triad 
Operation. Money is made by extortion, gambling, prostitution, drugs, or any 
other way to make a profit. The Triads have worked with the CIA in creating the 
drug network. The creation of the Golden Triangle as a source for drugs was a 
joint CIA-Triad operation. The Chinese communists couldn�t pass up the 
opportunity to debauch America. The Red Chinese government has secretly worked 
with the Triads in supplying heroin and opium knowing that these drugs were 
going to U.S. military bases. U.S. garrisons <span lang="en-gb">i</span>n 
Germany were supplied high grade drugs that came through the Triads, either 
grown under Triad supervision or in places like Red China. One of the kingpins 
in this drug trade was Lumpy Ho, whose business fronts were known as the Dutch 
Connection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The corrupt police-officers that were Triad members that fled anti-corruption 
drives in Hong Kong would flee to Vancouver, B.C. where they have spent their 
efforts building that area up as a large Triad base of operations. Actually, 
they have branched out into Victoria and Seattle, WA.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Triads are known to have been operating in London since the 1890s, and 
may have been operating even before that. It wasn�t until the 1960 drug culture 
that the Triads began to catch more attention due to their large involvement in 
the drug trade. In 1971, the Triads introduced Pure No. 4 her<span lang="en-gb">o</span>in 
into England to replace the �Brown Sugar� that the Rolling Stones sang about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1973, the British authorities moved against the Americans and British 
agents on the Drug Squad and forced some resignations. It is not exactly clear 
what the details of the whole mess were, but the process was that for 2 years 
there was essentially no coherent drug squad in London.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Every locality In England where ethnic Chinese are located, the Triads have 
some type of operation. This means all of the British cities. In Scotland and 
Ireland the different Triad groups have been fighting each other for control of 
the territory. No wonder the Illuminati like the Triads. The U family with their 
connections controlling the Triads, have the perfect vehicle to operate the drug 
trade. If anyone dislikes the drug trade, their hate will directed to an ethnic 
group, rather than realizing who the real kings are. Most of the couriers for 
the Triads today are Europeans. And the Trade are using British banks now more 
than the Hong Kong banks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The British Parliament had a committee in 1985 to look at the Triads. They 
reported that the Triads posed no threat to the U. K<span lang="en-gb">.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Mafia had tried to maintain its position in the drug activity, but the 
Mafia wasn�t in a position to buy directly from the prime sources. The Chiu Chau 
Triads had operated in Saigon and Vietnam during the Vietnam war bringing in 
drugs for the American soldiers. The Corsican syndicates (organized crime) had 
connections in Vietnam. They introduced the Mafia to the Triads. The Corsicans 
had been known as the French connection in the drug trade. They had worked with 
supplies coining from Turkey, through Lebanon, and then to Marseilles, France. 
Now the Triads ship Asian drugs to the U.S. via South America, and the Triads 
control the drug trade in New York City almost totally now. <span lang="en-gb">B</span>ear 
in mind that the Triad leaders did this only after working out agreements with 
the top Illuminati families. If the top Illuminati families were not 
cooperating, the Triads would be out of business.</font></p>

with all types of secret fraternal groups including the Freemasons. Historically 
speaking they have cooperated numerous times with other Chinese secret 
societies. The Triads also work with the Japanese organized crime group Yakusa, 
and the Filipino organized crime groups. The Yakusa also move drugs into the 
U.S. mainly via Hawaii. This is taking place with Yakusa/Triad cooperation. The

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Aristotle Socrates Onassis -- named after two Greek philosophers, went from 
being totally broke at age 21 to being a millionaire at age 23. His father�s 
first name was Socrates. Aristotle was an Illuminati king, a shipping tycoon, an 
intelligent ruthless hard-driving man, a man of the world who spoke a number of 
languages such as French, Spanish, English, Italian, and Turkish. He married 
JFK�s widow. His ever present sunglasses made him look like Al Capone to a 
number of people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis-Her father was a member of the Society of the 
Cincinnati, the American equivalent to the Order of the Garter. Her father &quot; 
Black Jack&quot; was corrupt, what is known as a womanizer. He worked at making a 
living from the stock market. Jackie�s &quot;step-father&quot; was the Auchincloss family, 
an elite family. Her step-father�s second wife before Jackie�s mother was 
Senator Thomas Gore�s daughter. Her step-father was in Naval Intelligence. 
Jackie went to the schools that the children of the elite go to. On the 
anniversary of JFK�s assassination, Orville &amp; Jane Freeman were the only ones to 
remember the date to say or do something about it. Jackie went that day to 
Central Park and had a good cry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Stavros Niarchos-Aristotle�s brother-in-law and Ari�s business competition. 
Stavros� parents came from Sparta, Greece. His relatives were rich. Stavros went 
into shipping and after W.W. II broke out, left Greece to avoid having to fight 
for Greece. He was a close friend of Colgate, Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch, who 
he would invite to his house on Long Island. He rented his Long island house 
from Harry Hopkins who was the man who told Pres. F.D. Roosevelt what to do. 
Even though he was a millionaire, he had a difficult time avoiding have to 
serve. Eventually, he managed to get himself situated as a naval officer in 
intelligence for Greece in Alexandria, Egypt. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Information sent Into the �69-70 Who�s Who reference book about his war time 
exploits are fictitious. Niarchos and Aristotle were friends from 1934 onward, 
but also at times enemies trying to outdo each other. Both frequently went to 
St. Moritz, Swit., a ski resort. Stavros also frequents an old Medici family 
Palace/estate near Turin where the Duke of Edinburgh and Baron Elie de 
Rothschild like to go and shoot birds. The estate has many and it isn�t unusual 
for them to kill a thousand a day. Stavros is an important leader of the 
Bilderbergers and a billionaire. He married Henry Ford II�s daughter who was 38 
years younger than he was, and divorced her shortly afterwards. He worked 
closely with David Rockefeller.</font></p>

BLOODLINE STILL POWERFUL?</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Aristotle Onassis died in 1975. His son and heir to his throne died in 1973. 
My inside information about the Onassis family being one of the top 13 goes back 
to the 1960s and 70�s. Is the family still powerful? One big clue that they 
still wield power within the Illuminati is that Stavros Niarchos, Aristotle�s 
brother-in-law, is a powerful Bilderberger. The executive committee of the 
Bilderbergers are the equivalent to 9� of the branch Illuminati. Is the Onassis 
family still one of the top 13 Satanic bloodlines? I do not know. The answer 
lies in doing genealogical work to find out what the core satanic bloodline is 
that curses through the Onassis family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One whistle-blower on the Illuminati was Dennis Brunnelle, a Grand Master of 
an OTO lodge, who became disillusioned with the OTO�s Illuminati program. Some 
of his information touches on the Onassis family. My understanding of the 
Onassis family is limited in terms of their Satanic activities with the 
Illuminati, but I will attempt to give my readers a better understanding. My 
inside knowledge of the occult side-that is the secret satanic ritual activities 
of the family is sparse, because my informants have very limited knowledge of 
the Onassis participation. However, there are certainly plenty of tracks in the 
sand which indicate who the business friends of this family have been, and they 
have been very clearly those within the Illuminati or with connections to it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="TURKEY_">TURKEY</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The area that is now known as Turkey played a major role in the Mystery 
Religions. The use of drugs to create &quot;religious&quot; experiences was developed to a 
fine art by various occult fraternal mystery religion groups in the Turkey area. 
The Assassins from where we get the word hashish controlled parts of Turkey and 
Lebanon in Medieval times. They used drugs to gain the allegiance of their 
recruits. Some of the most powerful figures for the Illuminati have been Turks. 
The Grand Orient has had some powerful figures in Turkey. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">For instance, at the Masonic Congress of all the Grand Orients� (that�s 
European Freemasonry- although several American presidents have been members of 
European Freemasonry) Grand Lodges, Bou Achmed came from Turkey. The Grand Lodge 
of Asia was represented by Sebeyck-Kadir from Asia. Bou Achmed took a big role 
in the Grand Orient�s decisions. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As a aside, let me explain one example of the power of the Grand Orient in 
America. The Grand Orient was originally strong in Louisiana but spread Itself 
to many other US. locations. <b><a name="Garfield">Garfield</a></b>, a very 
powerful man in the Grand Orient, managed to become US. President because the 
political process got deadlocked at the convention and the Masons suggested him 
as a compromise candidate. Although Garfield was an extremely powerful Mason, 
had been perhaps the youngest general in the US. army during the Civil War, the 
Illuminati ordered him shot after he had served about a year in office as 
President. Garfield was reported by an eye-witness to Satanic rituals to have 
participated in the cannibalistic rites of Satanism done to gain the spiritual 
power of the eaten person. The Grand Orient Freemasonry has been linked to other 
orders of Freemasonry that are also called Rosicrucian's. Pope John XXIII joined 
a Rosicrucian group that had links to European Freemasonry when he was in 
Turkey.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">While the secret Grand Orient Freemasonry was very strong in Turkey in spite 
of its small numbers, the regular American Freemasonry granted a dispensation 
for a Masonic Lodge to operate in Smyrna, Turkey in May, 1863 but the charters 
were withdrawn on Aug. 27, 1880. However, it is interesting that of all the 
Turkish cities, Smyrna was definitely the best place for Freemasonry to gain 
recruits. </font> </p>

Pasha family have been leaders within Freemasonry and the Illuminati. Achmed 
Pasha was a Satanist and had a large harem. </font> 
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Mehmet_Talaat_Pasha">
Mehmet Talaat Pasha</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> (1872-1921) was a Freemason and part of the Turkish 
revolution of 1908. He was the leader of the Young Turks, which was a joint 
project of the Sufis and the Frankist Satanists. (The type of Satanism led by 
the Frank family has had connections to Turkey for hundreds of years.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mehmet Talaat Pasha was the Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Turkey. He 
was held the political position in Turkey of grand vizier of Turkey (1917-18). 
Another Turkish Pasha was part of the Turkish royalty running Egypt when Egypt 
was part of the Ottoman Empire. His name was </font>
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Khedive_Ismail_Pasha">
Khedive Ismail Pasha</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> and he was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of 
Egypt. It was this Turk, Khedive Ismail Pasha, who gave the famous Obelisk to 
the United States. This Obelisk was called Cleopatra�s Needle and was originally 
erected in the city of the sun, Heliopolis, about 1500 B.C. The Obelisk is a 
representation of a human penis, because sun worship, worship of regeneration 
(sex) and worship of the sun god Satan were all tied together. Masons helped 
with the moving of the obelisk, and its dedication when it arrived in New York 
City. Large obelisks have been erected by Masons in New York, Washington D.C., 
Paris, the Vatican, and London. (If my memory serves me correct Berlin received 
one too at one time.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Every morning when the United States President wakes up he can look out the 
window and see the Masonic obelisk and be reminded of who controls America.
<span lang="en-gb">If</span> the President has any training in the Mystery 
religion of ancient Egypt, he will also know what body part is symbolically 
erected in the Washington Memorial. (If the United States were ever to return to 
serving God, that monument would be a good one to destroy. God asked the 
Israelites not just simply to avoid worshipping such abominations, He asked His 
people to destroy them, for their very creation was abomination. This touches on 
the issues raised in another article in this newsletter.)</font></p>

India Co</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">. wrested control from the Great Moguls of the Opium trade 
during the 18th and 19th century. People connected the Br. East India Co. were 
responsible for the creation of the Fabian Society. The Illuminati, already 
headquartered in London in the 19th century, allowed John Jacob Astor (see Jan. 
1, �93 newsletter about the Astor family) beginning around 1815 to operate an 
opium smuggling operation. Besides Astor�s ships picking up quicksilver and lend 
at Gibraltar, and iron/steel from northern Europe, his ships picked up opium at 
Smyrna, Turkey. The opium was then sold in China. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Onassis family was one of the top three merchant families in Smyrna. And 
Socrates Onassis until 1922 quietly ran a banking operation (or money 
laundering?) from their home which had a large amount of money left by powerful 
Turks. Could Socrates� father been part of a secret Illuminati opium connection, 
which had begun back about 1815 with the Astor family in Smyrna, Turkey? We know 
for certain that he had powerful British, Italian, and Turkish friends before he 
was arrested in 1922, and that these friends saved his life from a death 
sentence. About 1925-26, his son Aristotle Onassis, who was from Smyrna, Turkey 
began secretly importing opium into Argentina from Turkey, under the cover and 
disguise of importing tobacco. </font> </p>

established two secret lodges at Salonika, Turkey around the early 20th century. 
The dialect of the Jews in that area is often mistakenly called �crude Spanish.&quot; 
Actually the language is Latino a Judeo-Spanish dialect spoken in Constantinople 
and Smyrna. A western Ladino is spoken in Salonika*), Bosnia, and Serbia. 
Masonic Jews speaking this Latino language were part of the Masonic plot that 
started World War I. Numerous high level Masons were informed of the coming 
assassination of the Archduke which a thinking person could realize what and 
contradiction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Actually, I would state it slightly different. His life is shrouded in 
smokescreens. However, there are records, documents, witnesses, etc. and it is 
possible to reconstruct many details about his life. I will attempt to 
reconstruct some of the details of that life as they pertain to his secret life 
as an Illuminati leader. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Illuminati is divided into the drug/porn section, the political/business 
management section, and the cult ritual section, global communications section, 
and mind-control section. The leadership within the various areas overlap. The 
drug/porn/political areas work together as a unit. The mind-control area seems 
to be somewhat technical and somewhat separate. Further, several groups have 
been identified as assigned the job of keeping the long range plans. The three 
groups that have been entrusted with long range plans are the Order of the 
Garter, Order of the Quest, &amp; Keepers of the Dawn. The plans to bring in the New 
World Order are very detailed, and their management and safekeeping have not 
been haphazard. Aristotle worked within the drug/porn/political/business 
management area Aristotle�s power was so pervasive that some researchers of his 
activities concluded that he was absolutely the most powerful man on earth. This 
is because they were not aware of the shared power of the Illuminati &quot;kings&quot;. 
Aristotle did have world-wide power, but that appearance of power was there 
because he was part of Moriah (the Satanic hierarchy which controls the world.)
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Aristotle Onassis� family has bad their misfortunes too. All of the top 
families are in competition, and although they work together they also fight 
together. Even within Aristotle�s own family, a stiff long time rivalry with his 
brother-in-law made life difficult for everyone associated with Aristotle. And 
yet for all their competition, Aristotle invited Stavros Niarchos to spend time 
on his yacht, which Jacqueline his wife detested immensely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">*)&nbsp;Correction. Greek is spoken in Salonika, not Ladino. Salonika is a Greek 
city (editor's note)</font></p>

LEAVES GREECE &amp; GOES TO ARGENTINA</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Aristotle�s father had planned to send him to Oxford, but the Turkish 
genocide of the Greek Turks changed his plans. Aristotle instead set out from 
Greece to Argentina. Supposedly, Aristotle landed in Argentina stateless and 
broke. From what I can make out it appears to be true, although it is possible 
he had some contacts to help the move to a foreign country. It is said that he 
finally found a job as a dishwasher in a bar on the corner of Corrientes &amp; 
Talcahuano in Buenos Alres. Near the end of 1924, he was able to obtain a job 
later on with the British United River Plate Telephone Co. (Argentina was at 
times called the fifth British Dominion because the British Rothschild's and 
other British investors owned so much of Argentina.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In the next few years, Aristotle proved himself a very capable manager and 
with great potential as an underworld leader. Juan Gaoana, the boss of a leading 
Argentine cigarette manufacturing company was the first to put in an order 
through Aristotle to get tobacco from Turkey via Ari�s father in Greece. This 
tobacco importing was the cover for Adi�s opium running. After two years, 
Onassis went into manufacturing cigarettes. Again this was a cover, but Onassis 
was out to prove himself in anyway he could, so he illegally borrowed the name 
of a famous Argentine brand of cigarettes called BIS, and labeled his cigarettes 
the same thing. The owner of BIS sued Onassis for using his company�s name and 
won in court. The cigarette manufacturing was clearly a losing deal, and Onassis 
got out of it. However, the biographies credit his cigarette manufacturing as 
bringing in his wealth, while at the same time acknowledging that he was losing 
money from them and had to dump them because they were unprofitable. Which is 
it? </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As I stated, Aristotle was running drugs into Argentina. Aristotle states 
that he was penniless when he arrived in Argentina at age 21, and that he had 
made his first million dollars by age 23. Long story short-the facts as to where 
he lived, what witnesses say etc. appear to collaborate that he went from having 
nothing to being wealthy within those two years. His lifestyle changed 
dramatically. People blame his riches on the fact that he worked long hours. (I 
know many people who work long hours and are creative and people just don�t move 
up the ladder that fast by working for a phone company and selling tobacco.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Aristotle Onassis associated with many powerful people. The fact that he 
rubbed shoulders with establishment figures that tie back to the elite is 
nothing surprising of a person his wealth. However, it is the nature of his 
involvement with other Illuminati figures that reveals his position within 
Moriah. Before going into his Illuminati business ventures, let�s just discuss 
some of his friendships. An example of his visits to friends is this quote from 
the book Onassis. �The Christina�s cruises always produced items which no alert 
gossip columnist could miss. Onassis dropping in on Prince Alfonso Hoheiohe�s 
Marbella Club in southern Spain and lunching with Baron and Baroness Guy de 
Rothschild (amidst rumors that it was Rothschild money that had supplanted his 
own in Monte Carlo) was obviously a noteworthy social incident.� (Onassis, p. 
255) During W.W. II, Onassis was a regular guest of the movie mogul Spyros 
Skouras at Mamaroneck on Long Island. Other close friends of Onassis were the

up a dictatorship in Argentina<span lang="en-gb">.</span></a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Perons have a great number of Nazi &amp; Satanic connections/activities. If 
you get <span lang="en-gb">i</span>nto studying about the Perons you will come 
up with names such as </font> <font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Josef_Mengele">Josef Mengele</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> (a 
Satanic Nazi Doctor), </font> <font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Dr._Fritz_Thyssen,_and_Otto_Skorzeny">Dr. 
Fritz Thyssen, and Otto Skorzeny</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">. Onassis had sexual liaisons with Evita 
Peron, who was a platinum blonde. Onassis had Nazi connections that continued 
his whole life, as did the Perons. For instance, one of Onassis�s Nazi 
associates was </font> <font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Hjalmar_Schacht">Hjalmar Schacht</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">, president 
of Hitler�s Reichbank, who Onassis hired after the war. Schacht helped Onassis� 
shipyards in Germany build tankers after W.W. II. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Until people realize that the real guiding hand behind the Nazi�s was 
Satanism they will continue to be misguided as to the way everything connects 
together at the top. For instance, John Foster Dulles was the man at Versailles 
Treaty who can be credited for having created the Treaty�s harsh terms against 
Germany that ruined Germany financially after W.W. II. And yet this same man, 
John Foster Dulles, was the person who secretly went to Hitler to confirm to 
Hitler that the elite would financially back Hitler�s rise to power. If Hitler 
were anything like our image of him, Hider would have rung his neck, here before 
him was the man who made Germany suffer. why was Hitler friendly with this man? 
It makes no sense, unless people wake up to what is going on. The answer is that 
there is a conspiracy of those who are at the top to rule us, and to guide us 
toward a New World Order, and they are quite willing to sacrifice whole nations 
to do that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Onassis was an extremely close friend of 
</font>
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Winston_Churchill">
Winston Churchill</a></b>.</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> The Freemason Winston Churchill is a descendent of a 
family that has been part of the elite that have secretly run the world. Winston 
Churchill on several occasions told Onassis that the only one he could trust in 
W.W. II was Joseph Stalin. (This is a far cry from the picture given in history 
books.) Winston Churchill spent a great deal of time on Onassis�s yacht 
Christina. Onassis was also friendly with Winston Churchill�s friend of Bernard 
Baruch. It was <b><a name="Bernard_Baruch">Bernard Baruch</a></b> who convinced 
Winston Churchill to join the Illuminati conspiracy. He asked Churchill to come 
watch something important in NY in 1929, and then he showed Churchill how they 
could destroy the Stock Market. That show of power brought Churchill on board.

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Two other Illuminati friends of Ari Onassis were <b>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1928, the Illuminati men who controlled the major oil companies got

the world into an international cartel. This is why you may have watched the 
same gas truck bring gas to all the different gas stations in an area, for 
instance, say a Sinclair station, a BP station (Rothschild's), and an Exxon 
station (Rockefeller). If the reader understands the world�s oil was totally in 
an Illuminati monopoly by 1928, it will help you understand that Aristotle who 
was the man who built the largest oil tanker ships was also Illuminati. In one 
year alone during the 1950s, Onassis bought 17 new tankers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="EVIDENCE_OF_THE_CONSPIRACY_">EVIDENCE OF THE CONSPIRACY</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the most telling paper trail signs that the conspiracy has left behind 
was an executive order that FDR signed just after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. 
This executive order was a semi-secret amendment to </font> 
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b>
<a name="Trading_With_The_Enemy_Act">Trading With The Enemy Act</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> which 
made it LEGAL to trade with the enemy if the Sec. of the Treasury (then Hans 
Morganthau) gave permission. Morganthau was a tool of the conspiracy, and of 
course he gave permission to the top Illuminati to trade with the enemy. (In 
1983, a book came out Trading With The Enemy which exposes how the elite 
secretly kept Hitler going by supplying him, rebuilding his communications etc. 
Onassis as an Illuminati king worked with other elites Rockefeller, Kennedy, 
Getty to quietly make a profit and keep the war going longer. Onassis sold oil 
and guns to both sides. ITT telephones were used in German submarines. [This 
Executive Order shows that at the top their is a conspiracy--it is reproduced on 
the following pages.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There were 450 merchant ships owned by Greeks before W.W. II. Out of those 
Aristotle said 410 were sunk during the war. The official count was 360. Either 
way it is clear that most of the Greek shippers lost their large merchant ships. 
However, the German submarines and aircraft never once touched Aristotle's� 
ships although they sailed through war zones. Neither did the Allies. Aristotle 
alone did not suffer any losses. Aristotle�s large fleet did not lose a single 
ship even the ones that were in Scandinavia when the Germans invaded. Only the 
full collaboration at the highest levels could have pulled that one off.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="HOWARD_HUGHS_">HOWARD HUGHS</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Howard Hughs was a self-made millionaire and genius. Howard Hughs was not 
part of the system, so he was fair game to destroy. Even millionaires like Hughs 
and the Hunt brothers have to toe the line, or they can be taken out by the 
Illuminati. This doesn�t mean Howard Hughs was virtuous. Howard Hughs gave 
Nixon�s brother Donald a quarter million dollar &quot;loan&quot; (gift) in 1956 in order 
to continue having vice-pres. Nixon in his pocket. Hughs had been a supporter of 
Nixon for many years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Onassis infiltrated his own men into Hugh�s organization. Chester Davis was 
from Sicily, and although he worked for Hughs, took orders from Onassis. In 
1955, Hughs had obtained two doubles, one named L. Wayne Rector and the other 
Brooks Randie. In March, 1957 Onassis� men at the Beverly Hills Hotel captured 
Howard Hughs using Hughs� own disloyal men. Hughs was seriously hurt in the 
kidnapping. I believe at this point he was taken to Emerald Isle Hotel in the 
Bahamas. (Some of the people who are aware that Onassis captured Hughs, dispute 
that Hughs was taken out of the country.) The top floor was rented for the 
&quot;Hughes Party&quot;. For a month the captive Hughs was shot full of heroin, and then 
secretly transported to a cell on Onassis� private island of Skorpios. Hughs two 
doubles stayed on under the pay of Onassis. One became Hughs, and the other 
became Hughs� double. Computer programs which can duplicate signatures were used 
to provide Hugh�s signature. The computer and its program used for duplicating 
Hughs� signature even became public knowledge when the Los Angeles Times had an 
article on 1/28/71 about a computer which had been programmed to write the 
signature of Hughes. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Mormon Mafia that supposedly guarded Hughs actually ran the Hughs empire 
for Illuminatus Onassis, which accounts for the change in policies that were 
made by Hughs empire. It also explains why they bought up every newsreel they 
could find on Hughes in order to duplicate voice-prints using computers. When 
they were through with the double L. Wayne Rector he was shot at Rothschild�s 
Inn on the Park, in London.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Joseph_Kennedy">Joseph Kennedy</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> 
in September, 1957, the decision was taken to use the Mafia�s power to get John 
F. Kennedy elected. The Mafia was caught in Chicago tampering big time with the 
voting--but Nixon was denied a recount of the votes. Nixon backed off from 
making a fuss, because he was promised the chance to be President later. 
Illinois Republicans made an unofficial recount of 699 paper ballot precincts in 
Cook County and came up with the vote in favor of Nixon. Those votes would have 
changed Illinois�s electoral votes and thrown the victory to Nixon. However, Sam 
Giancana and his henchman Mayor Richard Daley were not about to let an official 
recount take place. In 1961, Joseph Kennedy had a stroke, and John Kennedy and 
Robert feeling their freedom, and disliking some of the powerful Illuminati like 
Aristotle Onassis, decided to use their popularity to destroy the conspiracy. I 
believe Kennedy and Robert had more courage to take on the conspiracy, due to 
the fact that they were familiar with it from having been (in a sense) on the 
inside of it during their days growing up. However, neither son had received the 
Illuminati training and indoctrination that their older brother had, and when be 
died.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Joseph made a mistake when he decided to replace Joe, Jr. with John (who they 
called Jack). The mistake was that John F. Kennedy may have seemed like he�d be 
a good Illuminati President, but he actually thought for himself. He thought for 
himself because he was young and with that impetuousness and vigor of youth, and 
with the popularity he had, he had the possibility to do some good for this 
nation. If I were state my evaluation, it would be to tell conservatives that 
they have been &quot;hoodwinked&quot;. John F. Kennedy did more conservative (preserving 
this nation) things in his Presidency than Nixon and Reagan who are heralded as 
conservative. Kennedy didn�t recognize Red China, no-- that was Nixon. Kennedy 
didn�t triple the national debt, no, that was Reagan. The CIA has been out to 
get JFK, ever since they realized JFK didn�t view himself as their puppet, but 
that he viewed himself as their boss. The head of the CIA on purpose ruined the 
CIA�s chances to succeed at the Bay of Pigs. He personally prevented the CIA air 
cover from taking off, which the CIA knew that without air support, the 
operation had no chance, which was soon proved correct. in everyone�s zeal to 
get JFK they blamed JFK.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It all sounded so believable, because the CIA were going to tell the full 
story. The public is not astute enough to realize that the press had subtly 
turned against Kennedy. Two powerful friends who liked John F. Kennedy and 
wanted to help JFK fight the elite were taken out before Kennedy was 
assassinated. </font><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Senator_Estes_Kefauver">Senator Estes Kefauver</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">, 
whose Crime Commission had discovered the 1932 deal that Onassis, Kennedy, 
Meyer, Roosevelt, Lansky and other Illuminati--Mafia figures had made. Kefauver 
was poisoned so that he had a secret poison induced &quot;heart attack&quot; on Aug. 8, 
1963. One suspect that might have done it was his subordinate Bernard 
Fensterwald, who was also a CIA assassin. The other was Phillip Graham. His wife </font>

<b><a name="Katherine_MEYER_Graham">Katherine MEYER Graham</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> has been a 
full participant of the conspiracy and shows up repeatedly in elite activities. 
Katherine bribed some psychiatrists to certify her husband who was editor of the 
Washington Post was insane. He was ordered by a judge into a mental hospital. 
When he was allowed to visit home on a weekend, he was found &quot;suicided&quot; by a 
shotgun. Bobby Kennedy had a good idea who shot his brother. He wrote an 
unpublished book called The Enemy Within, and then later he was assassinated 
too. Actually, the whole establishment were out to get Kennedy, and even George 
Bush was involved with the assassination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The key to understanding the Illuminati is that it is headquartered in the 
London area. The Satanists (and witches) refer to Great Britain as the mother 
country<span lang="en-gb">. </span>&nbsp;Onassis had the best connections anyone 
could want in the British Government, as would be expected of someone of his 
standing in the Illuminati. He had many British friends, just one example is Sir 
Lionel Heald, the Br. Attorney General. He attended the exclusive Br. Other 
Club. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When W.W. II broke out on Sept. 3, �39, Onassis was living in Savoy Hotel 
where the headquarters for the Illuminati�s Pilgrim Society are. The British 
London Times backed Onassis in his dispute with Peru over whaling. Onassis did 
finally get himself into trouble with illegal whaling when the nation of Norway 
gathered the evidence of his <span lang="en-gb">c</span>ulling of hundreds of 
whales that were illegal to hunt. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Just two more quick examples of his social connections in Britain are his 
attendance at J.Paul Getty�s party at Sutton Place, Eng. in the �50s, and 
Onassis� own big party for the elite on 17 June �58 at Dorchester, England. As 
explained in Be Wise As Serpents, Britain�s overseas intelligence MI-6 is the 
Illuminati�s chief intelligence agency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There is no way of knowing how many meetings took place dealing with the 
planning of the assassination of Kennedy. The first were high level Illuminati 
meetings. But the Illuminati meetings were not operational level meetings. There 
were several levels of meetings. Next, a series of meetings by British 
Intelligence at Tryall Compound at Montego Bay, Jamaica, and Mafia meetings at 
who knows where. A minor trading company called </font>
<font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"> <b><a name="Permindex_">
Permindex</a></b></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> was the cover to an assassination bureau that had its major 
U.S. subsidiary the International Trade Mart in New Orleans. The FBI�s Division 
5 was tied in with Permindex, and Permindex�s board of directors had U.N. posts, 
Mafia positions, European banking ties, Nazi ties, etc. In other words Permindex 
was well connected. By the time the planning was done, it included certain 
elements of the CIA and Freemasons. A Major Lauis Mortimer Bloomfield, 
Permindex�s Pres. &amp; Chairman, a key player in Hoover�s Division 5, and a member 
of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (the Protestant branch of the Knights of 
Malta) was a homosexual lover of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. All the board of 
Permindex and many of its various subsidiaries were in various areas in 
November, 1963 carrying out the assassination and coverup.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of the covers for the Permindex operators/teams was to pose as 
missionaries of the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC). The whole 
reason the elite set up the extensive ACCC was to have a cover for their killing 
units. For instance, a group of about 30 of the best marksmen were undercover as 
part of ACCC missionary school in Puebla, Mexico, The Tolstoy Foundation (who I 
have visited with<span lang="en-gb">)</span> were another pseudo &quot;Christian&quot; 
front. Later, the headquarters of this assassination group was shifted to 
Paradise Island, Grand Bahamas to Intertel. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Ian Fleming's novels write about a Third Force used to create a world 
government that was based in the resort islands of the Caribbean. How true that 
has become. In the Westerns put out by Hollywood, when the bad guy does 
something to the good guy, he runs off with his woman. That is what happened 
with JFK. Onassis was one of the Illuminati kings who decided JFK must go, and 
he got to run off with the dead man�s wife. Onassis had already gotten <b>
<a name="Jackie_">Jackie</a></b> onto his yacht, sexually, prior to Kennedy�s 
assassination. Franklin Roosevelt, Jr. was on board together with Aristotle and 
Jackie. Jackie didn�t enjoy her marriage to Onassis. At one point in their 
marriage when they were swimming nude at Onassis� island Skorpios, ten 
photographers with underwater cameras and telephoto lens captured Jackie naked 
and her picture was splashed across Playmen and Hustler, etc. Jackie was furious 
and wanted her husband to sue the newspapers and magazines, which he refused to 
do<span lang="en-gb">. </span>&nbsp;A year before Aristotle died he actually admitted 
that he had planned the whole operation. The date given for the actual Howard 
Hugh�s death, who had been kept prisoner under horrendous conditions by Onassis, 
was Apr. 18, 1971. In the previous year 1970, Hugh�s purported autobiography had 
come out written by Clifford Irving. Clifford Irving�s wife took the publisher�s 
check made out to Howard Hugh�s to one of Onassis�s Swiss banks, and was paid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Tina divorced Ari and then went on to soon marry a relative of Winston

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Reynold�s family is not one of the 13 primary bloodlines, but they are 
such a prominent Illuminati family within the 13 bloodlines that I have decided 
to single them out for another article on Illumanati bloodlines. Although the 
Reynolds are allied with many of the major Satanic bloodlines, including the 
Rothschilds, the DuPonts, the Rockefellers, the Graces and the Grays, they are 
especially close and intertwined to the Duke and Cullman families. (One example 
of a Duke/Reynold joint project is the Research Triangle Foundation.) It should 
be remembered that The Temporary National Economic Committee of Congress in 1937 
which studied the super rich found that the Dukes and the Reynolds were among 
the top 13 wealthiest families in America. Further, my research at one place or 
another has shown that the Reynolds of the Illuminati variety have interacted 
with all of the other major Satanic bloodlines. These elite birds of a feather 
all flock together.</font></p>

repeated opportunities to include various members of the Reynold�s bloodline in 
my exposes. It must always be borne in mind that a large share of each of these 
bloodlines are hidden behind other last names.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Within this area, my newsletter has exposed Reynold family members of the 
Illuminati from Astoria, Oregon (such as Scottish Rite Librarian/Mortician 
Reynolds) and Bend, Oregon (such as Mayor Paul Reynolds who also runs a 
mortuary, and his son Mark). One of the first Illuminati Monarch slaves in the 
Portland area to seek her freedom was Mary D. Reynolds. She was from the Mother 
of Darkness level. She wanted to find treatment for the programming that goes 
with the Mother of Darkness level, and since wanting her freedom it is anybody�s 
guess what happened to her.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Some of the Reynolds family have written occult books. I don�t know how all 
the people mentioned in this section are related, but some or all of these 
people may relate to the Satanic Reynold�s bloodline. One of the important 
ecumenical Christian leaders is Frank E. Reynolds who is an American Baptist 
Minister (ordained 1955, Program dir. Student Christian Ctr. Bangkok, Thailand, 
Minister for Chicago Ecumenical Ministries �61-�64.) Frank E. Reynolds has been 
trying to introduce Buddhism to America. He and his wife Mani have written a 
number of books to introduce and teach Buddhism to Americans. Many of the 
Reynolds have been Episcopalians. Remember the Episcopalian Church is run by 
Freemasons and is thoroughly sold out to the occult. One of my Monarch survivors 
vividly recalls a human sacrifice done at the altar of an Episcopalian church. 
Anyway, getting back to the names of some Reynolds who have written occult 
books, here is a list of some:</font></p>

FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF THE REYNOLDS</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Before we get into the nitty-gritty let�s take a quick overview of the 
Reynold�s financial interests. Much of the family�s money has been well-hidden 
behind fronts, holding companies, etc. The Satanists of the Reynolds family have 
been involved in high level drug dealing during this century. They have also had 
some important and major interests in Banking, Tobacco, and Aluminium, it seems 
like a fair number have gotten into the mortuary/cremation business, which is a 
great assistance for cremation after rituals involving human sacrifice. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The financial interests of the Reynolds seem to be strongest in the Middle 
South, and strong in both Virginia and North Carolina. The Reynold�s financial 
interests are so tightly woven in with the Cu<span lang="en-gb">l</span>lmans 
and Dukes that I will have to deal with all three families together. A few years 
ago the financial heads of the three families were as follows: Angier Biddle 
Duke, Richard S. Reynolds, Jr., and Joseph F. Cullman, 3rd. All were members of 
the Pilgrim Society. It is possible that the family also has so<span lang="en-gb">me</span> 
type of secret spiritual hierarchy too. If so, it might follow along the lines 
of the top 13 families which have kings and princes, and princesses, etc. of 
their bloodlines. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Richard S. Reynolds, Jr. has been a board chairman of Robertshaw Controls 
Company, which has a stranglehold monopoly on manufacturing car thermostats and 
other car parts. The big three American auto manufacturers all buy from 
Robertshaw Controls Company; but then since all 3 of the American auto 
manufacturers are Illuminati controlled, they likely don�t care that the 
Reynolds family has such a stranglehold on them. Cadence which own theatres and 
has published occult comic books like the series, &quot;Journey into Mystery With The 
Mighty Thor&quot; is also tied to the Reynolds family. Cadence promotes the occult 
while making money. What American doesn�t know what �Reynold�s wrap&quot; is. The 
Reynold�s name is a well-know household name just like DuPont paints, or the 
Rockefeller Center, or the Waldorf Astoria are well known American items named 
after Illuminati families. The Reynolds family controls several Aluminum 
companies which form a large part of the Illuminati-controlled Aluminum cartel. 
The Mellon family works with the Reynolds in this Aluminum cartel, and various 
Illuminati families also have their hands in the management of the Aluminum 
industry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="THE_TOBACCO-DRUG_CONNECTION_">THE TOBACCO-DRUG CONNECTION</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Reynolds family is behind the RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. C. Boyden Gray of 
the Satanic Grey/Gray family is heir to the RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. But don�t 
let that sidetrack you, the Reynolds family still has financial interests and 
power in the company. If readers remember previous articles on top 13 Illuminati 
families--specifically, the Astor family article, the Onassis family article and 
the Li family article you will remember some details that will help you 
understand the secret illegal drug trade that the Reynold�s got involved in. The 
British elite got involved in shipping opium. The elite families got monopolies 
on the opium trade. The British empire�s military might and political clout was 
used to force China to allow the opium trade<span lang="en-gb">.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Before the communists took over China, the British Illuminati families hid 
their opium trade behind the cover of the British American Tobacco Co. Later the 
Red Chinese would hide their opium trading behind the same front tobacco, with 
their state-run People�s Republic of China Tobacco Bureau. In fact, the Red 
Chinese opium trade was controlled by another Illuminatus, the P.R. President Li 
Xiannian. Li Xiannian is from the occult U family who are proud that they are 
the leading oriental Satanic family. President Li, a drug lord was finance 
minister of Red China from �57-�75. He sold so much opium to the west that he 
was able to help Red China pay off her debts, and he was nicknamed �the money 
god.� </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">RJ. Reynolds was a partner with British American Tobacco Co. and was also 
involved in trading in opium for many years. R.J. Reynolds was also involved 
with the rigidly controlled tobacco industry. I have reasons to suspect that the 
family later got involved with running cocaine. Onassis also hid his early drug 
smuggling behind tobacco importing. The Dukes controlled Liggett &amp; Nlyers 
Tobacco via their Duke Endowment, a family foundation. The Cullman's are known 
for their Miller Brewing Company. The Cullman fortune was also originally 
derived via a tobacco company. The Duke family via underhanded tactics put 
together a monopoly of the tobacco industry called the American Tobacco Company. 
Later they merged and bought out 88 tobacco companies, and the capitalization of 
the company was $235 million prior to 1911. The Supreme Court made the American 
Tobacco Company dissolve since it had created an illegal monopoly. However, the 
Dukes rearranged things and kept on going. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Dukes inte<span lang="en-gb">r</span>ma<span lang="en-gb">rri</span>ed 
with the Biddies who worked with the Rothschilds. The Dukes also intermarried 
with the Drexels, who in turn intermarried with the Harrimans and Goulds. 
Nicholas Biddle (1879-1923) was a trustee of the Illuminatus William Astor of 
the top 13 Illuminati family of Astors. Some of the Biddies intermarried with 
the Astors Illuminati family too! It�s a small world at the top. Researcher 
Ferdinand Lundberg in his book America�s 60 Families states on p. 36, &quot;The 
Morgan firm and its affiliated commercial banks act, broadly, on behalf of such 
tremendous accumulations as those of the Vanderbilts, Goulds, Drexels, Wideners, 
Berwinds, Phippses, Hills, Dukes, Ryans, McCormicks, Bakers, DuPonts, Fishers, 
Jameses, and Others.� Isn�t it interesting that my writings have exposed the 
Morgans, Vanderbilts, Goulds, Drexels, Phippses, Dukes, Bakers, DuPonts as 
families with members in the Illuminati?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Dukes and Reynolds use tax-free foundations as a vehicle to escape taxes 
and hid their wealth while maintaining their financial power. Other Illuminati 
families also used the foundations as a scheme to remain powerful and to resist 
paying taxes. The controlled press builds them up as charitable, when most of 
the grants by these foundations are self-serving for the benefit of the elite.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Some of these foundations are the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation (est. �36 in 
North Carolina), the Kate B. Reynolds Foundation (est. �46 in North Carolina), 
the Richard S. Reynolds Foundation (est. �55 in Virginia), and the Mary Reynolds 
Babcock Foundation, and the Duke Endowment (address at Rockefeller Plaza, NY). 
All of these foundations work for the Illuminati. The Donald W. Reynolds 
Foundation (est. �54 in Nevada and then moved to Arkansas) might also be 
connected to the elite--but I don�t know. The Kate B. Reynolds Health Care Trust 
provides another example of a liaison between the Duke and Reynolds families. 
John A. McMahon, a Duke University grad, served as BOTH chairman of the board of 
trustees of Duke University and since 1971 as a member of the advisory board to 
the Kate B. Reynolds Health Care Trust. Here is an example of a single man 
working for the interests of both the Dukes and Reynolds. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Edwin C. Whitehead, chairman of Technicon Corp. serves as a similar example 
of a man working for both Duke and Rockefeller interests. Whitehead is a trustee 
of both Duke University and Rockefeller University. He also has been in charge 
of several NWO organizations promoting a one-world, for instance he was Governor 
of the U.N. Association. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This article will now show you the reader some of the grants that these 
foundations make. I ask you, &quot;Do you see any possibility for any mischief behind 
these grants?! What I noticed about the Reynolds grants is that they control all 
the crisis centers in the North Carolina area via their money. This means any 
survivor of SRA calling a hot line is going to get tapped into the Illuminati�s 
net for catching escapees! I also noticed that all the colleges and universities 
got money, and a variety of different denominations incl. the Baptists, the 
Methodists, the Non-denominationalists, the Presbyterians, and the 
Ecumenicalists. What surprised me was that a number of government agencies get 
money from the Reynold Foundations, especially those dealing with children like 
Social Services, and even Police Departments get money from the Reynolds 
Foundations.</font></p>

agencies, especially the ones that the Illuminati would want to make sure they 
controlled are well supported financially. People who live in the Carolinas &amp; 
Virginia report that the corruption in those states in absolute. These 
statistics give some facts behind those statements. One organization receiving 
money above deserves exposure. The Drug Abuse Council (Council on Drug Abuse)

of over $6 billion and 37,000 employees. I have the 1976 profit figure for the 
company was $353 million. I don�t know what the current figures are. The public 
thinks that the shares are widely held by the public, while in reality the

bank holding company of North Carolina National Bank. The NCNB, which at one 
time had assets of $4.647 billion (it may be more now) has been the largest of 
the Middle South banks and is a key component of the Reynold/Duke/Cuilman

the House Ways &amp; Means Committee so that he could illegally profit a half 
million dollars for being the middle man of the transaction of the U.S. paying 
off its debt to Mexico for lands taken during the Mexican War. (See Reports of 
Committees, Thirty-third Congress, First Session, Volume iii, # 354:4.) The U.S. 
did not need a middle man to pay off Mexico, but due to corruption in Congress, 
Corcoran was able to make a bundle of money with no effort. Riggs Bank is 
associated with the Corcoran fortune. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">CFR &amp; Yale Grad &amp; Pilgrim Soc. member William McChesney Martin, Jr. has 
worked for Riggs National Bank as their advisor. The multitude of connections of 
people serving the Reynolds to the elite are mind-boggling. Many of the 
institutions in the Middle South connect back to the Illuminati and their front 
organizations such as the Freemasons and the Chambers of Commerce, the CFR etc. 
etc. Some of the companies that R.J. Reynolds Industries interlocks with are

Metals Company interlocks with is the Bank of Virginia. The Bank of Virginia in 
turn interlocks with a long list of companies. A large share of these companies 
have directors that tie back to the elite. Some of these corporations have 
directors who are members of the Pilgrim Society, others are with other 
Illuminati organizations. If the entire set of interlocks and there directors 
were exposed it might have an emotional impact on the reader, but it gets

from around 500 very powerful families worldwide. This article will not attempt 
to explain their networks and the many organizations of the Illuminati. It will 
not even try to do this for the Rockefellers. In fact, no one knows how many 
trusts and foundations the Rockefellers have. They have hidden trusts within 
secret trusts within secret trusts. It is estimated that they have between 200 
and several thousand trusts and foundations. The finances of the Rockefellers 
are so well covered that Nelson Rockefeller did not pay one cent in income taxes 
in 1970, yet he was perhaps the richest man in the U.S. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">The Rockefellers exert enormous influence over religion in this nation in the 
following ways:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">1. They provide a large share of the money that Seminaries in the United<span lang="en-gb">
</span>States need to operate.<br>
2. They provide a large share of the money that universities need to operate. 
Education influences the religious values of our people.<br>
3. They provide large grants to various religious organizations.<br>
4. Their influence and control helps determine who will get publicity in the 
major news magazines, and on television.<br>
5. Their influence has contributed to various anti-Christian organizations being 
set up.<br>
6. They directly help control certain religious groups such as Lucis Trust.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">The Rockefeller�s influence is both subtle and not so subtle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In the book The Unholy Alliance details are given on how the seminaries, 
church boards and Christian colleges have been captured. Much of the money for 
this came from the Rockefellers. One of the principle large Foundations that was 
instrumental in controlling religious institutions of various kinds was the 
Sealantic Fund. (They have now shifted to other channels.) This Foundation which 
was incorporated in 1938 and was headquartered in New York City (50 West 50th 
St.) gave enormous sums of money to manipulate Protestant concerns. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1964, according to the Russell Sage Foundation�s book The Foundation 
Directoy the Sealantic Fund gave away $681, 886 in grants.</font><a href="#*"><font color="#FFFFFF">*</font></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">In 1969, the Fund gave $1,889,550 in grants.</font><a href="#**_"><font color="#FFFFFF">**</font></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">By 1984, the Sealantic Fund was not being used. But a look at another 
Rockefeller non-profit untaxed Foundation the Rockefeller Brother�s Fund shows a 
revealing grant pattern. Many people would not be able make any sense out of 
what seems a random pattern of grants without the broad picture of what the 
Illuminati is doing today. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">My book Be Wise As Serpents should have clarified how those various groups 
who receive grants are related and helpful to the Rockefeller agenda. Although 
these other Rockefeller Foundations are not specifically geared toward religion 
such as the Sealantic Fund was, it is clear these other Foundations still impact 
religion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1952, Congressman Eugene E. Cox headed up a committee that for the first 
time tried to uncover the Rockefeller�s (and other�s) foundations� activities. 
For some reason, Cox encountered stiff opposition everywhere against his 
committee�s investigation, and the Congressman for some reason got sick and 
died. One member of the committee, Congressman Carroll Reese, and his Counsel 
Rene Wormser attempted to continue the investigation. Rockefeller�s henchmen and 
newspapers did their best to destroy Congressman Reese. The Reese investigation 
was given only the barest minimum of time and little resources for their 
investigation. However, they were still able to uncover that beginning in the 
1930s vast sums of money were spent in Education by the Rockefeller and Carnegie 
foundations. This money went to promote John Dewey, Marxism, a 
One-World-Government agenda, and Socialism. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">The foundations (principally the Rockefeller and Carnegie) stimulated 
two-thirds of the total endowment funding of all institutions of higher learning 
in America during the first third of this 20th century.</font><a href="#*******"><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">*******</font></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The NEA (National Education Association was largely financed by the 
Rockefeller/Carnegie foundations. A 1934 NEA report advised, �A dying 
laissez-faire must be completely destroyed and all of us, including the 
�owners�, must be subjected to a large degree of social control.� Reece 
Committee Counsel Rene Wormser wrote of the investigation, �...leads one to the 
conclusion that there was, indeed, something in the nature of an actual 
conspiracy among certain leading educators in the United States to bring about 
socialism through the use of our school systems...� </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">They discovered that the Rockefeller foundation was the primary culprit 
behind the teaching of socialism in America�s schools and universities and also 
behind the NEA�s policies. Rene Wormser, Counsel for the Reece Committee 
reported, �A very powerful complex of foundations and allied organizations has 
developed over the years to exercise a high degree of control over education. 
Part of this complex, and ultimately responsible for it, are the Rockefeller and 
Carnegie groups of foundations.�</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This was the situation in the 1950s when the Reece Committee briefly 
investigated. The Rockefeller-Carnegie groups have continued basically unopposed 
for the next 40 years in controlling education. One of the educational book 
producers is Grolier, Inc. Avery Rockefeller, Jr. sits on Grolier, Inc. board 
meetings. Another interesting board member is Theodore Wailer who is the 
director of Grolier, Inc. He was a member of the International Book Committee of 
UNESCO. The Rockefellers maintain great influence in the United Nations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">On Jan. 31, 1945, John D. Rockefeller addressed the Protestant Council of the 
City of N.Y. and told them that the answer to the problems Christianity was that 
Christianity needed to become �the Church of the Living God.� Many listening 
that day, may not have realized that he and other top Illuminati consider 
themselves gods, and that the solution John D. was cryptically giving was for 
Christianity to serve him a living god. (Rockefeller, John D. The Christian 
Church- What of its Future? NY:<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Protestant Council, 
1945, &amp; 1917.)</font></p>

4. Their influence and control helps determine who will get publicity in the 
major news magazines.</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rockefeller family has enormous controls over various magazines and 
newspapers. Let us examine how the power of the press can be used in religion. 
One of the magazines that the Rockefellers have some control over is Time 
magazine. Time�s board chairman, Andrew Heiskell was associated with David 
Rockefeller. Another Illuminatus of the 6th level1 Henry J. Fisher, ran McCall�s 
Magazine from 1917 to 1956. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The establishment�s media boosted Anton LaVey�s Church of Satan into 
prominence. The Jan. 31, 1967 New York Daily News ran a story about Anton LaVey 
performing the first Satanic wedding ceremony in America. The March 1970 issue 
of McCall�s ran a nice story about the Church of Satan. Not only is LaVey�s 
Church of Satan a publicity stunt to make Satanism more popular and to deflect 
criticism of real covert Satanism, the McCall issue makes Anton LaVey�s church 
sound even better in the article than it is. (For those brainwashed folks who 
think that this free advertising for Anton LaVey was just for the sake of 
finding a good story for the Daily News and McCall, I can show you dozens of 
better juicier stories that never have seen the light of day--because they are 
contrary to what the Illuminati want people to hear. I won�t argue that a story 
on Satanism may be interesting, I am pointing out that many other interesting 
stories don�t get printed. Stories are selected by an editor, they don�t just 
happen.) Finally on June 19, 1972 Time Magazine provided more coverage for LaVey 
with an article �The Occult: A Substitute Faith.� Believe me, the sincere devout 
Christian groups haven�t ever received such nice free publicity. I�m not 
referring to men like 33� Mason Billy Graham, who works for the New World Order 
and Knights Templar Mason Charles T. Russell, founder of the Watchtower Society 
who both received great press coverage. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Another minor example, and I am pointing out minor examples because they 
occur many times during the course of year, is Van Daniken�s UFO books. Lew 
Wasserman, head of MCA, which owns G.P. Putnam�s Sons, is a member of the 
Rockefeller University Council. G.P. Putnam�s Sons published Van Daniken�s 
anti-Christian UFO religious theories. Cadence Industries own Marvel Comics. The 
men on the board of Cadence sit under David Rockefeller in places like the CFR. 
Is it any wonder Marvel Comics promotes the occult and heroes like �The Son of 
Satan�? Where does the buck stop? You say that the Rockefellers don�t control 
subordinates. Bear in mind, that many of the Rockefellers call themselves 
Baptists. If they are really Christians don�t you think they could use their 
influence to stop such terrible things? The point is that the rottenness starts 
at the top. The rest of the pyramid has a hard time turning out O.K. when the 
top of the pyramid is dedicated to Satan. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Rockefeller and Hearst worked together in their news monopolies. It was 
Hearst who promoted both books on Satanism and Billy Graham. (If you learn what 
I know--the two are not contradictory.) Hearst made Billy Graham who he is today 
by financially backing him and publicizing him. Rockefeller was supportive of 
Billy Graham�s New York Crusade, and the Manhattan-Chase Bank helped Billy 
Graham out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Maurice Strong is a good friend of the Rockefellers. He has been promoting 
Mother Gaia worship. David Rockefeller works with Maurice Strong and his New Age 
ideas. Reverend Moon from Korea has been very much loved by the Rockefellers. 
Moon calls himself Christ and is setting up a religion promoting 
internationalism. His religion is also a good testing ground for 
brainwashing/recruiting techniques that are being perfected by the NWO. The 
Rockefellers have been helping Moon, who also has his primary mansion in NY. 
Also of interest is that the prominent political figures that have endorsed Moon 
are those with ties to the NWO, and include Ted Kennedy, Mason Mark C. Hatfield, 
Mason Jesse Helms, &amp; Illuminatus William F. Buckley, Jr. (See pg. 32-33 of The 
Puppet Master by J. Isamu Yamamoto.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A lesser known group is the Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship (SFF) in 
Independence, MO. Their address was Exec. Plaza, 10715 Winner Rd, 64052. They 
were founded in 1956. Just like Reverend Moon they claim to be Christians, but 
teach and practice other things. They teach and practice the occult. Two 
prominent men in SFF are Marcus<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Bach and Gardner 
Murphy. They both have interesting backgrounds. Marcus Bach shows the touch of 
the Rockefellers. Marcus Bach, born in 1906, is director<span lang="en-gb">
</span>of special projects for SFF. The Rockefeller Foundation granted him a 
fellowship in �research and creative writing� from 1934-36. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Gardner Murphy was the consultant in<span lang="en-gb"> </span>1950 for 
UNESCO in New Delhi to the Hindus of the Indian Ministry of Education. From 
�52-�68 he was director of research at the Menninger Foundation, Topeka, KS. 
(Yes, psychology is led mainly by occultists!) Menninger himself is a member of 
several environmental groups for the elite, an Honorary trustee of the Aspen 
Institute, a Freemason, member of ACLU, and a close associate of W. Clement 
Stone. W. Clement Stone in turn is also a Mason, a member of the occult American 
Society for Psychical Research, and the financial backer of the Menninger 
Foundation. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Federal Council of Churches was financed to a large extent by Rockefeller 
money. In my Be Wise As Serpents book I detail how the FCC was designed to 
destroy Christianity, how they carefully plotted to make the creation of the FCC 
look like a grass roots movement, when it was actually the creation of the elite 
(Illuminati). I further detail how the men who ran it were high ranking Masons, 
Socialists, and One-Worlders. Also shown is how they carefully manipulated the 
real gospel for their own devious ends.</font></p>

6. They directly help control certain religious groups such as Lucis Trust.</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">David Rockefeller is part of Lucis Trust�s management. Lucis Trust puts out 
the book Externalization of the Hierarchy by Alice Bailey which spells out The 
Plan for the Satanists and New Agers on how the spiritual Hierarchy (actually 
the demonic hierarchy) is to externalize their rule of the planet. The book 
gives quite a few of the details of the plan, and is used as a textbook for New 
Agers at the Arcane Schools in NY, London, and Europe on how the New Age/One 
World Religion/One-World-Government will be brought in. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If anyone doubts the Rockefeller�s commitment to Satan, read page 107 of 
Externalization of the Hierarchy. On page 107 Alice Bailey, President of the 
Theosophical Society and part of Lucis (formerly Lucifer) Trust, tells us who 
will rule when the New Age (New World Order) takes over. On the Earthly 
level--Humanity so to speak, the Ruler is given on page 107 as Lucifer. On the 
Spiritual level--called �Shamballa - the Holy City� the coming ruler is given as 
�the Lord of the World� which we Christians know as Satan. Lucis Trust knows it 
is Satan too, but for public consumption they say that the �ruler of the world� 
is Sanat (a scrambling of Satan) Kumara. They also predict there will be a 
Christ Consciousness and the Christ (actually the Anti-Christ) The book 
Externalization of the Hierarchy teaches repeatedly (see pages 511-512, 514) 
that the 3 vehicles to bring in the New Age will be the Masonic Lodges, 
(obviously not everyone attends Lodges), next the Churches (this is clearly 
revealing to us that men like the Rockefellers are using the churches for the 
Luciferian plan of Lucis Trust), and finally Education (Well, of course 
education. Not everyone attends churches. They need a safety net to catch 
everyone in their brainwashing to make us all want to be happy slaves under the 
Light-bearer.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The home life of the Rockefellers is decidedly different than for most 
people. They have over 100 homes to stay at. The Rockefellers own vast tracts of 
good land in various countries in South America, and have nice homes in Brazil, 
Ecuador, and their Monte Sacro Ranch, Venezuela. They have two mansions in 
Washington, D.C. (at least), numerous ranches around the United States, resorts 
in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean, a 32- room 5th Ave duplex in N.Y., 
not to mention their place at Seal Harbor, Maine, and the large estate at 
Pocantico Hills, NY. It is estimated that they have 2,500 house servants. Over 
the years, they have built up the reputation of being miserly with their help, 
and to each other. (I couldn�t begin to know all about the Rockefellers, but I 
can give a sampling of some of the many items that surround the real lives of 
America�s top Illuminati family.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Winthrop, who is homosexual,, enjoyed living in Arkansas with his black male 
friend. He reportedly had the world�s largest porn collection. Winifred 
Rockefeller Emeny, Nelson�s cousin, murdered her two children and committed 
suicide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Michael Rockefeller died when he tried to bribe New Guinea tribesmen with 
large sums of money to go head hunt and make shrunken heads for him. The natives 
had given up head hunting and Michael couldn�t successfully bribe them. Finally 
getting tired of Michael, the natives decided to head hunt Michael himself!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Many of the Rockefeller family have had troubled lives, filled with all kinds 
of fears and occult activities. It is known that the Rockefellers have 
frequently built many hidden tunnels and hidden rooms onto their buildings. They 
have developed their occult and worldly powers to the point they consider 
themselves gods. Their powerful often suffer violent ritual death as most high 
level Satanists traditionally go through. One who died in Arizona is known to 
have been cremated.</font></p>

COVERING THE TOP 13 ILLUMINATI BLOODLINES?</a></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font> 
</b><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I have often been asked who are the Illuminati? Who are the people at the 
top of the conspiracy? Who are the generational satanic families? The Illuminati 
consists of 13 magical and powerful bloodlines. There are also some other 
powerful bloodlines that are worth naming but if they are in the Illuminati they 
have blood ties to one of the 13 powerful lineages. About half of the Illuminati 
people I know have had their parentage hidden from them. Many of the those who 
still know who their real parents are, still do not know what bloodline they 
belong to until the Illuminati chooses to reveal it to them. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most of the Illuminati have MPD. When high level Satanists do not have MPD 
they very often emotionally break under the stress of the horrible blood rituals 
that are required. Recently, a non-MPD Satanist in Chicago emotionally broke and 
gave his life to Christ. (I have videos available of an interview of this man 
exposing Satanism.) One of the important lineages has remained secret until 3 
investigators named Lincoln, Leigh, and Bageant were spoon-fed leads and 
secrets. They put this into a book called &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail.&quot; I recommend 
the book and the two books which are its sequels, because they show how just one 
part of the 13 lineages has kept itself secret and has taken immense power of 
all forms to themselves. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In Southern Belgium there is a castle. (If any one is traveling there and 
wants to find the castle, I will show them on the map, and describe it.) This is 
the Mothers of Darkness castle. In that castle, is a cathedral and in that 
cathedral�s basement a little baby Is sacrificed daily and Is coming to power. 
The pages are written almost round the clock. (This castle is also described in 
my Be Wise as Serpents book.) The history in that handwritten book would reveal 
the real facts behind the propaganda that the world�s major news medias give the 
gullible public. The history as that book reveals it would tell people about how 
Abraham Lincoln was a descendent of the Rothschild's. Abraham Uncoin was the 
secret head of the Rosicrucian's, a member of their 3 headed top council. (I 
have seen the paper trail proof to these things about Lincoln to my satisfaction 
that these things about Uncoin are true.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Adolph Hitler was also a secret member of the Rothschild lineage. Hitler 
carried out blood sacrifices to open his mind up to high level demonic spiritual 
control. Rockefeller sold Hitler oil during W.W. II via Spain to keep W.W. II 
going longer. The history in that book mentions people that the �history books� 
given the public don�t-- like Michael Augustus Martinelli Von Braun Rheinhold, 
the most powerful Satanist in the world a few years ago. Michael Augustus 
Martinelli Von Braun Rheinhold had 66 Satanic Brides. And that Satanic book in 
the Mothers of Darkness castle also mentions the Rockefeller bloodline. Only 
insiders are supposed to know the real history of what has taken place in human 
history. The real decisions and the real movers and shakers have been hidden 
from the public�s eyes. What the public is given is a stage show where 
Illuminati puppets parade around and make big speeches according to their 
script. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Each of the 13 families has their own set of Mothers of Darkness. Each of the 
13 families has their own secret Satanic leadership Kings, Queens, Princesses 
and Princes of Darkness. For instance, the Rockefeller family has people who are 
selected as Kings and Princes within their own bloodline in secret rituals. The 
Kings and Princes, Queens and Princesses are strictly bloodline. They secretly 
rule over an area of the world for their own bloodline. This is independent of 
the Illuminati's hierarchy which was diagrammed in the Jan 1993 newsletter. (my 
Newsletter from a Christian Ministry.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In the January, 1993 issue the Covens, Sisters of Light, Mothers of Darkness, 
and the Grande Mothers were diagrammed. The Illuminati pulls its various 
bloodlines together under several councils. The Grande Druid Council or your 
Council of 13 is your principle council for the Brotherhood of Death. Above the 
Council of 13 is a higher Council of 9, and an inner group of 3 is believed to 
head that Council of Nine. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">How do we know about these things? The power of God has reached into the very 
heart of Satan�s empire and pulled out some of the most powerful Satanists and 
drawn them to Christ. There are several Satanists that were at the top which 
have managed to find Christ<span lang="en-gb">,</span> in addition, some of the 
next echelon of the hierarchy, such as some of the Mothers of Darkness are also 
finding Christ.<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span lang="en-gb">I</span>f someone wants to understand how and why 
decisions are made in world affairs and by who-- then you need to study the 
Illuminati. The real answers do not rest with the proceedings of the Congress of 
the United States or with the publicly known leaders of the Communist countries. 
An example of what I am talking, there is a book entitled &quot;Who Financed Hitler&quot; 
by James Pool and Suzanne Pool. I am always glad to see that some people are 
wiling to look behind the scenes. Believe me, there were people that Hitler 
listened to. They were the people he went to ritual with, and who put him into 
power.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="PREFACE._">PREFACE.</a></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font>
</b><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The first article about the House of Rockefeller in this newsletter occurred 
in the Mid-Dec 1992 Vol. No. 13 Issue pp. 3-8. The primary focus of that article 
was to show how the family controlled large segments of the Protestant groups in 
the United States. A secondary focus of that article was to show the Satanic 
occult side of the family. An attempt will be made in this article not to rehash 
information given out in that earlier article. The Rockefeller family has been 
so busy and there Is a large amount of information that can be provided about 
them. Therefore my goal with this article Li to provide introductory information 
to the readership, and to qualify that what is written In this article Is but 
the basics of what should be written about the Illuminati activities of this 
family. Much of my own material on the Rockefeller family was lost this year and 
I don�t have the time to go back and research it again. Much of it involved the 
secret wheeling and dealing that went on behind the scenes to bring the 
Rockefellers into wealth and power. Some of the details also involved their 
manipulations to control about everything that the Rockefellers can find to 
control. Some of the research was on the occult activities of the House of 
Rockefeller.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="THE_FIRST_NOTORIOUS_ROCKEFELLER._">THE FIRST NOTORIOUS 
ROCKEFELLER.</a></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font> 
</b><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The first notorious Rockefeller that researchers who are not working for the 
Rockefellers refer to is William Avery Rockefeller (1810 -1906?). William Avery 
Rockefeller was totally corrupt and lacked any type of morals. He was involved 
in the occult and practiced magic. He married a number of women around the 
country in bigamous relationships. He also had a number of mistresses, and a 
large number of sexual partners. He was charged with raping a women and escaped 
the state of New York to prevent being sent to Jail for it. He stole, lied, and 
abused his way through life. He wore the best of clothes, and he never lacked 
for money, including gold coins. Besides loving women, he loved gambling. And 
where did his money to gamble with come from? He made much of his money 
dishonestly. His life Is a carbon copy of other men who are known by this author 
to have been in the Illuminati. (The reader also needs to bear in mind that the 
Illuminati carries out a large number of secret occult marriages, which only 
insiders learn about.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">One of his wives was Eliza Davidson (181349). She was an extremely cruel 
woman. Historians who have been bought off by the elite like to picture Eliza 
Davidson as a very pious woman. Although she had a religious front, there are a 
number of things in her life that show that she was not the paragon of virtue 
that the paid-for historians have made her out to be. When she married William 
Avery Rockefeller she moved in with him and his mistress.</font></p>

ROCKEFELLER.</a></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font>
</b><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">William Avery Rockefeller had many bastard children, and it can be imagined 
many children born for ritual or for the cult. His wife Eliza had six children 
for him and of those John Davison Rockefeller is the infamous one who brought 
the family into limelight. John D. Rockefeller in his lifetime became on of the 
most powerful men in the world. One of the most best kept secrets were his 
secret dealings with the other Illuminati families. The Payseurs and other 
Illuminati families are all intimately involved in the rise to power of the 
Rockefellers. The other factors involved in John D. Rockefeller�s rise to power 
Is his utter ruthlessness. He was willing to do anything for power. John o. 
Rockefeller established the family in their principal estate at Pocantico Hills 
in New York. I have lost the exact figure, but over 100 Rockefeller families 
live at the private land of Pocantico Hills.</font></p>

THE ROCKEFELLER�S INFLUENCE</a></font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font>
</b><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rockefellers have divested much of their holdings into places which they 
control, but nominally they are not owners of. The Rockefellers financial power 
Is far greater than the balance sheets would indicate. The Rockefellers can give 
donations from an organization which they control to another that they control, 
and not lose any control over the money. The donations look Impressive, but the 
Rockefeller bloodline hasn�t lost. Have you ever noticed that Rockefeller�s 
Standard Oil uses the satanic pentagram in a circle as their logo? Just three of 
countless Rockefeller companies are Texas Instruments and General Electric, and 
Eastman Kodak. The Rockefellers also control Boeing. This author (Fritz Spr<span lang="en-gb">i</span>ngmeier) 
has repeatedly been given information from numerous sources about the occult 
activities that are being perpetrated at the Boeing plants in the Seattle area. 
Monarch programming has even taken place at a Boeing Plant. All these things fit 
together when one gets the bigger picture and the inside scoop. The Rockefellers 
also control Delta. Has anyone realized that the Delta symbol is a very widely 
used satanic symbol? Is It any wonder so many Illuminati and CIA, and world 
financiers, and people like Chuck Co<span lang="en-gb">l</span>son (see the 
exposes on Chuck Colson in 93�s newsletters) use Delta to fly on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">My notes are lost, hut suffice It to say the Rockefellers own land all over 
South America. The Rockefellers own land most anywhere anyone would want to 
visit in the US. from Hawaii to Texas to Florida and Seal Harbor, Maine. Notice 
how often Bush would go to Maine when he was President?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rockefellers have played a role in Lucis Trust and the United Nations. 
Interestingly, you will notice that Prince Charles is the spokesperson for Lucis 
Trust and also works with the United Nations in various ways. Prince Charles Is 
from another satanic bloodline. Readers need to study my Be Wise As Serpents 
book to see how Lucis Trust fits into things. The Rockefellers were involved in 
the creation of the FBI, so that the FBI has always been an arm of power for the 
Illuminati. That is why there are official FBI programs in action today to 
kidnap children and provide them for sacrifice. Yes, American people, the wolf 
was set in charge of guarding the chicken coop. The organization that is working 
as part of the FBI is the Finders. (The stink was so bad that US. News &amp; World 
Report did a story to soften the impact of the scandal. See the article on a 
following page. Ex-Satanists who worked with the FBI to receive the children the 
FBI kidnapped and sold to them for sacrifice have been trying to get the word 
out publicly about the FBI�s corruption. When the Illuminati was beginning to 
get exposed in the Franklin Saving &amp; Loan case in Lincoln, NE the FBI was part 
of the dirty actors and was part of the cover up. The Rockefellers have had 
control over the FBI since they helped get it started. When Congress wanted to 
investigate the CIA for wrongdoing the appointed a Commission headed by 
Rockefeller to investigate the CIA�s wrongdoings! Yes, the Rockefeller 
Commission did a big study and slapped the hands of the CIA for a few misdeeds. 
Their report is still cited as the big investigation of the CIA. Some 
investigation! Since the Rockefeller family work hand in hand with the CIA to 
create Monarch slaves, of course that part of the CIA�s misdeeds got overlooked!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A recent convert from Satanism, Michael McArthur, has given validated inside 
information about the FBI and the CIA programs which kidnap children in order to 
supply Satanic rituals with sacrificial material. The names of the agents who 
spend their official government time kidnapping children for Satanism that 
Michael knows about are as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Chucky �Mike,� �Peters�-FBI hit man in Div, 5 of FBI, involved with ins law 
case Nichol Harrah--FBI agent who abducts children for sacrifice<br>
Unda Krieg Satanist working for FBI<br>
Ken Lanning FBI agent who abducts children for sacrifice<br>
Nick O�Hara FBI hit man, Satanist, has covered FBI child kidnappings by murder 
Kape Richardson CIA agent who abducts children for sacrifice</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Rather, than risk&nbsp;election, a brilliant coup d�etat which Is exposed in Be 
Wise As Serpents. was carried out to put Nelson A. Rockefeller into the 
Vice-Presidency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000">The Rockefellers control both education and religion in this country by their 
foundations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rockefellers have played key roles in the CFR. Rockefeller wrote the book 
the Future of Federalism which supports the union of nations into a world 
government. For many years the Rockefellers have been pouring billions of 
dollars into projects and international groups which are working to bring in a 
public One-World government. (The world already has a secret 
One-World-Government.) The Rockefellers take part in decisions that effect 
Russia, China and other parts of As<span lang="en-gb">i</span>a and with good 
reason, the House of Rockefeller has holdup and assets in these countries too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The investigator of the Rockefellers will find that they have secretly had 
their hand in the politics of the United States during the 20th century. The 
decisions and directions this nation has taken, are the result of countless 
orders which the Rockefellers have given to their underlings.</font></p>

Rothschilds to have a sure leverage to dictate policy concerning Palestine. The 
Rothschilds had made loans to Turkey which amounted to almost one hundred

those unpaid Turkish loans.</font><a href="#4"><font color="#FFFFFF">4</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">

buy all of Erez Israel. It took many years for the Rothschilds to finally create 
Israel. The Rothschilds have been a primary force behind the creation of Israel, 
and so it is appropriate that the nation carries their magical Seal of Solomon 
as the state logo. The Ultra-orthodox Jews in Israel will not serve in the 
Israeli army because they know that Almighty God was not behind the creation of 
modern Israel, but rather the rich ungodly apostate Jews. They refuse to serve 
the ungodly. They are more wiser than men like Jerry Falwell who run around 
proclaiming Israel is God�s nation. Men like Falwell are the type that this 
Author finds reference to repeatedly in Jewish documents that speak of their 
power within the Fundamentalists. God is ultimately in charge, he has allowed 
Hitler to come to power, Stalin to come to power, and the Rothschilds to come to

<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">To twist scriptures about God seating the rulers and then to apply them to 
bless one Satanic secular communist nation and not another is inconsistent and 
not correctly using the Word of Truth. Some people object that the conspiracy of 
Power is labelled Jewish rather than Satanic by certain concerned citizens. This 
objection is valid-- however, will these objectors then take the obvious next 
step and admit the nation of Israel which the Rothschild�s created is Satanic 
and not Jewish? But then who knows precisely why people do what they do? If you 
ask someone why he does something, he will give you one answer today, another 
tomorrow, and another the next day. Does he do what he does for a real reason, 
or a single motive? Perhaps to label the Power as only Satanic or only Jewish or 
only Masonic is to neglect the personal human dimension. This personal human 
dimension is godless. Being godless it fills that void, by pretending its men 
are gods. This brings us right back to the Gnostic religions and Satan. Most 
Jewish people do not concern themselves with learning the occultic significance 
to their treasured Magen David (Star of David). King David did not have anything 
to do with the hexagram, although his son Solomon did when he began worshipping

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Money naturally attracts itself to evil. For instance, if a woman prostitutes 
herself she may receive a great sum of money, but who will pay her for keeping 
her virginity or her dignity? If you are a hit man a large amount of money is 
yours if you kill your target, who will pay you if you would miss your target?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Second, evil men believe in where there is a will there is a way, and they 
are willing to sell their souls for their God money. They will employ evil to 
gain money.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">While most people are quite aware of these last two connections, a third may 
likely have escaped their attention. Thirdly, the principle group of men who 
cranked up International Banking were Satanists from the beginning. These 
Satanists now are the ones who run the Federal Reserve and are responsible for 
the creation of U.S. Federal Reserve notes. Just having total control over the 
supply of U.S. paper money almost gives them leverage over the world�s finances, 
without mentioning they control the world bank. It is no accident then, that 
once they established world financial control, they would do all in their power 
to divide and conquer and destroy both the Christian and the Moslem faith in 
God. These powerful Bankers relate to faith in God as Cain related to his 
brother Abel. That they may be related to the Jewish people, does not mean they 
have the Jewish people�s best interest at heart. Initially Sabbetai Zevi was 
rejected by many Jews. His sect gained momentum in second half of the 
seventeenth century in southeastern Poland.(</font><a href="#42"><font color="#FFFFFF">42</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">) In 1759-60,

In 1715, 109 of the 415 Jewish families in Frankfurt were engaged in

Cologne. The Oppenheimers were early members of the Bavarian Illuminati. The 
Bund der Gerechten (League of the Just) was an Illuminati front run mainly by 
Jews who were Satanists. This Bund financed in part by the Rothschilds paid the 
Satanist and Mason Karl Marx to write the Communist Manefesto. The Jew Gumpel 
Oppenheim was in the inner circle of the Bund. His relative Heinrich Oppenheim 
masterminded the communist revolution of 1848 in Germany. The Communist Party�s

Masonic lodge the Rothschilds belonged to in Frankfurt) included the Adlers, 
Speyers, Reisses, Sichels, Ellisons, Hanaus, Geisenheimers, and Goldschmidts. 
Isaac Hildesheim, a Jew who changed his name to Justus Hiller is credited as 
being the founder of this Frankfurt lodge. Michael Hess, principal of the 
Reformed Jewish school Philanthropin was an important figure in the lodge too, 
as was Dr. Ludwig Baruch (later Borne) who joined in 1808. Most of these 
Frankfurt Jewish Freemasons engaged in commerce.(</font><a href="#54."><font color="#FFFFFF">54</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">) Those 
Freemasons from 1817-1842 were the leaders of the Frankfurt Jewish community.</font><sup><a href="#55."><font color="#FFFFFF">55</font></a></sup><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
A gentile Mason in Frankfurt Johann Christian Ehrmann began warning the German 
people that the Frankfurt Jewish Masons wanted a world republic based on 
humanism. In 1816 he came out with a warning pamphlet Das Judenthum in der 
M[aurere]y (The Jews in Masonry). A powerful ally of the world�s Jewry can be 
seen beginning with men like Oliver Cromwell, who was considered a Mason.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Cromwell was financed by Jews, and helped the Jews gain power in England. 
Cromwell was willing to go along with the Jews, because he became convinced of 
British Israelism. Since the core of the conspiracy of power is Jewish, the 
attitude of those allied with it hinges on their attitude toward the Jewish 
people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The religious idea that the British people are descended from the tribes of 
Israel doesn�t automatically place people into the camp of the conspiracy. Some 
of the British-Israelites realize that the so called Jewish people in general 
have no claim over the promises of God. For that reason, they realize that it is 
not the Christian duty to bow and scrape at their every move. When Christians 
can be arrested in Israel and abused, and Christians will not even stand up for 
their own kind, we can see how much hold the idea of the &quot;Chosen Race&quot; theory 
has over Christendom. Some of the British Israelites such as the Mormons, the 
old New England wealthy families such as make up the Order, some Masons and New 
Agers, and the non-Jewish members of the Priuere de Sion are collaborating with 
the One-World-Power. The Anglican church which is run by the Freemasons is 
strongly British Israelistic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In contrast, a hodge-podge of groups which are opposed to the conspiracy like 
some Neo-Nazi groups, and various Churches unrelated with them are also 
believers in British Israelism. These various groups are sometimes all lumped 
together as the &quot;Identity&quot; movement, which is misleading because of their vast 
differences. It is important to differentiate between those groups that are 
trying to approach things from a Christian perspective and place themselves 
under the authority of God, and those who are setting themselves up under the 
New Order�s authority, or under their own authority.</font></p>

Networks showing that the Rothschilds have control of all three U.S. Networks,

that they control Reuters too. From other sources it appears CNN, which began as 
an independent challenge to the Jewish Network monopoly, ran into repeated 
trickery, and ended up part of the system. Money from B.C.C.I., (B.C.C.I. has

direction. To illustrate this we will examine who run the networks. This list is

THE ROTHSCHILD�S HISTORY BY A JEWISH WRITER RELATED TO THE ROTHSCHILDS</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Jewish writer Anka Muhlstcin wrote a book Baron James The Rise of the French 
Rothschilds. I prefer paraphrase and make short quotes from her book, because I 
am trying to document for the reader the mindset and history of the Rothschilds. 
Anka Muhlstein has nothing against the Rothschilds, so it will be easier for the 
reader to accept what she says about them than from me. I can�t require the 
reader to read her book, but I can try to summarize some of the appropriate 
thoughts. Other books also relate many of the things Anka does, but again if I 
write a footnoted article, it will not carry the weight as my paraphrase will. 
The reader is recommended to read the book first hand if he has the time and is 
interested in the details of James� life. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Jews in the 18th century were restricted to living in Ghettos. Mayer 
Amschel Rothschild lived in the Frankfurt ghetto. (p.22) The Jews were repressed 
by outsiders. (p.23) They lived in geographically isolated and self-contained 
communities (p. 24). The Jewish communities in Europe used a secret relay system 
between all the Ghettoes. Hebrew characters were one effective code. (p.24) 
Because of the persecution and repression, the Jewish communities were very 
tight- knit and highly organized. (p.23) They were deeply hostile to the 
Christian people. Christians had restricted their own people from money-lending 
with interest, so lending money on interest had become a Jewish enterprise. The 
German princes of Thurn and Taxis in the 16th century initiated a postal 
service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mayer Amschel loaned them money. (p.21) &quot;Certainly they [the Rothschilds] 
discovered the latitude that the Thurn and Taxis allowed themselves in unsealing 
letters, possibly divulging their contents, and according to their own 
interests, delaying or accelerating delivery. &quot;(p.22) When it profited Mayer 
Amschel, he would hire Christians, but in general his business and banking were 
conducted by his close knit family. For instance Mayer Amschel hired a young 
Christian woman to write his letters for him. (p. 25) Mayer Amschel Rothschild 
and his family were wholeheartedly Jewish. (p.27) Mayer Amschel Rothschild 
picked his sons� wives for the business gains the wives would bring the family. 
The oldest son was not happy with this (actually he was bitter because he was 
denied marriage to the woman he loved), but he complied with his father�s 
choice. (p.26) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Amschel�s daughters all married bankers--in Worms, Sichel, and Beyfus. (p.26) 
Mayer had ten children and they were all employed in the family business. (p.25) 
The Jews were taught from childhood up, that the Christians were to blame for 
all their woes, and that the Christians were to be feared and detested. (p.24) 
Mayer Amschel had secret, underground passages. (p.22) His carriage was 
honey-combed with secret drawers. (p.27) The Napoleonic War greatly helped the 
Rothschild business. (p. 27) Rothschild even outsmarted Napoleon--because the 
Rothschilds had such good connections. (p.38) The Rothschilds smuggled during 
the English blockade of Napoleon�s Europe, and made millions. (p.33) &quot;The 
Rothschilds changed course constantly during this period, always manoeuvring to 
avoid any kind of political commitment. &quot;(p.34) One of the things Mayer Amschel 
set up, was to disperse his 5 sons to the major capitals of Europe. Anka 
attributes the respectibility of Jewish money lending to the help it gave 
merchants and entrepreneurs. [See chap. 3.2 -this Author�s view is that 
merchants had been borrowing for centuries prior to interest taking becoming 
acceptable by society in the 19th century.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>It was 
greatly in part due to who owned and controlled the major newspapers in the 19th 
century--Jews and Masons--that led the public to change.] </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;The obligation to reimburse a loan and to pay interest became less onerous 
to men whose affairs had flourished as a result of the borrowed money. The 
Jewish lender ceased to be a bloodsucker; often, indeed, he became an associate 
of the borrower.&quot; (p.31) [The Bible says a borrower is a slave to the lender, 
hardly an association to be desired.] </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The business of financing Monarchs was lucrative. The Rothschilds had 
developed several traits in the ghetto that made their family hard to stop. &quot;The 
great gift the Frankfurt ghetto bestowed upon him [James Rothschild] was 
adaptibility, a quality matched by the driving force of his ambition, his 
prodigious energy, tremendous powers of concentration, and determination to get 
even [with Christians]. James set out to make his place in the world.&quot; (p.40) 
The five Rothschild brothers, each in the five major European capitals set up 
their own private courier system which was faster than the regular mail. (p.47) 
The Rothschilds had news whether political or economic faster than anyone else 
including the monarchs. &quot;Thus the Rothschilds had news before anyone else, 
including ministers [govt.]; they also understood how to make use of it.&quot; (p.47) 
[Somewhat akin to how money could be made off of knowing the future.] The 
Rothschilds nomal correspondence to each other was in code.(p.46) Their world 
was one of finance, politics and secrecy. In the anti-Napoleonic time period, 
the Rothschilds increased their wealth ten-fold. (p.47) &quot;...James. He enjoyed, 
moreover, a rock-solid strength and stability, built up by his family, that 
family simultaneously closed tight like a fist, united by mutual confidence and 
an invisible wall of secrecy, yet wide open to the outside world. Such was the 
cohesion of the Rothschilds that the removal of one or more of them left no gap 
in their common defenses.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rothschilds carried out espionage with their own intelligence service, 
and other questionable subversive activities but none of these could be tracked. 
&quot;Whenever Mayer Amschel and his sons were on the verge of being caught out, some 
highly placed person stepped in and stopped the investigation.&quot; (p.36)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The made their money doing technically illegal activity. The original large 
sum of money made was to take the Elector of Hesse�s large sum and instead of 
investing it into government bonds as directed--to put it to use at investments 
of higher returns, and giving the elector the return from the government bonds. 
Anka writes, &quot;The Elector was never the wiser, but even if he had been, he could 
hardly have complained of disobedience.&quot; (p.34) In summary, the Mafia-like 
closeness of the Rothschild family, along with their tactic to situate 
themselves in all the major capitals, along with their own quick secret personal 
news/intelligence/mail service gave them the contacts and the power to 
manipulate all kinds of business opportunities.</font></p>

INTO SATAN�S PLANS?</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Let me briefly recap what some of the plan was. And while you read these 
plans that I am relaying to you from my intensive research on high level 
Satanism, see if you don�t see the irony in the Satanic plans. How very ironic 
it is that in all the twisted thinking and reasoning of the leading Satanists 
for why they must do things, it is surprising they do not catch on that this 
plan of Satan�s is going to achieve God�s revealed plan. How pride does blind 
us! (For the sake of brevity I will dispense with my normal method of 
documenting everything; I suggest that my book Be Wise As Serpents be read for 
documentation, and further questions be written to me. Otherwise this article 
would be way to bulky for the newsletter.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The &quot;brilliant&quot; plan given in detail to the Illuminati was to create a thesis 
and its opposite called the antithesis . The process would repeat itself until 
the desired outcome . Out of the battle between the two would emerge the 
synthesis . Out of the battle of chaos would come a new order reminding us of 
the Masonic slogan &quot;Order out of Chaos.&quot; If the thesis were like a hammer and 
the antithesis like an anvil, what was caught in between would be broken or 
reshaped . Three world wars would enable the plan to work. The hammer would be 
constructed and then given a homeland, a secure base in Russia . It is what we 
call communism. The first anvil would be created out of economic chaos in 
Germany . It would be called National Socialism . That anvil would be destroyed 
in a Second World War, but another anvil would replace it called democracy. The 
first two world wars accomplished exactly what they were intended to accomplish. 
Out of the first world war came:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(1) A secure Satanic dictatorship in Russia, a secure base to carry out 
further world subversion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(2) The Satanic family of Rothschilds gained partial control over Palestine, 
preparing the way for Satan to rule from Jerusalem some day</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(3) Weapons of mass destruction and terror.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(4) The League of Nations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Out of the second world war came</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(1) The enlargement of their secure base in Russia into a world power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(2) complete control over Palestine by the Rothschilds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(3) airpower, including long range missiles, jets, secret flying saucers, and 
powerful submarines, all items that individuals could not produce . Those in 
control of production would therefore control all air and sea ways of the earth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(4) The cold war and an era of terror to convince the people of the need for 
Satan�s One World Order.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">(5) the United Nations .</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Out of the third world war would emerge a new religious system . The third 
world war would have to be tailored to be like the Bible�s Armageddon, Satan 
told his highest slaves, because- if it resembled Armageddon, then the people 
would believe he was the Messiah when he came after its end . It would have to 
be terrible, so that he could step in and bring miraculous order out of a world 
beaten into chaos by the worst war in history. Again it would be &quot;Order out of 
chaos&quot;, as the Masonic documents repeatedly proclaim. The third world war would 
come during a period of seven years of tribulation starting in 1992 and running 
until 1999. Just like the Second World War emerged out of the great world-wide 
depression. Satan told his followers this 1992-99 tribulation would repeat on a 
larger scale the plagues of Egypt, for he would wreck revenge for what was done 
to Egypt by God (and Moses) by giving back in a bigger way to the world what 
happened to ancient Egypt . To a demonic controlled mind it makes sense to wreck 
such revenge, especially when the end result is held out to be the salvation of 
the world by the Lightbearer, the Morning Star, also known as Lucifer. For most 
of us, the idea of such pain and destruction seems like demonic madness- - which 
it is .</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At the core of the One-World-System is Satanism. It hides itself behind 
fronts such as Jewish Finance, Socialism, Aryanism, British Israelism, Zionism, 
and Freemasonry which are tools to get the broad masses to serve the Plan. The 
&quot;conspiracy&quot; to create the One-World-System has enlisted the help of almost 
everyone. That is because most of the religious systems at the top are 
controlled by Satanists who know what they are doing and direct the people�s 
religious efforts. (Read the research in Be Wise As Serpents for the 
documentation on this.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Nazism was a Pagan Gnostic religious system whose High Priest Hitler knew 
what he was doing in relation to Satan�s mission. (More about this further 
down.) The Jewish people (1 use the term in its broadest sense) are being used. 
Actually the allegiance of the Satanic hierarchy is not in the least concerned 
with Judaism, although it appears that at first the plans are to create a 
religious leader that will have the apparent credentials of the Jewish messiah. 
How sad, because the actions of the Rothschilds and other Satanic &quot;Jewish&quot; 
bloodlines during W.W. II show that their first allegiance is not to the Old 
Testament and not to even Orthodox Judaism, but is purely to Satan. At some 
point in the future the Orthodox Jews and the Conservative Jews will find that 
this Messiah, who is already alive waiting to play his role, will only give them 
temporary relief. They are being taken for a ride and then they will be dumped 
by the New World Order�s dictatorship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Constance Cumbey correctly notices that the New Age movement resembles Nazism 
exactly to a T . For those students wanting to get a detail by detail parallel 
go to pages 114 to 120 in The Hidden Dangers Of The Rainbow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1952, James Larratt Battersby in England published The Holy Book of Adolf 
Hitler for the German World Church in Europe . Except for some of his pro-German 
ideas, obviously thrown in to make the book enlist the intended audience�s 
favor, the book is an exact description of what would happen in the next 50 
years to bring in the New World Order. The reason some of the prognostications 
of pro-German ideas are not valid is that the Satanic hierarchy is not really 
concerned for the German people either, except to harness their help in their 
plans . Batterby�s Holy Book of Adolf Hitler was given to him &quot;in the spirit&quot; . 
According to Battersby the book was written in order that &quot;May God open the eyes 
of the Gentiles to Truth, and carry his Holy Gospel to the ends of the earth&quot; . 
The book is an excellent synopsis of what Satan had planned in 1952 and has 
carried out since to a large degree. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rothschilds (and other top Satanic families in a lesser way) financed a 
Jewish Mason and devote Satanist named Karl Marx to write his Das Kapital . The 
Satanists controlling key Masonic groups (along with some other groups they 
controlled) got Communism started. The original idea came from Satan, and was 
given at a Feast of the Beast in meticulous detail to those highest in the 
Satanic Hierarchy . Albert Pike, and Guiseppe Mazzini were two men in strategic 
positions of control that were let in on the plans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">After creating International Socialism (communism) a temporary antithesis was 
created called National Socialism (nazism). The process to create National 
Socialism was to turn again to the Masonic Lodges and other esoteric secret 
Societies to get it done. Therefore, the secret esoteric Gnostic and satanic 
societies along with the Illuminati helped create &quot;the Thule Gesellshaft&quot; (in 
English the Thule Society) . Adolf Hitler was some type of member of this occult 
Thule Society, along with many other men who later began leading Nazi leaders 
such as Rudolf Hess. The Thule Society used the Masonic/Hindu symbol the 
Swastika, which the Nazi party then also used as its symbol. In other words the 
grandmother of the Nazi Party was the Masonic Lodges in Germany. The Vril was 
another secret occult group that many of the Nazi leadership belonged to. Hitler 
also was a member of the Theosophical Society, which has strong Satanic and 
Masonic ties. Both Bailey and Hitler studied from Tibetians, Hindus, occultists, 
and black magicians. They also both studied the Gnostics, and every major 
Pagan/Occult religious system. A example of how valued the Swastika was for 
Freemasons before Hitler ruined its image, is a quote from Joseph Fort Newton, a 
Baptist Minister and high ranking Mason, &quot;The second of these volumes also 
contains an essay. . . by Thomas Carr, with a list of Lodges, and a study of 
their history, customs, and emblems- -especially the Swastika .</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Speculative Masons are now said to be joining, seeking more light on what are 
called the <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>Lost Symbols of Masonry.&quot; After promoting 
and using the Swastika for years the Freemasons quit using it after Hitler. The 
Holy Book of Hitler provides the answer as to why the Theosophical Society 
worked so hard to destroy the British Empire. It had always at first mystified 
me why the Theosophical Society Presidents who connected to the Satanic 
hierarchy would want to ruin the British Empire. The reason it seemed strange is 
that the mother country of Satanism and Witchcraft is Great Britain. The center 
of secret political power is geographically in England. And further, one of the 
largest and most powerful secret fronts for Satanism is British-Israelism. The 
reason why the British Empire was destroyed was that Satan had already 
determined even before 1870 that the steps to world government would include 
setting up around 9 or 10 Continental blocs . The Union of Europe into one 
country (or bloc) could not be accomplished while Great Britain had most of her 
focus on her empire. Great Britain as long as she had an empire would never want 
to join up with Europe. In fact all the European nations would have to be 
convinced to give up their colonies, that is why the World Power got everyone 
they could get to help fight Portugal in Angola in recent history, everyone 
including the large Masonic-controlled Christian denominations who donated 
millions of dollars to the NCC and WCC which moneys were then passed on to the 
guerrillas to buy weapons and ammo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Theosophical Society is mostly to blame for India�s independence from 
Britian. First, the Theosophical Society managed to change British policy so 
that the British became unpopular. Then Theosophical President Besant, who 
published the largest English paper strongly criticized British rule in her 
newspapers and eventually was arrested . Gandhi and other Indian leaders were 
involved in Besant being made the President of the Indian Congress Party. And 
that political party still rules Indian politics . The Theosophist Mahatma 
Gandhi, following in the steps of Theosophical President Annie Besant, led the 
Indian people against British rule.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">But the final blow to the British Empire was done by another 
Theosophist--Adolf Hitler. It is common knowledge that the powerful blows of 
Axis attacks in W.W. II struck the death blow to the British Empire, or so we 
are told. The truth is that the elite wanted the Empire to die, and pulled every 
string to convince the British public and indigenous natives that the Empire was 
too weak after W . W . II to save the empire and prevent her colonies from 
independence. It is hard for people to grasp that the Illuminati controlled 
Russia, Great Britian, Germany and France during World War II, but they did. 
Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin were all Masons . DeGaulle of France was 
closely linked with several esoteric groups, and the Priere de Sion and Grand 
Orient Masons helped him to power in the 50s . Churchill was a Zionist and 
pro-Fabian Socialist . Stalin was a closet satanist . Roosevelt was a Zionist, 
pro-communist and socialist . Both Churchill and Roosevelt came from important 
elite blood lines . Apparently, Stalin was somewhat independent, but basically 
did what was expected of him. As the previous paragraph indicates the people of 
the world weren�t ready for a world government, and most not even a united 
Europe. W.W. II was carried out to adjust people�s thinking toward wanting 
European unity . Satan already ruled the world through his secret chain of 
command, but he wanted to openly rule the world�s hearts and to be publicly 
hailed as ruler and savior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Who was Hitler? Hitler�s father was the offspring of the Rothschild�s secret 
breeding program which impregnated his grandmother. It appears from the details 
available, Hitler was groomed for his role, without realizing his heritage at 
first . It appears that Hitler learned of his <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>Jewish 
bloodline&quot; after taking over Germany. Hitler had romances with many beautiful 
women. Although Hitler was very strict with his New Age religious practices such 
as being a vegetarian, that did not include being celebrate . He did have sex 
contrary to the deceptions of the Establishment. Hitler�s seed (the Rothschild�s 
powerful generational occult bloodline) was hidden in an Ashkenazim bloodline, 
at least part of which has come to the U.S. In fact, Hitler�s generational 
occult power was passed on too . This was most likely done by thrusting a knife 
into his heart, and the person who received his occult power then gulped his 
last breath with the kiss of death to receive his occult power . What I am 
telling you is that Hitler�s offspring are alive and well and that his 
terrifying Anti-Christ spirit was passed to someone and is not dead. Let me 
remind you of some of Hitler�s own prophecies about himself and his goals. &quot;At 
the time of supreme peril I must die a martyr�s death for the people. But after 
my death will come something really great, an overwhelming revelation to the 
world of my mission.&quot; The world was to witness his divinity . Further, &quot;My 
spirit will rise from the grave, and the world will see that I was right.&quot; Von 
Ribbentrop on Apr. 30, 1945 was told this same thing, &quot;You will see that my 
spirit will rise from the grave . &quot; National Socialism &quot;is even more than a 
religion; it is the will to make mankind anew.&quot; &quot;All creative energy will pass 
to the new man.&quot; Hitler claimed to be the real fulfillment of Marx�s socialism. 
&quot;I am not only the conqueror, but also the executor of Marxism, of that part of 
it which is essential and justified, stripped of its Jewish-Talmudic dogma.&quot; In 
essence, he is saying whatever veneer of Jewishness that Marx�s satanic plan 
had, he disagreed with it and would destroy that veneer . These type of 
statements reveal that the essence of the message of various elite men like 
Hitler is the same Satanic plan if stripped of their variously decorated veneers 
.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hitler is viewed as the Messiah, the Holy Spirit, the martyred Saviour of his 
people by his followers today. The blasphemous Holy Book of Adolf Hitler states, 
&quot;All hail to God�s Christ and Chosen, Adolf Hitler...Lord of Lords, and King of 
Kings, the Eternal Adolf Hitler.&quot; Such blasphemy . Father forgive them for they 
know not what they do. Hitler�s Demonic Spirit and Hitler�s descendents both 
live on today. (By the way, some Rothschild descendents such as Hitler�s have 
come to Christ as their Lord and Savior!) Will this powerful occult branch of 
the Rothschild�s be used again by the New World Order? Whatever the case it is 
clear that Hitler�s Anti-Christ spirit will get plenty of demonic help. The 
demonic forces that have manifested themselves in National Socialism and 
International Socialism (aka Communism) demonized much of Europe. So much so 
that Europe officially portrays itself as a beast with Venus on it on a stamp 
commemorating the Second election of the European Parliament, and also as the 
same forces that tried to build the Tower of Babel on an official poster. Not 
only are the same demons that led communist leaders and Nazi leaders operating 
in Europe�s leaders, but there are armies of demons trampling over anything of 
moral value in Europe . It can be said without a doubt that the
<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>man&quot; who rules the One-World-Government will derive 
his power from a demonic supernatural source . According to Revelations, God is 
going to have an angel open up a key to the abyss and teeming hordes of demonic 
spirits shall be descending upon the earth . My conclusion is that Satan has so 
many Anti-Christs available that Hitler�s personal occult power is not necessary 
for the New World Order�s success .</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I rarely like to comment on the end times from Scriptures because I feel like 
most people are thoroughly confused about the clear teachings that the 
Scriptures give. 2 Thes. 2:3 and other Scriptures make it clear that the 
Christians must witness a great apostasy and the Anti-Christ being revealed 
before Christ returns . We can live everyday as if it may be our last, but 
Scriptures are clear that the Apostles did not live each day as if Jesus could 
return that day. They knew that certain things had to happen first . The church 
has been going through tribulations since Pentecost . The church will go through 
the &quot;great tribulation&quot; according to the Word of God . We will if we are that 
faithful remnant we will be spared from the Wrath of God, but we will not be 
spared from the tribulation of Satan which shall include martyrdom . The New Age 
leaders are fully ready to cooperate with this &quot;cleansing&quot; from the earth of us 
bothersome disciples of Truth. In this respect, their thinking will resemble the 
Nazi�s rationalizations that people must pay their Karmic debt, and shall 
benefit from being killed . How truth can be stood on its head! The Plans are 
already drawn up how to use rail lines to move large groups of civilians to 
labour camps . When we compare Nazi Germany with today�s New World Order plans, 
Nazi Germany can be seen to be the basic model of what Satan�s timetable 
includes for us these next few years .</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">To illustrate that the Pagan religion of Nazism is an example to the 
Satanists and New Agers, let us ponder Anton LaVey�s (head of a visible Church 
of Satan) trip to the sacred initiation castle of Hitler�s Black Order the SS . 
The SS apparently brought the Holy Grail to Germany, and hid it before the end

THE ROTHSCHILDS<span lang="en-gb">:&nbsp; </span>A CONTINUATION OF ARTICLES ON THE 
TOP 13 ILLUMINATI FAMILIES</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">INTRODUCTION by Fritz Springmeier</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rothschilds are one of the most well-known of the thirteen families. 
David J. Smith of Portland was asked to prepare an article on the Rothschilds 
for this newsletter. His article follows this introduction. Satan�s selective 
breeding program has been continuing down through the ages hidden from the eyes 
of the public. One of the most powerful Rothschild bloodline families in America 
are the Springs. The Springs were originally the Springsteins when they came to 
America in the mid-I 1700s and settled in NY and NJ. They later changed their 
name from Springstein to Springs to hide their identity. Leroy Springs was hired 
by LC. Payseur. Now most American�s have to ask, who is L.C. Payseur? One of the 
most secret and most powerful families in North America has been the Payseurs. 
They have been so powerful that they could hide their wealth and power, and use 
other Satanic families as proxies. The Payseurs are part of the
<span lang="en-gb">1</span>3th top Illuminati family. The first Payseur to come 
to America was the former crown prince of France Daniel Payseur (1785-1860). He 
came over about 1805 to the U.S. and married Susannah Kiser c. 1814. They had 
two boys Adam and Jonas (1819-1 884). Jonas married Harrietta Smith and they had 
Lewis Cass Payseur (1850-1939). It was this Lewis Cass Payseur who hired the 
Rothschild bloodline of the Springs to run a number of the Payseur�s companies. 
The Payseurs were one of the original big railroad families along with Issac 
Croom and William H. Beatty. Isaac Croom�s wife was a sister of William 
Beatty�s, so the reader can see how all these elite bloodlines intertwine. 
Remember that LC. Payseur hired Leroy Springs to operate a host of his 
companies. Leroy Springs father was A.A. Springs and A.A. Springs was the secret 
father of Abraham Lincoln.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1808, Nancy Hanks, of the lineage of the McAdden Scottish family visited 
some of her family at Lincolnton, N.C. Nancy Hawks visited the Springs family 
and that is when A.A. Springs impregnated her, and her child when born was named 
Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln�s Rothschild blood was kept very secret, but he 
did grow up to be a famous lawyer, a secret leader of the Rosicrucians, and 
President of the United States. It is believed from the evidence that the 
establishment conspiracy concocted the person of Thomas Lincoln out of thin air. 
The actual early history of Abraham Lincoln is shrouded in myth and mystery, and 
as one encyclopedia puts it, &quot;We know little about the family of his mother, 
Nancy Hanks Lincoln.&quot; While a lawyer, Abraham Lincoln had a sexual liaison with 
Elizabeth who was the illegitimate daughter of German King Leopold, who is also 
of elite blood lineage. Abraham Lincoln and Elizabeth had two twin daughters 
Ella and Emily in 1856 who were adopted out. Lincoln in fact had a fairly large 
number of illegitimate children. Now A. A. Springs, who was both the biological 
father of Leroy Springs and Abraham Lincoln left an enormous amount of land in 
what is now Huntsville, AL to his son Abraham Lincoln. Huntsville, AL by the way 
has become a hotbed of NWO activity. Some of the mind-control research the 
intelligence community has been conducting has been done at Huntsville.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rothschilds even named one of their boys after Abraham Lincoln, his name 
was Lincoln Rothschild. Although Abraham Lincoln secretly had powerful occult 
blood, he was a great man in his own right. And just like JFK, he had the 
strength of personality to refuse to bow to the Illuminati�s instructions. 
Lincoln refused to go the path that his distant European International Banking 
Rothschild relatives wanted for the United States. The Illuminati goal had been 
to split the U.S. into two easier to control nations. And just as with JFK, who 
also came from a top 13 family, a large scale conspiracy Involving many 
government officials including the Secretary of Defense was put into place to 
assassinate Lincoln. There are numerous indications that show that the 
Rothschilds were in part behind the assassination of Lincoln. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Some of the men who worked for the Payseurs of the 13th top family were 
Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, the Vanderbilts, Giftord Pinnchot, and John D 
Rockefeller. These men were selected to run Payseur companies because they 
belonged to the satanic elite. The Leroy Springs family got Payseur family 
companies in the early 1920s. It was Leroy that managed to get the Rothschild�s 
involved with the Federal Reserve. Two companies that have come out of the 
Payseur�s old Lancaster Manufacturing Co. ins Weyerhaeuser and Crown-Zellerbach. 
I have long know these were companies tied to the elite, but it wasn�t until i 
found the secret Payseur family at the very top of these companies that I really 
understood the full story. The Payseurs have gone to extreme lengths to corrupt 
government documents, such as courthouse records. They have hidden the births of 
many of their descendants, and have covered over with extreme secrecy most of 
their monetary holdings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Remember the Beatty family was an early railroad family with business ties to 
the Payseur family. Bartholomew F. Moore, who was the private attorney for years 
to President Abraham Lincoln, was a blood relative of the Beatty family. It was 
Bart Fingers Moore who co-authored the 14th amendment for the conspiracy. The 
Beatty family continually resurfaces when doing research on the conspiracy. 
Shirley MacLaine, the famous New Age leader/author is from the Beatty family. 
She credits her start to Edgar Cayce by the way, who in turn was interested in 
Blavatsky. Blavatsky was a student of the Mason Anton Mesmer, who introduced the 
world to hypnotism. Hypnotism had been secretly practiced by the Mystery 
Religions for thousands of years before Mesmer taught Blavatsky and others about 
it. Charles Beatty Alexander, who is an Illuminati <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>prince&quot;/Pilgrim 
Society member is an example of a Beatty in recent times who was within the 
elite. Quantrill, who was a famous Confederate colonel and guerrilla leader, 
whose band of raiders evolved into the Jessie James gang was married into the 
Springs (Rothschild) family</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The recent lala Madelyn Payseur Gatling Fulghum (1876-1972) was the late head 
of the Payseur family. The documentation on the above families is extensive, but 
much of the evidence that has been photocopied out of the few documents left 
intact have been destroyed since the documents were photocopied. The amount of 
tampering with official documents is incredible, and further Illustrates the 
enormous power the Rothschilds and the Payseurs (the 13th family--the Holy Blood 
line) have. The researchers who wrote Holy Blood, Holy Grail got a taste of the 
power of the 13th blood line to manipulate documents held by libraries and 
governments in Europe. The same type of thing has been happening in the United 
States. The researcher into the Satanic elite has a hard row to hoe because the 
Satanic families have tried to cover their tracks through history. They have 
also tried very hard to cover up what their financial assets are. Those 
Rothschilds who have carried on the Rothschild name have had a higher 
visibility. It is this group of Rothschilds which have gained the public�s 
attention, even though they too are very secretive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The origins of the Masonic and Rosicrucian movements lie with the medieval 
alchemists. Manly P. Hall, Freemasonry�s greatest philosopher writes,
<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>During the Middle Ages, alchemy was not only a 
philosophy and a science but also a religion. Those who rebelled against the 
religious limitations of their day concealed their philosophic teachings under 
the allegory of gold-making. In this way they preserved their personal liberty 
and were ridiculed rather than persecuted. Alchemy is a threefold art, its 
mystery well symbolized by a triangle.&quot; (The Secret Teachings of All Ages, pg 
CLIV-ul) -- Manly P Hall also states in his book on magic entitled Magic, &quot;... 
[the] pentagram. This was known to medieval alchemy as the sign of the cloven 
hoof .... (Hall.. Magic, Los Angeles, CA: Philosophical Research Soc., pg. 46) 
Quicksilver (which was one of the things the early Astor family traded in) was 
one of the primary items employed in the alchemical tra<span lang="en-gb">n</span>smutations. 
The oxide produced using quicksilver was considered magical and mystically 
identified with the god Osiris. As the reader may have already figured out, 
alchemy practiced Hermetic magic from ancient Egypt. Alchemy was really a front 
for the mystery religion of Satanic witchcraft. The leading alchemist was a 
german Richard Bauer who was alive sometime in the 14 or 15 hundreds. Richard 
Bauer is said to have been the only alchemist who was successful in transforming 
lead to gold. Whether that report is meant in an allegorical way, or some other 
way I do not know What I am trying to communicate is that the Bauer family was a 
leading alchemical family which secretly practiced Hermetic magic during the 
late Middle Ages. David�s article on the Rothschilds is meant to be an extension 
of what I have already put out on the Rothschilds. for instance my chapter 3.3 
in the Be Wise As Serpents book. Chapter 3.3 is entirely devoted to the 
Rothschilds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I chose them to write about in the book, because the family is the most 
renown of the Satanic families and the easiest to expose to people just becoming 
acquainted with what is going on. The other family which has a chapter devoted 
to it is the Russell family, which is described in chapter 1. 6. The Russell 
family has yet to be covered in this series, but was covered in the Be Wise As 
Serpents book because of their importance to the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract 
Society. I am aware of intense secret meetings that have been going on in 
Frankfurt and Moscow between World Bank officials. These secret meetings have 
been going on now for two months which gives some of the scope of their 
importance. Undoubtedly the Rothschilds are playing a role in these secret 
meetings, even while I write this. There has been a great deal of misinformation 
put out that the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers are fighting for control of 
the world. It is true that they are in intense competition in some areas. It has 
also been true that they have been in intense cooperation in many areas. One of 
the difficulties for people to sort out what is going on, is that they don�t 
know about the Satanic spiritual dimension of the Rothschilds and the 
Rockefellers. For instance, to make an analogy, if I am a minister and one of my 
brothers-in-Christ is my upline on a multi-level marketing distributorship, then 
he is my business head, but I could be the spiritual leadership that he looks up 
to. The point is that essentially all researchers trying to expose the NWO are 
drawing conclusions about occult power on the basis of business relationships, 
and it doesn�t always work. Sometimes the business boss may be in a secret 
satanic leadership position over someone else, but it may also be that both men 
are on equal footing when it comes to occult power and status within the 
Illuminati. So far I have seen only one book advertised (and I haven�t read it) 
which claims to expose the conflict between the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers 
as a sham. If It really does show this, then the book has contributed greatly 
toward helping people tear down their misunderstandings about the Illuminati 
power structure.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="4" face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><a name="Part_I_THE_HOUSE_OF_ROTHSCHILD_">Part I<span lang="en-gb">
</span>THE HOUSE OF ROTHSCHILD</a></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If one looked on the backstage of history, he would find the House of 
Rothschild. They have indebted Kings, manipulated kingdoms, created wars and 
moulded the very shape of the international world. Among the hierarchy of the 
Illuminati they are revered as a powerful satanic bloodline. They are &quot;living 
legends.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Said one biographer: &quot;In America a boy wants to become President. In Europe 
he would rather be a Rothschild.... To be �a Rothschild� is to be a modern 
Croesus, a twentieth-century Midas.&quot; They are a dynasty of enduring power; a 
&quot;magic&quot; bloodline In Satan�s Empire. We will probably never know exactly when 
occultism was introduced to the Rothschilds. Several of their ancestors have 
been rabbis, so the occultism probably came in the form of Jewish Cabalism, 
Sabbatism, or Frankism. The House of Rothschild practices gnostic-satanism (the 
Rothschilds would probably not call themselves Satanists, but by our standards 
they are, considering the sacrificial and spiritual worship involved). The truth 
is sometimes hard to tell. The stories the family weave are hard to distinguish 
from the truth. Myths are one of their best weapons, and a researcher must be 
wary. The family began in Frankfort, Germany (the city where paper money was 
popularized). The oldest known Rothschild went by the name of Uri Feibesch who 
lived in the early 16th century. His descendants lived in the House of Red 
Shield. His great, great, great, great Grandson was Moses Bauer, who lived in 
the early 18th century. The family was mostly made-up of Jewish retail traders, 
and lived in the Judengasse, or Jew�s Alley in Frankfort. Jew�s Alley was the 
product of the anti-Semitic bent in Europe, and did not have very good living 
conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most Ashkenazim Jews of that time did not use sir-names, instead they 
preferred the Chinese custom of using a symbol as the family identity. These 
symbols were sometimes used on signs outside Jewish houses as an address. Some 
Jews had taken on sir-names, to fit in, but the use of symbols was more popular. 
The early Rothschilds chose the sir-name Bauer (meaning farmer in German. Why 
would a family of retail traders call themselves Bauer? Perhaps to remain 
un-noticed). The Bauer line continues today, but in the 1700�s one man re-named 
his branch of the family after its symbol and address - the Red Shield or the 
Seal of Solomon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mayer Amschel Bauer was a well-off coin trader in Frankfort. In front of his 
house hung a sign with the family�s symbol, which was a red hexagram. The 
hexagram (also known as the Seal of Solomon, the Magden David, or the Star of 
David) is very occultic. It is used today as the symbol of Israel, but It is not
<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>Jewish.&quot; In his excellent book THE SIX-POINTED STAR, 
O.J. Graham explains that the hexagram was used in the ancient mystery 
religions. It was the symbol of Moloch, Ashtoreth, and others. In fact, the 
hexagram was used to represent Saturn, which earlier newsletters have discussed. 
The six-pointed star is considered the equivalent of the Oriental Yin-and-Yang 
symbol, which is the Luciferian concept of balancing good and evil. The symbol 
appears to have been used by King Solomon when he apostasized, and was 
thereafter called the Seal of Solomon. Later on, Jewish Cabalism (or Occultism - 
different name, same game) picked it up as a magic symbol. Through the promotion 
of the Cabalists and the Zionists it has become the symbol of Jewish identity, 
although the occult circles know better. The Bauer�s use of a hexagram as their 
family sign points to their involvement in Jewish Cabalism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In fact, the six-pointed star was so significant to them that Mayer Amschel 
Bauer decided to adopt it as his new name - Mayer Amschel Rothschild 
(Rot-schildt = Red Shield). I believe this was done to identify his family with 
occultism and the likes of Saturn or Ashtoreth (whom the Astors are named 
after). Mayer was sent to be a rabbi when he was 10, in 1753. A year and a half 
later his parents died. Mayer was brilliant and was encouraged by relatives to 
continue his studies but coin trading was his love. He left the school and when 
13 was sent to Hanover to be an apprentice at the Illuminati Oppenheimer bank. 
He worked there for 7 years, learning the ins and out of money. The big question 
is why he left the Oppenheimer bank. It was a good situation, both financially 
and socially (Hanover was less antagonistic towards the Jews than Frankfort). 
Why leave this security and head back home to an uncertain future? Because the 
future wasn�t all that uncertain. While in Hanover Mayer made the acquaintance 
of General von Estorff, a numismatist who was impressed by Mayer�s knowledge of 
the subject. In 1763 General von Estorff left Hanover and joined the Court of 
Prince William IX of Hesse-Hanau, whose territory included Frankfort. Mayer knew 
that through his connections he would be able to get some business with the 
Prince. It appears Mayer�s stay at the Oppenheimer bank was used to establish 
himself in Illuminati circles and to find a way to get close to the Illuminati 
royalty. General von Estorff was his key.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Prince William of Hesse-Hanau was tied into the Illuminati. He was the son of 
Landgrave Frederick or Hesse-Cassel, of the royal family of Hesse. Prince 
William was a Freemason, and his younger brother Karl, was according to JEWS AND 
FREEMASONS IN EUROPE, 1723-1939, �accepted as the head of all German 
Freemasons.� Members of the Hesse dynasty have been described as the leaders of 
the Strict Observance (in 1782 a Masonic Congress in Wilhelmsbad, a city in the 
Hesse province, dropped the name �Strict Observance� and changed it to 
&quot;Beneficent Knights of the Holy City&quot;). The Hesse dynasty is totally connected 
to the Illuminati. Prince William was the grandson of King George II of England. 
The Hesse-Cassel�s were one of the richest royal houses in Europe. Their income 
came mainly from the loaning-out of Hessian soldiers to foreign countries. (The 
elite loves to makes profit off of &quot;peacekeeping&quot; troops, which is exactly what 
the Hessians were called. This &quot;peacekeeping&quot; always adds up to imperialism. The 
Hessian troops were used by England in the American Revolution, in fact the 
colonial armies fought more Hessian soldiers than English. The House of 
Hesse-Cassel made a lot of money off the American Revolution.) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Another example of the Hesse-Cassel�s ties to the Illuminati is the enigmatic 
figure St. Germain, who is hailed as a New Age Messiah-figure. Many researchers 
believe that St. Germain was the son of Francis II of Transylvania. Francis II�s 
second wife was Charlotte Amalie of the House of Hesse, he married her in 1694. 
St. Germain was either her son, or the prior wife�s, this point is debated. His 
name was Leopold-George and they staged his death in 1700 to save him from the 
deadly collapse of the Transylvanian dynasty. Prince Karl of Hesse, Masonic 
leader of Germany, wrote that St. Germain had been sent down to Italy to be 
raised by the Medici family. Later on St. Germain appeared out of nowhere to 
work with the elite. There were questions as to his identity and Napoleon Ill 
had a dossier gathered on him, but the house holding the dossier was 
mysteriously destroyed in a fire. St. Germain was an alchemist and he claimed to 
have the alchemical Elixir of Life, the secret formula of immortality (which the 
Rosicrucians also claimed to have). He was a guest of William and Karl of Hesse 
in 1774, and in 1779 returned to Karl to spend the last years of his known life. 
Helena Blavatsky, cofounder of the Theosophical Society claimed that St. Germain 
was one of the Hidden Masters of Tibet who secretly controlled the world�s 
destiny. In 1930 Guy Ballard claimed that he met St. GermaIn on Mount Shasta. 
This supposed meeting led to the creation of the �I AM� movement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Hesse Dynasty has lasted clear up to the 20th century. During WWII they 
were on Hitler�s side. Prince Philip of Hesse was a messenger between Hitler and 
Mussolini. He was still alive in 1973 and was reported to be the richest prince 
in Europe. The House of Hesse is still a powerful force in Germany. In 1763 
Mayer left Hanover to build his fortune in Frankfort. His main objective was to 
become a financial agent of Prince William of Hesse-Hanau. Prince William was an 
intelligent man who loved to make money. (His passions went beyond money. His 
wife did not please him so he became an adulterer and almost every woman he 
slept with became pregnant. He fathered between 70 to 21 illegitimate children. 
His main mistress, Frau von Lindenthal, bore him 8 children and ran his 
household.) William loved to loan money at high interest rates. He was the 
perfect man to aid Mayer�s quest for riches.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mayer began bribing Prince William�s servants to become informants. At that 
time he was an antique dealer, trader, coin collector, and exchanger (the 
country was divided and as a result the separate currencies made money 
exchanging very profitable) . General von Estorff convinced Prince William of 
the value of a rare coin collection and then recommended Rothschild. Thus began 
the relationship between the Prince and the Rothschilds. Mayer would sell rare 
coins, precious stones, and antiques to the Prince at ridiculously low prices. 
Then, in 1769, after a significant amount of sales, he wrote the Prince asking 
for and receiving the designation �Crown Agent to the Prince of Hesse-Hanau&quot; (a 
great commercial advertiser. Tities and honors were important in that day, they 
opened doors). Mayer then married Gutle Schnapper, daughter of a respected 
merchant, Wolf Salomon Schnapper, in 1770. He then set up a money exchange 
bureau. His two brothers worked in this bureau with him untIl 1785 when Kalmann 
died and Moses quite. Some researchers contend that Adam Wieshaupt of the 
Bavarian Illuminati was financially supported by the Rothschilds. The Bavarian 
Illuminati was founded in 1776, and the Rothschilds were not necessarily a 
financial power at that time. I may be wrong, but I do not believe Mayer was in 
a financial position to support Wieshaupt. It is possible, though, that when, in 
1782, the headquarters of the Illuminati moved to Frankfort, that it began to be 
controlled by the Rothschilds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1785 Prince William�s father, Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel, died 
and William became the new Landgrave. This made him the richest prince in 
Germany and possibly Europe. He left the small province of Hesse-Hanau to become 
ruler in Hesse-Cassel. Around this time Wolf Schnapper, Mayer�s father-in-law, 
introduced Rothschild to Carl Buderus who was the Prince�s chief financial 
advisor. Through either coercion, friendship, or occultic ties Mayer was able to 
convince Buderus to become an agent for him. This was a big mover for Mayer. The 
Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel was to be the �steppingstone&quot; to power.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Until then Mayer had only done meagre business with William, but by 1789 
Buderus managed to get some royal bills for Rothschild to discount. This wasn�t 
much, but it was a start. Carl received a cut of the profits when he did 
William�s business through Rothschild. This was the beginning of a long 
financial relationship that would benefit both parties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mayer Amschel Bauer-Rothschild was a shrewd man, but his quick rise in social 
status shows the power of money, for Mayer was not cultured. He could never 
master the German language and so he and his family spoke a strange Yiddish 
German mixture (which benefited their secret network). He enjoyed<span lang="en-gb">
</span>discussing the medieval world and coin collecting. When it came to 
business he was ruthless and naturally adept. His occult side was well hidden. 
He was most likely a Cabalistic Jew. Although it is not known if he was a 
Freemason, he did accompany the Landgrave on several trips to Masonic lodges 
(after the two had become better friends). He had 5 daughters and 5 sons, plus 
several children that died young. He moved from his old house, the
<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>Haus zur Hinterpfann&quot;, to a new one, Green Shield, 
when he started making more money. Green Shield was a dual residency and the 
other half was occupied by the Schiff family who were to play an important role 
later on as agents of the Rothschilds. Every passage of Green Shield held hidden 
shelves and cupboards, and the backyard countinghouse�s walls had a number of 
secret shelves and a secret underground room which was connected to a neighbor�s 
house for a quick getaway if necessary (the house was built to protect Jews from 
the dangerous pogroms that would sweep Germany, it was a great place to secretly 
practice their gnostic-satanic rituals, if they were yet involved in that form 
of worship). His five sons have been called the Mayer brothers because they all 
shared that middle name: Amschel Mayer, Salomon Mayer, Nathan Mayer, Kalmann 
(Carl) Mayer, and Jacob (James) Mayer. Each son entered the family business at 
the age of 12. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The humorous side of studying an elite Illuminati family is the<span lang="en-gb">
</span>biographer�s insistence on owing the family�s ability to profit from 
circumstances as &quot;luck.� They never seem to put two and two together. Many of 
these circumstances happened by design. They always say things like �... the 
infant opportunity seemed to be the child of coincidence.&quot; They never attribute 
a family�s wealth to well planned extortion, cheating, or thievery, which is 
exactly how families like the Rothschilds attain their riches. The French 
Revolution is an example.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Illuminati fuelled French Revolution got under way in the 1790�s, and 
Prince William began to get nervous. He was afraid the revolutionary riots would 
reach Germany and he would lose his gold. So he invested his money in a 
magnificent new palace called Wilhelmshoe, which was built from 1791 to 1798. 
Although the French Revolution frightened William it was a delight for Mayer. 
The war helped his sales. When the French ended up pitted against the Holy Roman 
Empire, the prices of imported goods skyrocketed, and importing goods from 
England was a Rothschild specialty. In fact Mayer�s English trade helped him 
secure a deal with the Landgrave (through Buderus, of course) in which he became 
a middleman in England�s payments for the hire of Hessian soldiers. �...every 
ill wind of the 1790�s seemed to blow good to the Rothschilds.&quot; The winds were 
so good that by the end of the decade they were established as a rich and 
independent family. In 1800 they were the 11th richest family in Frankfort�s Jew 
Alley (not counting the wealth in proxy). Around the turn of the century Mayer 
decided to send his most clever son, Nathan to England to establish another 
Rothschild House. The family tells a silly story about Nathan leaving for 
England to best an annoying English cotton trader, but I believe that Nathan was 
sent by Mayer with a specific purpose - to establish power with the Rothschild 
network in that country. Nathan arrived in England with no knowledge of the 
language but a great amount of money. He would soon be the most powerful man in 
Europe. Many more profitable events occurred at the turn of the century. Many of 
these events revolve around the Rothschild infiltration of the Thurn and Taxis 
postal system. The House of Thurn and Taxis was of the Black Nobility. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1516 Holy Roman Emperor Maximilion I (of the Merovinglan bloodline and 
husband of a member of the Black Nobility)<span lang="en-gb"> </span>
commissioned the House to create a mounted postal service between Vienna and 
Brussels. The service eventually included all of Central Europe. The head office 
of the system was in Frankfort, which was rather convenient for Mayer who 
proceeded to do business with them. His relationship with Thurn and Taxis became 
so close that the service began to inform him of any pertinent Information found 
among the letters (that they had a habit of covertly reading). This mail fraud 
system was also used by the Emperor Francis to keep abreast of his enemies. 
While Mayer was receiving stolen news from Thurn and Taxis he was busy setting 
up his own postal service so that no-one could secretly discover his dealings. 
This system was eventually so effective that the Rothschilds became the best and 
fastest informed individuals in the world. The system was so good that many 
prominent men began to send their letters through the Rothschilds, who of 
course, always snuck a peak at the contents. The business with Thurn and Taxis 
helped Mayer receive the title <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>Imperial Crown Agent&quot; 
in 1800. This title served as a passport that allowed him to travel throughout 
the Holy Roman Empire. It also provided the right to bear arms, and it freed him 
from having to pay the taxes and obligations upon the Jews of that period. Mayer 
began to get even more titles, including one from the German Order of St. John. 
His sons Amschel and Salomon were also busy getting various titles. In 1801 they 
became crown agents of the Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel. All these titles 
were wonderful, but most important was the Landgrave�s. The Landgrave was the 
richest Prince in Europe and the Rothschilds were determined to take advantage 
of his wealth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The relationship with the Landgrave improved greatly in 1803. A Danish King, 
and cousin of William, asked the Prince for loans but William declined because 
he did not want anyone to know how rich he had become. Rothschild learned about 
it and through Buderus, proposed lending the money anonymously. William thought 
the idea was splendid. The loan was sent through Mayer and a Hamburg Jew. The 
interests were paid to Rothschild who, after taking commission, forwarded the 
money to the Landgrave. The event was a great triumph, after 36 years, Mayer had 
finally done a significant job for the Prince. Six more Landgrave loans to 
Denmark were negotiated by Rothschild. Many more loans ensued (although they 
required some teeth pulling on Buderus� part), Including loans to the Order of 
St. John. This negotiating of the Landgrave�s loans greatly increased the 
reputation of the House of Rothschild.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">By this time Napoleon had come to power in France. This caused a distress in 
Europe, but brought great profits to the House of Rothschild. As one biographer 
put it &quot;Napoleon seemed bent on Improving the Rothschild�s lot in life.&quot; Even 
though Napoleon was not purposely doing It, the conditions he created were of 
great benefit. Napoleon tried to get the Landgrave as his ally, but Prince 
William squirmed and politely as possible refused. William�s goal was to wait 
until the winning side in the Napoleonic conflict was clear so that he could 
join without any risks. The pressure of the situation gave the Landgrave a very 
bad temper. By this time half the crown heads of Europe were in his debt. 
Napoleon grew tired of the Landgrave�s games. His troops Invaded Germany and the 
province of Hesse to &quot;remove the House of Hesse-Cassel from rulership and to 
strike It out of the list of powers.&quot; Wllhelmshoe became frantic as William 
attempted to hide his riches. After the scramble to conceal his wealth he fled 
the province and went to live in exile in Denmark. The French immediately found 
most of his treasures. Buderus and Mayer had to act fast to preserve the wealth 
of the Landgrave. Some of the valuables had already been sold.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">They quickly bribed a French General, Lagrange, who turned over 42 trunks to 
Hessian officials and lied to Napoleon about the Prince�s true wealth. 
Lagrange�s deceptive act was eventually discovered and he was dismissed, but 
much of the wealth was preserved. During the frantic moments before 
Hesse-Cassel�s Invasion, the Landgrave gave Buderus the right to collect the 
Interest payments due from Holy Roman Emperor Francis. Buderus eventually 
transferred this right to the Rothschilds. Mayer began doing the Landgrave�s 
business behind Napoleon�s back. These secret dealings were greatly boosted by 
the man Napoleon appointed to rule the area -Karl von Dalberg. Dalberg was a 
friend of Mayer and Buderns and had done business with them (his connection to 
them may have also been occult). Napoleon made Dalberg Primate of the new 
Confederation of the Rhine, which included Frankfort. As ruler of the region 
Dalberg protected the Rothschilds from being exposed as traders of contraband 
and as agents of the House of Hesse-Cassel. When the French cut off trade with 
England prices on Imports soared. The Rothschilds smuggled goods in and made 
large profits, with Dalberg keeping guard. &quot;It was certainly most remarkable,&quot; 
said one biographer. &quot;That the Archbishop and Lord of the Confederation of the 
Rhine, who ruled over sixteen German princes, and stood so high in Napoleon�s 
favor, should have shown so much good-will to the Jewish Mayer Amschel 
Rothschild at Frankfort, who, although now a rich man, had no aim to move in 
high and influential circles.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Despite Dalberg�s protection Mayer kept two sets of books, one inspectable 
and the other secret. By 1807 Buderus, as proxy for the Landgrave, was almost 
exclusively using the Rothschilds for Hesse-Cassel business. Mayer himself would 
visit the Prince in exile, but since he was getting old he soon had to give up 
these trips and sent his sons on the journeys. The House of Rothschild was 
collecting the income of the wealthiest prince in Europe less than half a 
century after Mayer had begun building his fortune! The satanic House of 
Rothschild�s Illuminati dealings at this time are well exemplified by their 
involvement with the second Tugenbund League. The first Tugenbund League (or 
Virtue League) was formed in 1786 as a kind of sex society.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The group would meet at Henrietta Herz�s home (her husband was an Illuminati 
Jew who was the disciple of the powerful occultist Moses Mendelssohn). Many 
Illuminists attended this &quot;Virtue&quot; League. A number of young Jewish women whose 
husbands were always away on business would come to the Herz�s house to 
participate in the immorality (two members were daughters of Moses Mendelssohn). 
Frequenters of this �salon&quot; included revolutionary Freemason M<span lang="en-gb">i</span>rabeau, 
William von Humbolt, and Frederick von Gentz who was to become an important 
Rothschild agent. Later on, I will discuss Gentz in further detail. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1807 the second Tugenbund League was formed. This League pursued 
�moral-scientific&quot; and political aims. The main aim being the deliverance of 
Germany from French occupation. The League was formed by Baron von Stein who was 
its principle &quot;protector.&quot; Thomas Frost wrote in SECRET SOCIETIES OF THE 
EUROPEAN REVOLUTION that �The Initiations [into the second Tugendbund] 
multiplied rapidly, and the League soon numbered in its ranks most of the 
Councillors of State, many officers of the army, and a considerable number of 
the professors of literature and science.... A central directorate at Berlin, 
presided over by Stein, had the supreme control of the movement, and exercised, 
through provincial committees, an authority all the more potent from emanating 
from an unknown source, and which was obeyed as implicitiy as the decrees of 
Emperor or King.� The Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel held an important 
position in the second Tugendbund. Buderus was also involved. It appears the 
Rothschilds were members and they were ,,go-betweens for the [Landgrave�s] 
correspondence on this matter, and made payments in favor of the Tugendbund.&quot; 
This put Mayer Rothschild at the head of the propaganda system against Napoleon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Napoleon tried to suppress Tugundbund but it went underground, concealing 
itself under the protection of the English Masonic Lodge at Hanover, It assisted 
many anti-Napoleon causes physically and financially. Tugendbund was eventually 
dissolved, but many of its members moved on to other Masonic<span lang="en-gb">
</span>societies such as the �Black Knights,� �The Knights of the Queen of 
Prussia,&quot; and �The Concordists.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1818 the second Tugundbund was revived as the Burschenschaft (Association 
of Boys or Fellows). The Burschenschaft was a revolutionary group of students 
who introduced martial exercises into the universities. The Burschenschaft 
eventually fell apart. After a few years the exiled Landgrave came to totally 
trust the Rothschilds. �...[Prince William] got more and more accustomed to 
following [Mayer] Rothschild�s advice, and scarcely took any important financial 
step without consulting him.� This princely steppingstone was working out 
perfectly. It was paving the way towards Rothschild financial freedom. Mayer 
wanted to become a creditor, and his goal was soon achieved. In 1810 the 
Rothschild�s firm became �Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Sons&quot; (Nathan was not a 
public partner of this firm). That same year Mayer loaned his own money to 
Denmark and when Dalberg took out a big loan to go to the baptism of Napoleon�s 
son, the financial security of the Frankfort bank was set in stone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The House of Rothschild needed a new steppingstone. The old one, the 
Landgrave, would not be discarded, but they needed a younger, more political man 
who could be their key to controlling Europe. That man was Prince Clemens 
Metternich who in 1809 became the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs. He 
became the leading opposer of Napoleon, and the Landgrave moved in his exile to 
Austria, hoping the powerful up-start would get Hesse back. So the Rothschild 
network increased its operations in Austria - the land of the Hapsburgs. Around 
this time Mayer Amschel Bauer-Rothschild got sick. Before his death he wrote a 
Will that<span lang="en-gb"> </span>would dictate the structure of the 
Rothschilds. Although the exact content�s of Mayer�s Will have been kept secret, 
one edict is clear. It completely excluded the daughters and their husbands and 
heirs from the business, and all knowledge of it. The Will totally exalted the 
importance of the family circle. On Sept. 19, 1812 Mayer died. A bogus legend 
about his death maintains that his five sons gathered around his deathbed and he 
split Europe between them. Only Amschel and Carl were in Frankfort when he died. 
Nathan was in England, and Salomon and James were on the road (the brothers were 
constantly traveling).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="THE_FIVE_WIZARDS�_">THE &quot;FIVE WIZARDS�</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When Mayer died, headship over the family fell on Nathan Rothschild of 
England. Even though Nathan was not the oldest, the 5 brothers had voted 
unanimously that he was the most capable to lead them. Nathan was an 
intelligent, uneducated, self-absorbed jerk. Though he was an impolite, 
foul-mouthed man (�...he could swear like a trooper.�) his money got him into 
the high society of England. His cold view on life and power is seen in his 
response to an English Major who was being sentimental about the horrible deaths 
of the large number of soldiers that had died in the war. �Well,� said 
Rothschild. �If they had not all died, Major, you presumably would still be a 
drummer.� There is a story that says one of Nathan�s sons asked him how many 
nations there were in the world and Nathan replied: �There are only two you need 
to bother about. There is the mishpoche [Yiddish for family] and there are the 
others.� This story may be false, but the attitude is real.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Nathan first settled in Manchester, England, the center of cloth 
manufacturing. In 1804 he moved to London. As his wealth and his reputation 
began to grow he was able to marry Hannah Cohen. The Cohens were a wealthy 
Jewish family from Amsterdam, and Hannah�s father, Salomon Cohen was a respected 
merchant in London. Nathan served with him as Warden of the Great Synagogue (the 
Rothschilds relationship to the Jews will be discussed later on in this 
article). Hannah�s sister, Judith, married the powerful Jewish Freemason Moses 
Montefiore (the Montefiore�s were of &quot;ancient&quot; and extremely �aristocratic 
Jewish stock�, probably another Cabalistic family), who was friends with Nathan 
(Nathan�s sister Henrietta married a Montefiore, so did his second son, Anthony, 
and his brother, Salomon�s great grandson, Aiphonse married a Sebag-Montefiore 
in 1911). Nathan�s social life revolved around the Cohens.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Nathan was a Freemason. He was a member of London�s Lodge of Emulation. 
Nathan�s accumulation of wealth was incredible. His money-making exploits were 
unbelievable. He was smuggling English goods past the French blockade during the 
Napoleonic conflict, and making great profits. This smuggling required an agent 
in Paris, so Mayer, through his Dalberg connections, got his son James a 
passport and James went to live in Paris. A large amount of the Landgrave�s 
money was sent to Nathan in England, on the advice of Buderus, for the purpose 
of buying stock. But Nathan, as he and Buderus had planned, used the money as 
capitol for other ventures. When the exiled Landgrave began asking for a 
proof-of-purchase, Buderus and the Rothschild brothers had to come up with all 
sorts of excuses to protect Nathan�s thievery. Eventually the Landgrave demanded 
to see receipts, so Nathan quickly bought some stock (the Landgrave had told him 
to buy the stocks at 72, but their price when be ended up buying them was 62, 
Nathan pocketed the savings) and they snuck the receipts through the French 
blockade to the exiled Prince. The Landgrave was satisfied, he had no idea what 
had really been done with his money. Nathan began making connections in the 
British government. Probably his greatest early connection was to the Treasury 
official John Herries. Herries aided Nathan�s rise to power in every way 
possible. He became an intimate friend or Nathan�s and eventually a proxy for 
Rothschild in the British government. Their dealings were kept secret and the 
public had no idea as to the enormity of Nathan�s power. The most incredible 
example of</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Nathan�s devious schemes is a job he would later describe as the best 
business he had ever done. Through Nathan�s connections in the treasury he 
learned of the plight of the English army in Spain. The Duke of Wellington (soon 
to become Nathan�s friend) had British troops in Spain ready to attack France, 
only they lacked one thing - hard cash (the army�s financiers would not take 
paper money), but the government was very short on gold at the time. Nathan knew 
how to profit from this situation. The East India Company was trying to sell 
gold that, of coarse, the government wanted to buy, but the price was so high 
that officials decided to wait until it dropped. Nathan stepped in and bought up 
the gold (using some of the Landgraves money as well as his own). He then 
proceed to raise the price. When the officials realized the price wouldn�t drop 
they bought the gold and Nathan made a great profit. But the deal didn�t stop 
there. Nathan offered to deliver the gold to Wellington (this was a heavy 
responsibility because of the French blockade).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hemes went to bat and got Rothschild the job. Nathan�s plan was incredible, 
one biographer said his scheme was �comparable to burglary in broad daylight.� 
Nathan�s brother, James went to Napoleon�s government and told them that Nathan 
would be importing gold into France and that the British government was upset at 
the move because it would financially hurt England. Napoleon�s government 
believed his lie and any French police who might have uncovered the plot were 
bribed. So Nathan was able to ship the gold to Paris with the approval of both 
the English and French governments. In Paris the gold was exchanged in French 
banking firms for cash Wellington could use, and then the Rothschild network 
carried the money into Spain as France allowed Nathan to fund the war against 
itself. Eventually some French officials grew suspicious, but Napoleon ignored 
their reports (why?). The plan went smoothly even though the same officials 
secretly watched James Rothschild and his brother Carl (who was in on the plot). 
Wellington eventually defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. The Wellington smuggle was 
one of the greatest scams in history! In order to better understand the 
Rothschild�s involvement in the defeat of Napoleon we must look at the role 
played by the Rothschild�s second steppingstone - Metternich. Metternich was the 
Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and he led the opposition against Napoleon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Metternich was a fierce enemy of the revolutionary fires that were spreading 
through Europe. The Rothschild�s got to him through a member of the first 
Tugendbund (the sexual one), Frederick von Gentz. Gentz was Metternich�s 
right-hand man. Metternich was not financially minded and he relied on Gentz�s 
advise concerning economics (Gentz�s ability to handie his private finances was 
terrible, but he had a knack for political economy). John Herries brought Gentz 
and the Rothschilds together. The family proceeded to bribe the man into their 
service. Gentz is an interesting character. He was a Freemason so he was 
probably occultic. His involvement in the first Tugendbund League points to 
Immorality. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Another interesting fact is that I found most of his visits to the 
Rothschilds occurred on occultic<span lang="en-gb"> </span>holidays, such as 
Winter Solstice. This may be a coincidence, but it is interesting non-the-less. 
Gentz called the Rothschilds �a special species plantarum with its own 
characteristics.� Gentz steadily brought Metternich into the Rothschild�s web. 
By at least 1814 Metternich was an ally of the House of Rothschild. His goal was 
to protect the power of the old aristocracy. His plan was simply to extinguish 
revolution, and he began with Napoleon. Austria declared war on France and 
allied Itself with Russia. England Joined them to form a powerful coalition 
against Napoleon. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The battle of Waterloo in 1815 decided the war. Metternich had led Europe to 
victory with the help of Nathan�s delivery network which funded the overthrow. 
The victory made Metternich the most powerful man in Europe. Due to his speedy 
courier system, Nathan knew of the outcome of the Waterloo battle before the 
news reached any other Englander. A persistent myth is that he made the bulk of 
his fortune by manipulating the stock exchange with this knowledge. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">First of all, he did manipulate the market, but he already had a fortune, 
this only added to It. Second of all, he might not have even made a significant 
profit (the issue is complicated and debatable. I will not go into it). Two 
years before his defeat, Napoleon had pulled out of Germany. In 1813 the 
Landgrave William of Hesse-Cassel returned to his province. Said one biographer: 
�Earlier it had been the Rothschilds who had asked for favors, now it was the 
(Landgrave] and Buderus who tried to maintain a close connection.� In 1818 
Buderus died. By 1815 Nathan controlled England�s finance. He did a large amount 
of direct business with the English treasury. John Hemes was allowing deals that 
would hurt England but fill the pockets of the House of<span lang="en-gb">
</span>Rothschild. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The following quote by one of Nathan�s contemporaries describes his eerie 
countenance: �Eyes are usually called windows of the soul. But in Rothschild�s 
case you would conclude that the windows are false ones, or that there was no 
soul to look out them. There comes not one pencil of light from the interior, 
neither is there any gleam of that which comes from without reflected in any 
direction. The whole puts you in mind of an empty skin, and you wonder why it 
stands upright without at least something in it. By and by another figure comes 
up to it. It then steps two paces aside, and the most inquisitive glance that 
you ever saw, and a glance more inquisitive than you would have thought of, is 
drawn out of the fixed and leaden eyes, as if one were drawing a sword from a 
scabbard...�<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp; </span>This description is disturbingly similar 
to either MPD or demonic possession. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A Prussian official said that Rothschild had �an incredible influence upon 
all financial affairs here in London. It is widely stated ... that he entirely 
regulates the rate of exchange in the City. His power as a banker is enormous.� 
�When Nathan ... (made] a fuss, the Bank of England trembled.� Once he tried to 
cash a check from his brother Amschel at the Bank, but the Bank refused saying 
it cashed only its own notes. Nathan�s volcano-like temper exploded. The next 
morning he and nine of his clerks arrived at the Bank and began exchanging bank 
notes for gold. In one day he had reduced the Bank�s gold reserves by a 
substantial amount. The next day he and his clerks arrived with more bank notes. 
A Bank executive nervously asked how long he intended to keep this up. Nathan 
replied something to the effect of �The Bank of England refused to take
<span lang="en-gb">m</span>y bills, so I will not keep theirs.� </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A meeting was quickly called and they decided that from then on the Bank of 
England would be pleased to cash any Rothschild check Nathan�s firm was named 
N.M. Rothschild and Sons. The firm met in the New Court building and for the 
sake of brevity will be referred to as New Court. New Court was so powerful that 
it even became a gold broker for the Bank of England (whose price I believe they 
still fix at will, though I may be wrong). He also founded the Alliance 
Insurance Company in England. The Illuminati has the Luciferian belief system 
that one�s evil acts must be balanced by one�s good acts. This belief system has 
led to the philanthropy of the truly evil elite (although much of this 
,,charity&quot; money goes to fund their objectives).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Nathan hated the common masses but his duty called. �Almoners, particularly 
those acting on behalf of the poor Jews of London, reported that they got 
thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of pounds out of Rothschild, but hardly a 
word and never a courtesy.� Nathan did not enjoy charity. He was good friends 
with Thomas Buxton, the anti-slavery leader. The famous musicians Mendelssohn 
and Rossini taught his daughter to play the harp. When Mayer died in 1812, his 
oldest son Amschel took over the Frankfort firm. Although Amschel was not the 
head of the family, he was its spokesman to the aristocracy. He was the one who 
would apply for the honours and titles for his brothers. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">He has been described as a crotchety worrier who clung to the past. He was 
socially odd, yet held great dinners that were the talk of the elite. Religion 
was a big part of his life, to the point of being called <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>monkish.&quot; 
Even though he lived on a grand scale Amschel had no joy. Much of this distress 
came from the fact that he had failed to have any children. After Napoleon 
exited Germany a German Confederation was set up, of which Amschel became the 
treasurer. In a sense this made him the first finance minister of the Prussian 
Empire which was created by the Confederation. Amschel�s sorrow over his lack of 
children led him to pick prominent young men to treat as his sons. One such man 
was Otto von Bismark, who would later become the Iron Chancellor of Germany. 
Amschel was the protector of his mother Gutle, who was the Matriarch of the 
family. No one could receive full admission into the House of Rothschild by 
marriage unless she approved. Gutie smiled little and had a harsh tongue. One 
legend has it that a neighbor asked her whether there was to be peace or war. 
,,War?&quot; Gutle replied. &quot;Nonsense. My boys won�t let them.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Saloman was the second oldest son of Mayer. Along with the other brothers he 
was constantly travelling through Europe. What separated him from his brothers 
was his gift of diplomacy. He was more stately and complimentary than the 
others. Said one banker of Salomon: &quot;Nobody leaves him without being comforted.&quot; 
in other words he knew how to kiss up. It was this fact that led the brothers to 
send him to Vienna, Austria to establish a relationship with the painfully 
aristocratic Hapsburgs and with vain Metternich. Although the Rothschilds had 
attempted to enter a close business relationship with the Hapsburgs and Austria, 
the Austrian royalty kept putting them off. Then Salomon came along. He rode in 
on a wave of new found Rothschild power. Their name had become famous. One 
person described it as the &quot;two magic syllables.&quot; The brothers had become, as 
one biographer put it, &quot;the Archdemons of Progress.&quot; Salomon began to vie for 
Austrian ties through Gentz and Metternich. Eventually Salomon�s diplomacy, 
Metternich�s lobbying, and the below-cost method earlier used on the Landgrave 
broke down the wall between the House of Rothschild and the Illuminati 
Hapsburgs. Austria began to employ the Rothschilds on a regular basis. Salomon 
moved into Vienna and bought a Hotel and a house. Salomon knew how to play 
Metternich like a piano. He knew the right thing to say at the right time. He 
knew Metternich�s quirks and prejudices, such as his vanity which Salomon easily 
manipulated. Pretty soon Metternich and Salomon became close friends. The same 
goes for Metternich�s right-hand man, Gentz. Gentz and Salomon were 
&quot;inseparable.&quot; Salomon was also a Freemason. It came to the point where Austria 
became so controlled by the Rothschilds that the government did not want to 
refuse the brothers anything. In 1816 Amschel, Salomon, Carl, and James received 
a title of nobility from the Hapsburgs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1818 the Aix-la-Chapelle Congress met to discuss the future of Europe. 
Salomon, Carl, Metternich, and Gentz all attended this Congress. It was here 
that Metternich first met the Rothschilds. Gentz kept the minutes of the 
Congress, he was called the &quot;Secretary of Europe.&quot; A Rothschild scheme at this 
Congress totally shook the financial institutions of Europe, there was no 
denying the power of the Rothschilds. &quot;The divine right of kings had been 
overthrown by the divine right of money..&quot; At Aix-la-Chapelle the Rothschilds 
widened their circle of influence in the Illuminati. Salomon set up a new firm 
in Vienna. He financially supported Metternich�s fight against revolution. 
Metternich had established the &quot;Vienna System&quot; which controlled Europe after 
Napoleon�s defeat. The Austrian leader began doing what the elite love to do - 
sending &quot;peacekeeping&quot; troops Into conflIcts. 1814-1848 has been described as 
&quot;The Age of Metternich&quot;, but since the Rothschilds financed and controlled him 
it would be more accurate to call it &quot;The Age of the House of Rothschild.&quot; The 
Order of Vladimir was conferred upon Salomon for his work with Russia. 
Gioacchino Rossini, the Italian opera composer who wrote Cinderella and the 
William Tell overture became a good friend of both Salomon and his brother 
James.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1822, he, Metternich, Gentz, James, and Cari attended the Verona Congress. 
This Congress was totally manipulated by the Rothschilds. They profited 
Immensely by its outcome. Salomon financed the first important Central European 
railways. The Austrians began saying that they had an Emperor Ferdinand and a 
King Salomon. When it came to Austrian finances Salomon got the last word. The 
people would show up at his office and beg for a royal &quot;laying on of hands.&quot; He 
only had to touch a bond or a stock, and its owner went away certain of its 
rise. U<span lang="en-gb">nli</span>ke the other Rothschilds he gave immense 
charity donations. He bought the huge coal and iron works of Vitkovitz. In 1843 
he received permission to purchase inheritable agricultural real estate (many 
people were against Jews buying private property), and he proceeded to buy up 
large amounts of land. He obtained the lease of Austria�s mercury mines. This 
and the only other mercury deposit in Spain were controlled by the Rothschilds, 
creating a world monopoly on a key metal. Salomon was incredibly powerful.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The next son, Cart was the family�s chief courier. He was the least 
intelligent of all the brothers. He was awkward when he spoke and he had a nasty 
temper. One biographer described him as &quot;punchy&quot;. In 1821 Carl was sent to 
Naples, Italy to oversee loans there that were meant to finance Metternich�s 
forces who had arrived to quell a rebellion. While in Italy the Rothschild 
&quot;mantle&quot; came upon Carl and he made a series of ingenious deals with the Italian 
government that forced Naples to pay for its own occupation. He also helped 
Luigi de Medici of the Black Nobility to re-gain his position as finance 
minister of Naples, and later did business with the powerful man. Due to his 
success it was decided that he would stay in Naples and set up his own bank. He 
became financier to the court, the &quot;financial overlord of Italy.&quot; Carl &quot;...wound 
the Italian peninsula around his hand.&quot; He did business with the Vatican, and 
when Pope Gregory XVI received him by giving him his hand rather than the 
customary toe to kiss, people realized the extent of his power. The Pope 
conferred upon him the Order of St. George.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It appears that in Italy Carl became a leader of Carbonarism. After the 
Bavarian Illuminati was exposed, Carbonarism (or the Alta Vendita) became the 
major European occult power. Carl�s leadership in this group is very 
significant. In 1818 a secret Alta Vendita document, that Cari had participated 
in preparing, was sent to the headquarters of Masonry. A copy of this document 
was lost, and the Masons got very upset, and offered rewards for the return of 
this copy. The title of the document translates &quot;Permanent Instructions, or 
Practical Code of Rules; Guide for the Heads of the Highest Grades of 
Freemasonry. &quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Last, but absolutely not least, was the youngest son, James. During the 
Napoleonic conflict James had spent his time between London and Paris, 
supporting the Rothschild�s network of illegal trade with England. After the 
Wellington smuggle and the defeat of Napoleon, James became an established 
figure in France. He founded a bank there and began the French branch of the 
Rothschild family. James was a 33 degree Scottish Rite Mason. At this time the 
French House<span lang="en-gb"> </span>was the center of operations for the 
Rothschilds. Even though successive revolutions would de-throne ruler after 
ruler, Rothschild power kept the family in control. James was good friends with 
the leading minister of the Bourbon court, Count de Villele, and he &quot;owned&quot; King 
Louis Philippe. He also secretly funded Spanish revolutionaries (his agent in 
Madrid was Monsieur Belin). </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">James yearned for social status. The pursuit of which was second only to 
money. He had g<span lang="en-gb">r</span>own so powerful that the French 
exchange was deeply affected by all his decisions. Like his brother, Salomon, he 
pioneered the railroad business in France. He also bought the great Lafite 
vineyards. His bank, de Rothschild Freres was in a league all its own. No one in 
France could even wish to be as powerful as James. As Salomon had, James 
received the Order of Vladimir for his work with the Russian dynasty. He also 
became a member of the Societe de Antiquites. In the Rothschild tradition (as<span lang="en-gb">
</span>constituted by Mayer�s Will) of trying to keep everything within the 
family James married his niece, Betty Rothschild, the daughter of Salomon. The 
Rothschilds main advantage was their incredible courier system. It kept the 5 
Houses connected. In fact, the Hapsburgs used this system quite often. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">All evidence points to the Rothschild brothers being very powerful within 
Freemasonry. They were one of the leading families in occultism at that time in 
Europe. Many prominent Masons of their day praised the brothers. In 1820, due to 
Metternich�s lobbying, Nathan was made Austrian consul in London, and two years 
later he was made consul-general. James was also made an Austrian consul in 
Paris. Metternich�s promptings also provided something else very important to 
the family; in 1822 all the brothers<span lang="en-gb"> </span>and their 
descendants of either sex were made Barons. This established social position for 
the Rothschilds. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Gentz-Metternich team was very beneficial to the House of Rothschild. By 
this time a few papers had run some upsetting articles about the family. Salomon 
asked Gentz to censure any more unkind reports and he also commissioned the 
Illuminist to write a bogus biography on the family that would portray them in a 
good light. Gentz, now called the &quot;Pen of Europe&quot;, proceeded to write legends 
for the Rothschilds, and the family fully encouraged the propaganda in their 
social circles. The brothers had a system (based on Mayer�s Will) where only 
family members were partners or owners of the banks. This system is still in use 
today. The Rothschild banks bought everything up, from mining corporations to 
national debts. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">For instance, New Court has been controlling Brazil�s debts since 1824. In 
1836 Nathan Rothschild, head of the House of Rothschild, died (he may have been 
poisoned). The headship was passed on to his younger brother, James, by a vote 
of all the brothers. In 1830 the signs of masonic-fueled revolution began to 
appear again. Metternich�s &quot;peace of the world&quot; (they always call imperialism
<span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>peace&quot;) was being threatened. A new king was set up 
in France, the House of Orange was dethroned in the Netherlands. The fires of 
revolution were spreading through the Masonic network and Metternich began to 
lose his grip on Europe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Revolution of 1848 in France de-throned yet another royal house. James 
went along with the Masonic agenda and financed this revolution, even though he 
was a friend of the court. The revolution marked the end of Metternich�s &quot;Age&quot; 
and that same year insurrectors chased him and Salomon out of Austria. Neither 
returned, but a Vienna House had already been established, others would carry it 
on, under the direction of Salomon�s son, Anselm. Metternich�s descendants are 
still close to the House of Rothschild. After this the power of the Rothschilds 
weakened. By 1855 all five brothers were dead except James. Napoleon III was now 
in power in France and his advisors were the enemies of James. But Rothschild 
ingenuity came through again when James got Napoleon <span lang="en-gb">III</span> 
to marry a Rothschild agent. James died in I 868 and the family headship went to 
Alphonse, his son.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FF0000"><b><a name="THE_NEW_TRINITY_">&quot;THE NEW TRINITY&quot;</a></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Three cousins now ran the show - Alphonse of the French House, 
Lionel of the 
English House and Anselm of the Vienna House - &quot;the new trinity&quot;. The three 
banned together to destroy an enemy bank, French Credit Mobilier. Anselm set up 
a new firm, Creditanstalt in Vienna to combat the French bank. With the help of 
Lionel and Alphonse he attacked Credit Mobilier until it collapsed. The new head 
of the House of Rothschild was Baron Alphonse de Rothschild. Alphonse was a 
suave, socially elite man. After the rail of France�s Credit Mobilier Napoleon
<span lang="en-gb">III</span> stepped onto the Rothschild bandwagon. Alphonse 
was powerful, he had &quot;access&quot; to men like Napoleon III and Bismarck of Prussia. 
The Illuminati decided to get rid of Napoleon <span lang="en-gb">III</span> , so 
English Prime Minister Gladstone (friend of the Rothschilds) set things up so 
that Prussia and France would go to war. Napoleon <span lang="en-gb">III</span> 
proceeded to attack Prussia and Bismarck responded in a furry, defeating France 
and banishing Napoleon III from the throne. The war indemnities were paid to 
Bismarck (who had a dislike for Alphonse, despite his connections to the family) 
through the Rothschilds. Alphonse�s brother, Edmond, was the one who helped 
create Israel (this will be discussed further on in the article). </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Alphonse married another<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Rothschild, but his love 
for her was not very strong. The Comtesse de Castiglione was a beautiful woman 
who was a Marylin Monroe of her day. She was the mistress of Alphonse, his 
brother Gustave Rothschild (whose daughter married a Sassoon), and Napoleon III. 
Anselm Rothschild of the Vienna House was a shrewd playboy. He destroyed Credit 
Mobilier with Creditanstalt, and in 1861 he became a member of the Austrian 
Imperial House of Lords.<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp; </span>Anselm had many mistresses 
and his wife left him because of his adultery. He died in 1874. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Lionel Rothschild of the English House inherited New Court. He financed 
England�s Crimean War, Cecil Rhodes� South African kingdom, vast copper and 
nitrate mines, and the purchase of the Suez Canal. Lionel�s younger brother, 
Anthony was knighted by the Queen. Another brother, Nathaniel, bought the 
renowned Mouton vineyards near Bordeaux. Lionel was a good friend of Prime 
Ministers Disraeli (who was controlled by Rothschild money) and Gladstone. He 
also probably paid for Lord John Russell�s election as Prime Minister. Lord 
Tennyson (whose poems are used in programming) attended his house parties. 
Lionel has been described as &quot;grouchy&quot; and &quot;crotchety.&quot; 
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1858, Lionel became the first Jew in House of Commons. After eleven tries, 
the British Parliament gave in and allowed Rothschild to take his seat. Not a 
single significant political move by Lionel was recorded during his stay in 
Parliament. He was a member for 15 years. in 1879 he died. After Amschel of the 
House of Frankfort died without an heir, two of Carl of Italy�s sons came to 
take over the business. But they also remained heirless, bearing only daughters. 
When the last brother died in 1901, the Frankfort bank was liquidated (I believe 
they did not try to continue the original bank because they knew that Germany 
was about to be caught up in the turmoil of the world wars, they eventually set 
up another Frankfort bank after Germany�s turmoil).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The House of Italy ended the same way. The one son of Carl who had stayed in 
Naples produced only daughters, and when Geribaldi�s Red Shirts unified Italy 
this remaining son (out of character for a Rothschild) chose not to accommodate 
the new powers and moved to France. Thus ended the Italian branch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This subject is so massive that it will only be touched on. In 1837 August 
Belmont came to the U.S., during the Panic of 1837. August Belmont appears to 
have been a Rothschild proxy. Belmont bought up government bonds in this Panic 
and his success eventually led him to the White House where he became the 
&quot;financial advisor to the President of the United States&quot;. His policies helped 
pit the North against the South for the Civil War. Judah P. Benjamin, who 
according to A. Ralph Epperson was the C<span lang="en-gb">ivil</span> War 
campaign strategist for the House of Rothschild held many key positions in the 
Confederacy. He was apparently connected to John Wilkes Booth. J.P. Morgan has 
been called a Rothschild agent. His father was one of the many elite who made 
their fortunes by shipping supplies past the North�s blockade and into the 
Confederacy. J.P. was a major supporter of an American central bank 
(Interestingly enough, he is reported to be related to Alexander Hamilton). 
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1869, J.P. Morgan went to the House of England and formed Northern 
Securities as an agent for New Court in the U.S. Then, in 1907 J.P. 
Morganshuttled back and forth between London and Paris, presumably getting 
orders from the Rothschilds. He returned to America and instigated the Panic of 
1907, which led to the <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>need&quot; for a central bank. 
Another man who appears to be connected to the Rothschilds was Thomas House, who 
also made his fortune slipping supplies past the North and into the South. His 
son, Colonel Edward M. House was one of the main Illuminati figures to control 
America during the early 20th Century.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rothschild relationship to the Jews is deceiving. The family stance is 
publicized as &quot;pro-Jewish&quot;, and they have given abundant charity to Jewish 
causes. But their support of the Jewish race has, in most cases, been used for 
the sole purpose of controlling the direction and profiting from the Jews. The 
Rothschilds have been described as the royal family of the Jews. Many leading 
Rothschilds have been dubbed &quot;King of the Jews&quot;. But what kind of Judaism do the 
Rothschilds support? Do they support the orthodox Jews who believe in the Old 
Testament and are waiting for the return of the messiah? No. Do they support 
Messianic Jews who believe Jesus Christ was the messiah who came to save all 
men? No. The Rothschilds support those Jews who have fallen prey to the 
deceptive gnostic and occultic teachings of Cabalism, and in turn support the 
Illuminati controlled Zionist movement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Not all Zionists are part of the conspiracy, but their leaders are, and the 
ultimate leaders of the Zionists have been the Rothschilds. I am disappointed by 
some researchers, who automatically coin the conspiracy a &quot;Jewish&quot; one. This 
unfortunate stumbling block has polluted their work, making it just as 
misleading as the information put out by the popular media. These researchers 
seem blinded by the fact that the conspiracy has abused and manipulated the 
Jewish race more than any other group in the history of the world. The hierarchy 
of the Jews has sat back and allowed the attack on, and control of the Jewish 
masses for the furtherance of Satan�s agenda. I am saying this to let you see 
that I am not anti-semitic. I believe that there are people who call themselves 
&quot;Christians&quot; who are part of the conspiracy, at the same token there are people 
who call themselves &quot;Jews&quot; who are part of the conspiracy. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">To call the conspiracy &quot;Jewish&quot; is ignorant. I believe the Rothschilds to 
have been involved in Cabalism, Jewish Sabbatism, or Frankism, all of which<span lang="en-gb">
</span>are involved in witchcraft. This belief is strengthened by the 
Rothschild�s use of the occultic Seal of Solomon as a family symbol. The city in 
which the Rothschilds originated, Frankfort, was deeply anti-Semitic. The 
Rothschilds were constantly striving to overcome the boundaries put on them 
because of their culture. It is very likely this berthed a bitterness in their 
hearts towards &quot;Christian&quot; society. This bitterness, and the need to facilitate 
more profit and power were most likely the reasons why they excepted the idea of 
a Jewish state. (I will assume that the readers understand that the Zionism / 
restoration of Israel concept is an unbiblical sham.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The following quote will help you understand the Rothschild attitude towards 
the Jews. <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>the first principle of the House of 
Rothschild was to amass wealth, [and] the liberation of the [Jewish] race from 
oppressive restrictions contributed Indirectly to this end, since it would 
facilitate intercourse with the rest of the world, and thereby increase the 
possibility of financial gain, which in turn would serve to increase its power.&quot; 
(The Rise of The House of Rothschild by Count Egon Corti, p. 124-125)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Amschel of the Frankfort House was constantly harassed by anti-semites. As a 
result &quot;He became the grand almoner and grand protector to the German Jews; he 
helped sweep away the chains of Jew Street; he pressed, in the end successfully, 
for the Jews� enfranchisement as free citizens of Frankfort.&quot; One of the main 
Rothschild agents used to promote the emancipation of the Jews in Frankfort was 
Frederick von Gentz, the evil &quot;Pen of Europe&quot;. At this point I must clarify 
something for the reader. There are 3 Baron Edmond Rothschilds, and all 3 have 
been involved with the nation of Israel. To avoid confusion I will number them:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">#1 Baron Edmond de Rothschild -(1845-1934) House of France. Son of James and 
brother of Alphonse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">#2 Baron Edmund &quot;Eddie&quot; L de Rothschild - (1916- ) House of England. Son of 
Uonei Nathan and great, great grandson of the infamous Nathan Rothschild.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">#3 Baron Edmond de Rothschild -(1926. ) House of France. Son of Maurice and 
grandson of #1 Edmond.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The story begins with #1 Edmond, the &quot;Father of Israel&quot;. During the Crimean 
War (which was funded by the Rothschilds) the small Jewish community in 
Jerusalem became cut off from all outside support. This resulted in 
&quot;semi-starvation&quot;. #1 Edmond�s father, James, set up the James Mayer de 
Rothschild Hospital in Jerusalem in response to this problem. #1 Edmond picked 
up his fathers interest in Palestine. When the Russian Jews fled the Czar�s 
pogroms in the 1880�s Edmond began to finance the Russian Jew�s attempts to 
establish colonies in Palestine, It is clear that #1 Edmond was a fan of 
Zionism, his charities were not only aiding the persecuted but were promoting 
the concept of a return the &quot;homeland&quot;. &quot;The Baron�s money drained swamps, dug 
wells and built houses. It founded industries ranging from scent factories to 
glass works, form wine cellars to bottle manufacturers. The Baron established 
his own administration in Palestine and his overseers dictated to the farmers 
exactly what crops were to be grown and where.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The man who set up the first Zionist Congress was Theodor Herzl. He attempted 
to get the support for his plans to &quot;restore the Jewish state&quot; from the 
Rothschilds but many members of the family were opposed to Zionism (the 
Rothschilds supported those causes which they could profit from and the 
Integration of Jews into the European culture was profitable for them. One 
Rothschild told Herzl he was an Englishman and proposed to remain one. #1 Edmond 
on the other hand. was leading a Rothschild plan similar to Herzl�s that slowly 
created a Jewish state controlled by the family). #1 Edmond did not oppose 
Zionism, in fact he supported Herzl�s cause, yet he felt Herzl�s plans should 
not be implemented so soon (they were &quot;to be accomplished quietly, stealthily, 
not by shouting from the roof-tops&quot;), plus he was concerned that Herzl would 
take away too much Rothschild power over the slowly forming Jewish state. The 
Baron continued to support his own colonies and though Herzl was socially 
supported, because his Ideas facilitated Rothschild power in Palestine, he was 
not allowed to implement his plans. #1 Edmond did not want Herzl in control. 
Later, after Herzl had died and was no longer a threat, #1 Edmond &quot;admitted&quot; 
that Herzl had been right, and went right on pouring money into the Jewish 
&quot;Homeland&quot;. #1 Edmond had a tight-fisted control of the colonies. ,,... the 
Baron was a dictator who expected the colonists to obey him unquestionably.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1901 the Jews in Palestine sent a delegation to the Baron who told him
<span lang="en-gb">&nbsp; &quot;</span>if you wish to save the Yishuv [the -83 Jewish 
settlement] first take your hands from It, and ... for once permit the colonists 
to have the possibility of correcting for themselves whatever needs correcting 
...&quot; This upset the Baron. He replied: &quot;I created the Yishuv, I alone. Therefore 
no men, neither colonists nor organizations, have the right to interfere in my 
plans.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Herzl was succeeded as President of World Zionism by David Wolffsohn. 
Wolffsohn got the full support of the Baron. Wolffsohn�s successor was Otto 
Warburg. Another prominent leader of the Zionists was Chalm Weizmann. Weizmann 
was on better terms with #1 Edmond than his predecessor, Herzl. He made this 
observation of the Baron after their first visit. &quot;In manner be could be both 
gracious and brutal; and this was the reflex of his split personality; for on 
the one hand he was conscious of his power and arrogant in the possession of it; 
on the other hand he was rather frightened by it, and this gave him a touch of 
furtiveness.&quot; The Baron Rothschild told Weizmann be would finance a Hebrew 
University in Palestine. With Weizmann�s appearance on the scene the Baron 
became closer to Zionism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1914 #1 Edmond travelled to Palestine. &quot;Edmond could scarcely believe his 
eyes. Tel Aviv had become a city and his miserable windswept colonies had been 
transformed into lush gardens...&quot; His journey to Palestine was hailed as the 
&quot;prince returning to his people&quot;. Later the Baron Rothschild told Weizmann: 
&quot;Without me Zionism would not have succeeded, but without Zionism my work would 
have been struck to death.&quot; Another Rothschild embraced Zionism through Weizmann 
- Lionel Walter, the second Lord Rothschild (apparently this upset some 
relations). The Balfour declaration, which declared England�s support of the 
creation of a Jewish homeland, was addressed to Lord Rothschild II. Lord 
Rothschild also received the documents of support from the League of Nations. 
Charles T. Russell sent a letter to Lord Rothschild that praised him for his 
work towards a Jewish homeland. After World War I Britain ruled Palestine, and 
the Rothschilds ruled Britain. Also, a bulk of unpaid debts to the Rothschilds 
by the failed Ottoman Empire gave the family more control over Palestine. Then 
came Hitler. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">According<span lang="en-gb"> </span>to Walter Langer, a psychoanalyst who 
wrote the book THE MIND OF ADOLF HITLER, the demonic German leader was a 
grandson of a Rothschild. <span lang="en-gb">&quot;</span>Adolf�s father, A<span lang="en-gb">loi</span>s 
Hitler, was the illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber. It was generally 
supposed that the father of Alo<span lang="en-gb">i</span>s Hitler was Johann 
Georg Hiedler....</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;There are some people who seriously doubt that Johann Georg Hiedler was the 
father of Alois.... [an Austrian document was supposedly] prepared that proved 
Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at the time she conceived. &quot;At 
that time she was employed as a servant in the home of [a] Baron Rothschild. As 
soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back to her home ... 
where Alois was born.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It is believed that Hitler (who was totally created by Satan�s Empire) 
attacked Austria first, in order to destroy the Austrian records that proved his 
Jewish ancestry. As Hitler�s demonic attack on the Jews progressed, one would 
imagine that the Zionists would come to the rescue and offer Palestine as a safe 
haven. Not so. Many European countries shut their doors to the Jews, including 
the Palestine colonies. The Zionist controlled immigration laws in Palestine 
were very strict and it was near impossible to escape to the Jewish homeland. In 
fact, the Zionists refused to admit there was a Holocaust going on although 
evidence points to them knowing! I suppose in their minds it was ok to sacrifice 
a great number of Jewish lives in order to promote the idea of a Jewish state. 
To the elite the Holocaust was like shooting dead a herd of cattle to receive 
the insurance payment. Said Michael Seizer in his book. ZIONISM RECONSIDERED: 
&quot;Not even the events of 1933 aroused their [Zionism�s] political interest. They 
were naive enough to see them as a God-sent opportunity for an undreamt of wave 
of immigration to Palestine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">When the Zionist Organization against the natural impulses of the whole 
Jewish people, decided to do business with Hi<span lang="en-gb">tl</span>er, to 
trade German goods against the wealth of German Jewry, to flood the Palestine 
market with German products and thus make a mockery of the boycott against 
German-made articles, they found little opposition in the Jewish National 
Homeland, and least of all among its aristocracy - the so-called Kibutniks.&quot;
</font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hitler forced the Jews to wear the six-pointed star as a sign of shame. It 
was this same symbol that the Rothschilds were named after and the same symbol 
that the Zionists promoted as a symbol of Jewish national identity. Do you see 
the contradiction? Said Jewish author OJ. Graham in THE SIX-POINTED STAR: &quot;Not 
all the concentration camp victims were Jewish people. Many were Christians. 
Spiritually, a parallel can be seen in the rituals to Ashteroth and Moloch, 
where the victims were burned as sacrifices to these false gods. Were the 
victims of the Nazis someone�s sacrificial offerings?&quot; I believe they were. 
Remember the six-pointed star was the symbol of Moloch and Ashteroth. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, few Jews will tolerate a discussion of this subject. After 
World War II, the U.N., spurred on by the Illuminati created horrors against the 
Jews, <span lang="en-gb">gr</span>anted Israel its statehood. Weizmann was the 
first president of Israel�s Knesset (which was built with Rothschild money). The 
occultic hexagram is on the Knesset, and is also displayed on the Jewish flag. 
&quot;...the six-pointed star [had] made its way from Egyptian pagan rituals of 
worship, to the goddess Ashteroth and Moloch, to King Solomon when he went into 
idolatry,&quot; say, Graham. &quot;Then it progressed through the magic arts, witchcraft 
[including Arab magicians, Druids, witches and Satanists], astrology (in which 
It was no new thing), through the Cabala to Isaac Luria, a Cabalist, in the 16th 
century, to Mayer Amschel Bauer, who changed his name to this symbol, to 
Zionism, to the Knesset of the new State of Israel, to the flag of Israel and 
Its medical organization equivalent to the Red Cross.&quot; What is the ultimate goal 
of Zionism? David Ben-Gurion, a Zionist leader, tells us: &quot;With the exception of 
the U.S.S.R. as a federated Eurasian state, all other continents will become 
united in a world alliance, at whose disposal will be an International police 
force.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">All armies will be abolished, and there will be no more wars. In Jerusalem, 
the United Nations (a truly United Nations) will build a Shrine of the Prophets 
to serve this federated union of all continents; this will be the seat of the 
Supreme Court of Mankind, to settle all controversies among the federated 
continents.&quot; Simply stated, Zionism (with Rothschild support) promotes a New 
World Order. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Rothschild control of Israel is Immense. #1 Edmond established Trusts 
that make massive donations to Israel. Biographer Virginia Cowles explains: 
&quot;Originally the principle Trust was known as Pica - Palestine Jewish 
Colonization Association - but when it became clear, after the establishment of 
the State of Israel, that colonization would be handled by the Government, Its 
functions were changed. Edmond�s son, James, renamed it <span lang="en-gb">'</span>Hanadiv� 
the Hebrew word for �benefactor� by which his father was known throughout 
Palestine; and at the same time rechannelled the Trust�s funds to the promotion 
of education, science and culture. When James died in 1957 his widow, Dollie, 
assumed the presidency which she still holds. For many years she has been 
powerfully assisted by Lord [Victor] Rothschild, and recently she has enlisted 
the help of the latter�s son, [Lord] Jacob. The Trust knows no boundaries. In 
the 1960s it carried out James� wishes by providing money for the Knesset, the 
new Parliament building in Jerusalem. Today its beneficiaries range from 
universities, hospitals and public libraries to archaeological digs; from the 
board of the Weizmann Scientific Institute to the organizers of Instructional 
Television.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">#2 Edmund is the most &quot;race-conscious&quot; of all the Rothschilds. He is on the 
board of many Jewish philanthropies - including president of the Association of 
Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, joint treasurer of the Council of Christians and 
Jews and treasurer of the Friends of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1967 
he sent a letter to THE TIMES magazine suggesting Great Britain, Russia, and the 
U.S. all chip in and build de-salinization plants for Israel so that the desert 
could be turned into a lush garden, with plenty of food and nothing to fight 
over (I have found that #2 Edmund loves to come up with cock-a-maime scientific 
suggestions towards the solution of world problems. For example, in an address 
to the organizers of the U.N.�s Earth Summit, he suggested building massive 
dry-ice machines on the polar capes to prevent their melting in the face of 
global warming). #2 Edmund is also a warden of the Great Synagogue in London. He 
is the senior member of New Court in London and is a member of the Illuminati�s 
Pilgrim Society. #3 Edmond is an entrepreneur. He is very involved in tourism, 
and has funded many luxury resorts in Israel. He controls Compagnie Financlere, 
which is his holding company in France. He owns Banque Privee in Switzerland, 
and a merchant bank in Paris. He controls the largest toy company and the 
largest frozen food company in France. He is a director of Belgium�s Banque 
Lambert, and of DeBeers Consolidated Mines in South Africa. He is on the 
Steering Committee of the Bilderbergers. And his interests extend into Israel, 
where he is the chairman of Tri-Continental Pipelines. Chairman of the Israel 
Corporation, and chairman of Isrop, which controls the Israel General Bank. The 
list continues. #3 Edmond is on the board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
He directs the Middle East Peace Institute, which he founded in 1967.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">He regularly donates money to the Biological-Physio-Chemical Institute, which 
was founded by his grandfather, #1 Edmond. Hesits on the boards ofa dozen or so 
hospitals and scientific institutes. #3 Edmond is considered the richest 
Rothschild. He has massive power, and this includes control of much of Israel. 
The Rothschilds have even had a street named in their honour. The First 
International Bank of Israel is located at 39 Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv. 
Bank Hapoalim, &quot;Israel�s fastest growing bank&quot;, is next door at 50 Rothschild 
Boulevard. The satanic Rothschilds simply dominate Israel. Apparently Israel has 
served as the meeting grounds for the French and English Rothschilds. The French 
and English Houses contributed over $1 million to Israel around the time of the 
Six-Day War. It is reported that when Baron Alain of the French House visited 
Israel he &quot;burst into tears&quot; at the sight of the walling wall. Baroness Alix of 
the French House is the World President of Youth Aliyah, which deals with the 
emigration of Jewish children to Israel. Evelyn of the English House is chairman 
of the Board of Governors of the Technion, Israel�s Institute of Technology. The 
satanic Rothschilds simply dominate Israel. The Rothschilds help Satan�s Empire 
control the world�s resources, the world�s nations and the world�s religions. 
They are an institution in the conspiracy and, if one looks carefully, the path 
of their destructive reign can be followed through the history of the past 3 
centuries.</font></p>
