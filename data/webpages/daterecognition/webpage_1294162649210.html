        <p><strong>FALWELL AND ABORTION....</strong><a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=108636">Via Brad Plumer,</a> Michelle Goldberg writes in the <em>Guardian</em> that <a href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/michelle_goldberg/2007/05/falwells_folly.html">abortion wasn't originally a big issue for the Christian Right:</a><blockquote><p>The religious right's creation myth holds that Roe v Wade so outraged the faithful that they could no longer sit passively on their pews. As the Columbia University historian Randall Balmer has shown, this is nonsense. The Southern Baptist Convention, Falwell's denomination, was officially pro-choice throughout the 1970s; anti-abortion activism was seen as the province of Catholics, a group then widely despised by fundamentalist Protestants. No, what really galvanized the religious right were Supreme Court rulings stripping whites-only Christian academies, like the one Falwell founded in 1966, of their tax-exempt status. Fervent opposition to abortion, which eventually cemented the alliance between conservative Protestant and Catholics, came later.</blockquote><p>There's no question that early evangelical leaders were originally drawn to politics by the loss of tax-exempt status for their segregated schools, which happened via a series of court rulings before <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was even a twinkle in Harry Blackmun's eyes.  Still, while the SBC may have been "officially" pro-choice during the 70s, it was pro-choice only "reluctantly," and Falwell himself was always virulently anti-abortion and anti-gay.  What's more, it was only after abortion and gay bashing were added to the evangelical mix that the Christian Right became a genuine, broad-based "movement."</p>

<p>In 1978, for example, the <em>Washington Post</em> reported that Falwell was "against abortion, poronography and homosexuality, and created a stir in the 1976 presidential campaign in Virginia when he attacked Jimmy Carter for being interviewed by Playboy magazine."  In 1979, after Falwell founded the Moral Majority, the <em>Post</em> reported that his goals "include tax breaks for church-run schools, diplomatic recognition of the new government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, and the frustration of the abortion and gay rights movement."  Later that year <em>U.S. News & World Report</em> reported that "Falwell's aims include sharp restrictions on abortion, an end to pornography, defeat of the proposed SALT treaty and rejection of the equal-rights amendment."</p>

<p>Money and segregation were certainly issues for Falwell and others, but it was abortion and gay bashing that powered them to fame and fortune, and they know it.  There's a good reason that the old guard evangelicals feel <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_03/010888.php">badly threatened by Richard Cizik.</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: Don Byrd, who writes the <a href="http://www.bjconline.org/cgi-bin/">BJC blog,</a> emails to add some historical context:<blockquote><p>The mistake in Michelle's piece is in saying the Southern Baptist Convention is "Falwell's denomination." That's a bit misleading in a paragraph about SBC views in the 70s. Falwell was an "independent Baptist," in large part because of the positions the SBC took with which he disagreed: church-state separation, against prayer in schools, and abortion allowance in cases of rape, incest and health of the mother among them. Once the SBC had transformed itself into a GOP, social conservative machine, partly due to being inspired by Falwell's Moral Majority, then sure, he said he could be one with the SBC. But that was much much later &#151 1996, to be exact. For some 10 years before that the relationship between Falwell and the SBC was limited to that of a "mutual admiration society."  And before <em>that</em> you'd have to say he would not have wanted to be affiliated with them in any way.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Well, as someone who grew up in a liberal fundamentalist household in the 1970's (yes, as Balmer notes, we do exist) is it revisionist history if these struggles actually occurred in our daily lives long before the media picked up on them?</p>

<p>If they had the choice, would they prefer acquiring tax-exempt status over being champions of today's "fame & fortune" issues?</p>

<p>In other words, are they for sale?</p>

<p>I find it very interesting that the early language on abortion had to do with "sharp restrictions" and "frustration" of abortion rights.</p>

<p>It seems that the position evolved only over time to be banning all abortion.</p>

<p>The Christian right was morally humiliated by the civil rights movement.  Preachers like Falwell who’d defended segregation were painfully aware that the wider culture viewed their politics as unchristian & immoral.  In response, they sought to reassert their moral status, retake the high ground, put their tormentors on the defensive, by shifting the center of public moral discourse from issues of race & poverty to those of sexuality.  If not for the tremendous resentment white Southern conservatives felt in the wake of the civil rights movement, the emotional energy behind fundamentalist Protestant anti-abortion activism would have been much weaker.</p>

<p>Well, yes and no. </p>

<p>The first IRS restrictions were laid down under the Nixon administration, but the real firestorm came later. It was becoming evident that a number of segregation academies were still benefitting from tax-exempt status in the late '70s, so Carter's IRS Commissioner Jerome Kurtz tightened the regulations. </p>

<p>That fight was, according to Viguerie and Weyrich, the spark for the religious right. They organized new networks in 1978 to protest the regulations, and then built on those a year later to form the Moral Majority, etc.</p>

<p>But on the larger point, yes, evangelicals and fundamentalists didn't care about abortion until the late '70s.</p>

<p>The Christian right was morally humiliated by the civil rights movement.  Preachers like Falwell who’d defended segregation were painfully aware that the wider culture viewed their politics as unchristian & immoral.  In response, they sought to reassert their moral status, retake the high ground, put their tormentors on the defensive, by shifting the center of public moral discourse from issues of race & poverty to those of sexuality.  If not for the tremendous resentment white Southern conservatives felt in the wake of the civil rights movement, the emotional energy behind fundamentalist Protestant anti-abortion activism would have been much weaker.</p>

<p><i>Money and segregation were certainly issues for Falwell and others</i></p>

<p>Kevin, it is rich with irony liberals are now complaining about Dr. Jerry Falwell being a racist.  What about the liberal support for the racists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton?  What about the bigoted attacks against Mitt Romney's Mormonism by Sharpton and other liberals?  The modern version of segregation and Jim Crow laws is affirmative action.  How come liberals still support it?  Until liberals reject Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and end affirmative action, conservatives will never believe liberals are sincere in their desire to end racism.</p>

<p>Also, for the record, Falwell's school -- Lynchburg Christian Academy -- was opened as a school for whites only, but admitted a small number of black students soon thereafter. </p>

<p>He wasn't an outright segregationist, but his comments on King et al. at the time were highly critical. Go check out his famous "Ministers and Marches" speech where he denounces the Selma campaign. </p>

<p>It was only in recent decades that opposition to abortion became a "non-feminist", "conservative" issue.   Before that the sides were, if anything, reversed.  Early feminists were anti-abortion, and Planned Parenthood didn't come out in favor of legalized abortion until 1969.</p>

<p>Another conservative myth is that the Supreme Court forced something on the states that no one wanted. </p>

<p>They forget about the wave of states that were liberalizing their abortion laws during the late '60s and early '70s. These weren't just blue states like New York and California (where Gov. Ronald Reagan signed the abortion liberalization law), but also places like North Carolina.</p>

<p>My father was a minister and an executive with the American Baptist churches.  One of the state's congregations brought in a graduate of Falwell's seminary as their ministry in the late 70's.  In very short order the new minister tore the church apart by making anti-abortion the litmus test for members.  This old established church's congregation was split in two with Falwell's minister taking the church out of the American Baptist denomination and affliating it with Falwell's group.  The kicker was several months after they withdrew my father received a newsletter from Falwell's church proudly claiming credit for founding this "new" church.  I don't think I ever saw him so mad.</p>

<p>My father could never stand the fundmentalists, and especially Falwell, becuase they distorted and destroyed the true message of Christ.</p>

<p>I am with K and Al helps prove the point I have argued for a number of years that a large portion of the Christian right has used abortion as a code for racism because it is a more acceptable stance in the wider culture.Instead of going after the "libruls" on race, they can go after them for abortions, tolerance of different sexual preferences, "activist courts" etc. The real proof is that they have stood by the Republican party which apart from paying lipservice to anti abortion policies really has not done as much on that score as it has in keeping policies designed to help minorities in check. The real problem for the Republicans is immigration--the Christian right hates the brown people as much as the black people, but too many Republicans like to exploit the cheap labor.</p>

<p>Again, this reinforces the idea that anti-abortion politics for these people was driven in part by a <i>displacement</i> of resentment over their defeat by racial liberals.

<p>Jerry was a con man who tricked poor and diseased people into sending him money because of his supposed direct pipeline to God.</p>

<p>Fuck him.<br />

<p>Roe is going to be overturned; the equal rights amendment never was ratified; Congress sat on a whole slew of treaties; and slowly but surely, public education is being destroyed.</p>

<p>So, why have the wingers won?  I would say it is because the "left" (whatever the fuck that is in this country) has no common goals, no philosophy that unites it.</p>

<p>Take abortion for instance: neither DailyKos or AmericaBlog give a rat's ass about this issue.  Filibuster Roberts or Alito?  Not worth it according to the leading liberal bloggers?  The war? Well, Bush is for it, so we must be against it.  But call for impeachment?  Nah, we'll let our readers do that.</p>

<p>Michelle Goldberg doesn't know what she's talking about. I grew up in a conservative (as opposed to moderate) Southern Baptist church and after the Roe v. Wade supreme court decision, it was a very big deal at our church. We'd make up posters with little baby fetuses in my sixth grade sunday school. And gays? Hello? Has she never heard of Anita Bryant and her anti-gay campaign in Miami in the 70s?</p>

<p>Fortunately, Falwell's hucksterism lifted the scales from my eyes and I left the SB church as soon as I was an adult. But the tax rule was never an issue in my church. The rumblings might have started with the 1960s school prayer ruling by the Supreme Court. But I really do think Roe v. Wade caused the conservative wing of the SB convention to start uniting politically. Before that, the SB convention and its seminaries were dominated by so-called moderates, a la Jimmy Carter. What Michelle doesn't understand about SBs is the the convention hierarchy, at least at that time, did not control individual churches. Each church made its own rules -- that was a premise of Southern Baptism.</p>

<p>That said, I also was very pro-environment growing up, even had one of those earth flags hanging in my bedroom, and no one saw anything sinful about that. And there was a healthy debate in my sunday school about whether to pull the plug when a loved one was in a coma. The uniformity of belief about Terry Schiavo was rather alarming when I recall those days. </p>

<blockquote>Someone should point out to Michelle Goldberg that Catholics belong to a church, it's a denomination, a rather large one. It isn't a group as she states in the exerpt.

</blockquote>

<p>Someone should point out to the poster here named "Jon" that while not all groups are churches or denominations, all churches or denominations are also groups, and therefore, while Michelle Goldberg would have been correct had she called Catholics a denomination or church, she was also correct to call them a group. </p>

<p>(Actually, if she intended to include both the Roman Catholic Church and self-declared 'Traditional Catholic' communities that are, in whole or in part, out of communion with Rome, they still form a definable "group" but are quite arguably not part of a common denomination or church, whether she intended that or not is unclear and not particularly important to the overall idea that she was communicating.)</p>

<blockquote>Early feminists were anti-abortion, and Planned Parenthood didn't come out in favor of legalized abortion until 1969.</blockquote>

<p>Early feminists were, as I recall, not categorically of one mind about abortion; it was a divide within feminism that split roughly on class lines between elite and working class feminism, along with birth control and a lot of other thing, and also corresponded a lot with the split between "virtue" feminism (which favored, e.g., suffrage as a way to create a more virtuous society) and "equal rights" feminism (which favored women's rights broadly).</p>

<p>OTOH, I recall reading, 15 years or so ago, a 1974 Planned Parenthood book on abortion which largely approached it as a <i>problem</i> that policy ought to seek to eliminate (presumably, by working mostly on the demand side) even though it implicitly took the stance that it should be legal. So, yeah, I'd agree that the rhetorical positions have shifted and hardened on <i>both</i> sides over time. <br />

<p>Probably not a toll call from "up there" to "down there" so I suppose that Mr. Uniter is letting Mr. Hate know where abouts Mr. Hate`s moral compass lost its lock on reality. Also reminding him to prepare some room for Dobson, Moon, Robertson et al that will be along soon & that he ain`t gonna be needin no sweaters no more.</p>

<p>Jerry Falwell was concerned that America was becoming too secular.  He thought (wrongly) that the Bible guided the founding fathers of the United States as they wrote the constitution and put our country together.  These are the things he emphasized in the introduction to his first book (Listen, America!) published in 1980.  He wrote that a “whole generation of Americans were reared under the influence of a government that taught them socialism and welfarism”.  He was very Nixonian in his call for “silent” (Moral Majority) Christians to rise up and take back the government from immoral liberals.</p>

<p>Falwell and LaHaye were unique in that they pushed the application of a specific litmus test for political candidates.  The test consisted of the following questions that demonstrate where their heads were at.  This was a test that Falwell said Christians should apply.</p>

<p>a.	Do you agree that this country was founded on a belief in God and the moral principles of the Bible?  Do you concur that this country has been departing from those principles and needs to return to them? <br />
b.	Would you favor stricter laws relating to the sale of pornography?<br />
c.	Do you favor stronger laws against the use and sale of hard drugs?<br />
d.	Are you in favor of legalizing marijuana?<br />
e.	Would you favor legalizing prostitution?<br />
f.	Do you approve of abortions on demand when the life of the mother is not in danger?<br />
g.	Do you favor laws that would increase homosexual rights?<br />
h.	Would you vote to prevent known homosexuals to teach in schools?<br />
i.	Do you favor capital punishment for capital offenses?<br />
j.	Do you favor the right of parents to send their children to private schools?<br />
k.	Do you favor voluntary prayer in the public schools?<br />
l.	Do you favor removal of the tax-exempt status of churches?<br />
m.	Do you believe that government should remove children from their parents’ home except in cases of physical abuse?<br />
n.	Do you favor sex education, contraceptives, or abortions for minors without parental consent?<br />
o.	Except in wartime or dire emergency, would you vote for government spending that exceeds revenue?<br />
p.	Do you favor a reduction in taxes to allow families more spendable income?<br />
q.	Do you favor a reduction in government?<br />
r.	Do you favor passage of the Equal Rights Amendment?<br />
s.	Do you favor busing schoolchildren out of their neighborhood to achieve racial integration?<br />
t.	Do you favor more federal involvement in education?<br />

<p>One of the oddities of the Roe debate is how pro-choice people for the most part successfuuly  avoid talking about the breadth of the Roe holding and how pro-life people are generally ineffective in educating the public about the true breadth of Roe.  Part of it is a largely pro choice media, but it still is an interesting aspect of the debate.</p>

<p>For example, what percentage of Americans do you think know that Roe stands for the proposition that for up to about six months, a mother has a constitutional right to abort the baby because she does not like the gender of the child.  Or because she has found a new boyfriend.  Or because she has a long planned vacation that she does not want to reschedule. Or because it inconveniences her education or career plans.  Etc.</p>

<p>The pro choice side has been very effective at keeping these facts out of the public debate, while the pro life side has been very ineffective in presenting the facts.  I don't know why.  The pro life advocates could make these points every time and effectively raise the level of understanding among the public.  It would at least shift the polls a few points toward the pro life side if more people correctly understood Roe, don't you think?</p>

<p>I remember reading that several years ago Jerry Falwell admitted that the Moral Majority was never a majority (as he was dissolving it)...thus meaning that his Moral Majority organization was founded on a LIE...and since all liars go to hell, based on Jerry Falwell's own beliefs...then we all know where Jerry Falwell and all members of his non-majority, lying, deceitful Moral Majority are really going...and it ain't heaven.</p>

<p>So sad. Too bad. But Jerry Falwell should not have lied in pursuit of his hardcore, ultra-orthodox, right-wing anti-Christ, anti-democracy religious agenda.</p>

<p>But there is hope. I believe in reincarnation and that one reaps the judgments one has sown in their previous life.</p>

<p>Thus, I foresee Jerry Falwell, in his next incarnation, being "born again" as a black female child, who will grow up gay, in some backward country, ruled by religious bigots like he was previously, who hate gays and hate women. It'll be a twofer. And seem like hell. Which may be where the idea of hell originated. But we always keep forgetting.</p>

<p>As one sows, one must reap. Too bad Jerry Falwell chose intolerance over acceptance and hate over love. But then, there's always next time. Or the next. Or the next. A merciful, forgiving God wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't prove any of this. But it definitely makes me pause, and stop judging (as much as possible), especially after that little black kid said to me in astonishment, "Oh, oh, I remember you. You were at my funeral," and after I later realized that this little, four-year-old black kid was the incarnation of my deceased uncle who had died five years earlier. He even looked like a short, dark-skinned version of my deceased uncle, even down to the same eyeglasses.</p>

<p>I don't know. But it has made me less judgmental (like Jesus taught), and more accepting, tolerant and forgiving...because I just may be accepting of, tolerant of and forgiving of myself.</p>

<p>Peace be with you all.</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to mention.</p>

<p>My deceased uncle was a white racist who hated all black people.</p>

<p>Thus, what could be more appropriate (as well as a learning experience) than for him to come back as a member of the race he previously had nothing but contempt for? Walking in someone else's shoes, thus, takes on a whole new meaning. What if it is literal, at least, from a soul perspective?</p>

<p>Who knows? But I figure we'll all find out, one way or another. In the meantime, though, I think I'll "err" on the side of tolerance, acceptance, forgiveness and unconditional love. Better to be safe than sorry...just in case.</p>
