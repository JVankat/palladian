 loop="-1" scrollamount="2" width="100%"><b>Dream lofty dreams and as you dream so you shall become. Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; Your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil. James Lane Allen.</b></MARQUEE>
<b>Our character flaws make us unique and interesting. Trying to change these flaws can be futile, as it is a crucial component of a persons make up. However being totally unconscious of its nature and affect on others and the environment is even more foolhardy as, left unattended, it may fall into shadow and become troublesome, rather than just quirky.<br>

</p><p>Character flaws are a part of someone�s fate and they need to be acknowledged, accepted and integrated into the overall personality. Disenfranchised, these character flaws can morph into eccentric and autonomous aspects of the Self that can dominate the personality and frighten others.</B><br>

</p><p>Here we will call them Quirks.<br>

</p><p><FONT COLOR="#ffOOOO"><B>ARIES QUIRKS-</font></b> Being the first sun sign, Aries is the baby of the Zodiac and what do babies do? They scream when they don�t get their own way. They rush in where angels fear to tread and they push the BOUNDARIES. They have been doing this since they were children, why stop now? They love challenges and they go fast at everything unless it is responsibility. They get bored easily so a relationship with them can have commitment issues. When they don�t get their own way they can get enraged, but then just as quickly they forget about it. Instant gratification is their theme their quirk. They are vulnerable, as little children are, and na�ve, so much so that they cannot see the dangers around the corner or sense that something is wrong. The more vulnerable they feel the more demanding they become. Some Arians adventure in their mind and never get around to the big adventure. However they will, one day! Be careful here, as the frustration may leak out into misguided campaigns based on petty principles. Better to keep moving and, if you don�t succeed, move on.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><B>TAURUS QUIRKS-</font></b>Power, sensuality and wealth motivates the bull. They will not budge unless it�s worth it. Payoffs, chocolate cake, bonus schemes and tax incentives can get them going. If there�s no reward what�s the point in moving, this is a major quirk. They may as well relax� and relax they do. There logic can be, why change when you can stay the same. Try to get them to change and they dig their heels in. They can be so stubborn they won�t get off the train track even though they see the train coming. If you keep pushing for change they will charge. They don�t get angry they get inflamed. Taureans have one speed and that is slower so it�s best to let sleeping bulls lie. Show them how they can make more money doing it your way and you will have their attention. The bull is so security-minded that they get attached to anything that provides them with the feeling of safety and security. Taurus holds onto anything that is a security symbol. Never rush a Taurus they have their own timing. Reports from partners of Taureans complain about their lack of initiative, their addiction to the T.V. or their unwillingness to do anything. Once you�re in a relationship with a Taurus, you may find they don�t want to budge. The main prejudice against Taurus is their possessiveness and materialism. Inherently their preoccupation with the material world is all about their own issues of worth and value which they are working out.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><B>GEMINI QUIRKS-</font></b>Wordsmiths and masters of conversation, Geminis have so much to say it breaks records. For Gemini it is hard to turn off the talk tap. Also, whatever they are in the morning may not be the same that evening. Most likely they will have changed their minds many times since then. They are tricksters but sometimes get caught in their own mischief. Mimicking, caricature and telling jokes can sometimes be hurtful to others. Totally oblivious to the whole situation, they can�t understand how someone�s feelings got hurt through an innocent prank. When Gemini is at the helm, the light can be engulfed quickly by the dark, and laughter may turn to sudden tears. For Gemini the sibling is often a figure in their lives with whom they become entwined (sometimes en-twinned). Highly strung they are usually more excitable than a gaggle of drag queens. Curious, gossip-loving and innovative, they tell a great story. Their tragic quirk is the peter pan syndrome. Charming, attractive, witty, erudite but unavailable and unstable. Neurotic not erotic. When it comes to commitment, they flee. One whiff of responsibility or settling down and Gemini is off, speeding away as fast as possible. Growing up is never part of the Gemini equation.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>CANCER QUIRKS-</font></b>Emotionally letting go is not Cancer�s forte but their quirk. Instead they are inclined to hang on to the bitter end, more of a habitual response than something that is conscious. So when you are trying to break up with a cancer lover, the result is even clingier, with a firm clutch on both your ankles as you try and walk out the door. Cancers have a hard time of letting go of anything that reminds them of the past. What a memory Cancer has if it is about the emotional landmarks of the family or anniversaries and birthdays. Remembering to dust the mantelpiece or fold the washing is another matter. Letting go is the issue they have. Cancer folk love fussing over the family but often forget they are in a relationship. Truth is, on the priority list, the partner does come after the kids, the grand kids, even the pets. Attachment is a necessary process for Cancer. Yet new generations of Cancerians are shifting their attachments from family to career. Cancer is so sensitive. If you don�t call them everyday then something�s wrong. If you say nothing is wrong � you�ve been busy, they still don�t believe you. Cancers always make excuses for others shortcomings; they can forgive the worst behaviour so easily.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>LEO QUIRKS-</font></B>A common quirk complaint about living with a Leo is that you inevitably become the producer of their show, not the co-star. Even thought he firmament is filled with bright stars, there is room for only one on stage, and that�s Leo. Be warned that once you have Leo�s attention, it may be insatiable and need backing up by further adoration. Once the spotlight is turned on them, they bask in its light. For someone so regal and proud, they can be quite silly when the attention they seek is focused on them. Child. Hero. Narcissist and Idealist. Where they stand right now is the stage. Therefore it is often difficult to know whether they are acting or not. Everything is always wonderful and grand with a Leo, even if it isn�t. There�s the dark side of Leo, when the sun goes down, which is far from wonderful. Be sure you are not on their hit list or in their bad books, when the other side emerges. Leo is fixed and they never forget a slight, a snub or being overlooked. If they�ve been left feeling unimportant or sidelined, then their dignity has been severely bruised and that scar is not going to go away too easily. For all their grandiosity, childlike tantrums and mirror gazing, there is a simple rule to follow with Leo. Compliment, support and adore them always and they will be your most loyal friend and helpmate. However if you can�t be their attendant, producer, and cheerleader or simply not support their narcissism, then it will be a bumpy ride.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>VIRGO QUIRKS-</font></b>Virgo needs to be ordered or they can�t cope. Most of them need order and coherence and this is a quirk. Ironically this need doesn�t seem to permeate every corner. The laundry may be disinfected daily but take a peek inside the broom closest which is probably a mess. No-one better to systemise the data or organise the office, but they may forget to organise themselves. Germs are the enemy. So, in the Virgo game plan, they often mistake sanitation for holism. Regimens of vitamins, colonic cleansing often inflames the dis-ease they are intent on healing. This perfectionist streak is an attempt to order the chaos of life but best done through the simple rituals of life, without the idealistic overlay. Obsessive-compulsive? Workaholic? Why so much focus on getting it perfect? Because something dreadful will happen if the course of life is not tidied up. Sure it will � the laundry won�t get done and the bills won�t be paid. Virgo finds it difficult to let go of something till it�s perfect, therefore there�s not a lot of time to relax. There the last ones to turn off the lights in their workplace and the first ones to get their tax returns in. Masterful at worry, Virgo is anxious about what could happen. They obsess over their debts rather than tallying up their assets and are always putting the finishing touches on their creativity! Work in progress, rather than the finished product, is Virgo.<br>

</p><p><font color="ffoooo"><b>LIBRA QUIRKS-</font></b>Librans are dedicated to the beauty game. Retail therapy is another of Libra�s great self-improvement pursuits! Nothing strenuous or too taxing, though, for Libra. Underneath the anti-wrinkle cream lurks the haunting feeling that they�re not really attractive enough, slim enough, or good enough! Therefore they strive to make up for it in charm, pleasing others and partnering, often becoming a serial spouse. Librans can be fairly rude when they don�t get their own way. They have a penchant for instinctively reacting or feeling obliged to take an opposite point of view, even if they don�t agree or support it, a common quirk. If everything is calm they are disruptive; if the atmosphere is stormy they are calm. If someone is behaving horribly, they appear the doyen of virtue and paragon of manners: yet if all is civil they become beasts! Contrary is Libra. The worst is that they befriend their enemies and often estrange their love ones. Libra finds it hard to confront any distasteful situation. While they tend to think they are being altruistic, they are really acting in a passive/aggressive way. Their way of dealing with anger is to forget your name, show up late, if at all, bag you to your friends or avoid you. Trying to balance themselves and avoid confrontation they dip into murky repression! A lot of Libra�s antics stem from their compulsive need to be liked and have a high approval rating. Libra is non-plussed when someone is not engaged with their charm or impressed by their presence. In most cases it derails them, exposing their nasty side, the side they spend so much time avoiding.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>SCORPIO QUIRKS-</FONT></B>Scorpios famous sting or stare is a bit like a champion tennis player�s lightning-fast serves: fast and direct and hard to return, it always gets the point! Always remember one crucial Scorpionic principle: �if you fool around, your gonna get caught�. So be careful if you�re in a relationship with a Scorpion. They�re serious when they say they want all of you! �Till death do us part� stuff. Scorpio experiences life from its most primal layer to its transcendent level. They love so intensely: that�s why they hate so intensely. All this intensity can be exhausting and quirky. Revenge is as natural to Scorpio as sarcasm is to Libra. Scorpio never gets mad, it just gets even. The payback depends on the depth of betrayal. While all Scorpios have a fervent fantasy life, not all are inclined to act out their rage. Scorpios are private and contained and know the power of the evil eye, blinding spells and curses. Therefore they are just as inclined to privately cast a few spells to exact revenge. However, sometimes the fury explodes. When Scorpios triumph financially it often accompanies grief and loss, for this sign contains the mysterious amalgam of riches and death.<br>

</p><p>
</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>SAGITTARIUS QUIRKS-</font></b>A common quirk of Sagittarians is to be fairly blunt and outspoken. They don�t hold back their opinions, even when you haven�t asked for it. Most times their not that interested in yours. In fact, a Sagittarian truism is �when I want your opinion I�ll give it to you. Understatements are never part of a Sagittarian�s vocabulary; they prefer generalisations and sweeping statements. As for refinement, what�s that! The downside is that they know everything and have answers to every question, even those unasked. If they are humble enough not to know the answer, then be sure they will have a comment or response of some sort. Holding back does not occur to this archetype. On and on in a monotone voice, they issue platitudes to anyone who will listen, until the room has cleared. Sagittarians love to preach and pontificate, but don�t point it out, or you will get a blast. Reality is not their strong suit. Possibility is. Never point out to a Sagittarian the pitfalls or the reasons why not, as they will have a million reasons why so. Sag flees from negativity, as if it were a curse that needs to be exorcised. Sagittarius does it their way, if only we could understand what way that is!<br>

</p><p>
</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>CAPRICORN QUIRKS-</font></b>Capricorns are often high up, removed from the every day walks of life, and so focussed on the path in front of them, they may not have noticed what passed them by. Ironically, much of the stamina that propels them up the mountain is fuelled by the need to be loved and lauded but they�ve gotten so far out of range, no one notices them. Alone on the peak is a common Capricorn complaint and quirk. Climbing down the mountain may be trickier than its ascension. Down is not part of Capricorn�s vocabulary, unless it refers to melancholia, which is as much a part of them as fidgeting is to a Gemini or exaggeration is to a Sagittarian. Terribly serious and austere, Capricorn takes the sensible route to the top of the mountain avoiding any short cuts; sight-seeing or time off. Capricorns are often old when young, but grow younger in their outlook as they age. Unfortunately, the doctrine of many a Capricorn is to do it the hard way. That hardship may be imposed on their loved ones �for their own good�. Deprivation is often a conscious attempt to stave off the fear of indulgence, or the belief that there will never be enough. Many a Capricorn has a deprivation complex, or lacks the imagination to do things differently. Unable to see what might be, Capricorn casts a shadow over their potential, critiquing their own capabilities and criticising their achievements. Control is ultimately important. Routine and discipline are also highly prized. Partners and children of Capricorns often complain of being reigned in or overly controlled. Capricorns need to feel in control of their environment and, if you are a part of their environment, then that need also applies to you: too many rules and too many chores for your liking. In the Capricorn psyche, security and control are woven together and for them to feel safe, they need to be in the driver�s seat. Therefore they are often inclined to confuse love and duty, or care and responsibility, feeling rejected when they have provided everything but their partners are still not happy in the relationship! How could a Capricorn let someone else do anything for them, if they are not going to be able to do it right? High standards and expectations leave them feeling isolated. Perfectionistic Capricorn feels a deep need to get it right. There is a standard that they measure their performance by, and that is in the top percentile. Not happy with a good performance, they seek the perfect one, dedicating hours and years and decades to excelling. For Capricorn, accomplishment is identity. If that�s achieved at the expense of familial support, intimacy and friendship, then it�s freezing at the peak and a long way back down to where it�s warm.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>AQUARIUS QUIRKS-</font></b>If Aquarius has a choice of two roads they will always choose the one less travelled. Aquarians cannot bear being in a herd and will balk at conformity. Their great need to rebel against the status quo can make them just plain contrary. The fear of being like everyone else is so great; they will rebel or contradict in order to seem different. On their quest to be individuals, they often confuse their need for space and independence with disengagement and separation, leaving them marginalised and on the fringe. To Aquarius love is vast and abstract. If your in a relationship with an Aquarian and your confused it may be because you get the sense that love is an ideal rather than an emotion and, if any feeling does come up, then it is quickly converted into a concept. Conceptually, feelings are growth-oriented relics of the psyche. Emotions are not something Aquarius feels or understand, so when you finally decide to break up your relationship he/she may say �if that�s what you want, but we can still be friends�. So when you really need a friend, they can easily reply �I hear what you�re saying but there is nothing I can do for you at this moment�. Aquarians are commitment phobic and, at the hint of any attachment, flee, faint or push away. Their relationship vows begin with �I do my thing and you do your thing�. They show up when least expected and are never around when you do want them. If you seek the bizarre, then seek the citizens of this sign and their quirks, as they know what and where that is.<br>

</p><p><font color="#ffoooo"><b>PISCES QUIRKS-</font></b>Pisces the dustbin of the zodiac, Pisces feel burdened and blamed, victimised and persecuted or just plain invisible, or like the target for indiscriminate projections. Poor Pisces and this quirk. Being the last sign in the zodiac they are in the awkward position of seeing and feeling everything but not being seen themselves. Lost in the crowd, they forge their identity from those around them and are acutely aware of what others are feeling and sensing, yet don�t know how to separate these impressions from their own feelings. The trouble is that Pisces has a hard time knowing where they end and someone else begins. Their BOUNDARIES are fluid and since they identify with what is around them, they flow into their surrounds without question. It is wise for Pisces to become more discriminate about where and with whom they choose to be. Born helpers, they cannot help helping. Therefore it is important that there are adequate BOUNDARIES between them and others or they will feel the aches and pains along with those they try to heal. Until they are able to channel their super sensitivity, they are often vulnerable to everything in the atmosphere from colds to bad moods. Susceptible to wanting to please and merge with others, they often find themselves in a co-dependent relationship or co-addictive relationship with someone who compulsively promises to stop (drinking, cheating, abusing�) while they compulsively forgive. When Pisces realises they have been volunteers, not victims, they shape-shift from being meek to ferocious. To Pisces dreams and money may not be made of the same substance but, unfortunately, the banks employees are not instructed to take dreams as deposits. Reality is such a harsh experience for Pisces; therefore idealism masks their sense of loss and their dreaminess numbs their sense of futility.<br>
