        face="Verdana">Butterflies are virtually everywhere. Even in the most 
        urban of environs, these gossamer-winged creatures somehow adapt. To be 
        sure, while more variety and volume flourish in natural areas, even a 
        city garden can provide opportunity for anyone to witness the show these 
        animals put on, free of charge, for anyone who cares to watch. Watching 
        butterflies has become an activity that many have begun to enjoy as a 
        hobby, or as a side-interest for birders and botanists.</font></tt></p>

        most butterfly watchers carry binoculars to help identify the species 
        they see, why not start bringing along a camera? Photographing butterflies 
        can be rewarding and be as simple or as involved as you like. Instead 
        of buying expensive camera equipment right away, consider beginning at 
        a basic level and decide for yourself how far you might wish to pursue 
        the hobby. If you have a video camera, why not start there? If you prefer 
        stills, why not test out the camera you already have. </span></font></p>

					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The 
        first rule of photography is: find a great camera store. Take your photographs 
        to a reputable store that carries a wide range of equipment. Ask if there 
        is someone there who can explain how you might improve your close-up photos 
        next time. You can learn all you need to get started this way. Most knowledgeable 
        camera store staff, if not swamped by other customers, are eager to share 
        their expertise with you. If you don&#8217;t find anyone at this store 
        helpful, (or if all they seem interested in doing is selling you the most 
        expensive cameras they carry), find another store. Eventually you will 
        find one worth their weight in Kodachrome! <br>
									<br>
									Some salespeople might be tempted to oversell you on what you need. Take 
        what they say with a grain of salt, and resist the temptation to walk 
        out of their store with thousands of dollars worth of equipment on the 
        first visit. If they recommend you purchase a new camera for the job, 
        and you aren&#8217;t willing or able to spend outrageous sums of money, 
        ask them about used equipment.<br>
								</span></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><br>
									Another approach is to strike a &#8220;full refund if not completely satisfied&#8221; 
        deal. Some stores will allow you to try a camera out for a short period 
        of time if you pay for it up front, and return it in perfect, &#8220;new&#8221; 
        condition. Unfortunately, this approach is less successful with digital 
        cameras. Some stores won&#8217;t even break the seal on a digital camera 
        package unless you&#8217;re &#8220;serious&#8221;. I wouldn&#8217;t give 
        that kind of store the time of day.<br>
									<br>
									For butterfly photography, using film, you will probably end up looking 
        at a 35mm SLR (single lens reflex--meaning you look through the same lens 
        the photo is taken through) camera with interchangeable lenses. If you 
        go the used route, try to stay with major names like Pentax, Nikon, Canon, 
        or Minolta; brands that the store is licensed to carry. Be sure that the 
        lenses and accessories the maker now sells will fit and function optimally 
        on this used camera. Due to the popularity of digital cameras, used film 
        SLR prices have dropped dramatically in recent years.</span></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p></o:p>

					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>A 
        good starting point is a camera with a lens that can focus within a foot 
        or so of your subject. Ask the salesperson to show you all the alternatives 
        before deciding. Usually, they will start with a fairly hefty-priced solution, 
        and go up and down from there depending on your response. If you frown 
        a lot and reinforce your budget, they might fix you up with a new or used 
        camera with a &#8220;normal&#8221; lens or moderate macro-zoom, and a 
        few close up filters. This would be the most cost-effective first step. 
        If you buy equipment, go back and try some test shots with the paper butterfly 
        again and show these to your salesperson.</o:p> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

        is taking over photography and whether you&#8217;re just getting started 
        or you&#8217;re a seasoned pro, the latest generation of digital cameras 
        is probably the way to go.<br>
								<br>
								There is a plethora of excellent cameras now on the market and to publish 
        one &#8220;best&#8221; camera for butterfly photography would be foolish. 
        Best talk to that great camera store employee near you for the latest 
        and greatest (or he/she may be able to discount last year&#8217;s model 
        that&#8217;s essentially similar to the new one.) There are some excellent 
        websites that test and review these cameras in depth, so I won&#8217;t 
        attempt to here. Suffice it to say, there are excellent choices offered 
        by Nikon, Canon, Fuji, Olympus, Minolta, Pentax, Sony, Kodak and others. 
        Ask that trusty camera store employee what they think would work best 
        for the type of photography you want to do. Chances are, the latest and 
        greatest model just arrived yesterday!<br>
								<br>
								Digital point-and-shoot cameras are actually a good way to start. I&#8217;ve 
        seen amazing results from the current medium to high-resolution cameras! 
        They often focus at very close distances, but give you limited working 
        distance and depth of field control. Some are notoriously sensitive to 
        conditions you may encounter in the field. There are some great digital 
        SLRs now too, that may work with the specialized interchangeable lenses 
        you may already own. Be sure to check your old lenses on any new digital 
        camera before committing yourself. Some of the digital SLRs are pretty 
        picky.<br>
								<br>
								My recommendations change from moment to moment, as the manufacturers 
        scramble to outdo one another. If I mentioned one brand, someone will 
        surely send me a photo taken with another equally good or better.</span></font></p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt" lang="EN-US">For
          the purpose of this essay, we will assume you probably have an auto
          exposure TTL (through the lens metering) camera. Whatever the
          hardware, once you have equipment that can get you close enough to
          your subject, and have decided on what film you want to use (a 400 ISO
          Kodak or Fuji print film would be good to start with), you will need
          to learn how to get you and your camera close enough to your quarry
          without scaring it off. If you are photographing flowers that canï¿½t
          run away, stealth is not important. With butterflies and other
          insects, however, it is crucial.<o:p>
          </o:p></span></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">While 
        many butterflies are more approachable than you might think, sudden movement 
        will startle most butterflies from a dozen feet away or more. Best choose 
        the angle you want to shoot from first, considering the lighting and where 
        your shadow will fall. Ideally for the best, even illumination of the 
        butterflyï¿½s wings, you will want the sun directly above the subject, or 
        over your shoulder. Shooting into the sun at this point would not be best 
        for the novice, since it would probably result in a poorly exposed picture 
        considering the cameraï¿½s automatic metering. In any case, see what angle 
        of light looks best on the butterfly, and approach from that angle with 
        smooth, careful, gradual movements. Be careful not to cast your shadow 
        on the creature, as most butterflies will take wing by instinctive reflex. 
        If other plants are in your path, try to place your feet so as not to 
        trample them. Not only might you damage your neighbourï¿½s flowers, the 
        bending plant might disturb the butterfly. Even stepping on a stick or 
        vine can initiate a domino effect and nudge the butterflyï¿½s perch ever 
        so slightly, spoiling your opportunity.<o:p> </o:p></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The 
        best approach is to take several pictures while you have the subject in 
        focus. Butterflies move so frequently and quickly that in many cases, 
        you have no idea what the best shot will be until the film is processed. 
        Also, you never know how long the butterfly will stick around. If you 
        wait until the perfect instant before tripping the shutter, you can miss 
        the whole opportunity when the butterfly unexpectedly flies off. When 
        photographing butterflies, shoot first and ask questions later. Best to 
        shoot a first frame from a little more distance than you would prefer, 
        and then move closer, shooting more frames as you continue to approach 
        the ideal position.<o:p></span></span></font></p>
					<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt" lang="EN-US">Some
          butterflies will take off and leave the area completely when
          disturbed, while others will just move to another flower and allow you
          to advance until you invade their comfort zone again. Some seem to get
          used to you and tolerate you a little more on subsequent attempts.
          Keep trying; they often reward your perseverance.<o:p>
          </o:p></span></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Donï¿½t

        photography is often referred to as ï¿½macro-photographyï¿½. This refers to 
        taking pictures approaching ï¿½life sizeï¿½. Life size is sometimes expressed 
        as ï¿½1xï¿½ or ï¿½1:1ï¿½, meaning that the subject in real life is represented 
        on the film by an image the same size. Therefore, at life size, a butterfly 
        an inch across in real life will translate on the film (the slide or negative--not 
        the print or digital image) to an image an inch across. You will probably 
        want to aim for ideal magnifications around 1/8 to 1/4 life size to begin 
        with. Unlike most manufacturers, Nikon uses the term <em>micro</em> instead 
        of <em>macro</em> for their 55mm, 105mm and 200mm close-focusing lenses. 
        My understanding is that <em>micro</em> would refer to more extreme magnifications 
        than can be achieved with these lenses, and that they probably use the 
        word for marketing purposes, because it sounds precise, and is more familiar 
        to most people than the word <em>macro</em>.<o:p> Macro lenses are optimized 
        for close-up use, but the vast majority can also focus to infinity with 
        excellent results..</span></span></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Close-Up 
        filters</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> are lenses 
        that screw on to the front of an existing lens to magnify the image the 
        camera sees. They come in various price and quality ranges but are usually 
        the least expensive route. Close-up filters have more or less universal 
        adaptability and can allow inexpensive cameras to focus closer than they 
        were designed to. For a relatively small cost, you can adapt an existing 
        lens to focus considerably closer than normal. Consider that they are 
        somewhat cumbersome to use since you have to put them on to take close 
        ups and take them off again to focus further away. Because they extend 
        the cameraï¿½s lens to an extreme not intended by the manufacturer, they 
        usually are not sharp from corner to corner, and may introduce various 
        distortions and aberrations, which you may or may not notice.<o:p> Cheaper 
        close-up filters may not be optically coated, making them more likely 
        to produce lens flare if the sun strikes them during an exposure.</o:p><o:p>

        of various lengths that mount between the camera and the lens. They also 
        let you focus the lens closer--potentially much closer. While there are 
        no optics involved to reduce sharpness, few lenses are designed with them 
        in mind. They too must be removed for more distant focusing, which can 
        be cumbersome. One thing that tubes do that filters do not is they diminish 
        the light that reaches the film. A through-the-lens (TTL) light meter 
        will adjust for this, but at higher extensions, the reduction in depth 
        of field and shutter speed can be drastic and make available light photographs 
        impractical. Check with your retailer to see what tubes are available 
        that work with your camera and lens. Unlike the filters, extension tubes 
        have to be made specifically for your brand (and sometimes model) of camera.<o:p>

          find a good book or get some advice from your camera salesperson to

          or bellows at higher magnifications to improve resolution.</span></font></p>

        are also devices placed between the camera and lens, and share many disadvantages 
        with extension tubes. They consist of a tube with a lens inside, and work 
        by multiplying the effective focal length of your lens. A 2X tele-converter 
        will double the effective focal length of the lens it is used with. This 
        means a 50mm lens will work more like a 100mm lens and a 100mm will work 
        more like a 200mm and so on. These also come in a wide range of prices 
        and qualities depending on your needs and budget. They let you focus at 
        the same distance your lens would normally focus at, but will double the 
        size you would normally expect in the viewfinder. This works well for 
        photographing butterflies, but, for sooth, there are always considerations. 
        These devices will diminish the quality of the lens to which it is attached 
        to varying degrees. They too diminish the light reaching the film, and 
        can result in reductions in shutter speed or aperture (depth of field), 
        and will rarely result in as sharp a photograph as you would like. Tele-converters 
        are usually available in 1.4X, 2X, and 3X increments. The 1.4X is usually 
        the most advisable, and while the 3X sounds good, it is for most intents 
        and purposes, practically useless. Again, each tele-converter needs to 
        be specifically made for your equipment to fit and function properly.&nbsp;<o:p>

        of the zoom range. If the lens is a 35mm to 70mm zoom, then this means 
        you will be able to focus very close, but you also will have to get very 
        close to your elusive subject. Look for a lens that allows you to access 
        the macro focus throughout its zooming range. Your camera shop person, 
        given your preferences and budget, can probably locate a lens that at 
        least is able to come close to the result you might achieve with a true 
        macro lens.<o:p> In any case, you will be able to do justice with the 
        larger butterflies with a close-focusing zoom lens.</o:p> </span></span></font></p>
					<p style="tab-stops:117.0pt 279.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Macro 
        Lenses</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> are the most 
        effective and convenient piece of equipment for excellent close-up photography. 
        Not surprisingly, they come at a price. Sometimes you can find a used 
        90mm or 100mm lens for a reasonable cost, but normally expect to pay considerable 
        coin for a good new one. I wouldnï¿½t recommend starting with one unless 
        you intend to devote yourself to this pursuit. On the other hand, if a 
        good used macro becomes available, you could always buy it and resell 
        it without sacrificing too much should you lose interest or become discouraged. 
        These lenses are specifically calibrated to work well close up, and come 
        in various focal lengths for 35mm cameras. They usually allow you to focus 
        from up close to infinity and make good all 'round lenses. A 50, 55, or 
        60mm macro lens is best for photographing nature that wonï¿½t run (or fly) 
        away on you. The 90, 100, or 105mm lenses are the most practical in my 
        experience for butterflies, affording a more comfortable working distance 
        as well as working well with extension tubes, should you care to get even 
        closer. Some manufacturers offer 180mm or 200mm macro lenses that are 
        very nice, but very expensive as well. They donï¿½t work as well with some 
        close up accessories such as macro flash rigs, and should be used with 
        a tripod, but they're great for subjects like dragonflies, which can be 
        very skittish and often perch in out-of-reach places..</span></span></font></p>
					<p style="tab-stops:117.0pt 279.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Tripods</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> 
        are great tools to help keep your subjects sharp--as long as the butterflies 
        stay still and the plants they perch on donï¿½t move either. You can probably 
        tell where Iï¿½m going with this. Even the tiniest breath of a breeze can 
        cancel out the benefits of a tripod in close up work. Rarely in nature 
        does a butterfly bask in the sun on a perch anywhere near as stable as 
        a tripod. When it does, get out the tripod--but in the vast majority of 
        the shots I take, a tripod would be impractical. Consider a monopod (a 
        one legged tripod) for practical field use to help steady the camera, 
        and keep your shutter speeds at 1/125 or higher when possible.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

          used by most serious insect photographers to achieve
          the highest image quality on the finest grain (slowest) films. Flash
          units can freeze motion and optimize depth of field, resulting in
          stunning sharpness and detail. There are a number of specialized flash
          units designed for macro use. In conjunction with high-end auto focus,
          auto exposure, and auto fill flash cameras and macro lenses,
          electronic flash can help relative newcomers take professional looking
          butterfly photographs. Perhaps we can deal with this topic on a more

					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Most
          of the above accessories can be used in conjunction with each other,
          but some combinations work better than others. I use extension tubes
          when I need to make my macro lens reproduce beyond life size, and a
          macro flash rig to get dependable, consistent results. Sometimes,
          however, I want to convey a feeling and aim for atmosphere rather than
          technical excellence. With both natural and artificial light
          capabilities, you can tackle just about any situation. I always carry
          a second camera body with a moderate zoom lens, loaded with 400 speed
          film for available light shooting. With a little experience, you will
          get to know which approach will best accomplish what you have in mind.</span></span></font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Ask that friendly camera store person to show
          how you can settle on a combination of cameras, lenses, and
          accessories that will allow you to get the kind of pictures you want
          to take. Your store might also be able to direct you to resources that
          can answer questions they canï¿½t (or lack the time to address). Check
          your library; some books on butterflies include chapters about
          photography, and you may even find a publication devoted to close up
          photography. Any nature photography book by John Shaw is worth
          borrowing or buying.</span></font></p>
