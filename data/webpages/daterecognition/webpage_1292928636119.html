				<h1><a href="#">Pelosi: Bush comments 'beneath the dignity of the office'</a></h1>
				<p>Democratic House leaders are calling out President Bush for a speech in Israel in which he seemed to suggest that Sen. Barack Obama wants the United States to &quot;negotiate with terrorists.&quot;</p>
<p>In his speech,&nbsp;Bush said: &ldquo;Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals, as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House insists that Bush was &quot;referring to a wide range of people, not any single person.&quot; But Obama's campaign says it appeared to be a swipe at him, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Bush's remarks were &quot;beneath the dignity of the office of the president and unworthy of our representation&quot; at the celebration of Israel's 60th anniversary.</p>
<p>Referring to Sen. John McCain, Pelosi said: &quot;I would hope that any serious person that aspires to lead the country, would disassociate themselves from those comments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Pelosi was speaking,&nbsp;House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel issued a statement in which he said: &quot;The tradition has always been that when a U.S. president is overseas, partisan politics stops at the water's edge. President Bush has now taken that principle and turned it on its head: for this White House, partisan politics now begins at the water&rsquo;s edge, no matter the seriousness and gravity of the occasion.

Did I read this right? Speaker Pelosi is a "traitor" for daring to speak with a country we don't have good relations with? I wonder if some of you could have survived under Reagan.</p>

					<p>You notice that the biggest reactions are coming from those that have been advocating talking with the enemy, namely Syria (wants to destroy Lebanon, tried to build a nuclear reactor), Iran (killing our soldiers every day in Iraq with their IED's they have been supplying to the insurgents, wants to destroy Israel.) I don'y know about you, but it has been my experience that if you wan to find gasoline, strike a match.  These are the Appeasers in Chief.  Especially Obama.  Check out his bill @. 2433). He wants to subjugate the United States to the United Nations.</p>

					<p>Typical Lib attack. Don't discuss whether the truth was spoken but attack the person or some other extraneous associated principle. He spoke the truth and it is about time someone did. Democrats are a bunch of cowards and they certainly don't support free speech but rather limiting it with political correctness. We need more leaders like GW instead of Barack Clintons that want to form a committe and debate the best way to appease terrorists. I agree with Steven that Pelosi is a friend of our enemies. Vote Libertarian!</p>

					<p>Again we see the complete deceit of anyone who has worked for the Clintons by that political hack Emanuel saying "partisan politics stops at the water's edge" - where was this fool's moral outrage with  Carter and his shameless and endless attempts to use partisan politics to remove his legacy of being the worst president of the 20th Century?</p>

					<p>Nancy Pelosi should put a sock in it. This is the poster child of incompetence, who goes and meets with Syria like a traitor. Obama is going to have to come up with something more convincing than his empty words when it comes to his willingness to negotiate with any terrorist and despot, while accusing Bush of "attacking him" for pointing out the foolishness of such approach. Obama is Carter part 2, Nancy Pelosi is just a plain disgrace. She is asking Bush if he has no shame???? If that's not the pot calling the kettle black....</p>

					<p>Laughable. Typical Lib. To think every statement is directed personally. If the shoe fits Pelosi. I see the dems. had no beef with Patty Murray and Pelosi et. al. going abroad and committing nothing short of treason during wartime. It has been my experience that when someone takes offense to an issue such as this, the statement President Bush made must have hit very close to home. Obama DID say he wanted to negotiate with the terrorists, and so did that embarrasment of an American called Carter. So if they believe in what they say, why are they taking offense to it? Pelosi has been a non-entity in the house and should be embarrassed at the non-accomplishments of her regime.</p>

					<p>Democrats refuse to stand behind Israel (the only democratic country in the region).  Bush's statement was only to correct the blatant errors of former 1 term President Carter.  The Jimmy Carter's of the world are going to give our country away if we have to follow the likes of Rep. Pelosi or Sen. Obama.  Policies and politicians that equivocate with anti-Israeli parties only strenghten the enemy and make the America less safe.  Obama and Pelosi clearly either don't care or are anti-American.</p>

					<p>Wake up America! The Democrat leadership aims to sissify our military and foreign policies.  It started with Carter, then with Billary Clinton.  Reagan and Bushes stopped it.  Now Obama will surely want us to have a girlie military and appeasement-type foreign policy.  Dems are true blue socialists.</p>

Didn't Bush Senior negotiate with Muammar Qaddaffi the Lybian leader and terrorist sponsor responsible for the boming of PanAm 103?  Bush doesn't make a valid point (he's once again appealing to the lowest common denominator by fear mongering) because clearly terrorism has been thriving under his policies, which have included everything but diplomacy and an attempt at dialogue. Is it completely unreasonable to express that or dare I say attempt it before we launch the dogs of war (again)?</p>

But thats beside the point... while I am neither for or against Obama yet, I can't believe the traitor Pelosi would have the gall to make this accusation after she completely misrepresented the US and the Israeli stance in the middle east.  Whether Bush's comment is right or wrong (which can definitely be argued) criticism coming from someone who legitimately committed an act of treason based on her job description, is truly laughable.</p>

The Dem's are projecting their fear that they are percieved as weak on national defense and foreign policy. President Bush did not refer to Obama or make the statement in political terms, but the Dem's took it that way because they know the perception is in fact reality.

					<p>President Bush said the right thing.  Obama has said he will talk with anyone and everyone, including Iran and Syria.  Doesn't he realize that Iran wants to not only eliminate Israel, but he also hates the United States.  Bush is showing Obama that he has no substance.  Obama's one quality is his ability to smooth talk naive, especially the very young, into believing that everyone is just sweet and nice, and if you just talk to them they will be wonderful! You know, like Hitler. Now THAT is naive!
The best quality that Bush has is he does whats best for the USA and doesn't let the liberal media's agenda of getting democrats elected, sway his policies.  Bush may end up being one of the best presidents this country has ever had.</p>

					<p>This would seem to be a case of the pot calling the kettle black.  What about all those unauthorized trips to conduct foreign relations with enemy states that Ms. Pelosi and those of her political ilk have taken ove the past years.  Not to mention the pot shots they have taken against the President when on these journeys. 
Further, nothing of what the President said is untrue.  Obama did state several times over, showing his inexperience, that he would talk to the terrorist, Iran, North Korea.  In fact that is what his entire foreign policy would be if elected, he would talk to those that seek our destruction.  I think that this is just one more example of Obama showing that he can not handle any criticism.  I shudder to think that this is the individual that some people want as the next President.  As the old saying goes, talk is cheap.</p>

The real story here is why all the constant fuss to appear strong on Israeli security.  Our policies with the Iranians have been ineffective.  The mullahs/Guardian Council aren't stupid enough to want to start a war with Israel, so relax.  We need to engage them and settle these problems as realists, not ostrich-like, myopic xenophobes.</p>

					<p>Since common sense and decency are not good enough reasons for engaging in dialoge with your enemy why not look at it from a purely financial perspective.  

The Iraq war (only five years old) has already cost over $700 billion dollars. If we stay for another few years and add a war with Iran, how much are we willing to spend?  Another $700 billion?  One trillion?  How much?  This is money we don't have so we have to issue more Treasury bonds to China and Saudi Arabia and if the national debt keeps increasing the credit rating of the US Federal government will drop which means the government will have to finance these wars at a higher interest rate and the national debt will sprial out of control and eventually cause the US dollar to be worthless.  

So to all of you who are beating your chests and crying for military action in Iran, try to think about the financial cost of such action and then maybe you would consider an approach of negotiation first. The only costs of negotiation are a plane flight and meals for the negotiators.  I'll take option B.</p>

					<p>So many of the posters here seem to be missing the point - wandering in the woods of partisan politics in an ugly way.  The point is that official Americans abroad, whether they be Presidents or lesser representatives of our Country, do not engage in partisan politics when representing our Country.  This is for a very good reason.  We need to project unity abroad - we need to be seen as a country behind clear goals.  Of course those from other countries realize that we have a highly charged election campaign going on here in the USA, but a speech in Israel is no place for the President to engage in this kind of divisive and misleading rhetoric.  

As an aside, there is nothing in Senator Obama's past statements that would lead President Bush to conclude he wants to negotiate with terrorists.  Quite the contrary. 

But we do need to talk with our adversaries - not terrorists.  We can't just exist in a closed loop and talk only with those we approve of.  Please see Secretary Gates' comments on this very issue.  He's a grown-up and a realist on this and calls for further contact with Iran.</p>

For Bush to insert a political dig is yet more evidence that he is a silly man imitating a grown-up. Can't you just picture his smirk as he uncorked that curveball? No, probably not; this is the last refuge of Bush's 29% approval rating. Pelosi a traitor? Get real. How many deaths are on her hands? Oh, I forgot. The buck never stops with this president.

					<p>It really seems Obama and Nancy are both extra sensitive these days. It is a historical FACT (no name calling , no arguments, end of story) that many appeasers throughout history have created worse problems by their lack of decision.  If Barack feels he is on the wrong side of history, let him.     If he is feeling guilty he should see a therapist, not drag the country into it.</p>

					<p>Hey Nance,

It looked like the Israelis enjoyed our President's speech as much as the Syrians enjoyed you coming to town or Hamas enjoyed Carter visiting them or as much as the Hamas official supported Obama's run for the Presidency.  

Is it only a problem for you when one of our leaders agrees with a staunch ally like Israel?</p>

					<p>If the shoe (or is that pew) fits! In 1976 we made a stupid choice to elect  a novice President who "so well understood Iran" that we had our embassy overrun and our citizens held hostage. Even a failed rescue didn't save that loser from himself. Pelosi and her dumocrat friends really think Obama has a prayer of winning. It isn't racist,(as the dumbocrats say when anything is said); but as we learn more about him, I think he'll lose by 30 points and cost the dumocrats the House and Senate. I voted for Hillary, at least she has some B---s.</p>

					<p>For all those in favor of diplomacy, exactly where did diplomacy get us with North Korea during the Clinton administration?  If I remember, we offered them significant economic incentives to "mothball" their nuclear program only to find out later that not only did they not "mothball" the program, but they expanded it.  Now we have the Syrians using the proliferated technology to try to build their own nuclear facility.  Sounds to me like diplomacy worked like a charm.</p>

					<p>How much longer will we sit and watch these idiots get nothing done and instead argue over irrelavent comments.  Who cares what Bush says, its not the first dumb thing.  The worst part is the Dems do nothing but wine and complain, instead of doing something.  The R's are putting this election on a platter for you to take and you all wrong in your approach.  With Nancy Pelosi, worst politician let alone speaker, this country has ever seen you just might be able to mess this election up too, and then you can wine and complain about McCain for four years.  As a 24 year old is unbelievable to me that these totally self serving dems are in it for nothing else but votes and money, and the Dem following just blindly follows behind.  If I have learned something is that 50% of American(Dems) would rather have someone else do their thinking while they drive their Prius (which do not help the environment by the way).</p>

					<p>To talk with someone implies they have the same general frame of reference, a basis from which a meaningful dialogue can occur. Both sides are making the same mistake, the Democrats in assuming they can talk with terrorists whose entire agenda is about control and violence and the President who believes democracy can simply be imported into a culture that never has known the same moorings that make such a society possible in the West. Two sides of the same coin and the results will be the same.</p>

They obviously want to make an issue out of nothing and raise some funds from the more radical members of their base.  Bush is correct in his comments.  Obama is completely full of himself for thinking Bush was specifically referring to him.  And the Dems are the ones playing politics with the President overseas and should be ashamed of themselves.  The Dems take advantage of every opportunity they have to defend working with terrorists and attacking our defenders.  Obama might have more ground to stand on in this issue if he weren't personal friends with known terrorists.</p>

"Did I read this right? Speaker Pelosi is a "traitor" for daring to speak with a country we don't have good relations with? I wonder if some of you could have survived under Reagan."

Darn SKIPPY you read this right!  Reagan probably WOULD have gone to the country "we don't have good relations with" - BUT Reagan would have been talking softly with a BIG stick in his hand!  Reagan didn't "negotiate" with Gorby!  He basically told him he would run out of butter (food) before we would (ie Russia would starve trying to keep up with our Star Wars program).  Gorby understood this and down came the Berlin Wall.</p>

Israel, a country without a Constitution, run by military officers, whose own Arab Israeli citizens are treated with contempt, who violates International Law and perpetuates a raison d'etre based on European guilt, has not done one positive thing to pay back American money or good will.  
They defy us, they endanger us and they are living in the past.  This is an anti-Israeli rant, not an anti-Semite rant.  Israel has Arabs citizens, who are in fact Semitic.</p>

					<p>First, it is very telling that as soon as the president makes a general comment on the danger of appeasers, Democrats jump up to respond to the insult, thereby confirming they are the appeasers the president refers to.  It would have been smarter to (falsely) claim they don't know who he's talking about.  Second, when did Democrats ever stop practicing politics at the waters edge.  I have heard the rule many times, and have never seen the Democrats obey it.  Liberal Democrats are always eager to trash America in front of any fawning and adoring America hating audience they come accross (google Al Gore, Jimmy Carter, Michael Moore).  If you think Democrats show contempt for America here (us bitter, gun toting, rascist bible clingers), listen to what they say about us when their abroad.  Though I concede liberals probably don't hate America as much as they say, they just feel compelled to pander to foreigners who hate us.  Betraying their fellow Americans to curry favor is easier than fighting for us.</p>

					<p>Has Pelosi gone totally mad? Israel exists as a direct consequence of what Hitler did. Chamberlain's appeasement is a major reason Hitler was emboldened to do what he did. Bush was speaking at a commemoration of the formation of the state of Israel. His comments were therefore perfectly appropriate. 

I don't even know how to characterize Pelosi's response. Stupid? Out-of-touch? Manipulative? I just don't know.

I do know this: it is very, very sad.</p>

She wishes Bush was talking about Obama just so she could make an issue out of it, but Obama is such a lightweight (where is the Gravitas?) that no serious wonk would even bother.  But Pelosi is a Hack, just like all Democrats, and finds negativity and fear mongering under every rock in this election year.
If any of them had an ounce of wisdom to go with their enthusiasm for finger pointing, the world would suddenly end.  One can only hope</p>

					<p>To "Bush is evil Mike"  sir that is an ignorant statement.  A man that gets intelligence briefings we do not can make decisions that affect this country.  Has there been a second major attack on this country?  That is pretty evil Mike.
Pelosi and Obama think it is a good idea to negotiate with terrorists.  They have a clouded, at best, knowledge of history.  One can only negotiate when you are victorious.   We are not victorious yet.  If the politicians would stop trying to run wars we would be.</p>

Just listen to them howl in pain!  Listen, my mindless friends, your pain is nothing compared to what it will be over the next eight years when Pelosi and Reid rule over large majorities and Obama will rule the executive branch. Pelosi will possibly prove to be the most successful and powerful leader of the House in American history. Oh, the agony you in are for....</p>

I would hate to have someone open the lines of communication in an effort to stop terrorist attacks, bring stability to the region, and our energy situation.  I love it that we throw our hands in the air and say, "This will all fix itself if we maintain our resolve."  And the last thing we want to do is pander to a bunch of Muslims!</p>

					<p>ABC reporter pointed out that Bush had said these things before. MSNBC reporter claimed that Obama did not favor talks without preconditions; he conflated preconditions and preparations, as Obama has sometimes hinted as he tried to back down from his statement at a debate. An Obama representative immediately said the opposite: that Bush was confusing preconditions with preparations, thus distinguishing between them as the MSNBC reporter implicitly claimed Obama was not doing. I guess the MSNBC reporter didn't get the memo; he spoke too soon after the Bush speech, before he could advert to what the Obama representative was saying.</p>

					<p>Hezbollah last year attacked Israel and is now at war with Lebanon, and for the record it is a terrorist organization backed by Iran. So in these times when terrorist organization wage wars against sovereign nations, and make terrorist attacks on the soil of other countries (India, UK, Spain, 9/11) talking with the backers of those organizations rather than crushing them is an invitation to be raped and Obama's gesture is just that.

Why would America elect a weak, elitist with zero experience? Just because America feels its time to elect a Black? If so why not elect a qualified Black man like Colin Powell?

Bush us right in his speech to the Knesset, and all the screaming Democrats once again prove that they don't have the brains or guts to ensure America's security.

Clinton did not act strongly after bomb attacks on our embassies, USS Cole and the first attack on Twin Towers, which led to 9/11.

Obama is already signaling appeasement to terrorists and zealot butchers. What's next - a deal with drug dealers and cartels?

I was born in India therefore see the sin and folly of a soft approach to terrorists. As recently as 2 days ago 61 people were killed in bomb blasts by Muslim terrorists. And the Indian government as a policy, unlike Bush, and LIKE OBAMA, believes in engagement and negotiations, which HAVE NOT WORKED FOR 60 YEARS, so India and Indians keep getting attacked.

America electing Obama is inviting attacks on America and Americans. Electing Democrats for the matter as politically correct rhetoric doesn't work with Mullah trained zealots, firepower does.</p>

					<p>Hey Politico...do you realize that someone just called for the assassination of the POTUS right here on this blog?  I hope you have alerted  the Secret Service!  Here is his comment...
"Most people including world leaders think that Bush is a nitwit. He is laughable. I have never seen a more ridiculous figure than Bush sitting in a schoolroom being told that the US was under attack. To say that he looked mentally challenged would be an understatement. He looked downright retarded. He is Ufuss-The-Dufuss come to life. A clown dog - "Bring them on!" he said of the terrorists, and so they did. The only thing Bush forgot to tell them is that he would provide the body bags for America's finest young men. How many more body bags does he have stored at his ranch? How many more fine young people will die because of him. A bunch of radicals from Saudi Arabia destroy the twin towers and he sends troops to be slaughtered in Iraq. To put it mildly, he should be shot and ****ed-on for the total disregard he has shown for the people he is suppose to protect. He's a Goof."

					<p>What are you TALKING about? What's hypocritical about Pelosi negotiating with Syria and criticizing Bush's anti-negotiation stance? I may not agree with it, but there's no hypocracy there.

All the crazy right-wingers link to here from the Drudge Report. Only now do I truly see how far the once great Republican party has fallen. You people can't even construct a simple and logically correct syllogism</p>

					<p>For Nancy Pelosi or any Dem to talk about the dignity of the office is laughable. I guess having sex with unpaid interns is fine. Going to Syria or speaking with Hamas (Carter) is fine in their book, but let Pres. Bush make a general comment and he is attacked. The Dems and lefties call Pres. Bush all sorts of vile names and refer to him as a monkey (showing their true immature character) instead of voicing a civil disagreement of ideas. Bush graciously defended Pelosi's use of a jet to fly home to CA all the time and she pays him back this way? She is a Nazi as the house speaker and has done absolutely nothing for the American people other than take our money.  When will the average working class American rise up and go down to Wash DC and protest these Dem idiots? We pay taxes and have to put up with the protests of all sorts of deluded lefties, Dem do nothings yet we remain silent.</p>

					<p>What a bunch of red-neck capitalist gangster yahoos to think you don?t negotiate with your adversaries.  If you ask the ?terrorist? people what they want they will not say we are against your way of life and want to kill you? our adversaries have a laundry list too.  For instance? if we were to pull out of Saudi Arabia in a few stages over a five year period?we would not have to take our shoes off at the airport.  But our government and our business interests feel that a few thousand lives and the threat of death is good for business and  is a small price to pay for the appearance of ?cheap? Arab oil which ain?t cheap with the end result being that Americans worry about their safety rather than about the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  

You guys are idiots?of course one negotiates!  And?you do it in private and ignore the red-meat that they throw to their own starving people?that they should worry about America and Israel instead of their empty stomachs.</p>

					<p>At the end of the day it is the party of Carter, Clinton, Pelosi, Durbin et al who have tried with all of their might to arrogantly infringe their world-view on those who are much more interested in killing and maiming. Clinton got Israel to agree to all sorts of nonsense and Yassar Arafat walked away from the table. of negotiations. Before 9/11, America was being attacked going back to the '80's with the Marine barracks bombing followed by Leon Klinghoffer, continuing to 1993 at the World Trade Center and even more death and destruction on the U.S.S. Cole and various U.S. Embassy's across the world. America's problem was and remains it's restraint. Ms. Pelosi is very fortunate that she resides in San Fransisco and not in Israel where walking to a supermarket could lead to death. Ms. Pelosi obviously doesn't understand the ramifications of continuing the same failed approaches to the Middle East and obviously doesn't realize that without Israel being able to defend itself that what you currently see happening over there will be nothing compared to the genocide surely to take place shold we continue to handicap Israel's ability to defend itself.</p>

					<p>Yeah & what Slick Willie was doing with Monica Lewinski in the oval office was also beneath the dignity of the office and none of the Democraps cared then!  If old Hillhump gets elected back into the white house, Slick Willie's official title will probably be "the first gentleman". Why not just make Slick Willie's official title "the first pervert" if old Hillhump gets elected?  President Bush has made some mistakes but one thing he did not do was turn the white house into a whore house. Nancy Pelosi is beneath anyone's dignity!</p>

					<p>Maybe, he was actually refering to President Jimmy Carter? Anyway, it is true that Obama said he would sit down with terrorists (Irans Leader,Castro, etc.), so actually he only has himself to blame. We Democrats can only expect more from the Republicans since we have decided to nominate Obama over Clinton. As to Rahm Emanuel he is probably the most partisan member of Congress and should guard his words when pointing his finger at Republicans for partisanship.</p>

					<p>Ralph's obviously never heard Reagan's "Evil Empire" bit or the "tear down this wall" speech. 

Pelosi and Obama are obviously stung, to the point that they are now self-inflicting wounds, like people who slap themselves to get the swarming bees off.  When you own criticisms that aren't  directed at you by name, you automatically associate yourselves with them.  

Obama's camp could have simply said, "we agree and that's why we want to negotiate only with legitimate actors in the region" and left the definition open to debate.  Instead, he and Nancy "Foot-in-mouth" Pelosi have left no doubt that they want to negotiate with people that reasonable observers could classify as "terrorists and radicals."

Not very swift.</p>

					<p>Again this constant protection of Obama by everyone just makes him look weak.  They should have just left the comment alone. By saying anything it looks like "poor me, I'm getting picked on".  It comes off as immature.  It also reminds people of what was perceived as a very naive statement Senator Obama made about meeting with the Iranian President.

Negotiations should definetly start and we need communication, but it should be up to the Secretary of State of lower level officials until we see an openess to actually talk without it turning into propaganda.</p>

					<p>Bush has not done a single effective thing regarding the Iran problem. He sits in the corner mumbling while they continue their march toward nukes. We need a leader who is not AFRAID to look them in the eye and tell them what we think. Bush and McCain are cowards. Reagen had the guts to look Gorbachev in the eye. Nixon had the guts to go to red China. Bush and McCain cower in fear...</p>

					<p>/sigh

Just another example of why partisan politics is destroying this once great country.  People need to seriously wake up.  Neither the Republicans or Democrats represent you!  They aren't looking out for American interests, they are just trying to maintain their hegemonic grip on power in this country by any means necessary!!  They applaud when the US suffers under the other party's leadership, because they think it will strengthen them the next election cycle.

Bush, McCain, Obama, Pelosi, Clinton and every Dem/Rep....all of them are myopic and parochial shills for their party, and they are NOT worried about America's interests, they are only worried about their own self-interested parties.</p>

					<p>SENATOR BARACK OBAMA SAID IT BEFORE! GEORGE BUSH JNR HAS A THIRD TERM AGENDA. BUSH IS OBVIOUSLY PLAYING TO THE GALLERY BY DEDUCING THAT SOME OF HIS COUNTRYMEN - WITH SENATOR OBAMA DEMS IN MIND - WANT AMERICA TO NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS. HE'S UNWITTING PUSHING HIS THIRD TERM AGENDA AS ALLEGED BY SENATOR OBAMA. AMERICANS MUST NOT ALLOW HIM TO CONTINUE UNDER ANY DISGUISE THROUGH HIS SURROGATE ? SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN</p>

					<p>Isn't it amazing that she's so quick to criticize the President, whose statements hit the target squarely in the center of the bullseye. I wonder if she's hoping he won't specifically mention her trip to Syria, which (oh, by the way) was clearly in violation of her Constitutional authority. (Only the Executive Branch is granted authority for foreign relations. So, for her to travel to Syria on the government's (taxpayers') dime was a clear violation of her Constitutional authority.) Since she was clearly a traitor, who will launch the impeachment?</p>

					<p>funny Pelosi did not have anything to say when Carter was talking with Hamas.. liberal jokers

No, she didn't.  But Obama did.  Look it up!  

I agree we should be cautious, but I agree we should talk with other heads of state.  Talking is one thing, negotiating is another.  As long as conversation continues, so hope remains.  We're the ones who pushed Hussein into power and we're the ones who helped Iran in the years prior to the hostage crisis.  We're not entirely blameless - unfortunately.  It's a fine line.  We should therefore tread lightly.</p>
