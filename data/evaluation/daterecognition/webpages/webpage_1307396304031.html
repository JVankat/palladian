        <p align="justify">Why is it that in spite of all these great sages and
        their teachings
        no change has taken place in our lives? We are still trapped on the
        same merry-go-round. Probably because we have not undergone one
        fundamental preliminary, and that is an inner awakening. We seem to
        be externally awake all the time, but inwardly we are fast asleep. We
        buy these big tomes of scriptures and use them as pillows, hoping
        that the message will somehow jump out of the covers and into our
        heads. It does not happen. And when we go to listen to these great
        men, we are definitely psychologically asleep, and very often even
        physically asleep!
        <p align="justify">
        What is the first and foremost condition or qualification for being a
        true follower, a true disciple, or for even taking up the study of a
        scripture seriously? This definition is very beautifully put in that
        lovely scripture called the Yoga Vasistha. The fundamental requisite
        is that there should be a clear understanding and realisation that
        &quot;I
        am trapped and I would like to be free from this trap.&quot; If this is
        not there then the scriptures and lectures have no effect on us
        whatsoever. If you have the idea: &quot;I am trapped, but I think I can
        find the way out&quot;, then also there is no awakening. `I am trapped'
        means I am trapped in every way, without redemption, without the
        possibility of an escape.
        <p align="justify">
        Take, for instance, the problem of loneliness and boredom. What do we
        do in order to overcome this boredom or loneliness? We try to escape
        into something that only confirms that loneliness. We find ourselves
        a friend (with whom we are unable to relate) and enter into a
        relationship. So together there is a boredom, together there is a
        loneliness. Or, we turn on the tape recorder or record player, but
        that does not take our boredom away. We are masking that boredom,
        that loneliness, and trying to escape from it. Thus we enter into a
        deeper, more dangerous and deadly trap. If that is not clear then the
        inner awakening is not there.
        <p align="justify">
        Is it possible to see that whatever we do we are in a trap? Anything
        that the mind creates is a trap. When there is this inner awakening
        then we will profit by scriptures and lecturesï¿½if we are not totally
        stupid and not, at the same time, enlightened. These are the
        qualifications. Totally stupid people have no problem at all, and the
        enlightened ones have no problem either. You and I, in the middle,
        are the ones harassed by problems.
        <p align="justify">
        Total stupidity takes various forms but one characteristic is the
        ability to function as if intelligent. These people shy away from
        asking the right questions and can answer all the wrong questions.
        They are philosophers who can create a sense of intelligence without
        being intelligent. What are the right questions? That is the most
        important factor. &quot;I am trapped wherever and which ever way I look.
        From morning till night I strive for happiness and I find nothing but
        unhappiness.&quot; The very fact that we continue to strive for
        happiness
        shows that we are unhappy. Face it. Whatever we do in order to
        augment our happiness only destroys it.
        <p align="justify">
        And yet intelligent people go on doing this. They want peace of mind
        and struggle for it. This struggle breaks the mind into several
        pieces. Then they catch hold of one little piece and think they are
        peaceful! That is the whole joke. Is that intelligence? Why is it
        that having understood this sequence of unfortunate events, we still
        pursue the game?
        <p align="justify">
        If it is decided that it is not possible to attain peace of mind or
        happiness here, give up. Is that possible? No. Something still stirs
        inside: &quot;I am trapped; it must be possible to get out of this; I
        would like to get out of this.&quot; If this twin aspiration is there
        and
        if you are not completely stupid or enlightened, then you can proceed
        to understand the scriptures. And where the scripture is not
        meaningful, you can also take the help of a teacher.
        <p align="justify">
        In the Katha Upanishad there is a beautiful declaration: uttishthata
        jagrataï¿½wake up! No one else can do this for you. You can be the
        disciple of God Almighty Himself, but even He will not be able to
        wake up on your behalf. If you feel hungry, you yourself must eat.
        The guru is not going to do the eating for you. The guru may indicate
        to you, but it is your problem. And if you feel it is your problem,
        then you awaken, and then you are awake to the problem.
        <p align="justify">
        Unless you stop blaming others, including yourself, for the state you
        are in, you are not awake. When you are walking through a tunnel, you
        see the light in front of you and the light behind you. Even so, when
        you are in darkness you think you see some light in the past or in
        the future. It is an absurd pastime.
        <p align="justify">
        Therefore, a major qualification for the student of yoga is to
        realise that no one is responsible for the state you are in. No one
        can bring about a spiritual awakening in you. Someone can help,
        anyone can help, but you have to do it. This spiritual awakening is
        brought about by life itself, but even to be awakened by life, a
        certain grace and a certain inner alertness is necessary.
        <p align="justify">
        Waking up is easy, but to remain awake is not so easy. Those of you
        who have attempted to wake up early in the morning in order to
        meditate will appreciate this. You set an alarm clock, it rings and
        you wake up. But to remain awake after that is not so easy. The mind
        loves to sleep. Why? Because the mind is born of ignorance and
        therefore it loves sleep and it loves a thick psychological blanket.
        <p align="justify">
        Therefore, wake up! That is your problem, your responsibility, not
        the teacher's. From there on, ever be vigilant. Whenever I use this
        word `vigilant', I am reminded of Buddha's famous teaching. In some
        texts it is said that during one of the Buddha's last sermons, he
        told his disciples: &quot;Live in this world as you would if you were
        living in a room with a live cobra at the door.&quot; Can you imagine
        that? If you were in a small single room which had only one door and
        no windows, nothing to escape by, and you found a cobra sitting by
        that door in the middle of the night, what would you do? Would you
        sleep? Would you even nod? How vigilant you would be! Such must be
        the vigilance of the seeker.
        <p align="justify">
        It is possible for us to develop this vigilance if we understand that
        we are trapped and that whatever we do to get out of this trap leads
        us into a greater trap. Because the mind arises in ignorance and
        plays in ignorance, it can only create restlessness and disturb our
        peace. It may at times generate a feeling of happinessï¿½which is a
        mere state of confusion. (If you have ever had true happiness for
        fifteen seconds, why did you give it up? Because it was not happiness
        at all!) If everything that we did ended in failure, we would stop
        doing anything. So the mind leads us from one unhappiness to another,
        and makes us feel sometimes that we are enjoying ourselves. That is
        the game the mind plays. When this understanding arises, what happens
        is vigilance.
        <p align="justify">
        If you are awake and alert, can you not discover the truth concerning
        life? With what does one discover the truth? Thought and mind cannot
        discover the truth because they are born of ignorance. What else do
        we have? There the questioner comes to an end. We can sit and think,
        but we have already understood that thinking leads us nowhere. We are
        awake, we are vigilant, but we do not know what else to do. Where do
        we go from there? Go to some enlightened person and be enlightened.
        Awakening is our job, our privilege. Enlightenment is possible with
        the help of the master. (Otherwise the danger is that we might regard
        ourselves as enlightened because our mind suggests we are enlightenedï¿½
        another trap.) So the commandment of the Upanishads is: &quot;uttishthata,
        jagrata&quot;ï¿½&quot;awake, remain alert.&quot; Go to the enlightened ones and
        attain
        enlightenment.

          the Tradition of the Himalayan masters in simple, understandable and 
          beneficial ways, while not compromising quality or depth. The goal of 
          our sadhana or practices is the highest 
          Joy that comes from the Realization in direct experience of the 
          center of consciousness, the Self, the Atman or Purusha, which is 
          one and the same with the Absolute Reality. 
          This Self-Realization comes through Yoga meditation of the Yoga 
          Sutras, the contemplative insight of Advaita Vedanta, and the 
          intense devotion of Samaya Sri Vidya Tantra, the three of which 
          complement one another like fingers on a hand. 
          We employ the classical approaches of Raja, Jnana, Karma, and Bhakti 
          Yoga, as well as Hatha, Kriya, Kundalini, Laya, Mantra, Nada, Siddha, 
          and Tantra Yoga. Meditation, contemplation, mantra and prayer 
          finally converge into a unified force directed towards the final 
          stage, piercing the pearl of wisdom called bindu, leading to the 
          Absolute.
