9 Nov 2007, 0104 hrs IST,Saurabh Sinha,TNN<br />
 <br />
 <br />
NEW DELHI: It's a double Diwali bonanza for Delhiites starved of good airports and deprived of chopper facilities. <br />
<br />
Bringing the capital closer to a second international airport, the aviation ministry has sent Uttar Pradesh government's proposal for Greater Noida airport to the Cabinet Secretariat for discussion at the highest decision-making level. <br />
<br />
In addition, Noida is in the process of finalising a 25-acre plot in sector 148 for developing a heliport by state-owned Pawan Hans Helicopters Ltd (PHHL) that could help connect the capital to nearby NCR areas by choppers. The ministry has sent the Rs 3,505 crore airport � Taj International Aviation Hub (TIAH) at Zevar, Greater Noida � proposal to the Cabinet within three months. <br />
<br />
UP CM Mayawati had presented airport proposal to PM Manmohan Singh during her first meeting with him after becoming CM. The proposal was sent to aviation minister Praful Patel after two months and Patel has forwarded it to the Cabinet in the shortest time ever, considering an airport proposal. <br />
<br />
&quot;The legal aspects of agreements with GMR-backed Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) will have to be studied as the UP site is just 72 km from IGI. The Cabinet may refer it to a GoM. The GMR group has been protesting against this move but all global cities have more than one airport and there's no reason why Delhi shouldn't,&quot; said a senior official. <br />
<br />
The DIAL group says its development plan for IGI would be enough to meet Delhi's requirement for about next two decades. The finance ministry has also pointed out that developers of Delhi and Greater Noida airports should get level playing fields. <br />
<br />
UP is all set to offer 25 acres to Pawan Hans in Noida's sector 148. This site is about 35 km from the proposed airport site. The aviation ministry is also seeking sites for heliports in Delhi and some other parts of NCR for improving connectivity.</div></div><hr />

Mangalore, Nov. 16<br />
<br />
Deccan Aviation is likely to replicate its model of connecting smaller cities in its proposed international operations also. In this regard, the airline is planning to connect large Indian population in the West Asia with cities like Mangalore. <br />
<br />
This was indicated by Capt G.R. Gopinath, Executive Chairman of Deccan Aviation, here on Friday. Addressing the members of Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) here on Friday evening, he said that Deccan will launch its first international flight from August next year. <br />
<br />
Target countries <br />
<br />
<br />
International flight will be especially for West Asia countries. �We want to serve a large population of Indians in the Gulf with our international initiative. And the first international flight from Deccan will be from Mangalore to Gulf countries,�he said. <br />
<br />
Currently Deccan connects 66 locations in the country with its fleet of 45 aircraft. <br />
<br />
He termed Re 1 ticket marketing of the company helped the people of India to travel in aircraft. This created a huge inflow of passengers to aircraft. <br />
<br />
Stating the growth story of Deccan Aviation as the story of New India, he said: �For Indians golden age is not behind, it is ahead of them.�</div></div><hr />

T AKING forward Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati's pet project for a Taj International Aviation Hub (TIAH), the Civil Aviation Ministry has put its stamp of approval in a Cabinet note sent to the government despite objections from the Finance Ministry. This has set the stage for what will now have to be a political decision as the Law Ministry has refused to put its comments on the note. <br />
Justifying the need for a second airport in the National Capital Region, the Civil Aviation Ministry has backed the Mayawati Government's proposal citing unprecedented air traffic growth and the fact that all major global cities like London and New York have more than one airport. <br />
<br />
At the heart of the matter is the 1997 airport infrastructure policy that does not permit development of a greenfield airport within 150 km (aerial distance) of an existing airport. The UP Government has proposed a site, Jevar, that is 68 km from the present Delhi airport. <br />
<br />
The Rs 3,505-crore project is ambitious and would be spread across 1,500 hectares of land. The main sponsoring authority will be the Taj Expressway Authority that will, in consultation with the State Government, make available the land to either a SPV or a developer. It will be a joint venture with the state holding 26 per cent. Uttar Pradesh is open to considering an AAI stake within the 26 per cent at a later date. <br />
<br />
The projected revenue is to the tune of nearly Rs 170 crores in 2011 and, according to the Cabinet proposal, is set to grow to around Rs 2,187 crores by 2038. The State Government proposes to sign no concession agreement, only a land lease agreement. <br />
<br />
On the issue of diverting air traffic from Delhi airport, the Civil Aviation Ministry has backed the assessment of the UP Govern ment's feasibility study that in the initial phase 5 per cent traffic will be diverted, which will go up to 15 per cent by 2035. As for cargo traffic, 8 per cent of Delhi cargo will be diverted by 2011 that will go up to 20 per cent in 2035. <br />
<br />
In all, the projected traffic volume for TIAH is 3.9 million in 2011, which would grow to 82.6 million over the next 25 years. On the other hand, DIAL plans to touch 37 million by 2010 and 100 million by 2036. <br />
<br />
With ministries taking different positions on according in-principle approval to the project, the decision before the Cabinet, sources say, cannot be bereft of political consideration given the kind of real estate interest the mere news of the project has generated. <br />
<br />
In fact, the Cabinet proposal itself projects the proposal as a major catalyst to developing SEZs and tourist facilities in the area</div></div><hr />

<br />
what other new things to tackle heavy traffic will be installed to maintain the distance between two aircraft to avoid accidents?   By next year i read that Gagan System will be operationalized with a resolution of 1 meter, will that be big advantage for aircraft navigation? or normal GPS is fine?<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
A journey of a thousand miles, said Chinese thinker Confucius, begins with a single step. For Indian aviation, the climb has been mostly uphill, but it has been taking those little steps that matter. By Rupkamal Sarma <br />
<br />
The Indian skies, pregnant with enough airlines, are expected to witness even heavier traffic in the coming years. This translates into the need for better infrastructure on ground. The wheels, that started turning some time ago, are today in full motion. <br />
<br />
From a service that few could afford, flying has become available to a magnitude of consumers. Rapid evolution of low-cost carriers and public and private airlines has left the tarmac open for competition. All kinds of carriers - from cargo to no-frills and international budget carriers, especially Asian low-cost carriers - are also making a beeline to India. All this translates into increased demands on the airports. By 2020, Indian airports are estimated to handle:<br />
<br />
100 million passengers <br />
Including 60 million domestic passengers <br />
Cargo in the range of 3.4 million tons per annum <br />
The government's airport modernisation plan proposes investments of US$ 9 billion by 2010. In January 2006, joint venture companies with 74 per cent private sector participation won contracts to upgrade New Delhi and Mumbai airports. Mass upgradation of airports across the country is going on at all levels. Not only international airports but greenfield airports as well are been developed and unused air strips are been revamped. The government plans to develop around 300 unused airstrips across India - a move that has raised projections for jets required for regional connectivity. Boeing and Airbus, along with Embraer (Brazil), Bombardier (Canada), Sukhoi (Russia), ATR (France) and BAE System (UK) are keen to tap the emerging regional jet market in the country. <br />
<br />
Ground zero<br />
<br />
While there is no doubt about the excitement happening in air, the ground is where all the action begins. Last year witnessed the restructuring and modernisation of the two international airports in Mumbai and Delhi through the public-private partnership (PPP) mode. Due to its success, the model is being used to develop all international airports in the country. <br />
<br />
International airports are a significant part of the infrastructure within a country, not only in terms of passenger movement and goods but also in creating good first impressions for anyone visiting the country.<br />
<br />
A common feature across all the international airports is the development and upgradation of new terminals, runways and increased passenger amenities. There is also an increased awareness to create a technology-driven business environment. <br />
<br />
Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport: The Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) is evidently the busiest airport in India. On an average, it handles close to 625-650 Air Traffic Movements (ATMs) in a day since close to 40 per cent of India's air traffic is routed through Mumbai. The airport has eight domestic airlines and 46 international airlines operating out of its terminals. This has put a lot of pressure on the existing facilities. <br />
<br />
One of the major changes proposed at CSIA is to have one integrated passenger terminal at Sahar that will have the capacity to handle 40 million passengers annually. Moreover, MIAL has plans to construct a domestic Terminal 1C at Santacruz to connect the existing two terminals - 1A and 1B. This terminal amongst other things will include space for hotel and office development, transfer and immigration facilities for international passengers. <br />
<br />
Bangalore International Airport Limited: BIAL has selected the Oberoi Group to operate a first class international hotel under the Trident Hilton brand, besides a host of world-class names like HMS Host and Nuance Group from Zurich, Switzerland to handle travel operations and F&amp;B outlets. <br />
<br />
Delhi International Airport Limited: In Delhi, DIAL is responsible for constructing Terminal 3 (T3). A master plan 'Vision 2020' was made for the airport which would cater to both domestic and international traffic. The terminal would be ready before the Commonwealth Games in 2010. With a total investment of Rs 8,900 crore, the first phase will see the airport capacity increase to 37 million passengers. This will be built with an ultimate design capacity of 100 million passengers based on a modular expansion plan that can develop more terminals with increasing traffic. <br />
<br />
This future-ready terminal will be spread over a 4,80,000 sq m and will be among the best airports of the world with a CAT III B landing system. It would boast of facilities like 74 aerobridges, 30 remote stands, a total of 200 parking stands for aircraft, 130 check-in counters and 23 self check-in counters, 146 emigration counters, an advanced in-line baggage handling system, rail connectivity for the city centre, automated passenger movers for easy intra-terminal connectivity along with a number of airport hotels, executive lounges, shopping and recreational facilities. New rapid exit taxiways, parallel and link taxiways for faster aircraft clearance, additional aircraft stands with CAT III lighting, modern follow-me vehicles assisting in low visibility conditions are also being devised. <br />
<br />
Chennai International Airport: Expansion in Chennai is happening on similar lines. Its Security Hold Area (SHA) is being developed and the ground floor has already been expanded towards the air side to provide more space to passengers. AAI now plans to install escalators to create a new SHA on the first floor, thereby diverting traffic and effectively managing congestion. <br />
<br />
AAI added about 1,200 sq m of additional space to the international departure terminal in December last year. New modern trolleys with extra maneuverability were introduced. A new feature at the terminal is the revolving glass door that will have automatic security locks. <br />
<br />
Prior to April 2006, jostling one's way through the departure gate was like getting past the pearly gates. It was a single-point departure with an extremely small check-in area. The need for expansion made the planners use the previously under-utilised space, which resulted in the creation of some 1,000 sq m. It has a dedicated traffic lane from the terminal from where five airlines can take off. Feedback forms show that foreign visitors to the airport have expressed satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile a new block is under construction at two levels, which would add about 10,000 sq mts inclusive of both the levels. The authorities also plan to install an escalator that will help decongest the area during arrival times. An in-line baggage inspection system has been introduced along with a new type of carousal baggage conveyor system instead of the flap-type conveyors.<br />
<br />
It is also building a Departure II terminal and one can see the changes, right from the corridor outside the domestic terminal with a glass wall (that will be extended to the entire fa�ade of the airport both in the domestic and international terminals) where the over-walked tiles are replaced by vitrified anti-skid floor tiles. The change is more visible inside the passenger lounge. The same flooring continues inside and is spotted with plants. Sleek LCD screens adorn the walls and pillars; one LCD screen gives discerning passengers a map of the airport. <br />
<br />
There is also a decent food court. The black signboards with white letters look aesthetic when compared with the old yellow ones. Check-in areas and visitor's lobbies have also seen expansions but the work is still in progress. Ample seating space and massage chairs (recliners) have made waiting comfortable. <br />
<br />
Pay phones have been installed inside the passenger lounge but the latest addition to Departure II is the music kiosks, where songs can be downloaded legally and cheaply for as low as Rs 5 into iPods, Mp3 players, pen drives and CDs. The initial phase of the new airport will be capable of handling 12 mppa and more than 1,00,000 tons of cargo per annum. The ultimate capacity of the airport is over 50 mppa and 1 million ton.<br />
<br />
Rajiv Gandhi International Airport: The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad is evidently built to be the most modern airport in India and will start operations from March 2008. Modelled after the Munich airport, it will boast of a plethora of features like the tallest ATC tower in India and accommodation of Code F aircraft like the A380.<br />
<br />
A 1,05,300 sq mts terminal, having the capacity to handle 12 million passengers per annum, is being constructed. The terminal building will have 12 contact and 30 remote stands for aircraft parking. Other buildings that will be constructed include the ATC Tower, Technical Building, Cargo (1,00,000 ton capacity), MRO, CFR Station (Crash, Fire and Rescue Station) and utilities having a combined area of 35,000 sq mts. <br />
<br />
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport: Ashok Chawla, secretary, Union ministry of civil aviation, had recently said, &quot;We are making a sincere attempt to give Kolkata a world-class airport and integrated terminal building.&quot; It is learnt that the modernisation programme will be completed in three phases and is estimated to cost Rs 5,000 crore. Rs 1,500 crore has been earmarked for the job in the first phase. <br />
<br />
Of this, Rs 1,300 crore will be spent on the terminals, Rs 100 crore on the runway and a cargo complex, and the remaining Rs 100 crore on Communication &amp; Navigation Systems (CNS). Sources confirm that the globally renowned Aeroport de Paris has already prepared the design of the new terminals. As per the proposed schedule, the Kolkata Airport modernisation programme should be completed before the Commonwealth Games. <br />
<br />
The Detail Project Report (DPR) plans for two new terminals at the airport, an integrated large one for domestic and international flights, and another relatively small one just for international flights. The proposed buildings will have facilities for ground-floor arrival and first floor departure to ease congestion. <br />
<br />
There are plans to install four to five state-of-the-art aerobridges. New parking bays will be built, some attached to the terminal and others in the 'remote' areas. The road network around the terminal buildings will be upgraded. &quot;This will be taken up with the help of the state public works department,&quot; said an AAI official. <br />
<br />
To cope up with the increasing number of passengers and cars, the DPR proposes a number of underpasses and pedestrian flyovers on the approach roads from VIP Road - the road connecting the airport to the city to the Kolkata airport. There are also plans to set up two new spacious car parks. <br />
<br />
The revamped airport would be able to handle 20 million passengers annually compared to five million now. While the first terminal will have the capacity to handle 16 million passengers annually, the second will cater to four million passengers. At present, the domestic terminal handles not more than 4.5 million passengers a year and the international terminal hardly gets one million passengers. <br />
<br />
Greater Hyderabad International Airport Limited: Greater Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL) with its user-friendly modular design of the passenger terminal will initially cover 1,00,000 sq mts of floor space that would ensure rapid transit between its domestic and international concourses. The complex will have a dedicated 'Airport Village' with a local flavour. There will also be a business hotel adjacent to the terminal building.<br />
<br />
Tech it out<br />
<br />
Managing the busiest airport in India, MIAL has embarked upon a drive to create a technology-driven business environment that will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and service standards at CSIA. Says GV Sanjay Reddy, managing director of MIAL and vice chairman of GVK, &quot;We have entered into a five-year agreement with Tata Consultancy Services for IT consultancy services along with implementation and management of the technology backbone at CSIA. The scope of services covers the entire airport value chain from operations to services.&quot;<br />
In May 2007, MIAL became the first airport in India to introduce an airport management system by SITA that allowed the airport to improve performance across a wide spectrum of activities - efficient allocation of resources including departure gates, aircraft slots, check-in counters, baggage carousels and creating a state-of-the art flight information display for passengers. It also helps in effective co-ordination and real-time availability of information to airport managers and ground-handlers. As a result, CSIA has moved away from depending on manual systems to IT-driven automation, thus enabling end-to-end management of airport resources in real-time.<br />
<br />
Realising the pivotal role of the internet, the airport also became the first in the country in March 2007, to provide information and updates including real time international and domestic flight schedules on its website - www.csia.in.<br />
<br />
The consortium has also tied up with Nortel to build one of the most extensive communications infrastructure ever undertaken by an international airport in India, which includes a comprehensive communications upgrade with major data, voice, and video projects over a converged network.<br />
<br />
For travellers, the airport now provides internet connectivity thus becoming the first international airport in India to launch free wireless network providing Wi-Fi service throughout the domestic and international terminals. Soon, the airport will also introduce paid service for a bandwidth of 512 kbps and above. Free internet kiosks with a minimum of four computers will also be set up at all terminals. <br />
<br />
When Rajiv Gandhi International Airport opens in 2008 in Hyderabad, its single terminal will be equipped with contact boarding bridges, remote stands, Common User Terminal Equipment (CUTE) check-in desks, self check-in kiosks and immigration counters. It would also feature the state-of-the-art IT systems including FIDS, BHS and Airport Operational Database (AODB) technology for the first time in India. <br />
<br />
First impression, last impression<br />
<br />
Elaborating on the air side efforts, spokesperson for DIAL, Arun Arora says that in an effort to reduce the waiting time for passengers in air and on ground, improving and ensuring faster aircraft movement is important. This means that work on the new runway at T3 is moving at a fast pace. One of the longest runways in Asia, it will be operational by 2008 though the airport will open only by 2010, he cleared. He also added that its ASQ rating as of now is between 3-3.1 but once the airport is completed, it will come at par with other world standard airports to 3.5, which is the maximum any airport has got till now.<br />
<br />
Work on the new domestic terminal is underway and will be completed by middle of next year, Arora stated. The new domestic terminal will be able to handle at least 10 million passengers per year and will also get its third run way. <br />
<br />
Reigning retail <br />
<br />
Due to the improving infrastructure in airports, non-aeronautical revenues are also expected to contribute almost 50 per cent of revenues to the airports. Looking beyond the cosmetic changes, the developers are also working on a comprehensive plan to optimise the commercial revenues. Also, with the retail industry booming, various caf�s and fast food joints have opened for business at the international and domestic terminals. <br />
<br />
In February 2007, MIAL awarded the duty-free retail contract for CSIA to the Aldeasa-ITDC joint venture as a part of an international competitive bid. Reddy says, &quot;Aldeasa-ITDC is currently working on bringing a world-class duty-free experience at CSIA. Located in the international terminal 2C of the airport, the shopping area will be spread across 24,541 sq ft. Of this, 14,585 sq ft will be at the departure level, 8,395 sq ft at the arrival level and 1,560 sq ft will be for storage. They will be responsible for designing and building the shopping environment, sourcing a wide range of international luxury brands and developing a strong promotional strategy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alpha Future, a joint venture between the UK-based Alpha Airport Group and the Future Group, has opened its duty-free shops at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. It will manage one outlet in arrivals and four in departures covering an area of about 8,000 square feet. &quot;This is an attempt at bringing world class shopping to India &quot; says Arora. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sky is not the limit <br />
<br />
With successful infrastructure development, the prospects of India becoming an MRO hub and a leader in the Asia-Pacific region have also become bright. Increased activity in the MRO sector has attracted many foreign companies. Lufthansa has tied up with GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL) to open such a facility for which it intends to invest US$ 23 million. Similarly, Boeing intends to invest US$ 100 million in a facility in Nagpur. <br />
<br />
Aerotropolis, or the airport cities that are economically dependent on the airport for its existence, may be a distant reality in India. While places like Hong Kong, Beijing and Dubai are already developing Aerotropolises, Bangalore and Hyderabad are following suit. <br />
<br />
Moreover, the move to reduce dwell time of cargo from seven days to three days and possibility of using new systems like Common User Terminal System (CUTE) are positive steps. The private sector is also showing interest in the merchant airport policy, being prepared by the civil aviation ministry for building dedicated cargo airports to boost the logistics chain in the country. Airport developers in the private sector are also tying up with realty firms to help them acquire land. <br />
<br />
The ambitious Rs 644 crore GPS-based Geo Augmentation Navigation (GAGAN) project - jointly executed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Airports Authority of India, having completed its phase one, will provide augmented information for satellite navigation to aircraft flying over Indian airspace and the routes over seas. <br />
<br />
<br />
Grey clouds <br />
<br />
With all the development taking place the scene is set for giant leaps in aviation. But there are also some grey areas which need to be addressed. Vipul Jain, MD and CEO of Kale Consultants, says, &quot;At a macro level, airports need to be integrated into the urban development plan. There needs to be a synchronisation of systems for airports to be truly successful. The idea of an Aerotropolis is good on paper. But the major problem in India today is the problem of connectivity. The airport and the city should be well connected.&quot; <br />
<br />
Connectivity is the single biggest problem. In Hyderabad measures like the elevated corridor, the longest in India from Masab Tank to Aramgarh is designed to tackle this problem. A plan for a dedicated rail service from Begumpet to the new airport is also at the proposal stage. In Bangalore, the approach to the airport will be through National Highway 7 (NH7). From NH7, the airport is at a stretch of five kilometers. A four-lane approach road is being developed by BIAL. This lane is parallel to the runway and will link NH7 to the terminal complex. This road, primarily serving the terminal building, will also link the other airport support facilities. Albert Brunner, CEO of BIAL, &quot;The trumpet interchange which will connect NH7 to this approach road was to be built by the state authorities but has now been taken into BIAL's scope of work. The construction is underway and this will be ready for AOD (Airport Opening Date). A rail link is needed here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jain further talks about an issue which has been often raised in recent times - the need for an independent regulatory authority. He says &quot;At a micro level, there should be an independent regularity authority in place which will have transparent tariffs and governance. An airport by nature is in itself a monopoly. There is no natural competition. When there is an independent authority in place, it creates opportunities for dialogue between the stakeholders. Such an authority is present in other parts of the world and India also needs it soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
Investment stands not only for financial backing but also interest in terms of time and focus. For instance, there are a number of service providers at the airport and it helps if common standards and common usage of systems are followed - like the cargo community system in foreign countries, one amongst many such set-ups, data about cargo is shared between an agent, shipper, airliner and ground handlers and all others involved in the transaction. The whole process is paperless and results in a smooth transaction. In most Indian airports today, things like cargo handling and dispatch take around five to six days. With transparent integrated systems in place, the burgeoning needs on ground can be addressed efficiently<br />
<br />
Another dispute has been regarding the stopover charges levied at the Indian airports which are said to be nearly 25 per cent higher than other international airports, resulting in international airlines avoiding India as stopover points for long-haul flights. The AAI, however, denies these claims. If India is to compete globally, issues like these must be resolved at the earliest. <br />
<br />
The Indian government's plan to spend US$ 20 billion over the next five years upgrading airports has brought some respite. But it is not enough. As per International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates, the amount of investment needed by the Indian aviation industry is around US$ 90 billion over the next 24 years and this provides opportunities for investors worldwide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Initial sales will be for trains, ex-Delhi <br />
<br />
 <br />
By Bhisham Mansukhani | New Delhi <br />
 <br />
 <br />
SriLankan Airlines plans to sell Indian Railways' inventory to India-bound passengers at Colombo Airport, initially for routes out of Delhi and subsequently for most or all of the 11 destinations that the airline flies to in India, with a current total of 99 flights. The airline, which has check-in counters for its flights at railway stations in Belgium, is currently in discussion with Indian Railways for having a precisely opposite arrangement whereby it will offer passengers the facility to book Indian Railways' tickets, according to Dimuthu Tennakoon, Manager - Maharashtra and Gujarat, SriLankan Airlines. He added, &quot;Delhi is the first destination for which this arrangement will be implemented but a similar arrangement for South Indian destinations is also very likely since a lot of our India-bound passengers flying in from Colombo opt for flights to Chennai and Hyderabad and then travel up north by train.&quot; <br />
<br />
While international airlines have interline agreements with most Indian domestic carriers for onward connections and feeder services to and from destinations that the former don't fly to, SriLankan Airlines' arrangement with Indian Railways, when it materialises, will be an undeniable precedent and may open the avenue for similar tie-ups between Indian Railways and other carriers. Industry experts say that an advanced model could also be pursued in future, wherein international carriers could contract massive inventory blocks on designated routes in deals akin to codeshare agreements, thereby combining the flight and train journey under a single Passenger Name Record (PNR). In fact, in June this year, TravelBiz Monitor had reported that International Air Transport Association (IATA) - India was in talks with Indian Railways regarding integration of airline and rail inventory on a single operational platform.</div></div><hr />

                        Amey Amladi, General Manager (Western and Southern Regions), Austrian Airlines, tells Mayuresh Pawar about the airline's future plans for the India market <br />
 <br />
 <br />
  Q. How has Austrian Airlines' experience been in India?<br />
<br />
A. Since commencement of our operations in Mumbai on September 1, 2005, we have had to deal with immense competition from established players. However, in the very first year of operations, we registered a load factor of 67 per cent, and in the following year, the load factor increased to 87 per cent. It was possible only because of the unflinching support of the travel trade in India and the corporate clientele, together with an efficient reservation and sales team.<br />
 <br />
Does the airline have plans to augment its India operations?<br />
<br />
A. Currently, we have daily direct flights from Mumbai and Delhi to Vienna and plans are afoot to start operations on the Chennai-Vienna route by 2008. Besides, we are also planning to add Hyderabad and Bangalore to our route map, but the plan is still in its initial stages.<br />
<br />
What is the airline's USP for Indian travellers?<br />
<br />
A. In terms of USP, we have a midnight departure from Mumbai with an early morning arrival to Vienna and immediate onward connectivity to entire Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe and also convenient connections to New York, Washington, Chicago and Toronto. Our weekend departures are preferred by the corporate segment. Besides Western and Indian cuisine, we also provide Jain meals onboard.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, Austrian has introduced Lie Flat Beds in the Business Class from July 1, this year complementing the Chef on Board, Fine Dining, a wide selection of Austrian wines and our Flying Coffee House with over a dozen varieties of coffee served onboard. This year our airline has been the recipient of several awards including the Best Business Class Catering 2007, Best European Airline of the Year 2007 and the Best Performance European Airlines (Overall Business Traveller) 2007.<br />
<br />
Q. What are the strategies adopted for India?<br />
<br />
A. We have been working closely with the Austrian National Tourist Office (ANTO), and have organised FAM trips for Indian travel agents, journalists and tour operators to Vienna every year. Currently, ANTO is conducting an exclusive programme titled 'Austrian Experts in Mumbai' for the travel fraternity here.<br />
<br />
Q. What is the target clientele?<br />
<br />
A. Ever since we started our Mumbai operations, our focus has been the Meeting, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) segment. Apart from leisure, incentive travel has been at its peak this year and till August we carried over 2,000 passengers to Austria. Salzburg, Graz, Linz, Innsbruck and Swarovski have been the preferred destinations in Austria. Leisure and incentive movements to Central and Eastern Europe have also caught on. At present, Austrian Airlines flies to over 130 destinations, covering 55 countries.<br />

<br />
Press Trust Of India / Mumbai November 19, 2007 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
State-run carrier Air India plans to convert all its Boeing 747-400s into cargo jets in a phased manner and place orders for new, large aircraft to replace them after 2011.  <br />
  <br />
Indicating this, Air India's Chairman V Thulasidas said here that the yet-to-be-ordered large aircraft would either be the double-decker Airbus A-380 or Boeing 747-8.  <br />
  <br />
Air India, which is now expanding its fleet by getting 111 Boeing and Airbus aircraft for domestic and international operations, may consider acquiring at least 60 more aircraft for its expansion beyond 2011.  <br />
  <br />
The present order of 68 Boeing and 43 Airbus aircraft would be completed by 2011, Thulasidas said, adding the fresh order would have to be placed within the next six months to ensure that deliveries start from 2011-2016.  <br />
  <br />
As both Airbus and Boeing are fully booked for the next 3-4 years, �we will have to place orders in 6-months,� he said, adding, �the exercise is on�.  <br />
  <br />
However, no final decision has yet been taken on the number of aircraft nor on purchase of the Airbus A-380. But unlike last time, �we will certainly go in for large aircraft this time,� he said.  <br />
  <br />
�After due diligence and a decision on the types and number of aircraft, the Board will have to approve the decision before we send it to the civil aviation ministry for its approval,� the Air India chief said.  <br />
  <br />
Air India, which had 16 Boeing 747s, is currently operating 12 of them as it has phased out all the Boeing 747-200s. By March, it would phase out two more Boeing 747-300s. Currently, it operates eight Boeing 747-400s, of which it owns six.  <br />
  <br />
On air cargo, Thulasidas said the response has been encouraging and Air India now plans to make Nagpur as its cargo hub for both domestic and international operations.  <br />
  <br />
Air India, which has already converted two of its four Airbus 300s and two of its five Boeing 737-200s into freighters, will start air cargo service from six metros beginning mid-next year.  <br />
  <br />
By then, Air India would have four Airbus 300 and five Boeing 737-200 freighter aircraft, Thulasidas said.  <br />
  <br />
The air cargo will originate from the six metros--Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad, which would converge at Nagpur from where international cargo will also be dispatched using Airbus 300s, he said.  <br />
  <br />
For domestic cargo operations, Boeing 737-200s will be utilised. With the growing demand for cargo, Air India may also look at leasing aircraft for cargo service besides going in for new cargo aircraft, he said.  <br />
  <br />
Boeing manufactures 747, 777 and 767 cargo aircraft while Airbus makes A-330 aircraft, he said, adding that Air India would consider all these aircraft for its cargo service.  <br />
  <br />
Air India is the only air-carrier to start cargo service in India. Among the leading international airlines, Lufthansa, Emirates, Korean Airlines and Singapore Airlines run regular, full-fledged air-cargo services.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobbie501</div><div class="date">November 19th, 2007, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clear rules for flying through fog (http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2007/11/19/stories/2007111950140600.htm)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Armed with the information from the Met office, airport authorities have drawn up an action plan that will hopefully lessen passenger inconvenience during the fog season over the next three months. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2007/11/19/images/2007111950140601.jpg<br />
<br />
There are plans to impart special training to pilots to equip them to land aircraft in various levels of low fog visibility. <br />
<br />
Ashwini Phadnis <br />
<br />
<br />
That fog will disrupt your air travel plans this winter in north India is a given. Details about how bad the situation could get were provided earlier this month by the Meteorological Department when it informed the Ministry of Civil Aviation that there would be disruptions to normal flight operations between December 8 and February 15. <br />
<br />
According to the Met Department, for 150 hours during this three-month period, visibility could drop to below 50 meters, when no flight operations would be possible. <br />
<br />
Armed with the information provided by the Met Department, the authorities have drawn up an action plan that will hopefully lessen passenger inconvenience. <br />
<br />
For starters, during the fog season, airlines would be allowed to start their aircraft engines only after the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) has been informed that all doors of the aircraft have been closed and has also been told whether the crew is Cat III A/B or Cat II qualified. <br />
<br />
Trained staff <br />
<br />
<br />
Cat II and Cat III are various levels of low fog visibility in which a pilot is trained to land aircraft. <br />
<br />
For instance, Cat III B conditions are said to prevail when visibility drops to below 50 meters and no flights can be operated. Airlines are also being asked to ensure that only pilots who are trained and capable of flying in foggy conditions are allowed to operate flights during this period.<br />
<br />
In case false information is provided by the airline about the doors of the aircraft being closed, then the start-up sequence shall be cancelled, which would inevitably lead to some delay in the flight. <br />
<br />
Besides, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has also threatened to take action against those airlines that do not adhere to their schedules by taking away their slots, not only for this year but also the next (a slot is a landing and take-off sequence and is important for an airline to maintain its network and schedule). <br />
<br />
The Air Traffic Controller in Delhi has also been asked to inform airlines operating flights from metro airports such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Hyderabad on an hourly basis about the estimated time of the aircraft reaching Delhi, so that there can be better planning. Besides, the ATC has been asked to accord landing priority at Delhi airport to those flights that have been diverted to other airports close to the national capital as a result of low visibility.<br />
Control cells <br />
<br />
<br />
The Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) has also asked all airlines to nominate senior level officials as nodal officers and post them at the airport during the fog period to take on-the-spot decisions for passenger facilitation and for co-ordinating with the various control cells that have been established by the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), the newly-formed joint venture company running the airport. <br />
<br />
On its part, DIAL will make available 47 bays instead of the present 25 bays for CAT III-compliant aircraft <br />
<br />
Airlines have also been asked to not only augment their ground staff and position them at the airport but also have them fully briefed on how to handle any passenger queries. Airlines have also been advised to inform passengers in advance through SMS or other means of communication of any delay or rescheduling of flights to avoid congestion at the airport. <br />
<br />
Besides, airlines have been asked to periodically update flight information display systems at the airport to inform passengers about any delay or cancellation of flights. <br />
<br />
Airlines have not only been asked to provide hourly updated information of their flights to DIAL but also to make frequent announcements about the status of the flights on the public address system in the check-in and security hold areas. <br />
<br />
Further, to avoid congestion at the airport, it has been suggested that passengers be allowed to go in for security check by the airlines only after ensuring that the flight is ready to depart. <br />
<br />
The DGCA has asked airlines to ensure that if there is a delay in departure after the passengers have boarded the aircraft, beverages such as tea or coffee, water and snacks are provided on board by the airline. <br />
<br />
The Ministry has said that in case an airline fails to provide snacks to the passengers, DIAL should do so and charge the airline for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Houston-based and member of the Sky Team alliance, Continental Airlines recently added its second non-stop service from India to the United States by connecting Mumbai to Newark, New York. Speaking at a press briefing, Jeffrey Smisek, president, Continental Airlines said, &quot;India is fuelling the world economic growth and we are optimistic about the country's economy and position in the aviation world. We are proud to expand our network to India's business capital of Mumbai.&quot;<br />
<br />
The carrier was the first to launch an Indo-US non-stop service when it introduced the Delhi-New York route in 2005. Taking a note from the route's success, Laurent Recoura, senior country director - India, said, &quot;We have about 80 per cent of load factor on that route and are confident that the new service will match up to this figure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smisek further added that with New York being their hub, the carrier would be the first choice for trans-Atlantic travellers. The new service links not only with New York but also - via Continental's unique New York hub at Newark Liberty International Airport - with more than 230 other cities throughout North, Central and South America, the Caribbean and beyond. The flights are being operated by a 285-seat Boeing 777 aircraft, carrying 50 passengers in the Business First cabin and 235 in Economy.<br />
<br />
The service is initially operating four times a week - Monday, Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday at 11:45 p.m. and arriving at New York Liberty at 6.30 a.m. the following day. The return flight departs New York Liberty on Monday and Sunday at 7:20 p.m., arriving at Mumbai at 7:40 p.m. the next day; on Friday and Saturday, the same flight departs New York Liberty at 8:00 p.m., arriving at Mumbai at 8:20 p.m. the following day. Flying times are approximately 16 hours 15 minutes westbound and 14 hours 50 minutes eastbound. Effective October 28, 2007 (westbound), the frequency of the service will increase to daily. <br />
<br />
Jim Summerford, vice president Europe, Middle East &amp; India, Continental Airlines said that the carrier will also add more routes to the country and the neighbouring China as new aircraft are incorporated in its fleet. The carrier has an all-Boeing fleet and has ordered 20 777s and 25 787s (Dreamliner) to be delivered from 2009 onwards. It plans to begin its Shanghai-New York non-stop from early next year. <br />
<br />
Code sharing with Kingfisher Airlines <br />
<br />
In July this year Continental entered into a comprehensive partnership with Kingfisher Airlines for frequent flyer and airport lounge access reciprocity and future codesharing, providing better service to customers who travel between the U.S. and India and transfer between the two carriers. Beginning October 1, 2007, members of the two airlines' frequent flyer programs, Continental's OnePass and Kingfisher's King Club, can earn miles on all flights operated by the other carrier, with redemption capabilities beginning later in the year. Reciprocal airport lounge access for eligible customers, including Continental BusinessFirst and Presidents Club members, also began on October 1. Early next year, the carriers plan to begin codesharing. Continental will place its code (CO) on Kingfisher flights connecting to Continental's daily flights between New York and Delhi and between New York and Mumbai. Customers travelling on connecting flights between Continental and Kingfisher will be able to have single check-in for all flights, including the issuance of electronic tickets, boarding passes and checked baggage to their final destination</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nok Air, the budget airline of Thai Airways International, is cancelling its daily Bangkok-Bangalore route, due mainly to aircraft non-availability and higher jet-oil prices. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This Friday will see the final flight on the route.<br />
<br />
The airline began its Bangalore run amid much fanfare. Although the airline says the route has been very successful, it is nonetheless cancelling it temporarily.<br />
<br />
<br />
CEO Patee Sarasin said in a statement that several considerations had forced the company to reconsider its international operations, resulting in the suspension of this route despite a steadily increasing passenger-load factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those considerations include an unexpected shortage of aircraft, increasing need for additional human resources and constant rises in the cost of jet fuel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patee said Nok Air always conducted extensive research before launching a route, whether international or domestic, in order to make sure it afforded the company a strategic advantage, strengthened its network and matched its revenue-generation plan. &quot;There is absolutely no question Nok Air will continue to develop our network further, both domestically and internationally, to meet our overall business plan,&quot; said Patee.<br />
<br />
<br />
He said to achieve and go beyond company expectations, as well as those of the passengers, Nok Air needed more aircraft and more human resources.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nok Air has added another two leased aeroplanes and is in negotiations for additional aircraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Economic Times reported Nok Air's passenger-load factor had fallen to 40 per cent.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;In India, international low-cost carriers take more time to turn a profit, but they withdraw their operations soon. Also, the return-fare difference - including taxes - between Nok Air and full-service carriers like Thai Airways is about 3,000-4,000 rupees . So Indian passengers prefer a full-service carrier to paying for food and blankets on Nok Air.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
All passengers who have booked seats on the route for after this Friday will be transferred to Thai Airways.<br />
<br />
<br />
[B]Nok Air has not yet launched additional international routes as planned. It is set to fly to Ho Chi Minh City, Macau or Hong Kong, Madras, New Delhi and Hyderabad.<br />
<br />
<br />
The airline will take delivery of four new aeroplanes this year and eight more next year.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another low-cost carrier, Jetstar Asia, withdrew its five flights per week on the Bangalore-Singapore route, citing low passenger numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Several low-cost airlines, such as AirAsia, are considering revising their pricing policy to use one price that includes airfare, fuel surcharge, insurance and other fees, instead of charging all of these separately, like at present.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thai AirAsia CEO Tassapon Bijleveld said this would afford travellers greater convenience when making reservations.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been monitoring the uncertain jet-oil prices,&quot; said Tassapon, adding that nothing had been decided yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thai AirAsia has been offering one-price ticket sales through its website for certain domestic routes on a trial basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
One-Two-Go has also been testing one-price ticket sales with all-inclusive Bt1,850 fares between Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Phuket, Surat Thani, Krabi, Chiang Rai, Hat Yai and Nakhon Si Thammarat. The offer will be effective from December 1.</div></div><hr />

Virgin Plans Domestic airline in India<br />
<br />
<br />
The UK-based Virgin Group is to make an announcement about its telecommunication venture in India within the next two-and-a-half months and would also like to set up a domestic airline, its founder, Sir Richard Branson said on Monday.<br />
<br />
The Group is still nurturing plans of starting a domestic airline, for which an application is pending with the Indian Government. �We would love to fly in the domestic skies. If the market is ever opened to true competition, you would find Virgin flying side-by-side with Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways,� Sir Richard said. <br />
<br />
At the moment, the Indian Government does not allow international airlines to acquire a direct or indirect stake in domestic airlines. To overcome this hurdle, Sir Richard has requested the Government to consider the investment as his personal investment, and not from the airline.<br />
<br />

another article about same news....<br />
<br />
Virgin's Branson says India unwelcoming to investors<br />
<br />
&quot;India is one of the most closely protected countries in the world,&quot; Branson said, adding he spent years trying to persuade different governments to let Virgin fly to Mumbai and New Delhi. It now operates flights to London from India. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I am not allowed to open retail stores in India, if I'm not allowed to open an airline in India, if I'm not allowed to do all these things, then obviously we will take our money elsewhere,&quot; he said. But he was still keen to invest in Asia's third-largest economy, and earlier told reporters he had found an Indian telecoms partner and wanted to enter the domestic airline market. <br />
<br />
India is the world's fastest-growing telecoms market and has received applications from 46 domestic and foreign firms to launch mobile services. &quot;We have a partner now, and I will reveal all in two months' time,&quot; Branson said. Because of the investment cap, foreign firms need a local partner to offer telecom services in India. <br />

atleast 50% FDI should be allowed and gradually increase it to 100%. open skies should be open for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Originally this rule was put in to protect the domestic airlines since a &quot;small&quot; airline like Jet or Sahara can easily be killed by major airlines like BA or Singapore operating domestically.   <br />
<br />
BTW even US has such a rule...it took Virgin 6 years to get to the point of starting a domestic airline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
fledgling airlines could be easy target for M&amp;A by bigger players ... and even a new-entry Kingfisher could eat into well-established lowcost airliner Air Deccan ... had india allowed foreign airliners in 1990s, then we may not have see Jet as it is now, or the Sahara ... <br />
<br />
<br />
but now things changed, so in the interest of air customers, govt can do away with that 5 yr rule so that prices will come down for us :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Lucknow, November 20 The Uttar Pradesh government is lobbying hard for a new international airport at Greater Noida � putting forward among its arguments the increase in passenger load in the National Capital Region in the coming years. <br />
Officials believe even the extended Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi will not be able to bear the brunt of air traffic what with operational delays that dog ongoing aviation projects. The Airport Authority of India (AAI) has already indicated in a recent report that passenger congestion in the NCR is likely to rise by 20 per cent every year. <br />
<br />
The UP government has also prepared a report replete with all facts, figures and future projections on air traffic. <br />
<br />
A government official said, �We have submitted it to the Union government and made a strong case for the international airport.� <br />
<br />
The AAI report says that there will be nearly 1,000 lakh passengers travelling annually through the NCR region by 2017. <br />
<br />
The pressure will mount on Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) floated by GMR, the nodal agency that is building the extension to the IGI airport. <br />
<br />
GMR has estimated a growth of only 8.3 per cent in air traffic in the coming years. On the other hand, the AAI, along with the civil aviation department of Uttar Pradesh, is projecting a Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.4 per cent. <br />
<br />
It has already been 20 per cent in the last five years. <br />
<br />
UP government officials say that GMR�s opposition to TIAH will make the common man suffer. <br />
<br />
The state also believes an airport in Greater Noida will promote the growth of industry. The official said the Centre�s rule that two international airports cannot come up within a radius of 150 kilometers does not hold water because there are instances of this abroad. He said there are five airports in London which has a population of 85 lakh, and some of them are within 150 kms of each other. <br />
<br />
He pointed out UAE, with a population of 50 lakh, has eight airports. <br />
<br />
The Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Centre had earlier given a nod to the UP government to build this hub before niggling concerns like the 150-km radius crept up among other things. <br />
<br />
The airport as well as the Balia-Noida expressway, another feature of the project, would have been executed under the private-public-partnership scheme with the state government not having to spend any money on it. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, global major GMR�s company DIAL, which is working on the expansion of the IGI, plans to complete the first phase by 2010 with an investment of Rs 8,900 crore. UP�s answer to this is the new airport that will come up under the Taj International Aviation Hub project (TIAH).</div></div><hr />

I am not sure where the phrase &quot;kill&quot; comes from...if anything the owners of Jet and Sahara will make a killing on the sale i.e. their shares will have to be bought at a considerable premium (as there will be a bidding war) from the stock market...if the majority of shareholders want a sale, I am not sure why the government would want to prevent it...are they saying that the shareholders are stupid and do not have money to hire to good financial analysts to advise them?<br />
<br />
Restrictions in buying assets by foreigners or locals or whoever is just a joke...a political fear among the mandarins in the corridors of power. As far as a shareholder is concerned, if he or she doesnt like the offer, he or she wouldnt sell the shares...simple as that.<br />

Restrictions in assets is not always bad sometimes used to prevent formation of a monopoly, market forces should be free with checks and balances.<br />
<br />
Airline industry is a volatile industry can anything can happen ... example again US market after 9/11.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Monopolies are decided by antitrust or restrictive practices commission on a case by case basis. You cannot blanket ban any sort of investment from anybody into any commercial venture. Only a fool who frames a policy like that can make another fool believe that this is a wise policy. <br />
<br />
If you want to be in control and make majority decisions on behalf of your company, then you better become a majority stakeholder by purchasing shares through your hard earned money and through your enterprising efforts. <br />
<br />
The slogan should be: get the government out of possibly any business matter as you possibly can. They are the least qualified people to run companies and have no business meddling with purely for-profit, for-greed commercial ventures. It is up to the shareholders of a company to choose to be socially responsible. A government should in no way be allowed to mandate this. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobbie501</div><div class="date">November 22nd, 2007, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aviation: Grounded by manpower shortage (http://sify.com/finance/fullstory.php?id=14565068)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There has has been a phenomenal growth in the civil aviation sector. Three years ago, there were 130 commercial aircraft, and the number has now swelled to 350. The sector is poised to attract an investment of $200 billion. Increased fleet will enable approximately 2,000 commercial flights every day by 2020. This could boost travel and tourism activities in the country.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pilot shortage <br />
<br />
The sector�s primary concern is finding manpower, especially pilots. Currently, the shortage of pilots has led to the recruitment of foreign pilots. Though there are a few pilot-training institutions in the country, they are not able to meet the demand, and many aspiring pilots go abroad for training, which is very expensive.<br />
<br />
Finding technical staff <br />
<br />
One area of concern as far as aviation manpower is concerned is finding technical ground staff. Only a few institutions offer programmes in aeronautical engineering. The Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, awards post-graduate degrees; the Aeronautical Society of India conducts examinations for students enrolled for its distance-learning programme. Though considered equivalent to an aeronautical engineering degree, this programme, which is very useful for working professionals, has not been too successful.<br />
<br />
Aeronautical engineers and technicians <br />
<br />
The existing facilities for training aeronautical engineers are far from adequate and the situation is only likely to worsen in the future. <br />
<br />
It would be better for defence establishments such as the Indian Air Force, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, and the naval and army aviation to recruit aeronautical engineers rather than train engineers with various allied specialisations in aeronautical duties in-house. <br />
<br />
This sector requires technicians and supervisors with different specialisations, such as in aero-engines, air-frames, electronics, instrumentation, electrical and air-conditioning, and so on. Those authorised to declare the fitness of an aircraft prior to a commercial flight have to pass an examination conducted by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Possession of a licence is a mandatory requirement. Many institutions prepare individuals for the DGCA licensing examination, but the quality of training and the high cost are a major area of concern. There is no institution to train technicians and supervisors for activities other than commercial flying such as manufacturing, repair, training, etc.<br />
<br />
Hence planners should be equipped with managerial skills to perform these duties. Many countries have prepared courses on aviation management, and India needs one too, soon.</div></div><hr />

Indians are known for heavy luggage carriers on international flights. Then why do these airports plan so few baggage claim points? Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
The number of processors- be it baggage belt or the number of counter are typically derived from the flight schedule and more importantly the airport peaks. A hell of a lot of calculations go into it and its often quite funny how all those efforts are just to decided whether it has to be 6 or 8.  Projecting a flight schedule to 2020 or 2030 is a tough task though and a lot of factoring goes into it from politics to changes that may happen to the aviation industry. It�s typically easy for airports that are the base for major airlines like Emirates for Dubai, Etihad for Abu Dhabi or Qatar Airways for Qatar. But it surely must be a tough task for Indian airports where the players are not really very clear. Besides you need a lot of data to be provided to the designers by the airport authorities and that�s where my concern has always been. Are the new generations of airports being designed to some projected values or are we simply getting pretty structures in glass and steel from foreign consultants.<br />
<br />
I guess you�ll agree with me when I say most of the plans that we see are so rigid that expansion like adding another baggage belt or another bank of 30 check-in counters are simply impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
NEW DELHI: The government has proposed to set up an independent Regulatory Authority - Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) - with an aim to create a level playing field and healthy competition amongst all major airports, Rajya Sabha was told on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
This was stated by the Minister of State for Civil Aviation Praful Patel in a written reply. <br />
<br />
For this, AERA Bill 2007 has since been introduced in Lok Sabha on September 5 this year. <br />
<br />
Tourists: In order to attract foreign tourists, National Aviation Company of India Limited has launched special holiday packages known as AirIndia Flyaways. These packages are saleable in domestic as well as international markets, he said. <br />
<br />
A-380: It is planned the new Hyderabad international airport at Shamshabad will be A-380 compatible. While there are plans to upgrade Chennai and Kolkata airports, Delhi and Mumbai airports are being upgraded by joint venture companies for A-380 compatibility, Patel said. <br />
<br />
Foreigners: Security clearance of foreign crew and engineers is necessary before they can be allowed to operate and maintain Indian registered aircraft. Further director and chairman or CEO of the organisation seeking no objection certificate are also required to be security cleared, he said. <br />
<br />
Levy: International flights are levied 33 per cent more than domestic flights for landing and terminal navigation landing charges (TNLC) at international airports. At domestic airports also landing and TNLC are higher for international flights, he said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Flemingo Duty Free � Dubai�s only privately-owned duty free company - in many ways is an underestimated group, and one that was not taken seriously by many suppliers, even after it had broken into the Indian duty free monopoly with its first stores in Indian airports in 2003.<br />
<br />
New operations will open at Kolkata International Airport by November and together with the company�s other recent new contract, Calicut (Kozhikode) in Kerala, this adds to the list of airports where Flemingo is the exclusive operator, the others being Chennai, Calcutta and Trivandrum airports.<br />
<br />
With this five-year concession for Kolkata (Calcutta), Flemingo now operates in 14 airports in India and it has the largest share of the US$150 million duty free market. Flemingo is also operating in four of the top five airports in India.<br />
<br />
Some 167square metres of space will be available in Kolkata, where duty free was historically run by the India Tourism Development Corporation. Flemingo is installing all the core categories there, such as liquor, tobacco, perfume and confectionery. In addition, jewellery, consumer technology and gift items will also be available. <br />
<br />
Seaport shops also add to the company�s critical mass in India, and the last one added to the list was Paradeep Port, joining maritime shops in Chennai, Goa, Mumbai, Vizag, Kendala and other ports.<br />
<br />
The reports said that following an examination by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board such outlets may be permitted, subject to permission from the Department of Commerce. In addition to the Special Economic Zones of Chennai, Salt Lake, Mangalore, Navi Mumbai, Kandla, Nanguneri, Visakhapatnam, Indore, Paradeep and Jodhpur, Flemingo has sought permission to open duty free land border outlets at the Wagah border with Pakistan, besides an additional outlet at Mumbai International Airport.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.ndtvprofit.com/homepage%5Cmonitor.asp?id=5338<br />
<br />
Kingfisher Airlines today announced that it will be launching services on seven new sectors and that it will add five new cities to the network of destinations served by it. A total of sixteen new flights will be added to the daily departures of Kingfisher Airlines. <br />
<br />
The newly introduced services include flights on virgin routes which were not being served by any airline so far. The virgin routes launched by Kingfisher Airlines are Aurangabad- Udaipur, Jodhpur-Jaisalmer and Agra-Jaipur. The other new services launched by Kingfisher Airlines include a service from Jaipur to Udaipur, Udaipur to Jodhpur, Jodhpur to Jaisalmer, Agra to Jaipur, Jaipur to Jodhpur, Jaipur to Agra, Agra to New Delhi and New Delhi to Jaipur. <br />
<br />
The five new cities that Kingfisher Airlines will add to its route network are Aurangabad, Agra, Udaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer. These flights will be operated using brand new ATR72-500 aircraft with Kingfisher Class featuring personalized in-flight entertainment on every seat, gourmet cuisine and world class service. With the launch of these new services, Kingfisher Airlines will have 238 departures a day and will serve 42 destinations with a fleet of 37 brand new aircraft. <br />
<br />
Commenting on the launch of yet another series of new sectors, Mr. V. Raja, Global Sales Head, Kingfisher Airlines Limited said, &#8220;Our flights on the Udaipur-Aurangabad route will ensure that the affluent segment of tourists from Rajasthan will now be able to travel to Aurangabad and visit places of historic importance there too. There is huge potential to tap the pilgrimage market especially for pilgrims visiting the Srinath Temple and Salasar and the Aurangabad-Udaipur flights which will link Rajasthan with Maharashtra will cater to this segment. Besides this market, services on this sector will also cater to the burgeoning community of traders and high net worth individuals who have been instrumental in bolstering trade and commerce in these regions especially since the Aurangabad flight will cater to outlying markets like Jalna, Jalgaon and Nanded in the Marathwada region&#8221;. <br />
<br />
Sharing the motivation behind the launch of the flights to Udaipur, Jodhpur Jaisalmer, Agra and Jaipur, Mr. Raja added, &#8220;The new flights to be introduced by Kingfisher Airlines in this region are targeted squarely at discerning travelers on the popular tourist circuits and will also cater to traffic in important centres of trade and commerce. The Agra-Jaipur service is a virgin route hitherto un-served by air connectivity. Likewise, the flights that will operate on the Jodhpur-Jaipur sector will make Kingfisher Airlines the only airline to offer daily services on this route. Our New Delhi-Agra flight will offer very convenient same day return timings for New Delhi based guests. We will also add one more flight on the New Delhi-Jaipur route which means Kingfisher Airlines will have a double-daily flight on this route.&#8221;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Euromast</div><div class="date">November 28th, 2007, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">//NEW DELHI: With Airports Authority of India planning to hike its expenditure on modernising airports by a whopping 250 per cent in the 11th Plan, a parliamentary committee has asked it to ensure that there is no cost and time overrun in implementation of the projects. <br />
<br />
The AAI has informed the Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU) that it proposed to spend over Rs 12,417 crore in the 11th Plan compared with Rs 3,535 crore in the 10th Plan, an increase of almost 250 per cent. <br />
<br />
Noting that AAI had set up a project management cell to assess the progress of its projects, the COPU, headed by CPI(M) leader Rupchand Pal, recommended that this cell should &quot;periodically assess the work of the ongoing projects so as to ensure that there is no cost and time overrun&quot; in their implementation. <br />
<br />
Regretting that AAI had taken &quot;more than a decade&quot; to prepare and finalise its corporate plan, it said the profit- making public sector unit had to &quot;resort to segmented approach to the issues arising from time to time rather than having a holistic approach.&quot; <br />
<br />
Observing that only 12 out of 90 operational airports were profit-making, the COPU emphasised that adequate steps be taken to augment the share of non-traffic revenue of airports to strengthen the existing infrastructure.</div></div><hr />

Will deploy B787 and introduce first class seats on Mumbai-Tokyo route<br />
<br />
<br />
Tokyo-based All Nippon Airways (ANA) is currently evaluating the route viability to start daily operations from either Chennai or Kolkata. The airline already has the traffic rights to start daily operations from one more city in India and is likely to commence operations by 2009-10. ANA will deploy the B737 currently operated on Mumbai-Tokyo route with a configuration of all Business class seats (36) for flights to Chennai or Kolkata. The airline will deploy B787 Dreamliner on the Mumbai-Tokyo route. The airline operates six flights a week on the route. <br />
<br />
&quot;Once B787 is inducted on the Mumbai route, the airline will introduce two class configurations - First and Business class,&quot; says Kenji Sugino, Director, Administration, Marketing and Sales, ANA. The airline will have a configuration of eight First class seats and 80 Business class seats for the Mumbai route. Currently the airline registers a load factor of 70 per cent with around 80 per cent of the traffic coming in from Mumbai, Pune and Goa with the rest from Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi. Business traffic between India and Japan is increasing by 10 per cent on a yearly basis and the airline is looking at increasing traffic on the Mumbai-Tokyo route by 40 per cent by 2009-10. &quot;In future, we are also intending to launch our website, although we don't know when this development will materialise,&quot; informed Sugino.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Singapore Airlines plans to add nine more weekly flights to India by the end of 2008. Talks in this regard are under way between the governments of Singapore and India. <br />
<br />
While Singapore Airlines currently operates 55 flights a week to India, its sister airline, Silk Air, operates another 15 flights a week. The two airlines together operate 70 flights a week to 11 destinations in India.<br />
<br />
Addressing a news conference here today, Mr Subhas Menon, Singapore Airlines� Regional Vice-President (West Asia &amp; Africa), said the airline wanted to augment services to and from cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. <br />
<br />
He said the average passenger load factor on the Singapore-India-Singapore sector was around 80 per cent. As such, it was necessary to not only augment the number of flights to India but also consider the option of operating bigger aircraft to destinations such as Mumbai, which currently has two flights daily to and from Singapore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A booming economy, and the profits thereof, is letting a host of entrepreneurs take their goals sky-high, literally. An increasing number of businessmen are entering the aviation business. <br />
<br />
Sample this. Kochi-based Emric Aviation is a proposed regional carrier promoted by Martin Sebastian, a Kerala-based real estate and infrastructure developer who has diversified into the hospitality and SEZ development businesses, and digital film production. Says chief executive Muhaimin Saidu, �All one needs to start a regional carrier is good entrepreneurial skills and capital investment. While I have worked as an aircraft engineer, we are a team of people from different backgrounds.� <br />
<br />
The company is targeting cities like Madurai, Trichy, Coimbatore and Mysore, and is in negotiations with Bombardier and Embraer for its aircraft fleet. �Cochin had 25% passenger growth year on year and this will be the first Cochin-based airline. We are targeting cities such as Madurai, Trichy and Mysore, which are commercial hubs.� <br />
<br />
According to industry estimates, the domestic passenger traffic in India recorded a 45% growth during April-September 2006, over the previous year. It�s also estimated that almost 2,000 passenger aircraft will be required in 10 years time. According to Kapil Kaul, CEO, Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) in New Delhi, �The Indian aviation market has been heavily dependant on Tier-I players so far. However, to grow the business, regional players need to be allowed to come up in a big way.� <br />
<br />
Emric Air is joined by others like travel firms Air Dravida in Chennai and the Bird Group in Delhi, Indus Air by breweries company Mohan Meakin in the North, Gurgaon-based MDLR Airlines, Star Aviation and Trans India Aviation, who are all set to enter this emerging segment. <br />
<br />
So what makes this such an attractive proposition? The opportunity that�s opening up in regional routes, connecting the Tier-II cities, is fuelled by a variety of factors. �Regional services have a lot of potential in South India as the economy of South Indian cities is booming,� says Air Dravida�s CEO, Ramachandran Iyer. <br />
<br />
The airline is part of Premier Tours and Travel, a ticketing and travel agency company in Chennai, and plans an initial investment of Rs 40 crore in the new business. Air Dravida is eyeing passengers who fly international routes from smaller towns via the metros � say from Trichy or Coimbatore to Chennai onwards to Singapore. <br />
<br />
Up North, for the Bird Group � with a background in the travel and hospitality businesses � launching an airline is a natural step forward. The group, which has a joint venture with Amadeus, a GDS player for air ticket reservation and Thai-based Dusit Thani Group of Hotels, does ground handling, airport check-ins and also runs a training academy for the travel industry. <br />
<br />
Says executive director Ankur Bhatia, of the yet unnamed airline, �We already have a licence to operate as a non-scheduled operator. We should be able to get that converted into a regional airline licence hopefully by mid next year.� <br />
<br />
The company is looking at 30- and 70-seater Turbo Prop aircraft for operating in the north Indian market. <br />
While the opportunity is big, regional carriers will have to contend with the challenges of funding, airport infrastructure and talent. <br />
<br />
According to the DGCA�s policy on regional carriers, the paid capital for a carrier with three aircraft should be at least Rs 12 crore, which could be increased to a maximum of Rs 20 crore as the airline expands its fleet. However, CAPA�s Kaul says this wouldn�t be enough for a regional carrier to survive the eventual battle for the skies. �I believe airlines which can invest Rs 150-200 crore, are the ones which will survive. Also the economies of scales will work only if an airline has at least 15 aircraft,� he explains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HI Sun,<br />
<br />
Two reasons for this - not enough load factor to justify daily flights. Besides, the aircraft they use for the HKG-BOM-HKG sector is a wet-lease airbus from Czech Airways (about which I posted a long post 4 months back). Which means, they do not have enough aircrafts to spare for their East Asian network.    It is true that AI has ordered 60+ brand new aircrafts but deliveries are going to be a trickle till say, perhaps, 2010 - 2012.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, looking at AI's policy of putting wet-lease a/c or OLD a/c on East Asian networks suggests that they do not put much onus on serving their E.A passengers to a prime service.   Reading of AI's forays on western hemisphere services, the Eastern hemisphere services pale in comparison.<br />
<br />
Anyways, hoping for the better :)<br />
<br />

Jet to suspend flights from Ahmedabad to London<br />
<br />
http://www.livemint.com/2007/11/29234459/Jet-to-suspend-flights-from-Ah.html<br />
<br />
Facing poor passenger response, Jet Airways is planning to suspend international flights to London�s Heathrow airport from Ahmedabad after mid-January. <br />
<br />
Jet is operating three flights a week from Ahmedabad. The airlines opened this route in March, targeting the Gujarati and non-resident Indian community staying in the UK.<br />
<br />
�We will withdraw Ahmedabad-London flights from 15 January and will deploy this capacity into Amritsar-London route,� said Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, chief executive officer of Jet. �The passenger load factor of Amritsar is comparatively better than Ahmedabad,� he added. Prock-Schauer said the airline will route passengers for the UK from Ahmedabad through Mumbai as it is the closest airport for them.<br />
<br />
However, state-run carrier Air India will continue its daily flights from Ahmedabad to London, according to an official, who didn�t want to be named, claiming �the carrier is having very good passenger load factor.�</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vijay Mallya, the new leader in domestic skies, will fly international routes under Kingfisher and Deccan brands from the next calendar year. <br />
<br />
Putting to rest speculation whether he will be able operate Kingfisher brand internationally, UB Group chairman Mallya said: �There has been confusion around this, and I would like to clarify that Deccan Aviation will also do businesses as Kingfisher Airlines by 2008. The government rules says the operator or the company has to complete five years, but it does not talk about logo, or aircraft livery or brand.� <br />
<br />
In fact, Kingfisher is finalising parking bays and time slots for itself at New York and San Francisco airports. The airline is also booking space for operating exclusive lounges in these international hubs.<br />
<br />
It is believed that UB will operate its long haul international flights to the US and UK under Kingfisher while low-cost destinations to the Middle East and South Asian markets are likely to be covered by Deccan. In fact, Kingfisher Airlines is in the process of firming up plans for launching non-stop flights to San Francisco, New York and London from Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi early next year. The airline also plans to connect Los Angeles and Canada as well. <br />
<br />
Kingfisher Airlines is expected to see the arrival of the five A340 aircraft between March to August next year to kick-off international operations. The airline has also placed orders for five A330s and five A350s to support its overseas plans. Till date it is the first domestic carrier to place orders for five A380 aircraft. <br />
<br />
Mr Mallya said Kingfisher-Deccan combine was reworking its capacity build up plans, as the domestic aviation sector was beefing up capacities ahead of industry growth figures. �We would rather focus on filling up existing capacities with higher yields,� he added.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Qatar Airways wants to connect to more Indian cities and to increase the number of flights out of India. <br />
<br />
For this, the Government of Qatar is in talks with the Government of India, Qatar Airways� Chief Executive Officer, Mr Akbar Al Baker, told a press conference here on Thursday. <br />
<br />
For the 13-year-old Qatar Airways, India (along with China) is a big market. It already connects to seven Indian cities and will launch its Ahmedabad-Doha operations on December 12. <br />
<br />
Being from a small country, Qatar Airways (which is half-owned by the State) intends to position itself as an international carrier, like Singapore Airlines. <br />
<br />
Today, it connects Doha to 80 cities across the world and plans to fly into more destinations. <br />
<br />
Keen on India <br />
<br />
India is seen as a big provider of passengers. <br />
<br />
Apart from the metros, Qatar Airways operates two flights a week out of Nagpur. Officials of the airline say that a large chunk of central India is a good catchment area. <br />
<br />
Qatar Airways is also interested in introducing flights out of, among other cities, Amritsar and Bangalore. <br />
<br />
�It will be my delight to have further bilateral talks with Indian authorities for additional frequencies and additional destinations,� Mr Al Baker said. <br />
<br />
Nagpur repair centre <br />
<br />
<br />
Asked if Qatar Airways (which would have a large fleet of Boeings in a few years) would use Boeing�s upcoming maintenance, repair overhaul (MRO) centre at Nagpur, despite the fact that the airline is building a huge service centre for its aircraft in Doha, Mr Al Baker replied in the affirmative. <br />
<br />
�We are very happy that Boeing is putting up its MRO at Nagpur. These facilities will be by Qatar Airways. Yes, we are building a huge aircraft maintenance facility at the upcoming Doha international airport, which will have the capacity to handle 13 aircraft at a time. <br />
<br />
Still, with over 120 airplanes in its fleet, we will always have the opportunity to use the facilities that are being built in Nagpur,� he said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Airports Authority of India (AAI) will establish Mobile Command Post (MCP), a hightech safety service at its 66 big airports to combat and co-ordinate all kind of aviation emergencies, with an investment of around Rs 100 crore. <br />
<br />
MCP will be ultra-modern heavy duty trucks that will be mounted with satellite-enabled and wirelessbased communication systems to control post-mishaps situations in coordination with civil authorities. It will serve as the single point of disaster management at these airports. <br />
<br />
It is part of AAI�s safety upgradation programme to meet the higher safety standards at all international and major domestic airports, which have seen massive jump in air-traffic in recent years. <br />
<br />
Each of the truck will have a GPSbased satellite navigation, satellite phones and wireless sets, faxes, TV cameras and monitors to aid safety measures. Initially, MCP will be installed at the key airports�Kolkata , Amritsar, Trivandrum and Chennaiand will later be standardised at all the 66 airports, all of which are equipped with AAI�s fire safety services. <br />
<br />
�With the rise in the number of fire incidents in the aviation sector and rapid expansion of air-services , we have decided to standardise fire services at all our airports. As the skies are increasingly getting congested , we have laid out elaborate plans to upgrade our aeronautical safety services and over Rs 500 crore have been earmarked in the next five years. These equipment most of which will be imported will also help us to meet global safety parameters laid out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation,� said a senior official of AAI. <br />
<br />
The new service is likely to be incorporated at the airports by mid-2008 and AAI is in the process of finalising tenders quotations for MCP. These equipment are also expected to come up at the Delhi and Mumbai airports, which are being modernised by private consortiums, where AAI is also a major stake holder.</div></div><hr />

Friday, 30 November , 2007, 15:54<br />
   <br />
New Delhi: As Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines readies to fly to the US from August 2008, it has decided on Terminal Four of the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to cater to growing business from the nation's east coast. <br />
<br />
The decision follows Kingfisher chairman Vijay Mallya's visit to New York last week when he inspected two contenders for his flights -- the JFK International Airport and the Newark Airport in adjacent New Jersey, officials said. <br />
<br />
Global consultancy Accenture is presently working on the merger of Air Deccan with Kingfisher and also looking into route rationalisation of international sectors for both airlines, an official explained. <br />
<br />
When completed, it will permit Mallya's airline to fly abroad by fulfilling the government requirement of a carrier having flown for at least five years in the domestic sector, with a minimum fleet size of 20 aircraft. <br />
<br />
Air Deccan received its Air Operators Permit in January 2003 and the government has already given the carrier an in-principle nod to fly overseas, the official added. <br />
<br />
The airline has sought permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for 40 routes that include the US, Middle East and South East Asia. <br />
<br />
Kingfisher Airlines is also in the process of firming up plans to launch non-stop flights to San Francisco, New York and London from Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. The airline also plans to connect Los Angeles and Vancouver. <br />
<br />
It is also hoping to start flights to the Middle East from March 2008. <br />
<br />
The North American sector is getting crowded as Jet Airways recently launched a daily flight from New Delhi to JFK via its hub in Brussels. <br />
<br />
The airline already operates daily flights on the Mumbai-Brussels-Newark and the Chennai-Brussels-Toronto sectors. <br />
<br />
Kingfisher will get delivery of five wide-bodied A340s between March and August next year and use them for its non-stop long-haul international operations. It has also ordered five A330s and five A350s. It is the first domestic carrier to order five A380s. <br />
It is not clear on what routes Kingfisher will deploy the A380s as deliveries only start in 2011-12, but they may be used on India-US sector given the demand, officials said. <br />
<br />
Following its investment in Air Deccan, the Kingfisher-Deccan combine is India's largest domestic airline group that connects 75 cities offering over 558 flights daily with a fleet of 80 aircraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
HYDERABAD: Air India is planning to place a bigger order than the recent one for the purchase of aircraft after 2011 as part of expanding the modern fleet, even as it is aimed to �convert India into a global hub.�<br />
<br />
Talking to reporters on the sidelines of �INFOCOM-2007� conference and exhibition, V. Thulasidas, Chairman and Managing Director, said the last aircraft of the latest purchase order would be received by the end of 2011. <br />
<br />
The plans for aircraft required later would be firmed up and placed now. Air India was working on a much larger plan than what had been undertaken so far.<br />
<br />
He said that four maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) joint ventures were also proposed to be established � one each with Boeing and Airbus and two others for engines and components. The integration process at the top management level was completed and it was expected to be concluded for all other areas by next year-end.<br />
<br />
Phenomenal growth <br />
<br />
<br />
Earlier, delivering the keynote address at a panel discussion on �Challenges in aviation industry by 2020�, he said the aviation industry in the country had recorded a phenomenal growth in the last few years. <br />
<br />
It was around 36 per cent in the current fiscal. The average growth rate over the last two and a half years was 33 per cent for domestic and 17 per cent for international travel.<br />
<br />
There were 325 aircraft which would be less than the fleet of one large airline in the U.S. Pointing out that another 400 aircraft would be arriving in the next few years, he said that while the Indian aviation industry had taken off on a very significant growth trajectory, a lot of catching up needed to be done. <br />
<br />
Observing that high cost and wafer thin margins characterised airline business, he said airlines� debt globally had become three per cent of their equity. During the last six years, airlines the world over had suffered losses of $42 billion. <br />
<br />
However, the International Air Transport Association had forecast that the business would turn the corner and make a profit of a little over $5 billion this year.<br />
<br />
Improving efficiency <br />

<br />
Stating that the country�s airlines business had suffered significant losses, he called for driving down the operating costs by improving efficiency.<br />
<br />
Sridhar Phadke, executive director, IT, Air India, said the organisation was studying the possibility of introducing biometric solutions for security at airports and also planning to implement RFID (radio frequency identification) technology for tracking passengers.</div></div><hr />

AI may join global Star Alliance, hints Swiss International Airlines (http://www.indianexpress.com/story/243836.html)<br />
<br />
Air India�s bid to join Star Alliance, the global alliance of international airlines, seems to be gathering strength. Swiss International Airlines CEO Christoph Franz, in the Capital to flag off daily flights between Delhi and Zurich, re-affirmed his company�s close ties with Air India and the need for a �strong Indian partner� in the global alliance.<br />
<br />
 �We have always had a code share agreement with Air India in Delhi and Mumbai and it is a long going relationship. We are looking for a strong Indian partner because it is a very important and attractive market and it will help close a white spot in the alliance�, he said.<br />
<br />
On Jet Airways, which is also competing for a place in the alliance, Franz said that they had a good relationship with the airline but the decision would be taken by all the members of the alliance. �The decision on getting an Indian partner in Star Alliance should be taken in a couple of months,� he added. Being part of Star Alliance would be no mean feat for an Indian carrier and would give it a global identity, expanding customer access to a far larger network besides helping the carrier re-align international routes to access new markets.<br />
<br />
Franz also underlined the significance of the Indian market in the current scenario, pointing out that Delhi is the first new intercontinental destination in their expanding network. Swiss Airlines had pulled out of Delhi in 2003 in the aftermath of 9/11, which had affected the finances of several airlines.<br />
<br />
�India is an important destination for us not only for trade but also tourism. There was a 67 per cent increase in trade volumes between Switzerland and India between 2004 and 2006. The Indian market is very dynamic and developing at a very high speed. We are also glad that the Indian government is seriously looking at infrastructure upgradation at airports,� added Franz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jet Airways may expand its wings in Europe. The government has permitted the airline to fly to Barcelona, Paris, Manchester and Vienna under a code-share agreement with Brussels Airlines.<br />
<br />
�We have granted permission to Jet Airways to code-share with Brussels Airlines on various routes such as Barcelona and Manchester with immediate effect. Their request to code-share with American Airlines is, currently, being looked at,� an official in the ministry of civil aviation told ET. According to experts, the move would usher in tough competition between public sector Air India and Jet Airways in the sector.<br />
<br />
With Air India joining Star Alliance next month for getting wider global connectivity, the war between the national carrier and Jet Airways is likely to hot up in Europe.<br />
<br />
Jet Airways had recently been designated traffic rights for Birmingham, Madrid and Geneva. While Air India operates to Birmingham and Paris, other routes are still untapped. The public sector carrier flies on these routes on its own, unlike Jet Airways which operates on code-share basis.<br />
<br />
�As we would be inducted into Star Alliance next month, we would be serving almost all the points across the world, particularly Europe. But in the meantime we are planning to connect Vienna shortly,� an Air India official said.<br />
<br />
 In a move to strengthen its international operation, Jet Airways has set up its hub in Brussels. The company is operating flights to New York, Toronto and London via its European hub.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We are close to finalising our European hub from where Air India is planning to start additional services to Europe and the US,&quot; a senior Air India official said. <br />

With London, Paris and Frankfurt already over-crowded, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Air India to get more slots for expanding its operations. <br />

&quot;We are, therefore, looking at other airports where we can get slots easily,&quot; the official said. <br />

The hub selection is based on connectivity, incentives and costs, he said, adding that after considering all these factors, Air India started its serious evaluation of both Munich and Vienna. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cbeboy</div><div class="date">December 2nd, 2007, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">India is moving up another global listing � of being among the top 10 revenue generating routes for several global airlines. <br />
<br />
Whether it is neighbouring Singapore or Sri Lanka, or the faraway US or Britain, flying to India makes good business sense. <br />
<br />
Mr Subhas Menon, Regional Vice-President, West Asia and Africa, Singapore Airlines, told Business Line that �it would seem that India marches to a different drum beat from the rest of the world. India, it would appear, remains largely insulated from happenings in different parts of the globe.�<br />
<br />
For Singapore Airlines, India has been registering double-digit growth in capacity even when the rest of its global route network is growing in single digits. �For us, India is definitely among the top 10 revenue generators globally and features very strongly among our scheme of things,� Mr Menon said.<br />
<br />
Among top three <br />
<br />
<br />
According to Mr Robert James Baird, Area General Manager, Asia and the Pacific, British Airways, the latest results show that the India route is among the top three revenue generators for the airline. <br />
<br />
Airline officials added that the latest revenue figures show that India has overtaken Australia.<br />
<br />
Adds Ms Nisha Maharaj, Regional Manager, American Airlines, �The launch of any new sector has to make good business sense. We are seeing growth on a year-to-year basis on the India route.� <br />
<br />
Sensing the business potential early on, the airline first launched flights to India before starting operations to China and Russia. <br />
<br />
According to the Mr Peter Hill, Chief Executive Officer, Srilankan Airlines, while India was not among the top revenue generator for the airline earlier, the situation is different now. <br />
<br />
During financial year 2006-07, India accounted for 32 per cent of the airline�s global traffic with SriLankan carrying 1.1 million passengers to and from India. <br />
<br />
�We are keen to reach 150 weekly flights to India in the next five years,� Mr Hill added. The airline currently operates 100 weekly flights to India. <br />

<br />
<br />
Low-cost airline Deccan is planning to fly to destinations in South East Asia and the Middle East after completion of five years of domestic operations in August 2008. <br />
<br />
Deccan Aviation Chief Operating Officer Preetham Philip told visiting reporters that the airline would commence flying overseas from August next year. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are presently working on this and studying the bilaterals,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
When asked which countries would the airline prefer to fly, he said these were in South East Asia and the Middle East. <br />
<br />
He said Deccan would get delivery of four A320s before August next year and these would be used for short-haul destinations overseas. <br />
<br />
Philip said the airline would approach the Centre before March 2008 to seek approval for overseas operations and is looking at secondary airports in those countries to contain costs. <br />
<br />
The airline would, however, continue to focus on domestic operations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.livemint.com/2007/12/03003047/Star-Aviation-licensed-to-be-I.html<br />
<br />
India's first scheduled regional airline will soon take to the skies with the civil aviation ministry issuing an operating licence to Chennai-based Star Aviation Pvt. Ltd, an airline start-up unit of the ETA Star group, a Dubai-headquartered conglomerate.<br />
<br />
The entry of so-called regional airlines, which are permitted only to fly between India�s large and small cities or between small cities under government rules, is expected to halt rising fares in an industry under consolidation. Regional airline companies are not allowed to fly crowded routes between large metropolitan cities.<br />
<br />
Star Aviation has been given permission to start a regional service in the South, according to civil aviation minister Praful Patel. This is the first scheduled airline licence issued by the ministry in more than a year.<br />
ETA Star has business interests in engineering, construction, shipping, automobiles, manufacturing, retail, travel and energy, according to its website. Earlier this month, it ordered a mid-sized business jet from Hawker Beechcraft Corp. for operations in West Asia. The group had revenues of $4 billion (nearly Rs16,000 crore) in 2006, said the website.<br />
<br />
A Bangalore-based spokesman for the group declined immediate comment.</div></div><hr />

NEW DELHI: Delhi-based Jaypee group may partner US-based Houston Airport System (HAS) in its bid to build the proposed airport at Zevar, Greater Noida. <br />
<br />
Jaypee Associates executive chairman Manoj Gaur told ET the company was interested in entering airport construction space but didn�t give details. <br />

Houston Airport System operates three facilities in Houston: George Bush Intercontinental Airport, William P Hobby Airport, and Ellington Field. The three-airport system served over 51 million passengers in 2006, according to HAS website. <br />

The likelihood, however, of Greater Noida airport as proposed by the UP government is still uncertain as the Centre is still debating its pros and cons. The matter is before the Union Cabinet. <br />

Jaypee group�s plans are not limited to the proposed Greater Noida airport. It plans to bid for airports in other metro and smaller cities as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
�SpiceJet is working on a model to introduce lower fuel surcharge on-flights which are of less than 90 minutes. We are also contemplating a lower surcharge model on a 60-minute flight. <br />
<br />
This will help us in attracting passengers who currently travel by Volvo buses and trains on shorter routes such as Bangalore to Chennai,� SpiceJet CFO Partha Sarathi Basu said. <br />
<br />
GoAir MD Jeh Wadia agrees: �You will soon hear some announcements on this from our side. We are evaluating differential pricing of surcharges for shorter and longer routes.� <br />
<br />
Simplifly Deccan is also planning to attract more travellers into its fold. �As a commercial organisation, we always look at ways to enhance customer acceptability. One such option that we are considering is application of a differing fuel surcharge on different routes. This will primarily be on the basis of the length of the sector,� says Simplifly Deccan CEO Ramki Sundaram. <br />
<br />
Airlines will, however, need to make changes in their IT systems for implementing the same. �There are matters regarding implementation that we will have to consider especially on the ability of IT to support such changes,� Mr Sundaram adds. <br />
<br />
But Ankur Bhatia, MD of Amadeus, a global airline distribution system, does not think it would be difficult. �Technology-wise its should not be difficult to implement for airlines or for GDS players. Systems are quite capable of handling it,� he said. <br />
<br />
Currently, a passenger travelling from Delhi to Jaipur is being made to pay the same fuel surcharge (Rs 1,650) and congestion surcharge (Rs 150) as a passenger travelling from Delhi to Bangalore. While a Delhi-Jaipur flight is of 60 minute duration, a Delhi-Bangalore flight is of two hours 30 minutes duration. Both consume different amount of fuel so ideally different surcharges should be levied. But that�s not the way fare surcharges were structured. Globally, fuel surcharge is levied as a percentage of basic fare. <br />
<br />
But in India it�s levied as a flat sum, across sectors. �Fuel surcharge did not exist two to three years ago. It�s a marketing gimmick as airlines don�t want to show an upside in basic fare and thus club it under surcharges,� Mr Bhatia adds. <br />
<br />
Some from the industry also think so. �Logically and ideally from the consumers point of view, it should be differentiated,� SpiceJet V-P (marketing and planning) Kamal Hingorani told ET. <br />
<br />
Owing to higher fuel prices, airlines increased fuel surcharge, earlier this month, from Rs 1,350 to Rs 1,650. This hike has prompted airlines to introduce differential fuel surcharge lest they lose short haul passengers. Currently, only low-cost carriers are planning a differential pricing structure. However, full service carriers may soon follow suit as LCCs take the lead.</div></div><hr />

I think all Indian cities should put aside 20-40 square miles of land outside their cities for future airport construction.  Whatever is being built now will be woefully inadequate as soon as it comes online.  IMO, the only solution is new modern green field airports.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's nothing wrong with private companies operating airports.  There should, however, be some set of guidelines or regulations they would need to follow and for national security reasons the government should be able to take control in times of war, etc.<br />
<br />
I would imagine any private company would indeed be able to provide customer service that is a &quot;zillion&quot; times better than anything AAI can offer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
S. Anil Radhakrishnan <br />
<br />
Thiruvananthapuram: Air India (AI) is considering extension of the prestigious non-stop daily flight from Mumbai to JFK airport in New York to south to ensure adequate load in the economy class. <br />
<br />
The proposal has been mooted as the 195 seats in the maiden 777-200 LR (Long Range) aircraft deployed by the national carrier for the flight in the Mumbai-New York sector is going almost empty.<br />
<br />
Airline sources said the move was to link the non-stop flight with one of the airports in the southern States to ensure adequate load. Bangalore along with Kochi is being actively considered by the airline as it will ensure direct connectivity to New York. <br />
<br />
The proposal has been mooted as the response from the travellers to the gesture shown by the national carrier to reduce the two-way economy fare from the domestic points for the flight had not been encouraging. The two-way economy fare in the Mumbai-New York sector was reduced from Rs.80,000 to Rs.34,000. <br />
<br />
Airline sources said the fares had again been reduced to Rs.32,900 from the first week of December. Of course, the traveller will have to pay a tax of Rs.15,770 in addition to the fare. Airline sources said the demand for the non-stop flight was picking up. <br />
<br />
As part of marketing the flight to New York, the airline is already offering through baggage check-in facility and international boarding pass for the non-stop flight from several airports. <br />
<br />
Travel trade sources said the airline should either extend the New York flight to Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram airports or introduce a connecting flight in the evening linking the two airports to end the undue waiting in Mumbai airport of those opting through baggage check-in facility from the domestic points in the country.<br />

 <br />
Low Cost Carrier (LCC) Deccan is looking to develop and operate low-cost airports in Karnataka. It has formed a consortium with Mumbai International Airport Ltd. (MIAL), the Raheja Group and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) for submitting Expression of Interest (EOI) to the Karnataka Government for setting-up four low costs airports, according to GR Gopinath, Managing Director, Deccan. He added that the proposed airports will come up at Bijapur, Shimoga, Bellary and Gulbarga and each airport will entail an investment of Rs 15-20 crore. The Deccan consortium will have to compete with the likes of Tata-Changi consortium, which is also keen to bag these projects.</div></div><hr />

Prez perks (http://www.ibnlive.com/news/prez-perks-rs-400cr-airport-for-patils-hometown/53881-3.html?xml)<br />
<br />
The Maharashtra state administration is gearing up to develop the infrastructural facilities in Amravati, the hometown of President Pratibha Patil. A new airport with an estimate budget of Rs 400 crore will be built soon in Amravati. This construction has been approved inspite of Nagpur airport being just a three-hour drive away from Amravati.<br />
<br />
The decision to spend crores for an airport has been taken even as the state government remains unwilling to write off the loans of debt-ridden Vidarbha farmers. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, President of Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, Kishor Tiwari told CNN-IBN that he will speak to the President regarding the matter.<br />
<br />
�Vidarbha and Amravati has lakhs of families in deep distress. Over 3,000 families have been affected by farmer suicides. But the state government is not spending Rs 50 crore for food security but is ready to spend Rs 400 crore for a new airport. This is very unfortunate. We will talk to Pratibha tai and then take to the roads,� Tiwari said.<br />
<br />
Reacting sharply to the allegation that farmers are getting a raw deal while more is being spent on infrastructural development, Managing Director of Maharashtra Airport Development Company, RC Sinha said Government funds are not being misused.<br />
<br />
�Amravati is major business hub. Nagpur is 350 kms so infrastructure is needed for development. It�s wrong to say that we are ignoring other developments or funds are misused. Cultivators are themselves volunteering lands because they want to shift from primary to secondary sector,� Sinha explained.<br />
<br />
The initial plan was to upgrade the existing airstrip in the town. But as the National Highway Number 6 and the Yavatmal-Amravati Highway were proving a hindrance, on Saturday, it was decided that a new airport will be built, enabling the President and her family to fly directly to their hometown.<br />
<br />
Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel has also confirmed that the decision is final.<br />
<br />
&quot;We expect that she may visit Amravati around five times a year and we are looking at strengthening the existing infrastructure, including airport and rail network, to facilitate her arrival and stay,&quot; PTI quoted Minister of State for Finance Sunil Deshmukh as saying.<br />
<br />
Around 300 hectares of land belonging to Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation and 100 hectares of state government land could be used for upgrading the airport.<br />
<br />
The proposal to improve the facilities started after a series of embarrassments resulting from Patil's first trip as President to her hometown a month ago.<br />
<br />
On the cards is a Raj Bhavan-like guest house, an airport, and the linking of the Amravati and Badnera railway stations. <br />
<br />
From the looks of it, it seems that the main reason for the new airport is so that the President can have a better trip home. Maybe more media investigations will bring out the truth. <br />
<br />
Is Amravati a major business hub?</div></div><hr />

The two-way economy fare in the Mumbai-New York sector was reduced from Rs.80,000 to Rs.34,000. <br />
<br />
Airline sources said the fares had again been reduced to Rs.32,900 from the first week of December. Of course, the traveller will have to pay a tax of Rs.15,770 in addition to the fare. Airline sources said the demand for the non-stop flight was picking up. <br />
<br />
As part of marketing the flight to New York, the airline is already offering through baggage check-in facility and international boarding pass for the non-stop flight from several airports. <br />
<br />
Travel trade sources said the airline should either extend the New York flight to Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram airports or introduce a connecting flight in the evening linking the two airports to end the undue waiting in Mumbai airport of those opting through baggage check-in facility from the domestic points in the country.<br />

<br />
The first thing they need to do is get rid of all IAS officers from management positions in Air India (I mean I respect them and all that, but knowing the capitals of all states in India or having in-depth knowledge of Indian History  does not contribute anything to the aviation sector) and keep people who know the aviation field: origin destination demand and supply; the Hub-spoke concept, marketing research etc. etc.....<br />
<br />
A friend of mine working for Continental airlines here in Houston tells me how AI has monopolized ground handling in all major international airports in India, a huge source of revenue for them in addition to the common Indian tax payer's money.....so they don't have to care about customer service or making their routes efficient......</div></div><hr />

Real estate company Omaxe Ltd has submitted its bid for revamping Udaipur Airport. The bid for the Rs 200-crore project, invited by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, is among the first of the 24 non-metro airports out of 35 taken up for development by the Government through public-private partnership.<br />
<br />
�With the Government opening avenues, we see a good opportunity of being an important contributor towards the development of the country�s infrastructure,� Mr Rohtas Goel, Chairman and Managing Director of Omaxe Ltd, said. <br />
<br />
Recently, the Government made a move to modernise 24 non-metro airports and to maximise revenues of these airports. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
CHENNAI: Chennai-based Star Aviation is one of the first airlines to have been awarded a licence from the Ministry of Civil Aviation to begin scheduled regional operations. It is likely to launch flights next July and August, connecting Chennai with Bangalore, Hyderabad and several smaller airports in the region such as Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Visakhapatnam.<br />
<br />
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced the regional airlines scheme on August 23 as part of its �Hub and Spoke� policy to connect larger metro airports with tier-2 and tier-3 towns. The Government will provide a range of incentives for regional operators such as waivers in landing and parking charges and Aviation Turbine Fuel.<br />
<br />
The scheme restricts aircraft operations for a regional airline to within its specific zone � North, West, South and East/Northeast are the four zones designated by the DGCA. Each zone will have one metro airport as a hub, and regional airlines will not be allowed to connect metro airports across zones. For instance, a Northern regional airline cannot fly to Kolkata or Mumbai. <br />
<br />
The south is the only region with three designated metros � Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Southern regional operators will be allowed to connect the three metros. �We are likely to initially lease ATR turbo-prop aircraft as well as a jet aircraft for our operations,� T.V. Dorairaj, a director at Star Aviation, told The Hindu. �The board will meet next week to finalise destinations, routes as well as the number of aircraft.� <br />

<br />
Ananth Krishnan <br />
<br />
It will seek to establish �national presence,� begin international operations  <br />
<br />
<br />
CHENNAI: Having consolidated its business in the south, Chennai-based Paramount Airways will expand its operations to western India by the end of next year, seek to establish �national presence,� and begin international operations by 2011, managing director M. Thiagarajan said here on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
The airline, which now has a 26 per cent market share in the southern region, also announced an expansion in its southern operations. It will launch a direct service from Chennai to Visakhapatnam and begin flights to Tiruchirapalli in January. It plans to increase the frequency of flights to Bangalore and Hyderabad by next March, when new airports in the cities will be in operation.<br />
<br />
Mr. Thiagarajan said the airline will effect a �staggered� expansion of its fleet starting next year, adding a total of 40 aircraft over the next four years. It currently operates five Embraer jets. It is �evaluating� the purchase of Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 �Dreamliners� for its planned international operations.<br />
<br />
Business model <br />
<br />
<br />
In the south, the airline�s business is built on connecting metros like Chennai and Bangalore to tier-2 towns like Kochi, Coimbatore and Trivandrum. It will replicate the model in the western region, operating with Mumbai as a hub and flying to destinations like Surat, Goa and Ahmedabad. <br />
<br />
The airline largely targets business travellers, marketing itself as a �high-value� carrier. �We�re not the cheapest mode of transport, but we are the preferred choice for the segment we are targeting. Corporate travellers, business people and the trading community are most frequent air-travellers, making up around 85 per cent of air travel.� <br />
<br />
With several low-cost carriers incurring losses, Indian markets were not yet suited to the low-cost idea of air-travel. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">luvBlore</div><div class="date">December 13th, 2007, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Air cargo business: Loaded with possibilities <br />
  <br />
The boom in the economic activity in the country and entry of many new players have boosted the air cargo business that is growing by leaps and bounds, finds out B S Arun. <br />
 <br />
Booming passenger traffic in Indian skies is making unprecedented waves with growth anywhere between 30 to 50 per cent in the last three years but a lesser known fact is that the business of air cargo has not lagged behind.<br />
<br />
Registering nearly 20 per cent growth in the last three years (both domestic and international), specially 34 per cent growth in domestic cargo in the last one year, air cargo sector left the rail and shipping sector far behind in growth. The growth in total tonnage of cargo carried was 10.3 per cent and 9.2 per cent in shipping and railway cargo, respectively, during the last three years.<br />
<br />
As for the total air cargo carried in the country, Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel told Parliament on November 29 that it was 13.97 lakh metric tonne in 2005-06 and 15.5 LMT in 2006-07. The market expected to grow to 125 LMT from seven LMT by 2025.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What is boosting air cargo growth in India? According to the Assocham study, economic expansion, robust commercial activity and fast growing food processing sector have led to strong and secular growth in air cargo traffic. <br />
<br />
Loaded performance<br />
<br />
Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation�s Kapil Kaul paints a bright picture for cargo trade. He told Deccan Herald, �India now ranks in the top 30 global freight markets, both in terms of total and international operations after five years of strong growth. But despite growth, India�s total market size is still small on a global scale � two per cent of the US and five of China�s.� <br />
<br />
According to Vineet Kanaujia, GM (Marketing) of Safexpress,  the government and the industry are hoping for around 10 per cent contribution of air cargo in the transport business by 2010 from the present two per cent.The major commodities being air freighted out of India are garments, machinery, components, pharmaceuticals, dyes, chemicals and perishables such as fruit, flowers, vegetables, fish and meat. <br />
<br />
The industry is buoyant as the state-run Air India has dedicated cargo flights and expanded its tie-up with other players while more dedicated cargo airlines will take off in the next couple of years.  <br />
<br />
AI has converted two A310s aircraft (capacity 30 tonne) into international cargo carriers which now connect Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai with Paris and Frankfurt. Two more aircraft will be converted in one year. <br />
<br />
Following the decision to convert Alliance Air (of Indian Airlines) planes into cargo carriers, the merged entity has converted one Boeing 737 aircraft and gave it to India Post which connects Kolkata with North-East. AI also entered into an agreement with private player Gati for five aircraft � it has already handed over one Boeing while three more will be given in three months� time. �Both India Post and Gati aircraft have been doing very well going full capacity of 12.5 tonne. They want more planes,� said an AI official. Thrilled by the success, India Post has approached planning commission for five more freighters. <br />
<br />
Many players <br />
<br />
AI is the market leader in the air cargo segment flying over 40 per cent of cargo. �We did a business of Rs 850 crore in 2006-07 and with good growth, we expect it to go up to Rs 1000 crore this fiscal,� according to an AI official. While all the passenger airlines carry cargo in the aircraft belly, Blue Dart is the only dedicated private air cargo airline giving tough competition to AI. Blue Dart operates six freighters taking its capacity 250 tonnes while connecting all the major cities in India. <br />
<br />
Although other logistics players don�t yet operate own air cargo, they have made some serious planning. Said Kanaujia: �Safexpress is leasing three aircraft in 2008-09. The proposed Nagpur cargo airport will be our base and five major cities our hubs. With current revenue around Rs 500 crore and a growth rate of 30 per cent we expect a bright future by adding air cargo section too.� According to the Company�s CMD Pawan Jain, Safexpress will invest around Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years on infrastructure expansion.<br />
<br />
Another major player, First Flight Couriers plans to enter air cargo market by taking on lease two Boeing 737-300 to increase capacity in this space, connecting all the metros. Logistics start-up Avicore Aviation plans to invest about Rs 400 crore to launch a new cargo airline before mid-2008 and the firm is looking to lease or buy five B737s.<br />
<br />
Quickjet is another player wanting to launch air cargo. As per the initial plan, Quickjet will flag off services with two B757s. While a South Indian newspaper has announced plans to launch a cargo airline by ordering for five new Airbus freighter aircraft, Karnataka mining magnet Santosh Lad is planning to expand his Rs 3,000-crore business empire by foraying into the air cargo space. Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) may come in as a partner in the project. According to reports, the former MLA plans to revamp his recently acquired Chennai-based cargo company Crescent Air Cargo, connecting mainly South Indian cities.<br />
<br />
The lure of money has also attracted large passenger airlines. Almost all major full-service and budget airlines want to launch dedicated cargo carriers. Jet Airways Chairman Naresh Goyal has disclosed plans of starting a cargo airline next year. <br />
<br />
He has said that with India�s cross-border trade growing, there was a need for air cargo services. Realising the need to upgrade  facilities, the government has planned an airport exclusively for cargo at Nagpur which will come up at a cost of Rs 2600 crore. It will, however, take a few years to be completed. AI and SATS will invest Rs 80 crore for cargo handling facility at the new Bangalore airport which will be ready by April, 2008.<br />
<br />
Extending support<br />
<br />
On the policy front, the government may increase the upper limit for FDI in cargo operations from the existing 49 per cent. When it happens, the sector may attract more players, further boosting it. <br />
<br />
As the industry is still in its nascent stage, problems too are galore. Apart from the infrastructure constraints, the recent government action in reducing the �Free period� for cargo clearance at airports to three days from five has caused concern for the industry. The industry says it will be difficult to clear cargo in three days, given the infrastructure bottleneck at airports and delays in getting clearances. <br />
<br />
With the increase in cargo volume, the trade was planning to ask for an increase in free time, to seven days from five. The Air Cargo Agents Association of India has taken up the issue saying that the free period should be in terms of hours from touchdown of the flight and not calendar days. <br />
<br />
While providing infrastructure is a key issue, the government should look at an International Air Transport Association study which says that India is failing to keep pace with expected airfreight demand and a capacity crunch may hit as early as 2011. <br />
<br />
�IATA is forecasting a tumultuous year for the Indian airfreight market because its infrastructure will not be able to cope with the massive growth expected,� it said. <br />
<br />
India will have to play major part with an expected whopping 57 per cent of the world�s airfreight to be moved within Asia by 2011 but infrastructure constraints may be a serious bottleneck. Providing infrastructure for air cargo by the government  will have to be a priority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Press Trust of India <br />
BEIJING, Dec. 13: Star Alliance, the 19-member global airline grouping, today voted to accept India's national carrier Air India in the club that offers passengers a choice of over 17,000 daily flights across 160 countries. <br />
�Air India is delighted in being invited to join Star Alliance... In addition, the recently announced fleet expansion of more than 100 aircraft will help Air India serve the travelling public better in terms of global reach and services,� Air India's chairman and managing director, Mr V Thulasidas said in a statement. <br />
The decision to accept Air India into the grouping was taken by the Star Alliance board that met here today. <br />
Star Alliance board chairman, Mr Glenn Tilton, who also heads United Airlines, said: �India has long been on the radar of Star Alliance... Having now come to an agreement with Air India makes us the first airline alliance to secure a member in India, which will enable our customers to receive more benefits when travelling to, from and within India in the future.� <br />
Mr Thulasidas said that the Indian carrier would now be able to offer more value to passengers patronising member airlines of the alliance. <br />
The specialised teams at Air India, Star Alliance and its member carriers will now be working on the integration process, which once completed, will make India's flag carrier a part of the Star Alliance network. <br />
Star Alliance members include Singapore Airlines, US Airways, United, Swiss and Lufthansa.<br />

<br />
<br />
The Government has given permission to JetLite Airline to start regular operations between Amritsar and Bangkok. While confirming this development, official sources told Business Line that the airline plans to offer a low-cost alternative for passengers wanting to fly between the two cities.<br />
<br />
The launch of this flight will be the airline�s first international operation after Air Sahara was taken over by Jet Airways earlier this year and renamed JetLite.<br />
<br />
Winter schedule <br />
<br />
While company officials were tightlipped on when the operations would begin, sources said that JetLite has been asked to start during the winter schedule 2007-08. Globally, the winter schedule of airlines runs for about five months beginning from October end and finishing at the end of March the following year. <br />
<br />
The start of operations would see JetLite�s international network increase as the airline currently operates flights to Kathmandu and Colombo. The airline has also applied to the Government to operate flights to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait, the airline�s Chief Executive, Mr Garry Kingshott, had told presspersons in October. <br />
<br />
The airline plans to launch low-cost flights from India to the Gulf region by the first quarter of next year, if all Government permissions are granted, he added. <br />
<br />
Interestingly, before the buyout of Air Sahara was completed, it had applied to the Government for permission to operate on the Delhi-Bangkok-Guangzhou (China) and Delhi Bangkok-Delhi routes. <br />
<br />
Amritsar, like several other smaller cities around the country is becoming a popular destination for global airlines to launch regular operations. <br />
<br />
Singapore Airlines operates regular flights to Singapore, Air India operates flights to Birmingham and Toronto and Jet Airways has operations to the London from Amritsar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Packed flights and a fast growing market have prompted Thai Airways into augment its operations from Hyderabad from the current three flights a week to five flights a week, starting January 16, 2008. The airline is also looking at increasing its frequency to Chennai from four flights a week to making it a daily service by April, 2008.<br />
<br />
Ravinder Talwar, Area Sales Manager - India, Thai Airways, said, &quot;We commenced operations from Hyderabad in October, 2006. It is a fast growing market with a lot of IT potential and our load factors in the city are quite high. Considering the increase in the corporate traffic, we decided it was imperative to increase our frequency from three to five flights per week from Hyderabad. We plan to make it a daily service at a later stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking about the proposed changes in its Chennai operations, Talwar added, &quot;Currently, we operate on the Bangkok-Chennai-Dubai-Chennai-Bangkok route. As we have permission to fly to Dubai only four times a week, we have the same frequency of flights to Chennai. But now we are confident of starting daily flights to Chennai. On four days of the week, we will fly from Chennai to Dubai and on the remaining days, the flight will directly take off to Bangkok.&quot;<br />
<br />
In terms of marketing the new schedule of flights from Hyderabad, the airline plans to carry out promotional campaigns in both, the print and electronic media. The airline also plans to offer economically priced tickets, with a marginal difference between the economy and business class seats, so that more customers can travel business class. Currently, the airline operates daily flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bangalore; four flights a week from Chennai and Gaya-Varanasi and three flights a week from Hyderabad.</div></div><hr />

Maximising Real Opportunity<br />
<br />
The growing number of aviation companies setting up MRO facilities in India shows that the country has a huge potential of becoming an MRO hub. By Gayatri Vijaykumar <br />
<br />
Civil aviation in India has come a long way since the first commercial flight took place between Karachi and Delhi in 1912. Since then, the landscape has changed dramatically. Competition has helped reduce airfares that in turn have helped air travel shed its dubious distinction of being an elitist activity and becoming more accessible to the common Indian. Adding to this growing optimism is the modernisation and development of greenfield airports throughout the country. <br />
<br />
With the government proposing investments of US$ 9 billion by 2010 to modernise the country's airports, the stage is all set to boost India into the global aviation scene. An important area where the country still has a long way to go however is in providing world-class maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities. It is a well-known fact that every hour spent on the ground increases the airline's operating costs. Hence, in order to reduce costs and to optimise operations, it is essential to have efficient MRO facilities which would help reduce the time spent by the airline on the ground. <br />
<br />
The current scenario <br />
<br />
According to a GMR spokesperson, a world-class third party MRO facility does not exist in India right now. Explains the spokesperson, &quot;Hence, domestic airlines have to go overseas for heavy maintenance checks on aircraft, engine and components. This obviously involves a lot of foreign exchange drain.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amit Kishore Prasad, co-founder and joint managing director of HAMCO AeroZone - India's first 'aviation park' - feels that the MRO facility in the country at present is insufficient to support the growing demand. According to him, maintenance requirements in India are more stringent than other countries worldwide. &quot;In the US, there is no need to do a transit check by an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (AME) each time a flight lands and is taking off. The pilot can himself certify the same. In India, you need AMEs for these transit checks also. Then there are 'A' checks (typically 600 hours of flying), night-halt checks, weekly checks and 'C' checks (between 1800 and 3000 hours of flying). All these need a lot of manpower, resources and facilities which aren't easily available in India today,&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
He adds that as per a 2010 projection, the facilities will be a quarter of that required by the number of aircraft. This will lead to a lot of foreign exchange draining out of the country as aircraft will need to go to those destinations for maintenance. <br />
<br />
The GMR spokesperson adds that a third party MRO would not only reduce costs but also increase availability of aircraft by not having to ferry it overseas for repairs. Consequently, it would save foreign exchange. &quot;The MRO sector in India is presently lacking a world-class MRO facility. In addition, the expertise of MRO for heavy maintenance has not yet been established in the country. Since airlines have to go outside the country for heavy maintenance checks on aircraft, engine and components, aircraft have to stay out of service for longer periods. This financially burdens the airlines,&quot; states the spokesperson. <br />
<br />
MROs in the pipeline <br />
<br />
The southern cities of Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad are emerging as major players in the MRO scene. Jet Airways has plans of setting up an MRO and is considering a few southern cities. According to Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, its CEO, the cost of the project is estimated to be around US$ 60 million. &quot;However, how much Jet will invest depends on the decision of whether it is planning to go on its own or with a joint venture partner,&quot; he adds. Kingfisher Airlines and Deccan are also actively looking at setting up an MRO in Bangalore, which in addition to servicing their fleet will also be open to third parties. <br />
<br />
The GMR group has entered into a joint venture with Lufthansa Technik to set up an MRO facility at Hyderabad International Airport Limited (HIAL). To be developed with an investment of more than Rs 100 crore for the initial phase, Lufthansa Technik holds 75.5 per cent stake while the GMR Group holds 24.5 per cent stake. Scheduled to commence operations in the last quarter of 2008, the day-to-day running of the facility will be carried out by Lufthansa Technik while the GMR Group will have a proportionate share of the dividends. <br />
<br />
According to the spokesperson for GMR, for the initial phase, the MRO infrastructure at HIAL covering 6.92 acres will provide heavy maintenance services (including 'C' and 'D' checks) for the Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 family (including 737 Classic and 737 NG). Services will be expanded to include wide-body aircraft like Airbus A330/340 and Boeing 777/787 based on market demand. The hangar facility will initially consist of a two-bay narrow body hangar with modular design which can later be expanded to include a single-bay wide body hangar. &quot;The facility would obtain DGCA as well as internationally recognised FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) approvals,&quot; explains the GMR spokesperson. <br />
<br />
Private MRO facility for commercial aircraft Hyderabad Airport Maintenance Company (HAMCO) plans to start operations in mid-2008. Prasad explains, &quot;Our differentiator is that our founding team comprises AMEs who are technically capable of handling high-end requirements of airlines. AMEs are in short supply in the market and fast becoming a limiting factor in the growth of MRO facilities in India.&quot; According to him, AeroZone will be a 400-plus acre campus offering MRO, training and allied services to airlines. It will also have its own private airstrip to facilitate the arrival and departure of customer aircraft. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why India? <br />
<br />
The fact that most big names in the aviation industry are looking at India to set up their MRO facilities shows that India has the potential of becoming a global hub. Foreign companies like Boeing, Airbus and SIA Engineering are looking at entering into joint ventures with Indian companies to set up MRO facilities in the country. Says the GMR spokesperson, &quot;The aviation sector has seen phenomenal growth since the Indian government initiated an open skies policy with foreign airlines and permitted domestic airlines to fly international routes. This interest will spur new opportunities for equipment and project finance such as modernisation and upgrading of existing airports, construction of new domestic and international airports, which would help India emerge as an MRO hub of the world.&quot; <br />
<br />
It is also considered to be more profitable to set up MRO facilities in India. Having MRO facilities in the country will save us foreign exchange. Says the GMR source, &quot;The MRO business will also generate numerous related ancillary and associated industries and services. These centres also generate a large volume of employment, for example LHT is looking at around 300-400 people working for them in the project.&quot;<br />
<br />
The geographical location of the country also helps. &quot;India is in between Europe (that has high labour cost) and Far East Asia. Moreover, the increase in the number of airlines can bring in significant cost savings to them,&quot; explains Prock-Schauer. Add to this is the availability of talent in the country. &quot;India has good engineering schools with many young talented people. They have to be trained for specific task and type of aircraft. With good planning, this should not be a problem for India,&quot; he says. <br />
<br />
Most international airports being developed in the country have the capacity to handle MRO facilities. Hyderabad International Airport, Bangalore International Airport, Delhi International Airport, Mumbai International Airport and Chennai International Airport - all are being considered by various private Indian and foreign companies to set up MRO facilities. Prasad feels that all airports in the country are suitable for setting up MRO facilities. &quot;An MRO facility does not need much space - about two to three acres for a hangar and 10,000 square feet for office space and components parking are sufficient. So all airports in India including the smaller ones are suitable,&quot; he explains. <br />
<br />
However, the GMR spokesperson cautions that the economic viability of setting up multiple MRO centers has to be looked into since airlines are direct customers for MRO business and only limited aircraft in private sector are available for services. &quot;With Indian having captive MRO and the merger of Jet Airways and Sahara, the industry is also witnessing a consolidation of sorts. All other private airlines are new and hence not ready for MRO checks,&quot; he explains. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hurdles to cross <br />
<br />
The country, however, faces challenges galore before it can find its name on the global MRO map. According to Prock-Schauer, the current system of tax on technical service for work done within the country provides disadvantages for MROs to set up shops on their own without a local airline partner. In addition, the lack of proper infrastructure and availability of land at key airports adds to the problem. <br />
<br />
However, he adds that a good business plan can offer maintenance cost and a favorable tax regime that will lead to a lower cost of maintenance work done in India as compared to maintenance work done abroad. This is due to the cost saved on ferrying flights and ground time. <br />
<br />
Prasad feels that the lack of clarity in government policies is a major concern. Praasd laments, &quot;We applied to the government for space in Hyderabad's Begumpet airport in early 2006. We were made to run from pillar to post between Airport Authority of India and DGCA for two years. AAI wants us to get approvals and will then give us space while DGCA says that it cannot give approval to those who do not have space in airports. There is also some 1930 rule which states that 'non airlines' cannot be given space inside any airport, which has drastically affected our plan.&quot; <br />
<br />
According to him, another challenge will be the conflict of interest between the airport developer and the provider of such services. Prasad cautions, &quot;The private operators of major airports of India are not encouraging MRO players and are getting into joint ventures and partnerships to build a monopoly situation at their own airport. This will significantly hamper the growth of MROs in India. The government better wake up soon, else we will end up with poor quality maintenance, risky flights, loss of domestic revenue to international players and above all miss a big opportunity to become a regional aviation hub. Let us not let that happen!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The boards of Kingfisher Airlines and Deccan Aviation late Wednesday decided to merge both the airlines. The name of the merged entity will most probably be Kingfisher Airlines. <br />
<br />
In this manner, there will be no delisting of Deccan Aviation from the stock exchanges. Dr Vijay Mallya told newspersons today that any listed entity can change its name just as any listed entity can acquire or merge with the boards� approval. After the stock ratio is finalised, UB Holdings will have in excess of 51 per cent in the merged entity. <br />
<br />
These changes will take effect before March 2008. The new entity will start functioning from the next fiscal. The brand Deccan will continue to remain. <br />
<br />
Earlier in the day, the board of Deccan Aviation considered a report from Accenture Consulting which has suggested a merger with Kingfisher Airlines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cncity</div><div class="date">December 20th, 2007, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">International airport to initially focus on cargo exports.  <br />
  <br />
Acting on the directives from the Civil Aviation ministry, the Maharashtra government has finally initiated the land acquisition process for the much-awaited international airport project near Pune.  <br />
  <br />
Planned at Shiroli-Chandoos villages and located around 45 km north of Pune along the Pune-Nashik national highway, the greenfield international airport is expected to be operational by the year 2016.  <br />
  <br />
The international airport will initially focus on cargo exports as the passenger needs would be extensively served by the upcoming international airport near Panvel in Navi Mumbai, which is just 90 minutes� drive from Pune. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) has issued a notice to begin the land acquisition procedure.  <br />
  <br />
The proposed international airport would come on 6,000 acres, which according to MIDC, is not under direct irrigation. The airport site is surrounded by industrial estates like Talegaon, Chakan and Rajgurunagar, where multinationals including JCB, General Motors, Daimler Chrysler, International Truck and Engines Corporation, Tata Motors and Volkswagen have a presence. Two multi-product special economic zones (SEZs) planned by Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Kalyani Forge are also coming up near the airport site, which ensure that the airport initially would work as a cargo export-import hub.  <br />
  <br />
The development comes a sigh of relief for the industrial community as well as the residents of Pune and surrounding regions, who had to travel to Mumbai for international operations. The present airport in Pune is governed by the Indian Air Force (IAF). The airport is presently undergoing runway re-carpeting work, which has severely affected the city�s air traffic scenario.  <br />
  <br />
The state government has already invited expression of interest (EOIs) from private agencies to conduct a techno-economic feasibility study of the new airport, which has received the green signal from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Defence ministry.  <br />
  <br />
�By the time this airport comes up, the international airport at Panvel would be around four-year-old. Hence, the new airport will target the industrial zones around Pune and will capitalise on goods and machinery export,� an MIDC official told Business Standard.  <br />
  <br />
The airport would be a public-private partnership venture to be developed on the lines of international airports coming up in Bangalore and Hyderabad. The MIDC would hold 15 per cent share in the project with two or three private partners.  <br />
  <br />
�Once the techno-economical feasibility report is ready, it would be forwarded to the Government of India for approval. Once we receive the go-ahead from the Centre, we will take the possession of land followed by an international bidding procedure. If things happen as per plan, the construction can start in 2011,� the official stated.  <br />

It is good that AAI is allowing creativity to flourish, instead of the stodgy, cookie-cutter CPWD designs they have usually used in the past.  But follow through is equally important and that is where I worry about these airports remaining with AAI.  They will not maintain these new facilities properly and they will not expand them in a timely manner (even according to the original master plan).</div></div><hr />

http://www.business-standard.com/common/storypage.php?autono=308438&amp;leftnm=1&amp;subLeft=0&amp;chkFlg=<br />
<br />
Air India�s fourth Boeing 777-200LR, scheduled for delivery in the second week of December, has not reached the airline. A shortage of commanders for the new generation aircraft will probably delay it further.  <br />
  <br />
�Air-India could not take deliveries of two of its 777LRs from the manufacturer on time because it did not have enough pilots to fly these aircraft,� said a pilot with the airline on condition of anonymity.  <br />
  <br />
The national carrier finds itself in a situation where deliveries are underway for its Rs 35,000-crore order for 69 aircraft (eight B777-200LRs, 16 777�300ERs, 27 787 Dreamliners and 18 B737-800s). Air-India has only 22 commanders to fly the B777 family of aircraft.  <br />
  <br />
Air-India refused to confirm the number. �The entire delivery schedule for the 777LRs has been awkwardly planned by Air-India. There is an acute shortage of pilots as well as engineers trained for the aircraft,� sources close to the developments said, adding: �The airline is now into a major training spree both for its pilots as well as its engineers. But it is impacting the operational schedules of the airline.�  <br />

<br />
Expanding its long-haul route network, Air India said it would launch a non-stop service from Delhi to New York from February eight with a new Boeing 777 aircraft.<br />
<br />
The national carrier, which launched a similar service from Mumbai in August this year, would take delivery of a brand new Boeing 777-200 in the next few weeks and use it for the Delhi-New York operations.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have scheduled the launch of this non-stop flight for February 8,&quot; a senior Air India official said.<br />
<br />
Air India has so far received four 777-200 LRs (Long Range) as per schedule agreed with the US aircraft major Boeing, he said. <br />

Boeing signs $1-bn deal with HAL (http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News_by_Industry/Boeing_signs_1-bn_deal_with_HAL/articleshow/2638775.cms)<br />
<br />
Boeing Co and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd on Thursday signed a deal aimed at bringing more than $1 billion of new aerospace manufacturing work to India, a joint statement said.<br />
<br />
The preliminary agreement was signed in New Delhi by Jim Albaugh, president of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, and Ashok Baweja, chairman of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), the statement said.<br />
<br />
The pact also includes sharing key Boeing business and manufacturing tools with Bangalore-based HAL, India's leading aerospace company which designs and manufactures advanced fighters.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am extremely pleased that Boeing and HAL have agreed to work together for the mutual benefit of their companies and countries,&quot; said Albaugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;The agreement represents an important step in our efforts to build solid long-term partnerships in India to make Boeing products more globally competitive,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
Under the deal, Boeing and HAL will explore business opportunities aimed at transferring work packages to India with an initial value of 10-20 million dollars annually, growing in size and complexity as opportunities develop.<br />
<br />
Chicago-headquartered Boeing also will support HAL in developing manufacturing processes needed for the production of hardware for Boeing and its subcontractors.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a significant step by two aerospace leaders that opens up new avenues and areas of cooperations. HAL and Indian industry gain from this long-term business arrangement in terms of technology upgrade,&quot; said Baweja.<br />
<br />
In December 2003, Boeing established a wholly owned subsidiary, Boeing International Corp India Private Ltd (BICIPL), to support the growing demands of India's aviation, aerospace and defence industries.<br />

JV firms awarded Gondia (MH), Lucknow airport projects (http://www.travelbizmonitor.com/articleDetails.aspx?id=1800&amp;sectionid=36&amp;name=Top%20Stories)<br />
<br />
The Airports Authority of India has awarded expansion projects at Lucknow and Gondia airports to two joint venture companies. The construction of a new integrated passenger terminal building at Lucknow Airport in Uttar Pradesh has been awarded to a joint venture called IPL Brahmaputra Infrastructure Ltd., formed by Indu Projects Ltd, Hyderabad, and Brahmaputra Consortium Ltd., New Delhi. The contract, valued at Rs 80 crore, is expected to be completed in 18 months. Airports Authority of India received seven bids out of which IPL Brahmaputra was selected for the work, said Anupam Verma, Senior Manager, AAI. Civil work on the project commenced in November this year.<br />
<br />
The work for the construction of a new passenger lounge at Gondia Airport in Maharashtra has also been awarded to a joint venture called Parnika Vishal Consortium Ltd. formed by Parnika Constructions Pvt. Ltd. of Hyderabad and Vishal Constructions of Belgaum, Karnataka, an AAI spokesperson said. The value of the contract is Rs 41.57 crore. The consortium has already started civil work, which is expected to be completed in 12 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
HYDERABAD: Contrary to its earlier plans to convert the Begumpet airport into a training centre or a remote check-in point for travellers once the Shamshabad airport becomes functional, the state government is now toying with the idea of developing, leasing or even selling it after the airport shuts shop in mid-March. <br />
<br />
According to sources, the state government is figuring out the total land that comes under the airport and is determining ownership details of this land. The land is worth thousands of crores in the present market situation. <br />
<br />
About 2,000 acres of land comes under the Begumpet airport and the government has sought &quot;full details&quot; about this land from the Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy district collectors. While a major chunk of this airport land falls in Hyderabad, an estimated 700 acres is in RR district. Part of Begumpet airport stretches to RR district (from Bowenpally side) and comes under village called Begumpet in Balanagar mandal. <br />
<br />
Sources say the government wants to determine &quot;the nature of the ownership of the land&quot; and whether it was initially government land that was given to the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and if so what were the conditions laid at that point of time. The government also wants to know whether any private land was acquired then. Whether the land acquired or given was at the prevailing market value or at any other rate is also being determined. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is being done in case the Begumpet airport falls into disuse after it ceases to be operational to figure out what should be done with the land,'' says a state official. <br />
<br />
Officials note that the Begumpet airport issue has come up in a few recent meetings, but its name surprisingly came up at a review meeting of sick units located on government land. It was during this meeting that land details of the airport was sought from the two district collectors.</div></div><hr />

A 2000 acre public park, ala Central Park in NYC (just ~2.5 times larger), with lots of trees and a few man-made lakes in the heart of the bustling city of Hyderabad wouldn't be a bad idea at all, IMHO.<br />

<br />
Salem-based Mukesh and Associates, which is the consultant of the project, has invited tenders for the construction of the hangars and allied works at an estimated cost of Rs 39 crore.<br />
<br />
The expected completion period of the work is 10 months. The State Government had handed over 15 acres of land adjacent to the airport, near Chakka, to Air India free of cost in September 2006 ....<br />
<br />
The last date for submitting the tender is January 23 and the tenders would be opened on the same day. Air India authorities had earlier claimed that the project would be completed within 18 months once they get possession of the land.<br />
<br />
The project would give a prominent place for the state capital in the aviation map of the country.<br />
<br />
The engineering base is being set up primarily to service Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which are being operated by Air India Express. Air India Express presently operates around 60 flights out of Kerala to various destinations in the Gulf.<br />
<br />
It has a fleet of seven aircraft and is planning to induct nearly 18 brand new 737-800 Boeing aircraft.<br />
<br />
Air India is also planning to induct 50 other new aircraft. Some of the line maintenance checks on these aircraft will be carried out at the proposed maintenance base here.<br />

Ananth Krishnan <br />
<br />
First Indian private carrier to connect India with destinations in the Gulf  <br />
<br />
CHENNAI: Jet Airways has become the latest airline to reach out to the growing West Asia market. Starting January 5, the airline will become the first Indian private carrier to connect India with destinations in the Gulf.<br />
<br />
Initially, it will launch two daily direct flights from Kochi to Bahrain and Kuwait as well as direct flights between Mumbai and Bahrain and New Delhi and Kuwait. <br />
<br />
High load factor <br />
<br />
<br />
According to Jet Airways CEO Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, the airline was launching the flights in light of the �consistently high load factor� that operators to the region were currently enjoying. There are already as many as ten different operators connecting Indian cities with the Gulf, including Air India, Emirates, Kuwait Airways, Oman Air, Air Arabia, Qatar Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Gulf Air and Thai Airways. These airlines largely cater to cities in the south such as Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai and Hyderabad, which are the sources of much of the labour traffic to Gulf countries.<br />
<br />
The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), an aviation consultancy, describes West Asia as the �fastest growing region in the world for passengers and air cargo.� According to CAPA�s figures, West Asia recorded a 15.4 per cent increase in Revenue Passenger Kilometres, which measures the volume of air traffic, last year. By all accounts, this region is set for further growth. <br />
<br />
Ten airports in the region are investing a total of $36.8 billion in on expansion, which will enable the region to handle an additional capacity of 318 million passengers by 2012.<br />
<br />
For airlines like Air India, West Asian routes have been the mainstay of its international revenues � the region contributes up to 30 per cent of the airline�s total revenues. K. Venkataraman, director, Diana World Travel, says Jet will face a challenge to replicate the success of airlines like Air India, which is built on the growing popularity of Dubai as a business and holiday destination. <br />
<br />
Jet Airways currently does not have permission from the Civil Aviation Ministry to fly to Dubai, but was hopeful of getting it soon. <br />
<br />
It will shortly add flights to Oman from Calicut by mid-January.<br />
<br />
�Most of the traffic is concentrated to Dubai because of its connectivity as well as attractions such as the Dubai shopping festival,� Mr. Venkataraman says. While around 80 per cent of the traffic is labour-oriented, this demographic is changing fast. <br />
<br />
�While historically a majority of traffic is with regard to labour, we are seeing an increasingly number of tourists and business travellers, especially to Dubai,� Mr. Venkataraman adds.<br />
<br />
Labour traffic <br />
<br />
<br />
He says with the high saturation on Dubai routes � Air India has daily flights and Emirates double-daily � other peripheral destinations might still provide a source of opportunity. �While the leisure and business travel is comparatively very less, there is still a significant amount of labour traffic in other areas.� <br />

Cos line up for Kolkata, Chennai airports<br />
 <br />
NEW DELHI: Global construction majors have lined up for the Rs 3,700-crore airport modernisation plans in Kolkata and Chennai. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has received 11 applications for the Rs 1,900-cr Kolkata project and 14 for the Rs 1,800-crore Chennai expansion programme. <br />
<br />
Apart from Indian majors like L&amp;T (which is building both the Delhi and Mumbai airports), the global names include Greece's AEGEK General Construction; Malaysia's Muhibbah Engineering and Britain's largest privately-owned construction firm Laing O'Rourke. <br />
The AAI is also going to appoint a project management consultant who would oversee the implementation of these two projects on a turnkey basis. Firms like US-based Louis Berger have applied for becoming the consultants. <br />
<br />
AAI has taken up Chennai and Kolkata airports as a sort of challenge, mainly to prove a point that it can also build good airports, especially when private majors like GMR and GVK already implementing projects in Delhi and Mumbai airports. <br />
<br />
&quot;Several leading construction firms from Korea, Thailand, US, Europe and some Indian top names have applied for building the two airports. Both Chennai and Kolkata have to get integrated domestic-cum-international terminals. Chennai would see major work on the runway too,&quot; said a senior official. <br />
<br />
The AAI has projected a total investment of Rs 12,430 crore in the 11th plan and a bulk of this would happen over the next three years when airports in Kolkata, Chennai, 35 non-metros, Agatti, Leh and J&amp;K would be upgraded. In addition, the authority will also undertake major modernisation work on air traffic management and communication and navigation services. <br />
<br />
&quot;The next fiscal will see an investment of Rs 3,000 crore. We will raise about Rs 1,000 crore from the market using instruments like bonds and ECBs. Given our AAA rating, getting funds is not an issue. We are already being approached by banks,&quot; said the official. <br />
<br />
The AAI will build terminals and operational areas in the non-metros and do complete modernisation at Kolkata and Chennai. The city-side development at non-metros will be done the PPP way. Already infrastructure majors like GMR, GVK, L&amp;T and Omaxe have expressed interests in the city side projects that would include developing parking areas, hotels and commercial areas inside the terminals. <br />
<br />
India is projected to witness an investment of Rs 41,000 crore in airport sector through private, AAI and JV ventures that could take the number of operational airports from over 100 to nearly 500</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are five of the Boeing 777 category, four Boeing 737s, eight Airbus A-320 family of aircraft and three Canadian Regional Jets (CRJs).<br />
<br />
As the government wants the newly merged carrier to compete with the best in the industry, the process of integration of the two erstwhile national carriers -- Air India and Indian Airlines -- is progressing smoothly, AI officials said. <br />

Jet Airways, Virgin forge frequent flier partnership (http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=f6b9efde-3487-481e-a1ca-f7671e512e0e&amp;MatchID1=4625&amp;TeamID1=1&amp;TeamID2=6&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1165&amp;MatchID2=4617&amp;TeamID3=3&amp;TeamID4=4&amp;MatchType2=1&amp;SeriesID2=1163&amp;PrimaryID=4625&amp;Headline=Jet+Airways%2c+Virgin+forge+frequent+flier+partnership)<br />
<br />
In a major initiative to provide more choices to its passengers and reward members of its frequent flier programme, Jet Airways has forged an alliance with Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic to offer facilities on a reciprocal basis.<br />
<br />
The partnership would offer Jet Airways' JetPrivilege members the benefit of accessing a choice of destinations on the Virgin Atlantic network. Similarly, Virgin Atlantic�s Flying Club members would be able to tap into Jet Airways vast domestic network, besides the various international destinations served by Jet Airways.<br />
<br />
Jet Airways said in a statement that JetPrivilege members would now be able to earn and redeem JPMiles on all Virgin Atlantic flights to over 34 destinations worldwide, including North America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and Australia.<br />
<br />
Virgin Atlantic�s Flying Club members would be able to earn and redeem their miles on Jet Airways with over 355 daily flights to 44 destinations in India or to international destinations such as New York (Newark and JFK), Toronto, London, Brussels, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Colombo, Kathmandu and Dhaka.<br />

Pune airport to be shut for 15 days in Feb (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Pune/Airport_to_be_shut_for_15_days_in_Feb/articleshow/2653869.cms)<br />
<br />
 PUNE: The city�s Lohegaon airport will remain closed for a fortnight, beginning February 12 next year to facilitate ongoing runway recarpeting and repair works.<br />
<br />
While the closure is 'inevitable' considering the complex recarpeting process, it will bear a negative impact on the seven airliners operating a total 28 flights from Pune including the sole international service to Dubai. Pune�s daily air passenger load, that is, the number of people flying out of and into the city, is pegged at 5,000.<br />
<br />
A senior airports authority of India (AAI) official at Lohegaon told TOI on Wednesday that AAI had received an intimation about the fortnight-long closure from the Indian Air Force (IAF) headquarters in New Delhi, which is directly monitoring the recarpeting work.<br />
<br />
The civil enclave is part of the IAF�s strategically vital fighter base. The runway recarpeting and repair, which started on September 15 and is expected to end in May 2008, was overdue considering the wear and tear on account of both, air force and civilian flight operations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bangalore�s HAL Airport, slated to become the busiest gateway to South India, recorded domestic passenger traffic figures of 4.9 million during April-October 2007, showing a growth of 35.3 per cent on a year-on-year basis. <br />
<br />
Chennai recorded domestic passenger traffic of 4.2 million during the period, while Hyderabad was about 3.2 million. <br />
<br />
During the same period last year, the domestic passenger traffic figures at Bangalore airport stood at 3.6 million, according to statistics available with the Aviation Centre of Excellence (ACEXC), Mumbai. <br />
<br />
Mr Narinder Kaushal, Airport Director, Airports Authority of India, Bangalore Airport, said that though Chennai recorded a higher growth in the number of passengers during the year, Bangalore still sees the highest passenger traffic after Delhi and Mumbai and is currently handling traffic of 10.3 million passengers. <br />
<br />
�The airport records 310 aircraft movements per day and we are trying to restrict new movements into the airport now,� he said. In 2006-07, HAL Airport recorded passenger traffic movement of 8.2 million.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See the rush of foreign nationals for the international flights. What are the authorities doing..?Around 500 Maldivians are stranded at Trivandrum Airport, because they cannot get flights back to Male�, reports Haveeru.<br />
<br />
And it is unlikely they will be able to get Indian Airline tickets home before the end of January, one stranded tourist said.<br />
<br />
�We are now becoming desperate,� he told Haveeru. �Some of us have run out of money and are now living on credit.�<br />
<br />
Some families had wired money to their stranded relatives, so they could try and get a seat on Sri Lankan Airlines.<br />
<br />
The Maldivian Consulate say they have received several reports of Maldivians stranded in Trivandrum, and have filed a complaint with the airlines.<br />
<br />
Maldivians who holiday in India this time of year are often unable to return because of a shortage of seats on Indian Airlines.<br />

�Those who have managed to confirm and OK their tickets are sent back from the airport when they go there, saying that the flight is full,� he said. �When Maldivians are unable to get a ticket they sometimes pay Indians 2000 or 3000 Rupees to get the tickets for them and they are easily able to get the tickets that the Maldivians were unable to get.�</div></div><hr />

Ajanta Chakraborty | TNN<br />
<br />
Kolkata: Never mind civil aviation minister Praful Patel�s comment that Kolkata doesn�t need a second airport, the state government has renewed its initiative for the greenfield airport project. The transport department has identified 6,000 acres of land in Uluberia for the project.<br />
    The ball was set rolling last week as transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, prodded by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, convened several meetings at Writers� Buildings.<br />
    �We have found the land in Uluberia. Around 6,000 acres will be needed for the greenfield airport. The project will take off soon and the airport will come up at Uluberia,� said Chakraborty.<br />
    The airport will have separate runways for domestic, international and cargo flights. It will have the capacity to cater to 40 million passengers annually as opposed to 0.8 million passengers handled by Dum Dum airport. The minister said the Uluberia land is appropriate for the second airport given its proximity to the city. �An airport must be easily accessible from the city.�<br />
    Only three months ago, at a time when the Left-UPA rift became apparent over the nuclear deal, Patel had stressed more on the modernisation of the existing airport at Rs 2,000 crore rather than setting up a new one. A senior state government official said, �At that point of time, the reason behind the Centre�s reluctance to set up a new airport was more political than administrative. Now things have changed and the aviation ministry has given us a feedback that the Centre will not come in the way of a second airport here.�<br />
    Patel had earlier argued against the viability of a greenfield airport when the existing one has the capacity to handle traffic for the next 20 years.<br />
    The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government isn�t buying this logic and<br />
has, therefore, put forth a feasibility study report prepared last year by Consulting Engineering Services (CES). The report said the second airport was absolutely necessary because even after a revamp, Dum Dum airport would only be able to accommodate 20 million passengers � but the capacity would saturate by 2015. The state government had since been trying to find land for the second airport. Steps were taken to identify land in South 24-Parganas, along the proposed Eastern Expressway. But this process was stalled after the government started facing opposition to the expressway project, which was supposed to be built by the Salim group.<br />
    �Since we couldn�t find the land, the second airport project had been shelved. Now that the land has been identified, we will be able to push for the airport project all over again,� said an official.<br />
    The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has, meanwhile, signed an agreement with a consortium led by Kolkata-based infrastructure developer Pragati47 for an aerotropolis in the industrial hub at Andal. Christened Bengal Aerotropolis Projects, the planned city with an airport as its core and surrounded by clusters of enterprises, would cost Rs 5,500 crore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also has to be built on an undeveloped &quot;green&quot; piece of land.  For example, if they demolished the current airport and built a brand new one from scratch on the same land it would not be considered a greenfield airport.</div></div><hr />

Posted: 03 January 2008 0005 hrs <br />
<br />
<br />
SINGAPORE - Budget carrier Tiger Airways said Wednesday it will begin services to Bangalore, its third destination in India. <br />
<br />
Tiger said it will operate four flights a week between Singapore and Bangalore from June 1. <br />
<br />
The airline already has services to two other southern Indian destinations, Kochi and Chennai. <br />
<br />
Tiger, 49 percent owned by national carrier Singapore Airlines, has been stepping up its regional operations. <br />
<br />
In November, Tiger said it had signed a letter of cooperation with Incheon city in South Korea to set up a new budget carrier based in that country. <br />
<br />
Tiger also began Australian domestic operations from a Melbourne base in November, and is among the low-cost carriers granted rights to fly the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route from February. <br />
<br />
Southeast Asia's low-cost sector has boomed since the birth of Malaysia-based AirAsia, almost six years ago, spawned a host of imitators.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
With civil air services being launched in the Indian Air Force (IAF) airstrip in Jaisalmer, Airport Authority of India (AAI) has decided to build a airport terminal 20 kilometres from the golden city by 2010. <br />
<br />
AAI has decided to start construction work of the new airport in Khudi village of the Jaisalmer. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are going to kick-off the construction of Rs 60 crore project very soon at Jailsamer,&quot; AAI Executive Director A Murugson said here. <br />
<br />
He said the construction of the airport terminal would be completed in next two years. <br />
<br />
&quot;Every foreign tourist visiting India wants to visit Jaisalmer and the expansion of air services will definitely attract more number of tourists.&quot; Murugson said. <br />
<br />
The terminal would have the capacity to park three aircrafts at a time, he added. <br />
<br />
Rajasthan government has already given around 60 acre land to AAI for the purpose. <br />
<br />
Currently AAI is using IAF airstrip and terminal to operate the air services to Jaisalmer that begun by Kingfisher from December 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
With more private players keen to enter the airport arena, the Government may allow new cargo airports to come up within a 150 km radius of an existing airport through the automatic route. <br />
<br />
At the moment, the Government policy does not allow any airport to come up within a 150 km of an existing airport. However, the thinking in the Government seems to be that any greenfield cargo airport project presented to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) after obtaining all clearances from the other authorities should be given the nod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New Delhi, Jan. 3 The Minister for Civil Aviation, Mr Praful Patel, will lay the foundation stone for the construction of a new integrated terminal building at Chandigarh airport tomorrow. <br />
<br />
An official statement issued here today said that Mr Patel would also be present at the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMDA) for the development of an international civil air terminal complex at Mohali.<br />
<br />
A new joint venture company, in which AAI would have a majority stake, would be formed. The joint venture company, in which GMDA would hold a minority stake, would also take up the city side development of the airports in the state. GMDA would acquire the required land from the State Government and give it to the joint venture company.<br />
<br />
At Chandigarh airport, AAI plans to construct an international terminal building having modular design which can handle 700 passengers apart from constructing a cargo complex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
New Delhi, Jan. 3 The proposal of the Uttar Pradesh Government for setting up a greenfield airport at Jewar has been referred to a Group of Ministers, the Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Mr Priyaranjan Dasmunshi, said on Thursday.<br />
<br />
Briefing newspersons after a meeting of the Union Cabinet, the Minister said that the new airport project is to come up 68 km from the existing airport here. <br />
<br />
The project cost is estimated at Rs 3,505 crore as per the feasibility report submitted by the State Government. According to the plan, the Taj Expressway Authority (TEA) would be nominated as the sponsor of the project and the TEA would acquire the land in accordance with the policy of the UP Government.<br />
<br />
The project would be implemented through a special purpose vehicle, which would be a joint venture with a private party to be selected through a competitive bidding process. The private party will hold 74 per cent stake in the joint venture, while the State Government will hold 13 per cent through the sponsor and the remaining 13 per cent would be held by other Government agencies such as the Airports Authority of India.<br />

<br />
<br />
The government is expecting to draw investment to the tune of Rs 2,00,000 crore in the aviation sector during next ten years, which will generate employment for 30 lakh people, Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel said on Friday. <br />
<br />
&quot;We expect that the civil aviation sector will attract an investment of Rs 2 lakh crore during next ten years,&quot; he said at a function for laying the foundation stone for the new integrated terminal building of Chandigarh airport here. <br />
<br />
Reiterating government's commitment to achieve inclusive growth, Patel sought support from states especially Punjab and Haryana for the development of country's aviation sector. <br />
<br />
&quot;The states should take necessary steps in building up the infrastructure which is still inadequate in the country and the union government will always be ready for helping them in this regard,&quot; he said</div></div><hr />

<br />
The airline on Saturday also launched three other daily direct flights -- Kochi-Kuwait, Delhi-Kuwait, Kochi-Bahrain. <br />
<br />
On the company's future expansion plans, Goyal said Jet was going to launch two new flights to Muscat and Doha (Qatar) from Calicut from January 23.</div></div><hr />

Mumbai, Jan 06: Buoyed by its success since starting operations two year ago, the national carrier's low-cost arm Air-India Express plans to add more international destinations after the Haj rush is over this month-end. <br />
<br />
AI Express, which started its operations only to West Asia, now operates from 13 cities in India to 12 foreign locations in the Middle-East, South Asia and Southeast Asia. It has flights from all the major cities in India to Gulf and now wants to connect to Johar Bahru in Malaysia, Male in Maldives, Phuket in Thailand and Colombo in Sri Lanka. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are waiting for the Haj rush to be over by January- end. We will add more destinations like Chennai-Johar Bahru where a lot of ethnic population lives and Mumbai-Kochi-Male,&quot; Air India Chairman V Thulasidas said. <br />
<br />
The low-cost airline, whose average fares are 70 per cent of the economy class fare of Air India, added several overseas destinations in 2006, including Doha, Bahrain and Singapore. The new Indian cities it has launched its services included Mangalore, Trichy and Amritsar. Air India Express also plans to start low-cost domestic flights but it would have to wait to acquire more aircraft. <br />
<br />
&quot;But anyway the situation would be reviewed after the Haj rush is over in January,&quot; Thulasidas said. <br />
<br />
Air India Express currently has a fleet of 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, of which seven are leased. All the aircraft have single class configuration to carry up to 189 passengers.</div></div><hr />

Kingfisher gets OK to fly abroad in 2008: Govt (http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Kingfisher-gets-OK-to-fly-abroad-in-2008-Govt/259549/)<br />
<br />
Kingfisher Airlines would be permitted to fly abroad this year as it would enjoy the rights of low-cost carrier Air Deccan, which it has taken over.<br />
<br />
�All three airlines -- Air India, Jet Airways and Kingfisher -- are going to fly abroad this year,� Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel said when asked about the fate of a request by the airline owned by liquor-baron Vijay Mallya to operate on international sectors.<br />
<br />
When asked if there would be a change in the prevailing norms to permit Indian carriers to become eligible for international operations, he said, �they (Kingfisher and Air Deccan) are one company now�.<br />
<br />
Air Deccan completes five years of domestic operations this August, thereby meeting the eligibility criteria required by the government to permit them to operate abroad. The low-cost carrier also satisfies the other criteria of having a 20 aircraft fleet.<br />
<br />
The Minister�s reply indicates the current norms are unlikely to be changed and that Kingfisher would be allowed to fly abroad only because it has acquired Air Deccan, and therefore its rights.<br />
<br />
The Kingfisher-Air Deccan combine has been a front-runner for being permitted to fly abroad as the low-cost carrier will be completing five years of domestic operations this August.<br />
<br />
Jet Airways is the only private airline that has so far been allowed to go global as it matched both the eligibility criteria. State-run Air India also flies on international routes.<br />
<br />
A Group of Ministers, which is studying the proposed Civil Aviation Policy, including these norms as well, is likely to meet soon to take a final call on the matter. It is understood that the continuation of the prevailing norms enjoys the majority view.</div></div><hr />

Mangalore Jan 9, 2008: As the saying goes, &quot;Rome wasn't built in a day&quot; yet the planning and preparation that went into its making was well worth the effort.  Similarly, the hustle and bustle of activity at the work site of Kenjar where the new Mangalore International Airport terminal is coming up, is a long drawn out and planned approach to what can only be termed as a state of the art facility for all incoming and outgoing passengers at Bajpe Airport.<br />
<br />
The new terminal is steadily shaping up near the Deccan Park which is located near Maravoor. The construction work is on in full swing under the multinational contractual construction company, CCCL. <br />

The Union government may consider selling shares in National Aviation Co. of India Ltd, or Nacil, which runs Air India, in an initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of 2008, even as the state-run firm prepares to select joint venture (JV) partners for a handful of related businesses in a bid to increase revenues<br />

&#8220;We may consider issuing an IPO in the second half of this year,&#8221; said Union aviation minister Praful Patel. He had said earlier that about 10-15% of the merged entity&#8217;s equity would likely be sold to enhance the carrier&#8217;s equity base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Officials indicated that a clearer picture on which airline was increasing frequency or adding new links would emerge by the end of the month. <br />
<br />
By<br />
Ashwini Phadnis , Business Line<br />
<br />
New Delhi, Jan 12 With new airports at Hyderabad and Bangalore slated to start operations within the next two months a host of domestic and international airlines have already planned additional flights and new connections to make use of the new facilities coming up there.<br />
<br />
The Executive Chairman, SpiceJet, Mr Siddhanta Sharma, told Business Line that his airline would be stationing a 189 seater Boeing 737-800 aircraft in Hyderabad when the new airport opens.<br />
<br />
�We will operate six additional daily flights from Hyderabad including a second daily flight to Delhi and offer a twice-a-day connection between Hyderabad and Vizag,� Mr Sharma said. <br />
<br />
The new airport in Hyderabad opens on March 16 while the Bangalore airport becomes operational at the end of March. <br />
<br />
The President IndiGo Airlines, Mr Bruce Ashby, said that with the proposed aircraft induction programme and in view of congestion at Delhi and Mumbai airports, the airline would look at adding more flights from the two southern cities.<br />
<br />
A spokesperson for GoAir said that in anticipation of the airport opening, the weekly departures from Bangalore had increased from 21 to 49 weekly commercial flights, while in Hyderabad, the weekly departures were up from 13 to 40 flights. <br />
<br />
The airline would look to further increase flights from both the cities in the coming days, the spokesman added.<br />
<br />
Officials of Air India and Jet Airways also indicated that with both airlines inducting more aircraft during the year an increase in frequency and connectivity to both cities was very much on the cards.<br />
<br />
Airline officials indicated that a clearer picture on which airline was increasing frequency or adding new connections from the two cities would emerge by the end of the month. <br />
<br />
�Airlines have to submit details of the flights they plan to operate during the eight-month summer season beginning March by the end of this month. In the case of Hyderabad alone, the airport would initially be able to handle 12 million passengers annually up from about 2-3 million being handled at present. This creates an opportunity for airlines,� an official said. <br />
<br />
Among the international airlines, British Airways has already announced that it would start a five-times-a-week flight between Hyderabad and London from October 28. <br />
<br />
�The launch of the Hyderabad flight allows passengers to travel not only to London but also catch the wave of connections to the US and other European destinations to which the airline flies,� said the airline Area Commercial Manager, Mr Gavin Halliday.<br />
<br />
During the year both Kingfisher Airlines and Air India plan to start flights from Bangalore to the West Coast of the United States. <br />
<br />
The Chairman and Managing Director, Air India, Mr V. Thulasidas, indicated that Air India plans a non-stop flight connecting Bangalore and San Francisco.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jet Airways is likely to get permission to begin its Mumbai-Shanghai-San Francisco daily flight with the Indian government clearing the proposal of China's Great Wall cargo airline to fly to Mumbai and Chennai. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am hopeful and optimistic that the proposal would be now cleared,&quot; Commerce and Industry Ministry Kamal Nath told journalists in the presence of Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal after the India-China Trade and Investment Summit at the China World Hotel. <br />
<br />
If this happens, Jet would become the first non-Chinese airline to use a Chinese hub as a transit to a third country. Jet had been keen to make Shanghai its hub for operations in the Asia-Pacific region just as it has made Brussels its European hub. <br />
<br />
Goyal told IANS that the airline hopes to start flights to Shanghai from New Delhi in the near future as well to take advantage of the growing traffic between the two countries.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1145422<br />
 <br />
The domestic airline market may have grown by over 30% last year, but market leader Jet Airways lost almost 10 percentage points to slips to 22.6%, the largest market share loss by any domestic carrier.<br />
<br />
In 2006, Jet carried 10.1 million passengers (31.2% market share) but this number fell to 9.7 million (22.6% market share) in 2007. <br />
<br />
Indian Airlines, JetLite and even Deccan lost ground during the period, but Jet�s decline was the steepest. Kingfisher Airlines was the only domestic full service carrier to gain last year; its share of the market reached double digits, from 8.7% to 12.2% last year.   <br />
<br />
Among other carriers, SpiceJet, Paramount Airways and GoAir � all saw market shares rise to 8.8% (6.%), 1.3% (0.7%) and 4.2% (2.8%) respectively. <br />
<br />
According to air traffic figures, domestic passenger traffic grew by 32.51% between January and December last year to 43.28 million (32.66 million in 2006).

UK TRADE AND INVESTMENT News Release (PN 7/2008) issued by The Government<br />
News Network on 15 January 2008<br />
A new report which for the first time spells out full details of every single<br />
major Indian transport project which British companies can invest in was<br />
launched by Trade and Investment Minister Lord Digby Jones in New Delhi,<br />
India today.<br />
<br />
The Minister launched the report in front of some 100 Indian companies<br />
involved in the Indian transport construction sector including DS Group,<br />
Larsen and Toubro, Gammon India Ltd and Punj Lloyd. UK companies present<br />
included Bombardier, Arup and Benoy. The report not only identifies the<br />
projects but also the barriers and incentives to win contracts.<br />
<br />
Lord Digby Jones said:<br />
<br />
&quot;This report shows incredible detail. It highlights that 116 airport x ray<br />
baggage inspection systems are to be purchased by 2008 and that there are<br />
currently plans to upgrade 16 train stations from New Delhi to Lucknow.<br />
<br />
&quot;But more importantly it highlights the route for entry. For example,<br />
100 per cent FDI is permissible for the development of all greenfield and<br />
brownfield airports and also that the entire road and highways network has<br />
been declared an industry allowed to commercially borrow. &quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the key findings of the UK Trade and Investment report show that:<br />
<br />
* �4.5bn of Government money is earmarked to upgrade 25 airports<br />
<br />
* India has the largest road network in the world aggregating 3.3 million km<br />
and �27bn of Government money is earmarked for roads and highways development<br />
<br />
* There are plans to implement 276 port projects valued at �6.3 billion.<br />
<br />
Lord Digby Jones added:<br />
<br />
&quot;UK companies must often partner with Indian companies to win contracts. This<br />
is why I am launching this report at a seminar where both UK and Indian<br />
companies can talk about potential partnerships.<br />
<br />
&quot;The partnership between the UK and India is growing fast. Bombardier supplies 340 metro cars to the Delhi metro, Pinsent Mason supply legal services for Delhi airport and Beckett Rankine did the masterplan for the new port of Krishnapatnam, north of Chennai.<br />
<br />
The Minister also used the opportunity to highlight British expertise in<br />
Public Private Partnerships which the Indian Government is interested in to<br />
help quickly build up the nation's infrastructure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Delhi and Mumbai international airports became India's first two PPP joint<br />
venture airports with estimated investment in both airports to be in excess<br />
of 1.9 billion pounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was delighted that Mott Macdonald developed the masterplan for the Delhi's<br />
new international airport which will ultimately have a capacity to handle<br />
100 million passengers every year.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over 70 countries have come to the UK seeking advice on PPP. For example,<br />
we have helped Singapore develop its PPP model, and it is now taking forward<br />
projects in education and sports infrastructure development.<br />
<br />
&quot;The UK is India's natural partner of choice as the Indian people enjoy the<br />
reality of a step change in infrastructure investment.&quot;</div></div><hr />

http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=3b1b8995-befc-48df-8b56-c357e0c98ee0&amp;&amp;Headline=Cabinet+clears+Kannur%2c+Nagpur+airports<br />
The Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the transfer of Ambedkar International Airport in Nagpur to a joint venture company for being developed into a multi-modal passenger and cargo hub, Information and Broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi said after the Cabinet meeting. <br />
<br />
The Cabinet also approved the setting up of a new airport at Kannur in Kerala through the public-private partnership.<br />
<br />
The decision to develop Nagpur into a multi-modal hub came after a Group of Ministers chose Nagpur because of its geographical location, as it is best suited for the purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a move that will encourage economic activity in Vidarbha region, the Union Cabinet today approved the transfer of the Nagpur airport to the JVC comprising Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) and the Airports Authority of India (AAI),&quot; Dasmunsi said.<br />
<br />
At present Airports Authority of India owns the airport and holds 49 per cent stake while the remaining stake will be held by MADC.<br />
<br />
The Cabinet also approved a new airport at Kerala in Kannur. The cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, gave an in-principle approval to a proposal of the Kerala Government to establish a new airport at Kannur.<br />
<br />
The new airport aims to boost tourism and economic activity in the state, Dasmunsi said. Sanction for land acquisition has already been granted for the airport, which will be built over an area of over 2,000 acres with single runway operations.<br />
<br />
The proposed airport would also act as a cargo hub for perishables like flowers, vegetables, fruits and seafood.<br />
<br />
The new airport will be commissioned at an estimated cost of Rs 930 crore, which excludes land acquisition cost, and the cost of resettlement and rehabilitation, which would be borne by the state, Dasmunsi said.<br />
<br />
A joint venture company would be set up between a private strategic partner with a 74 per cent equity and state government entity KINFRA, which would have 26 per cent.<br />
<br />
The state government would select the strategic partner through a competitive bidding process with guidance from the Centre.</div></div><hr />

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bangalore/Helihop_to_international_airport/articleshow/2709050.cms<br />
BANGALORE: For upper-income flyers, here&#8217;s some good news. Deccan Aviation will begin shuttle helicopter services from Bangalore city to the upcoming international airport at Devanahalli from March 30, the day the airport becomes operational. <br />
<br />
The shuttle service will operate from four prime locations that sport helipads or have the space to allow a helicopter to operate from. These are UB City, Palace Grounds, Infosys campus and Electronic City. <br />
<br />
Capt G R Gopinath, Deccan Aviation executive chairman, told The Times of India: &quot;Many like Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Nandan Nilekani and Mohandas Pai have been asking me to start a chopper shuttle service to reduce the commuting time for corporate passengers to and from the new airport. So we have finalized our plans to offer such services, which will begin on the day the new airport opens. The Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL) has granted us space to operate at the new airport.&quot; <br />
<br />
This service will, in effect, bring down the arduous commuting time of 2-3 hours from the airport to the city via road to just 10-15 minutes. <br />
<br />
Deccan will initially operate two helicopters &#8212; a seven-seater Bell helicopter and a five-seater Eurocopter. The frequency of the service is likely to be between half-an-hour and one hour. &quot;Depending on the response, we will add bigger choppers and increase the frequency,&quot; added Gopinath. <br />
<br />
Asked about the fare, he said: &quot;We are finalizing it. As this service will attract only first- and business-class passengers, fare will not be an issue.&quot;</div></div><hr />

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Air_India_seeks_compensation_from_Boeing/articleshow/2712071.cms<br />
NEW DELHI: Air India is seeking compensation from American aircraft maker Boeing for the delay in production of the new B-787 Dreamliner, for whose delivery the flag carrier might now have to wait till next year. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are in talks for compensation and Boeing is willing to compensate us,&quot; Air India CMD V Thulasidas said while replying to questions here today. <br />
<br />
While Air India has booked 27 of these aircraft, private carrier Jet Airways has placed orders for 10. Boeing has won orders for a total of 817 Dreamliners from 53 customers so far. <br />
<br />
The delivery schedule for the national carrier was to have begun later this year and is now being postponed to February next, while Jet's would start only in 2011.<br />
<br />
The Boeing Company, which is already six months behind schedule on its new 787 Dreamliner jet programme, is close to announcing additional delays of another three months.<br />
<br />
In a report on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal said, &quot;further delays would likely make it impossible for Boeing to meet its goal of delivering 109 airplanes by the end of 2009. If that occurs, the company could face millions of dollars in penalty payments to airlines that had been eager to get the planes as soon as possible.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Low cost carrier SpiceJet is mulling to order around 10 new Boeing 737- 800 Long-range over and above the already existing order of 30 it has in place.<br />
<br />
The low cost carrier SpiceJet hopes to break-even by March 2008, and is eyeing a fleet of 31 planes by 2011. SpiceJet swung to net profit in April-June quarter, but posted a net loss in the July-September quarter on account of the lean monsoon season.<br />
<br />
SpiceJet plans to have 24 planes by April 2008, and targets 31 planes by 2011. At present, the airline has a fleet of 18 aircraft, by adding a Boeing 737-900 extended range in December last year. This was the second Boeing 737-900 ER for the airline after one it received after one it operationalised in November 2007. <br />

<br />
As a warning to passengers that they cannot go scot-free after abusing the employees aboard the airplane, GoAir, a domestic low-cost carrier got an FIR registered against one of its passenger for allegedly molesting two of its female cabin crew members.<br />
�We wish to reiterate that GoAir has a zero tolerance policy towards passengers who misbehave with our employees,� says Freddy Castro, corporate communications official for GoAir. �Any passenger misbehaving, abusing or man-handling any of our employees will be dealt with strictly,� he says.<br />
On Thursday, January 17, two female crew members of GoAir Mumbai-Jaipur flight G8-111 alleged that they had been abused by a passenger, Ved Prakash, on board.<br />
<br />
After Prakash entered the flight, he touched the chest of a lady manager. Stunned, the manager asked one of her male colleagues to assist him. Prakash was escorted to his seat. But when another air-hostess approached him, he patted her bottom. After the ladies complained, he was removed from the flight and handed over to the Central Industrial Security Force.  :weird:His name - Ved (means Knowledge) Prakash (means Light), heck i dont see a connection there :ohno: :nuts:<br />

<br />
<br />
The country�s aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) plans to maximise utilisation of runways at major airports around the country. In fact, it plans to maximise the utilisation of the two runways at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, asserting that their simultaneous use has not affected flight operations from the national capital region. <br />
<br />
�With the increase in number of air traffic controllers, we are planning to increase the utilisation of runways and finally maximise it. There was no drop in flight-handling capacity due to the use of one runway for landing and one for take-off,� directorate general of civil aviation Kanu Gohain told ET. <br />
<br />
Earlier, when both the runways were simultaneously used, around 42 flights per hour were being handled and even now, the number remains more or less the same, after flagging off Jet Airways� maiden flight to Kuwait. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) traffic results for September 2007, demand in Asia-Pacific continued its brisk growth of recent months, rising 9.7% in September due to strong economic expansion in the region and fast-developing markets in China and India.</div></div><hr />

India's Jet Airways, the country's top private carrier, has approached unlisted British airline bmi majority shareholder and chairman Sir Michael Bishop about the sale of his stake, the Sunday Telegraph reported. <br />

Jet expressed its interest before Christmas in conjunction with a Middle-Eastern airline, believed to be Emirates, the report said, without naming its source. <br />

Jet Airways and American to Codeshare through JFK's T8<br />
<br />
http://www.aviation.com/business/071120-jet-airways-american-airlines-codeshare.html<br />
<br />
The airline is planning to expand its network to North America in the near future, added Aljunied. Jet Airways plans to begin serving San Francisco from Mumbai in February eastbound via Shanghai and has all the requisite government approvals; all that it still needs to begin the flights are the requisite slots at Shanghai, he said. <br />
<br />
In the future, Jet Airways also intends to serve Chicago and Washington, D.C. via Brussels, with Chicago being the first destination it will launch after San Francisco. Aljunied said the Chicago service may well originate at Bangalore, which &quot;will be the next destination in India&quot; to be added to the airline's North America-India network. <br />
<br />
Jet Airways might operate Airbus A330-200s to Chicago rather than its larger 777-300ERs, Aljunied added. Its 777-300ERs have eight first-class suites, 30 &quot;Premiere Class&quot; business-class seats and 274 economy-class seats; Jet Airways' A330-200s have 196 economy-class seats and 30 Premiere-class seats, but no first-class suites.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 The Government today has given &#8216;in principle&#8217; approval to the Government of Kerala (GoK) for setting up of a Greenfield International Airport through the PPP route at Kannur in relaxation of the Policy on Airport Infrastructure relating to Greenfield Airports.<br />
<br />
The proposed Kannur airport is located in Kannur district and falls outside the municipal limits of Kannur. The site is at about 80 km aerial distance from Calicut airport, about 229 km from Cochin airport and 125 km from the Mangalore airport.<br />
<br />
GoK has strongly recommended the project since this would promote tourism and trade in Northern Kerala. The proposed airport will also act as a cargo hub for perishable cargo like cut flowers, vegetables, fruits, sea food etc. Ministry of Tourism, GoI has also supported the setting up of the airport since it has potential to open up tourism for North Kerala, which has not seen sufficient tourism development.<br />
<br />
The salient features of the project are as follows:<br />
<br />
The airport will be built over 2000 acres of land and will have a single runway, sanction has been accorded for acquisition of the land.<br />
<br />
The project would be implemented through the Pubic Private Partnership (PPP) route with an estimated project cost of Rs. 929.5 crores, excluding costs pertaining to land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation which would be borne by the GoK.<br />
<br />
A Joint venture Company (JVC) between KINFRA, a GOK entity with 26% equity participation and a private strategic partner with 74% equity participation would be set up to implement the project. <br />

PPP MODEL - Private interest soars for new Kerala airport<br />
<br />
The grant of government approval for constructing an airport in north Kerala is attracting interest from infrastructure companies keen on participating in a project that will serve significant chunks of workers in West Asia hailing from the southern state and the nearly half a million foreign tourists visiting it every year.<br />
<br />
Leading conglomerates, including the Leela Group, Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd and GVK Infrastructure Ltd, are among those keen to build the international airport in Kerala's Kannur district, which was given a final approval by the Union government last week after nearly a decade since the project was proposed.<br />
<br />
The Kerala government says it expects to invite proposals within six months and targets completion in two years from then.<br />

India and Saudi Arabia have agreed to increase the number of seats that the designated airlines can offer between the two countries to 20,000 seats a week in each direction, up from 8,000 seats a week allowed previously.<br />
<br />
After the conclusion of air services bilateral talks between India and Saudi Arabia on Thursday, the two sides also agreed to increase the number of airlines that would be allowed to operate between the two countries.<br />
<br />
The new agreement allows the Saudi Airlines to operate to three new cities including Kozhikode, Lucknow and Bangalore. At the moment, Saudi Arabian airlines are allowed to operate to five cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi and Hyderabad.<br />
<br />
The two countries also decided to free all limitations on cargo services. An official statement issued on Thursday states that there will now be restrictions in terms of frequency and point of call for operating all cargo services.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Air India Cargo, the national carrier&#8217;s cargo unit, is looking to expand its network and reach to worldwide markets. <br />
<br />
Mr P.K. Gupta, Air India&#8217;s Executive Director Sales and Marketing (Cargo), told newspersons, &#8220;We have sent our survey teams to assess market potential to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka, New York, Chicago, Toronto, Los Angeles and London. We are also looking at Australia and Africa. The survey is likely to be complete by March 31, after which we would decide how to take it forward, but it is our long term plan.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Last year, Air India Cargo had a turnover of Rs 850 crore and is expecting Rs 1,000 crore this year, Mr Gupta said. <br />
<br />
Currently, Air India is operating one Boeing 737-200 aircraft for Department of Post and Telegraph between Kolkata, Guwahati, Imphal and Agartala in the North East; and has entered into a joint venture with Gati Ltd for operating freighter service with Nagpur being the hub. <br />
<br />
&#8220;We plan to operate five freighters B737-200 of which one has already commenced operation on the Delhi-Mumbai-Bangalore-Delhi route. With Nagpur being the hub, aircraft from Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai will discharge and exchange pallets there,&#8221; Mr Gupta added.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Jet Airways is likely to invest $8-10 million in its cargo airline as an initial sum once it finalises most formalities including a partner for its dedicated freighter airline by June 2008. The Chairman, Mr Naresh Goyal, has earlier indicated that Jet�s cargo airline should commence operations by end-2008.<br />
<br />
The investment would come in once the airline decides on the routes, Mr Jay B. Shelat, Vice-President Cargo, told Business Line on the sidelines of a two-day Air Cargo India conference organised by STAT Times, a transport and tourism journal. While converted aircraft from passenger to freighter seems a preferable mode, it would be open to leasing out new freighters too and then accordingly decide further investments, he said.<br />
<br />
The airline is studying various markets such as the US, Europe, West Asia and China for launching its cargo operations Mr Shelat said. <br />
<br />
While it sees opportunity for cargo activity on its shortly commencing Mumbai-Shanghai-San Francisco passenger route, the airline would just study the US market as of now, as not much cargo comes to India from there, he said.<br />
<br />
Mumbai-Hong Kong and Delhi-Hong Kong are other attractive routes for Jet. The company is upbeat about its cargo prospects, despite competition on these routes from Air India, which deploys a freighter Airbus 310 (converted from passenger aircraft) on the Hong Kong and Singapore routes.</div></div><hr />

Air India is joining hands with Airbus of France and Rajiv Chandrasekar�s Jupiter Aviation to set up a maintenance, repair, overhaul (MRO) facility in India to service all types of Airbus aircraft. A memorandum of understanding to this effect was signed here on Thursday. <br />
<br />
The national carrier would now prepare a business plan for the MRO and submit it to its board. The plan would be ready in two months. <br />
<br />
The proposed business plan would outline the broad contours of the proposed MRO joint venture. Equity stake for the partners, location of the proposed MRO, investment details and other plans would be part of the business plan. <br />
<br />
�We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a Airbus subsidiary. As per the MoU, we would make a business plan within two months,� an Air India spokesperson said. It is understood that the MoU was inked by the national carrier�s chief V Thulasidas in the presence of the visiting French delegation headed by president Nicolas Sarkozy. <br />
<br />
It is understood that Air India will set up the JV in partnership with a subsidiary of Airbus, which is an EADS company. Jupiter and EADS have already set up a special purpose vehicle for this purpose.</div></div><hr />

It will likely introduce non-stop flights from Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi to New York as well as a Chennai-San Francisco service by September or October. <br />
<br />
Jet Airways and Air India enjoyed considerable success in their New York sectors last year: Jet�s load factors were close to the 90 per cent mark and Air India�s, at 80-85 per cent.<br />
<br />
Some 13.7 lakh passengers are expected to travel from India to the U.S. next year. India�s airlines are seemingly confident that this traffic will be enough to satisfy their margins, at least in light of the number of routes that will be introduced in the coming months.<br />
<br />
Jet Airways will also introduce a flight from Bangalore to San Francisco towards late February, but this will be through Shanghai. Jet and Air India are forming their long-haul strategies around hubs � Brussels for Jet and probably Munich or Vienna for Air India. <br />

This airport if built will come up next to Reliance Industries's 5000 hectare SEZ. The latest news is that AAI is going to conduct a feasibility study soon.<br />
<br />

Jan 8: Haryana wants an international airport too (http://in.news.yahoo.com/hindustantimes/20080108/r_t_ht_nl_features/tnl-haryana-wants-an-international-airpo-6b6720b.html)<br />
<br />
The Haryana Government does not want to be seen lagging behind Noida in any respect. It has decided to stake fresh claim with the Centre for an international airport and cargo area in Jhajjar near Gurgaon that, it says, would complement the special economic zone of Reliance Industries.<br />
<br />
Under the Airport Infrastructure Policy of 1997, an additional airport within an aerial radius of 150km of an existing airport is not permitted. But since this rule has been waived for Greater Noida, one of the NCR areas of Haryana too should be considered, principal secretary to the Haryana Government ML Tayal told the Hindustan Times.<br />
<br />
The Haryana Government that struck an agreement with Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) last year for setting up a SEZ or special economic zone in Gurgaon-Jhajjar had moved the Centre, seeking a Greenfield Airport-cum-Cargo Air Complex in Jhajjar. The proposed SEZ has provision for a cargo airport and a 2,000MW power plant in Jhajjar.<br />
<br />
Tayal said since the Centre had approved an international airport in Greater Noida, it should do the same for Haryana as well. &quot;We had moved the Centre even before Uttar Pradesh for an international airport in Jhajjar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jan 22: AAI to conduct feasibility study at Jhajhar in Haryana for development of Greenfield airport (http://www.travelbizmonitor.com/articleDetails.aspx?id=2049&amp;sectionid=36&amp;name=Top%20Stories)<br />
<br />
Following Haryana Government's request, officials from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are slated to visit Jhajhar district in the state to conduct a feasibility report for the development of a Greenfield airport in the region. At present, the state doesn't have an airport. The closest ones are the Indira Gandhi International Airport at Gurgaon and Chandigarh Airport.<br />
<br />
Commenting on the development, Dr G Prasanna Kumar, IAS, Financial Commissioner &amp; Principal Secretary, Transport &amp; Civil Aviation Departments, Haryana, said, &quot;Jhajhar has an old airstrip, which was used during World War II. Though the land is not with us, we can acquire it. We have requested the AAI to conduct a feasibility study to see whether we can develop an airport at Jhajhar. The AAI officials are expected to visit the site shortly,&quot; said Kumar. <br />
<br />
Most probably this airport will not take off for atleast another 5 years as it's just too close to the IGI airport which will have a capacity to handle 100 million passengers/annum by 2026.</div></div><hr />

The airline currently has a fleet of five aircraft and will be acquiring six to eight 50-seater Bombardier or ATR aircraft by end of 2008. �Of the eight aircraft that we will be acquiring, two will be on lease and purchase options,� Jagson Airlines chairman Jagdish P Gupta told. Two aircraft are likely to be delivered in three months� time. <br />
<br />
Talking about the positioning of the regional carrier, Mr Gupta said: �The regional carrier will be positioned as a �value carrier� (in-between low-cost and full service) flying to non-metro cities in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.� The airline has landing rights at 40 airports</div></div><hr />

<br />
Notification On Land Acquisition Next Week<br />
<br />
Chandigarh: The international terminal for the Chandigarh airport, to be built in Mohali, would have an integrated terminal building to cater to 700 passengers and four passenger-boarding aero bridges. This has been conveyed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to the state government in their latest communique, after the MOU was signed between AAI, Punjab and the surprise entry, Haryana.<br />
<br />
    With AAI conveying the details of the projects, the Punjab government would be issuing notice for land acquisition for nearly 304 acres next week, sources said.<br />
<br />
    Among others, the project would require construction of apron for parking 3 in-contact and 8 remote parking stands for wide-bodied jet aircraft. Three link taxiways and a parallel taxi track are also on the anvil, &#8220;which would enable the airport to accommodate one flight every three minutes,&#8221; senior officials told TOI. With this kind of augmentation, the airport would be able to handle 80-85 flights every day including transport flights of air force.<br />
    <br />
The international terminal would be provided approach roads on two sides &#8212; one from Mohali and the other from Patiala. The project would also include construction of cargo complex and hangars for flying club activities. &#8216;&#8216;The plan envisages cityside development covering 190 acres of land and airside development covering 110 acres of land. Approximately 168 acres of additional land is required from Chandigarh for runway extension and other structures. This would exclude 90 acres of airforce land,&#8217;&#8217; officials said.<br />

Essentially, the bottleneck comes to the security checkpoint, and to a smaller extent, the check-in counters. For the terminal to handle x patients/hour, the security checkpoints should have the same or higher capacity, with some buffer to spare. I hope they work this out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
. Air travel in the country could become faster, and possibly cheaper, as the civil aviation ministry is working with the defence ministry to identify ways for civilian aircraft to fly over the country&#8217;s restricted airspace. According to sources, the aviation ministry has already initiated a pilot project in south India called the Chennai Flights Information Region (FIR), for the purpose. And once the project works out successfully, the ministry plans to extend it to the other four flight information regions as well.<br />
    &#8220;The civil aviation and defence ministries are working on ways to jointly manage airspace in the country. We have already initiated a pilot project in south India called the Chennai Flights Information Region. Once complete, we can fly civilian aircraft at higher altitudes,&#8221; Ashok Chawla, secretary, civil aviation ministry, told ET.<br />
    Currently, the defence ministry and the Indian Air Force (IAF) control more than 50% of India&#8217;s airspace. But the IAF has been strongly opposing the move to allow civilian aircraft into its space. The civil aviation ministry, however, has been pitching for freeing more airspace for smoother movement of civilian aircraft.<br />
    According to sources, the draft civil aviation policy had clearly stated that the Airport Authority of India would take care of the civilian air space and the defence ministry would control the restricted airspace. However, the security and control of restricted airspace would still be retained by the defence ministry and IAF.<br />
    Earlier, major differences had emerged between IAF and the civil aviation ministry on the proposed civil aviation policy. IAF had publicly expressed its displeasure at not being consulted at the drafting stage of the policy.<br />
    The defence ministry had also raised several objections to the proposed civil aviation policy, including a move to release more airspace meant exclusively for IAF. But the civil aviation ministry had said the policy should be converted to a &#8220;national aviation policy&#8221; rather than be restricted only to the civil aviation sector.<br />

http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080124/jsp/business/story_8820149.jsp<br />
<br />
Davos, Jan. 23: Air India will set up a hub at Munich within a year to provide integrated connectivity in the European region and neighbouring countries, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said today. It may take around a year to begin the operations. Air India will take help from German airline Lufthansa, a member of Star Alliance, a global network of airlines. Patel said Jet Airways has decided to make Brussels its European hub.<br />

As part of its ongoing expansions, the Air India is planning to set up a hub in Europe.<br />
<br />
�The hub is being planned at Munich airport in Germany and airport authorities have already offered the space. The plan is to fly about ten flights to the hub from various Indian airports daily evening. <br />
<br />
Connection flights will be operated to various European and American destinations from the hub,� said Air India Chairman and Managing Director V Thulasidas in an interview with this website�s newspaper.<br />
<br />
�One of the daily flights to the hub would be from an airport in Kerala. The name of the airport would not be disclosed at this point of time, �he said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Air India, the brand under which the National Aviation Company of India Ltd (NACIL) flies, will set up an operational base in Thiruvananthapuram. <br />
<br />
This means that Air India flights out of Kerala can originate from the city and crew will be stationed here as well, said Mr V. Thulasidas the Chairman and Managing Director of NACIL which was formed by the merger of Air India and Indian. <br />
<br />
The operational base will be in addition to Air India�s planned maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in the city, he added. <br />
<br />
In fact, part of the space meant for the MRO will be used for the operational base. <br />
<br />
The airline decided to set up an MRO facility in Thiruvananthapuram only because the State Government offered it free land, he explained. <br />
<br />
The airline is ready to start work on setting up the MRO facility as soon as the site is handed over to it, he added. <br />
<br />
According to Mr Thulasidas, once work on the MRO facility starts, it will take about 12 months to complete. <br />
<br />
The proposed MRO facility will be operated in association with Boeing and will service Boeing 737-800 aircraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aviation to credit: UPA opens many FDI windows (http://www.indianexpress.com/story/267270.html)<br />
<br />
 �In some sectors, we have introduced FDI norms because none existed before, while in others, we have rationalised and refined existing policies that were too broadly defined,� said a senior official from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). For instance, the cap of 49 per cent in the civil aviation sector applied to all air transport services. Now, the domestic passenger business retains the 49 per cent cap, but the rules have been eased for other air services � maintenance, repair and overhaul organisations (MROs), cargo airlines and helicopter services.<br />
<br />
�Boeing and Airbus have been keen to set up MROs for a while and are expected to move forward with their plans immediately. We expect significant investments in other air transport services as well,� the official said.<br />
<br />
In another decision related to the aviation sector, the FDI policy on titanium production has been liberalised. Until now, 74 per cent FDI was allowed only in the value addition of titanium production from iluminite ore. Now, mining for titanium-yielding ore like iluminite, abundantly available in India, as well as titanium production has been thrown open for 100 per cent FDI. <br />
<br />
While there have been no formal applications for this business yet, major investments can be expected from global aircraft majors soon. While large amounts of titanium are used in aircraft manufacturing, companies like Boeing and Airbus are FDI gates opened expected to make investments in order to fulfill their counter-trade obligations, which require them to offset part of their earnings from aircraft sales to Indian national airlines by investing in India.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Air India and Jet Airways will soon be permitted to fly passengers from India to Oman and Bahrain via Abu Dhabi, Dubai or Sharjah. The move was the outcome of the air services agreement between India and Oman which concluded here on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
The agreement with Oman also allows Indian carriers to operate flights to Europe and North America through Oman, Bahrain, Dubai, Sharjah or Abu Dhabi. The agreement has increased the weekly seats that airlines of Bahrain can operate to 11,500 but has put a cap of 14 weekly flights offering 2,156 weekly seats to Mumbai. <br />
<br />
In addition, the agreement allows airlines to operate a daily flight to Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi offering 1,078 seats a week to each city. The airlines can also operate six times a week to Bangalore. Addressing a press conference, the President and Chief Executive, Gulf Air, Mr Bjorn Naf, said that with the successful conclusion of the bilateral talks, the airline would soon start operating a daily flight between Bahrain and Hyderabad.

Uttarakhand plans its own airline<br />
<br />
To overcome the long and arduous distances in the hills and boost connectivity, the Uttarakhand government has chalked out a plan to start its own airline.  <br />
  <br />
For this purpose, the government has roped in the Uttarakhand Infrastructure Project Company (UIPC) Pvt Ltd which would buy at least two planes for the proposed airline.  <br />
  <br />
A total of Rs 34 crore is being estimated for running the airline with the government already sanctioning an outlay of Rs 14 crore. The rest of the amount would be contributed by Infrastructure Leasing and Finance Services (IL&amp;FS), a joint partner with the government in the UIPC. �We are ready to invest Rs 14 crore in this project,� confirmed Civil Aviation Secretary PC Sharma.  <br />
  <br />
For the time being, the government is mulling two options � capital model and revenue model. Either the UIPC buys the planes and hypothecates them in the name of the government, or the government would compensate the initial losses suffered by the company for running the airline.  <br />
  <br />
There is the third option � the government may rope in the Nepal-based Buddha Airlines. This airline would be asked to operate the two planes in Uttarakhand. �Our plan is to buy two small planes for the mountain airline,� said Sharma.  <br />

San Francisco: With Indian carriers battling for their share of leisure and business travellers bound for California this summer, San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is keen to welcome its new clients from India. <br />
<br />
To add some gleam to this new found gold rush, the City of San Francisco and India's IT capital Bangalore are also preparing for a &quot;sister city&quot; relationship soon, Kandace Bender, SFO's deputy airport director said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Out of California's 315,000-plus Asian Indians, over half live in its northern region, with the greatest concentration in the vicinity of Silicon Valley that is located within a 30-minute drive from SFO,&quot; Bender told IANS. <br />
<br />
In addition, some 25,000 Asian Indians live in the nearby Sacramento, Yolo, San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties, all within a 90-minute drive from the airport, as per statistics available with US agencies. <br />
<br />
To tap this potential, the state-run carrier Air India, Vijay Mallya-controlled Kingfisher Airlines, Naresh Goyal-promoted Jet Airways and a start-up US airline Sapphire Airways are keen to introduce flights to and from San Francisco. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our desire is to get flights there at the earliest,&quot; said Air India executive director communications Jitender Bhargava, speaking about his airline's plans for the India-California sector. <br />
<br />
&quot;We want a non-stop link between the silicon valley of India, Bangalore, and the Silicon Valley of the US in San Francisco Bay Area,&quot; Bhargava told IANS, even as the carrier announced a non-stop flight from Delhi to New York from Feb 8. <br />
<br />
Bender said the specific dates of commencement of service in 2008 were still to be finalised but said Air India was planning three non-stop flights a week to San Francisco from Bangalore on Boeing 777 aircraft. <br />
<br />
Similarly, she added, Jet Airways was planning a daily service from Mumbai to San Francisco via Shanghai, also on a Boeing 777, while Kingfisher was looking at a non-stop service with an Airbus-340-500SE. <br />
<br />
In fact, Shanghai already shares a sister city relationship with San Francisco and a similar pact with Bangalore is being seen as a platform to improve trade, technological, cultural and educational opportunities between the two cities. <br />
<br />
Already, Jet Airways has shifted its regional headquarters from New York to San Francisco to face the competition it expected from Kingfisher Airlines when it flies direct to San Francisco from August 2008. <br />
<br />
The carrier is launching a flight from Delhi to the US West Coast in February, six months ahead of Kingfisher Airlines. A Jet Airways senior official told IANS the airline was &quot;preparing its flight operations schedule by moving office&quot;. <br />
<br />
In addition to holiday travel, business links between India and San Francisco are immense. &quot;Of the 40 Bay Area firms with facilities in India, 13 are within 50 km of Delhi and nine within 50 km of Mumbai,&quot; said Bender. <br />
<br />

<br />
Accordingly, carriers flying between San Francisco and India will also benefit from the potential offered by cargo traffic. California is the top US state for air exports, valued at $560 million in 2003, she added. <br />
<br />
&quot;San Francisco also leads in high-technology trade by air with India. The San Francisco Customs District reports the highest proportion of such trade by air among all US customs districts.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
New Bengal airport aims at A320 traffic<br />
<br />
Kolkata, Feb 5 With the premium travel segment growing by 12% in the eastern region, Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd (BAPL) plans to build the Durgapur-Asansol airport with the 179-seater Airbus A320 in mind. <br />
<br />
The Aerotropolis, which has attracted an expression of interest from Singapore�s Changi Airport Authority, will have a 3.2 km runway. However, it will begin with a runway of 1.8 km, enough for smaller passenger aircraft like the 71-seater ATR. <br />
<br />
The Rs 10,000-crore project will have an airport along with hotels over around 2,300 acre, and is aiming for the International Civil Aviation Organisation�s 4C classification. <br />
<br />
Raj Shekhar Agrawal, director of Bengal Aerotropolis, said, �We are looking at the 4C classification of the ICAO.� <br />
<br />
The long-distance premium travel potential for the region in 2006-07 was around 4.02 lakh passengers annually, of which 1.84 lakh passengers are expected to use air travel. <br />
<br />
According to a recent study done by BAPL, the premium travel potential of the region is expected to grow to 5.64 lakh passengers annually in 2010-11 from 4.65 lakh at present. The new airport expects nearly 4 lakh passengers while it gets ready by 2010-11. <br />
<br />
While the air travel in the eastern region has grown by 15-20% since the advent of low-cost carriers since 2003-04, the air-travel density in the region is expected to touch 0.20, even higher than airports in neighbouring states like Raipur in Chhattisgarh and Ranchi in Jharkhand. <br />
<br />
While passenger traffic is expected to drive revenues, BAPL is also keen on non-aeronautical revenue. �In some airports the non-aeronautical revenues are as high as 65%,� said Agrawal.</div></div><hr />

http://www.business-standard.com/common/storypage_c_online.php?leftnm=10&amp;bKeyFlag=IN&amp;autono=33430<br />
The Boeing Company, the world&#8217;s leading aerospace company and the largest manufacturer of commercial jetliners and military aircraft combined, has entered into an agreement with India&#8217;s TAL Manufacturing Solutions, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Motors, for the manufacturing of structural components for Boeing&#8217;s 787 Dreamliner airplane programme.<br />
<br />
Under the agreement, TAL Manufacturing Solutions will build floor beams for the 787 using new technology with advanced titanium and composite materials. These floor beams will be used on the 787 Dreamliner and provide for a best-value solution and significant weight savings.<br />
<br />
Carolyn Corvi, vice president and general manager, Airplane Programmes, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: &quot;Boeing is proud to welcome Tata into its family of world-class aerospace suppliers and we are confident that this partnership will help Boeing and Tata leverage mutual best-value capabilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8220;This partnership between Boeing and Tata will further increase the value of the 787 to our customers, helping make it the world&#8217;s leading commercial airplane,&quot; Corvi said.<br />
<br />
The floor beams for the 787 airplane will be produced at TAL&#8217;s new facility in Nagpur, India, and then transported to Boeing partners in Japan, Italy and the United States for further assembly. <br />
<br />
Ravi Kant, chairman, TAL, and managing director, Tata Motors : &quot;The production of Boeing&#8217;s structural components by TAL indicates technical and manufacturing excellence within the Group. We believe that this agreement has the potential to develop into a more broad-based alliance that would enable both organizations to utilize the best and most competitive resources within themselves and thereby offer greater value to customers.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Atam P Arya, managing director, TAL, said: &quot;TAL already has an established reputation in the state-of-the-art precision engineering. The agreement with Boeing allows us to open yet another frontier. This would be a turning point for the Indian manufacturing industry to gain a footprint in the global aerospace business.&#8221;<br />

<br />
I just travelled to the US by Jet Airways and I can say that it has redefined the image of an Indian airliner. In terms of customer service, food and in flight entertainment and the overall quality of the product that they are offering, I think it is almost impossible for Air India to beat it. Kingfisher may be able to give it a tough fight though on the Indo US sector.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Air travellers from Tiruchi, Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram and Coimbatore would soon be able to check-in from any counter at these airports rather than having to go to an airline-specific check-in counter.<br />
<br />
This follows Thursday&#8217;s announcement that SITA, along with Airports Authority of India (AAI), would rollout the AirportConnect Open facility that allows Common User Terminal Equipment (CUTE) use at 13 non-metro airports including the four airports in South India. <br />
<br />
The 13 airports are expected to record a passenger traffic growth of 37 per cent over the next five years. <br />
<br />
Application <br />
<br />
<br />
AirportConnect CUTE is a common software, hardware and network airport solution that enables airlines and handling agents to access their own application from workstations and printers shared by all users.<br />
<br />
Addressing a press conference, SITA Chief Executive Officer, Mr Francesco Violante, said that the deployment of AirportConnect to 13 airports will make them more attractive for airlines as it streamlines the process of passenger management as the market grows.<br />
<br />
&#8220;In the next 10 months the facility will be available at 13 non-metro airports including those in South India,&#8221; said Director-Sales, South Asia, Mr Maneesh Jaikrishna.<br />
<br />
The CUTE facility is already available at 10 airports including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Kochi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14602057<br />
<br />
Air India launched its non-stop flight from New Delhi to New York that will cut down travel time between the two cities by at least three hours, company officials said.  <br />
<br />
Flight AI-101 left the Indira Gandhi International Airport for JFK Airport, New York, at 12.30 a.m. Air India officials said while the onward journey would take 16 hours, it would take 18 hours on return. <br />
<br />
The state-of-the-art Boeing 777-200LR aircraft will arrive in New York at 5.45 a.m. local time. The flight will depart from the JFK International Airport at 4.00 p.m. local time and arrive next day in New Delhi at 4.30 p.m.<br />
<br />
The 4:30 PM arrival time in Delhi is a good move. This will allow passengers ample time to catch the late evening connecting domestic flights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wings</div><div class="date">February 8th, 2008, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I am correct,<br />
Departure : 4:00pm local (Eastern Time) = 2:30am (IST)<br />

<br />
.........In agreement with the 45 airlines based at the airport, SITA will deploy its AirportConnect Open technology across 150 check-in counters at the airport and 50 CUSS (common-use self-service) check-in kiosks which will include 20 located in prominent Mumbai hotels.

<br />
This would, however, materialize only after completion of the works in the new terminal building by the airport authorities.<br />
<br />
The airport that had been upgraded to international standards deserved the facility. The department is also willing to provide the required infrastructure and staff to the new cargo terminal project.<br />
<br />
The airport is receiving international flights and there is urgent need of a cargo terminal. The facility would enhance the revenue of the airport.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Hindu<br />
<br />
MANGALORE, Jan 29: Even as the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has added new infrastructure facilities at Bajpe (Mangalore) airport during the last three years, the customers have ranked this airport high in providing services. <br />
<br />
As per a customer satisfaction survey of airports by an agency for the AAI, Mangalore Airport has scored the highest ranking in the customer satisfaction index among domestic airports in South India. <br />
<br />
The survey covered different aspects of an airport. It included attitude of AAI employees, the police and other security personnel, cleanliness at the airport and general aesthetics, drinking water facilities, guidance signage, flight information system, audio system and quality of trolley services. It also studied other facilities such as car parking, ATM service, post office, illumination, bookstall and other working conditions at the airport.<br />
<br />
The survey by the Delhi-based Spectrum Planning (India) Ltd. has said that the customer satisfaction index of Mangalore airport had gone up from 75 per cent to 81 per cent between early 2007 and late 2007.<br />
<br />
The first round of survey was conducted between February and April 2007 and the second between August and October.<br />
<br />
Among the domestic airports of AAI in South India, Mangalore airport has scored the highest customer satisfaction index, M.R. Vasudeva, director of Mangalore airport, told The Hindu. <br />
<br />
The agency interviewed 653 customers during the survey. Of them, 284 people were departing passengers and 234 arriving. <br />
<br />
As many as 110 visitors to the airport, 11 concessionaries such as shopkeepers and employees of restaurants at the airport, personnel of seven aircraft operators and seven regulatory authorities were also interviewed.<br />
<br />
Facilities <br />
<br />
<br />
The AAI had built a new air-conditioned arrival hall and extended its departure hall to handle at least 250 passengers at a time at both the halls, last year. Introduction of round-the-clock air traffic services for over flying aircraft, setting up of category I Instrument Landing System (ILS) facility, laying a concrete runway (second one) in addition to the bituminous old run way, opening the airport for flight services to West Asia, converting the airport to a profit earning entity, and introduction exchange facility (by a private agency) are some of the major developments at the airport in the last three years. Aircraft operators introduced new flight services to Mumbai and Bangalore, including a late evening flight to Bangalore. <br />
<br />
New flight services began to Goa, Kochi and Kozhikode.</div></div><hr />

NEW DELHI: Bangalore will soon have a world-class flying training institute for helicopter pilots as aerospace major Hindustan Aeronautics Limited has entered into a joint venture project with a Canadian company to set up a 'helicopter simulation park' there. <br />
<br />
HAL Chairman and Managing Director Ashok Baweja said the facility will be developed jointly by HAL and Canada-based aviation firm CAE on equal partnership basis at an initial investment of Rs 240 crore to provide complete range of solution on helicopter training. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are setting up a helicopter simulator park in Bangalore to offer complete solution on helicopter training,&quot; HAL Chairman and Managing Director Ashok Baweja said. He said HAL is taking up the project as an industry. <br />
<br />
The park, which is being developed on five acres of land, will provide flying training basically on Advanced Light Helicopter Dhruv. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are introducing Dhruv. So we will have to train pilots. It is a new machine. Pilots have not flown Dhruv before. They are flying other types. So that (the facility) will provide them opportunity to get training on Dhruv,&quot; he said. He said the pilots will be initially trained on a &quot;universal simulator.&quot; <br />
<br />
With the help of simulators, pilots can experience different kinds of effects while sitting inside an artificial cockpit and can go in for various manoeuvres and combat profiles while staying on the ground. <br />
<br />
Indigenously designed and developed by HAL, Dhruv, is a twin-engine new generation helicopter in the 4.5-5.5-tonne weight class. It is a multi-role, multi-mission helicopter capable of a wide range of military and civilian applications.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realy believe this is just too early to gauge Bajpe airport. this is still a small terminal and air traffic is just growing......I hope AAI is keeping future in mind in developing the new integrated terminal. Mangalore is surely growing BIG time.Otherwise it will be back to square again for AAI.</div></div><hr />

New York: Air India expects to increase manifold its earnings from the India-US sector, which will see the addition of more new direct services by the flag carrier. <br />
<br />
�As the India-US sector is the highest revenue earning sector for us with the enormous growth potential, it will continue to be Air India\'s major thrust area for growth in the coming years,� the airline�s Executive Director Jitender Bhargava said. The revenue earned from the India-US sector in 2005-06 was almost Rs 2,616 crore and we expect to earn a revenue of over Rs 3,300 crore in the current year. Next year, this will be much higher,� he said. <br />
<br />
The airline also plans to introduce non-stop flights between Bangalore to San Francisco later this year, connecting the Silicon Valleys of either countries, when the sixth Boeing 777-300 (Extended Range) aircraft is inducted. <br />
<br />
The airline also plans to commence flights to Washington and Texas, that is either Houston or Dallas, amongst other cities in the US. However, these services would be operated with an intermediate halt at a European destination, Bhargava said. He was speaking to reporters from India who flew in on Air India\'s first non-stop Delhi-New York flight over the North Pole, covering the distance in just a little over 15 hours.</div></div><hr />
