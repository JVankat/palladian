<P>
Revised 5.2.1995.
<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>
Most researchers are well aware of the drawbacks of the current
scientific publishing process. The time lag between the initial
submission of an article and its final publication in printed
form is seldom less than one year and can exceed two years. The
discussion which follows a paper (&quot;discussion open until
...&quot;) may lag the paper itself by half a year, if any such
discussion takes place at all. There are also additional obstacles
on the route to the final &quot;consumers&quot; of the product.
The relatively low number of specialists world-wide who are interested
in a narrow research domain leads to a low circulation of the
journals in question, which in turn raises the subscription prices.
High subscription prices again lead to a lower number of subscribers,
creating a vicious circle. The December 1994 issue of Scientific
American reports for instance that in the past 8 years journal
expenditures nearly doubled while the actual number of journals
subscribed to declined by some 10%.
<P>
Subscription alone doesn't guarantee that the journals reach their
intended readership. Researchers working in large research organisations
may receive journal issues only after these have &quot;toured&quot;
for months (in some cases even over a year) within the organisation's
internal mail system.
<P>
Nevertheless the research community needs scientific refereed
journals. The information contained in the refereed scientific
journals of some domain, seen as a whole, represents the state-of-the-art
in that domain better than any other means. Often it takes several
years before that knowledge is consolidated and migrates to the
basic textbooks of the domain. In areas such as IT in construction
basic textbooks of high quality are in fact almost totally missing.
<P>
In an era where just about anything can pass as a conference paper
the refereed journal paper still represents an original contribution
which has undergone some measure of quality control. For many
younger scientists getting their work published in refereed journals
is extremely important, in particular as a means of building up
an academic track record.
<P>
All this points to a situation where some fundamental re-engineering
of the scientific publishing process is urgently needed. The publishing
process needs to be speeded up considerably, especially in research
domains where developments are rapid (ie. information technology).
Fortunately recent developments in network technology and infrastructure
provide tools which are essential for such a reengineering effort.
<P>
Commercial publishers of scientific journals have started to look
at how they could use IT to their advantage. They are however
burdened by commercial considerations which may unduly restrict
the solutions they come up with. For this reason they are currently
starting to market solutions such as including the contents of
numerous journals on CD-ROM:s or offering on-line services with
advanced search capabilities including abstracts of articles.
In one case the abstracts are put into the service before the
article has even been published. They are, however, understandably
reluctant to make the articles themselves available in services
such as World Wide Web, due to the difficulties in collecting
revenues for such a service.
<P>
The project plan presented in this paper is the outcome of a small
reengineering exercise. The major questions asked were how we
could, given the current state of electronic publishing technology;
<UL>
<LI>Minimise the average time between the submission of a scientific
article and the time when a researcher for whom the information
is relevant gets access to it.
</UL>

<P>
In the ideal case of a submitted article needing no correction
the time from submission to the finished article becoming available
could be as short as one month. Also in the case of submissions
needing editing the overall process could be shortened considerably.
The technical editing time (putting an article on the Web) could
be shortened to a few days, compared with the several months required
for type setting, proof correction and waiting in line for the
first journal issue with empty space.
<UL>
<LI>Disseminate the article as efficiently as possible to anybody
having an interest in it.
</UL>

<P>
The journal could in fact provide a virtual meeting place of professionals
(readers and writers) interested in the topics of the proposed
journal.
<H2>2. Survey of existing paper journals dealing with construction
IT</H2>

<P>
At least the following scientific journals are specialised in
information technology in construction.
<UL>
<LI>Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering (American Society
of Civil Engineers, ASCE)
<LI>Automation in Construction, Elsevier
<LI>Microcomputers in Civil Engineering, Blackwell
<LI>International Journal of Construction Information Technology,
Salford University
<LI>Other closely related journals are:
<LI>Engineering with Computers, Springer
<LI>Computer-Aided Design, Butterworth-Heinemann
<LI>Building and Environment, Pergamon Press .
<LI>International Journal of Design Sciences and Technology, Hermes
</UL>

<P>
The circulation of these journals varies. The ASCE journal has
a subscription base of some 1500-2000 and prints over 3000 copies.
Computer-aided design has a large reader base, because of its
multi-disciplinary nature. Automation in construction was originally
targeted for at least 500 subscribers, to break even. The number
of subscribers to some of the other journals is as low as a few
hundreds.
<P>
A number of periodic international conferences publish proceedings
dealing with IT in construction, for instance CIB W-78 annual
workshop, CAAD Futures, ISARC, the ASCE congress on construction
computing. Often the editors of the above refereed journals solicit
papers very actively from researchers who present papers at these
conferences.
<P>
The quality of the articles published in the above journals varies
a lot. One practice which is somewhat questionable is for a journal
to publish conference papers almost unchanged. The details of
the review procedures and the statistics of the journal (proportion
of accepted papers/submitted papers, mean time from submission
to printing) are often not known even by the members of the editorial
board. To a large extent the responsibility lies with the main
editor of a journal.
<H2>3. Examples of electronic publishing</H2>

<P>
Electronic publishing uses electronic media to distribute information
that would otherwise be printed on paper. &quot;Publications&quot;
<P>
differ in modes of distribution and presentation formats.
<P>
<B>Just-in-time</B> distribution provides information only on
request - when searched for and requested by the end user. Examples
of this kind of publications include existing electronic journals,
full text bibliographies, databases, on-line conference proceedings
and other on-line publishing efforts like Project Gutenberg, Britannica-on
line. Computer networks and applications like FTP, Gopher or WWW
are used for the physical data transfer. Since the bandwidth for
the just-in-time distribution is limited, only timely or not very
voluminous information is currently distributed in that way.
<P>
<B>Just-in-case </B>distribution generally uses the same channels
as traditional publications (mail) but instead of paper employs
digital media to store the information. This information is shelved
and will be used if and when required. The most popular media
for full-text publications are CD-ROM:s which can hold about the
same amount of text as 200 Bibles. In particular reference information
(Encyclopaedias), databases like (ICONDA or CD-REEF) and full
text excerpts from selected computer magazines are published in
this way - some on a subscription basis.
<P>
Finally <B>once-in-time</B> distribution broadcasts information
that is lost soon after it was made available. Examples are non
archived e-mail exploders, US Net News etc. Information that should
be distributed in that way are very timely messages and pointers
to new resources available through the previous two channels.
<P>
Electronic publications take many different formats, from simple
ASCII text to multimedia including HiFi sound and full motion
video. Formats may be proprietary - that is information in that
format may only be accessed using particular commercial software.
In that case the information is usually tightly bound with the
presenting application. Alternatively the format can be in some
way standardised so that the information may be extracted by many
different, perhaps even free software tools.
<P>
Existing electronic journals distributed on the WWW include:
<UL>
<LI>Architronic; The Electronic Journal of Architecture
<LI>International Journal of Applied Expert Systems
<LI>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research
<LI>Environmental Research News
<LI>Electronic Journal of Combinatorics
<LI>Federal Communications Law Journal
<LI>Digital Technical Journal
<LI>Conservation Ecology
<LI>New York Journal of Mathematics Home Page
<LI>Nasdaq Financial Journal
<LI>APL Online
</UL>

<P>
A comprehesive list is maintained at the <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch:80/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Electronic_Journals.html">World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Section on Electronic Journals </A>.
A recent article in Science reports over 70 fully electronic,
peer reviewed scholarly journals. Scientific American again reports
440 scientific journals and newsletter, 100 of which are peer
reviewed.
<P>
The proposed journal should make the bulk of its information available
on just-in-time basis. It should, however, regularly announce
the availability of the information using the broadcast channels.
It should be presented using standard formats which can be used
on a wide range of platforms over long periods of time.
<H2>4. Requirements on the journal from the viewpoint of authors
</H2>

<P>
From the viewpoint of potential authors the following functional
requirements on an electronic journal seem reasonable:
<UL>
<LI>Short waiting time from submission to publication
<LI>Fair and transparent review process
<LI>Constructive feedback from reviewers
<LI>Ease of producing a final formatted paper
<LI>High status of the journal in terms of academic credibility
<LI>Large dissemination (in terms of colleagues who find out about
and/or read the article)
<LI>Regular publication of reference information about the articles
in indexes and bibliographic databases (SCI, ICONDA, COMPENDEX
etc.)
</UL>

<H2>5. Requirements on the journal from the viewpoints of readers
</H2>

<P>
From the viewpoint of potential readers the following functional
requirements seem reasonable:
<UL>
<LI>Getting information about interesting papers as quickly as
they have been published
<LI>ability to access papers from one's own workstation
<LI>Low cost of obtaining an article
<LI>Ease of producing a paper copy of the paper (to scribble on,
for leisurely reading, for personal archiving)
<LI>Hypertext access to literature referenced in an article (for
the case of literature available in digital form somewhere on
WWW).
<LI>Ease of sending in possible comments and getting these published
</UL>

<H2>5. Typographical requirements on the journal</H2>

<P>
It is important that an electronic journal has at least the same
or possibly better reproduction capabilities as current printed
journals. The following features should be mandatory for both
on-screen viewing and print-outs.
<UL>
<LI>Different but uniform text styles
<LI>Characters of languages other than English (such as some Scandinavian
letters)
<LI>Vector-based figures and charts
<LI>Raster images in black and white
</UL>

<P>
The following features would also be useful but are not as essential
in the short run to get the journal running. Such features could
be added later on.
<UL>
<LI>Halftone photos
<LI>Mathematical formulae and notations
<LI>Colour images
<LI>Videostrips, multimedia and
<LI>Software demos
</UL>

<P>
Mathematical formulas and notations could be handled as vector-based
figures. The last two items could possibly be handled in the same
way as appendices, by inserting hyperlinks to separate documents
on the Web.
<H2>6. Scope of the journal</H2>

<P>
The scope of the proposed journal is closely related to the scope
of CIB working group W78 (Information Technology in Construction).
<P>
The aim is to report on academic research and innovative industrial
development work concerning the application of information technology
throughout the life-cycle of the design, construction and occupancy
of buildings and related facilities. The focus is on presenting
research results dealing with or having relevance across disciplines
and/or life-cycle stages. There are other, existing journals addressing
specialised analysis, synthesis or optimisation methods particular
to design or construction tasks within the individual subdisciples
of construction.
<P>
In the following some major topics which the journal aims to cover
are mentioned:
<UL>
<LI>IT strategies within organisations and groups, ranging from
the level of the individual firm to a consortium of firms to national
construction industries.
<LI>Construction process and enterprise modelling
<LI>Reengineering of the construction process using IT as an enabling
technology
<LI>Methods of concurrent engineering
<LI>IT-supported communication across or within disciplines and
life cycle stages (hypermedia, Internet, videoconferencing etc.)
<LI>Databases, translation methodologies, remote communication
between programs, shared object libraries and other computing
techniques for data exchange and sharing
<LI>Technologies and standards for the digital representation
of buildings (building product models)
<LI>Standards for structuring and exchanging data in the construction
process (building classification systems, EDI messages, CAD-layering,
document management, representation of building regulations, component
libraries)
<LI>The use of IT-based techniques for problem solving in construction
(expert systems and AI, case-based reasoning, simulation, neural
networks, the genetic algoritm et.c.).
</UL>

<P>
Papers eligible for publication should present original research
or be state-of the art reviews. Papers presenting research in
the early stages or research ideas only should be avoided. (We
should in fact stop talking about &quot;papers&quot; and use articles
or information, since paper is the medium we want to avoid as
far as possible.)
<P>
In addition to university researchers, the journal invites articles
from industrial researchers and developers, especially those presenting
how the new capabilities offered by IT are being incorporated
into software products, or how companies are applying state-of-the-art
IT solutions to design and construction practice.
<H2>7. Choice of working name and possible abbreviation for the
journal</H2>

<P>
The term electronic (or digital, Internet, on-line ) should be
included in the name to emphasise how this journal differs from
already existing ones. The suggested full name is Electronic Journal
of Information Technology in Construction.
<P>
In many connections it is handy to have an abbreviation. Such
an abbreviation could also be used as a LOGO in the home page
on WWW. In the following some alternatives are discussed:
<UL>
<LI>ICON sound good and compact but happens to be the name of
a current research project at Salford University, which might
cause some confusion.
<LI>ITEC is also compact but coincides with the name of a research
institute in Barcelona (organiser of the 1989 W78 meeting).
<LI>A longer possibility is ITECON.
<LI>One option is ITCON, which should be pronounced &quot;eye
tea con&quot;, rather than &quot;itcon&quot;. It could even be
spelled with IT in capital letters using a slightly bigger font
to emphasise the point. Or it could be spelled IT-CON.
<LI>The last suggestion is CITE (Construction IT / Electronic)
</UL>

<H2>8. Organisation for publishing the journal</H2>

<P>
The following overall organisation is suggested for running the
journal.
<H3>An official publishing organisation</H3>

<P>
It is important to have a background organisation with sufficient
legal status and an administrative apparatus to manage possible
money transactions etc. In the case of paper based journals at
least three options are commonly used ( commercial publishers,
universities and national professional associations).
<P>
The suggestion is that the Royal Institute of Technology could
function as official publisher.
<H3>A scientific community which the journal is related to</H3>

<P>
Obviously this should be CIB W78. The W78 board will be asked
to endorse the journal and W78 members will be filling the main
functions of the journal' s organisation. On the cover page of
the journal this endorsement should be clearly stated and hyperlinks
to the W78 home page should be inserted (and vice versa in the
W78 home page). The editors will regularly report to W78 on the
progress of the journal during meetings or using email.
<H3>A web site </H3>

<P>
This is where the articles, home pages etc. reside physically.
Ideally there should be two web sites, one of them being the primary
site, and the one which manages all the traffic of submissions
etc.
<P>
There are two alternatives for working with a such system of two
sites. A mirror site implies that part of the readers will use
the mirror, and part the primary site. The advantage is that the
mirror also reduces network traffic and may speed up access. The
disadvantage is that the mirror cannot be identical to the original
since the inbound information related to the review process must
be centralised.
<P>
A backup site implies that the site only pops into existence if
the original site is down or can not be accessed. In that case
it takes over full operations of the system. The advantage is
above all better security, and it is much easier to implement
than a mirror site. The disadvantage is that no traffic optimisation
takes place.
<P>
The suggestion is to start with one or even several backup sites.
These can later evolve into mirrors if this is needed due to traffic
volume or persistent network problems.
<P>
The suggestion is that the primary site should be at the University
of Ljubljana. A decision about a secondary site will be made later.
<P>
<U>An editor</U> 
<P>
The editor takes overall responsibility for the journal (in the
legal sense). He also has the major responsibility for the review
process and for the scientific quality of the journal. He functions
as the chairman of the executive board formed by himself and the
three associate editors.
<P>
The suggested editor is:
<P>
Prof. Bo-Christer Bj&ouml;rk Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm,
Sweden
<P>
<U>Three associate editors</U> 
<P>
Together with the editor these form the executive board of the
journal. All major decisions should preferably be worked out by
these four in consensus. One or two of the associate editors take
responsibility for the maintenance of the WWW sites and the email
traffic. All the associate editors help the editor in managing
the reviews of individual submitted papers.
<P>
Suggested associate editors are:
<P>
Prof. Charles Eastman UCLA, Los Angeles, USA
<P>
Asst. Prof. Ziga Turk University of Ljubljana, Slovenia
<P>
Dr. Dana Vanier IRC, Ottawa, CANADA
<P>
<U>A review committee</U> 
<P>
The main tasks of the review committee are to:
<UL>
<LI>Act as referees for papers
<LI>Promote the journal and encourage researchers to submit papers.
<LI>Take active part in the discussions following published papers.
<LI>Give feedback to the editors concerning the scope of the journal
and the editorial policy
</UL>

<P>
The review committee provides the core of experts for reviewing
the papers. As far as possible the reviewing assignments should
be kept within this board. One of the reasons for this is that
this may help in achieving consistent quality standards in the
review work. Another reason is that the practical arrangements
of managing the review process are easier with referees who are
familiar with the technicalities for downloading submitted articles
etc.
<P>
If reviews are predominantly solicited within the committee it
would consequently need to be rather large in number. The list
should in no way be closed but new members could be added continuously
as new referees are recruited.
<P>
In the choice of members the following criteria will be used.
<UL>
<LI>Geographical balance. (All major countries where there are
significant research activities should have at least one member)
<LI>Balance between different disciplines. (The major sub disciplines
within the construction process, such as architecture, structural
engineering, HVAC engineering, construction management etc. should
be represented)
<LI>Balance between academics, researchers from public research
organisations and practitioners. (The majority of members ought
to be academics, but research organisations as exemplified by
VTT, TNO, CSTB, IRC, NIST etc. should also be represented. A few
industry representatives ought also to be included).
<LI>The major research groups in this area should each have at
least one representative. (It would be advisable to include at
least one member from each of the major research groups, i.e.
CIFE, CMU).
<LI>Balance between senior and junior researchers. (Not only senior
professors should be included but also some younger researchers).
<LI>Strong participation from active CIB W78 members. Based on
these criteria a suitable number of members on the review committee
might be around 50. The number will probably grow with time.
</UL>

<P>
The four editors will together compile a list of candidates and
ask the included experts for their consent. This list will be
published in conjunction with the first call for papers or shortly
afterwards.
<H2>9. Submission and publication procedure</H2>

<P>
The submission and publication procedure consists of the following
steps:
<UL>
<LI>submission of an article
<LI>review
<LI>publication on WWW
<LI>dissemination of reference information to email lists, bibliographical
data bases etc.
<LI>possible printing of paper copies for libraries and for archiving
<LI>subsequent discussion
</UL>

<H2>10. Submission of an article</H2>

<P>
Articles should be submitted in electronic format only. Submissions
on paper or on floppy disks will be rejected and the authors asked
to kindly resubmit the article using the correct techniques. Articles
should be submitted to the executive board by email or (prefearably)
FTP with an accompanying e-mail message. Given the state of technology
and the availability of tools &quot;rich text format&quot; seems
most appropriate at this moment. Detailed guidelines for the submission
procedures and formats will be issued later.
<P>
The following requirements should be made on the papers in terms
of size, referencing etc.
<UL>
<LI>The Harvard system of referencing should be used
<LI>The length of papers should not be limited to be within a
fixed maximum and minimum, but the editors and referees will use
their judgements in indicating to authors a need for lengthening
or shortening the articles.
<LI>The language of the journal is English. Either UK or US English
is accepted.
</UL>

<P>
The editorial board has no facilities for making thorough checks
of the language of submitted papers. It is assumed that authors
have run the articles through spelling checkers. Foreign language
authors are in addition recommended to use native English speakers
for checking the language before the submission. A good policy
would be to always include at least one native English speaker
among the referees.
<P>
Formating guidelines and accompanying style sheets for Word for
Windows and Word for Macintosh will be made available. The suggested
styles will enable uniform look of the document on both the printed
(both US Letter and DIN A4 paper sizes will be supported) and
WWW versions. The system of heading numbering will also be specified.
An example article (taking some already published paper by one
of the editors) will be formatted according to the guidelines
and put on the WWW for authors
<P>
to look at.
<H2>11. Review procedure</H2>

<P>
The main editor and the three associate editors take turns in
being responsible for managing a submitted paper through the refereeing
process. The responsible editor assigns three reviewers. If he
so wishes he can be one of the three reviewers himself. He collects
the answers and makes the final decision concerning the paper.
The internet system will be set up in such a way that only the
editor and the associate editors will have the authorisation to
set up papers in the journal.
<P>
The referees can suggest:
<UL>
<LI>the acceptance of a paper as such or with minor typographical
corrections,
<LI>that the paper is rewritten and submitted for a new review
by the same reviewers. In such a case a written comment of about
one page is required.
<LI>that the paper is unsuitable for publication in this journal
. Also in this case the reviewers should supply comments for the
author.
</UL>

<P>
The suggested approach to the review process could be based on
email communication between the editor and the reviewers. This
mode could function is such a way that the three reviewers first
work independently without knowing each other's identity. Reviewers
will get electronic copies of the submitted papers in exactly
the same format as the final published papers. Ideally they should
be able to write comments digitally into the papers themselves,
but this may be too demanding . Many reviewers will wish to print
out the papers, take the stuff home over the weekend and scribble
on the printed copy. The suggestion is that the evaluation page
is available as an email template.
<P>
A question to debate is how much freedom of choice the editor
in charge should be given. At one extreme is a situation where
the opinions of the referees are only indicative and where the
responsible editor has the final say. In a more formalised approach
a truth table could be made of the choices open for the editor.
<P>
If all three referees indicate acceptance of the paper with or
without minor corrections it should be accepted. The responsible
editor checks that the typographical corrections, if they have
been requested, have been made. Similarly if all three referees
suggest either rewriting or rejection that suggestion should be
followed.
<P>
If the referees differ in opinion the responsible editor should
start a short email conference with the three referees, to see
if a consensus could be reached (after they have read each others
comments on the submitted article). If no consensus is reached
in a reasonable time the responsible editor makes the decision
based on his own judgement.
<P>
Also in the case of an unanimous decision the referees should
be allowed to see each others comments ( which is much better
than the practice of many current journals, where you get very
little feedback on your referee work).
<H2>12. Publication on the World Wide Web.</H2>

<P>
KTH takes care of the ISSN number for the journal. The journal
has yearly volumes, which follow calendar years. Within a volume
articles are numbered sequentially from 1 to n. There are no separate
issues within a volume.
<P>
Each paper is put on the web by the responsible editor. Alternatively
this is handled by somebody at the web site, after he has gotten
the OK from the editor in charge. The full information of an article
includes:
<UL>
<LI>citation information (keywords)
<LI>abstract
<LI>about the author information
<LI>full text for on-screen reading
<LI>full text for printing
<LI>electronic appendices (pointers to demos etc.)
<LI>discussion threads on the paper
</UL>

<P>
The full text for on-screen reading should use WWW's native HTML
language. The format should be ergonomic for quick browsing. In
addition to straight off reading it should contain hyperlinks
to other information available on the web (such as earlier articles
published in this journal). In the first issues these hyperlinks
should be limited to the list of references section only ( at
the end of the paper). The author would supply the links. In addition
a hyperlink should be inserted at the end of the paper if any
discussion has followed.
<P>
Any other more elaborate hypertext schemes are, of course, exciting,
but will probably lead to technical problems and too much work
for the editors. Such schemes can be added later on if they appear
feasible.
<P>
The second format is for printing out on a local laser printer.
The printouts should look almost the same as today's paper based
articles. Postscript has been suggested as the print format.
<P>
Authors should be encouraged to place large appendices to the
papers as separate items on some WWW site and indicate the route
to them in the original paper. This implies that even software
demos or short videofilms could be appendices. There are however
some technical problems and problems of how strictly such appendices
should be reviewed which need to be sorted out.
<H2>13. Possible additional content of the journal</H2>

<P>
The journal could contain some add-on material of interest, which
would be affiliated with the journal or made very obvious by hyperlinks
for the occasional reader.
<UL>
<LI>Abstracts of academic dissertations within the scope of the
journal
<LI>Short bibliographic information including scanned photograph
of the editorial board and review committee to be put on the WWW
server
<LI>Discussion of the articles
</UL>

<P>
Especially the discussion part could be quite exciting compared
to traditional paper based journals. The discussion should be
relatively free with only limited censorship and delays. The party
submitting a discussion item should email it to the editor responsible,
who should check that the proposed items fulfils some minimum
requirements on language, format and courtesy. We should welcome
discussions with two-way communication between the commentator
and the author of the original articple, but not quite as personalised
as some email conference discussions have turned out to be. Discussion
items will be advertised in the original paper by a hyperlink
(put there later on by the responsible editor) indicating follow-up
discussion.
<P>
The inclusion of shorter papers presenting research in progress
has also been suggested. In the initial stages of the journal
authors of such papers should be encouraged to submit these to
coming-up conferences such as the W78 conferences, rather than
including these in the journal proper. In the near future also
w78 proceedings may be made available immediately after the conferences
on WWW. In that case it would be easy to have cross referenced
hyperlinks between the journal and the proceedings.
<P>
Later on, if there are strong indications that readers of the
journal wish to have a separate work in progress section, this
issue could be reconsidered.
<H2>14. Dissemination</H2>

<P>
The basic policy is that the journal is free of charge. Subscription
could be in the form of enlisting on a particular email list which
regularily disseminates messages on what articles have been published.
Alternatively existing email channels could be used for these
messages (which may lead to people getting the same mail several
times). At least in the first year it might be a good idea using
existing channels to get people aware of the journal.
<P>
The question of copyright is complicate. Normally a commercial
journal secures the right to publish the article in other formats,
such as anthologies etc. Special permission has to be asked to
be asked for any subsequent publications. In this context a looser
policy seem appropriate, say that the author has free right to
republish the article in other media, provided that it is clearly
stated in any subsequent publication where the article was first
published. He would thus for instance have the right to include
it in his university's local WWW server if he so wishes.
<P>
The journal would on the other hand have the option of later publishing
bound paper volumes of the journal, CD-ROMs etc. without getting
additional consent from the author.
<P>
A rather good formulation which could be used as a basis for defining
a copyrigth clause is the Architronic one:
<P>
Authors of contributions to Architronic retain copyright and all
intellectual property rights appertaining to their works, including
but not limited to all rights to authorise subsequent publication
and/or translation. Any factual inaccuracies or opinions expressed
therein are the authors' own, and do not necessarily reflect the
knowledge, views, or positions of Kent State University, any of
the university's units, or Architronic's editors.
<P>
Material appearing in Architronic may be distributed freely by
electronic or any other means, providing that any such distribution
is without charge (unless for purposes of cost recovery by interlibrary
loan services) and that Architronic is acknowledged as the source.
However, no article may be reprinted in any publication without
the explicit written permission of the author(s). This statement
must accompany all distributions of Architronic, whether complete
or partial.
<H2>15. Possible paper version</H2>

<P>
The question of publishing in a paper format is tricky. One possibility
is to start off with annual or semi-annual bound volumes (the
periodicity should be determined so that the thickness and weight
of the separate volumes make them easy to handle). These could
be produced as cheaply as possible using offset. The idea would
be to sell these at a price which is comparable to the prices
asked by commercial refereed papers for a years subscription.
The marketing should be handled as cheaply as possible.
<P>
The problem is that if we start parallel paper-based printing
and find that it's not economical or otherwise feasible it's difficult
to stop after a short time. Another option is to start only electronically
and make printed copies of the journal available if there is sufficient
interest. What will be provided in any way for research groups
and libraries wishing to make paper copies is the volume title
page which could be placed on top of a binder, as well as the
table of contents of the volume in question.
<P>
In any case archival laser printed originals of all papers should
be stored in safe places such as the KTH library. In real emergencies
the library would be allowed to sell paper copies of articles
according to the normal way a technical library functions.
<H2>16. Marketing policy</H2>

<P>
The affiliation with CIB W78 is fairly clear. On a political level
it could be a good idea to inform the CIB central secretariat
in Rotterdam about the journal before the journal starts operating.
From CIB's viewpoint the journal could be an interesting pilot
and other working commissions may want to follow suit.
<P>
The marketing of the journal should, as a rule, be done electronically
only. Some exceptions could be made to this rule in the initial
stages. A press release should be made and sent to organisations
such as CICA, ACADS, ACADIA etc. for publication if they so wish,
especially to attract attention from industry. The journal could
also be presented in a flyer to be distributed at some major conferences
this year (ASCE, W78, CAAD futures, etc.).
<P>
In order to keep an open policy the journal should regularly publish
statistics on key facts such as:
<UL>
<LI>Ratio of submissions to accepted papers
<LI>Number of accesses to the journals WWW site. Number of down-loaded
copies of papers.
</UL>
