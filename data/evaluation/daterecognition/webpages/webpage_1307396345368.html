					<p>Welcome to my rant <img src='http://blog.donandjeremy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>I want to give everyone fair warning. This is going to be negative. There is going to be foul language. So, if you are one of those people that can only read positive things, or blushes at the sound or sight of profanity&#8230;leave now&#8230;I&#8217;m serious. This is a poorly thought out and probably poorly executed rant so, read at your own risk.</p>
<p>/begin affiliate career suicide</p>
<p>When I started Internet Marketing a little over 2 years ago, my main mission and goal was to set up a bunch of little niche sites, write a bunch of articles, and make a bunch of money. My business plan was something like this:</p>
<p>1. Find offer<br />
2. Find Keywords<br />
3. Write till my fingers hurt<br />
4. ???<br />
5. ???<br />
6 Profit</p>
<p>Pretty sweet business plan&#8230;huh? Well, surprisingly the shit worked&#8230;and worked VERY WELL. It wasn&#8217;t long before I was making a couple extra G&#8217;s a month, and life was good. So, like anyone excited in Internet Marketing, I ran to a forum and made a post about what I was doing, and how much money I was making. I&#8217;ll be damned if that thread didn&#8217;t get like 50 pages long, and I didn&#8217;t get over 100 PM&#8217;s from people asking me how I did it.</p>
<p>I also got some PM&#8217;s from a few product creators that said: &#8220;dude, you would be nuts not to make a product about this&#8221; So, I did&#8230; and I sold over 700 copies of that product at $22 a piece&#8230;good times&#8230;good times</p>
<p>After that, I met up with Don, and we started doing all kinds of cool shit from CPA, to even starting up an Offline company a little over a year ago, so the Internet has definitely been good for me, but probably the last 6 months has really made me rethink which direction that I want to go.</p>
<p>You see, after selling my first product, I was all like: &#8220;how cool would it be to make products and have some of these big affiliates promote it..Man, I would bank so hard!&#8221; And while I was doing my niche marketing, and doing my CPA stuff, and running an offline company that same thought was always in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>THEN I STARTED SEEING THINGS FOR WHAT THEY WERE&#8230;</p>
<p>When Don and I make a product we do it for a couple reasons. One of them being that it is a good change of pace from the normal stuff we do, the other is that it gives a nice cash boost for things like buying my 17 year old a car, or for Don going on vacation for a month. It&#8217;s just fun money if you know what I mean. We definitely like the money&#8230;but, we&#8217;re not out to break the bank or anything, or to take someones last dollar.</p>
<p>But, when I took a long hard look at the affiliate &#8220;circle&#8221; that I once wanted to be a part of, to be honest&#8230;I was a little bit disgusted. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are tons of affiliates, and product creator out there that are HONEST and actually market with INTEGRITY, but when you really look at the guys that are very visible&#8230;the ones that kind of define affiliate marketing&#8230;the ones that everyone knows about&#8230; the ones hammering out product after product&#8230;well, it&#8217;s a different story. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the &#8220;new breed&#8221; because in all honesty, I would probably still shell out a couple grand for a Frank Kern product because the ones that I&#8217;ve seen actually provided value to me&#8230;they actually gave me some legitimate insight, and to me at least were worth the money I paid. The new breed though cranks out high ticket &#8211; low value products weekly it seems like..and the worst part is if you actually read the products, it doesn&#8217;t take you long to figure out that they have no clue what the fuck they are talking about. They are doing nothing but shooting fish in a barrel..and you are likely one of those fish. </p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s talk about a couple of big launch patterns lately that were being sold for at least a COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS. </p>
<p>A few of them were using the angle of telling all of us dumb asses about some secret site that gets gazillions of visitors a month and offers laser targeted<br />
traffic&#8230;Hell, according to them, just knowing about this site would put enough money in your pocket that you could wipe your ass with hundred dollar bills. Now, guess what the secret site was&#8230;go ahead&#8230;guess. Still don&#8217;t know? IT WAS FACEBOOK! Holy shit, these guys really do think we are stupid, and hell, we might be stupid. After all, we just paid a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, in some cases to someone that has probably never spent a SINGLE DOLLAR advertising on FaceBook. I mean, come on..It would be one thing if they showed how to use the advertising platform, how to target demographics, and how to bank, but for the most part, they were just letting us know about the sites existence. </p>
<p>Then you had the barrage of products that aimed to fill us all in on the super secret ways to get traffic from search engines. According to the sales letters, and all of the idiots spamming Googles index with with review pages for these products..the were the end all of all traffic products! Shit, the secrets that they were given away would get you more traffic than the free needle van in the ghetto&#8230;That&#8217;s a shit load of traffic right. Well, my dumb ass decided&#8230;what the hell, I&#8217;ll go ahead and grab a couple of these to see what&#8217;s up. I mean, if I can get more traffic than the free needle van, I could do some serious damage, right?</p>
<p>So, I read em&#8217;, watch the videos, and than call the police immediately because I realize I&#8217;ve been penetrated! Not only did I not find any secrets, but the secrets that they thought they were sharing have been in ebooks sold on DP that were stolen from people on the warrior forum who stole them from blackhat world who stole them from wickedfire, who stole them from pedo bear at ASE. I mean, the circle jerk involved here is HUGE, even days later, I&#8217;m still trying to figure out who the pivot man is.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are some excellent products out there, so don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m hating on all information products, because I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m specifically talking about the &#8220;launch group&#8221; whose only intention is to cash in on shit that they have no idea about. It&#8217;s gotten to the point where they don&#8217;t even care if you know that they don&#8217;t know anything about it. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example, and a somewhat true story.</p>
<p>Guru A makes a product and in his launch material and sales copy says that Twitter sucks, and only losers use Twitter. He then sells an ungodly number of his anti-twitter product &#8211; KA CHING! Then&#8230;2 weeks later proclaims that he is a Twitter expert and he wants to show you how to dominate twitter&#8230;because everyone knows that If you don&#8217;t know Twitter&#8230;you don&#8217;t know shit. Wait&#8230;wut?</p>
<p>At this point you would think that the B-Team (his/her affiliates) would be like&#8230;&#8221;dude, we can&#8217;t promote this crap&#8230;just last week, you said twitter sucked!) But, did they do that? Hell no&#8230;they promoted that shit like Jesus Christ himself took the time to make the product, and that just by reading it you would have access to 21 virgins&#8230;it was a real religious experience. </p>
<p>The bottom line is, they have the buyers (you?) trained so well that you will buy whatever the hell it is that they want to sell you. Nothing personal&#8230;It&#8217;s just business, right?&#8230;and while you&#8217;re at it, make sure that you buy the 27 up and down sells&#8230;which will without a doubt consist of:</p>
<p>21 offers for a &#8220;lost chapter&#8221; which they will without shame tell you that without it their product won&#8217;t work<br />
3 offers for software that won&#8217;t be done for another 6 months<br />
&#8230;and 3 offers for a forum that you won&#8217;t be able to access for 2 months which will promptly be deleted as soon as people start to complain that they aren&#8217;t making any money</p>
<p>No big deal anyway though, because according to their next sales letter that product will suck anyway&#8230;the next product, and the next 27 up and down sells is exactly what you need. Cool, huh?</p>
<p>Listen, I know that this is a business, and selling information products IS A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS MODEL. However, Being a douche bag while you do it, being a lying sack of shit, and being a parasite should be grounds for getting your ass kicked. </p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>You would have one hell of a time getting to any of these guys to kick their ass&#8230;Their &#8220;b-teams&#8221; would lay down their lives, ruin their own reputations, and do whatever necessary to keep your grubby hands, the truth, or reality far far away from their &#8220;gurus&#8221;. You see, in some respects, the B-Team is probably worse than the &#8220;bad&#8221; product creators. Typically, the B-Team are people you trust, maybe someone you picked up some good tips from. These are the guys that fill your inboxes up with email after email at launch time&#8230;these are the guys that are &#8220;setting you up&#8221; by saying things like&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known XXX for a long time and he&#8217;s the real deal&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;XXX showed me what he was doing, and I was actually shocked&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;XXX helped me take me triple my revenue, and he will help you too&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the time, they don&#8217;t know the guru, the guru has never shown them shit, and the only thing that the guru has ever given them is a series of shitty emails to fill your inbox up with to get you to a squeeze page so that you can get on the gurus list&#8230;so that they can get a commission. And they will continue this process and repeat it over and over again until you opt out of their list. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to wrap this rant up now, but understand this&#8230;Internet Marketing is filled with predators. Sure, they want you to think that they are there to help you&#8230;blah blah blah&#8230;but, their number one goal is to get your money at any and all costs. Stop being an idiot&#8230;the next time someone tries to sell you an info product for a couple hundred or a couple thousand dollars that is filled with nothing but interviews from 4 years ago, and tells you go to FaceBook and get rich, or start a blog and you will be a millionaire..tell them to kiss your ass, and then punch then kick them in the nuts if you are close<br />
enough to them to get a shot in. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also filled with a lot of good and genuine people, but you have to use common sense to separate the good guys from the bad guys&#8230;nobody can really do that for you. </p>
<p>/rant</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t agree more with you. This is one the reasons I am a loyal customer of yours. You tell us as it is and not how we want to hear. </p>
<p>I remember a Guru who trashed Google was praising it few weeks ago in another launch. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s just the way it is. There is a hungry market and they are feeding it. </p>
<p>Problem is people need to become intelligent and really decide as grown ups if they need these new shiny objects every week ? </p>
<p>All the best.</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>Jeremy, you certainly have a way with words. I only hope the B-list people see this because they are the ones that perpetuate the crappy products by supporting their idols. Chances are though, they want to be just like their idols and don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s behind about their list members. </p>
<p>I agree with Tina, keep telling it like it is, maybe some of them will catch on.</p>

Oh man it&#8217;s nice to hear somebody put into &#8230;ah words, what a lot of us are probably thinking and suspecting.<br />
But too, shame on us for buying more than once. It&#8217;s the people new to the game who are getting robbed, who don&#8217;t realize the claims are pure BS. The most money probably goes to the copywriter &#8211; &#8217;cause some of the salepages are pretty slick. </p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>Here Here, it is really shocking how the IM niche has been devolving lately. First mobile monopoly and now auto-traffic avalanche. It is a sad truth that the majority of money made in the IM niche is done through selling the dream by telling the suckers what they want to hear.</p>
<p>Worse still as you pointed out, their affiliates keep peddling the crap with complete disregard for their subscribers. It is amazing how many people don&#8217;t seem to care about their reputations.</p>
<p>What a lot of these idiots who spam people with those contrived emails don&#8217;t seem to understand is that people like Frank Kern et al can get away with it because there are more than enough newbes subscribing to their lists everyday to make up the difference.</p>
<p>I really have to laugh at that Daniel Brock guy, writing in that thread on WF about hype and upsells that you have to do it. ROFLMAO</p>
<p>Ironically, he peddles his amazon profit system despite not too long ago releasing a list building course with the tagline that the amazon affiliate program was dead due to Google entering the affiliate market arena by promoting products in their search results, stupidly enough, he said in the sales letter for it that once he had sold x amount of units he would remove it as a stand alone product and add it as an upsell for his amazon afilliate marketing product.</p>
<p>Lol, just when you think you have seen it all.</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>Sorry to post twice&#8230;but here is some good advice</p>
<p>Check out the Reviews section of the Warrior forum before you even think about buying a launch(ie product $67 or more)</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, you will discover that the product is crap, and you just saved yourself $$$ that can be invested back into your business</p>

Of course what you said is true but the shame of it is that some of these people now spamming for all their worth once provided good quality information and/or products for sensible money.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve seen other well known marketers making money doing it and have been been lured into lowering their standards in the chase for more dollars.</p>
<p>More annoying is the fact that you cannot unsubscribe from some of them!</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>D tan from the warrior forum is a perfect example of this. Someone from the wf released an seo challenge a while ago and d tan promoted it to his list.

I unsubscribed from tans list as his last keyword wso was a crock of shit. Unfortunately there are many others like him. They are only out to rape your wallet. GreAt post Jeremy.</p>
<p>P.s you and don Rock !!</p>

<p>Any time a new launch comes out I take a look at the sales page just to laugh but I never feel the urge buy. However, any newcomer to the game gets excited and doesn&#8217;t know better and then buys!</p>
<p>This is why Jeremy and Don have such a solid customer base, they tell it how it is! Im on Mark Dickenson&#8217;s list and hes another one to listen to!</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe these people can&#8217;t work it out for themselves. If something is too good to be true then it is!! Simple.. </p>
<p>Making money on the internet isn&#8217;t easy. It&#8217;s not push button&#8230; Yes it&#8217;s easier than a 9 &#8211; 5 job but it takes that many hours a day (if not more) to get your online business off the ground. You have to learn the ropes yourself 1st before others can start doing the grunt work for you.</p>
<p>It all boils down to -</p>
<p>Traffic + Built Relationships (optin) + Converting Valuable Offers = $$$$</p>
<p>Give you subscribers what they want&#8230;</p>
<p>All these shiny new products are just different parts of the equation.. Traffic, relationship building, selling, etc..</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a multimillion pound blueprint for you -</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you go find a desperate niche and find out what they want. Search forums, etc&#8230; Put together a small report giving what they want. Set up an optin list. Use one traffic method such as Article Marketing or paid PPC. </p>
<p>Get good at driving traffic with this one method. Give give and give your list what they want for a few months.</p>
<p>Make sure it&#8217;s valuable and answers their burning questiond and desires.</p>
<p>Concentrate on building a quality list. Once you&#8217;ve been doing this for a few months ask your list what they want..</p>
<p>Survey them.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got this valuable market research from them put together a product that matches these wishes.</p>
<p>Sell it to them. </p>
<p>Add it into your sales funnel (autoresponder)  and keep driving the traffic.</p>
<p>Find good quality affiliate products that match these needs in different formats.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<p>Home study courses on dvd, etc.</p>
<p>Go back to your list and ask questions. Give them the answers.</p>
<p>Optional &#8211; create a membership site. A simple autoresponder membership model will do. Keep it simple. Offer weekly articles, videos, etc.</p>
<p>This will bring in recurring incomes.</p>
<p>Add the upsell to the membership site to your products.</p>
<p>If you want you could sell this entire buisness after it&#8217;s earning some good money or you could outsource to a VA and have them run it for you.</p>
<p>Go put that to good use and stop buying all the latest products one after another..</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>Hey Jeremy,</p>
<p>You know I like the pair of you, but you also know that I say it as I see it &#8211; even to my friends. I reckon that like me, you pay attention to a lot of what&#8217;s written across the spectrum of IM &#8211; so you have probably read some of Barman&#8217;s recent blog posts as well as Salty&#8217;s?</p>
<p>If so, you would have noticed how Barman pointed out that what he hates about the IM crowd is when they sell genuine underground techniques to the newb masses and in the process destroy something good that was working for a large group of underground people &#8211; the kind of people who just get on with it, don&#8217;t fleece newbs or sell IM crud and quietly make a good living &#8211; their techniques get overrun or slapped out of existence so that some cocky IMer can flog his ebook &#8211; lots of people lose out so one person can gain.</p>
<p>I think he was referring to the POF thing, but I understand his point and I feel the same when I see the IM crowd desperately seeking some &#8216;secret&#8217; that they&#8217;ve never tried, surrounding it with fluff and flogging it &#8211; thus fleecing the newbs and everybody else in the process just to make a few bob &#8211; ultimately, it&#8217;s the big boys like Google that gain the most and everyone else gets shafted.</p>
<p>My point is that it&#8217;s not just the gurus or &#8216;the B list&#8217; (isn&#8217;t that a Salty-coined phrase?) who are screwing things up for the genuine, hard-working little guys. It&#8217;s the whole big mess and everyone who contributes to it.</p>
<p>Too many people have just got too much to say (including myself at times), to the point where they seem to be forgetting what they said not so long ago, or where what they are saying originally came from.</p>
<p>On that note, as an honest friend, I would invite you to re-read the last five paragraphs of your April 29th &#8216;Land Of Cry Babies&#8217; post on this blog, where you seem to be saying the exact opposite of what you have said here.</p>
<p>My advice to you is from the first sentence of that first paragraph -</p>
<p>&#8216;Don’t let yourself get caught up in the bullshit that is Internet Marketing.&#8217;</p>
<p>Personally I think it&#8217;s time that people decided which camp they are in. They are either working the internet to make a living, or they&#8217;re flogging snake-oil to newbs. If they&#8217;re working the internet like a pro, then they don&#8217;t need to flog the oil &#8211; it&#8217;s beneath them.</p>
<p>If they want to flog the oil &#8211; fine. But then they won&#8217;t need to question why the rest of us hate their guts (RE &#8211; the Barman thing).</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible for people to do both things at once and retain any kind of integrity because you can&#8217;t make money underground using techniques that you also sell to &#8216;the crowd&#8217; &#8211; because the crowd will destroy those techniques &#8211; hence what they&#8217;re selling doesn&#8217;t work!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll finish by quoting you from that post -</p>
<p>&#8216;hopefully it will give a few of you something to think about…and in the end, maybe even motivate you to spend more time on your business, and less time getting caught up in the “whose doing what” game that seems to be so popular these days.&#8217;</p>

<p>When I wrote Internet Marketing morons and cry babies, a big inspiration for writing that was things like people complaining about getting emailed after the opted in, or people just whining in general. The things that I talked about in this post are at least borderline illegal practices that some of these clowns are pulling off. </p>
<p>Or maybe I just had a change of heart?</p>
<p>After all, it was a rant, and as I admitted in the beginning of it&#8230;probably a poorly thought out and poorly executed one&#8230;I don&#8217;t think that there is anything wrong with selling information products, hell I don&#8217;t even think there is anything wrong with selling BAD information products. The BAD comes from how the products are sold, and how many times you sell your soul to get someone to him the buy button. </p>
<p>The whole post was more of me putting to words what I was thinking at the moment than anything else..so, it&#8217;s just one of those it is what it is type things.</p>

While these guys certainly aren&#8217;t all saints either, I think it&#8217;s still a very far cry from these typcial ClickBank launches the new breed does, where the product is really just a little fluff and it&#8217;s actually all just about cramming as many people as possible into their upsell/downsell/exit-pop labyrinth.</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>This may be offensive to some so do not read if you are delicate.</p>
<p>This rant struck close to my heart because for months I have been seething at the attempted seduction taking place from my inbox. Daily, heck hourly, there seems to be a new product that supposedly is making the creator huge amounts of money. The B-team doesn&#8217;t even have the originality to change the suggested script so you have a row of emails with the same subject. Immediate unsubscribe as they have been found out.  I have long envisioned a coven of internet marketers in a large circle jerk over each of their products to give it that special touch. This is no longer affiliate marketing. Some of the crap is just one big affiliate orgy. They just keep selling the products to each other, and try to get other souls to join the coven.One of the major problems is the really good people that we need to listen,  you don&#8217;t hear from unless they have a new product that actually took awhile for development,a rare recommendation of a  product, or they have a rant (but nobody as colorful as Jeremy).  I am so over letting myself be screwed and my wallet, heck my bank emptied by assholes that know less about IM then I do. But they learned how to seduce. I have had new rules for a few weeks: You are unsubscribed if: you contact me more than I talk to my mother, or even my husband; you contact me with one sentence that includes an affiliate link for an IM product; you mention a product from some guru that I have never heard of or when I research there is nothing nice to be said or can&#8217;t find anything so I know they are in witness protection; you show me pictures of a mansion-like house or an expensive car; on your site,blog or email you never mention your family or charities (proof that you are an alien from a planet taking over earth). These people have given new meaning to the term &#8220;I got your back.&#8221;</p>
<p> I have had to take a job for bank so I can refund my dreams. When I have some extra, I have a couple links of products that sound like they could help me accomplish my goals. Yes, they are both Don &amp; Jeremy. With them I know when they say &#8220;I got your back&#8221; I don&#8217;t have to reach for the vaseline.</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>That was great! All I can say is that i&#8217;ve spent the last month unsubscribing from lists that I&#8217;ve received the same subject line from promoting every product known to man.</p>
<p>As was stated above, there is no creativity and you have to know 50 other people are receiving the same subject line when you promote as an affiliate.</p>
<p>I go to the WF, read a lot of negative comments about the product and off the list I go.</p>
<p>My best advise, if there is someone who actually writes compelling emails, is to have a specific yahoo or gmail for &#8220;email copy&#8221; swipe files. That way you can use them as a model if you are getting into email marketing.</p>
<p>For those that find themselves buying every new shiny IM product, realize that these folks are HIRING good copywriters to sell you on a dream. Think about that for one second. Someone else, a person who is really good at word-smithing as Eben Pagan would say, is doing some serious creative writing. </p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve done recently to enhance my own skills to learn some copywriting. Eben Pagan states that it is one of the most valuable skills you can learn that will give you the most ROI. Also, I specifically sought out and picked up a few email specific courses because that is an area I am interested in developing.</p>
<p>As far as everything else, let it go. Every two weeks a &#8220;NEW&#8221; and &#8220;SECRET&#8221; course will be release by someone.<br />
As was mentioned above by Mark Dickerson I believe, wait until it&#8217;s released, then checkout the fallout on the warrior forum. Save yourself the aggravation.</p>
<p>SO there you have it.<br />
1. Unsubscibe from anyone who keeps promoting crap to<br />
your inbox.<br />
2. Create an inbox for &#8216;research purposes&#8217; for those that have good email copy and use them as a model<br />
3. When you hear of a new launch, wait until it is released, read the reviews on the WF<br />
4. Realize that some high priced copywriter is pulling your emotional buttons with the sales copy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny that Jeremy came out with this rant. I just read another rant by Jason Fladien I think his name is. Scary how similar the rants are. Read it here if you like:<br />
<a href="http://48hourreport.com/myblog/stayawa/" rel="nofollow">http://48hourreport.com/myblog/stayawa/</a></p>
<p>Anyway, Keep them coming Jeremy. You guys know I am a customer of yours and always keep an eye out for what guys offer. </p>

<p>I am really glad she came out with that product because it will really help those who need it&#8230;and it won&#8217;t get saturated</p>
<p>The IM world needs more people like Sara</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>Right on! I know there is money to be made in these pathetic product launches but I cannot bring myself to do it.</p>
<p>After reading some of the bullshit in my in-box lately, I&#8217;ve had to take a long hot shower. Scamming money from people is bad enough-but trampling their hopes and dreams, over and over, is sinister.</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>Yes-very well said. The internet has become the new &#8220;biz-opp&#8221; crapfest. It used to be done with direct mail and those crappy &#8220;opportunity&#8221; magazines where they always told you about a &#8220;secret plan&#8221; or system that will make you rich while you sat on your ass sippin margaritas on the beach. They all base their success on one important principle: sell the dream-even if its an illusion and and couldn&#8217;t work in a million years. Almost all of the old mail order biz opp systems were just made up crap just like the present day IM launch leeches promote. They only make money hypnotizing their subjests with their ninja copywriting and churning out their info crap.</p>

						<div class="commentmetadata_text"><p>I think that many of these gurus / product launchers have just disassociated (is this a word?) from the human element of what they are doing to people. It is all about the process &#8211; the marketing &#8211; and of course, the money!</p>
<p>The best email of the week was one from Ryan Deiss (i believe you indirectly referenced him <img src='http://blog.donandjeremy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  &#8211; anyway, it is a video for facebook marketing where he basically says &#8211; google sucks, seo is hard and he is NO SEO expert. Of course, he recently launched his Google/SEO Expert Product!!</p>
