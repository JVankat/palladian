<p><strong>Is a U.S. trademark registration necessary to enforce your   rights?</strong></p>
<p>No. Trademark rights in the United States arise from using a trademark, not   from registration. If you are making <A href="ipbasics.cfm?IDName=DeptID&ID=403">proper trademark   use</A> of your mark, you can successfully sue for an injunction or damages,   even in federal court, based solely upon your earlier use of that mark. These   are called common law trademark rights, and they are limited in geographic   scope. In order to assert your common law trademark rights, you must be able to   show that you were the first to offer and sell your goods and services in the   geographic area of the infringing activity you seek to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Is a state trademark registration worth pursuing?</strong></p>
<p>Each of the 50 states operates a trademark office within the secretary of   state's office. However, because state registrations generally grant no rights   that you do not already possess under common law, the value of a state trademark   registration is limited. Because no examination is made by state authorities to   assess whether there are any existing state or federal registrations that are   confusingly similar to the mark sought to be registered with the state,   infringing marks can co-exist on a state trademark register. State registrations   often create a false sense of ownership. If you have further questions about a   state registration, contact a competent trademark attorney in your state.</p>
<p><strong>Owning a U.S. registration does provide certain advantages:</strong></p>
<UL type="square">
  <LI><strong>Nationwide Priority Date</strong>. The filing of a U.S. registration   application establishes a nationwide priority date that can far pre-date the   date you first begin to use a mark.<br></li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Presumption of Validity and Ownership</strong>. Owning a registration   creates a presumption that the trademark is valid, that you are the owner, and   that you have the exclusive right to use the mark in commerce.<br></li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Constructive Notice</strong>. Registration gives constructive notice to   all third parties that you own the registered mark, thus eliminating any defense   of good faith adoption after the filing date.<br>
  </li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Easily Searched</strong>. Registered marks are easily searched,   reducing the chances that a competitor will unknowingly adopt a closely similar   mark.<br></li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Customs Service Protection</strong>. A registered mark can be recorded   with the U.S. Customs Service and used to deny entry into the U.S. of any   infringing or counterfeit products.<br>
  </li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Incontestability</strong>. After five years, a registration may become   "incontestable," eliminating a number of defenses that might otherwise be   available to an infringer, including the defense that your mark is descriptive.<br></li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Delaying Costs of Filing in Other Countries</strong>. Most countries   permit U.S. applicants to assert the filing date of their U.S. trademark   application as a priority date for their foreign application, provided the   foreign application is filed within six months of the U.S. filing date.   Essentially, this allows U.S. applicants to postpone the expense of foreign   trademark filings for up to six months, without any loss of priority   date.<br></li><br>
</UL>
<p><strong>Why bother to seek a U.S. registration?</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions and then contact your trademark lawyer or email   us at <A href="mailto:info@iph2.com">info@iph2.com</A>.</p>
<UL type="square">
  <LI><strong>Do you care if someone else were to adopt "your" trademark in a   far-off part of the United States?</strong> If the answer is no, you are only   concerned with infringers in your local geographic area, then the advantages of   filing a U.S. registration may not outweigh the costs.<br>
  </li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Can you imagine spending several thousand dollars or more enforcing   your trademark rights against a third party, either now or some time in the   future?</strong> If not, consider saving the money you would spend on a full   trademark search, and rely on your common law trademark rights rather than   seeking a federal registration. If you are just beginning to use a mark,   conducting a good search may be more crucial than owning a U.S. registration.<br></li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Are you currently making nationwide use of your mark, or will you be   doing so very soon (say within the next few weeks)?</strong> If not, filing a   U.S. application will allow you to secure a nationwide priority date immediately   and will grant you nationwide rights that can be enforced once your registration   issues.<br></li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Are you worried about competition from foreign-made, counterfeit   goods?</strong> If so, the benefits of U.S. Custom Service Protection make   pursuing a registration worthwhile.<br></li><br>
</UL>
<p><strong>What is involved in the registration process?</strong></p>
<p>To obtain a federal trademark registration, an application must be filed,   along with a filing fee of $325 per class. It takes about twelve to 36 months from the   date of filing to obtain a U.S. registration, but your priority date relates   back to the date of filing.</p>
<p><strong>During the review period, your application must clear two   hurdles:</strong></p>
<UL type="square">
  <LI><strong>Pre-publication Examination</strong>. A trademark attorney within the   U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") will be assigned to examine your   application to confirm that it meets all of the statutory requirements, that the   goods and services you are (or will be) selling under the mark are specifically   described, that your mark is sufficiently distinctive and not descriptive, and   that there are no confusingly similar, earlier-filed applications or existing   registrations that conflict with your application.<br></li><br>   
  <LI><strong>Publication</strong>. Once the examining attorney in the PTO accepts   your application for publication, it is published in the Official Gazette, a   government publication monitored by many trademark owners and watching services. Any third party may   oppose your application within thirty days of publication, if they believe they   would be injured by your application registering. Usually, this means they own   an earlier registration or have earlier common law rights. Assuming no   opposition is filed, your application will either be "allowed" (meaning you   filed an intent-to-use application and all you must do is prove that you have   begun use of the mark before a registration certificate will issue), or a   registration certificate will be sent to you. If an opposition is filed, an   administrative litigation (called an Opposition Proceeding) is   commenced.<br>

<p><strong>What does it cost to file a U.S. trademark application?</strong></p>
<p>The cost varies depending on the complexity of your application, whether you   are filing an intent-to-use application or an actual use-based application, the   types of goods or services for which you seek registration and the nature of   your mark. Generally, we charge $850, including the filing fee of $325 for a one   class application. But this estimate may be high or low depending on the details of your   application. We will give you a specific cost estimate for your application.   Just email us at <A href="mailto:info@iph2.com">info@iph2.com</A>.</p>
