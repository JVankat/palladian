<B>Bracks, Steve,</B> byname of Stephen Phillip Bracks (b. Oct. 15, 1954, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia), premier of Victoria (1999-2007).<P>

<B>Bradley, Michael (John)</B> (b. June 11, 1933, Northern Ireland - d. Feb. 22, 2010, Beckington, Somerset, England), governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands (1987-93).<P>

<A NAME="bradl"><TABLE ALIGN="Right"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="bradl.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>T. Bradley</TR></TABLE>
<B>Bradley, Tom,</B> byname of Thomas J. Bradley (b. Dec. 29, 1917, Calvert, Texas - d. Sept. 29, 1998, Los Angeles, Calif.), U.S. politician. He won a City Council seat in Los Angeles in 1963 and ran for mayor six years later, losing a bitter election tinged with racist rhetoric to Sam Yorty; the scars of the 1965 Watts riots were still fresh. In 1973, Bradley ran again and this time beat Yorty with 56% of the vote, becoming the first black mayor of Los Angeles. In 1981, Bradley, running as a Democrat, lost the governor's race to Republican George Deukmejian by less than 1 percentage point. He lost a second bid for governor in 1986. The five-term mayor (1973-93) was credited with opening city government to minorities and women, expanding social services to the urban poor, and spurring economic growth. Under his administration, Los Angeles surpassed San Francisco as the West Coast's economic power in Pacific Rim trading, symbolized by the downtown skyline that grew during his administration. The successful 1984 Olympic Games stood out as his crowning achievement. The economic ruin and traffic gridlock many feared never materialized. The low point was in 1992, when riots broke out after four white LAPD officers were acquitted in the beating of black motorist Rodney King. Bradley appealed for calm, but some said his angry denunciation of the verdicts may have provoked violence. He would later describe the violence that left 55 people dead as "the most painful experience of my life." He governed quietly, by building coalitions instead of using the bully pulpit. Beginning in 1989, Bradley became embroiled in a political scandal involving his acceptance of a fee for serving as an adviser for a bank doing business with the city. At 75, he announced his retirement, avoiding an election he probably couldn't have won.<P>

<B>Bradshaw, Robert L(lewellyn)</B> (b. Sept. 16, 1916, St. Paul's, St. Kitts - d. May 23, 1978, St. Kitts), West Indian politician. In 1940 he founded St. Kitts's trade and labour union and Labour Party. He became a member of the Legislative Council in 1946 and sat in the West Indies Federal Parliament as federal minister of finance (1958-62). When the federation dissolved, he returned to St. Kitts as minister without portfolio until 1966. After briefly serving as chief minister (1966-67), he became premier of St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla in 1967, when the three islands became an independent state in association with the U.K. He died in office. In 1998 he was posthumously awarded the Order of National Hero, giving him the title The Right Excellent Sir Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw, Knight Grand Commander of the Order of National Hero (K.G.N.H.).<P>

<A NAME="brandt"><TABLE ALIGN="Right"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="brandtw.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>W. Brandt</TR></TABLE>
<B>Brandt, Willy,</B> original name Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm (b. Dec. 18, 1913, L�beck, Germany - d. Oct. 8, 1992, Unkel, near Bonn), chancellor of West Germany (1969-74). When the Nazis came to power, his activities as a young Social Democrat brought him into conflict with the Gestapo, and he had to flee the country to escape arrest. He went to Norway (where he assumed the name Willy Brandt), and when the Germans occupied Norway he escaped to Sweden, where he remained for the duration of World War II. After the war he returned to Germany as a Norwegian citizen. Pressed to return to politics, he applied to renew his German citizenship in 1947 and was elected to the federal parliament in 1949. Later he became governing mayor of West Berlin (1957-66). He became chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 1964 and campaigned for the office of chancellor three times (1961, 1965, 1969). When the grand coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats was formed in 1966, Brandt became foreign minister and vice-chancellor. In 1969 his party formed a coalition with the small Free Democratic Party. The year following his election as chancellor, he concentrated on foreign affairs and particularly sought to improve relations with East Germany, other Communist nations in eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union, formulating a policy known as <I>Ostpolitik</I> ("eastern policy"). Although fortified by a great SPD victory in 1972, he resigned in May 1974 after his close aide G�nter Guillaume was unmasked as an East German spy. He remained SPD chairman until 1987 and was also head of the Socialist International from 1976 to 1992. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his continuing work toward reconciliation between West Germany and the Soviet bloc.<P>

<B>Brankovic, Nedzad</B> (b. Dec. 28, 1962, Visegrad [now in Republika Srpska], Bosnia and Herzegovina), prime minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2007-09).<P>

<A NAME="brannan"><TABLE ALIGN="Right"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="brann.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>Brannan</TR></TABLE>
<B>Brannan, Charles F(ranklin)</B> (b. Aug. 23, 1903, Denver, Colo. - d. July 2, 1992, Denver), U.S. secretary of agriculture (1948-53). In 1935 he became assistant regional attorney of the Resettlement Administration, and later regional attorney in the Department of Agriculture's office of the solicitor. From November 1941 to April 1944 he was regional director of the Farm Security Administration for Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. He was named assistant secretary of agriculture in June 1944 and secretary of agriculture in June 1948. In 1949 Brannan put forward the "Brannan plan" for farm price supports to be based on a minimum farm purchasing power, which would be subsidized by government payments. This legislative proposal was not enacted by Congress, although Brannan and other administration leaders continued to press for it during 1950. He charged that failure to enact his plan was the cause of such occurrences as dumping millions of dollars of surplus agricultural products which had been purchased by the government. On Aug. 22, 1950, Brannan declared that the government had huge surpluses of dairy foods and dried eggs, in danger of spoiling if not given away. Under Pres. Harry S. Truman's defense mobilization plan announced Sept. 9, 1950, Brannan was given cognizance over food, farm equipment, and commercial fertilizer.<P>

<A NAME="branst"><TABLE ALIGN="Right"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="brans.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>Branstad</TR></TABLE>
<B>Branstad, Terry E(dward)</B> (b. Nov. 17, 1946, Leland, Iowa), governor of Iowa (1983-99, 2011-&nbsp;). A Republican, he served in the Iowa House of Representatives (1973-79) and was lieutenant governor (1979-83). Benefiting from opponents' weaknesses, he won the governor's race with 53% in 1982 because his opponent had legally avoided paying her state taxes, with 52% in 1986 when his opponent backed a $400 million bond issue to be paid back from a lottery, and with 61% in 1990 against a weak winner of a multi-candidate primary. In 1994, he had primary opposition from Fred Grandy, familiar to TV viewers as Gopher in <I>The Love Boat</I>, but to Iowans as a hard-working, close-to-home congressman from the 5th District. Grandy called for a tax cut and attacked Branstad for "a pattern of abuse and mismanagement." Branstad won by only 52%-48%. In the general, Branstad never had a secure lead in polls over Attorney General Bonnie Campbell, who attacked her own party's platform as too liberal; Grandy was openly hostile, saying of Branstad, "I'll hold my nose and vote for the guy." But in the fall, with crime an issue, Branstad attacked Campbell for her opposition to the death penalty. And the strong Iowa economy evidently worked for the incumbent. Branstad won 58%-42%, carrying all but four counties. Des Moines, the most vibrantly growing part of the state, which voted against Branstad in 1982 and 1986, voted for him this time. Branstad, who had the strength to win when Iowa seemed mostly Democratic, now had the opportunity to lead when it was trending Republican. Incidentally, Branstad endorsed Bob Dole for president in 1996 - the first time he publicly endorsed a presidential candidate. In March 1997 he said he would not seek a fifth term. After a 12-year pause, however, he did so and defeated incumbent Democrat Chet Culver 53%-43% in 2010.<P>

<B>Brantsen van de Zijp, Derk Willem Gerhard Johan Hendrik baron</B> (b. March 26, 1801, Rotterdam, Netherlands - d. ...), acting governor of Gelderland (1846-47).<P>

<B>Brar, (Sardar) Harcharan Singh</B> (b. Jan. 22, 1922, Sarai Naga village, Punjab, India - d. Sept. 6, 2009, Sarai Naga), governor of Orissa (1977) and Haryana (1977-79) and chief minister of Punjab (1995-96).<P>

<B>Brasey, Louis Antoine Marie</B> (b. May 31, 1891 - d. 19...), resident-superior of Laos (1941-45).<P>

<TABLE ALIGN="Left"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="brash.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>Brash</TR></TABLE>
<B>Brash, Don(ald Thomas)</B> (b. Sept. 24, 1940, Wanganui, New Zealand), New Zealand politician. He was governor of the Reserve Bank (1988-2002) before entering parliament. In October 2003 he toppled Bill English as leader of the National Party. He was never a strong performer in the House and, although his apolitical image might initially have seemed an asset, doubts emerged about his political instincts. To the surprise of many observers, and indeed Brash himself, his Orewa speech in late January 2004 on race relations and separatism resonated strongly with the public. And he showed he had a ruthless streak in demoting the party's spokeswomen for Maori affairs (Georgina Te Heuheu) and welfare (Katherine Rich). But his political awkwardness persisted, as in his unconvincing denial of accusations in 2004 that he told United States officials that the nuclear propulsion ban would be "gone by lunchtime." In the elections of September 2005, on the back of an aggressive tax-cut policy, National gained 39% of the party vote, not enough to have a realistic chance of forming a government but a huge improvement on its miserable 21% return in the 2002 election. Just before the election Brash was placed on the back foot over alleged meetings between himself and the secretive Exclusive Brethren sect. His clumsy efforts to explain what he had or had not known about Brethren campaign pamphlets reawakened doubts about his political judgment and credibility. His gaffes became all too regular, the final straw being his handling of emails which he claimed were stolen from his computer and which were used by Nicky Hager in his book <I>The Hollow Men</I>. He resigned as leader and as MP in November 2006.<P>

<B>Brathwaite, Sir Nicholas (Alexander)</B> (b. July 8, 1925, Carriacou), prime minister of Grenada (1983-84, 1990-95); knighted 1995.<P>

<A NAME="brati"><TABLE ALIGN="Right"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="brati1.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>I.C. Bratianu</TR></TABLE>
<B>Bratianu, Ion C(onstantin)</B> (b. June 2, 1821, Pitesti, Walachia [now in Romania] - d. May 16, 1891, Florica, Romania), prime minister of Romania (1868, 1876-81, 1881-88). He took part in the revolution of 1848 and became one of the four secretaries of the provisional government. He was one of the leaders of the party that rejected the Russian protectorate and the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, aspiring instead to make of Romania an independent democratic state. Having been proscribed for his activity in the revolutionary cause, Bratianu withdrew to Paris, where he continued to work for the union and autonomy of the principalities of Moldavia and Walachia. He returned home in 1856. With the principalities subsequently united as Romania under Prince Alexandru Ioan, Bratianu founded the Romanian Liberal Party with his brother Dimitrie and in 1866 figured prominently in the deposing of Alexandru and the election as prince of Romania of Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, later (1881) King Carol I. As minister of finance, Bratianu played an important role in designing the Romanian constitution of 1866. He was arrested following an abortive antidynastic coup in 1870 but was soon released. Aided by his longtime political ally C.A. Rosetti, Bratianu formed a Liberal government in 1876 and remained prime minister until 1888, except for a brief interval in 1881 when his brother took over the post. His autocratic, corrupt administration, which was redeemed somewhat by constitutional and land reforms and by his own personal character, was also marked by Romania's alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary (1883). He was compelled to resign in 1888 after a riotous outbreak in Bucharest, which was only suppressed after bloodshed.<P>

<B>Bratianu, Ion I(on) C(onstantin),</B> byname Ionel Bratianu (b. Aug. 20, 1864, Florica, Romania - d. Nov. 24, 1927, Bucharest), interior minister (1907-08), prime minister (1909-11, 1914-18, 1918-19, 1922-26, 1927), and foreign minister (1927) of Romania; son of Ion C. Bratianu.<P>

<B>Bratianu, Vintila (Ion Constantin)</B> (b. 1867 - d. Dec. 22, 1930, Ramnicu Valcea, Romania), finance minister (1922-26, 1927-28) and prime minister (1927-28) of Romania; son of Ion C. Bratianu; brother of Ion I.C. Bratianu.<P>

<A NAME="bratt"><TABLE ALIGN="Right"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="bratt.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>Bratteli</TR></TABLE>
<B>Bratteli, Trygve (Martin)</B> (b. Jan. 11, 1910, N�tter�y, Norway - d. Nov. 20, 1984, Oslo), prime minister of Norway (1971-72, 1973-76). He joined the Labour Party and became editor (1934) of the party newspaper in Kirkenes. He was secretary (1934-40) and chairman (1945-46) of the party's youth section and edited its magazine. He remained in Norway after the German invasion (1940), joining the Resistance, but he was arrested in 1942 and spent the remainder of World War II in various concentration camps in Germany. After the war he became vice-chairman of the Labour Party (1945-65). He was elected to the Storting (parliament) in 1950 and under the premiership of Einar Gerhardsen served as finance minister (1951-55, 1956-60) and minister of transport and communications (1960-64). Bratteli succeeded as party leader in 1965, forming a minority government in March 1971. An advocate of Norwegian accession to the European Communities (EC), he resigned (October 1972) following the referendum by which EC membership was rejected. He returned to power a year later at the head of a coalition of the Labour and Socialist Alliance parties, but his defeat over the EC continued to cast a cloud over his political life, and eventually undermined his position. He resigned as chairman of the Labour Party (1975) and as prime minister (January 1976). He remained a member of parliament until 1981.<P>

<B>Brawand, Samuel</B> (b. May 18, 1898, Grindelwald, Bern, Switzerland - d. July 11, 2001, Grindelwald), president of the government of Bern (1950-51, 1961-62). He began his political career as a municipal councillor of Grindelwald. Between 1933 and 1935, he was a member of the cantonal parliament representing the Social Democratic Party. He was a member of the National Council from 1935 until he was elected as a cantonal government minister in 1947. He headed the department for construction and railways for 15 years. In 1955-67, he was a member of the National Council again.<P>

Sept. 14, 1905, Dakar, Senegal), commissioner-general of French Congo (1886-97). He became a naturalized French citizen on Aug. 12, 1874, adopting the French spelling of his name.<P>

<B>Breathitt, Edward T(hompson, Jr.),</B> byname Ned Breathitt (b. Nov. 26, 1924, Hopkinsville, Ky. - d. Oct. 14, 2003, Lexington, Ky.), governor of Kentucky (1963-67). He was elected to the Kentucky House in 1951, serving from 1952 to 1958. He worked for Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and was on the campaign staff that returned former vice president Alben Barkley to the U.S. Senate in 1954. Racial harmony was a theme of Breathitt's inaugural speech as governor on Dec. 10, 1963. But Congress was debating a civil rights bill at the time, and state lawmakers were unwilling to take the lead in enacting a state civil rights law. The Breathitt administration's bill was later killed in committee. Finally, in 1966, Kentucky became the first southern state to enact a civil rights law, which went farther than the federal law in prohibiting racial discrimination in hiring. "This is only a beginning," Breathitt said at the bill-signing ceremony. "Only in the human heart can justice win the final victory." Later governors appointed Breathitt to the Council on Higher Education and the governing boards of Morehead State University, Kentucky State University, and the University of Kentucky, where he spent seven more years as trustees chairman. He became the Southern Railway System's general counsel after leaving the governorship, moved to Washington, D.C., as a vice president in 1972 and was the company's top lobbyist for 20 years.<P>

<A NAME="breck"><TABLE ALIGN="Left"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="breck.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>Breckinridge</TR></TABLE>
<B>Breckinridge, John C(abell)</B> (b. Jan. 21, 1821, near Lexington, Ky. - d. May 17, 1875, Lexington), U.S. vice president (1857-61). He began his political career in 1849 as a member of the Kentucky legislature. In 1851 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. During this troubled antebellum period, he established his reputation as a faithful Democrat, and when his party nominated James Buchanan of Pennsylvania for president in 1856, Breckinridge was a natural choice to "balance the ticket" between North and South. Once in office, however, Buchanan and Breckinridge were unable to fend off the sectional conflict. Challenged by the newly formed Republican Party, which resisted extension of slavery into the territories, the Democrats broke apart at their national convention in the summer of 1860. The Northern wing nominated Stephen A. Douglas on a platform favouring popular sovereignty (local option), while the Southerners chose Breckinridge on a separate ticket demanding federal intervention in behalf of slave property in the territories. Defeated in the November election by Republican Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge succeeded John J. Crittenden as U.S. senator from Kentucky in March 1861, but he resigned later that year. He never ceased working for accommodation and compromise, but after the firing on Ft. Sumter, S.C. (April 12), he maintained that the Union no longer existed. He was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in November. After the Battle of Shiloh (April 6-7, 1862), in which he commanded the reserve, he was promoted to the rank of major general and thereafter took part in many campaigns. In the final months of the war, Breckinridge served as Confederate secretary of war.<P>

<B>Brenes Jarqu�n, Carlos Alberto</B> (b. Dec. 2, 1884, Masaya, Nicaragua - d. Jan. 2, 1942, Managua), acting president of Nicaragua (1936-37).<P>

<A NAME="brenn"><B>Brennan, Peter J(oseph)</B> (b. May 24, 1918, New York City - d. Oct. 2, 1996, Massapequa, Long Island, N.Y.), U.S. secretary of labor (1973-75). He served as a chief petty officer during World War II in a submarine in the Pacific, but when he returned to civilian life he quickly became more involved in union activities. In 1957, Brennan was elected president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an umbrella organization of unions with 250,000 members at the time. He was also president of the council's New York State counterpart and served as vice president of the state AFL-CIO. Brennan rose to national prominence in 1970 when he organized 100,000 construction workers to rally for Pres. Richard Nixon's policies on the Vietnam War. A counterdemonstration by Vietnam War opponents led to a clash with the workers, and many antiwar protesters were beaten. Nixon thanked Brennan for the support by inviting him to the White House and presenting him with a white hard hat stamped with an American flag and the title "Commander in Chief." The links that Nixon formed with the rank and file of traditionally Democratic unions contributed to his landslide re-election in 1972. Nixon nominated Brennan as secretary of labor not long after the election, and Brennan held the post from Feb. 2, 1973, until Pres. Gerald Ford replaced him in 1975. During his tenure, he was credited with helping strengthen pension plan safeguards and worker safety enforcement. But he clashed with AFL-CIO President George Meany on minimum wage policy. Ford offered Brennan the post of ambassador to Ireland, but Brennan declined and returned to New York, where he resumed the presidency of the construction trades council.<P>

<B>Brezhnev, Leonid (Ilich)</B> (b. Dec. 19, 1906, Kamenskoye, Russia [now Dniprodzerzhinsk, Ukraine] - d. Nov. 10, 1982, Moscow), Soviet Communist Party leader (1964-82). He became a full member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1931. By 1939 he had become secretary of the regional party committee of Dnepropetrovsk. During World War II he served as a political commissar in the Red Army. In 1950 he was sent to Moldavia as first secretary of the Moldavian Communist Party. In 1952 he became a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU and a candidate member of the Politburo, but he lost those posts after Stalin's death (March 1953). In 1955 he became first secretary of the Kazakhstan Communist Party, and in 1956 he was reelected to his posts on the CPSU Central Committee and the Politburo. A year later, Brezhnev was made a full member of the Politburo, and in 1960 he became chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (titular head of state). In July 1964 he resigned that post to become Nikita Khrushchev's assistant as second secretary of the Central Committee, by which time he was considered Khrushchev's heir apparent as party leader. Three months later, however, he helped lead the coalition that forced Khrushchev from power, and became (Oct. 15, 1964) first secretary of the CPSU (after 1966, general secretary). During the 1970s he attempted to normalize relations between West Germany and the Warsaw Pact and to ease tensions with the United States through the policy known as d�tente. He was elected chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in June 1977, thus becoming the first person in Soviet history to hold both the leadership of the party and of the state. He retained his hold on power to the end despite his frail health and growing feebleness.<P>

<A NAME="briand"><TABLE ALIGN="Right"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="brian.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>Briand</TR></TABLE>
<B>Briand, Aristide</B> (b. March 28, 1862, Nantes, France - d. March 7, 1932, Paris, France), prime minister (1909-11, 1913, 1915-17, 1921-22, 1925-26, 1929) and foreign minister (1915-17, 1921-22, 1925-26, 1926-32) of France. In 1894 he succeeded in getting the sharply divided French trade unionists to adopt the general strike as a political tactic at a workers' congress at Nantes. After three unsuccessful attempts (1889, 1893, and 1898) to be elected to the Chamber of Deputies, Briand became secretary-general of the Socialist Party in 1901. In 1902 he finally won election as a deputy from the Loire <I>d�partement</I> and remained a member of the chamber until his death. Briand's first great success in government came with his work on the commission that drafted a law of separation of church and state in 1905. This achievement led to his appointment as minister of public education and culture in March 1906, but his acceptance of a post in a bourgeois cabinet widened his break with Jean Jaur�s and other Socialists. After serving another term as education minister in the first government of Georges Clemenceau (1906-09), he became premier for the first time. His successes were the Pact of Locarno (1925), in which he, Gustav Stresemann of Germany, and Austen Chamberlain of Britain sought to normalize relations between Germany and its former enemies; and the Kellogg-Briand Pact (Aug. 27, 1928), in which 60 nations agreed to outlaw war as an instrument of national policy. His efforts for international cooperation, the League of Nations, and world peace brought him the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1926, which he shared with Stresemann. In December 1930 Briand publicly, and boldly for the times, advocated a federal union of Europe. He finally retired in January 1932, after an unsuccessful campaign for the French presidency in 1931.<P>

<B>Brittan of Spennithorne, Leon Brittan, Baron</B> (b. Sept. 25, 1939, London), British politician. After two unsuccessful attempts to enter Parliament he became member for the Yorkshire constituency of Cleveland and Whitby in 1974. He was appointed minister of state at the Home Office when the Conservatives won power in 1979. Two years later he joined the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury. He was the youngest member of the cabinet formed after the June 1983 election. Appointed home secretary at the age of 43, he was the youngest to hold that office since Winston Churchill in 1910-11. He found himself somewhat uneasily poised between the reformist tradition of the old Conservative Party and the monetarists of the new right. In economics he was a convinced monetarist; as home secretary his instincts were for humane and rational reforms, which set him apart from the simplistic prejudices of some of the Tory right wing. Nevertheless, when the Commons debated (and rejected) restoration of capital punishment, favoured by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher among other Conservatives, his equivocal stance disappointed abolitionists. In 1985 he was appointed secretary of state for trade and industry. After four months, however, he was forced to resign. He was engaged in a battle with Michael Heseltine, the defense secretary, over a small, ailing helicopter company, Westland PLC. The issue was trivial but was inflated into a row that at one point threatened Thatcher's government. Heseltine was forced to resign in January 1986 - followed later that month by Brittan's resignation. On Thatcher's nomination he was knighted (1989) and became a member (1989-99) and a vice president (1989-93, 1995-99) of the European Commission. In 2000 he was created a life peer.<P>

<B>Brizola, Leonel (de Moura)</B> (b. Jan. 22, 1922, Carazinho, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil - d. June 21, 2004, Rio de Janeiro), governor of Rio Grande do Sul (1959-63) and Rio de Janeiro (1983-87, 1991-94); brother-in-law of Jo�o Goulart. In 1947 he won a seat in the Rio Grande do Sul state legislature for the Brazilian Labor Party, which he had joined two years earlier. He rose quickly through the party ranks and in 1954 was elected to the federal congress. One year later he was elected mayor of Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. In 1958 he won the state's gubernatorial race and during his four-year tenure expropriated - without compensation - U.S.-owned utility companies. In 1962 he was again elected to the lower house Chamber of Deputies, this time for the state of Guanabara (now part of Rio de Janeiro). In 1964, the armed forces overthrew leftist president Goulart; he and Brizola went into exile. Brizola, one of Brazil's most skilled public speakers, was widely viewed as Goulart's successor in the presidential elections scheduled for 1965, and some observers said he was the real target of the coup, which ushered in a military dictatorship that lasted 21 years. Brizola organized the so-called "Groups of 11," armed cells designed to resist the dictatorship. After living in Uruguay, the U.S., and Portugal, he returned to Brazil in 1979, when Pres. Jo�o Figueiredo signed an amnesty law. He quickly returned to politics, founding the Democratic Labor Party and getting elected as governor of Rio de Janeiro in 1982 and 1990. He ran for president in 1989, but was narrowly edged out from the runoff by Luiz In�cio Lula da Silva. Brizola took another stab at the presidency in 1994 and lost and in 1998 was Lula's running mate in an election won by Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He ran for mayor of Rio de Janeiro in 2000 but got just 9% of the vote.<P>

In 1894 he entered the diplomatic service and in 1909 he was appointed consul-general at Budapest. As German minister in Copenhagen (1912-18), he supported the Danish policy of neutrality during World War I and was able to maintain German-Danish trade. In the later stages of the war he was widely regarded as the coming leader of German foreign policy, but his services were not called upon until, after the collapse, he was appointed foreign minister in the revolutionary government in December 1918, a post in which he was confirmed when, after the meeting of the National Assembly at Weimar in February 1919, the first republican government emerged. At the Paris peace conference he argued in vain for better conditions of peace for Germany. Unable to dissuade his government from ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, he resigned his post as foreign minister in June 1919. In 1922 he became the first German ambassador to the Soviet Union, where he and Soviet statesman Georgy Chicherin worked to consolidate the German-Soviet rapprochement inaugurated by the Treaty of Rapallo. The German-Soviet Treaty of Berlin (April 1926) counterbalanced the Locarno Pact of 1925, which had seemed to link Germany too closely with the Western powers.<P>

<B>Brooke of Cumnor, Henry Brooke, Baron</B> (b. April 9, 1903, Oxford, England - d. March 29, 1984, Mildenhall, Wiltshire, England), British politician. He entered Parliament in 1938 as a Conservative. He lost his seat in 1945 but was later adopted as candidate for Hampstead, returned to the House of Commons in 1950, and remained there until 1966, when he was made a life peer. Brooke's first ministerial appointment was in 1954, when he became financial secretary to the Treasury, and three years later he joined the cabinet as minister of housing and local government. There he was responsible for carrying through his predecessor's Rent Bill which was strongly criticized as being biased against tenants and in favour of landlords. In 1961 Brooke assumed the newly created post of chief secretary to the Treasury and a year later became home secretary (1962-64). A hard-liner, he was a controversial figure who had to face strong opposition in Parliament, where his debating skills were not always effective. His decision to deport Chief Anthony Enahoro to face a treason charge in Nigeria, and his attitude on immigration made him the target of attack by liberals. Defeated in the 1966 general election, he later took an active role in the House of Lords. He was made a privy councillor in 1955 and a Companion of Honour in 1964.<P>

After Brooks left the Senate in 1948, the couple moved to Chicago. She became an Illinois Republican National Committee woman and in 1960 was elected vice chairwoman of the National Committee. In 1963, she returned to Idaho where she was appointed to the state Senate. She returned to Washington in 1969 after she was chosen U.S. Mint director by Pres. Richard Nixon.

<B>Brown, Edmund G(erald),</B> byname Pat Brown (b. April 21, 1905, San Francisco, Calif. - d. Feb. 16, 1996, Beverly Hills, Calif.), U.S. politician. As two-term governor of California (1959-67) he was credited with helping facilitate the rapid growth of the nation's most populous state by shepherding the expansion of its roads, public universities and water supply. He also instituted civil rights laws and consumer-protection measures. Brown retired from politics after losing a bid for a third term to Ronald Reagan. His son Edmund G., Jr., was also governor of California. Daughter Kathleen Brown was state treasurer and made her own unsuccessful run for governor in 1994.<P>

<B>Brown, (James) Gordon</B> (b. Feb. 20, 1951, Glasgow, Scotland), British prime minister (2007-10). In 1974 he helped organize the campaign to elect Robin Cook to Parliament. By the time the two men entered the cabinet together 23 years later (with Cook as foreign secretary), they had become rivals. Their hostility dated from the ill-fated 1979 campaign for limited self-government for Scotland, when they fought on opposite sides - Brown supporting a "yes" vote in that year's referendum, and Cook opting for "no." (In 1998, after a successful vote on devolution, Brown campaigned against the extreme Scottish Nationalists.) Brown entered Parliament in 1983 for Dunfermline East, an industrial constituency near Glasgow. He became friends with Tony Blair, another new MP, and the two soon found themselves at the forefront of the campaign to modernize Labour's political philosophy, replacing the dream of state socialism with a more pragmatic, market-friendly strategy. Brown, two years older than Blair, was widely regarded as the senior half of the partnership and the one more likely eventually to become party leader. By the time leader John Smith died in 1994, however, Blair had overtaken Brown as the favoured candidate of party activists and the wider public. Brown reluctantly agreed to step aside and allow Blair to run as the "modernizer" candidate. After Blair won, he reappointed Brown shadow chancellor of the exchequer (a post that Smith had first given him two years earlier). Labour's landslide victory in the 1997 general election propelled Brown into the treasury, where he immediately made his mark by ceding the power to set interest rates to the Bank of England. Brown swiftly established himself as the cabinet's second most important member. When Blair announced his resignation in 2007, Brown emerged as the uncontested successor. After losing 91 seats in the 2010 general election, he quit as Labour leader.<P>

<B>Brown, Jesse</B> (b. March 27, 1944, Detroit, Mich. - d. Aug. 15, 2002, Warrenton, Va.), U.S. veterans affairs secretary (1993-97). In 1963 he enlisted in the Marines and two years later he was seriously wounded while on patrol in Da Nang, Vietnam. That injury left his right arm partially paralyzed and became the motivating factor for his life's work. In 1967 he returned to Chicago to work for Disabled American Veterans, a 1.4 million-member advocacy group for vets with service-connected disabilities. He moved to DAV headquarters in 1973. In 1988 he became its executive director. He became a familiar figure on Capitol Hill, pushing Congress to support legislation ensuring that veterans receive their entitled health care services and benefits programs. He was appointed veterans affairs secretary by Pres. Bill Clinton in January 1993 - an ideal choice for Clinton, who was distrusted by many in the military because of his efforts to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War and other issues. In Brown, one of four blacks in the original Clinton cabinet, veterans groups knew they had a man who would stand up for their interests. Brown opposed proposals to reduce some veterans' benefits as a way to help cut the federal budget deficit. The savings "would be used to pay for the out-of-control expenses of Medicaid and Medicare programs," he wrote in November 1992. "Can you imagine cutting the compensation of a 100% disabled veteran to pay for free medical care under Medicaid for persons who have made no contributions to their country's service?" He also accused pharmaceutical companies of "gouging" the VA on drug purchases. "It's a moral outrage that drug companies are lining their pockets with money Congress intended for direct medical care to America's disabled veterans," he wrote.<P>

<B>Brown, Ron(ald Harmon)</B> (b. Aug. 1, 1941, Washington, D.C. - d. April 3, 1996, near Dubrovnik, Croatia), U.S. secretary of commerce (1993-96). In 1971 Brown was elected district leader of the Democratic Party in Mount Vernon, N.Y. In 1972 the Urban League sent him to Washington as its spokesman, and by 1978 he held the position of vice president of the Urban League's Washington operations. The following year he became deputy manager of the presidential campaign of Sen. Edward Kennedy (Dem., Mass.). In 1980 Brown was named chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1982 he became deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). For three months in 1988 Brown worked in Rev. Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign, serving as its manager at the Democratic national convention. Five months after the convention Paul G. Kirk, Jr., announced that he would not seek a second term as DNC chairman. Brown decided to run, and in the final week of January 1989 he had gained enough significant endorsements to persuade his opponents to withdraw from the race, and on February 10 he was elected by acclamation and became the first African-American to head one of the two major political parties. He tried to dispel the perception that he would fuel an image of liberalism that many in the party wanted to combat. His skill at mediating among political factions is widely credited with uniting Democrats behind Bill Clinton in 1992. A prominent member of Clinton's cabinet, he wielded heavy influence in international trade but was criticized for alleged misdealings in his personal finances. Traveling widely, he secured trading partners in emerging nations. He was on such a trip when he was killed in a plane crash along with a score of U.S. corporate executives.<P>

After serving in the British army during World War I, he entered the Australian Parliament as a Nationalist in a by-election in 1918 and was his country's representative to the League of Nations in 1921. After serving as federal treasurer from 1921 to 1923, he became prime minister upon the resignation of William Morris Hughes, forming a coalition of the National and Country parties. He was also minister of external affairs and at times took the portfolios of health, trade and customs, and the territories. During his administration, Bruce strove to develop the Australian economy, especially by integrating it with that of Great Britain. He fostered research in public health and applied science. His government was returned with a comfortable majority in 1925 but in 1929 it was defeated, and he himself lost his seat. In 1931 he regained his seat and served as minister without portfolio. As Australia's minister to England in 1932 and Australian high commissioner from 1933 to 1945, he successfully lobbied for the lowering of interest rates for Australia during the Great Depression. As the Australian representative to the British war cabinet from 1942 to 1945, he opposed British prime minister Winston Churchill in arguing for lenient postwar treatment of Germany. In 1947 he became chairman of Britain's Finance Corporation for Industry, which contributed to postwar recovery in Britain. In 1947-51 he was also chairman of the World Food Council. Awarded a viscountcy in 1947, he was the first Australian to be so honoured. There were no children from his marriage, and the viscountcy lapsed.<P>

<B>Brucker, Wilber M(arion)</B> (b. June 23, 1894, Saginaw, Mich. - d. Dec. 28, 1968, Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich.), governor of Michigan (1931-33) and U.S. secretary of the Army (1955-61). He served with the U.S. National Guard in the Mexican expedition of 1916 and was an infantry officer with the American expeditionary forces in World War I, receiving the silver star. From 1923 to 1927 he was prosecuting attorney for Saginaw county and from 1927 to 1928 assistant attorney general of Michigan; in 1928 he became attorney general of the state, serving until 1930. A Republican, he was elected governor of Michigan in 1930 but was defeated for reelection in 1932. He was a candidate for U.S. senator from Michigan in 1936. In April 1954, Brucker was nominated general counsel of the federal Department of Defense. When Robert T. Stevens resigned as secretary of the army, Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower on June 22, 1955, nominated Brucker to succeed him in that office. In 1957 he was in charge of the deployment of federal troops ordered by Eisenhower to halt obstruction of school integration in Little Rock, Ark. Brucker opposed moves, including those of the Eisenhower administration, to reduce the size of the army while he was in office. In June 1958 he expressed disagreement with the administration's proposal to cut army personnel to 870,000, but said he would bow to the "decision of ... superiors." Congress voted to fix army manpower at 900,000. In late August he held conferences with Gen. Chiang Kai-shek at Taipei, Taiwan, on defense against Red China's threatened invasion of Quemoy and other Nationalist-held islands in Formosa Strait.<P>

In September 1974, she was invited to become environment minister in the Labour government. In October 1979 she left that job to become deputy chairman of Labour's parliamentary group and chairman of the important Foreign Affairs Committee of the Storting (parliament). She made history in February 1981 when she became Norway's first woman prime minister and the first woman to lead its largest political party. Her first spell in office was brief. She replaced Odvar Nordli, forced to retire by ill health, at a time when Labour was split on many issues, its fortunes fading, and parliamentary elections only seven months away. Under her firm leadership, party unity improved, but there was too much ground to be made up in the opinion polls, and in the September 1981 elections Labour lost office. She started her second stint as prime minister in May 1986, following the resignation of the Conservative-led minority coalition. Again she faced serious problems on taking office. The collapse of world petroleum prices had removed the main support of Norway's prosperity, with disastrous consequences for both government revenues and the balance of trade. She warned that austerity was "an inadequate term for the vast economic restructuring" that the country needed. Labour, she added, would have to discard the program of expansion on which it had campaigned half a year earlier, before the oil price slide. The cabinet she appointed was radical in only two respects - it contained a record number of women (8 out of 18), and its members had an average age of only 46.5 years. She resigned as leader of the Labour Party in 1992 and as prime minister in 1996. In 1998-2003 she was director-general of the World Health Organization.<P>

He was a member of the (Catholic) Centre Party and from 1924 represented Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) in the Reichstag (lower house). He came to be known as a financial and economic expert, and in 1929 he became the leader of his party in the Reichstag. Upon the fall of the coalition government of the Social Democrat Hermann M�ller, Br�ning was called on to form a new, more conservative ministry on March 28, 1930, without a Reichstag majority. His policies, formed in response to the Great Depression, involved increased taxation, reduced government expenditure, and high tariffs on foreign agricultural products. His austerity measures prevented any renewal of inflation, but they also paralyzed the economy and resulted in skyrocketing unemployment and a drastic fall in German workers' standard of living. On July 16, 1930, after the Reichstag rejected a major part of his plans, he began governing by presidential emergency decree, using Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution as a basis for this step. On July 18 he dissolved the Reichstag, which returned after new elections in September 1930 with Nazi representation greatly increased. To accommodate this shift to the right, he enacted a more nationalistic foreign policy. In October 1931, he took over the foreign ministry while retaining the chancellorship. He helped Pres. Paul von Hindenburg win reelection in the spring of 1932, but on May 30 of that year Br�ning resigned when his project to partition several bankrupt East Elbian estates was considered Bolshevism by Hindenburg, himself an eastern landowner. Br�ning left Germany in 1934 and ultimately ended up in the United States.<P>

He was a parliamentary secretary in the government of Liam Cosgrave (1973-77) and was made finance minister under Garret FitzGerald in 1981. His budget proposal to impose a value-added tax on children's shoes led to the fall of the government in 1982. He also served as minister for industry and energy (1982-83), as minister for industry, trade, commerce, and tourism (1983-86), and again as minister for finance (1986-87). A controversial budget submitted by Bruton in 1987 was an important factor in the fall of the FitzGerald government. In 1990 Bruton was named to succeed FitzGerald as leader of the Fine Gael. He returned his party to power in December 1994 by forming a coalition government with the Labour Party and the Democratic Left Party, after the collapse of Albert Reynolds' Fianna F�il-Labour government. He pledged himself to the continuation of the Anglo-Irish peace process as pursued by his predecessor.

<B>Bryan, William Jennings</B> (b. March 19, 1860, Salem, Ill. - d. July 26, 1925, Dayton, Tenn.), U.S. presidential candidate (1896, 1900, 1908). From Lincoln, Neb., the Democrat was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1890. Renowned as a gifted debater, he came to be considered the national leader of the Free Silver Movement (bimetallism) as opposed to the "hard money" policy of the Eastern bankers and industrialists, who favoured the gold standard. Defeated for the U.S. Senate in 1894, the climax of Bryan's career was undoubtedly the 1896 presidential campaign. At the Democratic convention in Chicago, his famous "Cross of Gold" speech (July 8) won him the nomination at the age of 36. His panacea for the depressed economy after the Panic of 1893 was an "easy money" policy based on the unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio to gold of 16 to 1. In the ensuing campaign, he travelled more than 18,000 miles and attracted a large and enthusiastic following, but the well-financed Republican machine won 271 electoral votes for William McKinley, to Bryan's 176. Bryan lost to McKinley again in 1900 and to William Howard Taft in 1908. In recognition of his role in securing the Democratic nomination for Woodrow Wilson in 1912, Bryan was appointed secretary of state the following year. An avowed pacifist, Bryan resigned over Wilson's second note to Germany (June 8, 1915) protesting the sinking of the <I>Lusitania</I>. Nonetheless, he urged loyal support of the war when it was finally declared. A firm believer in a literal interpretation of the Bible, Bryan went to Dayton, Tenn., to assist in the prosecution of a schoolteacher accused of teaching Darwinism (July 1925). Soon after the trial, Bryan fell ill and died.<P>

<B>Bryant, (Cecil) Farris</B> (b. July 26, 1914, Ocala, Fla. - d. March 1, 2002, Jacksonville, Fla.), governor of Florida (1961-65). In 1946 he won his first term in the Florida legislature as a representative from Marion County and went on to serve five terms in the legislature, including one term in 1953 as speaker of the House. Elected governor in 1960, he urged expansion of the higher education system so Florida residents could win high-tech jobs beginning to locate in the Orlando-Cape Canaveral area around the burgeoning space program. With a rapidly growing population and the emergence of Florida as a major state for tourism, Bryant also concentrated on expansion of the state highway system. Although elected on a conservative segregation platform, his administration witnessed the rapid desegregation of Florida's public schools and the integration of public accommodations. In 1966, he was appointed by Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson as director of the Office of Emergency Planning and a member of the National Security Council. In 1967, Johnson named Bryant chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernment Relations. Bryant was defeated in 1970 by Lawton Chiles in a Democratic runoff for the U.S. Senate.<P>

<B>Bucaram (Elmhalim), Asaad,</B> Asaad also spelled Assad (b. 1916 - d. Nov. 5, 1981, Guayaquil, Ecuador), Ecuadorian politician. He was twice elected mayor of Guayaquil in the 1960s and later prefect of Guayas province. In 1970 he was deported to Panama. He returned in January 1972. In 1978 an electoral law laid down that presidential candidates must be of Ecuadorian parentage, thus excluding Bucaram, who was of Lebanese parentage but had been widely favoured to win the election. Jaime Rold�s Aguilera then stood in for him as candidate of the Concentration of Popular Forces. Rold�s won, but differences arose between the two, and Bucaram then obstructed Rold�s in Congress, forming an alliance with the Conservative Party to pass a series of controversial bills, many of which were, however, vetoed by Rold�s. Bucaram sprinkled his speeches with such rough language that political opponents called him a "churl" and "the sewer that talks." His followers responded that he was "a churl with a noble heart."<P>

<B>Bucaram Ortiz, Abdal� (Jaime)</B><SMALL><SUP>1</SUP></SMALL> (b. Feb. 20, 1952, Guayaquil, Ecuador), president of Ecuador (1996-97); nephew of Asaad Bucaram. In 1982 he founded the leftist Ecuadorian Roldosist Party, and two years later he was elected mayor of Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city. In 1985 he said that the military was good only for marching in parades, which resulted in a warrant for his arrest. To escape the slander charges, he fled to Panama, where he was arrested for cocaine possession but was not convicted. He claimed that rivals had planted the drugs on him. In 1987 he was allowed to return to Ecuador, but another two-year exile from criminal charges came in 1988 when he was accused of misappropriating public funds while serving as Guayaquil's mayor. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 1988 and 1992, but won a surprisingly large number of votes. Campaigning in 1996 under the name El Loco ("The Madman"), he traveled with a rock band, often singing "Jailhouse Rock," a song associated with Elvis Presley, before his speeches. He criticized the "oligarchy," which he defined as wealthy businesses and banks, and campaigned for social welfare programs and the construction of new housing. In a country where 67% of the people were poor, it was a popular platform. In the May 19 election, Bucaram and Jaime Nebot of the Social Christian Party qualified for a runoff. Nebot, who was supported by businesses and banks, was favoured to win, but Bucaram's promise of change galvanized much of the electorate, and he won the July 7 runoff with 54.5% of the votes. But after six months in office, parliament deposed him for "mental incapacity" on Feb. 6, 1997; two days later, he again fled to Panama, which granted him political asylum. The government of Pres. Fabi�n Alarc�n filed lawsuits against Bucaram for alleged mishandling and illegal appropriation of public funds. The Supreme Court cleared him of the charges on March 31, 2005, and he returned from his exile on April 2.<BR>

<B>Buchanan, James</B> (b. April 23, 1791, near Mercersburg, Pa. - d. June 1, 1868, near Lancaster, Pa.), president of the United States (1857-61). As a Federalist, Buchanan served in the Pennsylvania legislature (1814-16) and in the U.S. House of Representatives (1821-31). When his party disintegrated in the 1820s, Buchanan associated himself with the emerging Democratic Party. He served as U.S. minister to St. Petersburg (1831-33), U.S. senator (1834-45), and secretary of state (1845-49) in the cabinet of Pres. James K. Polk. Failing to receive the presidential nomination in 1848, Buchanan retired from public service until 1853, when he was appointed minister to Great Britain. He was nominated for president in 1856 and was elected over Republican John C. Fr�mont and Millard Fillmore, the American (Know-Nothing) Party candidate. Although well endowed with legal knowledge and experience in government, Buchanan lacked the soundness of judgment and moral courage to deal effectively with the slavery crisis. His strategy for the preservation of the Union consisted in the prevention of Northern antislavery agitation and the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act (1850). His position was weakened by a split within the Democratic Party, which opened the way for the election of the Republican Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860. By February 1861 seven Southern states had seceded from the Union. Buchanan denounced secession but admitted that he could find no means to stop it. The president refused to surrender any of the federal forts that he could hold, however, and he ordered reinforcements (January 1861) sent to Fort Sumter at Charleston, S.C. Upon leaving office (March 4), Buchanan retired to his home near Lancaster, where he actively supported the Union cause until his death.<P>

He joined Napol�on's imperial guard in 1804, with which he took part in the Austerlitz campaign of the following year. He later distinguished himself during the Peninsular War. At the First Restoration (1814) he was made a colonel, but his troops forced him to side with Napol�on during the Hundred Days (1815). For fifteen years after the fall of Napol�on he was not re-employed, but the July Revolution of 1830 allowed him to resume his military career. Sent to Algeria for a short period in 1836, Bugeaud defeated Abd-el-Kader, emir of Mascara and hero of the Arab resistance, at Sikkah (July 6). Critical of the traditional cumbersome French military tactics used in Algeria, Bugeaud successfully developed techniques more suited to conditions of irregular warfare. In 1841, when he returned to Algeria as governor-general, his new tactics won early successes over the Algerians. In 1843 he was made a marshal of France. After crushing Abd-el-Kader's Moroccan allies at the Battle of Isly (Aug. 14, 1844), Bugeaud received his ducal title. He returned to Algeria for short periods in 1845 and 1847 but resigned as governor-general in September 1847 in protest over the government's neglect of his plans for military colonization. When revolution broke out in Paris in 1848, Bugeaud commanded Louis-Philippe's troops in the city but failed to save the monarchy. He was asked, but eventually refused, to be a candidate for the presidency in opposition to Louis-Napol�on. Under the Second Republic he published many antisocialist pamphlets and accepted command of the Army of the Alps.<P>

He was the hereditary ruler of the Bugti tribe and an articulate spokesman for the Baloch cause for decades. The Baloch rebellion has been running off-and-on for decades, but Bugti was not always an anti-establishment figure. He was appointed governor of Balochistan in 1973, but resigned after a few months after disagreeing with federal government policies. In 1989, he was elected the province's chief minister; little more than a year later he again resigned. On other occasions he was elected as lawmaker. Hostilities escalated again in December 2005 when militants fired rockets that landed about 300 yards from Pres. Pervez Musharraf while he was visiting the town of Kohlu. The government then launched an offensive against the Bugti and Marri tribes, and Bugti was killed by security forces in a 2006 operation.<P>

The UPM coalition with the Labour Party came to an end on Jan. 2, 1924, but Buhagiar led a minority government until Parliament was dissolved in April. After the June 1924 elections, the UPM returned only 10 members to the Legislative Assembly but Buhagiar was still asked to form a government. He led a minority government until Sept. 22, 1924, when he resigned his seat and was appointed a judge of the Superior Courts.

<B>Buhari, Muhammadu</B> (b. Dec. 17, 1942, Dumurkol, Katsina state, Nigeria), president of Nigeria (1983-85). He was a Fulani from Daura in the northern state of Kaduna. He joined the Nigerian Army in 1962 and was commissioned in 1963. By 1975 he was a lieutenant colonel and was one of the movers in the coup that ousted Gen. Yakubu Gowon, head of the military government from 1966 to 1975. Buhari served as military governor of the former North Eastern state (at Maiduguri) in 1975-76 and briefly of Borno state (1976) before he was appointed federal commissioner for petroleum resources by Lieut.Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who succeeded Brig. Murtala Mohammed after the latter's assassination. When this office joined the Nigerian National Oil Corporation to form the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in 1977, Buhari became chairman. At the same time, he was moved to the job of military secretary (Army) at Supreme Military Headquarters - the seat of the government. In 1979 he returned to full military duties and in 1980 was appointed general officer commanding, 4th Division; later he became general officer commanding, 1st Mechanized Division at Jos, Plateau state, where he remained until December 1983. On the last day of 1983 the Nigerian Army once more took power, ousting the civilian government elected less than four months earlier, and Major General Buhari emerged as the new head of state. During his New Year's broadcast as head of state, he listed the many failings of former president Alhaji Shehu Shagari's regime - corruption, immorality and impropriety, forgery, fraud, embezzlement, and other crimes - and thereby set high standards for himself and his new government. In 1985 he was deposed by Ibrahim Babangida. In 2003, 2007, and 2011 he was an unsuccessful presidential candidate.<P>

He was a member of the coalition government formed in 1940 during the German occupation. A determined opponent of Denmark's forced adherence to the renewed Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941, Buhl became prime minister on Stauning's death in May 1942.

In 1926 he succeeded Grigory Zinovyev as chairman of the Comintern's executive committee. In 1928 Stalin denounced Bukharin for opposing enforced collectivization. Bukharin lost his Comintern post in April 1929 and was expelled from the Politburo in November. He recanted his views and was partially reinstated in the party. He was made editor of <I>Izvestiya</I>, the official government newspaper, in 1934 and participated in writing the 1936 Soviet constitution. But in January 1937 he was secretly arrested and was expelled from the Communist Party for being a "Trotskyite."

<B>Bulganin, Nikolay (Aleksandrovich)</B> (b. May 30 [June 11, New Style], 1895, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia - d. Feb. 24, 1975, Moscow), premier of the Soviet Union (1955-58). In 1917 he joined the Bolshevik party. In 1918-22 he held a leading post in the Cheka (secret police). He was made chairman of the Moscow Soviet in 1931 and was mayor of Moscow in 1931-37. He then became premier of the Russian S.F.S.R. (1937-38), chairman of the Soviet Union's state bank (1938-41), deputy premier of the Soviet Union (1938-41), and a full member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (1939). After serving in Iosif Stalin's elite war cabinet, the State Defense Committee (1944), he resumed the post of deputy premier of the Soviet Union (1947-49), succeeded Stalin as minister of the armed forces (1947-49), with the rank of marshal of the Soviet Union, and became a full member of the Politburo of the Central Committee (1948). After Stalin's death (March 5, 1953), he became deputy premier and defense minister in the government of Georgy Malenkov. But during the power struggle between Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev, Bulganin supported Khrushchev. Khrushchev won, and Bulganin on Feb. 8, 1955, replaced Malenkov as chairman of the Council of Ministers (premier). He came to be closely identified with Khrushchev, but he joined an "antiparty group" trying to oust Khrushchev in June 1957. Although the group failed and its leaders were expelled from the Central Committee and its Presidium (July 1957), Bulganin remained premier until March 27, 1958, and a member of the Presidium until Sept. 5, 1958; only at the end of 1958 was he formally associated with the "antiparty" group. He was then given an obscure party position, and in 1961 he lost his membership on the Central Committee.<P>

<B>Bulnes (Prieto), Manuel</B> (b. Dec. 25, 1799, Concepci�n, Chile - d. Oct. 18, 1866, Santiago), president of Chile (1841-51). His military victory against the Bolivian-Peruvian Confederation in 1839 assured his election to the presidency. He reduced the size of the military and solidified its loyalty to the central government in the face of provincial uprisings. As a southerner, he was able to defuse regional resentment of the dominant Santiago area. Although Bulnes staffed his two administrations mainly with Conservatives, he conciliated his opponents by including some Liberals. Social and political stability made Chile a haven for many intellectual refugees from other dictatorships. The new interest in learning produced a generation of young intellectuals who openly opposed the oligarchical domination that Bulnes represented. Faced with growing discontent, Bulnes named his successor, Manuel Montt, and had him duly elected; he was obliged, however, to resort to military action to quell a brief but bitter civil war before Montt's tenure was secured.<P>

<B>B�low, Bernhard (Heinrich Martin Karl) F�rst von</B>, formerly (Sept. 22, 1899-Sept. 6, 1905) Bernhard Graf von B�low (b. May 3, 1849, Klein-Flottbek, near Altona, Germany - d. Oct. 28, 1929, Rome), chancellor of Germany and prime minister of Prussia (1900-09). He entered the German foreign service in 1874. He held a number of diplomatic posts, becoming German ambassador in Rome in 1893. His real rise to power occurred in June 1897, when Emperor Wilhelm II appointed him state secretary for the Foreign Department. He quickly became a more potent force than the chancellor, Chlodwig F�rst zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsf�rst, and after three years he succeeded to the chancellorship. He was expected to satisfy the widespread desire for an aggressive foreign policy while preventing the impetuous emperor from making a fool of himself. In his foreign policy, he employed what he understood as Bismarckian <I>Realpolitik</I> to advance Wilhelm II's policy of a "place in the sun" for the Reich among world powers. As state secretary, he scored some gains in the Pacific, acquiring Kiaochow, China; the Caroline Islands; and Samoa (1897-1900). He actively promoted building the Baghdad Railway to make Germany a power in the Middle East. In domestic affairs he relied on the support of the Conservatives and Centrists and, at times, the National Liberals. Though he did not repress the Social Democrats, he made sure that they gained no real political power. Wilhelm II's indiscreet remarks printed in <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> of London in 1908 led to B�low's resignation in 1909. B�low admitted that he had not read the proof of the article that the newspaper had submitted to him before publication; Wilhelm believed B�low had approved the article so that the emperor would be humiliated.<P>

<B>Burford, Anne (Irene McGill) Gorsuch,</B> <I>n�e</I> McGill, before second marriage (1983) known as Anne M. Gorsuch (b. April 21, 1942, Casper, Wyo. - d. July 18, 2004, Aurora, Colo.), administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1981-83). In 1976, she was elected to the first of two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a member of a group that called itself the Crazies for its members' passionate devotion to states' rights and opposition to federal energy and environmental policies. She was named outstanding freshman legislator and worked on legislation concerning hazardous wastes and vehicle emissions. In appointing her EPA administrator, Pres. Ronald Reagan made her a leader in his effort to bring economic discipline to environmental cleanup and to give the states greater enforcement powers on matters like clean air and water. Critics contended that the policies weakened federal environmental enforcement to please polluting industries. This fundamental difference in perspective reached a climax in a battle between a subcommittee of the House of Representatives, which demanded thousands of pages of documents relating to toxic waste cleanup, and Gorsuch, who refused to hand them over. She said she would go to jail rather than surrender them to Congress. Eventually, the White House gave up its claim of executive privilege to keep the documents secret, and she resigned on March 9, 1983. She was the second-ranking woman in the Reagan administration, after United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. Environmentalists like Gaylord Nelson, chairman of the Wilderness Society, accused her of "a wholesale dismantling" of environmental advances, but she insisted that she was bringing cost-effective market forces to the regulation of pollution.<P>

<B>Burg, Josef (Salomon)</B> (b. Jan. 31, 1909, Dresden, Germany - d. Oct. 15, 1999, Jerusalem), Israeli politician. He arrived in British-mandated Palestine just before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. An ordained rabbi, he became a political kingmaker during his 35 years as a cabinet minister (1951-86). He spent some 40 years in parliament after Israel's establishment in 1948 and at various times held the health, posts, welfare, interior, police, and religious affairs portfolios in the cabinet. He served under every Israeli prime minister until his retirement from politics in 1986. To many Israelis, Burg, who never lost his heavy German accent, symbolized the Ashkenazi elite of European Jews who long dominated politics in the Jewish state. He was a founding member (1956) of the National Religious Party (Mafdal), which spearheaded Jewish settlement efforts in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, areas Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Burg, however, was widely regarded as a dove among hawks in the party. After Israel's 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, Burg led a Palestinian Autonomy Committee that failed to make progress on self-rule, later established under a 1993 interim peace deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.<P>

<B>Burgess, Harry</B> (b. Feb. 22, 1872, Starkville, Miss. - d. March 18, 1933), governor of the Panama Canal Zone (1928-32). He served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers advancing in rank to colonel on July 1, 1920. He was in charge of surveys and design of Muscle Shoals power development and Panama Canal maintenance engineer from 1924 to 1928. During his term as governor, canal traffic increased in volume rapidly and steadily until it reached a peak in 1929. This emphasized the need, foreseen by his predecessor Meriwether L. Walker, of providing for a greater future traffic, and much of Governor Burgess' efforts were directed toward this end. Following Walker's lead, he saw that substantial preliminary work was done toward increasing canal capacity, namely, that of constructing a dam for impounding additional water storage for lockages and maintenance of an optimal water level in Gatun Lake. Governor Burgess took great interest in the lives of the people who carried out the work of canal operations and maintenance, and undoubtedly identified more closely with the workers than they themselves realized. For example, he worked hard for, and was largely instrumental in, obtaining the rights of the Canal Zone Retirement Act, which affected favourably every employee of the "Big Ditch." Burgess also planned the construction of school buildings, bachelors and nurses quarters and established a public library and the Canal Zone Junior College. Unlike Walker, he was inclined to be impatient with details, but saw to it that every problem put to him had been well studied and carefully analyzed then acted with quick decision and sound judgment.<P>

Aug. 6, 1985, Georgetown, Guyana), prime minister (1964-80) and president (1980-85) of Guyana (until 1966, British Guiana). In 1950 he formed the People's Progressive Party together with Cheddi Jagan, the left-wing labour leader. Burnham split with Jagan in 1955 to form the more moderate People's National Congress. After Jagan's party won control of the colonial legislature in two successive elections (1957 and 1961), the British, acting to halt the leftward momentum of the government under Jagan, changed the constitution in 1964 so that Burnham could form a coalition government with a small right-wing party. When Guyana became independent in May 1966, Burnham was well established as the new state's first head of government. Until 1970, Burnham steered a moderate course, seeking foreign investment and keeping his distance from Cuba and the Socialist countries. In 1970, however, he veered sharply to the left, declaring Guyana a "Cooperative Republic," establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba, the Soviet Union, and other Communist countries, and seeking a position of leadership among Third World nations. In a referendum held in July 1978 and with electoral results widely believed to have been fraudulent, Burnham sought to strengthen his party's nearly total control of the government. By 1979 his policies of nationalization had reduced the private sector's share in the economy to 10%. In 1980 a constitutional change replaced the premiership with a more powerful presidency, and Burnham was declared the winner of the presidential election of 1980 (which was also internationally condemned as fraudulent). He died in office.<P>

Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisers. A pragmatist, Burns shifted his policy from advocating tight money to doubling the money supply as inflation either increased or decreased. In 1974, when inflation was at double-digit levels, Burns, who had the responsibility for devising the central banking system's interest-rate policies, escalated the rates, a move that caused him to be blamed for helping plunge the U.S. into a recession that same year. In 1969 he was economic adviser to Pres. Richard M. Nixon and later served under Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. In 1980 he was founding chairman of the Committee to Fight Inflation, and from 1981 to 1985 he served as ambassador to West Germany.<P>

<B>Burns, Clarence H(enry),</B> byname Clarence Du Burns (b. Sept. 17, 1918, Baltimore, Md. - d. Jan. 12, 2003, Baltimore), mayor of Baltimore (1987). At 19 - though not of the then-legal voting age of 21 - he registered as a Democrat and became the first black member of the 7th Ward's powerful Bohemian Club. The young Burns began corralling votes for members while building his own political base. He was hired as a locker room attendant at Dunbar High School through City Hall connections, and with political acumen, charm, and personal warmth, ascended from that modest job to the city's highest office. He got the nickname "Du" in the 1940s when he was knee-deep in local politics - always doing things for people. Among his many deeds was delivering votes for Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., the task that helped him land the locker room job. He learned the ins and outs of politics through his own political club, which evolved into the Eastside Democratic Organization. From that platform, he launched his campaign for City Council from the 2nd District in 1971 - and won. For the next 17 years he worked at City Hall, making urban renewal the centrepiece of his efforts. By 1986, he had risen to council president, and he went on to become the city's first black mayor in January 1987, when William D. Schaefer left to become Maryland's governor. But he served as mayor for only 11 months - going down to defeat in the 1987 mayoral primary to state attorney Kurt L. Schmoke. Burns ran again in 1991, only to lose again to Schmoke. In his first eight months as mayor, Burns created the first city program to help the homeless, started several housing initiatives, found money to keep five imperiled library branches from closing, and increased school funding.<P>

<B>Burokevicius, Mykolas (Martinovich)</B> (b. Oct. 7, 1927, Alytus, Lithuania), first secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party (1990-91).

Burokevicius and his subordinate Juozas Jermalavicius were detained in Belarus in 1993 and taken to Lithuania. In August 1999, the Vilnius District Court sentenced Burokevicius to 12 years in prison for organizing murder and grievous bodily harm, establishing anti-state organizations, and committing other crimes. He had been awaiting his ruling in prison, so by the time the ruling was handed down, he had already served half of his sentence. He was released on Jan. 13, 2006.<P>

<B>Burr, Aaron</B> (b. Feb. 6, 1756, Newark, N.J. - d. Sept. 14, 1836, Port Richmond, N.Y., U.S.), U.S. vice president (1801-05). He served on Gen. George Washington's staff during the Revolutionary War (1775-83) but was transferred after antagonizing Washington. In 1784 and 1785 he was elected to the New York state assembly, and in 1789 he was appointed attorney general by Gov. George Clinton. By 1791 he had built a successful coalition against Gen. Philip Schuyler, father-in-law of Alexander Hamilton, and won election to the U.S. Senate, incurring the enmity of Hamilton. Burr failed to be reelected in 1797 and spent the next two years in state politics. In 1800 he won the Republican (Jeffersonian) vice presidential nomination. Under the procedures then prevailing, the electors cast their votes for both Thomas Jefferson and Burr without indicating who should be president and who vice president. Hamilton's determined opposition to Burr finally resulted in Jefferson's election. In February 1804 Burr's friends in the New York legislature nominated him for the governorship. Again Hamilton helped to bring about Burr's defeat, and shortly thereafter Clinton replaced him as the Republican vice presidential candidate. Once again he felt himself to be the victim of Hamilton's animosity, and they fought a duel (July 11, 1804) at Weehawken, N.J., in which Hamilton was killed. With warrants out for his arrest in two states, Burr fled to Philadelphia, where he contacted his friend Gen. James Wilkinson. They conspired to invade Mexico, but Wilkinson betrayed Burr to President Jefferson. Trying to escape to Spanish territory, Burr was arrested and returned for trial at Richmond, Va. (May 1807). He was tried for treason, and although he was acquitted, he remained under a cloud of suspicion.<P>

While he was in office, voters approved a constitutional amendment that allowed him to become the state's first governor to serve two consecutive four-year terms. He launched the state's first kindergarten program and steered Georgia through two recessions. Seeing the demise of agriculture and textiles as the state's leading industries, he worked to attract emerging high technology businesses that propelled Georgia's growth in the 1990s.<P>

<A NAME="busch"><B>Busch (Becerra), Germ�n</B> (b. March 23, 1903, San Javier, Santa Cruz province, Bolivia - d. Aug. 23, 1939, La Paz, Bolivia), president of Bolivia (1937-39). A hero of the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay, he afterwards served as commander of the cavalry brigade and as chief of the general staff. He played a prominent part in the 1936 coup which deposed Pres. Jos� Luis Tejada Sorzano and installed Col. Jos� David Toro as chairman of the Government Junta. In 1937 Toro resigned at the demand of a group of army officers and Socialist leaders and Colonel Busch took up his place. He restored the 1880 constitution which had been suspended by Toro. Inspired by Dionisio Foianini, he confiscated the $17,000,000 investment of the Standard Oil Company on March 15, 1937. Foianini became his minister of mines and petroleum in May 1938 after the Congress legalized the seizure. That month a constituent assembly elected Busch president. Busch and Foianini hoped to rebuild Bolivia's collapsed economic structure on the foundation of its oil wealth. Labour troubles and bitter political friction among rival factions, however, continued to harass the country. In April 1939, Busch, whose army included 5,000 German-trained soldiers, established a totalitarian state. He dissolved Congress and the courts, suspended the constitution, and established absolute control over financial and political activities. He was careful to explain that his regime was entirely Bolivian in character and was not allied to the totalitarian ideology of any European state. On Aug. 23, 1939, he died of a bullet wound. The official announcement said he shot himself at his own home during a birthday party for his brother-in-law and that he had been suffering from a severe depression.<P>

<B>Bush, George (Herbert Walker)</B> (b. June 12, 1924, Milton, Mass.), president of the United States (1989-93). He became active in the Republican Party in Houston in 1959, and, after losing a campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1964, he was elected (1966) to the House of Representatives from a safely Republican Texas district. He gave up the seat in 1970 to run again, unsuccessfully, for the Senate. Pres. Richard Nixon chose him to serve as UN ambassador (1971-73). He was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973-74. Pres. Gerald Ford appointed him chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing in 1974. He also served as CIA director (1976-77). In 1980 he mounted a campaign for the Republican presidential nomination but abandoned it in May to support Ronald Reagan, who chose Bush as his running mate. They won the 1980 election and were reelected in 1984 for a second term. Bush secured the 1988 presidential nomination and defeated the Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis. In December 1989 Bush ordered a brief military invasion of Panama, which toppled that country's leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega, who had been indicted in the U.S. on drug-trafficking charges. When Iraq occupied Kuwait in August 1990, Bush built up an international coalition against Iraq and, over the objections of those who favoured giving an embargo more time to work, increased the U.S. military presence in the region to about 500,000 troops within a few months. After Iraq failed to withdraw from Kuwait, Bush authorized a U.S.-led offensive that began on Jan. 16-17, 1991, which restored Kuwait to independence, at a cost of at least 100,000 Iraqi lives. Bush's popularity dissipated when an economic recession that began late in 1990 persisted into 1992. He lost his reelection bid in 1992 to Democrat Bill Clinton.<P>

<B>Bush, George W(alker)</B> (b. July 6, 1946, New Haven, Conn.), president of the United States (2001-09); son of George Bush. A Republican, he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1978. In 1995-2000 he was governor of Texas; he defeated incumbent Democrat Ann Richards by a greater than expected 53%-46% in 1994, and after being reelected in 1998, he was increasingly seen as the likely Republican presidential candidate in 2000. On June 12, 1999, he formally announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. He described himself as a "compassionate conservative." By March 7, 2000, so-called Super Tuesday, when Bush took 9 of 13 contests, it was clear that he would win the nomination. He took a strong lead in the opinion polls over Vice Pres. Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, but then the gap in the polls between Bush and Gore narrowed to the closest in any election in 40 years. Although Bush lost the nationwide popular vote by 500,000 votes out of 105 million cast on November 7, the presidency hinged on Florida's 25 electoral votes. The result in Florida was so close that for five weeks after election day, Florida and federal courts weighed the legal challenges until the U.S. Supreme Court effectively awarded the presidency to Bush. By winning Florida, Bush narrowly won the electoral vote over Gore by 271 to 266. With his inauguration, Bush became only the second son of a president to assume the nation's highest office; the other was John Quincy Adams (1825-29), the son of John Adams (1797-1801). After attacks by Islamic extremists on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Bush called for a global war on terrorism. The U.S. subsequently toppled the regimes of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). The latter campaign was widely opposed internationally even among allies like Germany and France. He was reelected in 2004, defeating Democrat John Kerry 51%-48%. After the poor handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the financial crisis of 2008, among other factors, he left office as one of the most unpopular presidents in history.<P>

<B>Bush, Jeb,</B> byname of John Ellis Bush (b. Feb. 11, 1953, Midland, Texas), governor of Florida (1999-2007); son of George Bush; brother of George W. Bush. After he lost the 1994 race for governor to the Democratic incumbent, Lawton Chiles, by barely 60,000 votes - the closest governor's race in Florida history - he almost immediately began to reshape his image. He polished some rough political edges and courted new constituencies: Jews, the elderly, and black leaders. While he changed some things, Bush retained his tough stands on crime and opposition to abortion except in instances of rape, incest, or where the mother's health is in danger. He won an easy victory in 1998, collecting 55% of the vote to 45% for Democratic Lt.Gov. Buddy MacKay. After the 2000 presidential election, Jeb Bush and Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris have been accused of helping to deliver the state to George W. Bush by disenfranchising thousands of mostly black voters, supposedly felons or ex-felons, but in fact including many non-felons whose name, gender, birth date, and race matched - or nearly matched - one of the tens of millions of ex-felons in the United States.<P>

He entered the Gold Coast legislature in 1951, led the opposition to Kwame Nkrumah in Ashanti, and in 1957 headed the National United Party opposition in Ghana's National Assembly before seeking voluntary exile in the Netherlands and Britain (1959-66). After Nkrumah's overthrow he returned to head the interim military government's advisory committees. Following elections, he became prime minister on Sept. 30, 1969, but his government's economic difficulties led to a military coup (Jan. 13, 1972) while he was visiting England that brought an end to democratic rule. Busia, informed of the coup, chose to remain in England.<P>

<A NAME="bussi"><B>Bussi, Antonio Domingo</B> (b. Jan. 17, 1926, Victoria, Entre R�os, Argentina), governor of Tucum�n (1995-99). He was one of the military's most hard-line leaders during the 1976-83 dictatorship. Human rights groups say Bussi was among officers who tortured and killed dissidents, and that at least 400 people vanished in Tucum�n alone while Bussi commanded forces there. Life after the dictatorship brought legal troubles for the junta leaders, but Bussi parlayed his military ties into years of political success. Disillusionment with a series of post-dictatorship leaders helped him win the governorship of Tucum�n, and in July 2003 he won the mayoral race in San Miguel de Tucum�n, the province's capital. The same month he was ordered held under house arrest as part of an extradition request by Spanish judge Baltasar Garz�n, but it was later dropped by Spain's government and Bussi was freed after 45 days of house arrest.<P>

<B>Bustamante, Sir (William) Alexander,</B> original name William Alexander Clarke (b. Feb. 24, 1884, Blenheim, Hanover parish, Jamaica - d. Aug. 6, 1977, Irish Town, Jamaica), chief minister (1953-55) and prime minister (1962-67) of Jamaica; cousin of Norman Manley. After traveling across Latin America and the Mediterranean, he returned to Jamaica in the early 1930s with the name Bustamante (he officially changed his name by deed poll in 1944). A labour organizer in the 1930s, he founded the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union, Jamaica's largest union. Subsequently he formed (1943) the moderate Jamaica Labour Party to counteract Manley's more radical People's National Party. His party won the 1944 elections, and he became minister of communications and unofficial head of government, until in 1953 he became chief minister and minister of local government. After his party's defeat in 1955, he led the opposition. He was president of the West Indies Democratic Labour Party from 1958 to 1960, but resigned to campaign for Jamaica's withdrawal from the federation. Becoming prime minister in April 1962, he presided over Jamaica's acquisition of independence (August 1962) and then also took over the ministries of external affairs and defense. He initiated extensive public works programs and land reform. He was knighted in June 1955.<P>

<B>Buthelezi, (Ashpenaz Nathan) Mangosuthu (Gatsha)</B> (b. Aug. 27, 1928, Mahlabatini, Natal [now in KwaZulu-Natal], South Africa), South African politician; grandson of Dinuzulu and great-grandson of Cetshwayo (kings of kwaZulu). He was a member of the Youth League of the African National Congress (ANC). He assumed his role as the hereditary chief of the Buthelezi clan of Zulus in 1953 and was accepted in that role by white authorities about four years later. Though he initially opposed the creation of black homelands (then called Bantustans), Buthelezi won election as chief minister of the nonindependent black state of KwaZulu in 1972. In 1974, having broken with the ANC, Buthelezi revived Inkatha yeNkululeko yeSizwe, a movement founded in 1924 by his grandfather, King Dinizulu, as a Zulu cultural movement. Buthelezi rejected full independence for KwaZulu and continued to work within the white establishment to end apartheid. After the South African government lifted its ban on the ANC in 1990 and began signaling its willingness to disband the apartheid system, Buthelezi became engaged in a fierce struggle for political leadership with the ANC and its allies for the allegiance of black South Africans. As a result, thousands were killed in clashes between Inkatha and ANC supporters in Natal in the years 1990-94. Meanwhile, Buthelezi converted his cultural movement into a political party, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), in order to compete in South Africa's first all-race parliamentary elections in 1994. His party received 10.5% of the total vote, and Buthelezi was appointed minister of home affairs in a coalition government formed by ANC leader Nelson Mandela. In June 1999 he was offered the post of deputy president by the new president Thabo Mbeki, but Buthelezi refused. He remained home affairs minister until 2004.<P>

In 1853 he was elected by the Democrats to the Massachusetts legislature, and remained a member of that body until 1860, distinguishing himself by vigorously supporting the cause of labour and of naturalized citizens. Though he was affiliated with the Southern wing of the Democratic Party in the 1860 elections, he strongly supported the Union after the Civil War broke out. He was appointed a Union officer for political reasons, and his military career was mercurial and often controversial. He became a strong opponent of slavery and refused to return fugitive slaves. He was also one of the few military commanders who favoured the recruitment of black regiments. After the war, he became a Radical Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives (1867-75, 1877-79), supporting firm Reconstruction measures toward the South and playing a leading role in the impeachment trial of Pres. Andrew Johnson. Although a staunch supporter of Pres. Ulysses S. Grant after 1868, he broke with the party in 1878 because of his sympathy with the inflationary Greenback Movement. After two unsuccessful tries, he was elected Democratic governor of Massachusetts in 1882 and two years later became the presidential candidate of the Greenback Labor Party and the Anti-Monopoly Party. He advocated the eight-hour day and national control of interstate commerce but failed to win a single electoral vote. At various times in his career Butler was accused of corruption, but no charges against him were ever proved.<P>

He was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in 1929 and represented Saffron Walden throughout his parliamentary career. He served as private secretary to Sir Samuel Hoare and helped draw up the Government of India Act, 1935. In 1938, as undersecretary of state at the Foreign Office, he became one of the main defenders in the House of Commons of the policy of appeasement, and this had an adverse effect later on in his career. He was moved to the Board of Education (1941-45) and reorganized the educational system. In 1951-55 he was chancellor of the exchequer and presided over a period of economic expansion that allowed him to make considerable tax concessions in his last budget. These proved, however, to have been overoptimistic. In 1955-59 he was lord privy seal. He suffered a further setback in 1956 because of his outspoken and inflexible line during the Suez crisis. This probably explained his failure to be chosen as successor to the prime ministership when Anthony Eden resigned. He served as home secretary (1957-62) and deputy prime minister (1962-63) under Harold Macmillan. As head of the Central African Office, he played a major role in the 1963 conference that ultimately led to the independence of Zambia and Malawi. In October 1963 Macmillan resigned, but once more, Butler failed in his bid for the party leadership. He served as foreign secretary under Sir Alec Douglas-Home until the Conservative defeat in 1964, was appointed in 1965 as a life peer, and remained an active member of the House of Lords until a few years before his death.<P>

He belonged to the same Tutsi group as both his predecessors, Michel Micombero and Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. The Tutsi, who made up some 15% of the population, dominated the majority Hutu people since independence. On Sept. 3, 1987, the unknown army officer seized power in a bloodless coup when Bagaza was attending a conference of heads of state of French-speaking nations in Quebec. The reasons Buyoya advanced for the coup were almost identical to those that had been advanced by Bagaza when he overthrew Micombero in 1976. Buyoya denounced the speculation, corruption, and fraud of the Bagaza regime and promised to respect human rights, religious freedom, and constitutional government. His immediate aim was to bring to an end the struggle that had been taking place for some time between the state and the Roman Catholic Church. He promised that his regime would be more liberal than that of his predecessor and that it would be relaxed in its approach to tribal, religious, and political policies. In his takeover speech immediately after the coup, he said that those who had plotted the coup - which appeared to have been instigated solely by the military - had objected to the acquisition of too much power by one person (Bagaza had been head of state, chief of the armed forces, and leader of the ruling party, UPRONA). Buyoya also condemned the institutional inertia, the "constant violation of the constitution," and the "incoherent" economic policy of his predecessor's regime. He promised religious freedom for all and immediately reopened Roman Catholic places of worship that had been closed down during the church-state row of the preceding year.<P>

He oversaw the drafting of the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) programme but was little-known until 1997. In that year the AWS won elections and the tall, greying Buzek was selected as prime minister owing to his ties with AWS leader Marian Krzaklewski, who did not want to be prime minister but planned to steer policy as head of the AWS caucus.

<A NAME="byrne"><TABLE ALIGN="Left"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="byrne.jpg" HEIGHT="100"><BR>Byrne</TR></TABLE>
<B>Byrne, Jane M(argaret),</B> <I>n�e</I> Burke (b. May 24, 1934, Chicago, Ill.), mayor of Chicago (1979-83). Democrat Byrne entered politics as a Chicago volunteer in John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, another Kennedy supporter, was impressed with her firm, no-nonsense style. Beginning in 1964 he appointed her to several relatively minor city hall jobs. In 1974 Daley named her co-chairman of the Cook County, Ill., Democratic Party. Since Byrne's position in the party hierarchy depended almost entirely on Daley's sponsorship, Daley's death in 1976 seemed a serious blow to her career. The Daley machine's handpicked new mayor, Michael Bilandic, stripped her of her position in the party, although she kept her job as Chicago's commissioner of consumer sales, weights and measures. Then Byrne, in a remarkable reversal, turned against the machine her mentor had created. In 1977, using her consumer job as a platform, she accused Bilandic and others of attempting to "grease" the way for a taxi-fare increase. Bilandic promptly fired her. Suddenly, Byrne had become a symbol of reform in Chicago and, ultimately, a candidate for mayor. Aided by a massive snowstorm that Chicagoans believed was dealt with poorly by the Bilandic administration, Byrne narrowly defeated Bilandic in the February 1979 Democratic mayoral primary and went on to a landslide victory in the April 3 general election. Whereas Daley was known by a single nickname - "Hizzoner" - Byrne had a number of nicknames. To some she was "Ayatollah Jane" or "Calamity Jane"; to others, she was "Miss Bossy" or "Mommy Mayor."<P>
