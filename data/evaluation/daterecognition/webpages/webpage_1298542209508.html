The evaluation of the social impact was done through (a) repeated social surveys on the population of 14 mining areas in Romania; and (b) in-depth interviews with individuals (miners and their families) directly affected by the economic restructuring, local businesspersons who might provide employment opportunities to laid-off workers, and local authorities. We also conducted training activities for the personnel of the National Agency for Development and Implementation Reconstruction Programs for the Mining Regions. The goal of our training activities in the fields of economics and social research methodology was to teach the employees of this state agency how to measure, monitor, and evaluate the social and economic consequences of the mining sector&rsquo;s restructuring.</span></p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: 8.5pt">&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span></em> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 8.5pt">&ldquo;The Rural Development Program&rsquo;s Evaluation Study&rdquo; </span></em><span style="font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 8.5pt">for the World Bank-financed Rural Development Program, the Ministry of Interior and Administration 2001-2006<em>. </em>This study had the following components:</span></p><span style="font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; letter-spacing: -0.1pt; font-size: 8.5pt">1) <em>Baseline Survey (2001)</em>. The Baseline survey was designed to asses the initial situation of the communes and villages where the World Bank&rsquo;s Rural Development Project (RDP) was supposed to be implemented. These communes were located in the following 5 Romanian counties: SÄƒlaj, BotoÅŸani, Tulcea, CÄƒlÄƒraÅŸi, and Dolj.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8.5pt">The purpose of the RDP was to strengthen local governance by improving the capacity of local administration to undertake socially, economically and technically viable investments, and to increase the availability of infrastructure and other public/community goods to rural inhabitants in programme areas</span><strong><span style="color: #424242"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">.&nbsp; </font></span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8.5pt">The 2001 Baseline Survey was carried out by employing a quasi-experimental method. Specifically, the survey was conducted on two samples as follows: 1) the treatment sample &ndash; this sample included communes from the programme areas, which were supposed to receive financial support for infrastructure works (water supply and roads); 2) the control sample, which consisted of communes in the neighboring counties that were not included in the RDP. In each of the communes included in the two samples we conducted household-level interviews, interviews with public officials at the commune level, and interviews with informal leaders at the village level. The households included in the Baseline Survey formed the panel sample on which two sub-sequent studies were conducted (see below). In addition to carrying out surveys in the two groups of communes, CURS conducted focus-groups with citizens of target (or RDP) communes.</span></p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8.5pt">&nbsp;</span> <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8.5pt">2) <em>Mid-term Evaluation Study (2004-2005) </em>was conducted by surveys in the treatment and control groups (RDP and non-RDP communes), using a panel sample.

CURS evaluated the program for the period 1998-2002 by combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Our evaluation focused on 1) the social impact of programs for the deinstitutionalization of children and&nbsp;2) the economic efficiency of these programs. Specifically, we performed financial analyses of the program, and conducted individual and focus-group interviews with people involved in this program (e.g., representatives of the above mentioned NGOs and their partners, local authorities, families, media representatives etc.). </span>			</td>
