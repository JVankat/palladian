      <p>As reported 
  in the February Email Bulletin, due to staff and priority changes at 
  the New York Times (NYT), it is no longer able to lead the publisher 
  recruiting effort described in <a href="northeast_newspaper_recycling_taskforce_final_report_1999.pdf" target="_blank">Final 
    Report of the Northeast Newspaper Recycling Task Force</a>. Fortunately, 
  the <a href="http://www.naa.org" target="_blank">Newspaper Association of America (NAA)</a> is picking up where the NYT left off. Since NAA has taken the leadership 
  role in ensuring that the goal of having publishers representing 80% 
  of newspaper used annually in the region commit to the task force's 
  recommendations is reached, several publishing companies have added 
  their support to the regional approach. These companies include The 
  Star Ledger (Newark), Macromedia, EW Scripps, and the MediaNews Group. 
  With these additional commitments, NERC now has publishers accounting 
  for over 1.2 million tons of annual newspaper use formally committed 
  to the regional approach. This represents 63% of newspaper use region 
  wide. In order to reach the 80% goal, we will need a newspaper accounting 
  for an additional 340,000 to support the regional approach. NERC will 
  continue to work with NAA to ensure that is goal is attained. For further 
  information contact <a href="mailto:lynn@nerc.org">Lynn Rubinstein</a> at NERC.</p>

  publishers to support the recommendations of the <a href="northeast_newspaper_recycling_taskforce_final_report_1999.pdf" target="_blank">Northeast 
    Newspaper Recycling Task Force</a>. NAA, in cooperation with NERC, is 
  striving to have publishers representing 80% of newspaper used annually

<h2><a name="september2001" id="september2001">September 2001</a></h2>
<h4><b><i>Northeast 
  Newspaper Publishers Agreement Achieves Goal of 80% Commitment</i></b></h4>
<p>It's happened - NERC has received commitments from newspaper publishers in the Northeast 
  that will ensure that 86% of the newsprint used in the Northeast will 
  have an average recycled content rate of 27%. </p>
<p>Beginning 
  in1997 NERC spearheaded a ten state collaborative effort to expand the 
  use of recycled content newsprint region. Concern about meeting state-established 
  recycled content goals of at least 40% by the year 2000 prompted publishers 
  in several Northeast states to urge a reassessment of the goals. The 
  lack of new investments in recycling capacity by manufacturers supplying 
  finished newsprint to the region since 1995 was at the root of their 
  concern. In recognition of this fact, state-recycling officials and 
  publishers in the Northeast agreed to establish the Northeast Newspaper 
  Recycling Task Force to determine whether out-year goals were attainable.</p>
<p>NERC, 
  with its long history of monitoring the availability of recycled newsprint 
  in the region and of maintaining a dialogue between publishers and states, 
  was chosen to organize and lead this effort. </p>
<p>The 
  Task Force worked throughout 1998 to develop a new regional policy affecting 
  Northeast publishers' purchases of recycled-content newsprint. The objective 
  of this new approach was to drive additional investments in, and maximum 
  utilization of, recycled-fiber based manufacturing capacity by the North 
  American newsprint industry, thereby sustaining the economics of old 
  newspaper recycling in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Under 
  this new approach, large newspapers and newspaper groups selling into 
  the region were asked to endorse a resolution committing them to purchase 
  newsprint containing a minimum level of recycled fiber content newsprint 
  annually. This minimum level, or floor, would be based on the purchase 
  of recycled fibers and would have to average at least 27 percent of 
  total fiber purchases each year. Once endorsements were received committing 
  80% of the regional annual tonnage of newsprint to the goal of achieving 
  an average 27% recycled content rate, the full implementation period 
  would begin. At that time NERC staff would be responsible for tracking 
  publishers' annual recycled-content purchases, including administering 
  surveys, and compiling and reporting results. State publisher associations 
  and the Newspaper Association of America would assist NERC in coordinating 
  this effort. The full <a href="northeast_newspaper_recycling_taskforce_final_report_1999.pdf" target="_blank">Task Force report</a> and <a href="onp_resolution.html" target="_blank">resolution</a> can be viewed on 
  the NERC web site. </p>
<p>Thanks 
  to the efforts of the <a href="http://www.naa.org" target="_blank">Newspaper Association 
    of America</a>, As of July 27, 2001 this long desired goal has been 
  achieved. As of that date 86% of the annual newsprint consumption in 
  the region has endorsed the agreement. Thus, the monitoring and evaluation 
  period now begins. Letters have been sent to each of the signatory publishers 
  asking for baseline data for average recycled content in calendar year 
  2000.</p>

          </font> As 
  was reported in the October 2001 Email Bulletin, publishers representing 
  more than 80% of the total newsprint consumption in the Northeast have 
  now endorsed and signed-on to the Northeast Newspaper Publishers Agreement. 
  For the past two months we have been collecting baseline data in order 
  to track the success of this effort over the next three years. We requested 
  the following information from each of the 12 signatory publishers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Total metric 
    tons of newsprint purchased in calendar 2000.</li>
  <li>Total metric 
    tons of newsprint purchased in calendar 2000 with recycled content.</li>
  <li>Average

<p>The results 
  are quite impressive.</p>

<p><b>Northeast 
  Newspaper Publishers' Agreement - Progress Report</b><font color="#003366"><b><font color="#008080"><br />
    </font> </b></font>The 
  first full year of monitoring for the Northeast Newspaper Publishers' 
  Agreement has just been completed. Publishers reported on the total 
  amount of newsprint paper consumed and the total amount of recycled 
  newsprint fiber contained in that newsprint paper for calendar 2001. 
  The question we asked the publishers about newsprint recycled content 
  was reframed this year (as compared to the questions asked in 2000) 
  to more specifically address percentage of recycled newsprint fiber 
  used rather than the average % of recycled content newsprint used (un-weighted). 
  As a result, we cannot compare the figures obtained last year with this 
  year. However the 2001 figures can be compared to those in the benchmark 
  year, 1997 (as described in the Newspaper 
    Publishers Agreement Task Force Report). At that time newspaper 
  publishers in the region were using newsprint containing an average 
  of 27% recycled newsprint fiber content. In 2001, they were using newsprint 
  containing an average of 28.8% recycled newsprint fiber. Therefore we 
  are pleased to report that the northeast newspaper publishers not only 
  met their commitment of 27% recycled newsprint fiber usage, they actually 
  slightly exceeded it. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several changes 
  occurred in the newspaper industry over the past year, and these changes 
  are reflected in the figures; most notably, a 39% decrease in metric 
  tons of newsprint purchased. It dropped from 2,520,967 tons in 2000 
  to 1,529,783 tons in 2001. To put this into historical perspective in 
  1996 - according to the Newspaper Association of America, consumption 
  of newsprint by daily newspaper publishers in the Northeast totaled 
  2 million tons. Overall, we 
  found that the publishers remain firmly committed to the intention of 
  the Newspaper Publishers' Agreement, and to the use of recycled content 
  in newsprint. The <a href="onp_resolution.html" target="_blank">Northeast 
    Newspaper Publishers' Agreement</a> has been signed by publishers representing 
  more than 80% of the total newsprint consumption in the Northeast. It 
  is a commitment to achieving an average recycled content rate of 27%.

    <p>Many changes have occurred             in the newspaper industry over the past several years, and these changes             are reflected in the figures; most notably, a significant decrease in             the metric tons of newsprint purchased. (There was a decrease in tons             of newsprint used of 46% between 2000 and 2002, and a 10% decrease 2001             - 2002.) This can be attributable to a several factors including the             economy, decreased advertising, and the light-weighting of newsprint             (smaller pages, smaller print, smaller margins, lighter weight paper,             etc.) </p>
    <p>According to the terms of             the Agreement, NERC will collect data for one more year (calendar 2003)             and then the Agreement will be re-evaluated by the signatories to determine             if it has been successful in achieving its goals, and if not, how it             should be adjusted. </p>

          <p><strong>Northeast Newspaper Publishers Update - 2003 Data &amp; Final Year             of Current Agreement<br />
          </strong>In 1998 the Northeast newspaper publishers and NERC adopted a landmark             resolution and commitment to buy recycled content newsprint and to annually             report on that usage. The agreement that embodies that resolution includes             the following language:</p>
          <table align="center" border="0" width="80%">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><p>The Northeast Recycling Council hereby resolves that it is in                   the public interest to support the recommendations of the Northeast                   Newspaper Recycling Task Force. NERC's support is contingent upon                   a buy recycled newsprint resolution consistent with that contained                   in the <a href="http://www.nerc.org/documents/northeast_newspaper_recycling_taskforce_final_report_1999.pdf" target="_blank">Task Force's 1998 report</a> being endorsed by a significant number of newspaper publishers.                   For purposes of this NERC resolution, a significant number shall                   mean publishers who represent at least eighty percent of the newsprint                   consumption by daily newspapers in the region. 1</p>
                    <p>NERC further resolves to work in cooperation with those newspaper                   publishers to evaluate the effectiveness of, and <em>if deemed                   necessary amend, the buy recycled newsprint resolution after three                   years</em> to determine the impacts of the resolution on the investment                   decisions of newsprint manufacturers, and on the economic sustainability                   of old newspaper recycling in the Northeast.

          <p>With the reporting of the calendar year 2003 data (see below) that             three-year mark has been met and technically the agreement has sunsetted.             The NERC Board has been working with the <a href="http://www.naa.org" target="_blank">Newspaper             Association of America</a> (NAA), our major partner in this venture,             to negotiate a continuation of the Agreement. The NAA has proposed that             the Agreement be renewed in perpetuity with a change relative to data             collection. The NERC Board discussed the NAA proposal at its <a href="http://www.nerc.org/documents/meetings/0410Minutes.html" target="_blank">Board             Meeting in October</a>. The Board <a href="http://www.nerc.org/documents/naa_nerc_board_response_2004.pdf" target="_blank">has             responded to the NAA</a> and there will be a joint conference call of             the NERC Board and NAA leadership on December 1st             to discuss the matter in more detail. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:lynn@nerc.org">Lynn Rubinstein</a>.</p>
          <p>Thus, depending on the outcome of the discussions with the NAA and             newspaper publishers of the region, the Calendar 2003 data may be the             last data collected and reported on the total tons of newsprint purchased             in the region, the tons of recycled newsprint fiber and the percent             of recycled fiber content. The 2003 data showed a disappointing decline             in the average recycled content while seeing a significant increase             in the overall tonnage of newsprint. </p>
          <p> 1 That threshold was reached in             the fall of 2001.</p>

        <h2><a name="march2005" id="march2005">March 2005</a></h2>
          <p><strong>Northeast Newspaper Publishers Agreement - <em>Alive &amp; Growing!</em><br />
          </strong>In the fall of 2004 the Northeast Newspaper Publisher's Agreement             (Agreement) reached a watershed moment: three complete years of data             on the use of recycled newsprint by the newspaper publishers of the             region had been collected and analyzed. The Agreement - a voluntary             partnership between NERC, the Newspaper Association of America (NAA),             and 15 newspaper publishers representing more than 86% of the newsprint             usage in the Northeast - called for an evaluation of the effectiveness             of the Agreement after three years.</p>
          <p>In late fall 2004 the NERC Board, NAA management and member newspapers             in the Northeast considered the question of the Agreement, whether it             had been effective, and how best to move forward. All parties strongly             felt that the Agreement had been a noteworthy achievement and a true             success. This multi-stakeholder voluntary collaboration addressing recycling             market development sets an example and demonstrates industry-wide leadership             even in the face of challenging and changing market conditions.</p>
          <p>Over the course of the past three years, NERC has been responsible             for collecting the data from the publishers and reporting on the results.             The success of this process has motivated NAA not only to assume this             annual data collection component of the Agreement, but to make its scope             national. </p>
          <p>Beginning in 2005, the NAA will collect and report on regional and             national recycled content usage statistics to NERC. This will be accomplished             through a modification of its annual industry survey which went out             to newspapers in February 05. As such, the NAA expects to be able to             report the 2004 usage figures in early summer 2005. This will result             in an expanded and timelier reporting of data than the data collection             process originally implemented. </p>
          <p>The newspapers that are signatories to the Agreement are: </p>

        <p><strong>Northeast Newspaper Publishers' Agreement - Progress Report Calendar             2004 - Recycled Content Up<br />
      </strong>Another year of monitoring for the <a href="northeast_newspaper_recycling_taskforce_final_report_1999.pdf" target="_blank">Northeast             Newspaper Publishers' Agreement</a> has been completed. This year, the             data collection was handled by the <a href="http://www.naa.org" target="_blank">Newspaper             Association of America</a> (NAA) and not by NERC. </p>
      <p>The Fall of 2004 marked the third year anniversary of the Northeast             Newspaper Publishers' Agreement. At that time, the Agreement and its             impacts were reviewed. It was agreed by all parties that it had been             a success; achieving its goals of a commitment to increase usage of             recycled content newsprint in the region and achieving a minimum recycled             content of 27%. The newspaper publishers expressed their ongoing commitment             to the Agreement and its goals. At that time, the NAA stepped forward             with the offer to leverage its existing industry data collection efforts             to collect the information necessary for monitoring the progress of             the Northeast Newspaper Publishers' Agreement. </p>
      <p>NAA's approach to data collection was to include recycling questions             with its annual newsprint consumption survey. The survey process closely             followed NERC's previous efforts. The newsprint consumption survey was             distributed to over 200 newspapers with various sizes of circulation.             The top circulation newspapers were included, which meant that NAA received             the results from over 70% of the population and then extrapolated the             balance based on regional and circulation figures. In its survey, NAA             asked for the total metric tons of newsprint used; the metric tons of             recycled newsprint fiber used; and the percentage of recycled fiber             in the newsprint. After collecting the data, the statistics were compiled             by NAA's Business Analysis Department and were reviewed internally as             well as externally.</p>

        <dt>Several reasons may contribute to the difference between the 24.53%               amount of recycled fiber in newsprint in 2003 from the NERC survey               and the 29.4% for 2004 in the Northeast region:
          <ul type="disc">
              <li> Reduced virgin newsprint capacity at mills in Canada;</li>
            <li>Newspapers reducing the size of the newsprint web width to 48                   inches; and </li>
            <li>Unlike the NERC survey which included only large newspapers                   in its survey, NAA's survey was distributed to newspapers with                   11 different circulation sizes, ranging from greater than 500,000                   to less than 5,000. NAA believes that many small market newspapers                   turn to brokers to purchase newsprint. These brokers may be getting                   newsprint from other parts of the country. </li>
          </ul>
        </dt>
      </dl>
      <p>Going forward, NAA plans to refine its survey process, perhaps making             it an electronic survey, and hopes to begin collecting 2005 data in             the spring of 2006.</p>

    <p>The Northeast Newspaper Publishers' Agreement, which has been in place since the fall of 2001, establishes a goal increasing usage of recycled content newsprint in the region and achieving a minimum recycled content of 27%. </p>
    <p>To collect the data, NAA asked its approximately 900 newspapers with various sizes of circulation, including those who provide data on a regular basis for the newsprint consumption survey, to provide information for the survey. Nationally, NAA received 122 responses; a quarter of those responses (31) from the Northeast. &nbsp;&nbsp;This represents a 24% increase in the number of responses received as compared to last year.&nbsp; There are 12 newspaper publishers that are signatories to the Newspaper Publishers&rsquo; Agreement, and one statewide newspaper publishers association. </p>
    <p>In its survey, NAA asked for the total metric tons of newsprint used; the metric tons of recycled newsprint fiber used; and the percentage of recycled fiber in the newsprint. &nbsp;After collecting the data, the statistics were compiled by NAA's Business Analysis Department and were reviewed internally as well as externally. </p>

    <p><strong>Northeast Newspaper Publishers' Agreement - Progress Report Calendar 2008</strong></p>
    
    <p>Another year  of monitoring for the <a href="northeast_newspaper_recycling_taskforce_final_report_1999.pdf" target="_blank">Northeast Newspaper  Publishers' Agreement</a> has been completed. &nbsp;Data collection and analysis took a different  route this time.&nbsp; As in 2005&mdash;the last  full year of data collection&mdash;the <a href="http://www.naa.org/" target="_blank">Newspaper  Association of America (NAA)</a> sent out a survey and asked  approximately 900 newspapers with various sizes of circulation, including those  who provide data on a regular basis, for newsprint consumption data.&nbsp; In the survey, NAA asked for the total metric  tons of newsprint used, the metric tons of recycled newsprint fiber used, and  the percentage of recycled fiber in the newsprint.&nbsp; After an initial request in August 2008 and  numerous follow-ups, NAA was unable to obtain sufficient data to calculate the  aggregate recycled content of newsprint for 2007.&nbsp; While NAA received some  information in response to the request, it did not have enough data to  calculate a statistically reliable percentage.&nbsp; Given the economic  downturn, there have been changes in operations at many newspapers which made  it difficult to find the appropriate person collecting the data.&nbsp; As a result, NERC and NAA sought alternative  ways to assess the status of the use of recycled content by the newspaper  publishers in the region.&nbsp; Two sources of  information proved to be of great value.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.pppc.org/" target="_blank">Pulp and  Paper Products Council (PPPC)</a> of Canada and the Connecticut Department  of Environmental Protection generously provided data for calendar 2008.&nbsp; The PPPC provided cumulative data for all  mills shipping newsprint to the 10 Northeast states (Connecticut,  Delaware, Maine,  Massachusetts, New   Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont).&nbsp; As such, the information that it provided  exceeds the universe of data that was reported in 2005.&nbsp; At the time of signing the agreement in 2001,  the signatory publishers represented 86% of the newsprint tonnage in the region.&nbsp; The PPPC noted that mills have told it that when  a customer has a specific recycled content requirement for its newsprint, the  mill will adjust the amount of recycled pulp for a specific production run to  meet this requirement and all shipments sent to this customer will have that  exact recycled content.&nbsp; The PPPC data  reflects the average recycled content of newsprint sold into the region at  29.5%.</p>
    <p>The state of  Connecticut  is the only state in the Northeast region to have legislation related to  minimum recycled content and it requires annual reporting to the state  Department of Environmental Protection on the same three data points as above &ndash;  total metric tons purchased, tons recycled newsprint fiber, and the percent  recycled fiber.&nbsp; Data from 2008 reported  to Connecticut  indicates an average recycled content of 32.5%.&nbsp;  The higher average rate may be a result of the comment above that mills  will adjust recycled content to meet the needs of customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The  Northeast Newspaper Publishers' Agreement, which has been in place since the  fall of 2001, establishes a goal increasing usage of recycled content newsprint  in the region and achieving a minimum recycled content of 27%.&nbsp; There are 12 newspaper publishers that are  signatories to the Newspaper Publishers&rsquo; Agreement and one statewide newspaper  publishers association. </p>
