<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">For conspiracy theorists in particular<span lang="en-us"> 
(and also for those who like to see doggies and horsies in puffy cloud 
formations)</span>, it's a wonderful symbol on which to
fixate: the Great Seal of the United States being part of some huge secret
'sign' that Freemasonry rules everything - and <i><b>proven</b></i> by the<span lang="en-us"> 
seal being on the 
United States'</span> one
dollar bill.<span lang="en-us"> (Wouldn't you think they would have made a THREE 
dollar bill and put it on there? After all, ONE isn't one of those magical, 
mystical Masonic numbers you read about, is it?)</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Curiously, <span lang="en-us">this</span> theory is sometimes reinforced by naive Masons
repeating an oft-heard (but totally erroneous) claim that Masons did, in fact,
design the seal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The designing of a seal of the U.S. was first commissioned by the Continental Congress immediately after the signing of the
Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. A committee consisting of Benjamin
Franklin (a Mason), John Adams (not a Mason), and Thomas Jefferson (not a Mason
although sometimes erroneously identified as one) submitted a design that was deemed
unacceptable, <b><i> as were designs submitted by two succeeding committees</i></b>. In
1782 (nearly six years later!) these designs were submitted to Charles Thomson,
Secretary to the Continental Congress, (and <b> NOT a Mason</b>) who prepared a design which, with some
alterations, was adopted by the <span lang="en-us">Congress </span>on June 20, 1782.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b><i>Here's some additional, detailed information about the Seal, all of
which is thanks to the research of Texas Mason Bill Maddox to whom this site's
author is grateful for <span lang="en-us">his resourcefullness</span></i></b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">In a book titled <u>THE EAGLE AND THE SHIELD - A History of the Great Seal of the
United States (1976)</u>, on Page 529: &quot;Did Freemasonry Influence the Great
Seal Design?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because membership records for the Revolutionary period are scattered and imperfect, it is not possible to ascertain with certainty which
persons among the 14 who participated in the designing of the Great Seal were Masons and which were not.  Conrad Hahn, Executive Secretary of the
Masonic Service Association of the US has furnished the following:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>1. Definitely a Mason:</b> Bro. Ben Franklin.<br>
<b>
2. Definitely not:</b> John Adams and Charles Thomson.<br>
<b>
3. No firm evidence of a Masonic connection, although allegations of
such a connection have been noted:</b> Jefferson, Lovell, Hopkinson,
Middleton, Rutledge. <i> <font color="#FF0000"><b>(Masonicinfo note: Based on more
current research, it is now accepted that Jefferson was not a Mason!)</b></font></i><br>
<b>
4. No record at all, so presumably not Masons:</b> Du Simitiere, Scott,<span lang="en-us">
</span>Houston, Lee, Boudinot, and William Barton (although <span lang="en-us">
he </span>has at times been confused with another William Barton who was a Mason).</font></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Although </font>
</span><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Washington was a Mason, he played no role in designing the Great Seal.  And although
Benjamin Franklin, a Mason and Past Grand Master of Pennsylvania, was a member of the first
seal committee, his proposal (P14) had no influence on the final designs, and he was in France when those designs were drawn up.  The
only individual listed who has been said to be a Mason (<i><b>with no firm
evidence</b></i>) is
Hopkinson, whose pyramid design for the Continental<span lang="en-us"> </span>currency's $50 bill clearly influenced the final reverse of the Great
Seal.<br>
<br>
The pyramid, the eye, and the radiant triangle have often been considered to be of Masonic origin.  Writers who are Masons have
also seen Masonic symbolism in the eagle, in the number of feathers on the eagle's wings, etc. It should perhaps be noted that some of the details
studied and interpreted by these writers are those of comparatively recent realizations of the Great Seal, details which are not stated in
the blazon itself and are not to be found in the Great Seal die of 1782.<br>
<br>
Without questioning the fact that element of the Great Seal design are also to be found as Masonic symbols, one may question whether the
designers of the seal intended it to be given a specifically Masonic interpretation.  Since there is no evidence that either Thomson or
Barton was a Mason, and as they were the two individuals responsible for the final design, the presumption would be that they did not intend
their work to be given a Masonic interpretation.<br>
<br>
Were there sources other than Freemasonry from which symbols such as the all-seeing eye and the unfinished pyramid could have been taken?  The
answer is yes.  Use of the eye in art forms, including medallic art, as a symbol for an omniscient and ubiquitous Deity was a well established
artistic convention quite apart from Masonic symbolism, and DuSimitiere, an artist, would have been aware of this.  As to the Pyramid,
there was widespread interest in Egypt in the 18th century.  There was a detailed work entitled
<u> Pyramidographia</u> which would have been available to both Hopkinson and Barton.  This work included a drawing of the
&quot;First Pyramid&quot;, which was stepped, did not come to a complete point, and had an entrance in the center on the ground level-a detail also in
Hopkinson's design.<br>
<br>
<b>While these points are not conclusive, it seems likely that the designers of the Great Seal and the Masons took their symbols from<span lang="en-us">
</span>parallel sources, and unlikely that the seal designers consciously<span lang="en-us">
</span>copied Masonic symbols with the intention of incorporating Masonic<span lang="en-us">
</span>Symbolism into the national Coat of Arms.</b>&quot;<span lang="en-us">

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Use of the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; - P518<br>
<br>
From the House Committee on the Judiciary (3/28/1956)<br>
<br>
This joint resolution establishes &quot;In God We Trust&quot; as the national<span lang="en-us">
</span>motto of the U.S.  At present the U.S. has no national motto.  It is<span lang="en-us">
</span>most appropriate that &quot;In God We Trust&quot; be so designated....  Further<span lang="en-us">
</span>recognition of this motto was given by the adoption of the Star-Spangled Banner as our national anthem.  One stanza ... is as follows:
&quot;And this be our motto -- 'In God is our trust.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">On page 75 are Charles Thomson's notes on his design - A pyramid unfinished - In the Zenith an Eye in a triangle ...
Over the Eye these words Annuit coeptis ... and underneath [the pyramid] these words Novus Ordo seclorum.&quot;  The pyramid was taken
from an earlier design of William Barton (shown on page 67) that had a different motto
DEO FAVENTE (God favoring) PERENNIS (through the years).  This, in&nbsp; turn, was similar to the design of a Fifty
Dollar bill designed by Francis Hopkinson.  Thomson wrote the following: &quot;The pyramid signifies Strength
and Duration: The Eye over it &amp; Motto allude to the many signal interpositions of
providence in favour of the American cause.  The date underneath is that of the Declaration of
Independce and the words under it signify the beginnings of the New American Era, which commences from
that date.&quot; P85.<br>
<br>
P89. &quot;The two mottoes which Thomson suggested, and Congress adapted, for the reverse ... can be traced more definitely to the poetry of Virgil.
Gaillard Hunt, in the Department of States first publisher on the seal in 1892, took official notice .... Annuit Coeptis, was described by Hunt
as an allusion to line 625 of book IX of the Aeneid JUPPITER OMNIPOTES, AUDACIBUS ANNUE COEPTIS (All-powerful Jupiter favor [my] daring
undertakings).  The last three words appear also in Virgil's GEORGICS, book I, line 40: DA FACILEM CURSUM, ATQUE AUDACIBUS ANNUE COEPTIS (Give
[me] an easy course, and favor [my] daring undertakings). Thompson changed the imperative ANNUE to ANNUIT, the third person
singular form of the same verb in either the present tense of the perfect tense.  The the motto ANNUIT COEPTIS the subject of the verb
must be supplied, and the translator must also choose the tense.  In his 1892 brochure, Hunt suggested that the missing subject was in effect the
eye at the apex of the pyramid ... and he<span lang="en-us"> </span>translated the motto-in the present tense-as &quot;it (the Eye of Providence) is favorable to our
undertakings.&quot;  In later publication the missing subject of the verb ANNUIT was construed to be God, and the motto has been translated in more recent Department
publications - in the perfect tense - as &quot;He (God) has favored our undertakings&quot;.<br>
<br>
P90. NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM, Hunt noted an allusion to line 5 of Virgil's ECLOGUE IV, which read in an eighteenth-century edition : &quot;MAGNUS AB
INTEGRO SECLORUM NASITUR ORDO&quot;.  Hunt translated this line as &quot;The great series of ages begins anew&quot; and translated the motto as &quot;a new order of
centuries.&quot;  More recently, &quot;a new order of the ages.&quot;<br>
<br>
P91.  Hunt stated that the words ANNUIT COEPTIS NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM had &quot;commonly been taken as one motto, meaning
<i> 'the new series of ages is
favorable to our undertakings'</i>&quot;, but he pointed out that it was evident from Thomson's comments that the
&quot;intention was to have two mottoes.&quot;</font></p>
