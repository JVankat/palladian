Peter A. Rice, Jr., appointed to fill a vacant seat last September, will be filling out a three-year term while Jeri Chapman and Racquel &#8220;Kelly&#8221; Frank are running to fill the seats of Emil Meister, the current board president, and Mary Keeler Daly, who was elected last May to fill out a single remaining year on a board term. Both seats are for five years. The 2011-12 Hudson City School District budget, as approved by the Board of Education, April 11, totals $41,249,180 (an increase of less than one percent) representing a 9.8 percent tax levy increase (with major losses in state school aid).

Jamie Larson in the Register-Star gets a chance to relay a dramatic moment from last Thu., Apr. 28&#8242;s meeting of the Hudson Common Council&#8217;s legal committee. First Ward Alderwoman Geeta Cheddie was challenging the residency of Timothy Rodgers, her likely future opponent for her alderman seat. Cheddie has not said whether she will seek reelection, and the Hudson City Democratic Committee endorsed Rodgers. At the last formal meeting of the Common Council Rodgers was briefly considered for commissioner of deeds, but when Cheddie noted he lives in Athens, the nomination was withdrawn. Larson&#8217;s story says Rodgers has been attempting to move to Hudson, and should do so by election day, when Hudson law says a candidate must live in the ward. At the legal committee meeting last week Cheddie asked City Attorney John Connor if Rodgers should be censured for filing a false article. From Larson&#8217;s story:<br />
<blockquote>“I think he should be censured, certainly,” Cheddie said.</p>
<p>Cheddie did not receive support on the idea from her fellow committee members, or the sparse crowd, which included [Victor] Mendolia [Hudson Democrat, who endorsed Rodgers], the commissioner of deeds who signed off on Rodgers’ application.</p>
<p>“I don’t think a censure is in order,” said Committee Chair Ellen Thurston, Third Ward alderwoman, “He didn’t do this with malice.”</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t he withdraw (his application) then?” Cheddie asked.</p>
<p>Council President Donald Moore said he felt a censure was unnecessary, adding that Rodgers’ name was removed from the list of appointments.</p>
<p>“Only on my objection,” Cheddie said, asking the others later why they should let this slide because it was just a little issue.</p>
<p>Connor said he would look to see if there were grounds for a censure.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.columbiapaper.com/index.php/the-news/1983-by-emilia-teasdale">Chatham&#8217;s new process yields plan for flat levy</a><br />
Emilia Teasdale in The Columbia Paper reports the new regime in Chatham turned around a budget that was going to yield a 17.8 percent tax increase, to a zero tax increase. In March, Tom Curran beat 20-year incumbent Mayor Paul Boehme, with a successful running mate, Trustee Joanne DelRossi, also running on the Chatham United Party line, promising more transparency in government. Curran held three budget hearins, Teasdale reports, cutting $137,000 from Police and Public Works departments and $40,000 from the Department of Public Works. <a href="http://www.columbiapaper.com/index.php/the-news/1983-by-emilia-teasdale">Read the whole story in The Columbia Paper.</a></p>
<p><strong>Columbia County schools receive major grant for arts and humanities</strong><br />
A $200,000 donation for the Chatham, Germantown, Kinderhook/Ichabod Crane, New Lebanon, Hudson, and Taconic Hills school districts will create The Columbia Arts and Humanities Project, the <a href="http://berkshiretaconic.org/">Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</a> announced Fri. Apr. 29. The Berkshire foundation is working with The Ellsworth Kelly Foundation to establish Arts and Humanities Funds for all six public school districts in Columbia County with over $1 million for the project. “This is an extraordinary initiative that is having a profound impact on our schools,” said Jennifer Dowley, president of Berkshire Taconic. “Now, students from the smallest and most isolated of Columbia County’s school districts, or from the most troubled, have the opportunity to participate in world-class arts and humanities programs. This can’t help but make a difference. Columbia County is indeed fortunate to have such a committed and enlightened donor.”</p>

Nicholas Confessore in The New York Times reports some startling statistics from a series of audits of the New York State budget nearing completion under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo:<br />
* More than a million square feet of state office space, sits empty while some state agencies continue to lease new spaces as recently as December.<br />
* The government data center at 40 North Pearl St. in Albany is one of four centers that back up each other in case of a natural disaster, but all are within a few miles of each other.<br />
* State agencies operate 850 toll-free numbers, almost half of which have not been dialed in months, but cost millions of dollars to operate.<br />
* 1,719 vendors supply New York’s state government with pens, paper and paper clips.<br />
“We’re a $100 billion-plus corporation that has squandered its buying power, has no standardization across business units and does not reward efficiency,” said Howard Glaser, the director of state operations charged by Cuomo to find waste in the state budget, in the story. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/nyregion/audits-find-widespread-waste-in-albany-spending.html?_r=1&#038;&#038;pagewanted=all">Read the entire story in The New York Times.</a></p>

Melanie Lekocevic reports in the Greene County News that architects will soon begin meeting with the seniors that use the Coxsackie Senior Center about what they want in a $400,000 renovation paid for by state grants. The Greene County Department for the Aging serves on-site meals, and facilitates Meals on Wheels for homebound seniors in the former Knights of Columbus building. And the Center also hosts other senior activities, and special events such as town meetings with local congressmen. Renovation work should begin this summer, when the food services will be temporarily moved to another location. <a href="http://www.thedailymail.net/articles/2011/04/28/greene_county/news/doc4daddb77a09d7884916679.txt">Read the whole story in the Greene County News.</a></p>

Gail Heinsohn in the Chatham Courier writes that RISA Management Corp., has moved into the former Ceramaseal building on Route 20 in New Lebanon, and is looking to hire 30 more employees, according to Operations Manager Jeff McCumber at the April 20 Planning Board meeting. The company manufactures large-scale metal projects such as stairs, railings, windscreens, and canopies, for pedestrian shelters, train stations and other applications. &#8220;Ceramaseal manufactured adhesives and coatings for use in &#8216;high temperature environments,&#8217; according to the website of the company, now known as CeramTec,&#8221; Heinsohn writes. &#8220;While information about the chemicals used in the process was not readily available, according to Town Supervisor Margaret Robertson, there were spills and leakage sufficient that a nearby pond &#8216;didn’t freeze in the winter.&#8217; Acting Planning Board Chair Trina Porte asked the company’s representatives whether the water at the facility had been tested. &#8216;We don’t drink the water,&#8217; McCumber said. &#8216;We have signs everywhere. We provide bottled water.&#8217;&#8221; <a href="http://registerstar.com/articles/2011/04/28/chatham_courier/news/doc4db73adaf3e77947611617.txt">Read the entire story in the Chatham Courier.<br />

Michael Ryan reminds readers that the <a href="http://www.lexingtonny.com/">Town of Lexington</a> loses out on a $9.1 million block grant for infrastructure improvements if they do not act by May 6. The town needs, &#8220;to inform the Catskill Watershed Corporation if they wish to enter the pre-construction phase of the controversial sewer project which is being financed by the Department of Environmental Protection,&#8221; according to Ryan. A landowner was unwilling to sell land needed, as the town believed it needed a large area for the system. But Town supervisor Greg Cross recently discovered Hillsdale utilizes a recirculating textile filtration sewer system, with nearly double the treatment capacity recommended for Lexington with roughly one-third of the annual operation and maintenance expenses. Town board members meet on May 3 to decide how to proceed. <a href="http://www.thedailymail.net/articles/2011/04/28/windham_journal/news/doc4db6d603dd365248908623.txt">Read the entire story in the Windham Journal.</a></p>

Apr. 27 meeting of the Columbia County Board of Supervisors Public Works Committee that discussed the purchase of the old Wal-Mart building, the addition to the county courthouse to make the building Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant, and the sale of the Ockawamick school. Osterink says the board moved forward with a loan to the Capital Resources Corporation (CRC) that would enable CRC to pursue their plan to purchase and rehab the abandoned big box store as county offices. &#8220;CRC needs $80,000 for an additional deposit payment due sometime in June and $500,000 for architectural programming and design,&#8221; Osterink writes, implying this was approved at the meeting. &#8220;Kinderhook Supervisor Pat Grattan abstained from the vote to move the resolution forward because there was no information about architects,&#8221; she writes, but says she (and Board Supervisor Roy Brown who was at the meeting but kept mum) knows that Urbahn Architects of New York City was hired through a public process to, &#8220;assess the space needs of county departments, analyze interdependency among departments, compare options for providing suitable office space, and identify a preferred option.&#8221; Osterink also reports that the plans for an addition to the Columbia County Courthouse to make it ADA compliant are complete. Public Works Commissioner Dave Robinson, she reports, said the county will apply for an exemption from review by the Hudson Planning Commission and the Historic Preservation Commission. At the end of the meeting, Osterink reports, Greenport Supervisor Ed Nabozny said a resolution needed to come out of the Public Works Committee to put the Ockawamick building on the market immediately, which was was proposed, and accepted unanimously. <a href="http://gossipsofrivertown.blogspot.com/2011/04/of-county-plans-and-buildings.html">Read the entire story in The Gossips of Rivertown.</a></p>

Photo by Tom Roe.</p></div>Over a hundred people filled the Cairo Elementary theater Tue., Apr. 26 for a public hearing about the town&#8217;s proposed zoning law. Three years in the making, <a href="http://www.planningbetterplaces.com/cairo">the proposed law</a> was almost universally loathed by the speakers, who each got five minutes to sound their views. Only two comments all night could be interpreted as in favor of the law, although many said they were in favor of zoning, just not this way. Almost every speaker cited the 160-plus page count of the document, but few quoted specific passages, as one speaker noted. Most said they felt like government was too restrictive in general. Many said Cairo does not enforce rules on the books now, and questioned why one would add more rules in that case. WGXC recorded the public hearing. Below are two clips that are fairly representative of most of the speakers. WGXC will air the public hearing tonight at 7 p.m. on 90.7-FM and wgxc.org.<br />

Then-U.S. Rep. Scott Murphy announced the grant last year, claiming that the towns of Ashland, Jewett, Lexington, Cairo, Catskill, Windham, Coxsackie and New Baltimore in Greene County, and Austerlitz, Copake, Claverack, Ghent, Chatham, Hillsdale and Taghkanic in Columbia County would get help for rural customers seeking better Internet connections. In trying to get a local internet connection at his Taghkanic house, Pratt gets a visit from his cable guy in his account. &#8220;According to Mid-Hudson engineer David Fingar, the company has since decided not to tap into these funds—at least for the moment,&#8221; Pratt writes. &#8220;Asked why (during a cordial visit to my property recently, after I&#8217;d placed multiple calls over the past three months to MHC about availability in my area), Fingar stated that there were “too many conditions attached” to the funding, but did not rule out accessing the funds later.&#8221; Mid-Hudson&#8217;s franchise with the city of Hudson is up for renewal this year. <a href="http://www.sampratt.com/sam/2011/04/mh-cable-looking-gift-horse-in-mouth.html">Read the entire post at Sam Pratt.</a></p>

Jamie Larson in the Register-Star reports from the opening of the Hudson chapter of the Daughters of The American Revolution&#8217;s new exhibit “One Nation.” The show, at the Robert Jenkins House at 113 Warren St. in Hudson Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., coincides with the national observance of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War this year. The exhibit includes the flag, &#8220;carried into battle by the local boys of the 128th on May 27, 1863. The battle, fought coincidentally enough at Port Hudson along the Mississippi River in Louisiana was a bloody one and Columbia County [forces] sustained many losses, including the companies commander Colonial David Cowles,&#8221; Larson writes. <a href="http://www.registerstar.com/articles/2011/04/25/news/doc4db481dbab3f5696915185.txt">Read the rest of the story in the Register-Star.</a></p>

Amy Griffin delves back to a time in Hudson before art galleries. Twenty years ago Carrie Haddad helped open the first one, Warren Street Gallery, there, and gets her story told on the anniversary. Haddad now has two, <a href="http://carriehaddadgallery.com/">Carrie Haddad Gallery</a> and <a href="http://carriehaddadgallery.com/index.cfm?method=Photography.CurrentExhibit">Carrie Haddad Photographs</a>, and the town has 16. Haddad says now the arts in Columbia County help drive the economy. &#8220;Hudson is becoming a cultural hub. If the county could just recognize the income generated by the arts, they would embrace Hudson,&#8221; Haddad tells Griffin in the Times-Union. &#8220;20th Anniversary Exhibition&#8221; with David Paulson, Allyson Levy, Louise Laplante, John Cross, Vince Pomilio, Darshan Russell, and David Halliday is at Carrie Haddad Gallery through May 29. <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/default/article/Carrie-Haddad-Gallery-in-Hudson-celebrates-20-1345226.php">Read more in the Times-Union.</a></p>

Andrew Amelinckx writes in the Register-Star about ways in which the shuttering of the Valatie Village Court &#8220;has resulted in a number of charges brought by the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office and the State Police being tossed out.&#8221; Even though the county District Attorney’s Office is saying charges can be brought again, similar concerns are rising in other communities that have merged courts, such as Athens, as well as other villages looking at consolidating services or actually dissolving. Ten cases have been dismissed to date.</p>

Carole Osterink reports in her Gossips of Rivertown blog on this past week&#8217;s Hudson Zoning Board of Appeals meeting where setback and lot coverage variances were granted for longstanding plans to build four Greek Revival homes in a vacant lot on the corner of Union and First streets. Those speaking in favor of the project noted that it would bring life to a part of town that feels abandoned. Those opposed had concerns about stormwater runoff and density of buildings within an established neighborhood.</p>

Mid Hudson News Network reports that a driver in Hudson has been charged with violating the state’s new “move over” law. On Thursday, April 21, they note, a trooper was conducting a traffic stop on Fairview Avenue when his right arm was struck by the side view mirror of a passing car. Bart Delaney, 36 of Hudson, was ticketed for violating the new state “move over” law as well as for operating his vehicle with an expired and suspended license. Delaney was also charged with unlawful possession of marijuana.  He was wanted by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office for a navigation law warrant and was turned over to the custody of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.              </p>

The Register-Star is running a press release from Cornell Cooperative Extensions of Columbia and Greene Counties about how they have suspended local implementation of a statewide nutrition education program due to a drastic funding cut from the Federal Government. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-ED), known in New York state as Eat Smart New York, provides free nutrition education to limited-resource individuals and their families through hands-on lessons that aim to increase food safety practices, consumption of fruits and vegetables, and physical activity. As a result of the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the allocation to New York for this program has been reduced by 40 percent for the entire project year, which began in October 2010. Due to the size of this mid-year cut, the Cooperative Extension has been forced to immediately suspend the program, which employed five educators and reached approximately 350 program families per year in the two counties.</p>

Jamie Larson reports in the Register-Star on the April 21 Hudson Historic Preservation Commission public hearing on a proposal to declare Robinson Street in the Second Ward an historic district. Local residents came out en masse, according to Larson, to put forth their belief that the designation would drive the many low income, aging, longtime homeowners and renters from their homes. &#8220;Many stated the burden of having to maintain their houses to the historical standards of the commission would make maintaining their homes impossible,&#8221; Larson writes. &#8220;Residents from and around Robinson Street in Hudson spoke out with skepticism, disapproval and at times anger against a plan proposed by the non profit preservation group Historic Hudson to designate their neighborhood a new historic district.&#8221; Supervisor and Robinson Street resident Rev. Edward Cross, D-Second Ward, has taken a hard line on the issue, saying that he believes this is the first step in a conscious effort by Hudson’s upper class to push the poor out of the Second Ward so they can gain access to the quiet, out of the way Robinson neighborhood and eventually the properties overlooking the river where the majority of the city’s low income residents live in project housing. To create a new historic district the HPC would have to make an official recommendation to the Common Council and the aldermen would have to approve it. If approved, residents would have to get certificates of appropriateness from the HPC if they wanted to get a building permit from the zoning enforcement officer for things like putting up siding, changing windows, additions to the front or the restoration of a visible roof. The HPC does not approve plans for putting up vinyl siding but does  make determinations about the appropriateness of paint color choice The next meeting of the Historic Preservation Commission is May 13.</p>

Blake Killin reports in the Daily Mail on the ramifications of a June 22 deadline within the New York City Watershed, which includes all of Greene County&#8217;s Mountaintop towns, for making changes to town&#8217;s official hamlet boundaries. Lands within such designations are exempt from New York City land acquisition policies and some of its watershed regulations. The towns are notifying affected property owners and conducting public hearings explaining the proposed changes and how they might affect property owners. &#8220;Under the 1997 Watershed Memorandum of Agreement, NYC was permitted to avoid having to filter the water from the West of Hudson Watershed by imposing regulations designed to protect the water supply of some nine million New Yorkers,&#8221; Killin writes. &#8220;Part of that agreement allowed NYC to purchase environmentally sensitive vacant land from willing sellers at fair market price.&#8221; When a Filtration Avoidance Determination came up for renewal before the federal Environmental Protection Agency last decade, NYC was told to increase the amount of money dedicated to land acquisition to $300 million.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/news/2011/04/21/home-improvement-forecast-not-good-for.html">Home improvement forecast not good for contractors</a><br />
The Albany Business Review has a story about the longterm forecast for home improvement spending following an expected burst of activity this spring. According to a report released today by the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University,contractors, hardware stores and material suppliers are facing trouble ahead. The Joint Center points to a slow recovery in the housing market and concern over the pace of economic growth nationally as reasons why home improvement spending will be tempered. Such spending dropped sharply during the recession, bottoming out at $112 billion during the fourth quarter of 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. There was a mild recovery last year. But spending is forecast to fall in the second half of the year, dropping to $115.2 billion in the fourth quarter.<br />

Cell towers on the rise </a><br />
Diane Valden writes in The Columbia Paper that Mariner Tower of Maine is seeking approval for a new higher-than-usual cell tower from the Copake Planning Board. Mariner has an existing tower at the Catamount Ski Area on the New York side of the border and has just wrapped up approvals for a new 140-foot tower on the Egremont, MA, side, also at Catamount. The company is also currently building a new tower on the southwest side of Route 23 between the Martindale Xtra Mart and the Martindale Diner, just east of the Taconic State Parkway in Claverack. And the company is “actively pursuing” an appropriate cell tower site in Ancram. Mariner agent Christopher Ciolfi told The Columbia Paper this week that the company calls its communications towers “neutral hosts” that benefit the community by letting emergency services use the facility rent free, while leasing tower space to multiple users to minimize the number of towers in an area. “Four or five providers use one tower, rather than each one having their own tower,” said Mr. Ciolfi. The Copake Planning Board will take up the proposed cell tower at its Thursday, May 5 meeting.</p>

Melanie Lekocevic writes in the Greene County News about a sparesely-attended Athens Village Board public hearing to gauge public reaction to a tentative budget for the coming year which includes a 3.38 percent tax rate increase. While some questioned cuts to the community&#8217;s growing cultural center, which offers art classes and numerous performances and events, Mayor Andrea Smallwood noted, “We are going to try to get that down&#8230; This is a draft budget &#8211; we are still reviewing it.”</p>

John Mason writes in the Register-Star that Kinderhook Town Highway Superintendent John Ruchel has noted that his highway crew is about two weeks behind on spring tasks such as brush pickup and road cleaning. “This winter was huge,” he said. “The snow never left the ground after December. Every week there were potential weather threats.” Meanwhile, meteorologist Thomas Wasula of the National Weather Service in Albany said that this winter’s 87.2 inches of snow, measured at Albany Airport, is 14th on the all-time list, which goes back to 1885. It was 25 inches above the average snowfall of 62.7 inches. It was the heaviest snowfall since the 105.4 inches recorded in 2002-2003, and not far behind the 94.2 inches that fell in 1992-1993.</p>

Jamie Larson of the Register-Star reports of new concerns that Democratic 1st Ward Alderman candidate Timothy Rodgers, who was set to be appointed to a city commissioner of deeds position earlier this week, does not actually live in Hudson, but in the Greene County town Coxsackie. &#8220;The council decided that while they looked into the discrepancy they would vote to amend the appointment resolution to remove Rodgers’ name,&#8221; Larson writes, noting the discovery that all such appointees must either live in the city of Hudson or work in the city. If they just work in Hudson they must live within Columbia County. &#8220;Immediately when I found out I called Victor and others,” said Rodgers, adding that the rental arrangement he had been banking on fell through last week. “I am actively pursuing finding permanent residence in Hudson.” Victor Mendolia, the Hudson Democratic Party chairman and WGXC programmer (@Issue, on Wednesdays at 10:00 AM) is quoted saying that he didn&#8217;t know that just working in Hudson did not qualify Rodgers for the position. “I as a commissioner of deeds just have to witness that he is who he says he is. There’s nothing fishy about it at all,” Mendolia is quoted saying, along with his opinion that the complaints against Rodgers were political in nature.</p>

The motion passed despite the new mayor&#8217;s objections. I’m not ready to approve this until we’ve gone through the budgeting process,” said Curran.</p>

Michael Ryan writes in the Windham Journal on the saving of music and chorus programs in the proposed Windham-Ashland-Jewett Central budget, set to be voted on May 17. &#8220;A larger than normal-sized crowd of residents, parents, teachers and students showed up for the school board’s passage of the annual financial package which over the past few springs has provided little if any fanfare,&#8221; Ryan writes. &#8220;School superintendent John Wiktorko expressed satisfaction with the budget and the budget process, saying &#8216;a lot of hard work went into making sure we would continue to provide strong programming for our students in a way that is sustainable by the community.&#8217;” School board members did not take comments or questions from the public, only passing the budget and making a few appointments. More issues are expected to arise when a public hearing on the spending plan is held on May 10.</p>

Colin DeVries reports in the Daily Mail that an installment payment plan for delinquent taxpayers has been approved by county lawmakers after several months of discussion. The payment option, which would allow property owners to pay off delinquent taxes over a period of one or two years, was approved by the Greene County Legislature on April 20 and will hopefully relieve taxpayer burden while recapturing delinquent funds, says Greene County Treasurer Peter Markou. Terms of the installment agreement include only one installment plan per person or business, a 25 percent down payment on owed taxes, quarterly payments over a two- or one-year period, interest and fees calculated into payment plan from date of down payment, and no late additions of parcels or tax years after entering into installment agreement. If a taxpayer defaults on the agreement they are not eligible for other installment plans for two years. County lawmakers unanimously approved the measure. </p>

Francesca Olsen of the Register-Star asks what&#8217;s up with plans to build a new Claverack Town Hall on county property adjacent to the former Ockawamick School in Philmont, which Columbia County purchased in 2008. &#8220;Now that the idea of selling Ockawamick has been put on the table by BOS Chairman Roy Brown, R-Germantown, as part of a new all-encompassing office consolidation that includes buying the old Walmart property on Fairview Avenue in Greenport, will Claverack still get those two acres?&#8221; Olsen asks. &#8220;To date, no one knows for sure.&#8221; And while Claverack town supervisor Robin Andrews agrees a new town hall is needed, she said her heart’s not set on building one right away, nor is it set on the Ockawamick property as a location.</p>

Larry Rulison of the Times Union has a story that punctures some of the job hopes around the region&#8217;s new nano future. He writes that managers at the massive GlobalFoundries computer chip factory being built in Saratoga County is holding job fairs around the country and overseas as it seeks skilled workers for the manufacturing facility and is targeting cities that have loads of semiconductor-industry expertise already for its so-called &#8220;Opportunity Summits.&#8221; GlobalFoundries spokesman Travis Bullard described the influx of new people into the region for new jobs as a good thing and talked about how he himself was moved by GlobalFoundries from Austin. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company plans to hire roughly 1,400 people to work in Malta. It&#8217;s constructing a second administrative building on the site where another 500 people will work &#8212; with room for 1,000 more. Hudson Valley Community College, which has a two-year semiconductor manufacturing program to train chip fab workers, built a training facility next to the Fab 8 site. Salaries will range from $140,000 for management to $30,000 for wafer fab operators. Technicians will earn $60,000, engineers $95,000. And GlobalFoundries has room on the 223-acre site it owns for two additional factories that could create thousands of additional jobs for the area.</p>

Debora Gilbert reports in the Columbia Paper about the Hudson assessment update being undertaken by GAR Associates Inc. on all residential and commercial properties. Letters went out to every property owner this week that explain the phases of the project and the goal, which is: “to create fair and equitable property assessments at 100% of full market value.”  GAR and the City of Hudson  expect to complete the process by the summer of 2012. “We promised we would do a reassessment,” Common Council President Don Moore said. “The state requires one on a regular basis. We had planned to do it with our own staff but we determined we couldn&#8217;t complete it by 2011. The state Office of Real Property Tax Services said we would have to extend it for another year.” In May, GAR employees will conduct an exterior visual inspection of each property to check other information on file. Property owners who do not want GAR to inspect their properties should call GAR before April 29. The company will use satellite maps to gather information about properties whose owners restrict access. The assessors do not enter houses except when an owner requests such a visit.<br />

Man nearly run down by ex-lover</a><br />
The Register-Star reports on a  spat between ex-lovers that ended with the arrest of a 22-year-old woman after she allegedly tried to run a former boyfriend down with her vehicle in the Walmart parking lot in Greenport earlier this week. According to police, Brittany Gillis of Hudson waited in her SUV in the parking lot of Walmart, located off of Fairview Avenue, for her former boyfriend to leave the store just after 10 p.m. on Monday. “When she saw him coming out she put her vehicle in gear,” said Greenport Police Chief Kevin Marchetto, who added that she drove at the man and stopped just short of where he stood. Gillis then allegedly tried to back into the man’s car as he attempted to get in.</p>

Debra Gilbert of The Columbia Paper has an update on the Hannaford supermarket planned for the town of Livingston, that that the company&#8217;s site engineer has received approval for the subdivision of an adjacent piece of property in order to add land for parking and other needs where Routes 82 and 9 meet. A state environmental quality review was put off until May, but Hannaford has heard from the state Department of Transportation, which called for left turn lanes to be added to the highways near exits. Delays in the permitting process mean that construction is not expected to begin until August allowing Happy Clown, the property&#8217;s current occupant, to stay in business through the summer.</p>

Adam Sichko of the Albany Business Review writes that new state data reveals that the core Capital Region has an unemployment rate of 7.2 percent, the second-smallest of 11 upstate metro areas. That&#8217;s 0.5 percentage points lower than it was a year ago, and below both the statewide unemployment rate (8 percent) and the national rate (9.2 percent). Only the much smaller Ithaca market had a smaller rate among upstate markets, at 5.4 percent.</p>

Jamie Larson writes in the Register-Star that a new outdoor market will be coming to Warren Street in Hudson starting May 21. Held in the lot in front of the 3FortySeven eclectic furniture and lighting emporium, at 347 Warren St., booth rentals will be open to &#8220;any who want to fill the visible space in the center of the city.&#8221; “I wanted to have the space filled,” said 3FortySeven manager Giovanni di Mola, who added that he does not see it as competition for the Hudson Farmer’s Market, opening May 7, as it will have vendors offering a wide range of products, and not just food.</p>

Casey Seiler of the Times Union reports that a new State Revenue Report from the Rockefeller Institute is showing strong finances for the state now, but sagging outlooks for towns and counties. The report found state tax revenues grew by 7.8 percent in the final quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter of 2009, in line with 42 other states experiencing similar income growth. Local tax revenues, however, have experienced the reverse trend with tax collections by local governments declining by 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, mostly driven by declines in property tax collections. </p>

Jennifer Patterson has a story in the Times Union about changes in the seder, which marks the start of Passover, the Jewish holiday that commemorates the biblical story of the ancient Israelites&#8217; exodus from slavery in Egypt to freedom, including the release of a new haggadah, or guidebook to the readings, from Maxwell House. &#8220;The seder (meaning &#8220;order&#8221;) is one of the most celebrated Jewish home rituals, but no two households conduct it the same exact way,&#8221; Patterson writes. &#8220;For all, it&#8217;s a chance to come together, share a meal and re-enact history. Some last for less than an hour, others go on for a lot longer. Participants read from the Haggadah (meaning &#8220;telling&#8221;), which spells out the steps with songs, prayers and commentary for the spring holiday&#8217;s festive meal.&#8221; She then notes how new Maxwell House Haggadahs, offered free at supermarkets, has undergone its first major translation makeover since 1932, with antiquated &#8220;thees&#8221; and &#8220;thous&#8221; replaced by the more colloquial &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>

The Register-Star reports that a man sustained a fall at Bash Bish Falls at 1:48 p.m. on April 17. The Copake Rescue Squad and Copake, Hillsdale, and Egremont Fire Departments responded to the scene, and the subject was transported via Lifenet helicopter to Albany Medical Center. No word on the subject’s condition is available at this time, and no further information was available.</p>

Veronica Lewin has reported in the Legislative Gazette what could be good news for Columbia and Greene counties: Westchester state, county and local legislators are calling for the closure of the infamous Sing Sing correctional facility they say is doing nothing for the community. Which could take the pressure off possible closings of other state prisons, including that in Hudson or, less likely, at Coxsackie. &#8220;During his State of the State address, Cuomo called for closing a number of correctional facilities around the state,&#8221; Lewin writes. &#8220;Closing Sing Sing would eliminate approximately 1,700 to 2,000 cells, while preventing an upstate community from losing a correctional facility that its economy depends on.&#8221;</p>

The Register Star ran a story this past weekend announcing an earlier Tuesday, April 19 start for the road work that will reduce Hudson&#8217;s Front Street to one lane. &#8220;The milling up of the old roadway will take place on Tuesday because parking is needed on Front Street Wednesday for a large event at the Shiloh Baptist Church on lower Warren Street,&#8221; the piece reads. &#8220;There will now be no roadwork done Wednesday. The surface of the street will be rough.&#8221; The repaving of the roadway will take place Thursday, April 21 and Friday, April 22.</p>

Paul Crossman reports in the Register-Star that about 200 people packed into Columbia-Greene Community College for the first annual &#8220;Framing the Viewshed: The Transformative Power of Art and Landscape in the Hudson Valley&#8221; symposium, hosted by CGCC and Olana on Saturday, April 16. The symposium featured a number of speakers discussing the importance of the aesthetic aspects of Columbia County and the Hudson Valley, the various changes that have occurred since artists first began to paint the region’s beautiful landscapes, and the importance of keeping this viewshed area pristine. The event itself focused on three different aspects of the viewsheds — artistic, environmental, and historical, and the various speakers addressed each point in different ways, using powerpoint presentations, example artwork, historical examples, question and answer sessions, and even a panel discussion. “We think that this event is the first of its kind,” said Olana Partnership President Sara Griffen. “The idea is to explore the subject of viewsheds in a serious, historical, and holistic way.”</p>

Mid Hudson News Network notes that State Senator David Carlucci (D-Rockland-Orange counties) has proposed legislation to preserve, promote and grow New York’s local farms by suggesting that any restaurant that buys produce from within a 100 mile radius of their establishment would receive tax credits, he said. Under his legislation, restaurateurs would receive a $100 tax credit for every $1,000 worth of local produce purchased.</p>

Colin DeVries writes in the Daily Mail that Shannon T. Higgins, 45, and William K. Marino, both of East Durham, were arrested April 15 in a scheme to cash a Columbia-Greene Community College check made out to Marino’s roommate. State police allege that Marino forged the name of the CGCC student on the back of the check worth more than $2,000 and deposited it into Higgins’ personal bank account. Both suspects were charged with fourth-degree grand larceny, a class E felony, and Marino was charged with second-degree forgery, a class D felony. Higgins was issued an appearance ticket returnable to Cairo Town Court. Marino was arraigned in Cairo Town Court and remanded to the Greene County Jail in lieu of $10,000 cash or $20,000 bond.</p>
<p><a href="http://educationinhudson.blogspot.com/2011/04/importance-of-school-food.html">The importance of school food</a><br />
Lynn Sloneker has a link on her Unmuffled education blog to a fabulous piece by Kim Marshall about the nation&#8217;s need to pay more attention to school food. Amongst what&#8217;s there: School food affects student achievement; Studies are increasingly showing a link between good nutrition and academic success. School food affects teaching; Many educators eat school food, so its nutritional value is important to their performance. Food affects school spending; The money earned from junk food sales benefits schools, which is why some administrators are unwilling to curtail such sales. Schools teach children about food; There’s a “hidden curriculum” in current practices, which can be counteracted by more explicit teaching (and actions) on nutrition.  School food is a window into identity and culture. Furthermore, the piece notes how school food affects the environment because of the massive number of meals served in schools every day; making up a significant (and stable) part of the economy; and school food can be a wedge issue, politically.

John Mason reports in the Register-Star that talk of merging the Ichabod Crane and Schodack school districts inched forward recently with a joint meeting of districts&#8217; board members at Maple Hill Middle School. The two districts received a grant from the  Department of State to study the possibility of consolidating services and potentially merging the districts. The study is scheduled to be completed Oct. 31.Questions discussed focused on whether the possible merger would take the form of a centralization or an annexation, with the assumption being centralization. That led to talk about school identity. Advisory committees for the process, which will each include 15 to 18 members, are still being appointed. According to a tentative timeline, their first meetings will be on or about May 3, and they will continue to meet until July 15.</p>

Diane Valden writes in the Columbia Paper that Center Hill Road (County Route 7A) will be detoured because of the impending closing of the Roeliff Jansen Kill at Brown&#8217;s Dam for replacement. &#8220;The long-awaited, much-discussed highway project to replace of the crumbling, 76-year-old bridge and resurface Center Hill Road for six miles from Church Street to County Route 7 and on to State Route 23 in Craryville has started with the posting of road work signs throughout the corridor,the setting up of a storage yard for equipment and vehicles, an engineer&#8217;s field office behind the Copake Pharmacy and the removal of several trees along the project route, most of them in the vicinity of the dam,&#8221; Valden writes. Road closures will start in the coming week. The replacement of the span will not begin until the first or second week of May. The original project goal was to keep one travel lane over the bridge open with an alternating traffic flow during the bridge construction, but the condition of the bridge has deteriorated over the last few months to the extent that the structural integrity of the downstream lane was brought into question.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrim reports in the Daily Mail about organizers of the peripatetic Catskill Regional Farmers and Artisans Market now shopping for quotes on insurance, following the village board’s April 11 decision to relocate the market to the county parking lot along Church Street. The market must be added to the county’s insurance policy to operate on its property, although Village President Vincent Seeley has said the market, which is run independently of the village and does not receive any village money, has enough surplus funds to pay for any policy updates.</p>

Sam Pratt writes on his blog that the former Diamond Street Diner, located on Warren Street in Hudson, was acquired at auction on April 15 by a pair of Columbia County organic farmers. &#8220;The new Ghent owners—who supplied the only meat served at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding—plan to add a local &#8216;farm-to-chef&#8217; angle to the usual diner fare,&#8221; Pratt writes. &#8220;No timetable for reopening has been set yet; but the diner has always been an important part of the community’s life, making this excellent news for Hudson business and stomachs.&#8221;</p>

While Capital Region publications are touting the surge of federal and private dollars coming into the Albany area for solar power development and manufacturing projects of late, Kathy Kahn of HVBiz writes about the demise of the company &#8220;that was going to take the Hudson Valley by solar storm in May 2010.&#8221; SpectraWatt, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer that set up shop in IBM’s former East Fishkill facility after making a $90 million private investment in the plant and receiving another $8 million in federal funding.  is now in the process of laying off its 150 employees before it officially closes its doors in a few weeks. &#8220;SpectraWatt and other local solar companies had shipped much of their production to countries that were encouraging solar power using government subsidies, notably in the European Union,&#8221; Kahn writes. &#8220;But harsh winter weather and an uncertain economic climate have reportedly led some countries to curtail or end their subsidized solar energy programs.&#8221;</p>

Jamie Larson reports in the Register-Star that the entire length of Front Street will be completely re-paved starting April 20, and hopefully finishing by April 22. The work will run from Dock Street on the north to the far end of the Amtrak parking lot where the city has a waste water pump station. During the process, Larson writes, Front Street will be reduced to one lane, with periodic brief traffic stops in both directions as equipment is moved.</p>

Melanie Lekocevic reports in the Greene County News about the Coxsackie-Athens Central School District Board of Education unanimous passage of a tentative 2011-2012 budget of $25,458,597, which if approved by the voters in May would levy a 2.92% tax increase on homeowners. The vote was unanimous. Most of the increase in the tax levy is due to losses in state aid along with increases in expenses – most notably jumps in the cost of employee salaries and benefits, which account for 95% of the budget increase. Amongst jobs on the chopping block to keep taxes low were a .22 art teacher, four teaching assistants, two teacher’s aides, one clerk/typist, two AIS teachers, two special education/consultant teachers, .4 English teacher, 1.4 math teacher, .5 social studies teacher, one elementary grade 6 teacher, a .5 physical education teacher, one administrator, .4 foreign language teacher and .5 social worker. Originally, one full-time social worker had been cut, but was restored to a part-time position. Other reductions remain as they did in previous discussions about the budget, including some programs, after-school transportation and other budget items.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrim writes in the Daily Mail that consolidating government services is on the minds of local lawmakers across New York, even though a new poll released this week shows the public largely split over the issue. &#8220;The Marist College poll found 54 percent of state residents outside New York City, which is mostly consolidated, favored consolidation for their local government, although support varies depending on the service,&#8221; Antrim writes. &#8220;Among the services most favored for consolidation include public transportation, at 73 percent, and road and highway maintenance, at 68 percent. Park and recreation programs, prisons and public libraries were also favored for consolidation by more than half of the respondents, while less support was aired for consolidation of police and fire rescue services. At 45 percent, consolidation on public schools received the least support.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Gas-is-costly-but-this-knowledge-is-free-1335677.php#ixzz1JUycVLBB">Tuition for veterans</a><br />
Scott Waldman has a story in the Times Union about U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer introducing legislation that would allow veterans to keep the tuition benefits they were promised under the 2008 Post-9/11 GI Bill. &#8220;Veteran students were eligible for full tuition benefits at public institutions, or they could receive up to the same benefit amount if attending a private institution,&#8221; Waldman writes. &#8220;However, a 2010 law would cap that amount at $17,500 for private institutions. Under the current rules, students at private institutions are able to receive up to $1,010 per credit hour or $25,250 for a typical full-time academic year.&#8221; The change could have meant about 1,000 students would have to drop out. &#8220;This legislation will fix this inequity and ensure that our veterans receive the full benefits they were promised and rightly deserve,&#8221; Schumer said in a statement. &#8220;It will make sure we don&#8217;t change the rules in the middle of the game.&#8221;</p>

Michael Ryan writes in the Windham Journal about a deadline drawing near for government leaders in Lexington to either use or lose a $9.1 million block grant from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to build a wastewater treatment system in their central hamlet. There is a very real possibility the money could be lost, Ruan writes. &#8220;Town board members, at a meeting last week, decided to hold off until the last available moment to let the Catskill Watershed Corporation, administrators of the DEP dollars, know if they will push forward with the pre-construction phase of the proposed sewer project.&#8221; CWC executive director Alan Rosa has given local officials a May 6 ultimatum to either take or leave the DEP offer, stating in a letter, “if the town has not passed a resolution by that date, CWC will accept that your town is not interested and move on to the next community on the list.” In the late 1990s, New York City created a priority list to improve wastewater treatment in 22 watershed communities. The New York City agency has already built systems in the nearby towns of Ashland, Hunter, Prattsville and Windham, among over a dozen altogether.</p>

Brian Fitzgerald reports in the Times Union that the Department of Environmental Conservation has set up a large trap outside the home of a woman who was knocked down by a bear in her driveway on April 13. They plan to euthanize the first large bear that is caught, according to DEC spokesman Rick Georgeson. He added that the DEC will not know for sure whether or not a bear caught in the trap is the same one that attacked the woman, but that the first large bear caught will be killed. Because the woman said she was attacked by a fully grown bear, Georgeson said the DEC will not euthanize any cubs or smaller bears that are trapped. &#8220;It basically will be up there until we catch one,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to err on the side of caution.&#8221;</p>

Colin DeVries reports in the Daily Mail that a 53-year-old Round Top woman was attacked by a bear Wednesday afternoon, April 13. The woman told police she was knocked down by a black bear in her driveway on Alpine Drive. A garbage container was knocked over and trash was strewn about into a wooded area near the home. The woman was transported by Cairo Ambulance to Albany Medical Center for treatment. Environmental conservation officers could not locate the animal when they arrived on the scene.</p>

Francesca Olsen writes in the Register-Star on how the April 13 meeting of the full Columbia County Board of Supervisors dissolved into a series of roll call votes, all pertaining to newly-created positions or the filling of now-empty administrative ones. Usually such decisions are made by acclimation. &#8220;The controversy began when Supervisor Pat Grattan, R-Kinderhook, moved to table a resolution that would have granted county Human Resources Director John Rutkey Jr. a deputy with a $60,000 salary,&#8221; Olsen writes. &#8220;The vote was split almost evenly between the supervisors, which is a rarity for a full board meeting. In the end, it was tabled.&#8221; Five other paid positions were approved by the board in other roll call votes, not including the HR deputy, which did not make it to a vote. The meeting began 15 minutes late because of a delayed Republican caucus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailymail.net/articles/2011/04/14/news/doc4da682c852a9e686651447.txt">Seven Catskill teaching positions eliminated</a><br />
Jim Planck reports in the Daily Mail that the Catskill Central School District adopted its $37 million budget for 2011-12 Wednesday night, April 13, with a 6-3 vote. The budget reduces district employment by 10.3 positions, seven from the teaching staff and 3.3 from support staff, despite protests against the cuts by the Catskill Teachers Association, district parents, and students. The positions that will be eliminated are one art teacher, one music teacher, one foreign language teacher, one science teacher, two social studies teachers, one social worker, one business office administrative assistant, a library teaching assistant, a CHOICES teaching assistant, and a .3 full time equivalent of a monitor. The budget represents a spending increase of $511,147, or a 1.39-percent increase. $480,000 will be taken from the district’s unappropriated fund balance of $2.2 million, which will then reduce the tax levy by another 3 percent, dropping it to $182,564, or a 1.14-percent increase to the tax levy.</p>
<p><a href="http://gossipsofrivertown.blogspot.com/2011/04/update-900-columbia-street.html">UPDATE: 900 Columbia Street </a><br />
Carole Osterink reports in her Gossips of Rivertown about what happened to the 652 signature Save 900 Columbia Street petition she helped organize and deliver to the executive director and board of the Mental Health Association of Columbia-Greene Counties and to the commissioner at the New York State Office of Mental Health. She notes that it&#8217;s been &#8220;three weeks since a group of advocates for the house met with Jeffrey Rovitz, executive director of MHA, and Susan Cody, who directs MHA&#8217;s residential division, to explore how MHA could achieve its goals without demolishing a historic house.&#8221; Going on, she writes that, &#8220;Not surprisingly, the responses to our questions explained why our idea was not possible and showed little willingness to alter the plans in order to save the historic house. MHA did, however, offer to give the house to Historic Hudson so that the organization could move it to another site &#8216;in a timely fashion&#8217; after the new facility had been built and the residents moved into the new building. The problem with this idea is that the house is an important element in a surviving historic streetscape, and its location, at the intersection of Columbia and Union turnpikes, contributes greatly to its significance. Moving such a monumental brick structure would not only be a daunting undertaking, but it would diminish the building&#8217;s historic importance.&#8221; Finally, Osterink reports that, &#8220;The ad hoc group suggested that MHA speak directly with the State Historic Preservation Office about their project. Earlier this week it was learned that MHA had contacted SHPO and now understood their obligations under Section 14.09 of the State Historic Preservation Act. SHPO has also been in touch with the cultural resource person at the Office of Mental Health. The future of 900 Columbia Street, it seems, is now being determined at the state level.&#8221;</p>

The Planning Commission also offered an advisory opinion at the meeting, ahead of the Zoning Board of Appeals public hearing on the Galvan Partners proposed project for the corner of Union and First Sts. to be held Wednesday, April 20, at 6 p.m. The Planning Commission is required to offer an advisory opinion, and so, at Wednesday night&#8217;s meeting, they announced that the project was not inconsistent with neighboring properties and would improve the streetscape, according to Osterink. </p>

Jamie Larson reports in the Register-Star that the city of Hudson is trying again to underfgo a reassessment of local tax values, this time working with the real estate appraisal firm GAR Associates. In 2010, the release of the Hudson assessment roll lead to a much higher than average number of grievances, a lawsuit from a group of building owners and residents crying foul about the values of their homes. That reval was attempted in house. &#8220;GAR project manager for the Hudson reassessment, David M. Barnett, said that they aim to be as transparent and public with their process as possible, reaching out to home owners, providing them with information and resources and holding public workshops to explain the process,&#8221; Larson writes. &#8220;Common Council President Donald Moore said that GAR’s bid on the project was accepted for a number of reasons but their stated commitment for community outreach and involvement was a big part of why they were selected.&#8221; There will be no major revaluation in 2011. The results of GAR’s assessment will be released in 2012.</p>

Michael Ryan reports in the Windham Journal on ongoing talks to determine a 2011-2012 school budget for the Windham-Ashland-Jewett school district. &#8220;A draft version of the budget, released by the board of education in early February, showed that the total for mandated expenses and contractual commitments represents a leap of $348,000 from a year ago,&#8221; Ryan writes. &#8220;Combine that with an anticipated $263,265 decrease in State aid and it is small wonder WAJ administrators have been searching every nook and cranny for ways to ease the seemingly inevitable pain for taxpayers.&#8221; Board of education members are expected to approve a spending package in late April, giving them less than a month to figure out what goes and what stays before sending the numbers to taxpayers for a May 17 vote.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ccscoop.com/news/12Apr/VanBuren/DELAYEDMASTERPLANFORMARTINVANBUREN.html">Delayed Master Plan for Martin Van Buren</a><br />
Mike McCagg reports in CCScoop that a long overdue master plan for the Martin Van Buren Historic Site in Kinderhook is still on the drawing boards, but has been delayed by federal budget impasses. &#8220;The first-ever general management plan for the three-decade-old historic site – the site known as Lindenwald that was home of the eighth president of the United States &#8211; was expected to be made public in late 2010, but now is on hold until later this year – at the earliest,&#8221; McCagg writes. &#8220;Site Superintendent Daniel Dattilio said funding for the plan is still in place, but cut backs among planners and agency personnel at the national level has delayed the work.&#8221;</p>

Melanie Lekocevic writes in the Greene County News that the Athens Town Council recently awarded a $93K bid from Appraisal Consultants to perform a revaluation of the town and village. The motion was approved by a 3-2 vote. The Town Council awarded the bid after four re-val companies submitted bids in response to the RFP, or Request for Proposal. Appraisal Consultants was the lowest bidder. &#8220;Supporters of conducting a townwide revaluation, or re-val, say it is a way to level the playing field and make sure all property owners are paying their fair share in property taxes,&#8221; Lekocevic writes. &#8220;Over the years, property values change and some may be paying too much, while others may be paying too little.&#8221;</p>

Gail Heinsohn has a story in the Chatham Courier about pending  questions regarding an application to build a motocross track on land adjacent to the Lebanon Valley Speedway. The application was put in to the Stephentown Zoning Board of Appeals in Rensselaer County last year for a variance for about 10 acres of residentially zoned property, to be turned into a “world-class” motocross facility, with a goal of attracting 30,000 spectators. The land contains state-regulated wetlands and archeologically significant areas.<br />

Fire breaks out in Hudson</a><br />
Jamie Larson reports in the Register-Star on the fire in Hudson this morning at 754 Columbia Street, within site of the WGXC studios. The fire occurred in the second floor apartment of the building next door to Melino’s Pub at around 10:00 a.m., Larson reported. The apartment sustained significant visible damage to the exterior side wall. Firefighters used a chain saw to cut into the roof and the blaze was put out within a half hour. It was unknown what damage local businesses sustained as of this newscast.</p>

John Mason reports in the Register-Star on the passage of a budget by the Ichabod Crane Board of Education in Kinderhook, and how the possibility of losing the local football team became the major point of contention at a crowded meeting on Tuesday night, April 12. ICC has ended up with a 3.9 percent tax levy increase to go before voters on May 17. As in Hudson and other local school districts, the board split &#8211; 5-3 in ICC&#8217;s case &#8211; in their final budget vote on a spending plan that includes the closing of two schools, the elimination of 32.5 positions, and the discontinuation of the district&#8217;s pre-K program. The matter that divided them, however, was the last minute addition of $31,000 for the varsity and junior varsity football program, Mason points out, which was also the issue that drew 9- minutes of impassioned speeches from district residents.</p>

Colin DeVries of the Daily Mail writes that Greene County lawmakers have approved the transfer of about $375,000 in unused public safety grants, with legislators encouraging the funds be put to use before its too late. Four grants, awarded to the county Department of Emergency Services and the sheriff’s office, remain in county coffers while the projects they were intended to fund are still in progress. Two grants were awarded to emergency services in May 2009 and May 2010, totaling $299,972, for “support, planning, equipment, training and exercise needs associated with preparedness and prevention activities for terrorist events using weapons of mass destruction involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive materials.” As of Dec. 31, 2010, $239,449.43 of those Homeland Security grants remained. Two other U.S. Department of Homeland Security grants awarded in March 2010 and August 2010 to the Greene County Sheriff’s Office totaled $89,750 for a “prevention initiative consistent with the local Counter Terrorism Zone strategy, and “to create, train and outfit a countywide dive team to ensure a quick response for water-related incidents.” As of Dec. 31, 2010, $71,464.13 remained between the two grants. Finally, a U.S. Department of Justice grant of $80,000 was awarded for an emergency services radio study, accepted by the county legislature in October 2009. As of Dec. 31, 2010, $61,064.80 of the grant remained unused.</p>

Emilia Teasdale of the Columbia Paper reports that the Valatie Village Board reviewed a proposed $706,905 annual budget proposed some major spending cuts at their most recent budget meeting, working to lower property taxes by 10%. Their areas of saving include closing Village Court, making lower interest payments on loans, and removing the position of deputy village clerk. &#8220;Discussion became heated over the Fire Department  budget,&#8221; Teasdale writes, noting how the Fire Company wanted to set aside money for future equipment purchases.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2011/04/13/news/doc4da5003816a47329293596.txt">Lack of county historian stirs debate in Dutchess</a><br />
The Daily Freeman has a story about how debate arose at a legislative meeting in neighboring Dutchess County Legislature over the lack of a county historian. The position, appointed by the county executive, has been vacant for three years and the issue came up during a routine resolution vote declaring Oct. 23 through Nov. 1 to be officially known as “Dutchess County Heritage Days.&#8221; Legislature Minority Leader Sandra Goldberg said designating Heritage Days without a historian is doing it backward. Republican majority members responded that there were enough historians in the county already.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrim reports in the Daily Mail that the Cairo library board of trustees has noted that it is already quarter of the way toward reaching the $100,000 local match required as part its acceptance of a federal loan and grant package to build a new public library. The money has been collected from donations and fundraisers that library officials and volunteers have organized since last year, and does not include the donation of in-kind services, which have been estimated at about $15,000.</p>

Jamie Larson writes in the Register-Star about the Columbia County Board of Elections&#8217; decision to combine two Third Ward voting districts in the city of Hudson. The change reduces the number of poll workers and procedural steps needed during elections and was announced at the informal meeting of the Hudson Common Council on April 11 in terms of its savings of $4,000 per year. According to state law, a voting district has to have fewer then 1,150 active voters in it. The new combined Third Ward district has 681, leaving Hudson&#8217;s Fifth Ward the last one split into two voting districts, with a total 1,280 active voters. </p>

The Ithaca Journal reports that a pair of state groups has launched a registry for chemicals used in extracting natural gas through hydraulic fracturing. The on-line registry makes it easier for the public to find out what chemicals are being used to extract natural gas in nearby wells. But participating drillers will continue to withhold information about chemicals they consider proprietary. The process known as &#8220;fracking&#8221; unlocks reserves of natural gas trapped in deep rock formations using the high-pressure injection of water, sand and chemicals to break up rock and release the natural gas. Twenty-four drillers have volunteered to also post that data on the registry, called FracFocus.org, so the public can find information about most of the chemicals used in nearby wells, excepting those termed &#8220;trade secrets.&#8221; The fluids used in the process were exempted from federal oversight by a 2005 law. There are proposals in congress to give the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate the fluids and require drillers to disclose all of the chemicals used. The EPA is conducting a study of the process. Initial results are expected to be released by the end of 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.midhudsonnews.com/News/2011/April/12/gov_eff-12Apr11.html">White paper says government efficiency is the name of the game in the Hudson Valley</a><br />
Mid Hudson News Network has a story about a new Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress white paper on government efficiency that suggests that consolidation is not necessarily an answer to Hudson Valley governmental inefficiencies. The white paper suggests a spectrum of options including shared services, collaborations and possible consolidations. It also notes that New York City, with over 8 million people, has one mayor, one police department and one fire department. In the Hudson Valley, meanwhile, there are nine counties, 13 cities, 137 towns, 88 villages, 123 school districts, 220 fire districts, 53 drainage districts, 114 fire protection districts, 227 lighting districts, 32 park districts, 24 refuse and garbage districts, 329 sewer districts, 238 water districts, and another 102 miscellaneous districts. That totals 1,709 units of government and special districts for a population of 2.4 million. Got that all?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ccscoop.com/news/09april/suicides/SUICIDEPREVNETIONEFFORTSONTHERISE.html">Suicide prevention efforts on the rise after recent spike in suicides</a><br />
CCScoop&#8217;s Mike McCagg writes about the apparent rise in Columbia County suicides over the past year, and a study begun in 2008 &#8211; when a record 20 such tragedies occurred &#8212; that is now nearing completion. “There is a list of 15 recommendations that will be made (in that report) and to the extent that we have resources, we are going to systematically implement them,” said Michael Cole of the Columbia County Department of Mental Health. &#8220;It will make an impact to have decentralized services, to have resources available to where people live. If you look at it, a third of the population of Columbia County lives within five miles of Valatie. If we can have a clinic there, that would be significant.&#8221;</p>

Rick Karlin reports in the Times Union on the new wars regarding a proposed property tax cap, suggesting that Senate Republicans jumped a bit early into blaming Assembly Democrats for killing any plans for the foreseeable future. The Senate, along with the state Association of Realtors and other lobbying groups, are pushing Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to bring the issue to the Assembly floor for a vote, even though it doesn&#8217;t have needed support. The fuel? Cap supporters are saying greater school budget cuts are needed to save people from still-high taxes. </p>

Andrew Amelinckx of the Register-Star notes that the Hudson Police Department has made a number of arrests within the past week stemming from domestic incidents, then charts the basic details of each case. The situations involved men breaking women&#8217;s fingers and arms, smashing vodka bottles in lovers&#8217; faces, and use of knives and threats. All the incidents were reported by the Hudson Police Department in one release on April 11.</p>

There, a 9.8 percent tax levy increase, including the loss of 27 employees, passed by a narrow 4-3 board majority. Even if the budget gets voted down May 17, the district has the option to adopt the budget as is, according to Daniel Barrett, the district’s business manager. HCSD board members Peter Meyer, Peter Rice and Elizabeth Fout voted against. Both Rice and Meyer believed the vote should have been put off for one more week with the intention of taking another look at the numbers. </p>

They include an introduction of the basic numbers, a discussion of state aid figures, and what the HCSD administration saw itself working with, and towards; Board member Elizabeth Fout, who voted against the spending measure, raising other ways of cutting costs at one point, including the cutting of days the buildings were open; and Howe outlining future steps, following the budget&#8217;s passage by the board, including ways in which job cuts could be re-addressed in the future.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrimreports in the Daily Mail that the Catskill Village Board of Trustees voted unanimously Monday, April 11 to relocate the community&#8217;s seasonal farmers market to the county parking lot along Church Street, perpendicular to where it was last year. The move is a change of opinion since Saturday, when village officials met and agreed the market would remain on Main Street this year, although with a new look. It was decided it would be unsafe to have traffic and kids events simultaneously. The proposal now needs approval from the Greene County Legislature. </p>

Carole Osterink of Gossips of Rivertown was the first to report on the June 11 Hudson City School District Board of Education meeting, noting how they voted to accept the proposed budget, &#8220;which at $41,249,180 involves the elimination of 26 positions and a 9.8 increase in the tax levy.&#8221; Four board members&#8211;Emil Meister, Jeffrey Otty, Mary Daly, and Peter Merante&#8211;voted to accept the budget; three&#8211;Peter Meyer, Elizabeth Fout, and Peter Rice&#8211;voted against accepting it. &#8220;When asked by an audience member what would happen if the voters rejected the budget, three options were explained: (1) the BOE could propose the same budget for a second vote; (2) the BOE could further reduce the budget and propose a new budget; (3) the BOE could go directly to contingency, which would mean that the budget now proposed would be the budget, since a 9.8 percent increase is within the parameters allowed bu the state for a contingency budget.&#8221; We will have more from this event, with audio, in the coming hours.</p>

Drilling foes make point</a><br />
Brian Nearing reports on the April 11 anti-fracking rally in Albany in the Times Union, noting that &#8220;several hundred people descended on the state Capitol to urge lawmakers to reject horizontal hydrofracking, which delivers a high-pressure mix of water, chemicals and sand to free natural gas trapped in shale formations deep underground.&#8221; He observed the presence of Josh Fox, director of the Oscar-nominated documentary &#8220;Gasland,&#8221; among a crowd of about 450 people who had signed up to lobby lawmakers against horizontal hydrofracking. The drilling technique remains under study by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. A decision on rules to control the practice could be released sometime this summer after about three years of study&#8230; &#8220;Also Monday, the gas industry &#8212; which defends the process as safe &#8212; wrote to the governor to ask that he speed up the DEC review,&#8221; Nearing continues. &#8220;The state, the industry says, is missing revenue available in states that allow the process, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.&#8221; &#8220;New York cannot afford to allow protests rooted in misinformation to halt the tremendous economic development activity that awaits our state,&#8221; wrote Brad Gill, executive director of the Independent Oil &#038; Gas Association of New York, which represents about 400 energy companies. Also, several Democratic state lawmakers on Monday announced a package of proposals, from an outright ban on hydrofracking to strict controls on the chemicals, some toxic, used in the process as well the large amounts of tainted wastewater that hydrofracking creates.</p>

Michael Ryan reports in the Daily Mail that U.S. Rep. Chris Gibson of Kinderhook, R-20th, called the economy &#8220;a bipartisan problem&#8221; during his town hall meeting in Windham on April 11, where he was joined by State Senator James Seward, R-Milford. Asked to respond to the nuclear power plant emergency in earthquake ravaged Japan and the role of nuclear power in America, the congressman reiterated that he remains a proponent of nuclear power&#8230; &#8220;when it is done right.&#8221; “I strongly support all renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geo-thermal but at the end of the day, when you realistically look at what we consume as a nation, I say let the science go forward,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If a community doesn’t want nuclear, it shouldn’t be forced on them. There are communities that will want it.”<br />

Gasoline prices continue upward surge</a><br />
The Daily Freeman notes what we all have noticed: average retail gasoline prices in New York have risen 8.8 cents per gallon in the past week, averaging $3.92  per gallon on April 10.

Following up on his own story, Colin DeVries of the Daily Mail writes that area sportsmen have called for a 45-day stay on fishing the Catskill Creek in order to save the fish’s sensitive spawning habitat. Six men were charged with illegally catching walleye there earlier this month and Walter Bennett, president of the Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs of Greene County, addressed county lawmakers on April 11, urging support to close a section of Catskill Creek from March 16 to April 30. Walleye season is from the first Saturday in May through March 15 of the following year.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrim reports on the latest iteration of the Catskill’s farmers market, which now seems poised to will remain on Main Street with traffic flowing through it. The decision — which is not finalized, but was generally agreed to during a discussion among village officials and several business owners on Saturday, April 8, — will see vendors moved to the parking spots on the west side of the road with traffic cones or barriers placed in the road. Board action is expected at an official village meeting on Monday evening, April 11.<br />

More charges for alleged burglar</a><br />
Andrew Amelinckx of the Register-Star reports that the case of an alleged Columbia County burglar keeps growing, with new charges being added to those already filed against the HIllsdale man behind bars since October. Authorities now believe Samuel Sampson, 39, is responsible for as many as 50 area break-ins, going back to 2009. He was originally arrested by the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office Oct. 29, the result of a two-year investigation with the New York State Police in Livingston into a series of break-ins in Hillsdale, Austerlitz, Philmont, Claverack and across the border in Massachusetts. Sampson was initially charged with third-degree criminal possession of stolen property and second-degree assault, both class D felonies. Amongst his loot were four long guns, according to the Sheriff’s Office.</p>

The Daily Freeman is running a state Department of Environmental Conservation reminder discouraging human encounters with black bears. “Typically, black bears are timid and will avoid all contact with humans,” said Willie Janeway, the agency’s Region 3 director who lives in Columbia County. “However, bears will become a nuisance and can cause significant damage if they believe they can obtain an easy meal from bird feeders, garbage cans, Dumpsters, barbecue grills, tents, vehicles, out-buildings or houses. Taking preventative action early and consistently is crucial to avoid chronic bear problems.”</p>

At about 5:30 on Friday afternoon, April 8, Gossips received a report that &#8220;two men with pickup trucks, pickaxes, and shovels&#8221; were removing the cement from the marsh. Way to go!</p>

Bill Fallon of HV Biz writes about a new study that reveals that the Hudson Valley is faced with intense development pressure that is pressuring its agricultural heritage. &#8220;Farming endures, according to the data, despite a 10 percent loss of farmland in a five-year period, with a corresponding 21 percent increase in the cost of food production,&#8221; Fallon writes about “The State of Agriculture in the Hudson Valley,&#8221; a report by Glynwood, a Cold Spring-based organization devoted to saving Hudson Valley farming.  &#8220;Perhaps the greatest impediment to small- and mid-size farm viability is the absence of processing and distribution infrastructure necessary for farmers to get their products to market, according to the report. It also documents how the industry is changing as farmers adapt to a shifting economy and to different market opportunities.&#8221; Yet there are some bright lights on the horizon, according to Glynwood, notably the diversity of markets in the region and the region’s proximity to major urban areas: </p>

Jamie Larson of the Register-Star reports on the reaction amongst Hudson reactions to the announcement by Columbia County Board of Supervisors Chairman Roy Brown that the county would be consolidating services at the old Wal Mart building in Greenport and moving out of most of its city offices. &#8220;Hudson officials have expressed repeatedly that if the county vacated the Railroad Avenue building the city would purchase it for use as a new city court and police department,&#8221; Larson writes. &#8220;Mayor Richard Scalera said he asked Brown that the relocation of DSS be expedited so Hudson can move forward with its plans for the old building as the city is under an order of consent from the Justice Department to improve its court facilities.&#8221;</p>

Rick Karlin of the Times Union reports on Gov. Andrew Cuomo expandeing the tax cap debate by saying that education funding should be based more on performance of teachers and school systems, instead of giving out money based on formulas based on wealth, enrollment and other factors. “We are talking about the tax cap,” he told Susan Arbetter on the Capitol Pressroom, “And you’re going to hear me talking about something else which I have talked about but I’m going to talk about more which is performance in government, output.” He went on to note that over the past 15 years school funding has doubled while enrollment has dropped about 6 percent. At the same time, he said, using state Education Department statistics,  there are  9 percent more teachers and 30 percent more  supervisors.</p>

Brown said the project would be an &#8217;18-month consolidation effort.&#8217; He said he plans to bring the recommendation to the board’s public works committee this month, and hopes the board will pass a resolution accepting the idea, and the property’s purchase, at its full meeting in May.&#8221; Brown also mentioned the county plans to create an express bus line from Hudson to the new facility, which would cut down on cab costs for DSS clients without transportation — which the county is mandated to pay for.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrim writes in the Daily Mail that plans for a new Hannafords in Cairo are running up against the town&#8217;s first comprehensive plan. &#8220;Although some parts of the company’s plan are likely to be tweaked as it begins the planning board approval process, Hannaford representatives say one critical aspect is non-negotiable,&#8221; Antrim writes. &#8220;They say the company is unwilling to build its grocery store closer to the road and have the parking lot in the rear of the property, which is a requirement in the zoning law for new commercial development on Main Street.&#8221; Hannaford could seek a waiver of any zoning rules before the Zoning Board of Appeals, a five-member body that will not be appointed by the town until after the law’s passage. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.registerstar.com/articles/2011/04/08/news/doc4d9e732699f15801311812.txt">Teachers’ union, district at impasse</a><br />
Andrew Amelinckx writes that the Hudson City School District&#8217;s teacher’s union and its board of education have come to an impasse on contract negotiations.The teachers union and board have met on three occasions over the past three months trying to negotiate a new deal before a current contract expires July 1. According to Jack Howe, the district’s superintendent, if the contract expires it could result in “an additional $900,000 per year” or a 4.7 percent per year increase in the district’s budget for teacher salaries and benefits. According to the teachers&#8217; union, the district asked the union to agree to “no salary increase and no movement on the salary schedule for the 2011-12 school year.” The HTA countered by asking how many faculty positions would be saved and was told it would be five of 22 jobs set to be cut. The union rejected the proposal and proposed its own plan, which the board and Howe have denigrated in public. The HTA’s proposal involved the creation of a loan of sorts, with each teacher deferring one day of pay from one paycheck a month for 10 months. The district would hold the salary and pay it out at a later date. The union estimated that this would be around $696,000, which the district could then use to pay a step increment increase, plus a 1 percent raise to all teachers. The board is expected to vote on their budget on Monday, April 11, and include the elimination of 20 teaching positions. Everyone&#8217;s expecting a contentious meeting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.watershedpost.com/2011/catskill-appeals-judges-ruling-pagan-case">Catskill appeals judge&#8217;s ruling in pagan case</a><br />
Julia Reischel writes in The Watershed Post that Judge George Pulver of Greene County has set a date for a bench trial in a tax status case that has slipped into discrimination charges. The Maetreum of Cybele, a pagan group from Palenville,  are claiming that the Town of Catskill has discriminated against them by refusing to grant them a religious property tax exemption. According the the Greene County Clerk&#8217;s Office, a notice of appeal was filed on March 28 in the tax case against the Assessor of the Town of Catskill. The town appears to be asking for a higher court to review a tough-talking February ruling from Greene County Supreme Court Judge Pulver, which the judge denied Catskill&#8217;s request to dismiss the case. Pulver will hear evidence in the case and rule on it himself on July 20.</p>

Mid Hudson News Network reports that top county officials from across the Hudson Valley are calling the newly adopted state budget “smoke and mirrors.” In a discussion among regional business executives on April 7 at the annual Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress Presidents’ Day Breakfast in Poughkeepsie, the Executive Director of the New York State Association of Counties, Stephen Acquario, complained that the state was passing off its bills to counties and towns. &#8220;When the state mandates that the counties must pick up the tab on various services, it destroys their autonomy and siphons significant dollar amounts out of the communities that need that money the most,&#8221; he said.</p>

Francesca Olsen of the Register-Star and WGXC&#8217;s @ Issue news show  reports that Columbia County paid out $17,506.55 to the Board of Supervisors for mileage reimbursement in 2010. Sixteen supervisors received mileage reimbursement, mostly for traveling to Hudson for county committee meetings. They were reimbursed at 50 cents per mile, at an average of $1,094 each. &#8220;The county’s current vehicle use policy does not lay out specific mileage-logging requirements for supervisors and the supervisors queried for this story were not aware of a BOS-specific policy,&#8221; Olsen writes. &#8220;A new policy&#8230; is expected to be adopted in the next few months.&#8221; She adds that Board of Supervisors Chairman Roy Brown, R-Germantown, did not log mileage because he has his own county-issued vehicle.</p>

Mid Hudson News Network has an update of where we stand in terms of our state&#8217;s crumbling bridge infrastructure. They report that of 17,365 bridges in the State of New York, 12 percent are structurally deficient. Columbia County has the largest number of deficient bridges in the region at 18 percent. Ulster County is at 14 percent, Dutchess has 13 percent, and Greene is at about 12 percent. &#8220;Structurally deficient means they are in need of immediate attention. They need to be monitored more closely because they are starting to deteriorate in ways that could become critical,” said Transportation for America organization spokesman David Goldberg. “It doesn’t mean they will fall down tomorrow, but it does mean that if they are not taken care of, then they will be weight restricted, heavy vehicles won’t be allowed to go across them. Then they usually narrow it down to maybe only one lane of traffic at a time can go across and then ultimately they close the bridge.” The average life of a bridge is 50 years; New York’s bridges average 46 years old.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrim writes in the Daily Mail that Hannaford made its first appearance before the Cairo planning board on Wednesday, April 6, introducing a sketch plan and other details of its proposed new supermarket. Representatives unveiled the company’s plan for a 36,000-square-foot store and pharmacy and 6,000-square-foot retail center to be built in the Great American plaza, whose owner, Ellsworth “Unk” Slater, has agreed to a buyout. The company’s plan calls for subdividing the roughly seven-acre parcel and carrying out a two-phased construction effort, eventually replacing the current Great American plaza.</p>

John Mason writes in the Register-Star about the latest development in the budget process at Ichabod Crane School District in Kinderhook, which has already seen a decision to close two elementary schools and trim staff by 32.5 positions. Now the projected tax levy hike for the coming school year is at 3.9 percent and Superintendent Lee Bordick said that&#8217;s partly because of state aid figures being better than expected, and partly because he originally overestimated expenses. He added, however, that he didn&#8217;t see rehiring of staff or keeping schools open. Those decisions were based on declining enrollment, he adds, and not budget considerations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Will-a-Robin-Hood-save-Nottingham-timeshare-1326261.php">Will a Robin Hood save Nottingham timeshare?</a><br />
Cathy Woodruff of the Times Union has a piece about the bankruptcy of Catskills&#8217;s Friar Tuck Resort in terms of its time share owners at Nottingham Village. She focuses on one couple who used their timeshare apartment to trade/rent for vacations they would take elsewhere. For a $300 yearly maintenance fee, plus a $150 exchange fee each year; apartment owners could rent their spaces or trade for use of similar timeshares in other locations. But now that the Friar Tuck is in bankruptcy, it is unclear whether hundreds who bought into Nottingham Village will have anything to show for their money when the Chapter 7 liquidation process is done. Two attempted bankruptcy sales of the resort complex by Ulster Savings Bank, which foreclosed on a $3.5 million Friar Tuck mortgage last September, have failed. In both cases, winning bidders walked away after a closer look at the property.</p>

Doron Tyler Antrim of the Daily Mail reports on a recently formed organization that is planning an expansion of mountain biking trails in the Cairo hamlet of Round Top. The Round Top Mountain Biking Association will host a public meeting at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, April 6  at Blackhead Mountain Lodge on Crows Nest Road. Frank Maguire, mid-Atlantic regional director for the International Mountain Biking Association, will be the meeting’s guest speaker. The project calls for building new biking trails in the hamlet for recreational use and competitions,and eventually wants to connect all the trails, linking them with the area’s resorts as a boost to the local economy. Riedlbauer’s Resort and Winter Clove Inn, both in Round Top, have hosted competitive mountain bike races in the past. And last summer, for the first time in the U.S. since 2005, the Mountain Bike World Cup was held not far from Round Top at Windham Mountain.</p>

Andrew Amelinckx has an update on the case of Father Francis G. McCloskey, who was arrested and jailed on April 4 following a “low speed chase” that lasted for about 10 minutes. He notes that the suspicions that led to the chase involved an overdue rent-a-car. When apprehended McCloskey, the former Copake Falls parish priest, now living in the Greene County community of Purling, “seemed dumbfounded” and was somewhat incoherent, according to police. It turns out he has previous traffic counts in Hudson and Onandaga County. The priest was charged with third-degree fleeing an officer in a motor vehicle, a class A misdemeanor, and reckless driving and  remanded to jail in lieu of $1,000 cash or $2,000 bail bond pending further court action. McCloskey remained incarcerated as of press time. Kenneth Goldfarb, spokesman for the Albany Diocese, called the situation with the retired priest “gravely unfortunate.” McCloskey has been associated with Oh, Saratoga!. </p>

The Daily Freeman has a police blotter item on a Greene County man sentenced to 18 years in state prison for felony sale and possession of crack cocaine. Clide Wilson, 53, was found guilty of one count of criminal sale of crack cocaine and two counts of criminal possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell in January, following a trial before Greene County Judge George Pulver.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_17780116">EPA: Housatonic not natural</a><br />
Trevor Jones of the Berkshire Eagle has a fascinating story about new views of the Berskshire&#8217;s main river in Western Massachusetts. &#8220;The dimensions and pattern of the Housatonic River are unsustainable after centuries of man-made changes, according to river experts &#8212; one of a number of factors that may play a role in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s future remediation efforts of the area,&#8221; he writes. The statement came at the first of three nights of workshops designed to relay the agency’s perspective on the history of the river, the impact of PCBs and the cleanup options for the river. Richard DiNitto, one of the EPA’s speakers, went over the history of the river, and how humans have impacted it in recent centuries. What appears to be a naturally occurring river, he said, is one that has actually been channeled and dammed, while industrialization and deforestation have also played a role in the condition of the river. These changes, along with other factors, are impacting the flow and surrounding ecology of the river, according to Keith Bowers, president and founder of Biohabitats, a company that specializes in environmental restoration, conservation planning and regenerative design.</p>

The Albany Times Journal reports that Cornell University researchers say  New York’s maple industry could be increased by $80 million yields from its current level; of $12 million in annual revenue. New York producers tap less than 1 percent of all available maple trees, says Michael Farrell, director of Cornell’s Uihlein Forest,a 200-acre, 5,000-tap maple research and extension center in Lake Placid. He was speaking in backing of Sen. Charles Schumer’s Maple Tap Act, which is part of the 2012 Farm Bill. The bill would provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture access to $20 million a year in grants to support maple research, education, marketing and business development. The idea is to make New York a  greater competitor to Quebec, which controls 80 percent of the global maple syrup market. There, 40 million trees are tapped each year, compared with 1.8 million trees in New York. “It makes sense to invest in an industry that is sustainable, has high returns and that has a growing demand currently being supplied by another country,” Farrell said.</p>

WGXC is on 90.7-FM now, at full-power, 3300 watts. We cover all parts of Greene County except parts of the mountaintop, and all of Columbia County except for a bit of Western Columbia County south of Germantown. We have heard reports that the signal is getting from Deleware County to Great Barrington, from Selkirk to Saugerties, from Pine Plains to north to at least the I-90 extension.</div>
