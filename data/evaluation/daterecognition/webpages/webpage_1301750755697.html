     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, said Tuesday that she is "seriously considering" challenging Sen. Barbara Boxer's reelection bid in 2010.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old Republican businesswoman was in Washington D.C. where she told reporters, "I've had the opportunity to be involved in the political community, policy community and business, and that's a great advantage. I understand all those realms."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12038299">San Jose Mercury News</a> reports that Fiorina, who underwent breast cancer surgery earlier this month, will resume a full schedule after chemotherapy, which is set to begin soon.</p>

<p>Fiorina was a keynote speaker at last month's California Republican Party convention, but remained mum about her political plans at the time.</p>

<p>Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, a Republican, is already actively seeking the GOP nomination.</p>

<p>In a February Field Poll, Boxer, a Democrat, outpolled Fiorina, 55 percent to 25 percent. But Boxer's support was generally lukewarm, with voters almost evenly divided about whether they were inclined to reelect her (43 percent to 44 percent).</p>

<p>Boxer's campaign immediately turned Fiorina's comments into a fundraising pitch to supporters before tonight's federal fundraising deadline.</p>

<p>Writing that "Fiorina reportedly received more than $150 million during her time at HP," Boxer campaign aide Rose Kapolczynski pleaded that, "We need to make sure that Barbara Boxer has all the resources she needs to compete against Carly Fiorina's deep pockets, while showing the press and pundits that Barbara's campaign is off to a strong, early start."</p>

<p>Boxer has already raised more than $4 million for her reelection.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>    State Sen. Abel Maldonado, who faced searing political heat as a critical Republican vote in a budget deal to rescue California from a $40 billion deficit, is calling out one of his fiercest critics - GOP gubernatorial candidate Steve Poizner - in a blistering letter.</p>

<p>     In the <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-file" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/Maldonado_LettertoPoizner_FINAL_3-31-093.pdf" target="_blank"> two-page missive to Poizner</a></span>, sent to his gubernatorial exploratory committee, Maldonado assailed Poizner as a political opportunist who has contributed nothing to solving the budget crisis.</p>

<p>"Since the budget was passed, you have gone around the state criticizing it and the role six Republicans played in its passage," Maldonado wrote. "I am very disappointed that you would let the state fall into financial ruin just to win a political campaign."</p>

<p>Maldonado lambasted Poizner, a wealthy Silicon Valley executive who was elected insurance commissioner in 2006, for opposing May ballot initiatives intended to implement features of the budget plan. Poizner sent a <a href="http://www.stevepoizner.com/modules/article/list/release.php?_c=xvi9my4i5m5bm7&pi=xkg3bfwbvch8jg&id=xux4eb88h0xnql&done=.xvi9my4i5mcbm7" target="_blank">letter to California Republican Party Chairman Ron Nehring</a> on March 24, calling the initiatives a "cynical trick" and "a betrayal of core Republican principles," including "opposition to higher taxes" and "support for fiscal responsibility."</p>

<p>Maldonado, skewered by his party for supporting raising taxes to balance the budget, lashed back at Poizner for offering not a single budget cut.</p>

<p>"Where is this elusive 'government excess' you speak of?" he wrote. "Is it the six-figure salary you take (as insurance commissioner) even though you are a multi-millionaire? Is it the salary increase you took in 2007 when the state was in a multi-million dollar deficit? Maybe I would take your political postering a bit more seriously if you actually practice what you preach."</p>

<p>Upon receiving the letter, Poizner answered back with a scathing review of Maldonado's criticism.</p>

<p>"Senator Maldonado's letter is a bit like the arsonist lashing out at the fire department for not stopping him from burning the village," Poizner said in a statement released by his campaign. "Perhaps Mr. Maldonado is feeling the heat ... given that the sale tax increase he supported will begin tommorrow (April 1). ... Raising taxes is a recipe for disaster, not reform."</p>

            <p>State Controller John Chiang said today California has enough money to get through the end of the current fiscal year without borrowing any more from Wall Street. The news means the state will save an estimated $15.4 million in interest it would have had to pay on short-term note sales.</p>

<p>In a letter to state Treasurer Bill Lockyer, Chiang said the state will enter April with $1.1 billion in the bank and should have $4.38 billion on hand when the fiscal year ends June 30. The controller had originally forecast California would end March about $1.9 billion in the hole.</p>

<p>But Chiang said in the letter that three factors had combined to change the red ink to black:</p>

<ul><li>A bill signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last Friday that will change state rules so it can collect an extra $1.6 billion in federal funds for the Medi-Cal program.</li>
<li>An extra $1.35 billion in state special fund reserves that can be tapped for paying day-to-day bills.</li>
<li>A $500 million short-term loan from the Golden 1 Credit Union.</li></ul>

<p>But Chiang also cautioned that if voters reject measures on the May 19 ballot that would provide about $6 billion in extra revenues, or if the economy continues to sour, the state will be back in the hole again by June.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>   Lt. Gov. John Garamendi is saying goodbye to his senior adviser today. And whether he likes it or not, he is saying hello to speculation his upstart gubernatorial bid is struggling.</p>

<p>   Senior campaign adviser Jude Barry, who formerly managed the 2006 gubernatorial campaign of then-state controller Steve Westly, let his new boss know that he would resign to pursue other opportunities on March 31.</p>

<p>    On his Facebook page, Barry thanked Garamendi but didn't exactly offer an upbeat assessment of the campaign.</p>

<p>    "I like John Garamendi and appreciate the opportunity to have worked with him and many other good people on his team, both on the campaign and in the lieutenant governor's office," he wrote. "But at this point, I've done all I can to help him. It doesn't feel right to just hang around the campaign. I wish John and the campaign good luck."</p>

<p>    Garamendi, a veteran state lawmaker who twice before ran for governor, served two terms as state insurance commissioner and worked in the Clinton administration, has so far seen his accomplished resume trumped by higher profile political personalities.</p>

<p>    In a recent state Field Poll of potential gubernatorial candidates, Garamendi had just eight percent voter support. He lagged behind Attorney General and former Gov. Jerry Brown, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. When U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein was added to the poll, Garamendi dropped to fifth place, with four percent support.</p>

<p>    Nonetheless, he offered an upbeat statement in saluting his departing senior advisor.</p>

<p>    "I thank Jude for his good work and diligent efforts to move the campaign at this point," Garamendi said. "He has been an valuable friend and confidant and with his advice we are well positioned to continue our progress to a successful campaign."</p>

<p>     Barry, who also works as a consultant for the San Francisco 49ers' effort to build a stadium in Santa Clara, has no plans to hook up with another candidate for the state's top job. "Once I've been behind the curtain on one gubernatorial campaign, I wouldn't work for a competing campaign," he said in an e-mail.  <br />

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Former Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata told the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/31/BAIS16PMCR.DTL">San Francisco Chronicle</a> today that he will run for the post of Oakland mayor in 2010.</p>

<p>Perata, who served four years as leader of the state Senate, said he was moved to the decision following the killings of four Oakland police and the subsequent omission of inviting incumbent Mayor Ron Dellums to the memorial service.</p>

<p>The Chron's <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/29/BAK616O8CQ.DTL">Matier and Ross</a> described the decision not to invite Dellums:</p>

<blockquote>Not a lot of love lost between Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums and the families of the four slain police officers who were laid to rest Friday.

<p>None of the families requested that the mayor speak at the televised funeral - in fact, we're told, two families specifically asked that he not speak.</p>

<p>One of the slain officers went so far as to leave behind specific instructions in his emergency packet that Dellums not be asked to speak should the officer be killed in the line of duty.</blockquote></p>

<p>Perata then told Chronicle columnist Chip Johnson:</p>

<p>"I wasn't trying to be coy (on a mayoral run), but this just galvanized it for me because you just can't stand there and do nothing," Perata said. "People know what I've done to ban assault weapons and other things I've done, so they ought to know that I'm running for mayor."</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p><em>From Steve Wiegand, swiegand@sacbee.com</em></p>

<p><br />
State officials announced today that last week's bond sale was so successful, there's an extra $3.2 billion to get more public works projects started around the state, from installing miles of fiber-optic cable in San Diego to fixing mold problems in Sacramento school buildings. Lists of the projects can be found <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/funding_released/index.php">here.</a></p>

<p>State Treasurer Bill Lockyer had planned to peddle $4 billion in general obligation bonds over three days last week. But investors were apparently so hungry for the first California G.O. bonds in nine months that Lockyer ultimately sold $6.5 billion worth in only two days.</p>

<p>Of that pool of funds, $3.8 billion will be used to repay earlier loans from the Pooled Money Investment Board (which makes loans to state and local agencies for public works projects and is repaid through bond sales). Another $1 billion will go for transportation, water, school construction and flood control projects approved by voters in 2006; $1 billion to pay outstanding bills the piled up for completed projects, and $700 million to get long-delayed public works projects under way.</p>

<p>California was unable for months to sell G.O. bonds, which are repaid with money from the state's general operating fund, because of a sluggish bond market and the lack of a balanced state budget. Legislators and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger addressed the second of those problems last month, and a lack of more lucrative places to park investment funds made California's bonds more attractive than state officials had hoped.<br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>       A. Jerrold "Jerry" Perenchio, former chair of the largest Spanish-language media company in the United States, has donated $1.5 million to back two May special election measures.</p>

<p>       Perenchio's donated the money to the Budget Reform Now committee, which calls for "yes" votes on Propositions 1A and 1C.</p>

<p>       Proposition 1A would impose state spending restrictions, establish a "rainy day" fund for budget shortages and extend tax increases for two years. Proposition 1C allows the state to borrow $5 billion against future profits of a revamped state lottery.</p>

<p>       It is the second time that Perenchio, former head of Univision Communications Inc., has spent big bucks to help the ballot agenda of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 2005, he donated $1.5 million to back Schwarzenegger special election initiatives, including measures to change how legislative districts are drawn and how teachers are awarded tenure. The governor's initiatives all lost.</p>

<p>       In 1998, Perenchio donated $1.5 million as key financial backer in the campaign to defeat Proposition 227. The measure dismantling California's system of bilingual education won handily.<br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>President Barack Obama praised four slain Oakland police officers last week as heroic figures who risked their lives and asked "little in return."</p>

<p>Oakland police chaplain Jayson Landeza read the president's letter of condolence at Friday's memorial service for the officers, who were gunned down by a 26-year-old parolee. SWAT officers killed the gunman.</p>

<p>The letter reads:</p>

<p>I was deeply saddened to learn of the tragic loss of Sgt. Mark Dunakin, Officer John Hege, Sgt. Ervin Romans, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai. Michelle and I hold their families and your community in our thoughts and prayers.</p>

<p>Our Nation is grateful for the men and women of law enforcement who work tirelessly to ensure the safety of our citizens and our neighborhoods. They risk their lives each day on our behalf and ask little in return. And although the danger of their work is well known, words still fail to explain the senseless violence that claims so many of them.</p>

<p>Sgt. Dunakin, Officer Hege, Sgt. Romans and Sgt. Sakai were taken from us far too soon, and their loss reminds us that the work to which they dedicated their lives remains undone.</p>

<p>As we honor their memories, I hope each of you will take comfort in knowing that their commitment to their fellow man will never be forgotten. We will always carry them in our hearts, and their legacy of service will inspire us as we work together toward a better Oakland, a better world.</p>

<p>Michelle and I offer our heartfelt sympathy. May their sacrifices be rewarded with eternal peace.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>     It's no rivalry akin to the Giants and Dodgers. But San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom swooped into the potent Los Angeles media market last week and won a surge of coverage in airwaves and real estate typically dominated by L.A. mayor and potential gubernatorial rival Antonio Villaraigosa.<br />
  <br />
     Newsom attracted a horde of news cameras and and dealt out a dozen interviews on St. Patrick's Day at a town hall meeting attended by 600 people in Santa Monica. "He turned out more people in Santa Monica than any of the Irish bars - and no green beer was required," said Newsom's exploratory campaign manager Eric Jaye.</p>

<p>     Newsom was also feted at an L.A. fundraiser at the Pacific Palisades home of NBC-Universal exec Ben Silverman.</p>

<p>     His reach into the Los Angeles market, where Villaraigosa enjoys overwhelming name recognition and strong Latino voter support, may be a key test for Newsom.</p>

<p>     In a recent Field Poll of early voter preferences for the 2010 gubernatorial race, Newsom ranked third with 16 percent support to 22 percent for Villaraigosa and 26 percent for Attorney General and former Gov. Jerry Brown.</p>

<p>    Villaraigosa, who was re-elected mayor against a field of unknowns March 3, has made no secret he is considering saddling up anew for a gubernatorial bid. But political observers say his 55 percent vote margin suggests that his home turf voters could be lacking in enthusiasm. Newsom won re-election in San Francisco in 2007 with 73 percent support.</p>

<p>     For now, Jaye is playing down any Nor-Cal vs. So-Cal mayoral rivalry for the state's top job. </p>

<p>     "Mayor Newsom is conducting conversations in counties all around California, including Los Angeles," Jaye said. "Mayor Villaraigosa is welcome to campaign in San Francisco if he gets into the race. It's all part of California."<br />

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein may top every poll of pols as California's highest regarded political figure. But that hasn't stopped the liberal Courage Campaign from launching an aggressive assault, accusing Feinstein of failing to stand tall for workers' rights.</p>

<p>With an internet letter campaign and <a href="http://www.couragecampaign.org/page/s/WhichSide">on-line petition</a>,the activist group accuses the senator of going soft on the Employee Free Choice Act she once advocated. The legislation, pending in Congress, would allow unions to organize by collecting signed membership cards. It would make secret ballot elections optional. </p>

<p>The Courage Campaign's website says: "This is one of the most important pieces of legislation this year. President Barack Obama supports it, as do most Democrats, including Sen. Barbara Boxer...Sen. Feinstein, however, has refused to take a position on the bill - even though she co-sponsored it and voted for it in 2007."</p>

<p>The appeal is accompanied by a photo of a terse-looking Feinstein and the question: "Senator Feinstein: Which side are you on?"</p>

<p>In a statement, Feinstein said the labor bill needs additional study and negotiation due to the "extraordinarily difficult economy."</p>

<p>"I have thought for some time that the way to approach this issue is by trying to see if there can't be a compromise between the business community, the agriculture community and labor," she said. "This is an extraordinarily difficult economy and feelings are very strong on both sides of the issue. I would hope there is some way to find common ground that would be agreeable to both business and labor." <br />

            <p>With today being <strong>Cesar Chavez Day</strong>, things are a bit quiet. </p>

<p>Gay-rights supporters <strong>One Struggle One Fight</strong> end their six-day march against <strong>Proposition 8</strong> today at the west steps. </p>

<p>Author <strong>Franz Wisner</strong>, who once worked as a press secretary for former Gov. <strong>Pete Wilson</strong>, is at Borders Books tonight, signing his second book, "How the World Makes Love."</p>

<p>It's the sequel to "Honeymoon with My Brother," which details the trip he took with his sibling after his fiancee jilted him.</p>

<p>So there <em>is</em> life after state government.</p>

<p><em>THIS WEEK AT THE CAPITOL</em>: Democratic Assembly Speaker <strong>Karen Bass</strong> of Los Angeles, labor leader <strong>Maria Elena Durazo</strong> and others will kick off the commemoration of <strong>Cesar Chavez Day</strong> and the launch of <strong>Labor History Week</strong> with a news conference Tuesday.</p>

<p>Also Tuesday, the <strong>Senate Judiciary Committee</strong> takes up Senate Bill 95 by Sen. <strong>Ellen Corbett</strong>, D-San Leandro. About 450 new and used car dealerships closed down in California last year, according to industry groups, and some car buyers say the dealers left them holding the bag. The bill, among other things, would require a dealer to pay off a vehicle before reselling it. </p>

<p><em>BIRTHDAYS</em>: Assemblyman <strong>Ted Lieu</strong>, D-Torrance, turned 40 on Sunday, and Assembly Republican leader <strong>Mike Villines</strong> of Clovis turns 42 today.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger can't be happy that the ballot measures he and leading Democrats are pushing for the May 19 special election took a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-riordan29-2009mar29,0,3270078.story">gut punch </a>in this morning's Los AngelesTimes from former LA Mayor Richard Riordan.</p>

<p>Titled "California's May ballot scam," Riordan's op-ed says the Republican governor and legislative backers of the measures could challenge Bernie Madoff for "swindler of the year."</p>

<p>The governor and Democrats say Props. 1A through 1E are needed to help balance the current budget problem and help future years by creating a rainy day fund that essentially would preserve revenue for down years.</p>

<p>But Riordan says both parties are blindly supporting the approach. Democrats, he writes, are supporting "propositions that will drastically cut services to the state's neediest...after legislators increased the state sales tax, a regressive tax that places a larger burden on the poor..."</p>

<blockquote>And to my conservative friends: Will you be intimidated into voting for something you know is wrong? You should be against increases in taxes, not for ideological reasons but because they will be economically disastrous for California. The rich (and I am one of them) already have their mansions, airplanes and yachts. There is nothing morally or ethically wrong with increasing their taxes. But if the burden becomes too great, the rich will simply take their money (and the taxes they pay and the jobs they create) and move elsewhere. And it is the poor who will be hurt by such an exodus.</blockquote>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Former Assemblywoman Sharon Runner is on the move again -- from her $128,109-a-year appointment last month to the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board to today's $128,109-a-year appointment to the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.</p>

<p>"With the state's current economic downturn including nearing historic unemployment levels, the Governor is committed to doing everything in his power to help Californians through this difficult time," Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a release announcing the appointment. "In this role, Sharon will help to address the board's current workload and help more Californians get back to work."</p>

<p>Runner, a Lancaster Republican, will replace Fred Aguiar, who the governor returned to his cabinet earlier this month to replace Rosario Marin as secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency. Marin resigned March 5 after it was disclosed she accepted tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees in defiance of administration policy and possibly state law.</p>

<p>Runner's original appointment drew fire from critics, who noted she was another in a series of former lawmakers to receive six-figure jobs on administrative boards.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>With Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> and legislative leaders pressing their case for the <strong>six budget-related propositions on the May 19 ballot</strong>, the poll numbers and the reports are sure to pile up.</p>

<p>The latest is a <strong>California Budget Project</strong> report on <strong>Proposition 1A</strong>.</p>

<p>The measure, aimed at slowing growth in state spending, would also extend several tax increases and give the governor new authority to make midyear spending cuts.</p>

<p>The left-leaning CBP's take on it?</p>

<p>"<strong>Proposition 1A would not address California's existing structural shortfall</strong> - the gap between revenues and expenditures - that exists in all but the best budget years," the report says.</p>

<p>The measure, the report notes, "would be <strong>layered on top of the state's existing and complex array</strong> of constitutional funding guarantees, funding restrictions, and revenue set-asides."</p>

<p>"In some instances, the interaction of Proposition 1A with these existing provisions could <strong>result in unintended consequences and could limit the state's ability to fund programs and services</strong> that lack constitutional protection, such as health, human services, resources, and higher education," the report adds.</p>

<p>The report also lays out <strong>the relationship between Proposition 1A and Proposition 1B</strong>, an education funding measure that goes into effect only if voters approve them both.  </p>

<p>To read the entire report, click <a href="http://www.cbp.org/pdfs/2009/090318_prop1A.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>California Republican Party Chairman Ron Nehring said Thursday he will convene an executive committee meeting next month to decide the party's positions on the May 19 ballot measures.</p>

<p>The meeting comes as stark divisions remain within the state GOP on the proposals.</p>

<p>Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is spearheading the campaign drive. He is visiting editorial boards with Democratic leaders in tow, but also Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines and former Senate Republican leader Dave Cogdill, who was ousted in a caucus coup right before the budget passed last month.</p>

<p>While Villines and Cogdill have signed on to advocate for measures they helped place on the ballot, new Senate Republican leader Dennis Hollingsworth said Thursday at the Sacramento Press Club that he doesn't think they will pass. The Murrieta Republican and other conservative legislators oppose Proposition 1A, which includes $16 billion in temporary tax hikes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two 2010 GOP candidates for governor, Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner, have also come out against Proposition 1A as they battle over the conservative base. But a third candidate, Tom Campbell, supports the measure.</p>

<p>In his statement Thursday, Nehring sounded more like Hollingsworth than Schwarzenegger, though he didn't advocate for one position or the other.</p>

<p>"Taxes in our state are too high because the lack of fiscal discipline in Sacramento has been too great, and voters will have the opportunity to directly impact that reality on May 19," Nehring said. "The measures slated for the special election will have profound implications for taxpayers and the economic climate here in California, and the voices of California Republicans need to be heard."</p>

<p>The executive committee meeting will take place April 18 at the Sacramento Convention Center.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Despite polls suggesting otherwise, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Thursday he has confidence the May 19 ballot measures he's backing will pass because voters approved the redistricting initiative last year despite tepid pre-election support for that proposal.</p>

<p>"First of all, terminate violence, and terminate the poll numbers," Schwarzenegger said at a press conference to promote a guns-for-gift cards exchange program in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>"I'm here to fix problems, to fix what is broken, rather than worry about poll numbers," he added. "As you know, last year I got asked the same question about redistricting. They said, 'Well it has lost five times before, the poll numbers don't look so good, how do you know it's going to win again?' And I said, 'We will win.' And we won."</p>

<p>A Public Policy Institute of California poll released Wednesday showed voters opposing Proposition 1C to borrow $5 billion against the California Lottery and Proposition 1A to limit future state spending while adding $16 billion in temporary tax hikes. Other measures had tepid support, except for one: a proposal to ban legislative pay raises in deficit years. Voters had no qualms about that plan, with 8 in 10 in support.</p>

<p>Looking back last year, a September 2008 pre-election PPIC poll showed that 38 percent of voters supported Proposition 11, the redistricting initiative, compared to 33 percent opposed and 29 percent undecided. By comparison, PPIC's latest poll showed that 39 percent of voters support Proposition 1A, 46 percent oppose and 15 percent remain undecided.</p>

<p>Voters narrowly approved Proposition 11 by a 50.9 percent to 49.1 percent margin.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger may take comfort in knowing voters passed Proposition 11 last year to change the redistricting process, but there are reasons why it's hard to draw parallels to that outcome:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Voters were in a sour mood last year about their elected officials, but they are downright foul now. Schwarzenegger's approval rating has sunk to 33 percent, but even more importantly he has lost the confidence of Republicans, 53 percent of whom disapprove of his performance. That's a key point, as PPIC Director Mark Baldassare said yesterday, because Schwarzenegger's ability to persuade Republicans to vote for the package has been seriously curtailed. The approval rating for lawmakers has sunk from 21 percent to 11 percent since last September.</li><br><br>
	<li>Proponents for Proposition 11 faced hardly any challenge by the end of last year's campaign. And the lead opponent, former Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata, ended up redirecting most of the anti-Proposition 11 money toward his own legal defense fund and ran a lackluster opposition effort. Schwarzenegger and other proponents are hoping they will have a comparable advantage this time, but labor unions and anti-tax groups claim they will have some resources to put up a fight. The governor already lost one Proposition 11 ally when the League of Women Voters announced it opposes four of the May 19 ballot measures.</li><br><br>
	<li>Schwarzenegger won widespread support from newspaper editorials on Proposition 11 last year. He's hoping that newspaper editorials will jump on board again this year, already making the rounds this month to build his case. But the package has so many different parts that newspapers may not be as unanimous in their support this time around.</li><br><br>
	<li>Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who now directs the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, has described the package as "like a really expensive game of Red Rover. You look for the weakest link to break through and take down everything else at the same time." If interest groups coalesce around one measure -- likely Proposition 1A -- they could succeed in taking down the whole package.</li><br><br>
<li>On the plus side for Schwarzenegger, proponents will have significantly more money to spend than their opposition, assuming multimillionaires Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner stay away. The governor already has transferred in <strike>$1.3 million</strike> $650,000 from his California Republican Party account, while the California Teachers Association has committed $2 million so far toward Proposition 1B. The messaging on airwaves may be exclusively positive come May, given this advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>UPDATE (3:50 p.m.):</em> Budget Reform Now campaign spokeswoman Julie Soderlund says the governor has transferred $650,000 from his state party account. The contributions have been double-posted on the Secretary of State's Web site.</p>

<p>An internal memo from campaign consultant Rick Claussen says that his polling, based on a 30 percent turnout model, shows Proposition 1A leading 50-37. Claussen says the comparison to Proposition 11 is appropriate to dispel a common notion around the Capitol that ballot measures need to start out above 50 percent to win. </p>

<p>"There is often talk about ballot measures requiring a 50 percent threshold of support, however, that conventional wisdom has been proven wrong time and time again. Proposition 11, the redistricting reform measure that passed in November 2008, is a recent example," he writes.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> may face an uphill battle to sell six budget-related ballot measures to California voters and, as a new poll by the <strong>Public Policy Institute of California</strong> indicates, he may not the best salesman.</p>

<p>The PPIC poll found that <strong>except for a very popular measure to prevent state officials from getting pay raises during budget crises</strong> (Proposition 1F), the measures that Schwarzenegger wants approved at a May 19 special election <strong>all have less than majority support</strong>.</p>

<p>The most controversial, <strong>Proposition 1A</strong>, stands at just <strong>39 percent</strong>. It's a rolling spending cap that those on the political left dislike, while another provision that would extend temporary state tax increases if Proposition 1A passes draws fire from the right.</p>

<p>The PPIC poll also found that <strong>Schwarzenegger's own approval rating is continuing to decline</strong>, which indicates that his influence on the ballot measures could be negative. </p>

<p>"Californians are clear that the budget situation is serious," PPIC president and poll director <strong>Mark Baldassare</strong> said, "but most disapprove of the leadership in Sacramento -- the people who are providing the solutions. These leaders have their work cut out for them if they want to persuade voters that the ballot measures are necessary to address the situation.</p>

<p>The full poll can be found at PPIC's Web site  <a href=" http://www.ppic.org" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p><em>FUNDRAISERS</em>: Sen. <strong>George Runner</strong> holds a lunch at Pyramid Alehouse, and Assemblyman <strong>Alberto Torrico</strong>, who's running for attorney general, holds a dinner at the Newark Silliman Center.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The California Teachers Association wasted little time in backing up its ballot endorsements this week with a $2 million investment in Proposition 1B, a measure that would obligate the state to pay schools a total of $9.3 billion starting in 2011-12.</p>

<p>The CTA voted last weekend to endorse all six budget-related measures, but it is focusing on passage of Proposition 1B, which directly affects funding for teachers. Of course, Proposition 1B is of little use if Proposition 1A does not pass. The CTA also gave $47,500 toward proponents of that measure.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders have packaged six proposals, Propositions 1A to 1F, as a combined solution to the state's budget problems, but individual groups are lining up to support their own causes. Besides CTA, California Lottery vendor GTECH Corp. gave $250,000 last week to support Proposition 1C, which would relax lottery rules to attract more players and revenues. </p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Democratic Assemblyman Curren Price finished first Tuesday in the race for the vacant Senate District 26 seat that represents much of Los Angeles, but faces a runoff May 19 after failing to get a majority of the vote, the Associated Press reported early today from Los Angeles.</p>

<p>From the AP:</p>

<blockquote> A former Inglewood city councilman who was elected to the Assembly in 2006, Price garnered 31.6 percent of the vote, besting five Democratic opponents, one Republican and one candidate from the Peace and Freedom Party.<br>
<br>
Democrat Mike Davis was second with 21.78 percent, well ahead of the remaining six candidates vying for the seat left empty when Democrat Mark Ridley-Thomas was elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last November.<br>
<br>
Price is almost certain to win the runoff in the heavily Democratic district. He'll have to run against the the only Republican on the ballot, Nachum Shifren, who finished a distant
fourth Tuesday with 11.53 percent of the vote, and Peace and Freedom Party candidate Cindy Henderson, who got less than 2 percent of the vote. <br>
<br>
The runoff will be part of a statewide special election on May 19.<br>
<br>
Price spokesman Fred MacFarlane said Price had no doubts about winning the runoff and intended to begin the work of the senate district despite being two months from officially getting the job.<br>
<br>
"He's very confident that he will be successful," MacFarlane said. "He's not intending to wait until May 19. He wants to be able to reach out to the constituents of the 26th District."<br>
<br>
The 26th Senate District includes a large part of Los Angeles - from Silver Lake to South Los Angeles - as well as Culver City, West Hollywood and the unincorporated community of Ladera Heights. Two-thirds of its voters are Democrats.<br>
<br>
 The other Democratic candidates Tuesday were, in order of finish, Los Angeles County commissioner Robert Cole, financial analyst Jonathan Friedman, Culver City school board member Saundra Davis and management consultant Mervin Evans.<br>
<br>
Price and his allies raised more than $1.4 million, easily besting the combined fundraising efforts of his opponents. He also lined up a long list of endorsements, including Ridley-Thomas and Senate leader Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento.<br>
<br>
Price's opponents slammed him for campaign contributions from business interests and because he only recently moved into the district to run. Only a small part of his Assembly district overlaps the Senate district.</blockquote>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Driven by low interest rates and a hot market in distressed properties, sales of previously owned homes in California jumped by 83 percent in February over February 2008, the California Association of Realtors reported today.</p>

<p>The robust market in lender-owned and distressed houses also drove down the median sales price by nearly 41 percent from $418,260 last year to $247,590, CAR reported.</p>

<p>"Home sales in California continue to be considerably stronger than the nationwide sales figures," said association president James Liptak. "The market will continue to register large, but diminishing year-to-year percentage gains in the coming months, as current sales are compared against the extremely low numbers that prevailed during the early months of the credit crunch." </p>

<p>Santa Barbara had the state's highest median sales price in February, $897,000, while the lowest median, $121,970, was recorded in the "high desert" region of Southern California, which also had the state's highest increase in sales, 203.1 percent over the previous February.</p>

<p>The complete, county-by-county and city-by-city home sales report is available <a href="http://www.car.org/economics/historicalprices/2009medianprices/feb2009medianprices/" target="_blank">here.</a><br />

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>State Treasurer Bill Lockyer announced Tuesday that he stopped taking orders for the state's general obligation bond sale Tuesday after investors purchased $6.54 billion -- $2.54 billion more than the original $4 billion target.</p>

<p>The additional money should go toward construction projects around the state that slowed or stopped after officials froze California's Pooled Money Investment Account in December. A board that oversees the account last week authorized $500 million in payments toward construction projects contingent on Lockyer selling at least $4 billion in bonds this week.</p>

<p>The state benefited from heavy demand from individual retail investors, who purchased nearly half of the bond total. Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, bought the remainder.</p>

<p>California offered high yields that ranged from 3.20 percent to 6.10 percent based on maturity date. Investment experts said the yields were higher because the state's credit rating had been downgraded this month. The higher yields, along with California's track record of repayment and a nine-month absence from the bond market, contributed to the demand, said Jason Dickerson, a fiscal expert with the Legislative Analyst's Office.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The first six-figure check against any of the May 19 ballot measures landed Tuesday as local mental health agencies donated $100,000 to fight Proposition 1E, which would take away roughly $230 million in mental health funds during each of the next two years.</p>

<p>The California Mental Health Advocates for Children and Youth also donated $15,000 to fight Proposition 1E.</p>

<p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders have packaged six budget-related measures together and are asking voters to pass all of them. Proposition 1E is among the more crucial for fixing the current budget deficit because it would provide direct general fund relief.</p>

<p>Proposition 1E would take money from Proposition 63 funds that are raised through an income tax on millionaires. Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, led the campaign for Proposition 63 in 2004, but he supports Proposition 1E as part of the budget deal.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>One of California's largest public employee groups and one of its key union locals are splitting on a package of fiscal reform measures the Legislature put on the ballot to help close California's $40 billion budget deficit.</p>

<p>The good news for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers hoping for support for the May ballot initiatives is that the executive board of the 5,000 member Local 2620 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees is calling for "yes" votes on every single measure.</p>

<p>"As dedicated public servants our top concern is the ability to provide critically needed services that help protect public health and safety," said Nancy Swindell, president of AFSCME 2620, said in a statement. </p>

<p>"The failure of Propositions 1A-1F would jeopardize the services we are committed to protect," she added.<br />
     <br />
The worse news for the governor and lawmakers is that the executive board for the 179,000-member American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees is calling for "no" votes for the entire package.</p>

<p>"The spending cap (in Prop 1A) is an awful way of not balancing a budget plan for California," said Willie Pelote, a lobbyist for the statewide group. "The governor and the Legislature came up with that as a budget deal for California. We disagree. We believe the state of California can do better."</p>

<p>It seems that the split between the local and the statewide union may hinge on which has the higher percentage of state workers.</p>

<p>Local 2620, headquartered in Oakland, represents a heavy concentration of state employees, including psychologists, rehabilitation therapists, day care and senior care home inspectors and vocational rehabilitation counselors.</p>

<p>In the statewide union, only about 28,000 of AFSCME's members are state employees.</p>

<p>Pelote said that "our sisters and brothers" in the local are in contract talks with the state and want to support the budget initiative plan. He said the statewide union has no protest over the local breaking ranks.</p>

<p>"I understand the situation they're caught in if their members feel they want to vote 'yes' on the initiatives," Pelote said. "But we're taking a 'no' position. And that's what we're putting out in the press."   </p>

            <p>Days after first lady Michelle Obama broke ground on a White House garden, California first lady Maria Shriver announced Wednesday she plans to establish an edible garden at Capitol Park in Sacramento.</p>

<p>Shriver plans to grow fruits, vegetables and other edible plants on an 800-square-foot plot east of 13th Street between Capitol Avenue and L Street, said spokesman Francisco Castillo. The space currently holds a flower bed.</p>

<p>"This new garden will bring awareness to children, students and visitors about the important role of food, where it comes from, nutritional value, how it is grown and harvested and ultimately how it reaches the tables of those who need it most," Shriver said in a statement.</p>

<p>Shriver plans to work with the California School Garden Network and chef Alice Waters, who established The Edible Schoolyard organic gardening program at a Berkeley middle school.</p>

<p>"It's a project she's thought about for a while," Castillo said.</p>

<p>State Sen. Tony Strickland will join the Los Angeles Lightning for its season debut, May 2, against the Edmonton Energy in the Gilbert Sports Arena at California Lutheran University, Thousand Oaks.</p>

<p>"I'm excited about it," said the Moorpark Republican, who stands 6-feet-5 and played  hoops at Whittier College nearly two decades ago. "I'm as serious about my basketball as I am about my politics."</p>

<p>Strickland said he knows the Lightning's owner, Mark Harwell, who was aware of the legislator's love for basketball and invited him to join the team for one game, perhaps more.</p>

<p>"It didn't take me long to say yes," Strickland said.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Lightning is a member of the professional International Basketball League, which began play in 2005.</p>

<p>Strickland's teammates will include Lamond Murray, Toby Bailey, Fred Vinson and Keith Closs, former members of the National Basketball Association.</p>

<p>Harwell, a Strickland supporter, said the senator's participation will be an event for the entire community, but not a publicity stunt.</p>

<p>"If the guy were 5-feet-7 and had a pot belly, that would be a publicity stunt," Harwell said. "But he's a tremendous athlete. ... I don't think people realize what a great athlete he is -- he can still dunk the ball."</p>

<p>Strickland, 39, said he is exercising daily and playing pickup games about twice a week in preparation for the Lightning's May 2 curtain raiser, during which he expects to see time as a small forward or off-guard.</p>

<p>"My job comes first," he said of his Capitol duties. "But I'll be ready."</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>               New legislation would pave the way for Californians who are laid off from small businesses to obtain financial assistance for health-insurance premiums.</p>

<p>	Assembly Bill 23 was unveiled at a news conference Tuesday by Assemblyman Dave Jones, D-Sacramento, and by Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, R-San Diego, with state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner participating by telephone.</p>

<p>	"Quick passage of this bill is critical in order to meet the health care needs of California families," Jones said.</p>

<p>	The federal government currently offers to pay 65 percent of the premium for workers who were laid off after Sept. 1, retained health-care benefits formerly provided by their employer, and who worked for businesses with a work force of 20 or more. The aid is available for nine months.</p>

<p>             AB 23 would allow workers laid off from smaller firms, employing two to 19 employees, to be eligible for the subsidy. The state would not be required to continue the program once federal stimulus funds run out.</p>

<p>              The bill also requires health-care providers and insurers to notify eligible families about the federal aid.</p>

<p>	Fletcher said the legislation is crucial in a year of economic recession, with the state's unemployment rate topping 10 percent.</p>

<p>	"Californians are hurting right now," he said. "Everybody knows somebody who has been laid off," he said.</p>

<p>                 "It's just good economic policy to make sure that as many people as possible  have access to health insurance," Poizner added.</p>

<p>	Jones and Fletcher are chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the Assembly Health Committee, which approved AB 23 without a dissenting vote Tuesday afternoon.<br />
   <br />
                To take effect immediately, AB 23 must be passed by two-thirds of each legislative house and signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose office said Tuesday that he has not taken a position on the bill but supports using federal stimulus funds to help unemployed Californians retain health insurance.<br />

        <div class="asset-name entry-title title"><a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/03/brown-counsels.html">Brown counsels gay marriage backers</a></div>
     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p><em>From Susan Ferriss  sferriss@sacbee.com</em></p>

<p>In an unusual Monday night conference call with gay marriage supporters, Attorney General Jerry Brown offered tips to carry their fight forward should Supreme Court justices disappoint them and uphold Proposition 8.</p>

<p>"I'm not giving up on the court yet," he said, acknowledging that the justices expressed many doubts about overturning the voters' choice last Nov. 4 to approve, by about 52 percent, a constitutional change to declare marriage between only a man and a woman.</p>

<p>Brown, a likely candidate for governor next year, spoke on a call organized by the Courage Campaign, a group working to change opinions in regions where gay-marriage rights are not embraced by majorities. More than 400 emails with questions for Brown came in ahead of the call, and a few dozen others came in live.</p>

<p>Brown said that the justices "were on the attack" during the March 5 hearing when lawyers for and against the proposition debated its constitutionality. Brown decided to challenge Proposition 8, saying it violated tenets of "inalienable rights" that are enshrined in the state constitution.</p>

<p>He said that in his view, the Supreme Court justices had already ruled on gay marriage in the past using his same logic. Last May, he said, a majority opinion issued by the justices found that marriage was a basic right protected by the constitution, and that same-sex partners should not be excluded from that right.</p>

<p>Brown said he hoped the justices would stick to "the logic" of their previous ruling.</p>

<p>His attorneys worked hard, he said, to prepare for the March 5 hearing, but "our man didn't fight back" as hard as hoped, he said of his representative at the hearing.</p>

<p>If the justices uphold Proposition 8, Brown said, "it will be a sad day" and could open up challenges to other fundamental rights. The constitution, Brown said, "becomes a much thinner document" if justices were to allow a simple majority to take away "fundamental liberties."</p>

<p>Brown doubted, though, that the justices would void the marriages of gay couples that took place last summer, before they were stopped by Proposition 8's approval.</p>

<p>He also told activists he thought public opinion in California was changing fast on acceptance of same-sex marriage rights, and noted that more states may pass legislation to allow it. "If that happens, you're getting pillars of support," he said.</p>

<p>The next step, he said, would be to try to repeal the federal Defense of Marriage Act so that marriages can gain federal support and recognition.</p>

<p>Brown was asked for his "gut" feeling about when it might be the right time for gay-marriage supporters to try to put another initiative on the ballot in California to reverse Proposition 8. "I think that's a matter of reflection," Brown said, "and some survey research."</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Smokers, beware. Lawmakers will begin considering a bill today that <strong>bans smoking at state parks and beaches</strong> in California starting next year.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 4 by Sen. <strong>Jenny Oropeza</strong>, D-Long Beach, would impose a $250 fine for each smoking violation. The senator sees it as a way to protect the state's marine life from cigarette litter and reduce fire danger in forest areas.</p>

<p>Good news for Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> and other Capitol smokers: Contrary to popular belief, Capitol Park is not part of the State Parks system, according to <strong>Terese Zilke</strong>, director of the California State Capitol Museum. The guv's cigar tent can live on.</p>

<p>Republican leaders, along with conservative talk-radio hosts, will kick off a new <a href="http://www.firstamendmentnow.com/index.html" target="_blank">PAC</a> called "First Amendment Now," to <strong>oppose any resurrection of FCC rules requiring broadcasters to provide balanced views of political issues on air</strong>. The group is also concerned about any efforts to mandate diversity in radio ownership. Campaign Chairman <strong>Tom Del Beccaro</strong> will lead a rally at the Capitol.</p>

<p>The FCC eliminated the "Fairness Doctrine" in 1987. While some Democrats have discussed bringing it back, President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> has said he is against any revival, and the U.S. Senate voted 87-11 last month against its return.</p>

<p>Lawmakers will hold a couple events aimed at <strong>helping Californians struggling from the economic downturn</strong>.</p>

<p>Sen. <strong>Ellen Corbett</strong>, D-San Leandro, will convene a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and hold a press conference beforehand with prosecutors and housing rights activists to discuss scams resulting from the mortgage crisis.</p>

<p>In a separate press conference, Assemblymen <strong>Dave Jones</strong>, D-Sacramento, and <strong>Nathan Fletcher</strong>, R-San Diego, will promote Assembly Bill 23, which requires health insurers to inform Californians who lose their jobs that they are eligible for new health care continuation assistance under the federal stimulus package. State Insurance Commissioner <strong>Steve Poizner</strong> is expected to participate by phone.</p>

<p>Finally, some college students are spending their spring break in places like Sacramento rather than smoking at some of California's lovely state beaches. Fifty students from CALPIRG will hold a Capitol press conference to present California EPA Secretary <strong>Linda Adams</strong> with a green climate hero cape and raise a giant wind turbine in front of the Capitol.</p>

<p>Between legislators holding hearings and radio talk-show hosts leading a rally, plenty of wind should be available.</p>

<p>BIRTHDAYS: Assemblyman <strong>Martin Garrick</strong>, R-Solana Beach, turns 56 and Assemblyman <strong>Paul Krekorian</strong>, D-Burbank, turns 49.</p>

        <div class="asset-name entry-title title"><a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/03/more-than-half.html">More than half of state bonds sold</a></div>
     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p><em>UPDATE: Lockyer reported that the first day total amounted to $3.04 billion of the $4 billion available. </em></p>

<p>State Treasurer Bill Lockyer's office reports that first-day retail sales for state bonds are brisk, with $2.4 billion of the $4 billion offering already sold through this morning. The Treasurer's Office is conducting an <a href="http://www.buycaliforniabonds.com/">early order period</a> for retail investors through Tuesday before opening up sales to large institutional investors Wednesday.</p>

<p>The activity comes after two major agencies last week downgraded California's general-obligation bonds to the lowest rating in the nation. That forced California to offer relatively high yields for its bonds -- ranging from 3.25 percent for a 2013 maturity date up to 6.00 percent for a 2036 maturity date. Retail investors must order through a broker and purchase a minimum of $5,000.</p>

<p>Jason Dickerson of the Legislative Analyst's Office said that high yields, along with investor confidence in municipal bonds and pent-up demand for California paper, contributed to the robust first-day sales. But he warned that California won't be in the clear until it can return to the market with consistent bond offerings because the state's bond needs remain much larger than $4 billion.</p>

<p>"No doubt it's a great day for the state in the bond market," Dickerson said. "But the backlog of funding delays for projects and the need to get new projects started is so immense that the very important test will be once we get past this and see how well the state does in routine bond sales."</p>

<p>Lockyer may seek more than $4 billion in borrowing if demand warrants it, but the treasurer has not decided whether that will be the case, said spokesman Tom Dresslar. A state board last week authorized $500 million in public works expenditures contingent on whether California can successfully sell $4 billion in bonds.</p>

<p>Lockyer's office also announced that The Golden 1 Credit Union purchased $500 million in short-term borrowing notes at 2.20 percent from the state to help its cash flow situation. The state will still seek an additional $1.5 billion in short-term borrowing to get through June 30.</p>

<p>Though state Controller John Chiang said earlier this month that the state would pursue $1.5 billion in short-term borrowing through the end of the fiscal year, Chiang spokeswoman Hallye Jordan said that total represented the maximum amount Chiang and Lockyer believed the state could obtain at that time. After the latest Golden 1 deal, they now believe they can secure $2 billion, she said.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>While the large and powerful California Teachers Association has declared its support for all six budget-related measures on the May 19 special election ballot, it's much-smaller cousin (and sometime rival), the California Federation of Teachers, is going the other way.</p>

<p>The CFT, following a weekend convention, declared that it would support just one of the six measures, Proposition 1B, which would provide future payments to schools to make up for state aid cuts this year. It was especially scornful of Proposition 1A, which would impose a rolling spending cap on state spending and allow temporary tax increases to be extended.</p>

<p>Proposition 1A, the CFT said, would "create a maze of rules controlling California budgeting that would severely restrict the state from enacting budgets that adequately address the realities that California will be facing in coming years, especially the ability to address the needs of California's aging population." It also denounced the measure as a "power grab" by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>

<p>The CFT's support for Proposition 1B, however, did not address a poison pill in its language that says it is void, even if enacted, unless Proposition 1A also passes. So if the union gets its way on Proposition 1A, it will make Proposition 1B meaningless.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The California Teachers Association will support all six budget-related measures on the May 19 ballot, ensuring Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won't have to contend with the well-financed teachers' union this time around.</p>

<p>The action was not surprising, considering that CTA already wrote the ballot argument in favor of Proposition 1B, which would repay $9.3 billion to schools starting in 2011-12. The group's state council voted Sunday to support all six measures.</p>

<p>But the California Nurses Association, one of CTA's most vocal partners in the labor coalition that took down all four of Schwarzenegger's special election measures in 2005, has come out against the six May ballot measures.</p>

<p>Because of how lawmakers wrote the proposals, CTA needs Proposition 1A to pass in order for Proposition 1B to take effect. Some labor groups, including the nurses, oppose Proposition 1A because it would set limits on state spending in good economic years, while anti-tax groups dislike the fact that the measure would increase taxes by roughly $16 billion from 2011-13.</p>

<p>But CTA felt the $9.3 billion in Proposition 1B, as well as some education protections from the spending limit in 1A, were enough to get their support.</p>

<p>"The repayment of some of the money cut from education will allow local school districts to restore student programs, reduce class sizes and rehire educators who have been laid off," CTA President David A. Sanchez said in a statement. "Many of these initiatives, especially Propositions 1A and B, are dependent on each other and if they fail, the state is back to square one in trying to balance the budget and our schools could face even deeper cuts."</p>

<p>Bonnie Castillo, legislative director for the California Nurses Association, said her organization felt the budget process that led to the six ballot measures was "undemocratic" and offered no public opportunity for input. </p>

<p>She criticized the cuts included in the budget lawmakers and Schwarzenegger approved last month and said it would serve as a basis for future budgets if Proposition 1A passes. The measure relies on a trend line over the previous 10 years to determine spending limits.</p>

<p>"Proposition 1A is based on a budget that has massive cuts to social services that really are badly needed and affect our most vulnerable," Castillo said. "To have that budget as the basis for future budgets is brutal."</p>

<p>Castillo said her union doesn't have nearly as much time to prepare for the May election as it did for the 2005 special election, plus the coalition has changed, so it's hard to make a comparison. She said she believes her group's effort will be largely grassroots.</p>

<p>"The teachers are supporting it this time," Castillo said. "I don't know if you can compare it to last time because of the number of months before that election and the folks working on it together the last time."</p>

        <div class="asset-name entry-title title"><a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/03/poizners-argume.html">Poizner's argument against Propositon 1A</a></div>
     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner and former eBay boss Meg Whitman may be rivals for the Republican gubernatorial nomination next year, but there's no disagreement between the Silicon Valley denizens about Proposition 1A, one of a half-dozen budget-related measures on the May 19 special election.</p>

<p>Poizner and Whitman both oppose the measure, even though Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says it is vital to straightening out the state's tortured finances by creating a rolling spending cap.</p>

<p>Whitman laid out her objections to Proposition 1A in a recent <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/story/1704970.html" target="_blank">Sacramento Bee op-ed article</a>, complaining that it would indirectly extend billions of dollars in state tax increases. Poizner's <a href="http://www.flashreport.org/featured-columns-library0b.php?faID=2009032309462349" target="_blank">similar screed</a> is contained in an article posted today on Flashreport, a conservative blog, to wit:</p>

<p>"Make no mistake: If they get away with their latest scheme it will cost you dearly.  <br />
Specifically, the politicians don't want you to know all the facts when it comes to Proposition 1A.  This is the ballot measure that would impose a state constitutional spending limit - a concept that is supported by an overwhelming majority of Californians.<br />
However, if the measure passes, it will also extend the huge tax increases recently approved by the legislature.</p>

<p>"Passage of Proposition 1A means that the near-doubling of the car tax, the 1 cent statewide sales tax increase, the income tax hike and the reduction in the dependent tax credit would continue for an additional two years.  That adds up to an estimated $16 billion in higher taxes.  It's no surprise these taxes are not supported by the majority of Californians.</p>

<p>"That's why our state legislators want to keep the truth from you about Proposition 1A and they've stacked the deck in their favor.  So when you read the official ballot description of the measure - what should be an objective description on what is being voted on - you will see no mention of the taxes.  The legislative leadership wrote the ballot description themselves and intentionally omitted any reference to the tax increase extension.  They made sure what you read is biased."</p>

<p>Poizner noted that he successfully led the effort against a ballot measure last year that would have changed legislative term limit but, like Whitman, stopped short of pledging that he would devote some of his vast personal fortune to defeating Proposition 1A. Schwarzenegger has assembled a coalition to support and raise money for the measure's passage and are waiting to see whether any deep-pocket source would pour in money to oppose it, either a public employee union opposed to spending limits or someone on the right opposed to a tax extension.</p>

<p>The third GOP candidate for governor, former Congressman Tom Campbell, supports Proposition 1A, saying its needed to get a handle on state spending. He was briefly Schwarzenegger's budget director.<br />

        <div class="asset-name entry-title title"><a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/03/dont-divert-sch.html">Don't divert school funds, congressional Dems warn </a></div>
     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>             Congressional Democrats are telling state leaders to keep their hands off federal  stimulus funds meant for schools and colleges.</p>

<p>             The issue arose this month when Legislative Analyst Mac Taylor said that California's falling economy could allow the state to cut its school funding by about $3 billion in 2009-10 and backfill the money with federal "stabilization funds." No decision has been made.</p>

<p>              The<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/govletter.pdf"> letter </a>from 26 California Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives apparently aims to nip the idea in the bud. Signers included Rep. Zoe Lofgren, chairwoman of the delegation, and Rep. George Miller, chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.</p>

<p>              "It has been suggested that the state has some ability to intercept Stabilization Fund dollars," the letter said. "It does not."</p>

<p>               The letter was sent March 17 to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, state Superintendent of Public Schools Jack O'Connell and the governor's education secretary, Glen Thomas.</p>

<p>               Congress intends that federal stabilization funds be transmitted quickly to local school districts and colleges, which should decide for themselves how best to spend the money, the letter said.</p>

<p>            The stimulus funds are meant to "help stabilize local government budgets, to minimize or avoid harmful cuts to education programs and services, to keep teachers in the classroom, and to support modernization, renovation and repair of school facilities," the letter said.</p>

<p>           "Any delay in funding local educational agencies may have dire consequences for children and teachers in our great state," the letter concluded.</p>

            <p>Republican Tom Campbell is taking a different path in his 2010 exploration of a run for governor.</p>

<p>The former GOP congressman and state budget director sent his supporters and e-mail today with the subject line: "My new blog."</p>

<p>"Most politicians will ask you to be part of a campaign," he wrote. "I would like to ask you to be part of a vision for the future -- to help shape the ideas and policies that will lead California's comeback beyond one election."</p>

<p>So he'll be blogging. (He's already responded to one commenter <a href="http://www.campbell.org/2009/03/19/welcome/#disqus_thread" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>

<p>"No matter where you stand, I promise to listen," he wrote in the e-mail. "A vibrant and civil discussion is vital to California's future."</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>President Barack Obama cracked a joke on "The Tonight Show" on Thursday about his famously poor bowling skills by saying, "It was like the Special Olympics or something," which drew laughs from the studio audience.</p>

<p>But Obama and aides later realized he made an insensitive gaffe, and he apologized Thursday to Special Olympics Chairman Timothy Shriver, the brother of California first lady Maria Shriver.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the joke came on the same day Obama spent hours with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who heaped praise on the new president. Schwarzenegger considers the Special Olympics his favorite charity, appearing at major competitions and raising money around the world.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger is meeting at 11:50 a.m. PDT today with President Obama in the White House to discuss infrastructure. The governor hasn't said anything about Obama's joke, but Maria Shriver issued the following statement this morning:</p>

<blockquote>"While I am confident that President Obama never intended to offend anyone, the response that his comments have caused, coupled with the reaction of a primetime audience, demonstrate the need to continue to educate the non-disabled community on the issues that confront those with a developmental disability. My mother has dedicated her life to fighting stereotypes and ridicule for this community, and there is still much work to be done. <br>
<br>
"The President's apology for his comments and his commitment to bringing the Special Olympics to the White House are important first steps in shedding light on this important issue. Often times we don't realize that when we laugh at comments like this it hurts millions of people throughout the world. People with special needs are great athletes and productive citizens, and I look forward to working with the President to knock down myths and stereotypes about this community."</blockquote>

            <p>Let the campaigns begin.</p>

<p>First, Sen. <strong>Mark DeSaulnier</strong> got himself elected to the Assembly in November 2006.</p>

<p>Then the Concord Democrat got himself elected to the state Senate last November when he and <strong>Tom Torlakson</strong>, now back in the Assembly, swapped seats. </p>

<p>And now that Rep. <strong>Ellen Tauscher</strong> has officially announced that she's leaving Congress for a post in the Obama administration, DeSaulnier has decided to run for that East Bay seat.</p>

<p>What about Torlakson? He's endorsed DeSaulnier for Tauscher's seat and says he's formally kicking off his <strong>state schools chief campaign</strong> on April 3.  </p>

<p>Fresh off his appearance Thursday with President <strong>Barack Obama</strong>, Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> heads East to meet with Obama at the White House today about <strong>the nation's infrastructure</strong>. </p>

<p>Also on the guest list: Pennsylvania Gov. <strong>Edward Rendell</strong> and New York Mayor <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong>. </p>

<p><em>CONVENTION</em>: The <strong>California Federation of Teachers</strong> meets today at Sacramento's Sheraton Grand Hotel to talk about <strong>teacher and staff layoffs, cuts to school funding, and the May 19 special election</strong>.</p>

<p><em>BIRTHDAYS</em>: The candles are racking up this weekend, with no less than 7.5 percent of California's state senators celebrating their natal day. Saturday, <strong>Roy Ashburn</strong> turns 55 and <strong>Denise Moreno Ducheny</strong> turns 57. Sunday, <strong>Alex Padilla</strong> turns 36.</p>

<p><em>FUNDRAISERS</em>: The <strong>Leland Yee Golf Classic</strong> tees off today at San Francisco's Harding Park Golf Course. And Ducheny keeps her birthday bash rolling Sunday with a Chinese banquet in San Diego that benefits <strong>Camp Borrego at Anza-Borrego Desert State Park</strong>.<br />

<blockquote>A Sacramento Superior Court judge has ruled that State Controller John Chiang exceeded his authority last summer when he refused to issue paychecks to state workers that temporarily reduced their pay to $6.55 per hour.<br>
<br>
Judge Timothy Frawley's final decision confirms a tentative ruling he issued on Feb. 26. After hearing arguments by attorneys representing Chiang and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who last summer ordered the pay reduction for some 200,000 state workers after lawmakers' budget talks deadlocked. Chiang refused to comply with so-called "pay letters" from the Schwarzenegger administration that detailed the pay reduction. The controller said that he believed the order was illegal and that his office didn't have the technology to quickly make the calculations required to reduce all state workers' pay to the federal minimum $6.55 per hour.</blockquote>

            <p>What a difference an election victory makes.</p>

<p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, at an Ohio campaign rally in October for Sen. John McCain, said then-candidate Barack Obama "needs to do something about those skinny legs. We're going to make him do some squats. And then we're going to go and give him some biceps curls to beef up those scrawny little arms." </p>

<p>But the governor had nothing but love for President Obama on Thursday in Los Angeles, according to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20247.html">Politico</a>.</p>

<p>"But I think he's so smart," he said. "He's so clear with his thinking and he's so well informed and has been dealing with policy in all this and is also very philosophic it's almost like. I think he's just like - I think it's beautiful."</p>

<p>The goverrnor, if you'll recall, also compared Obama's policies in October to European Socialism. Schwarzenegger said at the time, "Sen. Obama says he wants to pursue the same spread-the-wealth ideas that Europe had decades ago."</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger's tune was a bit different Thursday.</p>

<p>"The economic stimulus package that President Obama has put together, California is benefiting tremendously from that, $85 billion, $35 billion alone just in tax benefits," Schwarzenegger said in his introduction at a Los Angeles town hall meeting, according to a transcript. "And then there is the economic stimulus package which injects $51 billion into California's economy. That's right, $51 billion into California' economy -- $18.6 billion for health and human services, $9 billion for education, $72 billion for infrastructure, $5.3 billion for labor, $3.4 billion for energy and climate change, $1.2 billion for housing and the list goes on and on and on."</p>

<p>"I tell you, it is the greatest package," Schwarzenegger added. "I am so happy that we are getting those kinds of benefits from the federal government and from President Obama."</p>

<p><em>ADDENDUM (5:05 p.m.):</em> Schwarzenegger communications director Matt David noted that after the election, Schwarzenegger began working with Obama and was only one of two Republican governors to support the economic stimulus package.</p>

<em>from Andrew McIntosh:</em></p>

<p>Secretary of State Debra Bowen said today the state will get $3.25 million after she settled her department's lawsuit against Election Systems & Software Inc., the electronic voting machine manufacturer.</p>

<p>After paying for attorneys' fees, the remaining $2.93 million the state will get from Election Systems & Software will be used to improve and strengthen the integrity of California's electoral system, Bowen said.</p>

<p>"Californians have the right to know the systems they use for voting have met the legal standards for security, accuracy, reliability, and accessibility," Bowen said in a statement announcing the settlement.</p>

<p>Bowen filed a lawsuit against the voting machine manufacturer in November 2007, amid allegations that the company had sold 972 AutoMARK Model A200 ballot-marking machines to several counties that contained hardware changes that had were not authorized by the Secretary of State, as required by law.</p>

<p>Five California counties bought the modified Model A200 machines believing they were buying voting equipment exactly like the AutoMARK Model A100 machines the Secretary of State had actually tested and approved. The counties included: San Francisco (558 machines), Solano (160), Marin (130), Merced (104), and Colusa (20).</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>California is a baby factory that produced 566,352 infants in 2007, far more than any other state, according to a new statistical report from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>California's bumper crop of babies reflected not only the state's highest-in-the-nation population but its markedly above-average birth and fertility rates, the compilation released this week reveals.</p>

<p>The state's birthrate, 15.56 per 1,000 population, is more than a full baby above the national average of 14.3 and among the higher rates among the states, which ranged from 20.6 in Utah to 10.5 in Vermont. Only Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Nevada and Texas had higher birthrates than California.</p>

<p>California's fertility rate, 72.5 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, was also higher than the national average of 69.5 and, like its birthrate, among the highest state-by-state rankings, which Utah also topped at 94.4.</p>

<p>California's births work out to more than one baby a minute and are the largest single factor in the state's continued population growth, which is expected to be close to 5 million during this decade.</p>

<p>The state's births dipped sharply in the late 1990s, due largely to a severe recession earlier in the decade, but have returned to the 550,000-plus per year level since then. The late 1990s dip created a lull in school enrollment during this decade, even a slight dip, but the renewed high level of births since then indicate that school enrollment will begin to climb soon.</p>

<p>The full statistical report on births is available <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_12.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a><br />

<p>Stark "in 2007 and 2008 saved a total of $3,853 in state and Anne Arundel County taxes on a Maryland waterfront home that he claims as his primary residence, according to Maryland tax disclosures," Bloomberg reports.</p>

<blockquote>Homeowners in Maryland qualify for the tax credit for residences they use "for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver's license, and filing income tax returns," according to the Maryland Assessment Procedures Manual. 

<p>Stark, 77, confirmed in a telephone interview last week that he and his wife, Deborah, are registered to vote in California's 13th congressional district using the address of her parents in San Lorenzo, about 25 miles southeast of San Francisco. Stark also said both he and his wife have California driver's licenses</blockquote></p>

            <p>Rep. Ellen Tauscher will resign her seat in Congress to take a post in the Obama administration as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security.</p>

<p>Tauscher represents portions of the East Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area and is in her seventh term in the House.</p>

<p>"Keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists, making sure other countries do not obtain them and, one day, I hope, ridding the world of these terrible weapons, has become my passion and, I hope, my life's work," the Alamo Democrat said in a statement.</p>

<p>Tauscher noted that "the confirmation process for senior posts in government is fraught with uncertainty and can take weeks, if not months."</p>

<p>There are lots of potential Democratic candidates for the Contra Costa-area seat, including former Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla of Pittsburg, Assemblyman Tom Torlakson of Antioch, Sen. Mark DeSaulnier of Concord, freshman Assemblywoman Joan Buchanan of Alamo, and local officials. Democrats hold a strong registration advantage in the district.</p>

            <p>Voter registration in California continued to increase even after last November's presidential election and now stands at 17.3 million, Secretary of State Debra Bowen reported today.</p>

<p>Although registration climbed by about 30,000 from last November, the percentage of potentially eligible voters that has registered declined fractionally to 74.4 percent. Both registration and penetration of the eligible pool have, however, increased dramatically in the last two years. The corresponding snapshot in 2007 had registration at 15.7 million, 68.9 percent of eligible.</p>

<p>Democrats have widened their lead over Republicans a bit since last November, but have seen a gain of two percentage points since 2007 to 44.52 percent while the GOP has dropped from 31.4 percent two years ago to 31.14 percent now.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Fred Aguiar is back in his old post.</p>

<p>After Rosario Marin <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1676667.html">resigned</a> this month as secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency under fire for giving paid speeches, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger reappointed Aguiar to the position, his office announced Wednesday.</p>

<p>Aguiar was the governor's first State and Consumer Services secretary from 2003 to 2005. He then served as Schwarzenegger's cabinet secretary before being appointed in 2007 to the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board -- a panel with six-figure positions oft-maligned for being filled with former legislators. Aguiar also was a former lawmaker, serving six years in the Assembly from 1992 to 1998.</p>

<p>Aguiar will vacate his Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board position, according to Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Rachel Cameron.</p>

<p>The governor also appointed Scott Reid, a Schwarzenegger aide who was Aguiar's chief of staff in the Assembly and at the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, as State and Consumer Services undersecretary.</p>

<p>Aguiar, a Republican, will earn $175,000 a year. Reid, registered decline-to-state, will earn $132,196.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Ex-Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata testified Tuesday at the case of the man accused of carjacking him more than a year ago.</p>

<p>Josh Richman of the <a href="http://www.ibabuzz.com/politics/2009/03/17/don-peratas-day-in-court/">Oakland Tribune</a> spoke with the ex-senator after the court appearance.</p>

<blockquote>Another item in the fire-engine red Dodge Charger's back seat was "a small baseball bat that I use when I walk precincts," Perata testified.

<p><br />
Outside the courtroom, I asked him about that.</p>

<p>"Dogs," he explained, relating how he'd been chased out of many a front yard by the resident pooches. The souvenir-sized bats are a perfect defense, he said: "You slide 'em right up your sleeve."</p>

<p>Quite the, ahem, enforcer. But was he representing his East Bay district well by carrying a San Francisco Giants item?</p>

<p>"Well, y'know, they gave 'em away," he said somewhat sheepishly. "I never got one from the A's."</blockquote></p>

            <p>President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> is making a Southern California swing beginning today with a stop in Orange County.</p>

<p>He'll host town hall-style events both today (in OC) and Thursday (in Los Angeles). He'll also be appearing on NBC's <strong>"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."</strong></p>

<p><strong>No sitting president has ever before appeared on a late-night show</strong>, NBC has said.</p>

<p>Obama is taking to the relatively friendly questions of late-night to try to sell his <strong>$3.6-trillion budget plan</strong>. Of course, he could always announce that he is running for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3128015.stm" target="_blank">governor of California</a>.</p>

<p>Back in Sacramento, the state's top finance officials will consider <strong>undoing the funding freeze that has delayed more than 5,000 bond-funded infrastructure projects</strong>.</p>

<p>"California will be back in the bond market after a nine-month absence, and <strong>we're confident investors will greet us warmly,"</strong> said Treasurer <strong>Bill Lockyer</strong>, who chairs the obscure Pooled Money Investment Board. </p>

<p>Lockyer is recommending that the panel <strong>release up to $500 million in project financing</strong>.</p>

<p>Under the dome, there are lots of committee hearings. In the Senate Rules Committee, there is a confirmation hearing for <strong>Margaret Fortune</strong>, the former education adviser to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. She has been appointed as a trustee to the California State University system.</p>

<p>Around Sacramento, it's always fundraising season, with <strong>nine lawmakers hosting check-collecting affairs today</strong>.</p>

<p><em>BIRTHDAY</em>: Assemblyman <strong>Alberto Torrico</strong>, D-Newark, turns 40 today. <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020356.html" target="_blank">But don't you dare consider giving him a gift</a>.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Just under half of California's high school graduates continue their educations in public colleges and universities, but research by the California Postsecondary Education Commission shows wide variances in college attendance by geography, gender and ethnicity.</p>

<p>One of many charts created by the CPEC, for instance, breaks down post-high school education by state Senate district, showing that 66.1 percent of graduates in Sen. Tom Harmon's district - a wealthy slice of Orange County coastline - attended community college, a state university or the University of California after graduation in 2007. But the proportion dropped to a low of 26.4 percent in Sen. Dean Florez's largely agricultural and heavily Latino district in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley.</p>

<p>An even wider geographic range was found in the county-by-county breakdown, from a low of 11.7 percent in Shasta County to a high of 83.4 percent in adjacent Siskiyou County.</p>

<p>The CPEC statistical compilation found that ethnically, Asian American high school graduates were most likely to attend public colleges, 68.8 percent, while whites, at 42.4 percent, were least likely. African American and Latino graduates both were slightly more likely than whites to seek college educations.</p>

<p>Statewide, community colleges handled nearly 62 percent of the college-bound graduates in 2007, with the University of California accounting for about 15 percent and the state university system the remaining 23 percent. But there are huge disparities, especially ethnic ones, in those data as well.</p>

<p>A quarter of the state's Asian American high school graduates attend the University of California, but just 4 percent of African American and Latino graduates go on to UC, and just 5.7 percent of whites.</p>

<p>There's also a big gender gap. While 8 percent of female high school graduates are admitted to UC, just 6.4 percent of males attend UC - even though overall college attendance is virtually equal in the two genders.</p>

<p>The complete set of college attendance data sheets is available <a href="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/StudentData/CollegeGoingRates.asp" target="_blank">here.</a> <br />

            <p>State Treasurer Bill Lockyer and state Finance Director Mike Genest will meet at 10 a.m. at the Capitol for a public hearing on whether California is getting enough of the right kind of federal stimulus money to trigger  fewer spending cuts and a smaller income tax increase.</p>

<p>No decision is expected. </p>

<p>But outside, social service advocates will be making their case that failing to pull the trigger would mean unacceptable cuts to In-home Supportive Services, Medi-Cal option benefits, SSI-SSP and CalWORKS grants beginning July 1.</p>

<p>They'll be joined on the lawn by hundreds of pro-union activists, who will be there to declare California "an employee free choice state." Labor wants federal legislation  that would let unions organize by collecting signed membership cards instead of holding secret ballot elections.<br />
 <br />
The International Longshore and Warehouse Union will join in the Capitol rally to protest workplace conditions at Sacramento's Blue Diamond Growers.</p>

<p>Today is also the day that former 1970s radical Sara Jane Olson is due for release from a Chowchilla prison.</p>

<p>Minnesota doesn't want her - but California state Sen. Jeff Denham, R-Merced, does. </p>

<p>He penned this in a letter Monday to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger: "If she is paroled, I agree with the Los Angeles and Minnesota police leagues that she should serve her parole under restrictions (perhaps including GPS) in California and urge you, Governor, to prevent her from returning to her double life in Minnesota." </p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Former eBay boss Meg Whitman is keeping the California political press corps at bay as she runs for governor - even ducking out of one press conference as reporters tried to question her about the state budget - but she and her handlers are courting national press attention.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/Fortune%20Cover%203.30.09.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/Fortune%20Cover%203.30.09.html','popup','width=600,height=788,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/assets_c/2009/03/Fortune Cover 3.30.09-thumb-250x328.jpg" width="250" height="328" alt="Fortune Cover 3.30.09.jpg" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span></p>

<p>The latest manifestation of that anywhere-but-California media strategy is a lengthy cover story in Fortune magazine -- replete with several picture of her with her horse. While the article is titled "Can Meg Whitman Save California?" the horse is brown, not white. </p>

<p>Here's one passage:</p>

<p>Flash back to day one of Meg Whitman 2.0. We are sitting in her tidy living room in Atherton, Calif., on a rain-soaked morning in late February, at 24 hours and counting before she is due to give the first campaign speech of her life. Whitman, who left eBay a year ago after a decade in the job, seems unfazed by the trouble all around her. Besides waking up this morning to find a giant oak tree toppled in her front yard (it missed her white picket fence by inches), there's the daunting reality of California. "We have the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the country. We're 48th of 50 states in K-12 education," Whitman says, spewing stats and sound bites as if she's rehearsing for her first political debate. "Other states are stealing California's jobs," she says. "California is failing. I refuse to sit by and watch it happen."</p>

<p>The Fortune writer, Patricia Sellers, also characterizes one Whitman comment as an "obvious dig at Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, to wit: "Being CEO of the state is not a popularity contest. In the real world, business leaders cut expenses until the company is healthy again." Sellers also writes that Whitman didn't flinch when asked whether she'd spend as much as $50 million from her billionaire's fortune to win the office next year.</p>

<p>One other sign of Whitman's newly found media presence: Her first name is the answer to the first clue in a recent Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Even with recent and proposed increases in fees, attending California's community colleges and four-year universities is still a bargain, the California Postsecondary Education Commission finds in a new comparison with other states.</p>

<p>The state's community college fees, now $600 a year for a full 15-unit load, are, by far, the lowest in the nation - just two-thirds of what students in second-lowest New Mexico pay. The national average is $2,700, 4 1/2 times the California level.</p>

<p>Undergraduate fees at the California State University System are also the lowest among the state-operated four-year university systems that California uses for salary comparison purposes. CSUS fees are $3,849 this year, slightly over half of the $7,516 average among the 15 other state systems, which are topped by the $10,800 at New Jersey's Rutgers University.</p>

<p>University of California fees, $8,027 this year, are not quite the lowest among the four state universities used for comparison. The University at Buffalo (New York) holds that place, but UC is second lowest and nearly $2,000 under the $9,905 average. The University of Illinois, $12,106, is the highest among the comparable universities.</p>

<p>The complete CPEC report, which includes graduate fees and historic comparisons both in current and constant dollars, is available <a href="http://www.cpec.ca.gov/Agendas/Agenda0903/DR_fees.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a> <br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Californians don't have the nation's lowest bills for homeowners' insurance, but they're also far below the highest, according to a report by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p>

<p>The survey, covering data through 2006, found that California families paid an average of $937 for a year's homeowners' insurance, an increase of 4.7 percent from the previous year, slightly below the 5.2 percent national average.</p>

<p>Average premiums ranged from a high of $1,409 in Texas to a low of $490 in Wisconsin that year. A few states, including Wisconsin, reported declines in their average rates. At the other end of the scale, Floridians were jolted by a 28 percent increase, bringing their average bills to $1,386, just behind Texas.</p>

<p>The survey results were reported in Smart's California Insurance Report, a newsletter.</p>

<em>from Rob Hotakainen:</em></p>

<p>California is still golden on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>The Golden State ranks first in clout, according to an analysis released today by Roll Call, a Washington-based publication.</p>

<p>"The Golden State boasts the Speaker and two Senate committee chairmen (and they're all women), as well as the chairmen of the House Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce, Foreign Affairs and Veterans' Affairs committees," the newspaper said. "Lots and lots of people in the state. And lots and lots of Democrats in the House delegation -- more Democrats, in fact, than any other state has Members. The Big Enchilada. 'Nuff said."</p>

<p>New York and Texas ranked second and third, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>So you thought the budget fight was over</strong>.</p>

<p>And then the nonpartisan <strong>Legislative Analyst's Office</strong> estimated Friday that California is <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020638.html" target="_blank">already $8 billion behind the eight ball</a> in the 2009-10 budget.</p>

<p>"The state's economic and revenue outlook continues to deteriorate," the LAO report said.</p>

<p>Assembly Speaker <strong>Karen Bass</strong> said the revenue drop was "not surprising."</p>

<p>Don't look for Republicans to step back to the tax-raising table, said Assembly GOP leader <strong>Mike Villines</strong>: "When we passed the budget in February, <strong>we made it clear that any further budget action we may need to take in the coming months must be done solely through savings to government programs</strong>."</p>

<p>Senate President Pro Tem <strong>Darrell Steinberg</strong>, in a prepared statement, took a swipe at GOP gubernatorial candidates <strong>Meg Whitman</strong> and <strong>Steve Poizner</strong>, who have been critical of the taxes in the budget deal.</p>

<p>"I am extending an invitation to both Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner to meet with us," Steinberg said. "They've both said that as Governor they could close our budget gap without raising taxes. Well now, that's what we need to do and <strong>we need their list of cuts and savings</strong>."</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The legislative leaders who labored for weeks trying to find a way to patch the $40 billion budget gap closed last month were quick to react today to LAO projections of a new $8 billion hole.</p>

<p>Senate leader Darrell Steinberg even extended a special invitation to GOP gubernatorial hopefuls Steve Poizner and Meg Whitman, who have been critical of the February budget deal.</p>

<p><strong>Assembly Speaker Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles</strong></p>

<p>"Given the nation's continuing economic problems since we passed the budget, it is not surprising to see the state's revenue projections continue to fall. We must keep a careful watch on revenues during these volatile times, and all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, must be prepared to continue to make tough decisions should the May Budget Revision also show significant declines in revenue. We also have to keep in our minds the potential that if the ballot measures fail on May 19th, the budget problem grows by another $6 billion."</p>

<p><strong>Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines, R-Clovis</strong></p>

<p>"Republicans take very seriously the warning issued today by California's Legislative Analyst that our economy continues to deteriorate and revenues continue to decline. We understood when we passed the budget in February that our state's fiscal crisis was not over, and that the Legislature may be called upon to make further spending reductions in the months ahead.</p>

<p>"We agree with the Analyst that further tax increases should not be on the table. When we passed the budget in February, we made it clear that any further budget action we may need to take in the coming months must be done solely through savings to government programs.</p>

<p>"The Analyst's report echoes what Republicans have been saying all along -- that economic recovery and job creation must continue to be an important priority for the Legislature in the coming months. We will continue working to try and pass economic recovery measures that will create more jobs for those out of work and inspire more economy activity in our state."</p>

<p><strong>Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento</strong></p>

<p>"We will solve the challenge outlined this morning by the Legislative Analyst with the same intensity that we solved the $42 billion problem in February."</p>

<p>"It should come as no surprise that the Nation's economic downturn continues to severely impact California's budget - retail sales continue to decline and unemployment continues to rise and American families lost $5.1 TRILLION in the last 3 months of 2008."</p>

<p>"Like thousands of businesses and millions of families, state government has less money to spend."</p>

<p>"But moms and dads will continue to get their kids off to school. Sick people will need an emergency room. There will be fires to put out. Criminals to prosecute. And elderly people to care for."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, the action we took in February makes what we face more manageable."</p>

<p>"For months those who have lobbied us have told us what not to cut, what not to tax, what not to do."</p>

<p>"That time is past. We have entered the post-press release period of our budget crisis."</p>

<p>"I am extending an invitation to both Meg Whitman and Steve Poizner to meet with us. They've both said that as Governor they could close our budget gap without raising taxes. Well now, that's what we need to do and we need their list of cuts and savings."</p>

<p>"We invite any and all people and stakeholders who are skeptical of the magnitude of the challenges we face to step forward with their ideas."</p>

<p>"Senate Budget Subcommittees are already meeting to craft additional changes to the budget. In addition, the Senate Budget Committee will convene in the coming weeks to hear from the Legislative Analyst on this report and what steps we can take to fix this problem."</p>

<p>"We will solve the problem."</p>

<p><strong>Senate Republican Leader Dennis Hollingsworth, R-Murrieta</strong></p>

<p>"The fact that the LAO is projecting a $6 Billion deficit for the 2009-2010 Budget is not a surprise. I said early on this budget was not going to fully solve the problem. We had anticipated the budget shortfall would be around $10 billion, and it still could reach that number."</p>

<p>"Now we need to focus on re-evaluating some of the solutions previously discussed that include helping the private sector create jobs and stimulate the economy. We also need to use any federal stimulus money California receives efficiently and effectively and look at streamlining government by reducing spending. We can't go back to the taxpayer's again to ask them to fix the problem, especially after hitting them with a $1,000 price tag just three weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Clearly, more work is needed and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Assembly and Senate to achieve that task."<br />

            <p>When it comes to protecting children's interests, there are no 100 percenters in the California Legislature, the San Diego-based Children's Advocacy Institute says.</p>

<p>The institute chose 25 votes in the 2008 legislative session dealing with education, poverty, health care, safety, child care, child protection and other child-related issues and compiled legislators' votes.</p>

<p>The lowest-ranked legislator was Assemblywoman Sharon Runner, R-Lancaster, with a score of just 20 percent, while the lowest ranked senator was Democrat Ed Vincent, D-Inglewood, at 24 percent. Both Runner and Vincent, however, suffered from severe health problems during the year and their low scores reflected absences when many of the votes were taken.</p>

<p>No legislator voted as the institute preferred 100 percent of the time but 10 senators and 31 Assembly members, all Democrats, achieved 96 percent scores. The full scorecard is available <a href="http://www.caichildlaw.org/Misc/2008ReportCard.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a> <br />

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Exports, which had been one of the brightest sectors of the California economy in recent years, plunged by more than 20 percent in January, a new analysis of federal data by the University of California's Sacramento center reveals.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce statistics were released today, and the UC analysis says California's merchandise export trade in January totaled $8.661 billion, 21.6 percent below the $11.048 billion recorded in January 2008. The state's manufactured exports were down 21. percent, while non-manufactured exports (chiefly agricultural goods) were off 28.6 percent.</p>

<p>"These distressing January numbers describe an accelerating turn for the worse in California's export trade,"  Jock O'Connell, the UC Center's international trade and economics adviser, said. "January's fall-off was much more severe than the declines recorded in the prior two months."</p>

<p>January was the third consecutive month in which state exports fell below the level reported for the same months in the preceding year. November's exports were 6.3  percent lower than November 2007, while December's exports were down 13.7 percent from the preceding December.</p>

<p>At the Port of Oakland, the number of loaded containers outbound in January was down 15.2 percent. Even more pronounced declines in outbound movements of loaded containers were seen at the Ports of Los Angeles ( down 29.4 percent) and Long Beach (off 27.3 percent).</p>

<p>At Los Angeles International Airport export tonnage was down in January by 21.3 percent, while San Francisco International Airport saw a 28.1 percent reduction.</p>

<p>California accounted for 11.1 percent of the nation's merchandise export trade in January, much below its all-time peak share of 17.0 percent recorded in December 2000.</p>

<p>"Preliminary figures for February hardly depict an improving situation," O'Connell warned.</p>

<p>"It could be several months before we begin seeing signs of substantial improvement in California's export trade, and that is not good news for California workers."</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The Legislature's budget analyst, Mac Taylor, declared today that the immense package of spending cuts, new taxes and loans aimed at closing the state's $40 billion budget deficit will fall short by $8 billion because the state's economy is continuing to falter.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the state's economic and revenue outlook continues to deteriorate," the Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) said in a review of the package, which covered the remainder of this fiscal year and all of the next.</p>

<p>"Even in the few weeks since the budget was signed, there have been a series of negative developments. Our updated revenue forecast projects that revenues will fall short of the assumptions in the budget package by $8 billion. Consequently, the Legislature and governor will need to adopt billions of dollars in additional solutions in the coming months to bring the 2009-10 budget back into balance."</p>

<p>Taylor had some more bad news for the state's political leaders. Because so many of the "solutions" adopted last month are temporary, "without corrective actions, the state's huge operating deficits will reappear in future years - growing from $12.6 billion in 2010-11 to $26 billion in 2013-14."</p>

<p>Taylor said that to close the newly discovered $8 billion gap, the state should maximize its use of federal "stimulus" funds and "continue developing programmatic solutions, especially those his office has been recommending in recent months but the Legislature and the governor shunned in adopting their package last month.</p>

<p>The LAO report will renew the Capitol's partisan and ideological squabbling over spending cuts and new taxes and fuel calls on the left for even more tax increases and those on the right for deeper spending cuts.

            <p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/us/politics/13waters.html?_r=1" target="_blank">New York Times</a> featured a story on Thursday saying that California Rep. Maxine Waters arranged a meeting for a bank, where her husband was a director, where the bank asked for federal aid:</p>

<blockquote>Top federal regulators say they were taken aback when they learned that a California congresswoman who helped set up a meeting with bankers last year had family financial ties to a bank whose chief executive asked them for up to $50 million in special bailout funds.<br>
<br>
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, requested the September meeting on behalf of executives at OneUnited, one of the nation's largest black-owned banks. Ms. Waters's husband, Sidney Williams, had served on the bank's board until early last year and has owned at least $250,000 of its stock. </blockquote>

<p>A couple of unhappy Treasury aides are quoted, including:</p>

<blockquote>"It is upsetting to me," said Jeb Mason, the deputy assistant secretary for business affairs at Treasury during the Bush administration, whose office helped set up the meeting. "This is something that was potentially politically explosive and embarrassing to the administration. They should have at least let us know."</blockquote>

            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/BobbyShriver.jpg"><img alt="BobbyShriver.jpg" src="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/BobbyShriver-thumb-400x264.jpg" width="400" height="264" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a></span><em>Exclusive to The Bee and Capitol Alert:</em> <strong>Bobby Shriver</strong>, the nephew of President <strong>John F. Kennedy</strong> and brother of California first lady <strong>Maria Shriver</strong>, is <strong>mulling a run for California attorney general</strong> next year, according to his political adviser.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old Democrat is a member of what's perhaps America's most famous political dynasty, the Kennedy clan. </p>

<p>His father, <strong>Sargent Shriver</strong>, was the 1972 Democratic candidate for vice president. Of his other uncles, <strong>Robert Kennedy</strong> was U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator, and <strong>Ted Kennedy</strong> has served in the U.S. Senate for years.</p>

<p>"There's been a wide variety of people who have come to him and who he has used as a<strong> sounding board to talk about the job of attorney general and the role it takes, the profile it has in terms of moving California forward</strong>," said <strong>Harvey Englander</strong>, a Democratic political strategist who managed both of Shriver's successful runs for Santa Monica City Council, in an interview.</p>

<p>Englander, who described himself as "very close" to Shriver, <strong>called the role of California's top cop "a very powerful position" and one that is "closest to fitting his profile." </strong></p>

<p>Shriver, a graduate of <strong>Yale Law School</strong>, would certainly bring star power to the attorney general's race.</p>

<p>Despite his family's long political history, Shriver is a relative political newcomer. He was first elected to the <strong>Santa Monica City Council</strong> in 2004 and reelected last year, finishing atop the field each time.</p>

<p>Englander said he and Shriver have spoken about <strong>the scrutiny Shriver's cousin, Caroline Kennedy, recently endured as she floated her name as a candidate for U.S. Senate</strong> in New York to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>Kennedy ultimately withdrew from consideration.</p>

<p><strong>"One of the big differences between his cousin and he is Bobby has been in the public arena for a good part of his adult life,"</strong> Englander said, noting that Shriver has co-founded two organizations, Product (Red) and DATA, to fight disease in Africa with U2's Bono.</p>

<p>If he does in fact jump in, Shriver -- and his national profile -- would likely have a been impact on what the rest of the AG field looks like.</p>

<p>San Francisco District Attorney <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> is in the race, as is Los Angeles City Attorney <strong>Rocky Delgadillo</strong>, who ran and lost to <strong>Jerry Brown</strong> in 2006. Three Assembly Democrats, <strong>Alberto Torrico</strong>, <strong>Ted Lieu</strong> and <strong>Pedro Nava</strong>, are also running.</p>

<p><em>OFF TO ASPEN</em>: Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> is off to Aspen today after his big speech Thursday on the budget ballot measures.</p>

<p>He'll be fundraising for those measures.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The Riverside <a href="http://blogs.pe.com/ballotwatch/2009/03/adams-recall-committee-keeps-i.html" target="_blank">Press-Enterprise</a>'s Jim Miller found an interesting twist to the early formation of the committee to recall Republican Anthony Adams of Hesperia, who voted for the budget package last month:</p>

<blockquote>The main name on the Committee to Recall Adams is David Bauer of Sacramento. Last year, Bauer was campaign treasurer for Rep. Tom McClintock during the hard-fought race in Northern California's 4th Congressional District.

<p><br />
Bauer also is the chief financial officer of JohnsonClark Associates, a statewide campaign-consulting firm based in Sacramento.</p>

<p>That would be the same JohnsonClark that has overseen Adams' past campaigns and would be leading the fight against any recall effort.</p>

<p>That should make for some interesting conversations around the water cooler.</blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Related</strong>: GOP Assemblyman Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley, says Adams and his GOP colleagues who voted for the budget should be dealt with "in the normal election cycle" in an op-ed on <a href="http://www.redcounty.com/sanbernardino/2009/03/there-was-no-republican-conspi/" target="_blank">Red County</a>.</p>

<p>"Republicans who supported the tax increases made their choices as individuals.  While I disagree with their decisions, I will defend their right to act as both a representative and a leader of their Assembly districts.  Constituents can judge their performance in the normal election cycle," Cook wrote.</p>

<blockquote>A top executive of the nonprofit that manages California's prison healthcare system was fired today and another resigned under pressure.<br>
<br>
Receiver J. Clark Kelso, appointed by the court to run the California Prison Health Care Receivership Corp., eliminated the job of Chief Counsel John Hagar, who had been with the organization since its inception. The organization's CEO for medical services, Dr. Terry Hill, was fired, and the job of Hagar's assistant, Stephen Weston, was eliminated.
<br><br>
Kelso also described management changes that he projected gradually would reduce prison health costs by up to a $500 million annually. He described the moves as "housecleaning that you do every spring." </blockquote>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The League of Women Voters, which was part of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's coalition to pass redistricting reform last year, parted company with the governor today, declaring opposition to four of the six budget-related ballot measures he wants approved at the May 19 special election.</p>

<p>"We oppose these measures because they are not the solution to our long-term financial crisis, with the continuing structural deficit in the state budget and flawed budget process," said Janis R. Hirohama, LWV president.</p>

<p> "We make this decision with regret. We would support real reform to make the state budget process more accountable and give the Legislature and governor effective tools to advance state priorities. However, these hurriedly drafted propositions, produced at the end of a flawed process that kept both the public and most legislators in the dark, will only make our fiscal situation worse."</p>

<p>Proposition 1A, the linchpin of the package and Schwarzenegger's pet proposal to place a rolling limit on state spending,drew particular scorn from the organization, which said, "Proposition 1A is touted by its proponents as the way to bring stability to the budget process. But what it will really do is tie the hands of the Legislature and governor as they face changing needs for state and local government services. It will keep them from taking into account the state's changing demographics and growth in the actual cost of important services like health care." </p>

<p>"Although some claim there is an urgency to pass Proposition 1A to resolve our state's budget problems, we disagree," said Hirohama. "Most of its provisions will not take effect for two years--two years that we should spend hammering out real solutions to our budget and fiscal challenges."</p>

<p>The league opposed Propositions 1A, 1C, 1D and 1E. The latter three would authorizing borrowing against state lottery proceeds and tap money originally approved by voters for children's programs and mental health. The organization did not oppose Proposition 1B, a measure to provide additional school financing in later years, but its enactment depends on passage of Proposition 1A. And it did not take a stand on Proposition 1F, which would deny salary increases to elected officials during budget deficits.</p>

<p>The league's announcement came just as Schwarzenegger was touting the package before the prestigious Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON --- President Barack Obama is promising unprecedented accountability in watching how states spend the $787 billion approved by Congress last month, the largest spending bill in the nation's history.</p>

<p> Toward that end, the White House has created a Web site called<a href="http:// www.recovery.gov" target="_blank"> www.recovery.gov</a>, and states are busy following suit.</p>

<p> So far, California is one of 19 states that has yet to create its Web site, but all states are expected to be up and running in short order.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger hits the campaign trail today for the package of budget ballot measures calling them critical to ensuring the state never returns to such a budgetary "Valley of Doom."</p>

<p>"Our state capital is a town that feeds on dysfunction. The special interests, left and right, need the process to be dysfunctional. That is how they control Sacramento. That is how they prevent change," Schwarzenegger will say, according to excerpts provided by his campaign operation. "And the very interests, the far left and the far right, that prefer dysfunction over change have already launched a campaign to confuse people and defeat the reform. But this time they are not going to succeed."</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger will focus, in particular, on Proposition 1A, the spending cap ballot measure that would also extend the length of the tax hikes in the state, noting "California has not had a rainy day fund since Earl Warren was governor."</p>

<p>"Never again do we want to find ourselves wandering around in another $42 billion Valley of Doom," he will say in a noon speech to the Commonwealth Club.</p>

<p>He even offers an apology for raising taxes.</p>

<p>"Governor Pat Brown had to raise taxes. Governor Ronald Reagan had to raise taxes. So did George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson and Gray Davis," he will say. "And Arnold Schwarzenegger--even though I try to make myself feel better by noting they're temporary and expire in four years."</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>One of the intriguing early machinations of the still-very-far-way 2010 GOP primary is how Steve Poizner, Meg Whitman and Tom Campbell will come down on the budget package headed to the ballot in May.</p>

<p>Yes, the insurance commissioner and former eBay chief have already blasted the package.</p>

<p>But both are wealthy and could curry favor with the GOP base by actually spending some of their millions against it.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Campbell, a former budget director for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, officially endorsed the package, offering full-throated support for the spending cap measure, which would extend the tax increases by two years.</p>

<p>"Proposition 1A is the intervention taxpayers need to stop this out of control spending and get our budget onto a stable path for the long-term," Campbell said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jennifer Nelson reported on the <a href="http://www.flashreport.org/blog.php?postID=2009031101250698" target="_blank">FlashReport</a> that Poizner told a GOP group he would take a "major role" in opposing the measure:</p>

<blockquote>When asked if he would take a major role in leading an opposition effort, he said yes, that he plans to work with anti-tax groups to rally opposition to the measure. </blockquote>

<p>Whether that includes digging into his wallet remains unclear. Poizner has spent his funds in ballot campaigns before, most notably opposing Proposition 93, which would have extended term limits for incumbent state lawmakers. That issue was another winner among the GOP base.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger has seemed to take the early jockeying in stride. <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/capitalnotes/2009/03/02/squabbles-or-a-full-scale-battle/" target="_blank">When asked</a> about Whitman's critical comments of the plan last month, the governor retorted, "She's a smart woman. I'm sure she will look at this and see it's a terrific package."</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> will make his case for the budget package on the May 19 ballot in an appearance at the <strong>Commonwealth Club</strong> in San Francisco.</p>

<p>The noon address will be broadcast live on the radio -- <strong>89.3 FM</strong> in Sacramento and <strong>88.5 FM</strong> in the Bay Area. Or online at <a href="http://www.kqed.org" target="_blank">kqed.org</a>.</p>

<p><em>ART TORRES AND STEM CELL COMMISH:</em> California stem-cell agency has on its agenda today the selection of the next vice-chairman.</p>

<p>That could be <strong>Art Torres</strong>, the chair of the California Democratic Party. Or it could be Schwarzenegger's pick, current board member <strong>Duane Roth</strong>.</p>

<p>Or both?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://californiastemcellreport.blogspot.com/2009/03/dual-vice-chairs-coming-up-for-cirm-one.html" target="_blank">California Stem Cell Report</a> noted an agenda item that could potentially change the agency's bylaws to have two vice chairs.</p>

<p><em>FIELD POLL:</em> <strong>Only 41 percent of Californians say the state is "one of the best places to live,"</strong> according to a new Field Poll.</p>

<p>Still, residents don't much like the idea of dividing up the Golden State, with <strong>71 percent</strong> disapproving of a north-south divide and <strong>82 percent</strong> opposing an east-west split.</p>

<p>Find the statistical tabulations <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/806/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, opinions vary by region. A full <strong>61 percent</strong> of Bay Area denizens cited the state among the best places to lives.</p>

<p>Only <strong>37 percent</strong> of Los Angeles residents said that. That's what we Bay Area baseball fans like to call <strong>the Dodger blues</strong>...</p>

<p><em>HUGS ALL AROUND:</em> OK, so former Assembly Speaker <strong>Bob Hertzberg</strong> isn't likely to be tapped as the next leader of the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

<p>But the Los Angeles Democrat is the replacing <strong>Leon Panetta</strong> as <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020586.html" target="_blank">co-chair of California Forward</a>, the governmental reform group.</p>

<p><EM>BIRTHDAYS:</em> Assemblyman <strong>Charles Calderon</strong>, D-Whittier, turns 59 today. </p>

<p>Former state Sen. <strong>Mike Machado</strong>, the Linden Democrat who was <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/018838.html" target="_blank">recently appointed</a> to the board of directors of the State Compensation Insurance Fund, turns 61.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Former Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg is becoming the Democratic co-chair of California Forward, a bipartisan, foundation-underwritten group that promotes state government reform.</p>

<p>Hertzberg succeeds Leon Panetta, a former congressman and White House chief of staff whom President Barack Obama named head of the Central Intelligence Agency. And he joins the Republican co-chair of California Forward, Thomas McKernan.</p>

<p>The organization supported Proposition 11, the 2008 ballot measure that shifted legislative redistricting, and is studying other proposals for reform, including an open primary system.</p>

<p>Another civic organization, the Bay Area Council, meanwhile, is promoting a constitutional convention as a more aggressive step toward reform, and the two groups have developed something of a rivalry for media attention and organizational support.</p>

<p>"I have watched California Forward's work for the past year and am honored to work alongside public, business and regional leaders who care deeply about California's future and have devoted their lives to helping its government institutions keep pace with a changing state," Hertzberg said in a statement. </p>

<p>Hertzberg is a partner at Mayer Brown LLP and is chairman and co-founder of G24 Innovations based in Cardiff, Wales, which manufactures a lightweight and flexible solar cell. He represented a San Fernando Valley district in the Assembly from 1996 to 2002 and was speaker during his final term. He also chaired the transition team for Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.</p>

        <div class="asset-name entry-title title"><a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/03/latest-incarnat.html">Universal health care bill returns</a></div>
     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>   California state Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, said Wednesday his new universal health-care bill - the "latest incarnation" in a long struggle - already has 43 co-sponsors in both houses of the Legislature.</p>

<p>He talked up the bill, Senate Bill 810, at a press conference where he was surrounded by a supportive cast of legislators, nurses and doctors. Leno's bill is similar a bill approved by the Legislature in 2008 and vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because of objections it smacked of socialism.</p>

<p>"Well, socialization is not an ugly word in Washington, D.C. these days," Leno cracked, comparing health insurance to the banking system. The private sector gets all the profits, he said, while the people and government get to shoulder all the risk and coverage for those the industry rejects.</p>

<p>Leno said bill supporters will be working the public to gain more support for a single-payer system, which he said could save billions by cutting out insurance "middlemen" who waste money. The United States, he said, pays much more per capita compared to other industrialized countries and still ranks poorly by comparison for access to care.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger might veto the bill again, Leno said, but the public mood has shifted and the people want a solution. "It's no news to anybody that we are in the midst of a health care crisis in this country." he said.</p>

<p>Lisa Page, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Schwarzenegger vetoed last year's universal health care bill because the Legislative Analyst's Office estimated it would cost the state $210 billion in its first full year of implementation and cause annual shortfalls of $42 billion. Page said the governor, however, is still committed to "cost effective ways" to solve health insurance problems.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Back when Tony Strickland ran for state controller in 2006 he was criticized for funneling campaign cash to his wife.</p>

<p>Now that he's in the state Senate, Strickland wants to ban that very practice.</p>

<p>Timm Herdt of the <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/mar/10/strickland-legislation-would-outlaw-consultant/">Ventura County Star</a> has the story.</p>

<blockquote>"I exercised bad judgment," Strickland now says of his decision to contract for campaign services with his wife's company. "I didn't think anything of it at the time because Audra did that as a profession."

<p><br />
Audra Strickland, now a member of the Assembly, had previously worked for former Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle's fundraising operation.</p>

<p>Sen. Strickland says he now understands why some would question the ethics of the practice, which has been used by several other elected officials.</p>

<p>"Constituents are demanding that we have transparency in government," he said.</blockquote></p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Don't expect Attorney General Jerry Brown to actually admit that he's running for governor anytime soon.</p>

<p>"People are worried about the economy, they're looking to Washington, they're worried about the budget. Most of them are not going to dial up on the campaign yet," he told the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=14&entry_id=36779">San Francisco Chronicle</a> in an interview.</p>

<p>Brown sounded off on all manner of topics -- from his 1980 presidential campaign slogan to his would-be wealthy GOP opponents.</p>

<p>Asked if the Republicans posed a threat, he said, "You bet they do. You spend <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/019934.html">$150 million</a>, you spend $2 million a week attacking the Democrats ... attacking their character," he said. "That's very serious stuff.'' </p>

<p>As for not campaigning yet, he said:</p>

<blockquote>"Maybe others have to reach out, they have to introduce themselves," he said. And some are encouraged by "paid political consultants who colonize the political process."</blockquote>

            <p>One of the topics of discussion at last week's Supreme Court hearing on <strong>Proposition 8</strong> was <strong>whether the government should be in the marriage business</strong>.</p>

<p>Well, on Tuesday two people filed an initiative to get the state of California out of the business altogether.</p>

<p>The initiative, filed by <strong>Kaelan Housewright</strong> and <strong>Ali Shams</strong>, replaces the term "marriage" with "domestic partnership" throughout California statutes, while preserving the rights of marriage.</p>

<p>Shams and Housewright are students, 22 and 21 respectively, the AP reported.</p>

<p>The next step would be to gather roughly <strong>700,000 valid signatures</strong> to place the measure on the ballot -- a tall task.</p>

<p>But hey, they have a Facebook group...</p>

<p><em>PASSING THE HEALTHCARE BATON</em>: Sen. <strong>Mark Leno</strong> will officially unveil legislation to provide universal healthcare in California through a single-payer system today.</p>

<p>Termed-out Sen. <strong>Sheila Kuehl</strong> had carried that mantle for several years -- even reaching Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong>'s desk once, where it was vetoed.</p>

<p>On hand for the Capitol press conference will be a handful of current (<strong>Mariko Yamada</strong>, <strong>Loni Hancock</strong>, <strong>Dean Florez</strong>, <strong>Wes Chesbro</strong>), former (<strong>Virginia Strom Martin</strong>) and wanna-be lawmakers (<strong>Bill Durston</strong>), along with the California Nurses Association and other advocates.</p>

<p><em>ECONOMIC WOES:</em> Virtually every California (96 percent) says we've hit bad economic times, according to the latest Field Poll.</p>

<p>That's the highest proportion in the three decades-plus the poll has asked that question.</p>

<p>And people don't see things improving, with <strong>41 percent</strong> saying the climate will be worse in the next 12 months and only <strong>29 percent</strong> seeing improvement.</p>

            <p><em>By Andrew McIntosh</em></p>

<p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger promised Tuesday that his administration will fix problems at the Employment Development Department so that jobless Californians don't get expensive recorded messages when they're trying to apply for unemployment insurance.</p>

<p>"It is enough of a tragedy when you lose your job," Schwarzenegger told reporters on the lawn outside the Capitol. "The last thing you need is a recording when you call and you don't get the services provided."</p>

<p>"We are going to try and work on that and try to eliminate the problem," he told a Bee reporter who asked whether taxpayers should pay Verizon five cents every time a jobless Californian calls for help and, instead of reaching a live operator or hearing a busy signal, hears the same recording over and over again.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p><em>From Jim Sanders</em></p>

<p></p>

<p>Today marks the 50th anniversary of an unsuccessful Tibetan uprising against China - and a showdown is brewing in the Assembly over a resolution to mark that event.</p>

<p>Assemblyman Sam Blakeslee, R-San Luis Obispo, has proposed the resolution, ACR 6, to recognize Tibet Awareness Day and the Dalai Lama, who was forced into exile by the failed uprising.</p>

<p>China contends that Tibet always has been a part of its territory. It took control of the region in 1951 and tension has existed ever since. Violence erupted in Tibet over anti-Chinese protests surrounding last year's March 10 anniversary.</p>

<p>Blakeslee's measure, similar to a resolution adopted routinely by the Assembly last year, is opposed by Chinese government officials who regard it as an insult.</p>

<p>"It would send the wrong signal that the separatist forces have the support of the state Assembly," said Yunliang Zhou, spokesman for the Chinese consulate in San Francisco.</p>

<p>"It would great harm the Chinese people's feelings, and also harm the friendly cooperation between China and the United States, especially the state of California," Zhou said.</p>

<p>Blakeslee said that Assembly Democratic leaders pulled his resolution from the Assembly's consent calendar this week but promised that it will be heard Monday.</p>

<p>ACR 6 says the Dalai Lama has used his leadership to "promote democracy, freedom and peace for the Tibetan people."</p>

<p>The measure also notes that the United Nations General Assembly passed resolutions "calling for the cessation of practices that deprive the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms, including the right to self-determination."</p>

<p>Blakeslee's resolution concludes by recognizing March 10 as a day to "educate Californians about the teachings of the Dalai Lama and his efforts to preserve the Tibetan culture."</p>

<p>The San Luis Obispo Republican already has accepted amendments to delete a sentence opposing "China's efforts to oppress the Tibetan people through use of fear, terror and political education."</p>

<p>Blakeslee said he was "startled and perplexed" when ACR 6 was pulled from the consent calendar after Chinese officials fought it.</p>

<p>"This is a Legislature which historically is proud to stand up for oppressed people," Blakeslee said. "I can't imagine why we would lose courage at this critical point with such a vulnerable population."</p>

<p>Though ACR 6 has no effect of law, Zhou characterized it as symbolically significant and said its recognition of the March 10, 1959 uprising honors a "very sensitive day."</p>

<p>"We cannot accept it," he said. "We're strongly opposed."</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The nonpartisan <strong>Legislative Analyst's Office</strong> will release a new report today on the impact of the federal stimulus plan on California.</p>

<p>The LAO's take is significant as the state's <strong>fiscal gurus</strong> weigh whether there is enough money to avoid pulling <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020362.html">the trigger</a> on <strong>higher taxes and deeper cuts</strong> (totalling $2.7 billion).</p>

<p>The complex budget deal enacted last month said the state had to receive at least $10 billion from the feds to avert the taxes and cuts.</p>

<p>Last week, the Schwarzenegger administration estimated there <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/1673623.html">would not be enough stimulus funds</a>, but state Treasurer <strong>Bill Lockyer</strong> has not taken a public position.</p>

<p>On Monday, the left-leaning <strong>California Budget Project</strong> said there was <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1684750.html">more than enough federal money.</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Assembly Budget Committee</strong> will meet today to discuss the issue, with Legisaltive Analyst <strong>Mac Taylor</strong> set to testify.</p>

<p>The specific taxes and cuts at stake: An additional <strong>0.125 percent on every income tax</strong> bracket in 2009, equal to $1.8 billion in higher taxes. Also on the chopping block would be <strong>adult dental services and podiatry</strong>, <strong>$100 million for higher education</strong>, reductions in monthly <strong>SSI/SSP grants</strong> for low-income disabled and elderly residents by <strong>2.3 percent</strong> and <strong>monthly grants for welfare families by 4 percent</strong>.</p>

<p><em>POLLING GAY MARRIAGE:</em> Here's a shocker: <strong>Californians remain divided over gay marriage</strong>.</p>

<p>The latest Field Poll shows voters <strong>split on same-sex marriage 48 percent to 47 percent</strong>. Voters narrowly voted to ban such marriages via <strong>Proposition 8</strong> last fall.</p>

<p>The interesting tidbits are in the <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/806">exclusive statistical tabulations</a>.</p>

<p>The base of support for gay marriage remains in the Bay Area (<strong>64 percent</strong>), young people (<strong>55 percent among those 18-39</strong>) and non-religious types (<strong>81 percent</strong>).</p>

<p>Opposition is centered among the elderly (<strong>34 percent support among those 65 or older</strong>), men (<strong>43 percent</strong>) and the Central Valley (<strong>36 percent</strong>).</p>

<p>Here's their quick summary:<br />

	<li>Freshman Assemblyman Jerry Hill has a lucrative pool cleaning business.  </li><br />

	<li>Then-Speaker Fabian Nunez gave Assemblyman Hector De La Torre a $78.89 "Patagonia Vest" the day after De La Torre complained, according to The Sacramento Bee, that "[De La Torre] was ousted as chairman of the powerful Rules Committee for challenging Assembly Speaker Fabian Núñez's 'golden handshake' offer to employees." </li><br />
	<li>Assemblyman Martin Garrick doesn't shy away from the "legislative receptions." </li><br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Last week's election was mixed bag of results for local measures to increase taxes, according to the California Taxpayers Association.</p>

<p>All but three of the 10 local tax measures were approved by voters, Cal-Tax reported. Voters in two affuent school districts, Orinda Union (Contra Costa County) and Bolinas-Stinson (Marin County), approved parcel taxes, but those in Gravenstein Union in Sonoma County rejected a parcel tax.</p>

<p>The two other defeats were in the Fresno suburb of Clovis, whose voters rejected a one-cent increase in the local sales tax, and in Beverly Hills, where a revision of local taxes on business that would have increased revenues was nixed.</p>

<p>Utility tax increases were approved in Bellflower, Carson, Gardena and Redondo Beach, and hotel taxes were boosted in La Mirada.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-retreat9-2009mar09,0,826656.story?track=rss">Los Angeles Times</a> reports that a trio of interest groups paid for a Democratic retreat amid the budget talks late last year.</p>

<p>Speaking of the budget, radio hosts John and Ken helped organize a Tax Revolt rally in Fullerton over the weekend to protest the new taxes in the plan.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/came-brought-ken-2328216-others-john">OC Register</a> calls it a crowd of 8,000-plus:</p>

<blockquote>Some wore buttons. One man brought a bloody effigy head of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and waved it from the end of a pike, while the crowd joined their hosts in a chant of "Repeal, recall, revolt."

<p>Many in the crowd held up cameras to capture a big hit as VHS  cassettes, DVDs, laser discs, an action hero lunchbox and other memorabilia from the governor's Hollywood career, were piled up and smashed with a sledgehammer</blockquote></p>

<p>The event stirred up anger and energy for the would-be recalls of the GOP lawmakers that supported last month's budget compromise.</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.flashreport.org/blog0a.php?postID=2009030702451178&post_offsetP=0&authID=2006111814384800">FlashReport</a>, meanwhile, former Sen. Jim Battin argued against pursuing the recalls, calling them "an effort that would eat up Republican money and ultimately cost us seats in 2010."</p>

<blockquote>Suddenly, instead of focusing on winning seats, the talk is all about recalling Republican members of the legislature.  So, instead of using the precious little money we have on fighting Democrats - we now are going to use it on fighting each other.  Which means less money to pick up and defend seats in the future.  Believe me, the Democrats are laughing at us - we're eating our own.  (again)</blockquote>

<p>Qualifying any recall begins with gathering signatures, a process facilitated in California by allowing for paid signature gatherers.</p>

<p>Joe Mathews of the <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/blog/blockbuster-democracy/2009/arizona-house-committee-votes-bar-signature-pay-10509">New American Foundation</a> notes that in Arizona a bill is moving through the Legislature to ban that practice.</p>

<p>"This is potentially a big deal," Mathews writes. "Per-signature pay is the American standard for petition circulators."</p>

<p>Speaking of new ideas, here's one from a new blog covering California politics: What California needs is more lawmakers.</p>

<p>That's the word from <a href="http://calbluedog.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/no-bull-more-legislators-needed-in-sacramento/">California Blue Dog</a>, a Web site by former Gray Davis aide Stevan Allen.</p>

<blockquote>Our state possesses the dubious distinction of being the least democratic and representative of any state in the union. So when a free-thinking voice in the Capitol is bullied, stifled or silenced by either Republican or Democratic party leadership, Californians living in those districts are disenfranchised in massive numbers. Each Senator represents about 847,000 Californians; each Assemblymember 423,500 constituents.</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-electionmaps8-2009mar08,0,5363749.story?track=rss">Los Angeles Times</a> looked at election returns from last week's mayoral races and sees that incumbent Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa won just about everywhere -- but the San Fernando Valley.</p>

<p>(The other two were <strong>balancing the budget</strong> and <strong>modernizing the state's tax codes</strong>.)</p>

<p>Today, Bass and a host of others will hold a press conference to highlight a new report that says California <strong>"could realize at least a 2-1 benefit-to-cost ratio in extending foster care for youth to age 21."</strong></p>

<p>Among the attendees will be: Senate leader <strong>Darrell Steinberg</strong>, California Supreme Court Justice <strong>Carlos Moreno</strong>, former Senate leader <strong>John Burton</strong> and a bipartisan cast of current legislators.</p>

<p>Bass will press for AB 12, legislation she's co-authoring with Assemblyman <strong>Jim Beall</strong>, to extend the foster care age and try to <strong>capture more federal funds</strong>.</p>

<p><em>STEINBERG TO BACK TOBACCO TAX</em>: Senate Democrats will target a familiar foil again in 2009, as Steinberg and Sen. <strong>Alex Padilla</strong> will roll out tobacco legislation package this Tuesday centered on a <strong>$1.50 cigarette tax hike</strong>.</p>

<p>In the Assembly, Democrat Tom Torlakson is <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/018329.html">already pushing to raise the tobacco tax</a>.</p>

<p>Both tax bills would require a two-thirds vote -- and therefore Republican support.</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p><br />
Apparently embarrassed by Los Angeles Times' reports this week about his appointees' use of travel money and receipt of speaking fees, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a memo Friday requiring more public access to travel and income reports. The best part: top officials will have to post their annual statements of economic interest and monthly expense reports online. Here's the memo: </p>

<p><em>DATE:           March 6, 2009</p>

<p>TO:                 All Governor's Office Staff<br />
                        All Agency Secretaries<br />
                        All Department Directors</p>

<p>FROM:           ANDREA LYNN HOCH<br />
                        Legal Affairs Secretary<br />
                        Office of the Governor</p>

<p>RE:                 New Form 700s and Travel Expense Claim Forms <br />
                       Review and Posting Policy Form </p>

<p><strong>700s Review</strong></p>

<p>Effective today, the following review process will be implemented for Form 700s:</p>

<p>The General Counsel or Chief Counsel of each Agency or Department shall be responsible for reviewing all Form 700s filed by individuals, including the Secretary or Director, working in his or her Agency or Department.  <br />
 <br />
The Governor's Legal Affairs Secretary shall be responsible for reviewing: (1) all Form 700s filed by individuals working in the Governor's Office; and (2) all Form 700s filed by Agency Secretaries.</p>

<p><strong>Form 700s Posting</strong></p>

<p>To provide increased transparency and accountability, the Governor's Office will post Form 700s on the Governor's web site.  The Governor's Office will begin posting Form 700s for Calendar Year 2008 (which are due by April 1, 2009), and then post prior year Form 700s beginning with Calendar Year 2007 through Calendar Year 2004.  </p>

<p>The following Form 700s will be posted on the Governor's web site:</p>

<p>Governor's Office Senior Staff and Deputies <br />
Agency Secretaries<br />
Agency Undersecretaries<br />
Department Directors</p>

<p><strong>Travel Expense Claim Forms</strong></p>

<p>To provide increased transparency and accountability, the Governor's Office, all Agency Secretaries, all Agency Undersecretaries and all Department Directors will begin posting the following travel expense claim forms (TEC) on their respective web sites:</p>

Agency Secretary and Agency Undersecretary TECs shall be posted on the Agency's web site.<br />
Department Director TECs shall be posted on the Department's web site.<br />
 <br />
This TEC posting policy shall apply to all TECs submitted on or after today's date and the first posting shall occur no later than March 31, 2009.</em></p>

            <p>The Bee reports today that the ballot descriptions for <strong>Proposition 1A and 1E</strong> <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1676652.html">have been changed</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger appointee <strong>Rosario Marin</strong> <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1676667.html">resigned Thursday from her post as secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency</a> after accepting tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees in defiance of administration policy and possibly state law.</p>

<p>Today is the <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1676881.html">last Furlough Friday</a>.</p>

<p>The owner of the <strong>Golden Gate Fields</strong> horseracing track has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/06/BUNT16A2SV.DTL">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>Ed Mendel, at <a href="http://calpensions.com/2009/03/06/463/">Calpension.com</a>, looks into the pension giant's effort "to help state and local governments borrow more cheaply" -- and how it could cost the pension fund.</p>

<p><strong>"In exchange for only a couple million dollars you are taking on a heckuva a tail risk,"</strong> Michael Schlachter of Wilshire Consulting told the CalPERS investment committee last week.</p>

<p>California environmental officials finally got their EPA hearing on the state's proposed limits on auto emissions. From the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/environment/la-na-emissions6-2009mar06,0,2898775.story?track=rss">LAT</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Automakers and dealers raised concerns over several points of California's plan and said they would welcome a nationwide standard for emission limits. California officials said they wouldn't accept any national standard that fell short of their state's.

<p><br />
Listening to the arguments was the Obama administration, which has expressed strong interest in crafting a national emission standard that satisfies the recession-rocked domestic auto industry and California.</blockquote></p>

<p>At the state level, the Air Resource Board " issued a far-reaching proposal to slash carbon emissions from transportation fuels, setting the stage for a national battle over how to reduce the damage to the global climate from gasoline and diesel combustion," according to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-fuel6-2009mar06,0,2382098.story?track=rss">LAT</a>.<br />

And after last month's budget vote, there's <strong>a lot of itching going around the Capitol</strong>.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Senate President Pro Tem <strong>Darrell Steinberg</strong> <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020379.html" target="_blank">rearranged offices in the upper house</a> (made necessary by Sen. <strong>Dennis Hollingsworth</strong>'s selection as GOP leader). Not surprisingly, Sen. <strong>Dave Cogdill</strong>, the ousted Republican chief who voted for the budget, didn't end up in the smallest of digs.</p>

<p>That honor went to Sen. <strong>George Runner</strong>, an outspoken member of the anti-tax faction of the caucus.</p>

<p>Cogdill also was handed <strong>the chairmanship of a select committee on surplus property</strong> this week.</p>

<p>We're hearing that more changes (likely favorable to other GOP voters <strong>Abel Maldonado</strong> and <strong>Roy Ashburn</strong>) could be in the pipeline...</p>

<p>Over at the Assembly, Republican <strong>Anthony Adams</strong> stuck his neck out to vote for the budget. Now, conservative forces are plotting a recall attempt.</p>

<p>So next month Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> will thank the Hesperia Republican by attending a district fundraiser tentatively scheduled for early April.</p>

<p>There's punishment, too, as meted out by Assembly Speaker <strong>Karen Bass</strong> when she <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020304.html" target="_blank">stripped three then-committee chairmen of their posts</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/ArnoldClassic.jpg"><img alt="ArnoldClassic.jpg" src="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/ArnoldClassic-thumb-150x108.jpg" width="150" height="108" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span><em>THE ARNOLD CLASSIC</em>: Schwarzenegger will be spending the weekend in Columbus Ohio, attending the annual <strong>Arnold Sports Festival</strong> bodybuilding competition, as he does every year.</p>

<p>The last time Schwarzenegger was in Ohio, he headlined a rally for presidential candidate <strong>John McCain</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>"He needs to do something about those skinny legs,"</strong> Schwarzenegger teased now-President <strong>Barack Obama</strong>. "We're going to make him do some squats. And then we're going to give him some biceps to beef up those scrawny arms. If only we could do something about putting some meat on his ideas."</p>

<p><em>NO, WE'RE NOT KIDDING:</em> The McGeorge School of Law holds a <strong>conference on governmental ethics</strong>. Former San Francisco Mayor and Assembly Speaker <strong>Willie Brown will be the luncheon speaker</strong>.</p>

<p><em>BOXER ON TOP</em>: Voters aren't particularly inclined to reelect U.S. Sen. <strong>Barbara Boxer</strong>, with <strong>42 percent in favor and 43 percent opposed</strong>, according to the Field Poll.</p>

<p>But California's junior senator does much better when lined up against her potential challengers.</p>

<p><strong>Boxer</strong>: 54 percent<br />
<strong>Schwarzenegger</strong>: 30 percent</p>

<p>and </p>

<p><strong>Boxer</strong>: 55 percent<br />
<strong>Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina</strong>: 25 percent</p>

<p>In the hypothetical GOP primary, Schwarzenegger finishes first, but by a small margin:</p>

<p><strong>Schwarzenegger</strong>: 31 percent<br />
<strong>Fiorina</strong>: 24 percent<br />
<strong>Assemblyman Chuck Devore</strong>: 9 percent<br />
<strong>Undecided:</strong> 36 percent</p>

<p>Without the governor, Fiorina leads DeVore 31 percent to 19 percent -- but with half the electorate undecided.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg has shuffled office space assignments in the upper house. And - surprise - Sen. Dave Cogdill, who provided a key vote for last month's budget at the cost of his post as GOP leader, won't suffer too badly, at least when it comes to square footage.</p>

<p>New Senate Republican leader Dennis Hollingsworth is moving into Cogdill's former  space on the third floor, the spacious office reserved for the GOP leader.</p>

<p>But Steinberg has decided to assign Cogdill to the office of Sen. George Runner, a leader of the GOP hardliners against taxes. Runner, R-Lancaster, is being moved to the smaller office of Sen. Rod Wright, D-Inglewood, who moves to Hollingsworth's old office.</p>

<p>Runner's soon-to-be former digs have long been the home of the Senate Republican Caucus Chair, the post Runner holds. But Steinberg is breaking that tradition to land Cogdill in the spacious office. The move has rubbed some Senate Republicans the wrong way.</p>

<p>Runner spoke with Capitol Alert early Thursday, but had no comment as he said the move was not yet official. Later, he did update his Facebook status. "George Runner (is) packing up his Capitol office and being moved to smaller space because he stood up for taxpayers and voted no to higher taxes, that's the way it works in Sac."</p>

<p>Steinberg's office is downplaying the changes.</p>

<p>"It is just a routine operational procedure borne out of having to move the former minority leader out of the minority leader's office," said Jim Evans, a Steinberg spokesman.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Steinberg also created a new select committee on reviewing the state's surplus property, long a GOP priority, and named Cogdill as chair. </p>

<p>"This committee will play a pivotal role in helping the state continue to find ways to save money during these tough economic times," the Modesto lawmaker said in a prepared statement.</p>

<p>Cogdill is also expected to retain all the staff he had as leader, including Ron Rogers, who earns $165,000 per year.</p>

<p>More house changes beneficial to the three GOP votes for the budget package (the others are Sen. Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria and Sen. Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield) could follow. Potential changes in the make-up of the Senate Rules Committee, another plum GOP assignment, are being discussed, but no shifts have been announced.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>One of the complexities buried deep in the budget proposal adopted by the Legislature last month is a trigger that will reduce the volume of cuts and tax increases in the plan.</p>

<p>In short, the state must receive $10 billion in federal aid to avoid those cuts and taxes.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/1673623.html?mi_rss=Top%20Stories">today's Bee</a>, Kevin Yamamura reports that "Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Department of Finance estimated Wednesday that California will not receive enough federal stimulus money" by about $2 billion.</p>

<p>But Finance has only one of the two deciding votes; the other is granted to the state treasurer.</p>

<p>As Yamamura reports, "It's not clear what happens if the two men can't agree."</p>

<p>Here's how State Treasurer Bill Lockyer's Web site describes the trigger:</p>

<blockquote>The State budget enacted Feb. 20, 2009 requires the State Treasurer and Director of Finance to determine by April 1, 2009 whether California will receive at least $10 billion from the $789 billion federal economic stimulus package, called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and, possibly, other federal legislation. To qualify, the federal funds have to be "made available" to California by June 30, 2010, and must offset expenditures that would otherwise be made from the State General Fund. If State funds must be spent to access the federal funds, those State expenditures, at least in some cases, will be subtracted from the dollars counted toward the $10 billion benchmark. </blockquote>

<p>Lockyer is soliciting public feedback <a href="http://treasurer.ca.gov/10B_BudgetTrigger/index.asp">here</a>. A hearing is set for March 17 with a final decision due by April 1.</p>

<p>On the Republican side, <strong>Meg Whitman</strong>, former eBay CEO, has the early lead with <strong>21 percent</strong> support, with 54 percent undecided.</p>

<p>Those numbers are for <strong>the hypothetical match-ups 460 days from now</strong>. Capitol Alert has the <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/806" target="_blank">exclusive statistical tabulations</a>.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>               Days after launching his campaign for attorney general, Assembly Majority Leader Alberto Torrico is proposing a crackdown on the Legislature he will be termed out of next year.</p>

<p>	The Newark Democrat announced legislation Wednesday that would require lawmakers to pass a state budget by June 15 each year or permanently lose their $173-per-day payment for living expenses until they send the governor a spending plan.</p>

<p>	The measure, Assembly Bill 1411, also would bar campaign fundraising after June 15 until a state budget is passed.</p>

<p>               "These are steps to change the public's perception of the Capitol's culture," Torrico said in a written statement. "The reforms I am proposing will give Californians a stronger sense that we are looking out for the public's interest."</p>

<p>               In a separate bill, Assembly Bill 1412, Torrico proposes to bar lobbyists, lobbying firms or lobbyist employers from giving any gift to state lawmakers.</p>

<p>              Currently lobbyists and lobbying firms can give each lawmaker a gift costing up to $10 per month, while lobbyist employers can spend more, up to $420 per year for a legislator's gift, according to Roman Porter, executive director of the Fair Political Practices Commission.<br />

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>              Assemblyman Ted Gaines has a ready quip when asked how he tore ligaments and fractured his left leg.</p>

<p>             "I went into the governor's office to talk about tax cuts," he says.</p>

<p>	Truth is, the Roseville Republican fell during a charity giant slalom race for Northern California Rotary Clubs last Friday at Tahoe's Alpine Meadows Ski Resort.</p>

<p>	Gaines, a veteran skier, said he finished his first run Friday without incident but that the tips of his skis hit a rut near the bottom of his second run.</p>

<p>              "I think I was going too fast," Gaines said.  "I was skiing like a 20-year-old - but with a 50-year-old body."</p>

<p>             Gaines is waiting to hear whether surgery is needed to repair partial tears to his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and to his medial collateral ligament (MCL). Meanwhile, he is wearing a heavy brace and has crutches.</p>

<p>	Despite his injuries, Gaines reported for work Monday at the Capitol.</p>

<p>	The two-term assemblyman did not finish the slalom race, but his Auburn Rotary Club team did - and finished 13th out of about three dozen teams competing, Gaines said.</p>

            <p>University of California health researchers have found a statistical connection between the proximity of fast food restaurants to obesity among California's ninth-graders and pregnant women -- but have not established a causal relationship.</p>

<p>Results of the detailed study by UC-Berkeley economists were released today, adding fuel to a burgeoning debate over whether the proliferation of fast-food outlets contributes to the nation's obesity problem.</p>

<p>"These findings add new evidence to the debate on the impact of fast-food on obesity," the research report concludes. "First, we believe we have uncovered credible evidence that the availability of fast food has an effect on the obesity rate of teens and on weight gain in pregnant women. Second, we show that the effects of proximity are quite different for students (who are constrained to stay close to schools during the school day) than for mothers, who presumably are more mobile."</p>

<p>The study found that ninth-graders were 5.2 percent more likely to be obese if their schools were within a tenth of a mile of a fast-food restaurant, but the statistical correlation faded at longer distances. A similar correlation was found for pregnant women living near fast-food outlets. The statistical connections, however, were markedly higher for Latinos and African Americans than for whites, and the researchers added that the study "leaves several questions unanswered."</p>

<p>"The overall quantitative contribution of the expansion of the fast-food industry to the increase in obesity rate remains unclear," was the report's bottom line. "Relatively few schools are located within .1 mile of a fast food restaurant, so the impact identified by our paper applies to a relatively small population. And, while large numbers of pregnant women live within half a mile of a fast food restaurant, the majority does not.</p>

<p>"We cannot speculate about the generalizability of our research to other samples. It is possible that adolescents and pregnant women are uniquely vulnerable to the temptations of fast food. In addition, our research cannot distinguish between a rational price-based explanation of the findings and a behavioral self-control-based explanation. Finally, since fast food is ubiquitous in America, we cannot study the impact of fast-food entry in a society where fast food is scarce."</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>For anyone interested in the ins and outs of local government in California, the basic guide is what's known as the "Quick List," a compilation of laws, Web sites and other information about cities and counties. An updated version has just been completed.</p>

<p>The Quick List is compiled by staff members of the Senate Local Government Committee under its longtime chief consultant, Peter Detwiler. It covers everything from "A" -- AB8, the law that divvies up property taxes among local governments and schools -- to "Z," everything you wanted to know about land zoning.</p>

<p>Not only is the Quick List comprehensive, but it's freely available <a href="http://sinet2.sen.ca.gov/locgov/TheQuickList2009.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a> <br />

            <p>No surprise here: Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa coasted to reelection on Tuesday, grabbing 55 percent of the vote in the <a href="http://cityclerk.lacity.org/election/Results.htm">latest tally</a> by the county clerk. </p>

<p>His closest challenger, Walter Moore, had 26 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Measure B, a key plank of Villaraigosa's renewable energy platform, was deadlocked as of this morning, but slightly behind:</p>

<p>Yes:<br />
109,183 votes</p>

<p>No:<br />
110,505</p>

<p>An unknown number of provisional and absentee ballots remain,</p>

<p>In the city attorney race, Council Jack Weiss won a five-person race by 10 percentage points. He'll be in a runoff on May 19 with Carmen "Nuch" Trutanich</p>

<p>Councilwoman Wendy Greul coasted into the controller's post, avoiding a runoff with more than 65 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Former Assemblyman Paul Koretz was locked in a tight race to replace Weiss on the Council. Less than 100 votes separated him and David Vehedi in the only open-seat campaign. As the top two vote-getters, they are headed for a May 19 runoff.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The epic California budget battle is over. But for Assembly Speaker Karen Bass, it's time for giving out some rewards and retribution.</p>

<p>Three Assembly Democrats who broke with their caucus by voting against a state spending cap and other budget trailer bills have been stripped of committee chairmanships. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers who supported the party majority have gotten promotions.</p>

<p>Those losing out are Assembly members Sandr&eacute; Swanson of Alameda, Tony Mendoza of Artesia and Warren Furutani of Gardena. All three voted against a key budget compromise to put a state spending cap before voters. Now, following a flurry of new assignments by Bass, all three are former chairs of Assembly committees.</p>

<p>"I think it was clear she was disappointed in my budget votes," said Swanson, who was removed as chairman of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee and replaced by Assemblyman Bill Monning of Carmel.</p>

<p>Bass spokeswoman Shannon Murphy said the committee reassignments announced by the speaker are "an internal caucus matter" and declined to confirm a connection to budget votes.</p>

<p>"Having now had a couple of months to see this (legislative) class in action. Speaker Bass has made some mid-term adjustments to committee assignments and the caucus leadership to ensure the Assembly can do the best job for the people of California," Murphy said.</p>

<p>Furutani, who voted against the spending cap, was replaced as chair of the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee by Assembly Paul Fong of Cupertino, who voted for it.</p>

<p>The same scenario held for Mendoza, who bequeathed his chairmanship of the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee to Assemblywoman Norma Torres of Ponoma. </p>

<p>Swanson, who said he maintains "a very good relationship with the speaker," said he parted with Bass and the Democratic caucus on the spending cap and a pay limit for in-home careworkers. </p>

<p>"I felt that this budget was attempted to be balanced on the backs of working families," Swanson said. "I thought that ran counter to what was right in a recession."</p>

<p>Assemblyman Isadore Hall of Compton, who voted for the spending cap, found himself promoted to assistant speaker pro tempore.</p>

<p>"I don't think there was anything that I've done significantly to merit a reward," said Hall, who formerly served in a lesser leadership role as assistant majority whip. "There was a vacancy, and the speaker was wise enough to ask me to lead. I was very much honored and pleased.</p>

<p>"I just know it's the speaker's perogative to make the changes she feels is necessary."</p>

<p>"The commission intended to keep to its schedule but politics may intervene," he writes.</p>

<p>Don't recall Miller: Conservative radio duo John and Ken are plotting a recall against Assemblyman Jeff Miller because he didn't try to overthrow Mike Villines as GOP leader. They randomly grabbed his name out of a hat.</p>

<p>But former GOP Assemblyman Ray Haynes says <a href="http://www.flashreport.org/blog0a.php?postID=2009030223173928&post_offsetP=0&authID=2006111815095457" target="_blank">on the FlashReport</a> that he is "a real fan" of the radio team, but "I have to disagree on Jeff Miller.  Jeff Miller did the right thing.  He voted against the tax increase.  He fought against it, and to single him out for a recall because he didn't oust Mike Villines is just plain wrong."</p>

<p>Andrew McIntosh reports in <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/1666582.html?mi_rss=Top%20Stories" target="_blank">The Bee</a> on the $900,000 former GOP party chair Duf Sundheim is earning with the new group California Republicans Aligned for Tomorrow, or CRAFT.</p>

It's the first time in two years, according to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-na-california-delegation3-2009mar03,0,5748950.story?track=rss" target="_blank">LAT</a>.</p>

<p>"In a story that has circulated around Capitol Hill for years, California's famously fractured delegation gathered for a rare bipartisan meeting and decided to send for pizza -- only to get into a fight over what toppings to order," the story begins.</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Department of Toxic Substances Control Director Maureen F. Gorsen will resign this month after serving for more than three years, according to a letter she wrote to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Monday.</p>

<p>Gorsen, an environmental law attorney, wrote that "it is time for me to return to private law practice."</p>

<p>Her departure comes as the toxic substances department prepares to establish a science-based process for identifying problem chemicals in consumer products by January 2011, part of a "green chemistry" movement mandated by two bills approved in the Legislature and signed by Schwarzenegger last year.</p>

<p>While signing a bill phasing out phthalates from toys two years ago, the Republican governor indicated that he preferred that the state establish a uniform process for reviewing chemicals rather than legislatively banning individual ones.</p>

<p>"As a committed public servant, Maureen has been instrumental in moving California's environmental goals forward and we thank her for her dedicated service to our state," said Schwarzenegger spokeswoman Rachel Cameron. "She played a key role in developing California's first-in-the-nation green chemistry initiative and streamlining the department's permitting process."</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/Schwarzeneggerssigns.jpg"><img alt="Schwarzeneggerssigns.jpg" src="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/Schwarzeneggerssigns-thumb-250x379.jpg" width="250" height="379" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></a></span>A new Field Poll shows that <strong>California voters are dissatisfied</strong> (<strong>55 percent</strong>) with the state budget passed by the Legislature last month. Those likely to vote in the May 19 budget special election are even more unhappy (<strong>65 percent</strong>).</p>

<p>The plan contains a broad swath of tax hikes and deep spending cuts.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, <strong>who are the 45 percent of the people satisfied with that budget?</strong></p>

<p>The same poll shows <strong>initial support for all six items on that ballot</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, support for <strong>Proposition 1A</strong>, the spending restriction measure which would extend the life of the tax increases, <strong>plunges by 23 percent when voters are told about the tax provision</strong>.</p>

<p>Lawmakers <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/1653962.html">must have accidently left that out</a>.</p>

<p>That's not what the odd-couple of the month -- the conservative <strong>Jon Coupal</strong> of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and the liberal <strong>Anthony Wright</strong> of Health Access -- think. They teamed together Monday to sue to change the ballot summary for the measure.</p>

<p>They even got a letter of support from UC Berkeley professor <strong>George Lakoff</strong>, he of <em>Don't Think of an Elephant</em> fame.</p>

<p>"In each case, <strong>the language prejudices voters towards passage of the proposition and toward the political and economic views of the proponents of the proposition</strong>," Lakoff wrote in a letter accompanying the suit.</p>

<p>Umm, wasn't that the point?</p>

<p>We've posted <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020263.html">each of the propositions' polling numbers </a>. And, as usual, Capitol Alert has the Field Poll's <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/806/">exclusive statistical tabulations</a>. </p>

<p><em>Other poll highlights</em>: <strong>18 percent</strong> of voters think the state is headed in the right direction. The same percentage approves of <strong>the job the state Legislature is doing</strong>. Schwarzenegger's approval held <strong>steady at 38 percent</strong> since last September. The <strong>open-primary ballot measure</strong> on the 2010 ballot gets first-blush support from <strong>58 percent of voters</strong>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it's election time in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>An itsy-bitsy fraction of the city's electorate will head to the polls today</strong>, when Los Angeles Mayor <strong>Antonio Villaraigosa</strong> is expected to waltz into a second term.</p>

<p><strong>Post your guess as to the specific date he announces his bid for governor</strong> (if he does) <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/020264.html">in the comments section</a>. Leave your real name and we'll give you a shout-out if you're right when (and if) the time comes. Or say if you think he won't run.</p>

<p><em>EVENT:</em> Oscar-winner <strong>Sean Penn</strong> will be in San Francisco with Sen. <strong>Mark Leno</strong> and Assemblyman <strong>Tom Ammiano</strong> to press for passage of a bill to create <strong>Harvey Milk Day</strong>, named after the slain SF supervisor Penn played in the film <Em>Milk</em>. Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill last year. </p>

<p><em>BIRTHDAY:</em> Assemblyman <strong>Paul Cook</strong>, R-Yucca Valley, turns 66 today.</p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Two decades ago, it was estimated that as many as a third of California's motorists were driving without insurance, but a series of get-tough laws reduced the rate by more than half to 18 percent, according to a new nationwide survey by the Insurance Research Council.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at 18 percent (in 2007), the IRC still tags California as having the nation's seventh highest rate of uninsured motorists at four-plus percentage points above the national average. New Mexico had the nation's highest rate of uninsured at 29 percent while Massachusetts, at 1 percent, was the lowest.</p>

<p>The IRC believes that the severe national recession will raise the uninsured motorist rate throughout the country from 13.8 in 2007 to 16.1 percent in 2010.</p>

<p>California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner has suggested even tougher laws to crack down on uninsured motorists, but none has been passed in recent years, Smart's California Insurance Report notes in its article on the IRC study.</p>

<p>Focus is returning to California's seemingly perennial struggle to find a solution to its water woes. On Friday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a formal drought proclamation, a move to raise awareness of the state's water shortage.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, Sen. Dave Cogdill, a Modesto Republican, introduced a water bond bill (SB 371) after similar efforts stalled last year. Sen. Dean Florez, the No. 2 Democrat in the house, introduced a counter measure (SB 301).</p>

<p>Even the federal government is getting involved. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack created the Federal Drought Action Team to work with the state last week.</p>

<p>"This is very encouraging news," Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in a statement of the task force. "California is in the grip of one of the worst drought emergencies on record."</p>

<p>Interest groups are mobilizing, as well. The business lobby is already backing Cogdill's plan, saying the state's current water system is "faltering." The <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0301-0350/sb_301_bill_20090225_introduced.html">Florez measure</a> totals $15 billion in bonds, while the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0351-0400/sb_371_bill_20090225_introduced.html">Cogdill measure</a> is worth nearly $10 billion.</p>

<p>"We must pass a comprehensive plan this year that will increase storage, improve conveyance, provide important environmental protections and conserve resources,"  said Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>The battle lines in the water storage fight are well drawn: Agricultural interests (and usually Republicans) favor building more reservoirs, while environmentalists (and usually Democrats) don't. There's also the issue of who should pay, as in whether the costs for new storage should be borne by those who use the water or by the state as a whole.</p>

<p>And, of course, there is the question of whether or not a peripheral canal should be included to divert water from the Delta.</p>

<p>Compounding the urgency of the situation is California's current water shortage, with reservoirs between 35 percent and 45 percent of capacity following what's been a three-year drought.</p>

<p>"Our water crisis underscores the urgent need to update California's water infrastructure," Schwarzenegger said in a statement welcoming Cogdill's water bond proposal.</p>

<p>Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, who chaired the Natural Resources Committee in the Senate last session, has said a water deal is a priority.</p>

<p>"Let's get a water infrastructure bond done," he said in his first speech as leader. "It's ready to be closed."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/article/20090227/NEWS01/902270321">Visalia-Times Delta</a> has reported other water bond plans will surface in the Assembly. But any water deal is widely expected to begin in the upper house, where Cogdill, until recently the GOP leader, has carved out both an expertise and a relationship with the governor. Steinberg is familiar with the issues, both policy-wise and political, as well.</p>

<p>While the recent rainstorms may dampen the public's perception of the severity of the drought, water shortages in the coming months remain likely.</p>

<p>"It's just a drop in the bucket when compared to the epic drought the state is currently facing," said Cogdill in a statement.</p>

<p><em>(Updated: Sen. Lois Wolk, D-Davis, also has introduced a $9.8 billion water bond, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0451-0500/sb_456_bill_20090226_introduced.html">SB 456</a>.)</em></p>

     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Criminal corrections - prisons, jails, parole and probation - have been California's fastest growing public expense in recent years with the state's correctional costs doubling in the last decade to about $10 billion a year.</p>

<p>Even so, a new report by the Pew Center on the States, released today, indicates that California is far from being the toughest state in terms of locking up its residents. Nationwide, Pew says, 1 in 31 adults - about 7.3 million men and women altogether - are either behind bars or under parole or probation supervision for crimes. But in California it's one in 36, slightly below the national average. Even so, that amounts to about 750,000 Californians, with more than a fifth of them in state prison.</p>

<p>Georgia, with one of every 13 adults in the correctional system, has the highest ratio, with Idaho, at one of 18, in second place. At the other end of the scale are New Hampshire, with one of 88 adults, and adjacent Maine at one of 81. Among larger states, Texas and Florida have substantially higher ratios than California while New York is much lower at just one in 53.</p>

<p>In 2008, Pew says, the 34 states "for which data are available" spent about $20 billion on prisons, probation and parole, but for some reason the study omitted California which spends more than half that sum all by itself when probation and parole costs are included.</p>

<p>The report, whose chief purpose is to advocate more community-based corrections programs and less imprisonment, does bolster those who say California's correctional system is extraordinarily expensive. The average cost for the 34 states in the survey was $29,000 per prison inmate per year, while in California, state prison officials tab costs at about $45,000 per year for the 170,000 men and women behind bars, accounting for roughly three-fourths of correctional spending. The rest is spent on hundreds of thousands of parolees.</p>

<p>The full Pew study is available <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/sentencing_and_corrections/PSPP_1in31_report_FINAL_WEB_2-27-09.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a> <br />

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-expenses1-2009mar01,0,5484509,full.story">Los Angeles Times</a> reported over the weekend that several top members of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration charged taxpayers thousands in airfare, hotel and meal costs with little oversight.</p>

<p>From the Times: </p>

<blockquote>John Cruz, the appointments secretary for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, lives hundreds of miles from the state Capitol, where his staff scrutinizes candidates for California's many boards and commissions.

<p><br />
When Cruz works there, he goes by plane. He has charged taxpayers for his flights and for hotel bills of up to $382 a night on regular trips between his Orange County home and Sacramento, records show</p>

<p>Carrie Lopez, director of the Department of Consumer Affairs, charged taxpayers to fly from Sacramento, where she works, to Los Angeles, where she lives, to attend a Justin Timberlake concert with her daughter. She listed the trip on her expense report as a meeting with the energy company that paid for the concert tickets. Lopez also billed the state for meals on days she received those meals for free from corporations, according to state records.</p>

<p>Rosario Marin, head of the State and Consumer Services Agency, blamed a miscommunication for her failure to repay $582 the state spent to fly her to Washington in July to speak at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, an appearance for which she received $1,000. She reimbursed the state for the airfare after The Times inquired about the trip last month.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, as California has slashed services and scrambled to pay bills, top administration officials have made free use of government expense accounts with little oversight and, in some cases, no documentation, The Times has found.<br />
...<br />
(Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron) McLear said after Times inquiries that the governor's new Cabinet secretary, Victoria Bradshaw, would take over the task of reviewing travel expenses.</p>

<p>A minimal number of officials travel extensively, McLear said, adding that despite their travel, the governor's office has cut its budget and staff over the last year.</blockquote></p>

        <div class="asset-name entry-title title"><a href="http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/03/lockyer-budget.html">Lockyer: Budget vote 'antes will only keep going up'</a></div>
     </div>
    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>State Treasurer Bill Lockyer voiced a fear that many Democrats hold privately -- that the high price paid to corral the final GOP vote for the budget could set a poor precedent for future negotiations.</p>

<p>"Frankly, I think this is just the beginning of serious budget holdups in the future," Lockyer, a Democrat and former Senate leader, told Greg Lucas of <a href="http://californiascapitol.com/blog/?p=267">California's Capitol</a>. "If you're willing to rewrite the constitution to get a needed vote, the antes will only keep going up.</p>

<p>That's a reference to deciding Republican vote, Sen. Abel Maldonado, who <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/019774.html">received a constitutional amendment on a future ballot to rewrite the state's elections law</a>.</p>

<p>Lockyer, the state's banker, also spoke about the state's bond rating. California has the lowest such rating in the nation, which he blames, in part, on Wall Street.</p>

<p>"The fact is our rating is the lowest of all the states. It's not fair but it's the rating we've got. I've argued with the rating agencies on that but they claim their ratings are being responsive to investors," he said. "If they're being responsive to investors then they want us to have a bad rating so the investors get a better yield. They're helping rip us off, in effect."</p>

    <div class="asset-content entry-content lingo_region">

        <div class="asset-body">

Arnold Schwarzenegger has landed himself on yet another national magazine cover.</p>

<p>Except this one isn't so flattering: "Girly-Man Ruins State," is how the National Review headlines the piece.</p>

<p>The full story is not available online, but Chris Reed, editorial writer for the San Diego Union-Tribune, <a href="http://weblog.signonsandiego.com/weblogs/afb/archives/031641.html">excerpts parts of the piece</a>.</p>

<p>Key line: "Conservatives were cheap dates and missed the subtle signals that Arnold lacked the fierce spirit of liberty that characterized (President Ronald) Reagan's approach to governance."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the GOP governor is still getting praised by some in the national media. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01sun3.html?_r=1">New York Times</a> held up the governor in a Sunday editorial as someone who "acted in the best interest of his state when he announced that he would accept the same federal stimulus aid for the unemployed that some of his fellow Republicans have threatened to reject."</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Gov. <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong> goes farther afield than usual this week to promote California. </p>

<p>The governor is in <strong>Hannover, Germany,</strong> for what's billed as the world's largest technology trade fair, CeBIT.</p>

<p>Today, he signs both <strong>the city's and the trade fair's official guestbooks</strong>. Those events -- read "photo op" -- are open to the press. So are his <strong>remarks at the opening ceremony</strong> tonight. </p>

<p>What's closed to the press: His meetings scheduled with Lower Saxony Minister President <strong>Christian Wulff</strong> (now that's a long title) and with German Chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel</strong>.</p>

<p>What he's missing in Sacramento: The <strong>California School Employees Association</strong> is holding a save-our-schools budget rally on the north steps of the Capitol. </p>

<p>What he's also missing: A joint informational hearing that the <strong>Assembly Natural Resource</strong> and <strong>Utilities and Commerce</strong> committees are holding on air emission credits and electrical generation.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger won't be rushing back. He'll deliver remarks Tuesday at <strong>a Germany-California summit</strong>.</p>

<p>And he can't leave before he gets his <strong>2009 Transatlantic Partnership Award</strong> at the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany luncheon.</p>

<p>FUNDRAISERS: Assemblyman <strong>Jim Nielsen</strong> will be at the Citizen Hotel's Scandal Bar tonight. Tickets, $1,500. Added bonus: Bee cartoonist <strong>Rex Babin</strong>'s scandalous drawings grace the bar walls.</p>
