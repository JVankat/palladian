Hi all<br>
You will have seen loads of photos of the total solar eclipse already<br>
from the main Chinese observing site NE of Hami. Our group of 15 (with<br>
Explore Worldwide) comprised veterans who were on their 5th eclipse,<br>
and newbies like me whose previous experience of totality was Penzance<br>
in the rain in 1999.<br>
The site chosen by the Chinese authorities was between the stony<br>
deserts of the Mongolia border, and the fabulous Karlik Shan mountain<br>
range, snow-capped at about 16000ft high. This gave the most<br>
stupendous 360 degree view of the sky, augmented by the superb land<br>
scenery. There was a huge amount of room, and few restrictions in<br>
where you could go, so the hundreds of observers were well spread<br>
out.<br>
It was 42 degrees C at first contact a little after 6pm local time,<br>
but there was a pleasant breeze and in the dry desert heat, it was<br>
surprisingly bearable. I don't think the temp fell much below 36 or so<br>
during totality. The slow progress of the lunar limb over the solar<br>
disc was exciting to watch, because of the anticipation of 2 minutes<br>
of totality.<br>
A line of fairly heavy clouds sailed slowly up from the mountains in<br>
the west, and at times threatened to block the event, but it was<br>
destined to be clear for totality, probably not affected one way or<br>
the other by a Chinese mobile missile launcher that loosed a couple of<br>
cloud seeding rockets when the event seemed to be threatened! As for<br>
the Olympics, the Chinese put their best efforts into this show!!<br>
The sun was down to a thin crescent about 10 minutes before totality<br>
when a rather small but obscuring cloud seemed to get stuck over it,<br>
and even appeared to change direction - but this was actually to our<br>
advantage, because there was a big clear area looming up, and about 2<br>
minutes before totality, the sun appeared in the clear, to the<br>
accompaniment of cheers drifting across the vast amphitheatre from the<br>
anticipating crowds.<br>
<br>
 By now, the &quot;metallic&quot; light of the thin crescent sun was casting<br>
sharp shadows, No trees were around to give the well described pinhole<br>
camera effect of multiple crescents on the ground. The anticipation<br>
was fantastic, the light was fading by the second, and across the<br>
desert peaks, the diffuse shadow of the moon could be seen<br>
approaching. All eyes were on the crescent sun though, and quite<br>
suddenly, a fantastic diamond ring heralded totality. It seemed to<br>
hang there for several seconds, and then the dimmer switch was turned,<br>
the sky changed in seconds to a deep midnight blue, with mercury and<br>
venus very clear to the west of the sun. It was a competition for<br>
attention then between the beauty of the silvery solar corona, with<br>
its horizontal solar minimum structure, and the awesome colours around<br>
the horizon. The snow caps of the Karlik Shan in the west were still<br>
sunlit, until about mid totality.<br>
<br>
As expected, my own excitement and emotion in this incredible time<br>
almost prevented me from doing the photography I had so carefully<br>
practiced. About mid way through, though, I suddenly realised that I<br>
DID want to take pictures, and fired off the required bracketed<br>
sequence of 6 exposures which I had allowed myself in order to leave<br>
time for the enjoyment of the event. As I recall, it was during this<br>
sequence that the second diamond ring appeared, if possible even more<br>
beautiful than the first, and of course brought the light back to the<br>
awesome landscape around us. The shadow could still be seen to the<br>
west, and it was a couple of minutes before the sun shone again on the<br>
snows of the Karlik Shan, and the excitement of totality was really<br>
over.<br>
<br>
The time between third and fourth contact, expected to be<br>
anticlimactic, was filled with excited discussion of the event, many<br>
smiles, congratulations, and comparing notes on our personal<br>
reactions. At about 25% eclipse, the sun sank behind a sizeable cloud<br>
bank and the very last stage to 4th contact was missed. It was SO<br>
fortunate that totality was not 45 minutes later! By then, a glorious<br>
evening light, with a halo of crepuscular rays from the sun, was<br>
bathing the area.<br>
<br>
It is hard to imagine a more beautiful setting from which to view an<br>
eclipse. The experience was augmented by the lovely friendliness of<br>
the Uighur villagers of Weizixia who had never had a foreigner before<br>
in their village, and suddenly found about 2000 on their doorstep! The<br>
bonus on both the night before and on the night of eclipse day, was a<br>
most fabulous star-studded desert sky, where you thought you were<br>
seeing a thick cloud band, which turned out to be the Milky Way, and<br>
familiar constellations were all but lost in a vast mass of glorious<br>
stars nromally hidden from our view. Sweeping the Milky Way with<br>
binoculars, and the late view of M31 were memorable highlights.<br>
<br>
In the end, the only equipment I took was my Nikon D80 with 300mm<br>
zoom, a pair of 10x50 binoculars, and home made Baader filters for<br>
both those devices. I didn't spend the time wishing I had taken a<br>
telescope. My pictures have turned out OK for a beginner - even<br>
recorded the prominence that was hardly visible visually during<br>
totality. Very pleasing to come away with something, but I guess it<br>
has been said before - NO photo, however photoshopped, could ever<br>
reproduce the beauty of the entire 360 degree experience of totality.<br>
