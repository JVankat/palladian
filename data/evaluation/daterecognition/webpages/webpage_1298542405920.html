<p>On Sunday, July 11, all roads lead to historic Lindbergh Bay where a number of civic organizations have banded together to celebrate the survival of the ecosystem of the fragile marine environment of the area. </p>

<p>Named after Charles Augustus Lindbergh who landed his Spirit of St. Louis on the estate during his good will tour of 1928, Lindbergh Bay has recently captured the attention of visitors and locals alike. </p>

<p>The Virgin Islands Government has the ability to offer tax benefits to businesses doing business in the Virgin Islands. Under the mirror tax system the VI uses the US Internal Revenue Code and all the US tax forms but the taxes collected are remitted to the Virgin Islands Bureau of Internal Revenue rather than the IRS. An individual who is a bona fide VI resident for the entire tax year files a VI return and pays VI tax on his worldwide income for that year. If the US citizen properly files and reports all his income from all sources on a VI tax Return and pays the VI tax, he is not subject to tax in the US. Special rules apply to determine if a person is a bona fide VI resident and if income is possessions source income. There are various tax benefit programs available to residents and businesses of the <strong><a href="http://www.usvieda.org">Virgin Islands through the Economic Development Program (EDC) </a></strong>and the <strong><a href="http://www.uvirtpark.com">University of the Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park (RTPark)</a></strong>. These programs offer tax credits of up to 90% of the income tax due.<a href="http://www.usvieda.org"></p>

<p>Now is the time of year when sailors from the U.S. and Europe plan their trips to the Caribbean to participate in one or more of the popular island regattas held here every spring. Not all Caribbean regattas are created equal, however. Savvy sailors know that the <strong><a href="www.rolexcupregatta.com">International Rolex Regatta</a></strong>, hosted by St. Thomas Yacht Club and scheduled for Friday, March 26 through Sunday, March 28, 2010, has an offering that goes beyond just beach parties and calypso bands. <img src="http://www.virginislandsthisweek.com/images/events-schedule-regatta.jpg" width="250" height="334" border="0" class="home" alt="Events Schedule Rolex Regatta"/>The International Rolex Regatta guarantees exceptional racing by virtue of its dependable trade winds and, even more important, a professional race management team.</p>

<p>The International Rolex Regatta is the only major Caribbean regatta that is run by a yacht club, so competing sailors can be certain that the organizers know a thing or two about what the "whole package" should be. Absolute proof that this is the case will always be in the eventual entry line-up, and this year anticipated headliners are Jim Mitchell (SUI), returning with his Reichel Pugh 52 Vincitore to defend his 2009 title, and Tom Hill (Puerto Rico), returning to reclaim the past glory of multiple Titan victories with his latest steed, Titan 15, a Reichel Pugh 75.</p>

<p><em>By Andi Bailey </em></p>

<p>These days, the hot new way to travel is not so much defined by the means of the vacation--i.e. the flight, the hotel, the gorgeous destination--but by the end result of a trip. Voluntourism is sweeping the world as the trend for travelers in the know. The idea is simple, and it's catching. Everyone from college students to retired couples is finding a way to lend a hand and spend their vacations helping others in the communities they are visiting.<br />

                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p><strong>August 4, St. Thomas -</strong> The Butterfly Farm and Barefoot Wines are presenting "Barefoot Brunch with the Butterflies" on Sunday, August 30, as a fund raising event for the Humane Society of St. Thomas.  The event will feature professionally guided tours of The Butterfly Farm, as well as a light brunch, champagne cocktails featuring Barefoot Wines, and juices and water.</p>

<p>The fundraiser will begin at 10 a.m. and conclude at 2 p.m.  Tickets are $15 for adults and $5 for children.  Each ticket-holder will receive a tour of The Butterfly Farm, a light brunch, and one cocktail or drink.  Additional drinks will be for sale.  All proceeds will benefit the Humane Society of St. Thomas.  Tickets for "Barefoot Brunch with the Butterflies" are available at The Butterfly Farm, the Humane Society of St. Thomas, the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce, and How 'Bout Your Pet.</p>

<p>The event is the brainchild of Sharon Tait, Manager of The Butterfly Farm, and Carol Pazik, Marketing Director of West Indies Corporation.  According to Ms. Tait, "We wanted to develop an event that would bring needed revenues to the Humane Society but also provide a fun, family-oriented outing for adults and children.  The Butterfly Farm is the perfect venue for this.  I am so pleased that Barefoot Wines volunteered to help underwrite some of the costs of the event and provide appealing brunch beverages," she explained.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Humane Society will be on hand to discuss the organization's many programs, including adoptions, spay-neuter benefits, humane education, memberships, and the new Humane Care Campus.  According to Andrea Martin, a member of the Humane Society's board of directors, "We are so grateful to The Butterfly Farm and Barefoot Wines for their efforts on behalf of the Humane Society.  The Humane Society provides so many services to the community, many unrecognized by the public.  Current economic conditions have impacted our revenues, so this fund raiser could not have come at a better time."</p>

<p>For further information, contact Sharon Tait at The Butterfly Farm (715-3366) or Andrea Martin of the Humane Society (774-9791).</p>

There is a weekend in late March when St. Thomas becomes the place to be for sailors and sailor-wannabes alike. Leading up to this three day event, a steady stream of sailboats - big and small - make their way into American Yacht Harbor and Yacht Haven Grande while their skippers and crew anxiously await some competitive racing. Men and women travel to St. Thomas from all over the Caribbean, North America, and Europe to be a part of this exciting event. And while most of the event takes place off the downtown waterfront and Cowpet Bay, there are other curious activities happening behind the scenes right before the first gun signals the race start. <br />

<p>The harbor of St. Thomas is probably the finest natural harbor in the West Indies. Formed by an extinct volcano crater, it is protected on all sides, with a narrow opening to the south, and a consistent depth of ten meters. </p>

<p>In 1843 the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company (RMSPC) selected St. Thomas as the hub of all its operations in the northern West Indies. <br />

<p>International Rolex Regatta weekend in the U.S. Virgin Islands is a high point for many yachtsmen and yachtswomen from around the world. Known as the "Crown Jewel of the Caribbean", for some it represents an opportunity to shake off the winter dust in preparation for a hard summer's racing. For others, it is a chance to mix sailing and racing with a family vacation in one of the Caribbean's favorite locations. Whatever the reason, once experienced, the International Rolex Regatta becomes an annual mark on the calendar. The warm clear waters, beautiful surroundings and excellent competition draw you back year after year.</p>

While the other US Virgin Islands may hustle and bustle, St. John is a laid-back bit of Caribbean paradise. Two-thirds of the island was donated in 1956 to the United States by Laurance Rockefeller for use as a National Park. The result of his generosity created an unspoiled get-away offering tranquil beaches, sleepy lagoons, underwater coral gardens, scenic roads, well-maintained walking trails, lush foliage and fascinating plantation ruins.</p>

Very little of the vegetation that is so much part of our Caribbean horticultural scene today is indigenous to the islands. Captain Bligh of the Bounty carried breadfruit from Africa and coconuts from Malaysia. Bananas and plantains stem from the Canary Islands, as does sugar cane. From Mexico, Central and South America came papaya, poinsettias, cashews, genips and allemanda. Tamarind and African tulip trees, guinea grass and many local vegetables are from Africa; Madagascar produced flamboyants. Hibiscus first bloomed in Hawaii and frangipani flourished in Asia.<br />

<p><img src="http://www.virginislandsthisweek.com/images/underwater-photography-3.jpg" width="300" height="443" align="right" hspace="8" border="0" alt="underwater-photography-3.jpg"/>One of the biggest attractions in the Caribbean is what lies below the surface of the sea. Teeming with plant life, coral and fish, the clear waters surrounding the Virgin Islands present an inviting canvas for undersea photographers. </p>

<p>Whether you simply want to take home a few snapshots or are a serious photographer, you won't be disappointed with the variety of subject matter. You will, however, have different requirements in terms of skill and equipment. </p>

<p>Snorkelers can get some great photographs of coral, fish, sea urchins and the like, but won't be able to get shots of some of the more spectacular life and colors below the surface. For that, diving is required. </p>

A few have dressing facilities and showers - Coki (at Coral World) and Magen's Bay on St. Thomas; Cinnamon and Trunk Bay on St. John. Some hotel beaches have beach chair/umbrella rentals and restaurant/bars nearby, such as Frenchman's Reef Morningstar Beach and Sapphire Beach. It is advisable to leave valuables at your hotel unless you have a plastic container to take them along on your swim or snorkeling while at the beach. Avoid the mid-day sun. Start out with a 20 minute exposure with suntan lotion on your first few days. Even sitting in the shade can result in sunburn.</p>

                              <p>The U.S Territories (St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix) and the British Virgin Islands (to the north and east) are among the most beautiful geographical areas in the world, blessed with powdery beaches and sun-drenched weather.</p>

<p>The islands lie in the path of soft tradewinds blowing direct from Portugal. Which perhaps accounts for the fact that "Santa Cruz" was among the first islands to be sighted by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage westward. He then sailed northeast, passing St Thomas, St John and Tortola and called them collectively Las Vierges.</p>

We call them "sugar mills" because they were built, most in the 18th century, to grind up sugar cane once grown on island plantations.</p>

<p>If they look like windmills from Holland, it is because they are indeed a Dutch type of mill with a dome at the top, and four canvas sails (later movable wooden shutters or louvers) on wooden arms facing into the wind. Dutch settlers, in fact, introduced sugar cane and the process for making it to the lower West Indies in the early 1600s.</p>

<p>How did the mills work? Inside was machinery, with three upright iron-plated rollers. The middle one, which turned the other two by cogs, was attached by a central pole to the sail and axle mechanism at the top of the mill. Our almost constant trade winds would blow the sails with a strong enough force to turn the works below as cane stalks were fed through the rollers. Juices extracted by the grinding ran downhill to factory buildings where enslaved laborers produced brown sugar, white sugar, molasses, and rum for export. Nothing was wasted -- dried out leftover cane stalks became fuel for fires under copper pots used to boil the cane juice.</p>

She had a tasteful wrist corsage and he had a boutonniere. But both wore SCUBA tanks, too, as Toni Wilson wed John Santino underwater off Frederiksted on September 13, 2003, with 106 fellow divers in attendance. The ceremony is believed to have broken a previous record for the largest number of divers underwater for a wedding, set in 2001 when 39 divers were on hand for one in Florida.</p>

<p>Whale watching has become an "eco-phenomenon" in many places of the world: Iceland, Galapagos, New Zealand, artic Canada and California are just a few of the places known for whale watching. But you do not have to travel halfway around the world to see whales; there's whale watching right here in the waters off both St. John and St. Thomas.<p /></p>

<p>ST. THOMAS, USVI - Everybody loves a winner, and at the International Rolex Regatta in St. Thomas, USVI, every class winner takes home a Rolex timepiece. But winning isnit everything, since fundamentally itis the fun, sun, blue water and dependable trade winds that have helped make this event an indelible mark on every ambitious sailoris spring competition calendar.  For certain, sailors from the Islands, the U.S. mainland and far reaches of the globe will travel to St. Thomas to participate in the International Rolex Regatta, as they have annually for 35 years.  From Friday, March 28 through Sunday, March 30, up to 100 boats will participate on challenging courses that wind around islands and include a run from the East End of St. Thomas, where event host St. Thomas Yacht Club is located, to the Harbor at Charlotte Amalie, the capital and center of shopping and cruise boat activity for the island.

<p><img src="http://www.virginislandsthisweek.com/images/pistarckle-photo-2.jpg" width="200" height="78" align="right" alt="pistarckle-photo-2.jpg"/>Brochures promoting the 17th season of Pistarckle Theater on St. Thomas, at Tillet Gardens, highlight the phrase "Unveiling our new 2007-2008 Season" in bold, black script splashed across a crimson stage curtain. </p>

<p>The word "Pistarckle" is derived from a Dutch Creole word, "spektakel." It means "noise or confusion" according to Nicola Emerich, co-founder of the Theater. Nicola (Nikki) Emerich and her husband, architect Brian Emerich, founded the Theater together in 1991. "I have a passion for theater," Nikki explains. "It can be noisy and sometimes confusing, because it's live, but it is not boring.</p>

Though well known for its quality shops and dining establishments, Mongoose Junction is also enjoyed as a beautiful example of 18th century Danish building technique with a modern twist. Walking through archways made from local stone, and over walkways spanning the brook that runs from the mountainside to the bay, it is easy to forget that the oldest buildings around you are only 30 years old.</p>

<p />Mongoose Junction began in 1978 as the realization of a dream to bring together local artisans in an inspirational setting. Glen Speer, who moved to St. John in 1969 after attending UC Berkeley,
loves the cultural heritage and physical beauty of the island. His vision has given artisans, merchants and shoppers a venue unlike any other in the Virgin Islands. Mongoose Junction is built of local stone, coral, brick, and mahogany, with gutters and columns cast in place. Strolling through the junction, along walkways and courtyards shaded by mature trees, thick foliage, orchids and other local flora, you can"t help but share in Glen Speer's inspiration. Keep your eyes open for the authentic colonial era glass bottles included in the masonry walls of the buildings.

If you want to experience Christmas Day at its island best, then head to Emancipation Garden at dawn. There, in the heart of Charlotte Amalie, on St. Thomas, as the first rays of sun break over the horizon, dozens of voices blend in a sea of beautiful melodies at the outdoor concert known as the Challenge of the Carols. Yes, you'll get goose bumps. Yes, your heart will sing. Yes, the holiday spirit comes alive in a way you may never have experienced but will always remember. 

<p />"In the old days, choirs formed, either from local churches or groups of friends. They would start caroling right after midnight on Christmas Eve, maybe before, and go from house to house singing until dawn," explains Myron Jackson, director of the state historical office at the V.I. Government's Department of Planning and Natural Resources.

<p>As mankind goes about his work as a creator or innovator, it is often relatively easy to look back and trace developments. We know when the first plane flew, who invented the stoplight, and how penicillin was discovered. But in the case of black coral jewelry, coveted by the rich and famous, most people agree that the shift in development as an art form began in the Cayman Islands 30 years ago. It is now known around the world for the evocative and masterful works Bernard K. Passman has created using the material. "Passman made it into a truly artistic medium by creating abstractions or imaginative pieces, in effect, works of art."</p>

<p>He began working as an artist during World War II and following his retirement as a land developer in 1961, Passman turned his full attention to his first love, sculpting. In short order, he acquired an international reputation and distinguished commissions in wood, stone, metal, and clay. Among his most notable works is the 21-foot Presidential Tree that received recognition from the President of the United States. The sculpture was featured at the Republican National Convention in 1968 and the Democratic National Convention in 1972.</p>

<p>You have got to do St. John. You hear that from everyone who has visited the Island and from those who live here. But, what does it mean to do St. John? Well, there are the wonderful hiking trails that meander through the island that can take you from the "bustling" town of Cruz Bay to secluded beaches and pristine Caribbean forests. How about touring the island on a two-hour tour of the National Park or just go shopping in Cruz Bay? And don't forget the plethora of beaches.</p>

<p>Myra Linn Peck is a dedicated shell collector. "Believe me," she says with a twinkle, "You can collect a lot of shells in 80 years, and I have, all over the world: Florida, California, the far Pacific Islands, Hawaii - and for the last 27 years - right here on St. Thomas." </p>

<p>Technically, shells are the outer skeletons of soft-bodied animals called mollusks. The vast majority of mollusks are found on continental shelves and coral reefs in depth of less than 400 feet. The color of shells is probably determined by reaction to light, which is why the most highly colored specimens are usually found in shallow water. </p>

<p>Agriculture has always had deep cultural and historical roots throughout the Caribbean region and the Virgin Islands are no exception. Arawak and Carib Indians, the first known agriculturists in the region, complemented the bounty of the seas by planting peppers, yams, beans, sweet potatoes, corn and cassava. During the heyday of plantation agriculture, cotton, tobacco, indigo and sugarcane fields covered much of the islands. Enslaved Africans commonly grew provisions and raised livestock for local consumption. Later on, after the demise of the plantations, large tracts of land on the eastern end of St. Thomas were devoted to raising livestock. French immigrants from the island of St. Barts began arriving in the mid 19th century. Many settled on the north side of the island where they fished and farmed. These days their presence is not as pervasive as it once was, but for decades, "Frenchie" farmers were a mainstay in providing fresh produce to the island's residents. Up until 1995, for example, Holstein cows were an integral part of a dairy located in the hills above Magens Bay. </p>

<p>Mongoose, iguanas and thrushies, oh my! The Virgin Islands boast a curious collection of critters you won't find in many other locations, not even Kansas or Oz.</p>

<p><img alt="mongoose.jpg" src="http://www.virginislandsthisweek.com/images/mongoose.jpg" width="242" height="346" align="right" />Scientists know him as Herpestes auropunctatus, while kids call him Rikki- Tikki-Tavi. The <b>mongoose</b> was brought to the Caribbean from India in 1870 to help control the rat population in sugar cane fields. Nine mongooses seeded all the long, slim, catsized critters you see scampering across the roadways today! Unfortunately, mongooses are diurnal, while rats are nocturnal. That means these two miss each other, with the mongoose hunting other critters, including birds, lizards, frogs and insects.<br clear="all" /></p>

<p><img alt="eiffel-tower.jpg" src="http://www.virginislandsthisweek.com/images/eiffel-tower.jpg" width="211" height="316" class="home" />From Frenchtown, just west of Charlotte Amalie's waterfront, to the French enclave on St. Thomas' North Side, the French community - locally known as 'Frenchies' - have played an important role in the settlement and development of our islands. So vive la France!</p>

<p>With dinners, dancing, a fishing tournament and family fun, French Heritage Week (July 7-15) celebrates the importance of our French culture and customs.</p>

<p>France once claimed many Caribbean islands, including Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Lucia, St. Martin and Haiti. French settlers first came to the Virgin Islands in the 1600s. The French flag flew over St. Croix for many years before the Danish united the Virgin Islands in 1733.</p>

<p>Immigration from the nearby island of St. Barthelemy - commonly called St. Barths - brought an influx of settlers whose descendants remain in the USVI today. Frenchies were mainly cotton farmers, but a failing market forced them to find other means to survive.</p>

Animal encounter programs are a growing trend around the world according to Allegra Kean, former Director of Marketing at Coral World. Peter Noah, Coral World vice president of operations adds, "People want to experience the excitement and rush of being very close to the animals." Certainly guests who enter Lorikeet Garden, a 1,600 square-foot walk-through aviary, can expect to be thrilled by the free flying, friendly birds they encounter in the enclosure. All birds are captive born and hand-raised, which means they are very comfortable around people. In fact Noah notes, "Of all the birds I've worked with, lorikeets are by far the most entertaining. They are natural clowns, very acrobatic, and inquisitive about people."</p>
