              <div id="p7ABc1_1" class="p7ABcontent">
                <p>Sixteen years after leaving Utah State University with a degree in business management, Boyd Baugh found himself in his garage. It was 1973. The economic misery index was revving its depressing engine, Watergate was in full flower and an energy crisis was heating up. But this was Silicon Valley and Boyd (and his co-founder) had big plans. The Baugh family garage was their warehouse/workshop and a converted bedroom was the office for Space Designs, Inc.—their school furniture and equipment start-up.</p>
                <p>In the mid-70’s, the partners took a decisive step. They became Herman Miller dealers and the garage was history. Twenty plus years later, Pivot Interiors (their new name) was America’s largest Herman Miller dealer. </p>
                <p>Born and raised in Logan, Utah, young Boyd worked in various family businesses to learn the ideals of work and business ethics and he broadened that experience by living in Denmark for 2-1/2 years as a representative of his church. </p>
                <p>In addition to his degree at Utah State, he was a Distinguished ROTC Graduate, completed an active tour and a seven-year reserve obligation. His first job as employment manager with (then) Thiokol Chemical taught him volumes as the company added 5000 jobs in four years. </p>
                <p>He left aerospace and accepted an offer in school furniture sales, became top producer and sales manager. He had found his calling. In succession, he became a planning consultant, then general manager of a large dealer in the Bay Area. Eventually, when the entrepreneurial spirit tapped him on the shoulder, Boyd was ready. </p>
                <p>Today, Pivot Interiors remains a leader in facility services and he remains a leader among furniture, civic, university and church associations. It’s a lot to do for a grandfather of 12.</p>

                <p>He wasted no time with career trial and error. Oklahoma born, bred and educated, his first job was at a Norman radio station – working as an announcer. He was hooked. </p>
                <p>He took slight detour with the Air Force; then returned to Enid for his second broadcasting job. </p>
                <p>His career took a giant step in 1961 with ABC New York, as director of advertising and promotion for the seven-owned stations. </p>
                <p>In rapid succession, he climbed the ladder – VP/general manager of KGO in San Francisco; VP/general manager of WABC, NY. He took both to #1 in their respective markets and served as president of the NYC Broadcaster’s Association. </p>
                <p>Then, it was VP/GM of Channel 7 back in San Francisco and another #1 ranking that earned a promotion to LA’s KABC-TV. </p>
                <p>With no let-up, he was president of the California Broadcaster’s and a member of the board of directors of the National Association of Broadcasters. </p>
                <p>Kaiser Industries wanted him to be president of their five TV stations and he took the organization from an annual loss of $2 million to a profit of $20 million – in three years. </p>

                <p>Raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, Bill Dauer witnessed family struggles born from the Depression. </p>
                <p>His parents didn’t make it past sixth grade, but economic hardship had no impact on his family’s love, support and sacrifice.  And not surprisingly, Bill carried their sense of community into his own life, eventually becoming the influential builder of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. The road to San Francisco presented its own set of challenges. </p>
                <p>He was a Marine Raider during WWII, served on the Staff/Command Board in SF and along the way earned his BA in finance and management at Nebraska Wesleyan University. </p>
                <p>When Bill took the Chamber post years later, the city sat on the economic development shelf. He organized 27 international trade missions, attracting 18 international banks and a sizable number of headquarter companies. He took top execs to major U.S. cities to sell SF.  He attracted some of the nation’s top business leaders to serve on his Board. </p>
                <p>When the Dauer dust settled, the Chamber had a 10 department, 55-person staff, increased its budget six times and became the nation’s largest – all accomplished through private funding. </p>
                <p>Bill’s life after the Chamber didn’t slow a bit. He became a PCC principal for a short while, created an Economic Development Corporation in Springfield, Mo., and co-chaired the move of the Dallas Texans to Kansas City (Chiefs). </p>
                <p>Currently, he serves on many boards and foundations, is director of the SF Sports Hall of Fame, and was the first executive elected to the Board of the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>

                <p>When she plops down a bottle of her favorite pinot noir on the counter of a San Francisco Safeway, Hanna Derry is often required to show ID. Getting &quot;carded&quot; at a food store seems a bit hysterical, considering that Hanna is a Managing Director of BlackRock, the world's largest investment manager. But she's not complaining. Looking young never got in her way.</p>
                <p>Born and raised in Oregon, she was graduated with honors at Oregon State in 1997 with a BA in international relations and wasted no time hitting the financial services fast track.</p>
                <p>Early experience took her to on-line-retailing, help desk management and software training. She found success at start-up ePIT, Inc., and later at the Pacific Exchange. In 2006, based on her record of turning around floundering teams and projects, Barclays Global Investors (BGI) tapped her to transform a strategic project for an electronic trading system. Subsequently, three short years later, Blackrock acquired BGI and Hanna assumed responsibilities for teams dedicated to the integration of the two firms.</p>
                <p>Currently, she's responsible for development and maintenance of systems for the global departments of Index &amp; iShares Portfolio Management, iShares Product Management, Transitions Services and Securities Lending &#8212; including platforms that manage over $1T in assets, as well as teams in six countries.</p>
                <p>To expedite business, travel demands and personal interests, she plans a second residence in Hawaii where her family roots trace almost a century. Hanna's devotion to her own career is matched by a dedication to mentoring and coaching aspiring women in their careers, especially in the financial services and technology sectors.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, she's a sustaining member of the Junior League of San Francisco, as well as a member of the Business Advisory Council of the Dominican University Graduate School of Business and the Daughters of the American Revolution.</p>

His ability to understand his audiences and present his message in a relaxed manner often laden with humorous anecdotes helps alter what could be a dry delivery of information.</p>
                <p>With the clear direction to “Be Yourself”, his quiet private practice today in tax planning in Marin County affords him the opportunity to continue pursuing his goal to broaden his knowledge base.

                <p>During his boyhood in the 50's in Sheffield, Illinois, Con Hewitt was a paperboy, grass mower, window washer, bank janitor, high school football team captain, and polio victim (gratefully, a mild case).</p>
                <p>Approximately 60 years later, the boy who learned the supreme value of a penny and the stark lessons of adversity retired as Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The long road to the pinnacle of the accounting world began routinely enough with a BS in finance from the University of Illinois, and picked up speed with a tour of duty in the air force at SAC headquarters where Con immersed himself in auditing and accounting. By then, he was married to a TWA stewardess from Illinois and contemplated accepting offers to return home. But an offer from Ernst &amp; Ernst (later Ernst &amp; Young), coupled with an urge to avoid Midwest weather, motivated the couple to head west and they never looked back.</p>
                <p>Con thrived at E&amp;Y. From LA to Hawaii to Washington and San Francisco, he carved an illustrious 33-year career, becoming managing partner in 10 years. There, he developed a strong background as a financial institution regulator, was chairman of 10 audit committees and a director.  He also was trustee of two pension plans and a private charitable foundation.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, from 1995-1998, Con was California Superintendent of Banking where he created the new Department of Financial Institutions and became its first Commissioner. In these roles, he was responsible for the supervision and regulation for over 1000 various types of financial institutions. In the years prior to his SEC appointment, Con was a financial consultant and corporate director.</p>
                <p>Today, he remains active as a director of the Bank of The West, a member of its Audit Committee, and Investment and Loans Committee. In addition, he sits on many other boards, travels internationally, and speaks publicly on a wide variety of financial, accounting and auditing matters. And during this financial bustle, Con invariably finds time to audit as many golf courses as he can reasonably visit.</p>

                <p>She co-founded McCall Staffing in San Francisco and currently is president of EA Search, specializing in recruiting and consulting for exec assistants.

                <p>He and his partners located the new distributorship in Boise for a single reason --- access to world-class fishing. They weren’t disappointed. The fishing was great, but business proved even better. </p>
                <p>When one of the founders opted to leave the firm, Steve and the other partner bought and split his shares. By 1992, annual revenues had reached $36MM. When his remaining original partner sold out, Steve acquired majority interest and CEO responsibility. </p>
                <p>In the next eight years, he grew the business to $81MM and achieved his lifelong goal – retire on his 50th birthday. Only he hasn’t retired. </p>

                <p>Most accounting majors stress out before taking their CPA exams following graduation. Scott Sangalli avoided the anxiety. He simply became a CPA while he was still an undergraduate at Western Illinois University.<br />
                    <br />
                  Scott’s hustle was signal of things to come. He worked in public accounting for a couple of years but quickly discovered that “counting” other people’s money put him on the wrong side of the fence.<br />
                  <br />
                  He jumped over it to become CEO of a mid-size manufacturing and construction company, and two years later hooked up with two partners to start up a pre-cast concrete business in Texas. The partners sold the business and Scott joined wholesale plumbing distributor Morrison Supply.<br />
                  <br />
                  Despite a good reputation in the early 80’s, the company was failing. But not for long. Scott bought Morrison in 1986. Since then, the distributorship has grown from six to 76 branches in the Southwest and sales rocketed from $18MM to $600MM.<br />
                  <br />
                  Today, the Morrison group of companies employs over 1200 people and has expanded into utilities, HVAC, appliances, retail showrooms &amp; design centers.<br />
                  <br />
                  Scott is Morrison’s Chairman and CEO, and is predictably active in local and regional civic, professional and philanthropic associations. And he has every intention to remain on his side of the fence.</p>

His consulting experience includes work in over 20 countries worldwide.</p>
                <p>David calls his defining career move &#8220;exquisite timing.&#8221; In November, 1984, five years removed from his B.A. at the University of Virginia, he hired on to manage a &#8220;small trade association.&#8221; This was barely three months after Senator Russell Long had pushed through legislation dramatically improving the federal tax incentives for ESOPs. That small trade association grew like gangbusters and he rode that wave for the next six years, helping to grow the ESOP Association four-fold.</p>
                <p>From there David went to the Beyster Institute established by Dr. J. Robert Beyster, the founder of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) which was a leading exemplar of a high-growth, high-tech, 100% employee-owned company. Today SAIC has annual revenues over $10 billion. For 17 years at Beyster, he provided a broad range of consulting services to companies interested in implementing equity-based compensation programs. He also led the Institute's international development work to promote the growth of entrepreneurship and employee ownership.</p>
                <p>Currently, he serves as COO and member of the board of directors of Macfadden &amp; Associates, Inc., a federal government contracting company. Macfadden's more than 200 employee-owners provide a variety of specialized government services related to information technology, financial systems management, homeland security, program management and international disaster remediation.</p>
                <p>A published author and frequent speaker related to employee ownership and enterprise development, he is co-editor and contributing author of Employee Stock Ownership Plans: ESOP Planning, Financing, Implementation, Law and Taxation, a two-volume technical reference to ESOPs published in 2007; and Employee Financial Participation: An International Survey, published in 2008.</p>
                <p>Kentucky born and D.C. and Virginia raised, David clings to the mid-Atlantic region. By living and working in Silver Spring, Md., he lists his 1.5-mile commute as a personal strategic milestone.</p>

                <p>In 1990, the faculty of Harvard Business School asked MBA student Mike Durham to tutor first-year students. Their decision was a sure thing because they knew Durham was no tenderfoot business scholar.  He was fresh from a seven-year stint with The Proctor &amp; Gamble Company where he vaulted through company ranks to manage dozens of people and complex system operations.</p>
                <p>It was this practical corporate experience that led Durham to Harvard, realizing he needed a broader foundation if he expected to realize his business goals. He didn't have long to wait. He immediately connected with Burlington Industries. In 1993 he was named National Sales Manager; 1996 became Vice President of sales, and in 1999 led the Upholstery Division as its Executive Vice President. In 2002 his entrepreneurial attitude and management style landed him as Group President of Tietex Interiors, to start up a new division for Tietex International, Ltd. In spring, 2009, he partnered with Burlington Manufacturing Services to purchase Interiors from Tietex and launch Se7en, a new textile venture that he leads as CEO. </p>
                <p>Durham's penchant for achievement and leadership surfaced early at N.C. State University.  He earned his BS in industrial engineering, cum laude, and became a member of the Tau Beta Pi and Alpha Pi Mu engineering honor societies.

In eight months, he cleared up 15 arbitration cases and 50 unresolved grievances. He later accepted an offer to be director of human resources and eventually a division head for Riegel.</p>
                <p> When he was 38, Bob became president of Valdese Weavers and in 16 years presided over a 1700% increase in profits. Bob mentored his successor at Valdese and left the company in 2001 to establish Mckinnon, Land and Moran and Basofil Fibers LLC. He is currently a major shareholder in those companies.</p>

                <p>At the McShane household in 1951, two cataclysmic events shook their South Bronx neighborhood. Brian was born and Bobby Thomson hit “the shot heard ‘round the world” that won the National League pennant for the New York Giants. Six years later, the Giants moved to San Francisco. </p>
                <p>But Brian learned to appreciate baseball, when on summer nights his Dad would take him and his brothers on the roof to listen to the raucous cheers from nearby Yankee Stadium. Although the family eventually moved to Long Island, Brian would never venture far from the Big Apple. </p>
                <p>He earned his college degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz, recently named one of the “hottest 25 schools in America.” </p>
                <p>Out of school, he dipped his feet into entry-level jobs and then made two life-changing decisions – simultaneously. He married Eileen and joined the Advertising Checking Bureau in 1979. Today, both unions thrive. </p>
                <p>He began his ACB career as a research sales rep and in succession became national sales manager, VP, Board member and President, CEO (1996). </p>
                <p>Brian’s rise to the top was rocky. He reached it by guiding ACB through a restructuring and then by building the team that turned things around. </p>
                <p>Now the largest company of its kind, ACB has approximately 400 employees working in N. Y., Arizona and Tennessee. And, true to his roots, Brian takes great satisfaction serving on the SUNY at New Paltz Foundation Board.</p>

                <p>His son David runs the show but Nick is still active, wearing his signature bow tie and sporting a penetrating wit, now legendary among generations of fellow workers. </p>
                <p>Unlike many corporate kingpins, Nick didn’t travel through an MBA factory; rather, by way of his father’s coal and ice business and later a 30’x 60’ tomato canning factory the teenager built with his bare hands. When he wasn’t shoveling 10 tons of coal a day, he helped the elder Nickell make ice and learned the basics of refrigeration by the time he was 14. </p>
                <p>A Bosch &amp; Lombe high school science award led him to a University of Virginia scholarship, and his penchant for physics qualified him to teach naval students during WW II. </p>
                <p>Ensign Nickell served in the Merchant Marines before returning to college with the help of his wife Del. </p>
                <p>In 1948, degree in hand, he joined the Air Conditioning Corporation and his boyhood lessons immediately flowered. Western Electric Company selected Nick to design and construct the world’s first production-size ‘clean room.”</p>
                <p> His career flourished. He and three other senior people acquired company stock from the founder and Grason Nickell was on his way to lead an employee-owned company to new levels of achievement and prosperity.</p>

                <p>The streets of Brooklyn will prepare anyone for anything. When his family left N.Y. for the tough mill town of Gastonia, N.C., and forced their 3rd grader to wear sissy short pants to school in the winter, character was born out of necessity. Many bloody noses later, barely 17, he took an academic scholarship to Duke University and promptly flunked out. That failure was the beginning of success.</p>
                <p>After one aimless year, Toomey finally grew up in the military and made his most important decision -- marrying Nancy. Six years later, the couple had two sons, and Toomey had a degree in journalism from the University of South Carolina. A year of graduate school and teaching assistantship motivated him not to teach and it was off to be public relations director of what today is Eckerd College. Between 1964-1978, he pulled corporate communications duty with S.C. Electric &amp; Gas, the State-Record Company and Duke Power.  And, in this interim, became a father twice more.</p>
                <p>In 1979, Toomey decided to pursue honest work in sales with The Alderman Company in High Point, N.C. Three years later, in a mid-life panic, he and two partners founded Tatum Toomey Whicker, a marketing agency specializing in advertising, location photography and sales promotion. The company perished in 2006 and Toomey founded Steam Marketing LLC. (www.steammarketing.com) </p>

                <p>The man they called “Sunny Joe” grew up working. He lived on the wrong side of the tracks in Binghamton, N. Y., and was well aware of how the other half lived. </p>
                <p>When he was 12, he had a Collier’s magazine route and every month he contributed $5 of the $30 family rent payment. He saved money. He bought his own clothes, the kind rich kids wore. In the summers he helped his father deliver milk in a horse-drawn wagon. </p>
                <p>When his father was promoted to supervisor, Joe moved up too, working as the only waiter in an Italian restaurant. The tips were small but the volume was big and he pulled in $50 a week in tips alone, more than his father’s salary. He saved more, thanks to his mother’s influence. Fiscal responsibility became ingrained. </p>
                <p>He was only 17 when he enlisted in the navy, was accepted for officer’s training and received pay as a college ROTC student. He put that money aside, too. The navy brought Sunny Joe to Hawaii and there he adopted his new home. </p>
                <p>He took a job with food giant Swift and learned the business from top to bottom, He transferred to Seattle to run the firm’s sausage kitchen but had every intention of returning to the Islands. After brief excursions with other opportunities, his former Swift associate and friend Art Hanson called him to offer a partnership in a fledgling food business, Joe jumped at the chance. He was 28. </p>
                <p>The pair was inseparable as owners for four decades. Hansen Foods became one of the largest solid food wholesalers around. </p>
                <p>After Art passed away, Joe continued leading the company until it was sold in 1993.</p>
                <p> Hansen Foods, with many long-standing employees, prospers to this day. Joe is part of the Hawaiian scene as philanthropist and civic leader.</p>

                <p>Tom Driskill literally jumped his way through college. But he had some qualified help – the muscular horses he rode to multiple state jumping championships in North Carolina. The horses earned most of the admiration and Tom financed his way through Wake Forest, earning his own reward with a degree in business administration. Raised in the Old North State, he was destined to leap over his own obstacles before landing halfway around the world. The stops along the way honed his credentials.  From Wake, he went straight to the US military. In Vietnam, as combat medic, he ministered to individual soldiers. And somebody noticed. He became executive officer to the US Army Surgeon General, responsible for a worldwide healthcare delivery system. While on active duty he completed his MBA at DePaul as well as military leadership training to include a sabbatical at the US Army War College. What followed were successful tours of duty as Medical Battalion Commander, Medical Brigade Commander, Community Hospital Administrator and Medical Center Commander. Major healthcare challenges became his way of life -- system reorganizations, budget reductions, RIF, forced salary cuts, mass casualties and even a 21- alarm hospital fire. The intensity and the scrutiny weren't wasted. Tom's three decades of military service easily transitioned into the public/private sector. Just recently, he completed 13 years as leader of Hawaii Health Systems Corporation (HHSC), a major public benefit organization composed of 14 hospitals and one assisted living center. As President &amp; CEO, he was the sole employee of the Board of Directors. Some 4000 employees operated in a heavily politicized environment. Year after year, Tom carried the system forward through upheavals in Medicare, Medicaid and 3rd party insurance. The key to success, he says, was being able to in lead an institution that was both culturally and geographically diverse. Relying on adaptability, he created 501c3 foundations to support the hospitals and used video-teleconference/telemedicine technology to maintain synergy – keeping key organizational elements functioning as a team. That experience behind him, Tom's still not through with healthcare. As a disabled veteran, he's active with federal healthcare throughout the Pacific Rim, taking him throughout Hawaii, and to Samoa, Guam and the Marianas. Planted firmly in Hawaii with his wife Bonnie and three boys, he also finds time, in partnership with his oldest son Tommy III, to serve as CEO of Dotodo, LLC, a business that serves the entertainment industry.</p>

                <p>The name doesn’t look or sound it, but Bob Midkiff is Hawaiian through and through. </p>
                <p>His Father was an educator from Illinois and his Mother was a Kamaaina descendant of Amos Starr and Juliette Cooke who came to the Islands with the seventh group of missionaries in 1837. </p>
                <p>Not surprisingly, therefore, Bob grew up on a school campus, graduated at the head of his class and eventually was Phi Beta Kappa at Yale. </p>
                <p>At 23 he joined the Army, completed OCS, returned to Yale for Japanese studies and ultimately became aide to the military governor of Japan. </p>
                <p>But Hawaii beckoned. He signed on with Hawaiian Trust Company and by the time he was 32 became one of the nation’s foremost authorities on profit sharing plans. Within the next decade, Bob had installed over 1000 plans throughout the Islands. </p>
                <p>His reputation and further experience in corporate profit sharing plans prompted the native son to launch American Trust Company (later named American Financial Services). Over a 20 year span the firm grew from three employees and private investment of $550K to 300 employees managing $4 billion in assets. </p>
                <p>The Bank of Hawaii (now Pacific Century) purchased AFS for $53 million -- shared with employees, management partners and founding shareholders. </p>
                <p>What has been called “Midkiff’s Aloha Spirit” now has him busier than ever with a number of philanthropic foundations. </p>

Alternating spring and fall semesters in three places, he received his high school diploma from Honolulu’s noted Punahou School. </p>
                <p>He spent his high school summers on Kauai working in his father’s electrical construction business; and when time came to choose a college from those that accepted his application, he picked a most distant location from Hawaii – Notre Dame. </p>
                <p>Following four South Bend winters and with his BA in hand, he chose a law school based on the warmest climate – Loyola, New Orleans. He passed the bar, took a position as a trial attorney with the EEOC. </p>
                <p>By this time, he had met Pamela in law school and they married a year after he began work. In 1989, the couple returned to Kauai to run the family businesses that included R Electric and Rasco Supply. </p>
                <p>But first things first, Pamela and Robby passed the Hawaii bar exam in 1989. Robby and brother Randy acquired the assets of their father’s original companies and managed to survive very lean times, keeping three business afloat. </p>
                <p>By 2005-07, the companies had rebounded, and achieved record growth and profits. </p>
                <p>With his daughter’s acceptance at Punahou, Robby moved the family to Honolulu in 2005, where he manages the companies in both Kauai and Honolulu. </p>
