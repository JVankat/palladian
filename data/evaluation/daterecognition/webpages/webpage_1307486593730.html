The crossing did not have barriers.</p><p>Mitch Magee told the Cape Cod Times he flashed his truck's headlights and waved his hands out the window trying to get the driver's attention. The Cape Cod Central Railroad train blared its horn as it approached, he said, "but there was no way to get the train to stop in time."</p><p>Passenger Marie Kennedy, 81, was pronounced dead at the scene, and driver Claire Kennedy, 54, was taken to a hospital for injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. </p><span class="subhead">Student wins suit over Muslim scarf</span><br /><p>Muskogee, Okla.

School officials said her clothing violated a dress code banning hats, bandanas and other head coverings &#8211; a rule intended to curb gang-related activity.</p><p><table align='left'><tr><td></td></tr></table>In March, the Justice Department joined a lawsuit filed on her behalf by a Virginia-based civil rights group. A federal judge approved the settlement last month.</p><p>"This experience has been very stressful, very depressing and very humiliating," Hearn said.</p><p>Starting this fall, students can wear religious head coverings to school if they apply and have their requests approved by the school board, officials said.</p><p>Under the settlement, the district also must pay an undisclosed amount of money, said Leah Farish, Hearn's lawyer. The lawsuit had sought $80,000 in damages.</p><p> </p><span class="subhead">Fraternity disciplined over cannon</span><br /><p>Columbia, Mo.

The wounded pilot was identified as David Tilstra.</p><p>The gunman was killed near a trailer park, but it wasn't immediately clear whether he was killed by deputies on the ground or in the air, authorities said.

She is scheduled for release in February 2006.</p><p>Prosecutors said she had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents cause illnesses in a child to draw attention to themselves.</p><p>Jennifer Bush underwent about 40 operations before the state began investigating in 1996.</p><p>Kathy Bush has denied she ever did anything to hurt her daughter.</p><p>Before the criminal investigation began, Jennifer's illnesses and mounting medical bills garnered national attention when the girl and her mother went to the White House in 1994 to help lobby for health insurance improvements.</p><p>Because Kathy Bush had been banned from having any contact with Jennifer since 1999, two Broward Circuit judges had to agree to the correspondence.</p><p>A therapist will read any letters the mother writes. </p>
