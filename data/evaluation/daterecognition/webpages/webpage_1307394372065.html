<p>Yes. I truly believe that. A cacophony of events leading up to and surrounding Michael&#8217;s birthday brought all this together for me and I can make that statement with a great deal of certainty, judging by what I&#8217;ve seen regarding the way he was treated in his life, and by what I still see now in the current political, legal, and social landscape.</p>
<p>Besides Michael&#8217;s impending birthday, there were other things swirling around, which mixed current political events with our nation&#8217;s civil rights history in some very untoward, abusive, disingenuous, putrid, and sneaky ways. It made me realize how very little has changed when it comes to true racial equality and the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>First, there was Glenn Beck and the Tea Party&#8217;s attempt at &#8220;<em>reclaiming the civil rights movement</em>&#8221; on August 28th, the day before Michael&#8217;s birthday.  Now, Beck claims he didn&#8217;t know that this was the 47th anniversary of MLK&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.mlkonline.net/dream.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.mlkonline.net']);"><em>I Have a Dream</em></a>&#8221; speech. Once he found out he stated that his intent then was to &#8220;<em>reclaim</em>&#8221; the movement &#8211; a movement that he and the Tea Party initially had absolutely nothing to do with (thus &#8220;<em>reclaiming</em>&#8221; it is nonsense) and which we are very much not done with, thankyouverymuch. No, Mr. Beck you may not have it and you will not have it.</p>
<p>Whether Beck knew or did not know that August 28th was such an anniversary, his ignorance and/or arrogance is in my opinion astounding but nonetheless befitting a well-to-do white mouthpiece for a racist movement which is busily fomenting the kind of ignorance, hatred and division we&#8217;d hoped to be done with by this time in our history &#8211; and which Michael Jackson fought against all his life.</p>
<p>I share below a quote from another article about another anniversary on August 28th which many people are not aware of:</p>
<blockquote><p>What people have not recognized is that Dr. King&#8217;s 1963 speech itself fell on another significant anniversary&#8211;the August 28, 1955 lynching of Mother Mobley&#8217;s son, Emmett Till, who was accused of whistling at a white woman on his visit with relatives in the Mississippi Delta.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Eight years ago, I visited her on the anniversary of Emmett&#8217;s lynching. I brought flowers because, well, it just seemed like the right thing to do. She was despondent and told me that people always called her on the 28th of August. They would say, &#8220;You know what day this is, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; And she looked at me deeply with eyes that long ago had run out of tears and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need reminders. I can never forget this day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would want us to remember, too. Not just the event. But its meaning.</p>
<p>That is why Mother Mobley, a Chicago teacher who mined her grief for a mission in life, would see Saturday&#8217;s collision of symbols as a teachable moment. She understood the politics of difference, the politics of place. As an African American whose family had barely escaped Southern atrocities, she recognized the potential pushback when you stepped out of place. Like whistling at a white woman. Or living in the White House.</p>
<p>So she would see parallels between then and now. She could interpret the code, the messages of hate and racism that get embedded in the vocabulary of patriotism. Years ago, she tuned into what we all now recognize, in the parlance of Politico.com, as &#8220;<em>dog whistle politics</em>,&#8221; that perfect pitch of the rabid right.</p>

<p>Second, there are the Koch Brothers. These two very rich white guys are major funders of the Tea Party movement, though they don&#8217;t like it when their names are mentioned or seen in connection with it. Judging by the blatantly racist signs we&#8217;ve seen them waving at their rallys, I guess I don&#8217;t blame them for wanting to keep their support a secret. They have been by far one of Obama&#8217;s biggest detractors on virtually every issue, having waged a veritable political war against him since he took office. They covertly fund various think tanks such as Americans for Prosperity and the Cato Institute and many others, though their names are difficult if not impossible to find in connection with those organizations &#8211; and that is just the way they like it. These guys own oil companies, carpet manufacturers, paper towel brands, and many other corporate interests. Much like the Carlyle Group &#8211; they are one of the most influential owners and controllers of our society and political discourse you&#8217;ve never heard of. They&#8217;ve paid for busses to bus people to Tea Party events such as the one last Saturday, and one of the <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/96059/slideshow-glenn-beck-rally-mlk-march-and-afp-conference" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','washingtonindependent.com']);">Koch brothers himself spoke at Beck&#8217;s rally</a> along with Americans for Prosperity&#8217;s President Tim Phillips. Much more detail on these guys, their background, their covert political tentacles, and their modus operandi can be found here: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.newyorker.com']);">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all</a></p>
<p>Third, I watched in horror as Mr. Alan Simpson of the &#8220;<em>Deficit Reduction Commission</em>&#8221; <a href="http://smmercury.com/archives/14015" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','smmercury.com']);">railed nastily about Social Security</a> and those who depend on the program. His remarks seemed very typical of an out-of-touch well-cared-for politician who will never have to depend on that program for survival.  What was worse than what this guy said was what <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> happen after he said it. It took less than 24 hours for Shirley Sherrod to be ousted from her job within that administration &#8211; no questions asked &#8211; based upon a chopped-up, taken out-of-context YouTube video created by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Breitbart" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','en.wikipedia.org']);" target="_blank">notorious racist </a>which was meant to frame and target Ms. Sherrod (and whom she is now rightfully suing).  But Mr. Simpson got to keep his job &#8211; no questions asked. Racism? Sexism? Or just &#8220;<em>politics</em>&#8220;?  Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Fourth, various stories I picked up on during the week: An <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/local-filmmaker-cash-michaels-on-obama-wake-schools-and-race-in-nc/Content?oid=1625104" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.indyweek.com']);">article I read recently in an independent paper</a> talks about &#8216;<em>backlash</em>&#8216; &#8211; that seeing a black man in the White House is something that some people simply cannot take. I think there&#8217;s a lot to that, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/27/exclusivezeitoun_how_a_hero_in_new" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.democracynow.org']);">story I got wind of</a> was one where a Muslim man helped save some of his neighbors after Katrina in New Orleans. His &#8220;<em>reward</em>&#8221; for his kindness to his neighbors was being targeted by police, arrested for no reason other than being Muslim, being accused of being a terrorist and working with Al Queda, being put in prison for no reason other than he was Muslim, and denied communication with his wife and children the entire time.</p>
<p><strong>This is just exactly the kind of ignorance, hatred, and fear Michael Jackson railed against, sang against, and fought against all his life.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>We must learn to live and to love each other before it&#8217;s too late. We have to stop the prejudice, we have to stop the hating, we have to stop living in fear of our own neighbors</em>.</p>
<p>-Michael Jackson</p></blockquote>
<p>And lastly, while threats against a newly elected president usually increase right after an election, Barack Obama was the first black president ever elected. Because of that and because racism is still rampant in the United States, the <a href="http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/new-report-find-secret-service-overwhelmed-by-increased-threats.php" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com']);" target="_blank">threats against newly-elected President Obama spiked a shocking %400</a> percent or so.  This is unprecedented in the history of the United States.  Anyone harboring the idea that just because we managed to elect a black President, that racism is over, or that things have even improved that much, had better think again. This very obviously is far from the truth.</p>
<p>While there were other larger factors such as individual and corporate greed, pure jealousy, typical corporate parasitism and abuse (the modus operandi of disaster capitalism), and sheer competition for power and money, the destruction of Michael Jackson and his life is also tied inextricably into all this racist mess, past and present. Michael married Elvis&#8217;s daughter &#8211; a white woman. Emmett Till whistled at a white woman. Both were destroyed &#8211; lynched for it (and for other reasons too, in Michael&#8217;s particular case of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.pbs.org']);" target="_blank">unforgivable blackness</a>).</p>
<div id="attachment_5265" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 330px"><img class="size-full wp-image-5265  " title="Emmett Till" src="http://www.mj-777.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/emmitt-till21.jpg" alt="Emmitt Till " width="320" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Emmett Till </p></div>
<p>Michael Jackson was lynched because he had the talent, money, magnetism, the following, and the power to change the world and he tried through songs about loving and caring for all of humanity and the planet, healing the world. <strong>Those who benefit most from the status quo &#8211; those who profit so handsomely from the hatred, ignorance, division, and from the parasitic corporate greed under which we live &#8211; weren&#8217;t going to have any part of that being changed &#8211; especially by some black man who can sing and dance</strong>. He was lynched because he not only whistled at a white woman, he married one &#8211; the daughter of a white rock-and-roll icon no less. He was lynched because he had the audacity to buy and own white iconic group The Beatles, and own half of $ony. And as soon as Michel started noticeably selling records singing and dancing in the 1970s, the media started their campaign on him, and it spiraled out of control from there. The more famous and rich and powerful Michael Jackson became, the worse the negative definitions, the abuse and attempts at control and/or destruction became.</p>
<p>All Michael Jackson was ever &#8216;<em>guilty</em>&#8216; of was &#8216;<em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.pbs.org']);">Unforgivable Blackness</a></em>&#8216;, of having unprecedented talent, a heart bigger than he was, an <a href="http://www.mj-777.com/?p=2929" >innocent mind</a>, and an astute knowledge and unwavering focus on his purpose here on Earth. <strong>They didn&#8217;t lynch Michael Jackson with a noose but he was damn well lynched nonetheless</strong>.</p>
<p>The powers that be which benefit mightily from the status-quo, from things staying just as they are, weren&#8217;t going to have any part of allowing him any of this without a fight &#8211; without making him pay for what he&#8217;d done and was trying to do; for what they saw and evidently still see as an affront to white power and social, political, legal, and economic domination in this society. Thus, the the edict was simply: <em><strong>Destroy Him</strong></em>.  And so they did. Our political, legal, propaganda (media), capitalist, and social system was brought to destroy Michael Jackson emotionally, spiritually, professionally, and economically.  They can&#8217;t use rope anymore or hang them from a tree. Now, they simply use different means to lynch black men these days &#8211; and some white people too if they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/world/europe/02wikileaks.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.nytimes.com']);" target="_blank">get too close to the truth</a> and/or have too much power to change things from the status quo.</p>
<p>The strange fruit still hangs from the trees in the garden of hatred, division, ignorance and greed.  Not that much has changed, except the size of their mob and the methods they use.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To the imperial media Jackson was guilty of everything of which he had ever been accused, like Jack Johnson, Muhammad Ali and Martin Luther King, Elvis Presley and John Lennon. The problem with all of these and with Bob Marley, Patrice Lumumba and Jean Bertrand Aristide is that they connected in a fundamental way with ordinary people, and that, to the rulers of our world and their servile media, is supremely dangerous.</em> -<a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/?q=content/michael-jackson-and-piranhas-media" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.blackagendareport.com']);">John Maxwell</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Martin Luther King&#8217;s dream is not realized yet. <strong>NO</strong> &#8212;  Glenn Beck, you cannot &#8220;<em>reclaim</em>&#8221; the civil rights movement because you or this &#8220;<em>Tea Party</em>&#8221; were never part of it to start with, and because we are not done with it yet! The dream hasn&#8217;t yet materialized. Far, far from it.</p>
<p>There is so much work yet to be done. This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Backlash-Right-Wing-Radicals-High-Def-Hucksters/dp/0061991716/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1281457764&amp;sr=8-1" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.amazon.com']);">backlash</a> is backwards and that&#8217;s where these pitiable <a href="http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhismglossaryh/g/hungryghostdef.htm" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','buddhism.about.com']);" target="_blank">hungry ghosts</a> want to go: Backwards. They want to reverse what little forward progress has been made on this issue, and as we can see it&#8217;s much less than we might wish, and much less than we might think.</p>
<p>If MLK&#8217;s dream had been realized, Michael Jackson might have been alive today to celebrate his 52nd birthday with his beautiful children. But it hasn&#8217;t. And just like Emmett Till, Michael Jackson was lynched &#8211; for whistling at a white woman, and then marrying her. The marriage was defined as &#8220;<em>fake</em>&#8221; and a &#8220;<em>publicity stunt</em>&#8221; by the largely white-owned and controlled media, which could not deal with the fact that a white woman and a black man could actually love one another in a romantic sense.</p>
<p><strong>And just as significantly, it fed their ratings and profits to print and broadcast negative stories about Michael. The fact that he was black just made it that much easier</strong>.</p>
<p>Oh yes, they still lynch black people. And nothing has changed except the tools they use to do it.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we <strong>are not </strong>done.  We have so much work to do, and on and in between all of Michael Jackson&#8217;s birthdays that he isn&#8217;t here to celebrate because he was lynched just like Emmett Till only with a different kind of rope and for more reasons, we need to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Diane, a friend of mine, said <strong>&#8220;</strong><em><strong>Michael was much more than a man of “song and dance.” Michael was a heart that beat for the love of humanity</strong></em><strong>.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday August 28th, I spent 25 minutes talking to someone about these dots and how they all connected. That Glenn Beck gathering, The Koch Brothers and their covert operation to destroy Barack Obama&#8217;s Presidency, the contrast between how Shirley Sherrod and Alan Simpson were treated and the racist and sexist connotations of that, about Emmett Till and MLK and Michael Jackson and what was done to all of them and why;  about how when you want to destroy someone you find the one thing that is most near and dear to them &#8211; and that&#8217;s where you insert the knife. <strong>For Michael, that was children</strong>. <strong>They used what he loved most to destroy him</strong>.<strong> And it was intentional</strong>. And it was because he was a billionaire black man with power and influence who loved (literally and figuratively) all races and owned the music of some of the most prominent white icons of our times &#8211; and married one of their daughters. I talked about how ever since Michael bought the $ony/ATV catalog, it seemed that $ony declared war on the entity that was Michael Jackson in order to get and keep control of that catalog of music. He was too powerful, too loved, too loving, too rich, and had too much influence &#8211; and he was <strong>unforgivably black</strong>.</p>
<p>When they blather on about how <a href="http://www.mj-777.com/?p=974"  target="_blank">Michael &#8216;</a><em><a href="http://www.mj-777.com/?p=974"  target="_blank">hated being black</a></em><a href="http://www.mj-777.com/?p=974"  target="_blank">&#8216; and so wanted to bleach his skin</a>: Well, it wasn&#8217;t Michael Jackson who hated his blackness or his race. It was the people accusing Michael Jackson of hating his race &#8211; who hate his race. They are the one who hated Michael Jackson&#8217;s blackness. There was, IMO a whole lotta projection going on there. They wipe their filthy racist feet on Michael Jackson, their projected hatred smeared on his face like so much shit.</p>
<p>By the time I was done with my little rant, someone said to me:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>You know, there was a shadow of doubt in my mind about whether Michael was really innocent of the allegations against him. There was a part of me that still wasn&#8217;t sure. But now that I&#8217;ve listened to you, I am convinced he was innocent and I can see how all this ties together and it makes sense &#8211; what they did to him and why</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I just smiled. I don&#8217;t normally talk that much. Unless I&#8217;ve got something to say. Well, I had something to say. And I changed a mind about Michael that day and made someone who was believing a lot of the media crap and propaganda about him &#8211; see the truth.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Michael. It&#8217;s not much. But, it&#8217;s my gift to you.</p>

  				<p>Thank you for this article Seven and too for just being a fair and righteous person. I too feel as if Michael Jackson&#8217;s life and career was a 21st century lynching. No rope was used, but the &#8216;powers that be,&#8217; tainted Michael&#8217;s life if you will in various detrimental ways. Extremely successful, naturally multi-talented Michael represented a threat in a myriad of ways. He was uniquely talented, extremely charismatic and popular, he genuinely loved and was concerned about children (the plight of child stars, the sick, or children living in poverty), animals, our environment; most importantly, he gave his money away as if it was &#8216;water&#8217; for the causes the he believed in. Obviously, this is not sit well as it is not the American way to -NOT exploit and to put your money where your mouth is. Michael&#8217;s moral example was really a threat in too many ways. </p>
<p>Too often people do not understand, or &#8216;connect-the-dots,&#8217;that the plight of Michael Jackson&#8217;s life had very-much to do with his race. His calling card, though not as vocal as Martin Luther King. Yet his subtly-placed messages (weaved like a tapestry throughout his songs), were equivalent to those of MLK. In that -No man, no matter what his race, should be judged by the Color of his Skin, but by the Content of his Character.</p>
<p>I pray that fan&#8217;s and supporter&#8217;s of Michael Jackson comprehend his significant place in history regarding civil rights. And I pray that Michael did not live his life in vain attempting to regarding this important fact, as he so intensely and vibrantly sang into the essence of our minds and our souls: That it Does not Matter if you are Black or White. Michael Jackson brought more races together under one roof then any other black entertainer and we should all be proud of his efforts. He sang to us the &#8220;WE&#8221; are the world!</p>
<p>I only pray the MJ knew just how much that he was loved when he departed this earth. We are all on this earth for only a chosen moment, as -divine spirits having a human experience. And we are all here for a purpose, a divine appointment, if you will, (a job that we do while we are here). A human Michael exceeded expectations at his job and he served his time well during his short stint on this earth, as he attempted to-make-a-difference-to-bring-us-all-together and to help heal the world in more ways than 1. </p>
<p><strong>Michael Jackson was much more than a man of &#8220;song and dance.&#8221; Michael Jackson was a HEART that beat for the love of humanity.</strong> </p>
<p>Sincerely, I pray, may the King of Pop, rest in peace.</p>

  				<p>Diane,</p>
<p>I hope too that Michael&#8217;s fans will be able to comprehend his very significant place in history regarding civil rights. Michael wasn&#8217;t a politician or much of a political activist. He avoided political discourse and aligned himself with no particular ideology except that of LOVE for all.  But he did speak out numerous times about civil rights abuses, social injustice and racism and he generously supported many causes dedicated to alleviating these problems. He knew what was happening to him and why. It&#8217;s not that he spoke about these things that is so significant, though it is important. What is more important was the bravery with which he broke records and defied barriers for those who now follow him &#8211; the example he set. </p>
<p>In spite of the army of destruction from every facet of our society marching against him and parked outside his gates all his life, ready to pounce when he so much as moved a muscle, he persevered &#8211; and not only for &#8220;his&#8221; race, but for all races &#8211; for the World.  He was truly a hero. His place in history is indelible &#8211; not only as the greatest entertainer and humanitarian that ever lived, but also as a target of racism who similar to Rosa Parks, refused to sit at the back of the damn bus.  He did change the world &#8211; or at the very least, brought into stark daylight exactly where and how it still needs to be changed. Not that we didn&#8217;t know already, but because Michael was all of ours, and we were his, it has well and truly hit home in a way that only Michael could do it. </p>
<p>I just hope we can march forward together and fix this stinking mess. It&#8217;s one of the best ways, I think, that we can honor him and his life.</p>

  				<p>Terrific post, Seven.  I want to suggest a powerful and<br />
point on speech about this very topic.  For those who may<br />
not be aware of it, Minister Louis Farrakahn delivered<br />
a speech, The Crucifixion of Michael Jackson, that blew me<br />
away when I watched and listened.  He is a firecracker and<br />
a lightning rod like MJ was and his words affected me profoundly.<br />
Also opened my eyes to what forces were, and still are, still<br />
at work out there.</p>
<p>Thank you for your fearless thoughts and posts, Seven.</p>

  				<p>Hi Seven:</p>
<p>Could not agree more &#8211; very enlightening.</p>
<p>The Alan Simpson piece reminded me of an incident 25 years ago where I worked.  Two brothers operated the company where I worked and one day they were discussing Employment Insurance (sorry, I don&#8217;t know if you have something similar in the US).  EI provides benefits, for a period of time, for those who have lost their employment.  The brothers regarded those who needed to collect EI as &#8220;lazy bums&#8221; who did not want to work.  Several years later, the son of one of the brothers lost his job and began collecting EI.  They were talking about the son and saying how great EI was as it enabled the son to get over a rough spot in his life.  True enough.  But their perspective  totally changed when it involved &#8220;one of their own&#8221;.  Hypocrisy in action.</p>
<p>Seven, I don&#8217;t know if you have seen this &#8211; it is Michael being interviewed by Jesse Jackson, speaking of how he was coping during the trial.  Jack Johnson (&#8221;Unforgivable Blackness&#8221;) was a great inspiration to him.  What is interesting is at about :38 the text refers to Jack Johnson, but pictures are all Michael &#8211; eerily similar.  Seems not much has changed.</p>

  				<p>Seven, you hit the nail right on the head! Just Sunday I was telling my mother Michael was killed because he was black and she looked at me like I was loopy! It&#8217;s easy for someone who doesn&#8217;t care to know the facts to judge because they don&#8217;t have to do all that thinking. I know what I&#8217;m talking about. And I&#8217;m glad to find I&#8217;m not alone in my thinking.</p>

  				<p>Dear Seven,<br />
Thank you so much for your bravery in &#8220;laying it on the line.&#8221;<br />
Just Sunday, I was having a discussion about the allegations against Michael, and I said, &#8220;I have 3 words for you: Lynching, and Roman Polanski (RP).&#8221;<br />
Agree with you, Seven, MJ was lynched just as surely as if his body were hung on a tree (in fact, the latter would have been quicker and less painful than what they did to Michael). He even said, that as soon as Thriller started outselling ALL other artists (black and white), that was when they started calling him a child molester.<br />
Moreover, Michael could have just as easily hopped a chartered plane and gone somewhere from which he could not be extradited, just as RP did. (and, let&#8217;s not forget that RP was convicted! He left before he could be sentenced!)</p>
<p>Some (who continue to want to disparage Michael) will insist that he &#8220;wasn&#8217;t Black&#8221; in later life. PUHLEEZE! </p>
<p>Seven, you do such beautiful, heart-felt work here, and I truly appreciate it.<br />
Love you MORE.</p>

  				<p>Seven, I agree with every word you said. So glad to know I&#8217;m not alone in my thinking. Racism is still prevalent in our country and I see it every day. I&#8217;m white and grew up and still live in the deep south and the things I see and hear would curl your toes. I believe the Tea Party was started only because of President Obama and the fact is he is African American. These are dangerous people and they really worry me. I&#8217;m like Michael and someone&#8217;s skin color does not matter to me. To paraphrase Dr. King it&#8217;s the content of their character. Will we ever see the day when color matters to noone? I hope so.</p>

  				<p>Thank you Seven, for your bravery, powerful words and thoughts on this topic. I really appreciated them, and was very moved by this. I usually don&#8217;t comment too much, and just read, but watching the videos, reading your words, taking all of this in was very moving, it moved me to tears, and to continue the work of those who have gone before like MLK and MJ. I too believe that Michael faced the things he did in large part due to his race, and his life was cut short because of this as well. I really miss him, and wish they he could see his dream realized. Thank you and may God Bless you, Seven.</p>
<p>Hugs,<br />

  				<p>You know, I&#8217;m glad you made a point of mentioning this because like any kid, I loved MJlJ during the 80s (and all his career but the 80s was when he went stratospheric and I was old enough to understand music enough to recognise who was singing) but all through that time there was a fear in the back of my mind: I wonder which white girl they&#8217;re going to push into the limelight to say he made advances on her and try and ruin his career.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1993 and I realised that rather than not levelling any accusation of sexual impropriety they had only taken so long bringing it because they intended to use a white boy instead to summarily in effect execute him. The man was acquitted after being investigated by at least THREE law enforcement agencies (that we know about) because even over a period of TEN YEARS PLUS there&#8217;s no evidence and he&#8217;s still outright branded a criminal at every convenience. And in the same breath people say Roman Polanski is of significant cultural import and his *actual* crime was a long time ago and should be forgotten. Uhm, what?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting how they invalidate people (take all the overblown column inches devoted to Tiger Woods&#8217; infidelity &#8211; you didn&#8217;t hear as much about Sandra Bullock&#8217;s then husband): if you&#8217;re a black man they always go for aspersions on sexuality, if you&#8217;re a white woman they insinuate you&#8217;re crazy in some way, and if you&#8217;re a black woman it&#8217;s a mix of both, or something linked to aggressive behaviour.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s creepy. I mean I&#8217;ve seen so much coverage of Michael Jackson and I can see when people are afraid of being too enthusiastic about him as if the subtext is: we&#8217;re allowed to like him but we&#8217;re not allowed to show true enthusiasm or passion (i.e. LOVE him) or that would look bad. Keep in mind this is the press though and that doesn&#8217;t speak for everyone, though it does a good job of pretending to. And yet they don&#8217;t wonder why that&#8217;s so and whether it&#8217;s rooted in racism. Case in point, how many books are written about MJJ that are examinations of his art and his influences? Now how many are hardback tabloids? (You can ask any fan looking for a decent book on the man and they&#8217;ll tell you how all the good ones are out of print or don&#8217;t exist.) Now check the same for The Beatles, or David Bowie, or Sting. (Not to mention, during the coverage of MJJ after his death, it was a positive WONDER to observe the number of times article writers could bring Elvis and The aforementioned Beatles into the same sentence. Now try that in reverse: how many Elvis and Beatles articles have you seen that referenced Michael Jackson outside of his owning the rights to their music?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always found it fascinating that a white guy doing a reasonably okay job, say as a director or actor or artist is suddenly rendered a &#8216;genius&#8217; almost immediately and yet anybody else has to do ten times the work until it really can&#8217;t be argued with that they&#8217;re brilliant before people grudgingly apply the term.</p>
<p>It always riled (they don&#8217;t do it so much now) me when I&#8217;d see MJJ referenced as the &#8217;self-proclaimed King Of Pop&#8217; because I always wondered, well what else does have to to do to &#8216;prove&#8217; he&#8217;s deserving of the title? The title actually isn&#8217;t adequate enough, frankly. I also always wondered who else they thought had done as much as he had to deserve the title. And yet, as if to prove my point, it was the same title they were trying to throw on Justin Timberlake (it failed, needless to say). Even now some people try to invalidate the enormity of MJJ&#8217;s cutural contribution by calling him a &#8217;song and dance&#8217; man who wasn&#8217;t that good because he didn&#8217;t play any instruments. I can&#8217;t even start to wade through the stupidity of that when not only was MJJ&#8217;s voice his instrument, he played plenty of instruments &#8211; just not on stage. Not to mention the glaring lack of a line of worthy successors seeing as MJJ is apparently so easy to emulate.</p>
<p>Remember the &#8216;Disco Sucks&#8217; movement? Ever witness a large gathering of non-white people burning exclusively white artists records at any point? I thought it was a horribly bigoted thing to do, not to mention that it was pointed out that they didn&#8217;t just burn disco records but any records with a black face on it. And yet people still try to play off that event as just a great big prank that got over-exaggerated.</p>
<p>People refuse to actually call their racism what it is and when they&#8217;re called out in their racism  they seem to think it means going out and lynching someone &#8211; no it&#8217;s actually a structure of prejudice that maintains a collective imbalance (sometimes enough of that collective prejudice be it sustained by a manner of thinking, social policy, or a popular manner of behaviour is activated to actually kill a person but it&#8217;s the collective prejudice that is as much racism as the act because you can&#8217;t have one without the other) they either avoid dealing with it by lying about it or try to undermine what racism is by labelling it political correctness or bringing other issues of discrimnation or prejudice in and calling that racist in order to mitigate the term itself. It&#8217;s like when people say you&#8217;re &#8216;playing the race card&#8217; I always wonder: well who GAVE PEOPLE the race card to play in the first place? They didn&#8217;t give it to themselves. There&#8217;s no genetic basis for &#8216;race&#8217;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter of people seeing what they&#8217;re doing and people will often handwave. I mean, we still get fashion magazines calling &#8216;nude&#8217; a neutral and/or colour in it&#8217;s own right and not seeing how that in itself is racist. It&#8217;s not the colour of every person nude, now is it. And still hear the arguement that putting a black face on a magazine cover brings down circulation. How long has it been between Naomi Campbell being on the cover of Vogue&#8217;s september issue and Halle Berry being on this year&#8217;s? Ten years or more? Why is that? How about the difference in cover counts for Kate Moss compared to Naomi Campbell (and there are actually other black models other than Naomi but there aren&#8217;t that much in the fashion industry compared to white models &#8211; if we&#8217;re all comfortable with race and colourblind then why&#8217;s that?</p>
<p>Dealing with racism is hard because people bury it. If they have a bad memory where they said &#8211; take for example &#8211; back in the day that they wanted to marry Michael Jackson and their parents read them a riot act &#8211; they don&#8217;t examine that and question it because they&#8217;re in an environment where it isn&#8217;t done on a massive scale in fact the groupthink is to handwave and bury some more, not to mention that people often remember the associated emotions but not always the specific event. So that thinking about any black man in a mildly sexual context = shame because people will condemn. What usually happens after that is either internalisation or projection or both. But from what I can see people don&#8217;t deal with it. After all, if they did we might have actually have had the question pop up: what is it that white people find so threatening about people not like them that they have to categorise and destroy (especially when the need to categorise only comes from the need to separate, it actually doesn&#8217;t serve any other purpose)? It&#8217;s never really asked. Where does that come from exactly? If there&#8217;d been a recent history of subjugation of whites by non-whites I could understand it but as it stands it&#8217;s exactly the opposite &#8211; and still there&#8217;s&#8230; this. </p>
<p>And yet when was the last time you saw that broached in a psychology text book?</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t quite come up with a satisfactory answer as to why they found MJJ so threatening that doesn&#8217;t include racism &#8211; it&#8217;s not the only thing sure but you can be sure of one thing: when a black man is getting crucified for something connected to his sexuality particularly when that something is a total fabrication &#8211; racism is only a breath away. MJJ was doing a lot for the impoverished that no one else was. I get the impression sometimes that a lot of leaders of white radical/extreme and even white non-radical, non-extreme groups (and the people who follow them consciously or subconsciously)  believe non-whites are going to rise up and slave them. Which is such a laughable idea. They never seem to get that they&#8217;re projecting their own issues onto everyone else. That was, incidentally, an arguement I heard against the idea of voting for Obama: don&#8217;t vote for him, he&#8217;s going to put all white people in chains. Are people that consistently ruled by their own internal maze of fear and hypocrisy?</p>
<p>This issue does seem to come from white males more often then not. I even remember an article on the global grief following MJJ&#8217;s death which was basically a white male reporter wondering why black people even related to Michael Jackson, and his being surprised when he interviewed an esteemed black blues musician who said he was proud of seeing MJJ on MTV. Wasn&#8217;t it Peter King showing the true bile of his hatred when he said black people should care anything about Michael Jackson because his children were white. Which while entirely missing the point seemed to highlight that the media push that alienated MJJ from a lot of his black audience at the time was exactly that: a media push. After all I found it hard to believe that the press weren&#8217;t aware of his vitiligo. There are a few concert shots where his make up has sweated off. I always found that just plain weird that NO ONE knew figured it out. </p>
<p>I also remember being rather annoyed when it was clear that during the Bad era MJJ used umbrellas to shield from the sun (and most of his gigs, if not all, were out of the sunlight) and yet the press didn&#8217;t see fit to print pictures at this time. </p>
<p>Back to my original point, however: a very specific groupthink seems to come into play and those who notice these things have seen it all before. People denying the existence of racism are in denial, even on a law of averages is it really likely that in an age MORE motivated than ever by physical appearance race is the ONE difference that&#8217;s going to slip under the radar.</p>
<p>Ask yourself why so many decades after Bruce Lee there still isn&#8217;t an asian equivalent to Denzel Washington or Will Smith, or Halle Berry in Hollywood. Most famous asians are big in Asia FIRST before they try their luck in Hollywood and eventually leave because it never happens. Why is that? </p>
<p>Why is it that whenever you see a member of any member of an ethnic group in a TV show or film there&#8217;s only ever one of each? And if there are more they&#8217;re soon to be killed off. Actually, it&#8217;s interesting to watch the intial line up of an ensemble show and the line up when it ends, while there are exceptions (that usually prove the rule) the noticeable members of ethnic groups disappear.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like when back in the 80s if you saw a black man in a film you always knew he was going to be dead by the end of the film, if not before. That&#8217;s why Demoliton Man was such a big deal &#8211; which is a million times kind of sad because timewise that was only two minutes ago and in theory &#8211; if nobody&#8217;s being racist, that should never have been an issue, let alone happened so recently. I also remember figuring Samuel L. Jackson&#8217;s character was going to die before the end of The Long Kiss Goodnight and being rather shocked when he didn&#8217;t (apparently he had to make a point of having the script changed because that was actually what was intended to happen). I also remember people stating Somerset (Morgan Freeman) committed the final deadly sin in Seven and gone to prison, you know, instead of Mills (Brad Pitt) &#8211; when if that had happened it would have made over half of the entire film and ALL of it&#8217;s themes REDUNDANT. Why would that idea fly you ask, well Somerset is black and Mills is white. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;m going to stop now, but this link pretty much says all I&#8217;d say if I went further &#8211; shame it&#8217;s from 1993 because it would probably be a LOT longer otherwise:</p>

<p>And finally, I know a lot of people would like to skip the fact that racism was involved in the denigration of Michael Jackson and perhaps you could bring it down to money except for this one thing: why was it so easy for people to ignore Michael&#8217;s humanity &#8211; evident on many occasions &#8211; and so easy to start seeing him as a monster. The answer is that viewing some people, some groups, as non-human is a subtext hardwired into the culture. I mean really, which is more scary: black thugs in the &#8216;hood (who are most likely not venturing out of the &#8216;hood anyway or far from it), or the far reaching tendrils of multiple right-wing organisations. While I understood why some people turned on MJJ (say child abuse and you get a reflex reaction, as was the intent) what I could not understand was the degree to which they did, particularly when he&#8217;d grown up right in front of us having his every move scrutinised 24/7. He was as bright as the spotlight he was under, did people really think he &#8211; with the press maligning his ever word and move &#8211; could really cover up a long history of abuse of minors? There isn&#8217;t even any evidence of an abusive personality type in any of MJJ&#8217;s behaviour. He climbs trees, gets his security to take a bug offstage during a concert (so as NOT to kill it), looks after animals, has never been observed to have lost his temper (if he even had one), and is deeply spiritual and easily hurt. If people thought this was a facade that hid a Killer Inside Me type personality they&#8217;d be remiss to ignore the fact that there&#8217;d be EVIDENCE to base that on particularly on a man who has spent his entirely life enduring intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>Why was it so easy to believe? Because it&#8217;s about a black man&#8217;s sexuality. </p>
<p>In all honesty I swear the primary motivation for the 2005 trial was that it gave the public and media a legitimate reason to put Michael Jackson&#8217;s sexuality under a microscope &#8211; no other reason. That it might imprison and kill him, reduce him and his family to poverty while providing a cottage industry for others was just a bonus.</p>

  				<p>Oh Seven&#8230;you and I share the very same rant here.  I had hoped that before all of the allegations and horrid trama that Michael had endured, that America was truly &#8220;growing up&#8221; regarding their perceptions of the African/American race.  Michael was loved and respected BIG time back then by black and WHITE alike.  Only once &#8216;93 happened did the crap start up, and there was &#8220;Whitey&#8221; saying&#8230;&#8221;Uh huh!  See???  He&#8217;s just another (pardon this) nigger.  The only difference is that he&#8217;s a rich one.&#8221;  It broke my heart because &#8220;Whitey&#8221; at that time happened to be none other than my bible-thumping ex-husband!  I responded to him, &#8220;Then, if this is STILL what the white perception is in this country, I&#8217;m ashamed that I&#8217;m white.&#8221;  And, watching the events unfold concerning Michael for the rest of his life, horrified me.  Especially, when all I could do is sit back and watch them destroy him.  I still cry, not only for Michael and what they did to him, I cry because as much as America would like to believe that they&#8217;ve &#8220;grown up&#8221; and that there are no racial barriers, they need to look again.  It&#8217;s out of that reason, that the Media and many Americans are also hateful towards our President, Obama.  He&#8217;s been labeled a Nazi at times, amongst I&#8217;ve lost count of how many slurs have been thrown his way.  And why?  He&#8217;s black.  This knowledge not only breaks my heart, it makes me sick!  However, I will forever be proud to say that I&#8217;ve loved Michael since I was 8 years old, and my love for him will not stop.  I&#8217;m now 48.  When you love someone for 40 yrs., that in itself is magickal.  So no&#8230;I&#8217;m unwilling to lose that, and I don&#8217;t give a good damn if he was black.  He could&#8217;ve been purple, and I still would&#8217;ve loved him.  Bottom line&#8230;</p>

  				<p>Seven, I had the same thoughts all the time. There is nothing to add.<br />
I said to a friend just recently, I think these bloggers in America (or wherever?) who do this great job for Michael are like a new, modern kind of civil rights movement. I know you don&#8217;t want to make political statements, but on the other hand you cannot talk about Michael without these issues of racism, civil rights abuses, social and religious injustice, because they were also his issues, and because he had become a victim. So thank you for your courage to go into that.<br />
I just want to say, it&#8217;s important what you do in view of people like Glenn Beck and events like this &#8220;reclaiming&#8221; rally, and I support you from the other side of the ocean.</p>

  				<p>Hi Seven, thank you for the article. Michael was not a politician, but he put many messages into his songs. There are a lot of hints, you just have to discover and understand them. But many people don´t know about this or they don´t want to know ! For MJ all men are brothers, he didn´t care about the skin color.<br />
It´s a shame how they brought him finally down. They rid all of of him, even his home, where a whole army of deputies turned every thing from top to bottom and his privacy and intimacy was exploited in the trial to the public.<br />
Even after death the media fulfills their awful work with the help of so called &#8220;friends&#8221; (&#8217;<em>MJ is not the father of his children</em>&#8216; and many more ridiculus stories). They didn´t hesitate to spread his autopsy report all over the net !<br />
I don´t have to explain, how humiliating this is to refuse him a respectful treatment which they would never dare to any other person.<br />
I´m deeply ashamed of all this behaviour against a loving, caring human being.</p>

  				<p>Dear friend</p>
<p>I love your statement. KKK never left American soil.<br />
They act without the sheets covering their heads, they no longer fear being recognized, they are well backed by your laws, sadly President Obama is only a puppet in their hands.<br />
Katrina and BPOIL in New Orleans, one more example of the racist problem in America.<br />
For them MLK, Emmett Till and Michael Jackson, our sweet angel,had to be eliminated, because they had already too much power and white women where crazy about them.<br />
Dick Gregory is the man who knows.<br />
I hope I will witness the MLK dream come true in my lifetime, but I seriously doubt it.</p>

  				<p>OMG, I am not an emotional type of person but seeing these videos and those posted by commenters has me reeling.  Honestly, while following everything Michael for the past 14 months, I did not see racism per se as so very connected to his trials and tribulations.  I always believed Michael was supremely special, and his stature in the music industry led the powers to annihilate him, not so much having to do with race, as with power in the industry.  Michael to me transcended race; I was raised in NYC where everyone pretty much got along in the 60&#8217;s and I feel no differently now that I am a grandmother.  However, these videos and your blog, Seven, have opened my eyes to so much I didn&#8217;t realize before.  I&#8217;ve been following your site for months and, to me, this is the most revealing, enlightening and emotional blog you have given us.  Michael was a victim of all that Dr. King railed against in 1963 when Michael was only five years old!   Has anything changed in our country?  In our world?  America needs to WAKE UP and realize what was done to this gigantic heart and soul of a man who did God&#8217;s work on earth to awaken us to inequality and injustice, just as Dr. King and the Kennedy Brothers did all those years before.  Assassinations and &#8220;lynchings&#8221; when the establishment is threatened; we have a History, when will we make that change?</p>

  				<p>Right on MJ, Seven, and to all! MJ knew where and when to plant his feet, LEADERSHIP in motion. A leadership to benefit all. Too few people of his time understood and too few cared enough to become conscious and refute the injustice. Let&#8217;s take this as a new inspiration and a beginning to get us back into motion, make a commotion, and head us on up back atop the mountaintop and sing out &#8220;Free at Last; Thank God Almighty Free at Last&#8221;.</p>

  				<p>Thank you so much for this, I always believed Michael Jackson was a victim of racism, not only because he was black but because ignorant people believed that he had deliberately tried to turn himself into a white man, and were outraged at his audacity. I have never before seen anything even approaching the level of deliberate distortion and invective that MJ was subjected to, especially after he died, and I hope I never do again.</p>

  				<p>Perhaps what is needed here is another &#8220;March on Washington.&#8221;  We have a VOICE and we are in the MILLIONS.  What better timing could there be?  The great MLK opened the door, but then it was slammed shut.  Then a little moonwalker comes along, follows in his footsteps, and delivers message after message advocating for the rights of all colors, creeds, and gender, especially for children.  They killed him too.  If we don&#8217;t deliver his message to this dying world WHO WILL????  And, with all due respect to Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton, and others, your words for Michael&#8217;s memorial service were beautiful, but your words about him AND WHAT HE STOOD FOR need to go GLOBAL until they are HEARD.  &#8220;Can You Feel It???&#8221;</p>

  				<p>Dear Seven,<br />
Thank you so much for this interesting post. Like you, I find myself drawing thought-provoking parallels to Michael Jackson as I look at the current state of America and the world. </p>
<p>Civil rights activist and author James Baldwin had a profound understanding of Michael Jackson’s effect on America when he wrote “Here Be Dragons,” an essay from Baldwin’s The Price of the Ticket. As a gay black man and a towering intellectual, Baldwin was an unsettling presence for America in the 1960s. He raised issues on the failure of the promise of American democracy, questions of race and sexual identity and the destructive tendencies of American culture. It was more truth than America could handle. Yet like MJ, he could not be ignored or denied no matter how much scorn or hate was hurled at him. I think his words are relevant here. I was especially taken with Baldwin’s insightful diagnosis of the word “freak” and what it conjures up in people &#8211; the terrifying need for control when fixed ideas about identity, race and sex are destabilized. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Michael Jackson cacophony is fascinating in that it is not about Jackson at all. I hope he has the good sense to know it and the good fortune to snatch his life out of the jaws of a carnivorous success. He will not swiftly be forgiven for having turned so many tables, for he damn sure grabbed the brass ring, and the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo has nothing on Michael.</p>
<p>All that noise is about America, as the dishonest custodian of black life and wealth…and the burning, buried American guilt; and sex and sexual roles and sexual panic; money, success and despair…</p>
<p>Freaks are called freaks and are treated as they are treated &#8211; in the main, abominably &#8211; because they are human beings who cause to echo, deep within us, our most profound terrors and desires.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;James Baldwin (1985)</p>

  				<p>This is another great article, Thank you for sharing it with MJ fans.  It is very sad that here in America in this day and age we are still dealing with racism.  Years ago my brother had just come back from Europeon concert tour and spoke about how knd and friendly everyone was.  It was not just Germany he had been to three countries also, but the one thing he said that stayed with me all these years is that, in Europe he said he never came across any racism or bigotry the entire time he was over there.  Why?</p>
<p>I wish MJ had stayed in Ireland or Bahrain and NEVER came back to America!</p>

  				<p>Seven, I don&#8217;t know what to say to you. I am crying so hard at the moment. Every word you say is exactly what I believe. I feel so blessed that I am able to read some of what you write here. Thank you for sharing yourself with some of us who feel and believe the same as you but cannot put it into words that are so well written and amazing. The truth has hit home when we cry. Thank you L.O.V.E</p>

  				<p>I have one hopeful thing to say about all this, and I’m going to borrow the words of a great black American, Dr. Cornel West. (If you don’t know who he is, check him out; he deserves being known more widely). I’m going to quote something he said back in 2004 on Democracy Now, but I’ve heard him say it many times in much the same way. He’s talking about the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till, a black boy from Chicago who was beaten to death and dumped in a river for supposedly whistling at a white woman while visiting the Jim Crow South in 1955. His mother, Mamie Till, insisted that her son’s coffin be left open so all could see how her child was mutilated. </p>
<p>This is how West puts it: She walked to the lectern. She looked over at her baby, whose head was five times the size of his normal head. Then she looked in the eyes of America as well as the folk at south side Chicago, and she said what?—“I don’t have a minute to hate. I’m going to pursue justice for the rest of my life.” That’s a level of spiritual maturity and moral maturity that does not give up…It’s rooted in something deep. It’s rooted in an attempt to keep track of the humanity of the very people who have dehumanized you.</p>
<p>And that’s why Martin Luther King will always be remembered—because his power comes from a spiritual depth that endures beyond death. And that’s why Michael Jackson will be remembered—because despite all that was done to him, he persevered in what was right. Glenn Beck and his ilk will be footnotes in the long history of ignorance and cruelty; Jackson will be a shining light.</p>

  				<p>Thank you FF, TLS and everyone here for your thoughtful and intelligent comments. They add to this piece immeasurably, and to my hope that together, we can do what Miss Mamie Till did and MLK did and what Michael Jackson did &#8211; not hate &#8211; but pursue justice for the rest of our lives and persevere in what is right. That starts with exposing this ugliness for what it still is (unfortunately) and that&#8217;s why I wrote this piece. I had to before it chewed me up inside. It was that compelling. </p>

<p>Susan, it was the interview with Jesse Jackson you referenced where I learned about Jack Johnson and the fact that Michael looked at what was done to him and knew that he was being persecuted for the same reason &#8211; unforgivable blackness. That film (and an accompanying book) is available in PBS&#8217;s online store:  <a href="http://www.shoppbs.org/family/index.jsp?categoryId=1907699" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','www.shoppbs.org']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.shoppbs.org/family/index.jsp?categoryId=1907699</a></p>

<p>From around the world, we are gathered here as virtual witnesses to the murder of God&#8217;s latest messenger in human form, Michael Jackson, who worked tirelessly in trying to erase that curse on America.</p>

  				<p>Seven,</p>
<p>As usual you have touched upon a subject that far too often overlooked.  One that needs to be addressed over and over.  I had a supervisor who said; &#8220;If you hide your head in the sand you will get kicked in the butt&#8230;.often&#8221;</p>
<p>I am tracking Hurricane Earl as it may affect me.  I see where another oil platform is on fire.  There is a comment here which says; &#8220;If Obrother wasn&#8217;t in office this wouldn&#8217;t be happening, vote for _____ 2010&#8243; If that is not the most ignorant thing I&#8217;ve heard recently.  Hopefully this person does not have children, is not in a position to influence children thinking.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>FF made a comment to the effect how could the Media not know Michael had Vitiligo.  In August Diane Sawyer interviewed a reportedly imminent Dermatologist who verified Michael&#8217;s condition.  Sawyer says&#8230;.so it SEEMS..Jackson really did have Vitiligo!   What the hell do you mean&#8230;..seems.  As if there is any question about it, as if there wasn&#8217;t a physician who discussed this during the 2005 trial, who reported Michael first sought treatment to restore his natural color.  </p>
<p>The interjection of the Beatles and Elvis and Paul McCartney into stories about Michael, but not in reverse is something even music buffs who aren&#8217;t fans of Michael&#8217;s music have noticed.  Billboard’s attributing Michael&#8217;s most popular song as SAY, SAY, SAY was so patently insulting they may as well came out and said; &#8220;we will not give Jackson credit for anything&#8221;   His finances are discussed as if he was a middle income worker rather than a millionaire involved in multiple business with several hundred workers having some deal turn out well and some not, like any other business man.  Discussions which ignored that after the 93 civil suit settlement his time in court tripled and the courts were not all that fair in their judgments.  </p>
<p>Why is it not one journalist except Charles Thomson mentioned that Michael registered a song he named &#8220;TII&#8221; 3 years prior to he and Anka working on a song which is later reported as stolen from Anka as if he were the sole writer?  Why were there no investigations comparing the music to see if Anka should have received 50% of the CD&#8217;s revenue just a rush to call MJ a theft?  You can be sure if it had been the other way around Michael would still be in court today. What if Willie Nelson had gotten the Catalog and used it to pay off his IRS debt(s) would there still be this nasty overbearing attitude towards the owner of the catalog? (no disrespect  to Mr. Nelson)</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Michael had been white?  There are female fans that had to leave because they were forced to choose between Fanship of Michael and family, and friends.  Simmons is ok Michael not. There are females who are insulted and verbally assaulted because they enjoy the physical look of him and are condemned much in the manner of the old southern white female who associated with a black man.</p>
<p>Saying Michael looked freakish was meant to stop woman from desiring him and when that did not work there was an attempt to use most of society&#8217;s homophobia by labeling him Gay.  Since neither assertion was turning us away the two were combined and with his desire to be with the young, those who were not looking for anything but love and a common male preference to hang out with males to create an image of the most horrible of individuals, a molester of young boys.  Because our society sees a male molesting a boy worse than a girl it was ensured that no pictures of Michael playing with, riding on Disney rides or being affection with a little girl was published.  It wasn’t until June this year I learned the Kardashian girls played at Neverland and that Kim had her 14Th Birthday party there </p>
<p>For those who have read MJ’s FBI file and/or the 1993 report you get the sense of what was running thru the heads of the men involved.  The FBI Agent a man who is suppose to be a trained investigator possessing analytical skill went as far as to inject his own prejudices into the report when he referred to Bubbles twice or the consideration to using the Man Act. </p>
<p>A racial and sexual stereotyping created by men borne of their own ignorance, jealousies and fears deployed as a weapon to destroy one Man.</p>

  				<p>Gosh, where do i begin?!<br />
i tried to post the last 2 nights, late and spent so long i fell asleep both times before i finished &#8211; am very tired at the moment. but i had so much wanted to say. i&#8217;m not going to say it all now as much has been said by others in some amazing posts<br />
Thanks Seven for bringing up this issue. i absolutely agree, with everything you and everyone else has said. i have long believed racism has been and still is at the bottom of Michael&#8217;s bad treatment and it cuts at my heart and chest till it feels physical, it makes me want to scream.</p>
<p>Michael was and is a phenomenal force in breaking down racial barriers and drawing people together in a way i cannot think anyone else has ever done, because of his musical and creative talent and the way he used it. Everything he did and said was motivated by wanting to do this, along with wanting to address other world problems, and it is outrageous that so many accused him of denying his race. He was a black man through and through and was immensely proud of that. What is also stunning is that God gave him a skin condition that brought a bigger brighter spotlight on the entire issue. this spotlight forces discussion of race and colour and reveals racism where it may have been hidden because as i think i said somehwere else here the very obsession of people who go on and on about his change in colour blah blah blah, is itself racism by the continued obsession with it. if skin colour doesn&#8217;t matter why focus on it? just let it go and enjoy the man.<br />
However as you Seven and others have said so eloquently, the effect of Michael was a threat to the establishment and those who want to maintain white power. so as soon as they recognised what was happening &#8211; and i didn&#8217;t realise but am not surprised that this started in 70&#8217;s, &#8211; they began to tear down the man who stepped out of his place and dared to believe he could be as good as and better than a white musician. How evil and yet also how pathetic and stupid. and yet also how tragic not only personally for Michael, how tragic for the world that instead of further developing his art and creative gifts to us, he had to spend so much time and energy tied up fighting attacks and legal problems. my mind cannot imagine what we have missed out on as a result and my heart aches and screams for the pain he endured.</p>
<p>there are so many people who can testify that their lives and thoughts about race were influenced by the J5 and Michael in particular. i was about 7 or 8 when i was captivated, that was in 1971/2 when i first saw them on tv. i remember sitting on the floor in front of the tv mesmerised by the energy, the sound, Michael&#8217;s eyes and his LIFE. he was a kid but i was littler and to me he was a boy to look up to and &#8216;fancy&#8217; (not sexually, i didn&#8217;t know about that at that age), he was a bright star. i am white, brought up in a middle class family in a village in kent, outside London. there were no black people where i lived, my experience at that time did not inlude meeting any black people. there was not any prejudice in this it was just circumstances. i would have seen other black people on tv but i don&#8217;t really remember, they would not have been young like J5 and wouldn&#8217;t have made an impact on me at that age, so i can say really that Michael and his brothers was my first encounter with people who were not white. as a child of 7 of course i could see they were a different race to me but as a child there was no concept of this as a barrier, it didn&#8217;t matter, i just accepted it and i loved and admired them. as a young teenager later in 70&#8217;s with Michael&#8217;s face looking down at me from my bedroom wall, i started to become aware of racism in the world and i started to develop a strong sense of justice and injustice, about race but also about other social issues, which has only strengthened over the years. i don&#8217;t know if i would have become like that anyway, how can i know, but i do think that the Michael effect at an early age was key.<br />
multiply that simple account millions of times and it is possible to see just how Michael and J5 have affected world history, without even taking Michael&#8217;s other words and humanitarian actions into account.</p>
<p>something i nearly posted on another thread here but didn&#8217;t cos it didn&#8217;t fit and i didn&#8217;t want to taint the loveliness of that thread, so i am SO glad you have posted this, is this:</p>
<p>1993 &#8211; Michael began the year wanting to be more interactive with the media and world and show the world more of himself as a person &#8211; so he went on Oprah and spoke honestly and compellingly about himself and in the process explained his love for children. then a few months later lo and behold he is accused of child molestation.<br />
1995 ? &#8211; Michael and LMP wanted to straighten out misconceptions and rumours about their marriage and the settlement &#8211; so they did the Diane Sawyer interview &#8211; then he is sued for daring to speak about his innocence!<br />
2002 &#8211; 3 &#8211; Michael again wanted to straighten out misperceptions of himself and improve his image so he did the LWMJ thing &#8211; then a few months later he is again accused of child molestation.</p>
<p>the accusations only seem to come as a response to him daring to reach out to the world and present the truth about himself and what he believes in. if he had been truly doing these things why do they not come at any other time? apart from the fact they were lies of course, they didn&#8217;t come because he was appearing to put up with the bashing and bullying, as soon as he raised his head above the parapet to speak out and publicly stand up for himself, he had to be pushed firmly down again. like he was being told &#8217;shut up or we&#8217;ll get you&#8217;.<br />
could this have happened without being deliberately orchestrated? i don&#8217;t believe so. </p>
<p>I think FF made some very good points and i particularly want to agree with the last paragraph, Michael grew up under our eyes and was intensely scrutinised constantly &#8211; yet there is no evidence he was anything but very kind, and anti any sort of violence and violation of innocence and rights &#8211; so why in the world would anyone believe he was capable of the actions he was accused of when there is no evidence to suggest it? there is no logical explanation, only the evil explanation that it was all orchestrated and was done from racist motives.</p>
<p>the other important factor &#8211; the pictures published of him in tabloids that accompany the wacko and freak headlines. pictures that so many times do not actually match what he looked like at all. one case in point i have wanted to ask about for ages &#8211; that mugshot photo. is that real? it just doesn&#8217;t look like Michael. how is it similar to the photo on your &#8216;lost&#8217; post which was taken around the same time, maybe a year later.(thats why i asked when it was taken). and its not similar to how he looked in LWMJ a year earlier. is there another picture taken in 2003 around the time he handed himself in to police and was horrifically and SO needlessly handcuffed to make a point &#8216;we&#8217;ve got him&#8217;? i will carry on looking for one. but the saying goes &#8216;pictures are worth a thousand words&#8217; and they deliberately avoid the many many good pictures of him and publish manipulated ones and &#8216;bad hair day&#8217; ones to make people think he must be weird. which is SO strange when he was actually so beautiful at all stages in his life and there are so many other pictures to choose from!<br />
but not strange if you realise it was all deliberate to destroy him. and what other reason could there possibly have been.</p>

<p>Just a slight correction:  that billboard countdown of MJ&#8217;s top 50 hits was based on a mathematical formula that calculated the weighted average of how much time each song spent in the top 100 songs.  The higher the song charted, the more points it earned.  &#8220;Say, Say, Say&#8221; earned a few more points because it spent more time in the top 20 and 40 than &#8220;Billie Jean&#8221;.  Trust me, when I first saw the list, my eyes popped out of my head because I couldn&#8217;t comprehend how &#8220;Say, Say, Say&#8221; could possibly top &#8220;Bille Jean&#8221;, but once I read the rules I understood. I copied below the rules of how the points were determined:</p>
<p>How This Chart Was Created<br />
The ranking of Michael Jackson&#8217;s top 50 Billboard hits is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100. Songs are ranked based on an inverse point system, with weeks at No. 1 earning the greatest value and weeks at No. 100 earning the least. For example, while &#8220;Billie Jean&#8221; spent one more week at No. 1 and two more weeks on the chart than &#8220;Say Say Say,&#8221; Jackson&#8217;s collaboration with Paul McCartney spent more weeks in the top 10 (13-11), the top 20 (16-12) and more weeks in the top 40 (18-17) than &#8220;Jean&#8221; did.</p>
<p>Prior to the Hot 100&#8217;s implementation in 1991 of enhanced radio and sales information from Nielsen BDS and Nielsen SoundScan, songs had shorter reigns at No. 1 and shorter chart lives. To ensure equitable representation of the biggest hits from Michael Jackson&#8217;s entire recording career, earlier time frames were each weighted to account for the difference between turnover rates from those decades and the turnover rates that have occurred since the advent of Nielsen Music data.</p>

  				<p>ANOTHER TRAGIC STORY&#8230;</p>
<p>Alternate Name &#8211; born: Sam Cook<br />
Born: 1 &#8211; 21 &#8211; 1931 in Clarksdale, MS<br />
Died: 12 &#8211; 11 &#8211; 1964 in Los Angeles, CA </p>
<p>THE STORY<br />
From: T. White&#8217;s Rock Lives: Profiles and Interviews, 1990, Henry Holt<br />
According to the principals involved, Cooke had picked up a Eurasian girl named Elisa Boyer at a bar on the evening of December 10, 1964,and she had accepted his Offer of a ride home. Instead he drove them to a motel on South Figueroa in Los Angeles and registered as &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Cooke.&#8221; Boyer told police that she insisted he take her home, but that Cooke refused and forced her into the motel room. She testified that he &#8220;began to rip my clothes off.&#8221; When Cooke went into the bath-room, she fled on foot with her clothes and most of Cooke&#8217;s. Clad only in a sports jacket and his shoes, he pursued her. The manager of the motel, Mrs. Bertha Lee Franklin, told police that Cooke kicked in the door of her apartment and accused her of harboring the girl (who was actually in a nearby telephone booth, calling the police). Franklin testified that Cooke struck her twice with his fist. She responded by producing a .22 caliber pistol and firing three shots; one hit Cooke in the chest.<br />
Mortally wounded, he continued to charge her, she said, so she bludgeoned him with a stick. When the police arrived, they found him dead on the floor.<br />
His wife, Barbara, became hysterical when police notified her at their Hollywood home; with her were two of their children, a third child having drowned in their swimming pool that summer.<br />
Thousands of anguished fans stormed the main chapel at the A, R. Leak Funeral Home at 7838 Cottage Grove in Chicago during the public wake, breaking glass and splintering wood. One woman screamed, &#8220;Please, let me in! I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this in my life!&#8221;<br />
Shortly before Cooke&#8217;s death, he had been a guest vocalist with the Soul Stirrers at an anniversary concert in Chicago. When he took the microphone to raise his pure, sweet voice in Stirrers standards like &#8220;Jesus Wash Away My Troubles&#8221; and &#8220;Nearer to Thee,&#8221; the crowd fell silent and then began to castigate him. &#8220;Get that blues singer down!&#8221; they yelled angrily. &#8220;This is a Christian program! Get that no- good so-and-so down!&#8221;<br />
Cooke walked off the stage in tears. </p>
<p>A note from David Cook, Jr., the son of Sam Cooke&#8217;s younger brother David:<br />
&#8220;As far as the story behind his death, the family has information that leads us to believe a set-up and cover-up were involved. The media is not always correct.&#8221; ~David Cook, Jr. 4-11-99</p>

  				<p>&#8230;More on the Sam Cook case: </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Boyer&#8217;s story is the only account of what happened between the two that night; however, her story has long been called into question. Inconsistencies between her version of events and details reported by other witnesses, as well as circumstantial evidence (e.g., cash that Cooke was reportedly carrying was never recovered, and Boyer was soon after arrested for prostitution),[14] invited speculation that Boyer may have gone willingly to the motel with Cooke, then slipped out of the room with Cooke&#8217;s clothing in order to rob him, rather than to escape an attempted rape.[6][13]</p>
<p><strong>Such questions were ultimately deemed beyond the scope of the inquest. . .</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;now doesn&#8217;t the above sound familiar?  This is the same way authorities have narrowed their focus in the case of Michael&#8217;s murder when there are so many truly involved in events leading to his death if not his murder itself. They do this when they are not interested in all the facts of the case. They slam the door in the face of Justice because they decided it doesn&#8217;t matter when it damn well does. Just because they say it&#8217;s irrelevant &#8211; doesn&#8217;t mean it is.</p>

  				<p>Thanks, Jane, for remembering Sam Cooke. I think of him often when I think of MJ. And I worry about the fact that justice was never obtained for the man who gave us &#8220;Change Gonna Come&#8221; (even though nearly everyone plays the Otis Redding cover of it, Cooke&#8217;s own is BEAUTIFUL!). </p>
<p>The wikipedia entry cited by Seven also contains this:&#8221;<em>,,,singer Etta James claimed that she viewed Cooke&#8217;s body in the funeral home and that the injuries she observed were well beyond what could be explained by the official account&#8230;James described Cooke as having been so badly beaten that his head was nearly separated from his shoulders, his hands were broken and crushed, and his nose mangled</em>.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sickened and heartbroken that Cooke&#8217;s brutal murder isn&#8217;t worth solving, and worried that MJ will not receive justice either. But there are legions fighting for Jackson right now and I don&#8217;t see it going away. And there are the children; both Paris and Prince look strong to me. I have a vision of Paris, with her glasses on, digging up a truth that can&#8217;t be denied. I also have a vision of Sony&#8217;s death. I&#8217;m going to hold to those visions and in the meantime do whatever I can to help make them happen.</p>
<p>I just went back to wiki to check my facts and found this out about Cooke&#8217;s version of the song: <em>&#8220;Despite its acclaim, legal troubles have haunted the single since its release. A dispute between Cooke&#8217;s music publisher, ABKCO, and record company, RCA Records, made the recording unavailable for much of the four decades since its release.</em>&#8221; What can stop this Greed Monster? Maybe us.</p>

  				<p>TLS,</p>
<p>Ah yes. I remember reading that bit about how mangled Cooke&#8217;s body was.  </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it interesting the similarities between these other black luminaries and Michael &#8211; the similar injustices perpetrated on them in life, and the similar disinterest in justice and in properly rectifying their legacies upon their deaths?</p>

  				<p>What&#8217;s fascinating about all of these accounts is that it&#8217;s always the same: separate the successful black man from his money, sanity, life, varying combinations, or all three.</p>
<p>As for the Billboard calculation, it&#8217;s based on airplay in part &#8211; there&#8217;s the consideration that a duet with an ex-Beatle may have been played for on stations that might have been initially reluctant. But that too is part of the point: it&#8217;s interesting how &#8211; no matter what the data is &#8211; Michael is never given his due and sole credit, it&#8217;s either denied him and/or shared/given to someone else, the implication being it&#8217;s *due* to someone else. His multitude of achievements are then minimised and/or denigrated. It&#8217;s like all the recaps on Thriller seem to focus on Landis&#8217; video, as if it wasn&#8217;t Michael who asked for his participation and not the other way around.</p>
<p>It will continue to be the same too&#8230; because it apparently seems to work. All you have to do is suggest that a black man is inherently untrustworthy and implicate his sexuality somehow and some people seem to have a reflex reaction that bypasses all critical faculties. And then nobody questions why the majority of all serial killers are white. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s because they have to kill several people before some will accept that they killed ANYBODY. </p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t known the full story about Cooke, I&#8217;d just known he died young. How come all of the prodigious black talent is destroyed this way, unless it serves a particular agenda? Again because until now it&#8217;s been working and nobody&#8217;s questioned it. Even consider the way that Michael&#8217;s fans are always painted as &#8216;crazy&#8217;. I&#8217;d say if there was a reason for a fandom to go crazy it&#8217;s MJJ fans with all they&#8217;ve had thrown at them and dismissed, and yet for the most part I find them incredibly well informed.</p>
<p>Thanks Seven, for this site.</p>

  				<p>Thank you so much Seven, I fully agree with your thoughts about Michael&#8217;s lynching .. This is the most HORRIBLE story I have ever heard those last years about racism !<br />
I really hope that Justice will restore the PRIDE back into the name: MICHAEL JACKSON<br />
Michael is definitely one of the greatest HUMAN BEINGS on earth<br />
LOVE YOU MICHAEL FOREVER &#8230;</p>
<p>Love from so far away France<br />

  				<p>All of the posts were incredibly honest and the pain that was so unjustly dumped on Michael breaks my heart so deeply.  I just wish all of this was AIRED ON MAINSTREAM TV SO EVERYBODY, NOT JUST MJ FANS COULD HEAR IT.  I am so concerned that justice will not be served in the upcoming trial of Dr.(?) Conrad Murray.  There are so many others who have contributed to the pain and destruction of this unique and amazing soul that it is unbelievable.  What must we do to vindicate and bring justice to our sweet angel?  I have so little confidence in what lies ahead.  May God help us all and may our sweet, beautiful Michael rest in peace and enjoy heaven with our Creator for all eternity.</p>

  				<p>Seven, another fabulous post.  I have to agree with you on all counts in that Michael was mocked, vilified and ridiculed beyond belief, and for many years, relentlessly.  However, I do not believe that this always had a connection with racism.  Indeed, there are racists out there who will inevitably have jumped on the media-manipulation bandwagon simply because he was black, but the issue is not really about racism and although Michael spoke through his songs, his charitable giving and in person about racism, he didn&#8217;t play the race card, because he knew that the issue went a lot deeper than that. Much of the media who vilified Michael are also extremely anti racism, so much so that they will vilify and expose anyone and everyone who has even a remote connection to something deemed as racist.  Therefore, this cannot be the issue underlying much of the inhumane treatment dished out against Michael.  I personally believe that it was much more about good vs evil.  If you look at many artists in the music industry today, many start out with good intentions, moral values, decency.  And they soon become tainted with a different brush.  If they do not follow the crowd and go with the image that &#8217;sells&#8217; (ie. lust, power, greed, promiscuity etc) then they are ridiculed and condemned, as Michael was throughout his life.  Many people do not like to see the good in others.  It makes them feel bad. Michael&#8217;s light shone out clear and bright, and therefore it attracted the darkness.  He was not willing to bow to the industry, and therefore, the industry, and media who refused to see his goodness, endeavoured to destroy him.</p>
