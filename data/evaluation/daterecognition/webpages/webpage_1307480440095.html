<p>A strain gauge  is a thin strip of metal that is used in measuring of mechanical loads  by changing its resistance when subjected to stretching or compressive  stresses. Bridge circuits are used in these gauges in order to achieve  precise measurements of resistance changes and also compensate the  resistance variations due to temperature changes.They have wide uses in  engineering profession.</p>
<p>Their operation depends entirely on their  physical property of electrical conductance. Electrical conductance on  the other hand is a factor of electrical conductivity mostly due to the  material property and the geometry of conductor. It is relevant to note  that stretching and narrowing conductors within their elastic limit  increases their electrical resistance end to end while compressing them  makes them thicker hence decreasing their electrical resistance.</p>
<p>As  an instrument it is commonly used in measuring of mechanical stresses  generated by machines in mechanical engineering applications, research  and development. A typical application area of this sensor is in the  manufacture of pressure sensors where components like silicon, poly  silicon, metal film, bonded foil and metal film are used.</p>
<p>Temperature  variation and changes is the biggest challenge faced in manufacture and  application of these gauges. The metal strip narrow thickness will  expand thermally due to variations in temperatures and this is always  interpreted as a strain by the transducer. Thermal expansion of the  strips will alter the strip resistance and hence affecting the  preciseness of the measurement. To compensate this challenges caused by  temperature variations specially made metal alloys are used which self  compensate the changes. The other method of countering the temperature  variation is by use of Wheatstone bridge having for gauges.</p>
<p>During  the construction of this transducer an optimum combination of all  affecting factors is paramount. A well constructed transducer should  have optimum sensitivity to ensure measurement and detection of even  small instances of stresses. It has to be free from temperature effects  and other environmental changes. Good linearity and stability together  with robustness are also relevant features of a good fabricated gauge.</p>
<p>The  size and mass of the sensor should be convenient and preferably small  for easy portability. The dynamic nature of the engineering profession  application requires measurement tolls that can be applied amply in both  static and dynamic measurements. The cost of production and the prices  in shop shelves should also be convenient.</p>
<p>Application of <a href="http://www.disensors.com/products.aspx?id=35">strain  gauges</a> can be well discussed if divided into their specific areas of  use. These transducers can tailor made to measure stresses in steel or  stresses in concrete. Applications in measuring pressure in steel  include monitoring stresses in the structural steel members of  buildings, bridges and supports during and after completion of civil  engineering works. They are also used in monitoring tresses in strutting  systems foe deep excavations. Application in concrete includes  measuring strains in reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>They can be purchased in  a whole complete set with all the elements and bridge resistors in one  encasing. They are very useful in engineering fraternity for they help  detection of stresses that are of vast importance to engineers. <a href="http://www.disensors.com/products.aspx?id=16"><label id="2820">Accelerometer</label></a></p>

			<p>Here are useful ideas about how to use Internet Banking on Your Mobile phone. The cell phone is not just for making phone calls. In today&#8217;s digital age, many digital technologies have been combined into the cell phone. The cell phone is used for surfing the web, email, making videos and taking photographs. A huge market has grown for phone applications. There is an &#8220;app&#8221; for almost anything you can think of.</p>
<p>Most banks now have <a href="http://www.scotiabank.com/tt/cda/index/0,,LIDen,00.html">bank online</a>. In fact, financial institutions encourage their customers to bank online. It is more cost effective to have customers do their transactions electronically. The financial institutions can pass on these savings in reduced fees and charges. Customers love paying bills online. Most customers now prefer taking care of their bank business on the web. There cell phone is the perfect device for doing this. Banks have phone apps available for free to their customers.</p>
<p>Soon you will be able to use a cell phone as a <a href="http://www.scotiabank.com/vi/cda/content/0,1679,CCDvi_CID1005_LIDen_SID56_YID13,00.html">credit card</a>. This system is being tested in limited markets, but it will be common in the near future. Any business that accepts a credit card will process the cell phone which will have the magnetic strip that is swiped. Even the venerable credit card will be merged into the functionality of the ordinary humble cell phone.</p>
<p>It is getting very close to that point where it will be a rare occasion when you have to enter a physical bank. Just about all financial transactions can be carried out digitally over the web using a cell phone or some other similar gadget. People will no longer understand what you are talking about if you say &#8220;I have to run to the bank&#8221;.</p>
<p>Many people already have their regular monthly bills automatically paid via electronic payments. It is now rare to see a hard copy paper monthly statement or bill. Most people receive their statements and other paper work digitally. They get notices telling them that documents are waiting for them to be reviewed via email. With only one or two digital electronic tools you will have everything you need to survive comfortably in this digital world.</p>
<p>The cellphone has become one of the most important devices we use in life. It has now replaced the photo and video camera. More people connect on the popular social networking websites through their cellphones than via personal computers. Text messages are a dominant form of communication among young people now. There are many apps to help in all areas of life in addition to managing personal finances.</p>
<p>Tax apps now make it possible to file taxes using the cell phone. You can fill out the forms, apply for a refund, and specify the bank account where the refund will be directly deposit electronically. You can do that just using a phone. Who would have thought something like this was even possible ten years ago.</p>
<p>Internet banking on your mobile phone is one of the best examples of how digital technology has made our lives better. This is a technology that can benefit anyone. It makes life easier and it is more fun. The cell phone has become among the important tools of modern civilization.</p>

<p>Engineers are  essential for the economic success and continuing progress of our  society. Engineering is a great career for some, perhaps you should  consider it. They work on a lot of interesting stuff. On the downside,  it can be difficult to break into the field, and it definitely isn&#8217;t a  good choice for everyone. Here&#8217;s some of the basic facts.</p>
<p>Engineers  do many different kinds of things. In this article I&#8217;m mostly talking  about the designing and building kind, that might design a file server  or build an electrical transmission line. Some primarily maintain  pipelines or operate computer networks, or similar work. These are  clearly important, but not our focus here.</p>
<p>Engineering includes  many fields of specialization. Those who specialize in mechanics may  design elevators or other complex machines. Electrical engineers may  design computers and power systems. You can guess what nuclear ones do.  I&#8217;m not going to try for a complete list, there are too many for that!</p>
<p>Are  you curious about how machines are put together? Can you do complicated  math work? Do you like science? If so, maybe you should consider  engineering. It is sometimes called applied science. Technologist is  another common label for practitioners of this field.</p>
<p>You will  need to spend some time in school before you can be an engineer. There  is a lot of material that you would need to learn. Bachelor&#8217;s degrees  are almost always needed, and master&#8217;s degrees are often very useful to  have, if not necessary.</p>
<p>Before the candidate can begin work, he or  she may need to get licensed or credentialed. In many cases, they must  pass a comprehensive exam on their field as part of this. Different  specializations have different rules. To make matters worse, the rules  are different in different countries, and sometimes even in different  states of the United States.</p>
<p>New engineers generally start on  basic assignments. They are often carefully monitored by others with  more experience. As they learn and establish their reputations, they  will move on to more challenging work. Eventually they will have to  choose between alternative development directions.</p>
<p>Some will  become engineering managers. This obviously requires people skills as  well as technical skills. This kind of manager usually becomes less  involved in the technology and more involved in helping others work with  it.</p>
<p>Project management is another possible path. Project managers  are not mainly managers of people, though the title makes it sound that  way. They are charged with insuring that large technical projects are  successful. Project managers need to know the technology. They also need  to know how to organize and keep track of complex efforts.</p>
<p>Even  though many engineers start out working for larger firms, it is common  for them to branch out after awhile. Some may work independently. Others  will start their own new firms.</p>
<p>Many will continue to focus on  learning the technology and keeping up to date. This is essential in  fields where lots of progress is happening; letting one&#8217;s skills become  obsolete is a real risk in such areas.</p>
<p>We need to have lots of  talented engineers to make progress and keep up with the competition.  Innovation is often essential for economic growth. Engineers are among  the key innovators in modern society.</p>

<p>Engineers have  conflicting images. Some see them as nerds or geeks. Others see them as  solvers of some of our most important problems. They do get to work on  some cool stuff, but they do other things that might be considered  boring. Do you think you would like to be one? It&#8217;s not that easy, but  we need a lot of them. Here&#8217;s the story in brief.</p>
<p>Lots of rather  different kinds of work are referred to as engineering. Sometimes they  design and build things, like airplanes or air conditioners. This is the  kind that I&#8217;m mainly talking about here. They may also do operate and  do maintenance on bridges and water treatment plants and other complex  systems.</p>
<p>An engineer&#8217;s title usually describes the kind of system  he or she works on. Electrical engineers design all kinds of electrical  systems. Mechanical ones design turbines and other complex machines.  What kind works on nuclear reactors? You can probably figure that one  out. And so on, I can&#8217;t list all the many different kinds.</p>
<p>If you  are curious about how things work, you might make a good engineer. You  would also need significant mathematical talent and training. Science  education is important too. Applied science is another term for  engineering. Various titles that include some form of the word  technology may also be applicable.</p>
<p>Most engineering specialties  require at least a bachelor&#8217;s degree. Sometimes a masters degree is  important too. There is a lot of training and education required before  useful work can begin.</p>
<p>A license or credential is often required  before the candidate can actually begin practice. In some cases there is  a comprehensive exam on the specific field that the candidate must take  and pass. Different fields have different rules for this. To make  things more complex, countries generally have their own unique licensing  or credentialing processes. Even different states within the United  States may have their own rules.</p>
<p>When starting out, new engineers  usually work on basic assignments under close supervision from  experienced peers. Over time, they will work more independently on more  challenging jobs. After a few years they will commonly select a more  specialized career branch.</p>
<p>Engineering management is one possible  option. As with other kinds of people management, this requires both the  ability to provide effective leadership and training in management  skills. A good background in technical work is also important. The  managing engineer, like most managers, mainly helps the people doing the  technical work, rather than actually doing it.</p>
<p>Project management  is also important in many fields. The title can be confusing. Project  managers don&#8217;t manage people, they manage projects. That is, they are  responsible for the successful execution of large, challenging projects.  Organizational abilities are very important for project managers. They  need to understand the technology too.</p>
<p>Some engineers like to work  as independent consultants. Others start their own firms. In most  cases, they will begin by working for larger existing engineering  companies and move on after getting some experience.</p>
<p>Some may  decide to commit themselves to always being the most knowledgeable in  their fields. Keeping up with developing technology can be a full time  job, but it is very important for at least some people to work on this.</p>
<p>It  is very important for our society to have a good supply of dedicated  engineers. Keeping up in the modern competitive world requires constant  development of new technologies and products. We need engineers to be  able to do this.</p>

<p>Have you ever  considered becoming an engineer? It can be a very rewarding career.  Engineers get to work on a lot of really neat things. It&#8217;s not an easy  field to get into. It certainly isn&#8217;t the thing for everyone. Let&#8217;s take  a look at some of the basics.</p>
<p>The title engineer covers many  different kinds of work. I&#8217;m going to be focusing here on the kind of  engineer that designs and builds things such as engines and computers.  In other cases they may maintain and operate things like power plants  and ships.</p>
<p>Many different kinds of engineers design and build  things. Mechanical ones work on engines and other devices that involve  complex mechanics. For electrical, they design electrical generation and  transmission systems, and devices that use electricity. Nuclear ones  design nuclear reactors and their supporting systems. And so on, there&#8217;s  not enough room here to cover all of the different kinds of work  spanned by this occupation.</p>
<p>Successful engineers are usually  curious about how things work. They need to be able to do fairly complex  mathematics. A good understanding of science is also important. This  occupation is sometimes referred to as applied science; it is closely  related to the development of new technologies.</p>
<p>The aspiring  engineer needs to be able to go to school for years to acquire the level  of training expected. Most specializations require at least a  bachelor&#8217;s degree, and in many a masters degree provides a very helpful  additional level of education.</p>
<p>In many areas of engineering the  candidate must obtain some sort of license or credential before he or  she can actually begin their practice. This may include taking a  comprehensive examination on the candidate&#8217;s knowledge of their field.  This is a very complex subject; different fields have different rules.  Also, different countries, and even different states, have their own  unique rules for licensing or otherwise credentialing.</p>
<p>Beginning  engineers usually start out by working on simple projects under the  supervision of more experienced coworkers. As they acquire more  experience, they will be given more and more complex assignments.  Eventually they will choose one of several possible career paths.</p>
<p>One  possible career is to go into engineering management. This path  requires not only training and experience with technical work, but also  skills and training in working with people. As with other kinds of  management, the managing engineer mostly helps other people do the  actual work, rather than doing it himself or herself.</p>
<p>Another path  is project management, which is quite different from engineering  management. Instead of primarily managing people, a project manager is  assigned responsibility for ensuring that complex projects are  successfully implemented. Project management requires excellent  organizational skills as well as a good technical background.</p>
<p>It  is common for engineers to begin their careers working for larger  engineering firms, and branch out on their own after acquiring some  experience. They may work independently or start their own firms.</p>
<p>Others  may choose to continue to develop their technical expertise. There is  always a need for people who are up to date on the latest findings and  technologies. Keeping up to date can be a full time job.</p>
<p>Engineers  make very important contributions to our society. Continued economic  growth is dependent on creative and innovative development of new  products and services. Engineers are often key contributors to this kind  of innovation.</p>
