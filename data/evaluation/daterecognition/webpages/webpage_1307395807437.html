                                                      <p>Nurtured by the pure water that is the source of life, fragrant flowers bloom in abundance, and the people face each day with hopeful smiles. </p>
                                                      <p>But where there is light, darkness also lurks. </p>
                                                      <p>As noted in my earlier reports, I must solve the mystery of this �darkness of the heart.� This paradise depends on it. </p>
                                                      <p>I shall perform an experiment to probe the depths of a person's heart. One of my own apprentices, Xehanort, has volunteered to be a subject. </p>
                                                      <p>The young man has served me ever since I nursed him back from death's door some years ago. </p>
                                                      <p>He had lost all his memories at the time, but later showed remarkable intellectual curiosity and readily absorbed my teachings, gaining deep wisdom. Any mental immaturity is surely due to his young age. </p>

                                                      <p>As soon as I found out, I called my apprentices together and ordered them not only to cease their studies, but to destroy the results of their research thus far. </p>
                                                      <p>What on earth was happening within the hearts of my six beloved apprentices? While pursuing the mystery of the darkness of the heart, could they themselves have strayed into its depths? </p>

                                                      <p>He was very knowledgeable on many topics, and we deepened our friendship as we conversed companionably. </p>
                                                      <p>Upon his advice, I decided to review the data obtained at my basement lab. </p>
                                                      <p>That is when I discovered the �Ansem Reports.� </p>

                                                      <p>These synthetic Heartless bore insignias and were called �Emblems.� </p>
                                                      <p>Pureblood or Emblem, these heartless act only to fulfill their instinctive needs. They single-mindedly detect hearts and swarm around them. </p>
                                                      <p>A human's commands would be ineffective: The Heartless would easily steal the human's heart and use it to increase their own ranks. </p>
                                                      <p>But what if an even stronger Heartless was giving the orders? </p>

                                                      <p>Furthermore, wouldn't he be planning to make use of the creatures' instincts? If the heart-seeking Heartless have their sights set on a larger, more powerful heart, their ultimate goal is crystal-clear. </p>
                                                      <p>The largest heart in existence�the heart of the world. </p>
                                                    <p>This is all conjecture, but it would seem he is utilizing the Heartless in his search for a path leading to the heart of the world. </p></td>

                                                      <p>The other five have disappeared. Have they become Heartless, like Xehanort? </p>

                                                      <p>The subject in these experiments, a girl named Namin&eacute;, appeared to possess extremely unusual abilities. </p>
                                                      <p>Were they attempting to derive something from these powers? </p>
                                                      <p>Refusing to be distracted by Organization XIII, I had returned to my own secret research when a new visitor appeared at the castle today. </p>
                                                      <p>It was Sora, the Keyblade-wielding hero who had defeated Ansem, and his companions. </p>
                                                      <p>Deep underground, the stench of darkness arose. </p>

                                                      <p>I should have expected nothing less from a Keyblade-wielding hero. </p>
                                                      <p>Sora and friends defied the machinations of Organization XIII and rescued Namin&eacute;. </p>
                                                      <p>Namin&eacute; was a witch who controlled the memories of others. </p>
                                                      <p>Most likely these powers were achieved through a special process when she was born. </p>
                                                      <p>Namin&eacute; is a Nobody, created when a young girl's heart left her body. </p>
                                                      <p>Yet she has no corresponding Heartless. </p>
                                                      <p>This is because the �young girl� in this case was a princess. </p>
                                                      <p>Kairi, a resident of Radiant Garden over which I had ruled, was one of the Seven Princesses that uphold the realm of light. </p>
                                                      <p>With no darkness in her heart, Kairi produced no Heartless, and instead of vanishing, her body remained in the realm of light. </p>
                                                      <p>In other words, both the Nobody called Namin&eacute; and the Heartless�proof of a lost heart�are extremely unstable beings who lack the bodies needed to produce a Nobody. Therefore, they also lack Kairi's memories. One reason for this may be that Kairi's heart did not return to the darkness when separated from her body, but rather migrated to another vessel�deep within Sora's heart. </p>
                                                      <p>That is, Namin&eacute; is an alter ego of the Kairi who has directly interfered with Sora's heart. Could this be why Sora and those whose hearts are connected to him were able to have their memories controlled? </p>
                                                    <p>She is a �non-being� in the truest sense of the word; having not even become a Nobody and with nowhere left to go, she is but the most fleeting of shadows. </p></td>

                                                      <p>Sora went to sleep in order to recover the memories he lost in Castle Oblivion. It would take quite some time to bring back all the memories he had created in his lifetime. </p>
                                                      <p>But Organization XIII held sway over Castle Oblivion. </p>
                                                      <p>Sora would need to be kept someplace more secure. </p>
                                                      <p>I persuaded Namin&eacute; to move the slumbering Sora to Twilight Town for safekeeping. </p>
                                                      <p>Namin&eacute;. </p>
                                                      <p>As I have written here before, she is a most unusual being. </p>
                                                      <p>Born of the same process as a Nobody, but lacking virtually all the elements of a Nobody. </p>
                                                      <p>Perhaps she continues drawing in hopes of capturing that which she lacks: the memories of others, especially Sora. </p>
                                                      <p>I have arrived at a hypothesis. </p>
                                                      <p>I believe that Namin&eacute; was born as a special type of Nobody when Sora attacked himself with the Keyblade, causing his and Kairi's hearts to leave their bodies simultaneously. </p>
                                                      <p>Namin&eacute; emerged as Kairi's Nobody� but the body and soul necessary to exist as a Nobody belonged to Sora. </p>
                                                      <p>When a person's heart is stolen, a Heartless is born with no sense of self, and the body and soul left behind give rise to a Nobody. </p>
                                                      <p>But what if one willingly releases one's heart from one's body? </p>
                                                      <p>Sora and Xehanort retained their selfhood even after becoming Heartless. </p>
                                                      <p>Then there are Kairi and Namin&eacute;. </p>
                                                      <p>Kairi was exceptional for having had no darkness within her heart. Also exceptional was that her heart, once freed, migrated to a new vessel�Sora. </p>
                                                      <p>The combination of these two theoretically unlikely exceptions may be behind this anomaly. </p>
                                                      <p>There are matters I must attend to while Sora is sleeping. </p>

                                                      <p>Surely Sora traveled these same corridors of darkness when he first came to Traverse Town . </p>
                                                      <p>It seems my friend, fighting in the realm of darkness, appeared in Castle Oblivion through a corridor of darkness constructed by Organization XIII. </p>
                                                      <p>My new ally Riku also effected his return via one of these corridors. </p>
                                                      <p>He swore to me he would give his all for his best friend Sora. </p>

                                                      <p>Apart from Namin&eacute;, Nobodies retain their memories of their time as humans, but Sora's Nobody, Roxas, has lost Sora's memories. </p>
                                                      <p>This is likely because Sora's time as a Heartless was short, having recovered his heart and returned to his human form soon after leaving behind Roxas, his Nobody. </p>
                                                      <p>It would seem Roxas is much like Namin&eacute;. Namin&eacute; is Kairi's Nobody, but came into being via Sora's body and soul. </p>
                                                      <p>Likewise, Roxas is Sora's Nobody, but was left behind because Sora's Heartless regained human form using Kairi's heart instead of his own. </p>
                                                      <p>It may be that Sora's memories are slow to return because the half of him that is Roxas is still lacking. </p>
                                                      <p>I must convert Roxas into data and return him to Sora. </p>
                                                      <p>As a member of Organization XIII, it was exceedingly difficult to bring Roxas in. Having lost to Roxas once, Riku laid everything on the line and used the power of darkness in their second battle, only just managing to bring Roxas back with him. </p>
                                                      <p>But Organization XIII grows ever nearer. Here, Twilight Town , is where Roxas was reborn as a Nobody. </p>
                                                      <p>This is where Roxas first encountered Organization XIII and joined its ranks. They are bound to search this place thoroughly. </p>
                                                      <p>First I shall convert all of Twilight Town into data and construct a �world duplicate� in Sora's memories. I shall place Roxas within that world to live out his days and regain those memories. </p>
                                                      <p>There is little time. </p>
                                                    <p>The Organization's schemes must be making steady progress as well. </p></td>

                                                      <p>Sora, Kairi, Riku. </p>

                                                      <p>This hope allowed him to stand his ground and turn the darkness in his heart from an enemy into his greatest weapon. </p>
                                                      <p>When all this is over, it is my fervent hope that he will be able to return with Sora to his Island . </p>
                                                      <p>If I can, I should like to return to Radiant Garden , to look once more upon the beautiful water, the lovely flowers, and the hopeful smiles of the people. </p>
