        <p>Briefly, the performance standards are simple. A handgun bullet must consistently
        penetrate a minimum of 12 inches of tissue in order to reliably penetrate vital organs
        within the human target regardless of the angle of impact or intervening obstacles such as
        arms, clothing, glass, etc. Penetration of 18 inches is even better. Given minimum
        penetration, the only means of increasing wound effectiveness is to make the hole bigger.
        This increases the amount of vital tissue damaged, increases the chance of damaging vital
        tissue with a marginally placed shot, and increases the potential for quicker blood loss.
        This is important because, with the single exception of damaging the central nervous
        system, the only way to force incapacitation upon an unwilling adversary is to cause
        enough blood loss to starve the brain of its oxygen and/or drop blood pressure to zero.
        This takes time, and the faster hemorrhage can occur the better.<br>
        <br>
        The FBI Ammunition Test Protocol is a series of practically oriented tests to measure a
        bullet's ability to meet these performance standards. The result is an assessment of a
        bullet's ability to inflict effective wounds after defeating various intervening obstacles
        commonly present in law enforcement shootings. The overall results of a test are thus
        indicative of that specific cartridge's suitability for the wide range of conditions in
        which law enforcement officers engage in shootings.<br>
        <br>
        The test media used by the FBI to simulate living tissue is 10% Ballistic Gelatin (Kind
        &amp; Knox 250-A), mixed by weight (i.e., one pound of gelatin to 9 pounds of water). The
        gelatin is stored at 4� Centigrade (39.2� Fahrenheit) and shot within 20 minutes of
        being removed from the refrigerator. The temperature of the gelatin is critical, because
        penetration changes significantly with temperature. This specific gelatin mix was
        determined and calibrated by the U.S. Army Wound Ballistics Research Laboratory, Presidio
        of San Francisco, to produce the same penetration results as that obtained in actual
        living tissue. The 10 % gelatin has been correlated against the actual results of over 200
        shooting&nbsp; incidents. Each gelatin block is calibrated before use to insure its
        composition is within defined parameters. Copies of the test protocol are available upon
        request for those interested in duplication the testing or reviewing the procedures in
        greater detail. </p>
        <p>The gelatin blocks for handgun rounds are approximately six inches square and 16 inches
        long. As necessary, additional blocks are lined up in contact with each other to insure
        containment of the bullet's total penetration. Each shot's penetration is measured to the
        nearest 0.25 inch. The projectile is recovered, weighed, and measured for expansion by
        averaging its greatest diameter with its smallest diameter.<br>
        <br>
        The Ammunition Test Protocol using this gelatin is composed of eight test events. In each
        test event, five shots are fired. A new gelatin block and new test materials are used for
        each individual shot. The complete test consists of firing 40 shots. Each test event is
        discussed below in order. All firing in these eight tests events is done with a typical
        service weapon representative of those used by law enforcement.&nbsp; The weapon used is
        fully described in each test report.</td>

        <td valign="top">The gelatin block is bare, and shot at a range of ten feet measured from
        the muzzle to the front of the block. This test event correlates FBI results with those
        being obtained by other researchers, few of whom shoot into anything other than bare
        gelatin. It is common to obtain the greatest expansion in this test.&nbsp; Rounds which do
        not meet the standards against bare gelatin tend to be unreliable in the more practical
        test events that follow.</td>

        <td valign="top">The gelatin block is covered with four layers of clothing: one layer of
        cotton T-shirt material (48 threads per inch); one layer of cotton shirt material (80
        threads per inch); a 10 ounce down comforter in a cambric shell cover (232 threads per
        inch); and one layer of 13 ounce cotton denim (50 threads per inch). This simulates
        typical cold weather wear. The block is shot at ten feet, measured from the muzzle to the
        front of the block.</td>

        <td valign="top">Two pieces of 20 gauge, hot rolled steel with a galvanized finish are set
        three inches apart. The steel is in six inch squares. The gelatin block is covered with
        Light Clothing and placed 18 inches behind the rear most piece of steel. The shot is made
        at a distance of 10 feet measured from the muzzle to the front of the first piece of
        steel. Light Clothing is one layer of the above described T-shirt material and one layer
        of the above described cotton shirt material, and is used as indicated in all subsequent
        test events.<br>
        <br>
        The steel used is the heaviest gauge steel commonly found in automobile doors. This test
        simulates the weakest part of a car door. In all car doors, there is an area, or areas,
        where the heaviest obstacle is nothing more that two pieces of 20 gauge steel.</td>

        the weapon is offset 15� to the side, resulting in a compound angle of impact for the
        bullet upon the glass. The gelatin block is covered with Light Clothing and placed 18
        inches behind the glass. The shot is made at a distance of ten feet, measured from the
        muzzle to the center of the glass pane. This test event with its two angles simulates a

        the muzzle to the front of the glass, and without the 15� offset. The shot is made from

        <td width="23%" valign="top" colspan="2">In addition to the above described series of test
        events, each cartridge is tested for velocity and accuracy. Twenty rounds are fired
        through a test barrel and twenty rounds are fired through the service weapon used in the
        penetration tests. All velocities are measured and reported.<br>
        <br>
        Two ten-shot groups are fired from the test barrel, and two from the service weapon used,
        at 25 yards. They are measured from center to center of the two most widely spaced holes,
        averaged and reported. <br>
        <br>
        Test barrel results demonstrate a round's potential independent of any weapon factors
        which can affect performance. Test barrel results are the purest measure of inherent
        capability for accuracy and velocity.&nbsp; Repeating these tests with a service weapon
        shows how well the cartridge/weapon combination may realize that potential.</td>
