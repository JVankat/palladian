						<p>What are the worst blights facing our society today? A version of that question was asked 104 years ago by Joseph Rowntree, one of Britain's most famous Quakers.  Rowntree thought the "scourges of humanity" facing his world were poverty, war, slavery, intemperance, the opium trade, impurity and gambling. <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article3779988.ece"> A new poll</a> commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation asks a similar question of the UK population today, and the results could have Mr Rowntree turning in his grave.  The "dominant opinion", according to researchers, is that religion is a "social evil" which leads to intolerance and ignorance. </p>

<p>Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society is claiming a victory of sorts; the public, he says, have had it with religion.  I suspect that religion will continue to flourish long after the National Secular Society has ceased to exist.  But the question people of faith need to ask is why the public today are so distrustful of religious believers.  One answer to that question is the public's perception of religious people as Victorian nay-sayers who oppose scientific progress and bemoan the diversity we now see in so much of our society.  One respondent in the study said:  "Faith in supernatural phenomena inspires hatred and prejudice throughout the world, and is commonly used as justification for persecution of women, gays and people who do not have faith."<br />

It is now being attacked from outside and within and needless to say it can't just sit back and say nothing, so on comes the tired old diatribe that pits one religion against another, one community against society as a whole, one man against his neighbour.  I recall someone once described going to war over religion as ‘fighting to see who has the better imaginary friend.’  I suppose it is an irony that, in terms of tolerance, it proves time and again not to have any.  Is it a social evil?  No, it’s just the god-squad buying their stairway to heaven.</p>

Anyway true christians are supposed to love their enemies not simply avoid them. Silence isn’t always a virtue.<br><br>(2) Caustic grace. Yes I know its a contradiction, but it sounds something like this. “God loves you, but because you’re not as good as I am, you’re going to hell, so sharpen up and act like me.”<br><br>(3) Millions of pounds spent on buildings and sound systems and tiered seating and magazines and the creation of our own version of the music world (when ‘secular’ musicians are usually better) and a bundle of other stuff, in an attempt to be relevant while at least half the world starves. I could probably stop right here!<br><br>(4) A disengagement from the community around us. It’s all very well talking about mothers and toddlers and stuff, and even anti-slavery movements but this wasn’t always the case. We should face the fact and be honest about it.<br><br>(5) Quoting an elder in your church, doesn’t, unfortunately, amount to much, he is one of us. The church normally says good things about itself. Maybe when an atheist social worker says the same thing we might have earned the right to crow a bit more.<br><br>(6) Fundamentalists. Harsh, self-righteous, egotistical, often violent.

However, I agree that religions are probably going to survive in some form or other for a very long time.  Not because any one of them is correct, but because us humans aren't going to give up our liking for them too easily.<br><br>The word 'evil' has connotations I could do without, but I do think that religious ideologies detract more than they contribute.<br><br>Religions are straining to hold on to their credibility as the world changes faster than religions are adapting. The current reactions of the religious leaders to these threats seem to be counterproductive, actively encouraging divisiveness and opposing progress to hold onto political influence.  I suspect this has a lot to do with religion turning up on this survey.<br><br>Our brains are amazing things but our higher functions are all too easily switched off by older, more basic traits such as fear and tribalism.  For all its appeals to our good side, religions can be a dangerously easy way to directly access our mental weak spots.<br><br>Religion feeds tribalism by inventing additional ways to divide us for, as I see it, entirely unnecessary reasons.  People in Northern Ireland were not fighting over transubstantiation, but the tribes were maintained by religion's ability (and eagerness) to separate us - taboos on inter-marriage, etc.  There will always be tribes, but to invent additional ones seems a luxury we can ill afford.<br><br>Over-investment in ideologies, religious or not, always seem to lead to problems.  If the system is seen as always much more important than any of the people in it then more of those people will get hurt.  Religious ideologies have an additional risk factor in that their priorities do not need to be grounded to demonstrable entities.  If nothing is more important than your immortal soul or you think you are doing your god's work then it is easier to justify going to extremes.  A person who thinks that their god will reward them for killing would be much further out on their mental limb if religious institutions didn't regard enforcing interpretations of the will of the gods as a reasonable thing to do.<br><br>The presence of so many alternative interpretations should make believers reluctant to impose their version on others and more critical of those who do.  The religious should see the need to discredit the taking of actions that impose on others based on revelation, not just seek to draw the line at bombing.  Take the Catholic ban on contraception.  Most Catholics in developed countries use their freedom to quietly ignore this ruling, but do little to object to its imposition in countries where the Church has greater political influence.<br><br><br>If religion is to hang around, my hope is that it transforms into a more personal, spiritual affair.  The big religious institutions look past their sell-by dates.  We would all benefit if they stopped acting as god's enforcers.  <br><br>I would be happy for the NSS to go extinct first if it is due to the religious seeing the benefits of a level playing field.  This does not require the elimination of religion.<br></p>

For example, if the sacred text says: ‘thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’ (Exodus 22:18), and people burn witches, this testifies to their ignorance, gullibility and obedience to authority rather than necessarily any bad intent. The same applies to messages such as ‘kill the infidel’ or ‘stone homosexuals’.<br><br>These are examples where religious belief encourages people to do bad things. Religion tends to thwart many of the good qualities below.<br><br>Original Pb:<br><br>My own moral compass has a number of points, of which four are outlined below<br><br>NATURE<br>Human beings are social animals, which means they are capable of good and bad. Life’s task is to develop the good qualities of sympathy, kindness, understanding etc., which arise out of a desire for the caring, love and mutual aid than most other animals also display, and to minimise the bad qualities which are also present in nature.<br><br>REASON<br>Reason gives us the ability to sympathise with another’s situation because we have to think out what it would be like to him or her in that situation. To empathise with others is to use our reason as well as our compassion. Reason also means that we take into consideration all our relevant desires and not just the desire that happens to be strongest at the moment. In other words, it involves us thinking about the consequences of our actions. We are rational in proportion as our intelligence informs and controls our desires.<br><br>FREEDOM<br>Mill put this as a basic moral principle, and he was right. We should be as free to think and do what we want so long as we don’t harm others: “over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign”. The extension of people’s freedoms in Europe in the second half of the 20th century bears Mill out. The first half  – of dictatorship,  excessive obedience to political authority, denial of rights, censorship of all opposition  – led to the madness of Auschwitz and the Gulag. <br><br>HAPPINESS<br>Mill’s principle of freedom is not one of selfish indifference. He makes it clear that if we think others are wrong, we should remonstrate, reason, persuade and entreat. And the reason is that liberty is not an end in itself. it is not to be protected for its own sake but because it leads to greater happiness for ourselves and others. The free development of individuality, of unique capabilities, of people’s differences as well as their similarities, is a means whereby each person becomes valuable to himself and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others.<br><br>Mill said that human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing.<br><br>If humankind followed Mill’s path, instead of Moses, Jesus or Mohammed, I think we would be a happier race. Robert Ingersoll said that happiness is the only good. An exaggeration, perhaps, but it is a better message than that found in most ‘sacred texts’.<br><br>Now don't pick on something I didn't mention and make it the focus of your reply. Instead, address some of my points, please, and give us a clue as to your moral principles.  </p>

I thought you made some good points in your original post, but they were a call for internal, self-examination and so I don't have much to contribute in that vein.  <br><br>If you look at the most recent religions, such as Mormonism, it is easier to see their human origins and yet they have thousands of sincere followers who testify to their religion's authenticity.  If you accept that any of these recent arrivals are human institutions then it should be easier to view them from the perspective: "If none of the claims are true, is that a sensible way to go about things?"<br><br>As I do not accept any of the god claims, I fully agree that any of the harm that humans do is caused by humans.  But we are also responsible for the good we do as well - we are a mixed bag.  I already rejected the word 'evil' in relation to religion precisely because I believe it to be a product of humanity, not some malign force.  We have no gods to blame.  That means that we have no gods to help either so we have to be self-critical.  If we are to improve we have to try to get as realistic a view as possible of our strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>As I outlined in my earlier post, religions are not sufficiently well protected against our weaknesses and, in fact, rely on some of them in order to survive.  They are not the product of minds doing evil, but have been slowly adapted and revised as they passed through many generations.<br><br>Rule by Royal decree survived for centuries but was superseded by democracy as we think it serves society better and has more controls against misuse.  This change did not come easy and it is clear that our current system is still far from perfect.  One human construct that seemed obvious at the time and, no doubt achieved great things along with its excesses, was rejected for what we now judge to be a better set of ideas.  Universal suffrage is barely a century old but we already take it for granted.<br><br>Any human system, from democracy to the highway code, can be critiqued on its performance and altered as necessary - if PR looks more effective than 'first past the post' we can change it and review what happens.  These are deliberate human constructs so we can make deliberate human changes if we feel the collective need.  However, it is much harder to do this dispassionately with religion.  The belief in an external source makes it resistant to this sort of deliberate amendment - unless you can convince enough people you are speaking on behalf of that source.<br></p>

But it is also a feature of most religions to be negative and censorious and to want to stress the bad aspects of our nature, as you cannot resist doing in your postscript, which I expected.<br><br>Far from wrecking human rights, humanism is the basis of their development in most western societies. You keep mentioning the abolition of slavery, forgetting that for nearly 2,000 years Christianity sanctioned and practised it. It is present in both the Old and New Testaments, where slaves are told to obey their masters ‘in all things’ (Titus 2:9), ‘just as you would obey Christ’ (Ephesians 6:5).<br><br>What you also fail to grasp is that the campaign to abolish the slave trade and slavery in the UK was led by dissident and nonconformist Christians often accused of being hopelessly naive by their mainstream counterparts. The majority of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade were Quakers, following the philosophy of people like Thomas Paine, born a Quaker but describing himself as a Deist (“I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church”; “My country is the world, and my religion is to do good”). The first parliamentary petition against the slave trade was  presented to the British Parliament by 300 Quakers in 1783. In Ulster it was liberal and republican Presbyterians/C of I like Russell, Drennan, Neilson and Mary Ann McCracken who opposed slavery, not the reactionary elements who won through in the mid-19th century.<br><br>In the west, Orginal Pb, we are all humanists now in the sense that the humanist agenda, which can be traced back to ancient Greece and China, has largely triumphed. Freedom; reason, democracy, tolerance and human rights have all succeeded and are all testimony to the veracity of the humanist project. To be sure, there have been setbacks: the dominance of religion in the Dark Ages and the early Middle Ages created what Charles Freeman calls ‘the closing of the western mind’: “the Greek intellectual tradition... was destroyed by the political and religious forces which made up the highly authoritarian government of the late Roman Empire”. The early 20th produced a new authoritarianism, often religious in character, which created yet more destruction. Since 1945, Humanism, which is the very antithesis of authoritarianism, has once again reasserted its supremacy. The triumph of humane values is the product of Humanism, not the outcome of monotheistic religions.</p>

God is not the God of chaos!<br><br>Instead Paul deliberately instigated a revolution of love within the church on this matter and historical records show this had a major impact on the early church, who largely complied. The serious impact of the church on the Roman Empire at all levels is a matter of record.<br><br>While people often used scripture to justify slavery - and oppose it - theologically, only God will have the final say as to whether those responsible were truly his disciples.<br><br>I respect the fact you have given Wilberforce and friends their place, but you would not for a second sympathise with their biblical beliefs.<br><br>I understand the book of Philemon was widely published as a stand alone leaflet to oppose slavery in America, fyi.<br><br><br>You will also notice that slavery in the bible is not the slavery you understand.<br><br>It was primarily a social security safety net and a form of community service for criminals and POWs.<br><br>Kidnapping someone for slavery in the OT carried the death sentence.

The facts are: it is sanctioned in the Bible and many thousands of Christians had slaves. Biblical Christianity kept slavery alive in the west by giving it an ethical respectability. As Dylan Dog suggests, leaders of the southern states, both political and religious, frequently cited the Bible in defence of slavery. Check out Reverends Alexander Campbell, Nathan Lord and Bishop John England as examples.<br><br>DD is also right about South Africa. The early Dutch, German and Huguenot settlers in South Africa were deeply religious. As Brian Bunting writes: “The Bible was the fountain of their faith”. Afrikaner nationalism and apartheid were essentially spiritual principles. The Afrikaners believed that they were the elect, whereas the native Africans were, like the children of Ham, condemned to be hewers of wood and drawers of water. The Dutch reformed churches were in the vanguard of racism in South Africa. They gave apartheid the stamp of moral approval by backing it to the hilt on the ground that it was God’s will. The mixing of races, according to the 1966 General Synod of the NGK (the largest of the churches)  ‘must be resisted with every resource as wrong and sinful’.<br><br>It was this narrow and crushing Puritanism that poisoned the minds of white South Africans for centuries. So, yes, Peter, people are influenced to do bad things by bad ideas. And puritanism is a bad idea that has greatly influenced Protestantism in Ulster for centuries, so much so that even as long ago as the 17th century, when Ulster Presbyterians attacked Cromwell’s Toleration Laws, John Milton’s ire was raised. What particularly annoyed him was that these ‘blockish Presbyters’ from ‘a barbarous nook of Ireland’ were daring to ‘brand us with the extirpation of laws and liberties; things which they seem as little to understand as aught that belongs to good letters or humanity’. Has much changed in the intervening 350 years? If the Pope is still regarded as the ‘anti-Christ’, you really do wonder how much progress has been made.<br><br>Nice people often have nasty minds because their thoughts have been corrupted by nasty ideologies. That arises partly from an excessive willingness to believe and share belief with others. Greater freethought and scepticism would greatly assist people in thinking more consistently with their better nature.</p>

He's a masked crusader who occasionally pipes up to do battle against hermeneuticial abuse and theological misunderstanding. This week, our very own biblical Stig has been exercised about some commenters' views on slavery and the Bible. <br>IS THE BIBLE PRO-SLAVERY?<br><br>One hesitates to even begin delving into this topic. It is one of those issues where one set of people assume that the bible is invariably dark, bizarre and oppressive whilst another set of people assume that the bible must invariably conform to the canons of modern western liberalism. The truth is somewhat more nuanced, and we can only trace some general contours of the issue here.<br><br>The background to the Bible, both the Old and New Testament, was one where all the major cultures practiced and endorsed slavery. Whether it be the Egyptians of the mid second millennium BC or the Romans of the first millennium AD, slavery was a norm within society. Ancient Israel was not an exception to this, and even a cursory glace within the pages of the OT demonstrates this point. The OT law codes - for example the section known as the Book of the Covenant (Exodus 21 and following) - contain many laws regulating the keeping of slaves. One will look in vain for any text in the OT that simply and unequivocally condemns slavery, because the OT assumes slavery as a basic social norm. <br><br>In ancient Israel, the majority of slaves were actually Hebrew citizens who fell into debt and were forced to voluntarily enter into slavery on a time limited basis. Manumission was automatic after seven years or at other set times. The remainder of the slave populations seems to have been foreigners captured in war, which must have been a fairly insignificant number of people for most of the history of ancient Israel.<br><br>Scholars of the socio-economics of Ancient Israel note that if the lists of people recorded in Ezra are representative, the ratio of free people to slaves was about 5:1 , and that no part of the Israelite economy was dependant upon slave labour. It is assumed that most slaves were employed in non-skilled domestic labour.<br><br>Where the OT differs radically from the norms of the Ancient near East is that the good treatment of slaves is demanded and the human rights of slaves are upheld in many key OT passages. This was particularly true for Hebrew citizens who had temporarily become slaves, but many laws protecting the rights of foreign slaves are to be found in the OT. These include legal protections for foreign women who became slaves in Israel. See, for example, Exodus 21.20, 26, 27; Leviticus 19.20.<br><br>In conclusion, the OT does not denounce slavery as a social institution, but it does recognise slaves as human beings who were to be protected from abuse. So, whilst it may be far in advance of the practices of the Ancient world, it does not conform to modern sensibilities.<br><br>The New Testament has relatively little to say upon the issue of slavery. Most of the NT references are metaphorical, likening the relationship of Christians to their Lord as one of joyous, liberating slavery. This paradoxical language was apposite to its cultural milieu and does not imply an endorsement of slavery. Paul makes it clear that slave trading is abhorrent and places slave traders in the same category as murderers (1 Timothy 1.10 – some versions say kidnappers, but kidnapping for purposes of slavery is intended). <br><br>Nevertheless, some readers of the NT are critical of the fact that there is no outright and whole-scale condemnation of slavery.<br><br>Paul wrote against a cultural setting that denied that slaves were actually full human beings, but rather just relatively worthless chattels. Paul writes so as to wholly undermine this belief system. Paul had to be somewhat circumspect in what he said, lest he be construed by the Romans as a dangerous social revolutionary, but his words were radical in their context. He does not call upon Christian slaves to rise up against their earthly masters, nor does he call upon Christian slave owners to set slaves free. Rather, Paul adopts the strategy of encouraging both to see one another as children of Christ and to respect and love one another for that reason. Paul gently pressurises Philemon to release Onesimus on the grounds that it was wrong for a Christian to keep another Christian as a slave.<br>Paul’s words had the desired effect, and the patristic writings record that most Christian slave owners abandoned the practice on the grounds that it was impossible to keep a fellow Christian in slavery. For this reason, it was common for slave owners in the recent past – in 19th century America for example – to deny slaves access to the New Testament or to anything other than bastardised forms of Christianity. <br><br>William Crawley <br>ENDS<br><br><br>Thanks Brian<br>PB<br></p>

But what I WILL say is that without religion MORE people would do MORE good things and FEWER bad things. Is that clear?<br><br>As for slavery, I think we have all heard your take on that before. It is historically inaccurate. The Christian church became the biggest slave owner in the Roman Empire. Popes kept slaves until the eighteenth century. Ignatius of Antioch (c. 107-117) refused the request of Christian slaves to have their freedom purchased out of the common fund. Augustine (c. 354-430) taught that slavery was God's will and that Christianity did not make slaves free but made good slaves out of bad ones. (The City of God 19.5). Early in the 11th century Pope Benedict VIII condemned the children of priests to be slaves and Pope Clement did likewise to the whole population of Venice in 1309. Pope Paul III decreed slavery for all Englishmen who supported Henry VIII of England. Papal licenses were granted to the Kings of Portugal in the fifteenth century to conquer "heathen" countries and reduce their inhabitants to "everlasting slavery." As it says in Psalm 2: "Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance (as slaves), and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron." <br><br>Altogether, more than eighteen hundred years of Christianity supported the notion of slavery.<br><br>English North Americans embraced slavery because they were Christians, not in spite of it.<br>- Forrest G. Wood, The Arrogance of Faith: Christianity and Race in America from the Colonial Era to the Twentieth Century.<br><br>Slaves were often badly treated by their Christian owners. But at least you do admit AT LAST that slavery is sanctioned in the Bible. Haven’t you heard of the Ku Klux Klan?  Read some of the slave stories. Here’s a couple from the American South. I can give you lots more:<br><br>Frederick Douglass, <br>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass: An American Slave<br><br>“In August, 1832, my master attended a Methodist camp-meeting and there experienced religion. He prayed morning, noon, and night. He very soon distinguished himself among his brethren, and was made a class leader and exhorter...<br>I have seen him tie up a lame young woman, and whip her with a heavy cowskin whip upon her naked shoulders, causing the warm red blood to drip; and, in justification of the bloody deed, he would quote the passage of Scripture, "He who knoweth the master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes." (Luke 12:47)?<br>I prayed for freedom twenty years, but received no answer until I prayed with my legs”.<br><br><br>Moses Roper, <br>Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper (1838)<br><br>“There are several circumstances which occurred on this estate while I was there, relative to other slaves, which it may be interesting to mention. Hardly a day ever passed without some one being flogged. To one of his female slaves he had given a dose of castor oil and salts together, as much as she could take; he then got a box, about six feet by two and a half, and one and a half feet deep; he put this slave under the box, and made the men fetch as many stones as they could get, and put them on the top of it; under this she was made to stay all night. I believe, that if he had given this slave one, he had given her three thousand lashes. Mr. Gooch was a member of a Baptist church. His slaves, thinking him a very bad sample of what a professing Christian ought to be, would not join the connection he belonged to, thinking they must be a very bad set of people; there were many of them members of the Methodist church. On Sunday, the slaves can only go to church at the will of their master, when he gives them a pass for the time they are to be out. If they are found by the patrol after the time to which their pass extends, they are severely flogged.”<br><br>When Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, the Southern Presbyterian Churcch issued this statement in 1864: “We hesitate not to affirm that it is the peculiar mission of the Southern Church to conserve the institution of slavery, and to make it a blessing both to master and slave." The Church also insisted that it was "unscriptural and fanatical" to accept the dogma that slavery was inherently sinful: it was "one of the most pernicious heresies of modern times" .<br><br><br>So stop trying to justify the unjustifiable and rewrite history to suit your conscience, please!<br><br>And what about apartheid, Pb? You haven’t answered it. Do you deny that it was religiously as well as racially inspired? Do you deny that Afrikaner leaders, from the time of Kruger and even earlier, were nearly all Calvinist to the core and believed that apartheid fitted their religious creed? Perhaps you will be telling us that apartheid, like slavery, was 'a kind of social security system.<br><br></p>

Gods, souls, eternal punishment and glorious leaders can be made to seem so much more important than any mere mortal concern - protecting them above all else might result in the worst of outcomes for the best of intentions.<br><br>There were a couple of recent cases in the states where parents watched their children die slow, painful deaths without calling for a doctor because they are convinced that, if they prayed hard enough, Jesus would save them if that was his plan.  I think it reasonable to suspect distorted values caused by wrong beliefs, rather than simply say these are bad people.  The origin of these beliefs may also have been sincere, if extreme, interpretation rather than deliberate desire to do harm.  Ideas can almost take on a life of their own, as a succession of people develop and extend an initial set of assumptions.  There seems a greater danger of this the fewer chances there are to test the claims of a belief system.<br><br>I don't think we can completely escape from our ability to do great harm, but feel our best chances of preventing it is to fully understand the circumstances that bring such horrors about.<br><br>When looking at what Hitler was able to 'achieve', I don't view this only as the dangers of one lone madman, or some peculiarities of the Germans - it could happen anywhere given the wrong circumstances and points to how fragile our veneer of civilisation can be.  On a recent edition of 'The Big Questions' someone claimed that the existence of a real, non-metaphorical devil was the 'only reasonable explanation' for the crimes of Hitler.  As someone else pointed out on the show, such an appeal to external causes only reduces our chances of understanding what really led to these events and what checks and balances would help prevent a repeat.<br><br>Such horrors can happen without religion, Stalin managed it, but religion is no defence against it.  Hitler used religious rhetoric, enlisted support of the church to gain power, built on centuries of Christian anti-Semitism, and had his plans carried out in a majority Christian population. This does seem to weaken the case for religion as an antidote to such dangers.  <br><br>Religion adds particular risks as it encourages acceptance of undemonstrable claims, reinforces divisions, and resists predictable change.  Deliberate human systems will not solve all problems, but should at least be easier to adjust.  I do not know to what extent any system can protect us, but would prefer to have more ability to influence their development than is possible with religion.  <br><br>For comparison, not as a proposed replacement, consider the scientific method.  Science could easily have kept an authoritative structure, given the many big egos involved in its development.  Instead it presumes that people make mistakes, scientists sometimes see what they want to see and maybe even cheat.  The whole system is set up to encourage challenge and testing.  New papers are checked by anonymous peers.  After publication, others try to reproduce the claim, or find holes in the data. The fastest way to get a Noble prize is to supersede an accepted theory.  By setting the system up in recognition of our faults it helps protect against them.  This is a very artificial system that can be tough on the people involved but, because the expectations and benefits are clear, everyone co-operates.<br><br>We have moved from discussing the truth claims of religions to their utility.  In this vein, I would hate to think that the only way that we can have functioning societies is by inventing lies to get us to behave.  Some American neocons talked of needing a Great Myth in order to bind the nation - post cold-war this meant finding a new enemy so the population pulls together to face the external threat.  This seems too cynical to me.<br></p>

Also, it is liberal and secular state and societies, not the churches, which stand as the guarantor of freedom and human rights. The truth is that human rights were and are being achieved today not because of the Bible but in spite of it. <br><br>Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Southern Confederacy in the USA stated: "It (slavery) was established by decree of Almighty God and is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments from Genesis to Revelation". He was right. Here is a list of references, some of which you have twisted to suit your own conscience (e.g. Deut.):<br><br>Exodus: 21:4, 7-9<br>Lev: 25:44-46<br>Deut: 15:11-17<br>Proverbs: 29:19<br>Joel: 3:8<br>Matt: 10:24-25<br>Luke: 12: 46-47<br>Luke 19:11-27<br>John: 13:16<br>1 Corinthians: 12:13<br>Galatians: 3:28<br>Ephesians: 6:5<br>Colossians: 3:11, 16<br>1 Timothy: 6:1-2<br>Titus: 2:9-10<br>1 Peter: 2:18<br><br>A couple of comments from above.<br><br>"When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be punished; for the slave is his money."<br>– Exodus 21:20-21<br><br>So, not only does the Bible explicitly allow beating your slaves but it also allows you to beat them to death, just as long as the slave does not immediately expire from the beating but lingers for a few days before dying. Pretty nasty, eh?<br><br>Now turn to this passage in the New Testament:<br><br>"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes".<br>– Luke 12:46-47<br><br>Here Jesus works slavery into a parable as if it were the most natural thing in the world, favourably comparing God to a slaveholder who beats his slaves for not obeying him.<br><br>You talk about the meaning of the term 'slave'. It means someone who is bound in servitude as the property of another, or who is treated as subservient to another and made to work 'as a slave' on their behalf. Under these definitions, slavery is definitely sanctioned in the Bible. There’s no earthly point in denying it.<br><br>And let us not forget that in Genesis 3:16, as a result of the 'Fall', the wife is to be henceforth ruled over by her husband, thus relegating women to the status of a slave  – precisely how they were treated, by and large, for most of the next 2,000 years of Christendom  – and sanctioned by the Bible.<br><br>Now, what about racism in South Africa. Come on, tell us that the Christian racists there also sadly misintepreted Holy Writ. There's an awful of misinterpretation of the sacred text by Christians over the two millennia. Have they sorted out the true meaning yet?<br><br></p>

Absolutely not - on the contrary it was a great leap forward in human rights for the region and epoch.<br><br>There remains the question (for me) as to whether Deut 21 would have been required to have been obeyed in conjunction with other anti-rape legislation in the OT which would seem more in common with modern sentiment - but what foundation is there for that?<br><br>Are you so civilised today DD, Brian, Non-plussed when you support dicing up unborn babies in the womb or killing elderly people? Or perhaps none of you do????<br><br><br>Why did God allow Deut 21? He was constantly tempted to destroy Israel because of their disobedience and I (and Matthew Henry) think he thought this was the best he could achieve with the Israelites at this time. Christ says God allowed very lax divorce in the OT "because of the hardness of their hearts" but that this was rescinded under Him. In the OT men could divorce women very easily but Christ condemned this as an abuse of the law and called for marriage to be permanent, save for adultery etc. So it is clear God saw some OT law as very suspect.<br><br>The church is advised not to follow OT law in Romans, Galatians and Hebrews BTW. The NT in its own right does however make clear conduct and practises that  are and  are  not acceptable in the church, some of which does echo OT law.<br><br>You will notice in Will's entry on slavery quoted above, the early Patristic writings showed that Paul's writings were largely successful in removing slavery from the early church.<br><br>This does not challenge the fact that many people later used the bible to justify a different type of slavery. But people like John Newton, author of Amazing Grace, would be one example of an unbeliever who was heavily involved too<br><br>To lay the blame fully at the door of the church is too simplistic, especially as the church (Wilberforce and Wesley) overcame it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Brian -<br><br>you are completely missing the point. <br><br>Please name the humanists who ended slavery in the UK and invented the freedom of the press.<br><br>I put my money on Wilberforce and William III, two men who professed belief in Christ.<br><br>The role of the media in British society began under legal reform with William III.<br><br><br>I am sorry but, the ten commandments are most certainly the basis for UK law.<br><br>This is historical fact.

It is a fair point by any standard.<br><br>In another passage, if the owner knocks a slaves tooth out the slave walks free etc etc.<br><br>All the passages are there Brian but only in an analysis such as post 56 or post 52.<br><br>You are plucking passages out at random which are quite valid but you are willfully refusing any attempt to understand the whole.<br><br>PLEASE CAN YOU PROVIDE A LIST OF HUMANISTS FROM THE FOLLOWING PERIODS TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF SLAVES;-<br><br>1) The time of ancient Israel (the Jewish law broke new ground in their rights).<br><br>2) The time of Paul in the Roman Empire (Paul taught the church that slaves were equal to their masters, trading in slaves would exclude one from heaven and he promoted a case study in freeing a slave, into the NT canon ie the Letter to Phileom).<br><br>3) The time of Wilberforce who was backed by John Wesley and the Quakers in abolishing slavery in the British Empire. Wilberforce was also backed by hymn writer John Newton.<br><br>4) Abe Lincoln who could not speak highly enough of the bible, also fought for the freedom of slaves.<br><br>5) Today, Steve Chalke is heading up Stop the Traffik, and international coalition against trafficking.

Why can’t you accept that the Bible was written in a primitive, barbaric age and as such reflects the primitive, barbaric attitudes of that age? No sensible interpretation can deny such things without doing violence to the text itself, and nothing can be criticised as having been ‘taken out of context’. The bee in your bonnet to absolve the Bible from support for slavery is really an entirely futile endeavour. The God of the Old Testament is a cruel God, and expects his people to be cruel, as frequent references to the treatment of women, non-Israeli tribes and even the Israelites themselves (Abraham’s sacrifice, the slaughter of the Mideanite women and children, the flood, Jephthah burning his daughter alive as a sacrificial offering for victory, etc) make abundantly clear. Indeed, God frequently orders his people to commit genocide. You seem to imagine that God, who treats Israel’s enemies and women so badly, not to mention the Israelites themselves at times, wants everybody to treat slaves more humanely! Now that would be a real twist in the tale. <br><br>At times, you seem to believe that the Bible was ghost-written by God and its code of ethics is ‘objective’. But this implies that whatever it says about slavery is God’s unchanging word. So the dissident Christians who campaigned to abolish it were misguided and all the millions of mainstream white Christians who supported it and practised it were therefore correct all along! Why do you support those Christians who worked to abolish slavery if the unerring Bible sanctions it?<br><br>At other points (its code was ‘a great leap forward for its time’), you seem to imply that morality is relative and that the Bible was an ancient document, though a little advanced for that era. Again, “so it is clear God saw some OT law as very suspect”. Obviously, the laws you don’t like were not God’s laws. Talk about having your cake and eating it! <br><br>A good example of your double standards is the Biblical condemnation of homosexuality. This is taken literally. Thus Leviticus 18:22: "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination."  In other words, homosexuality is wrong. Now take Leviticus 25:44: "And as for your male and female slaves whom you may have - from the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves". In other words, you can buy slaves so long as they are from neighbouring nations. If you use Leviticus to justify a condemnation of homosexuals, then I’m afraid you are a supporter of slavery. But, of course, slavery is a lost cause, at least in the UK, whereas gays are still treated unfairly, so they probably deserve it.<br><br>Your interpretation of Exodus 21:20-21 is bizarre. Let us take the whole chapter, where the guidelines for the buying, selling and treatment of slaves is given. God says in verse 4 that if a male slave marries, his wife and children shall remain with the master when the slave departs because technically speaking they belong to the master. That’s a bit cruel, is it not, Pb? If the slave is imprudent enough to protest because he loves his wife and children and wants to stay on, the consequences can be pretty drastic. In verse 6 the master is directed to "Bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever". Phew! Pretty savage, eh? In 7-9 God even instructs men how they are to go about selling their own daughters into slavery. In 20-21, to repeat, God clearly says that if the master beats a slave to death, the master shall be punished. If, however, the severely beaten slave lingers on for a day or two, the master is off the hook. Then God says in 28-32 that if an ox gores a slave, the ox's owner shall give the slave master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned to death. Poor thing! Obviously, God is not kind to oxen.<br><br>The NT is no better than the OT. 1 Tim. 6:1-2 “Let slaves regard their masters as worthy of all honour." Matthew 10:24 and John 13:16 remind us that slaves are never better than their masters. In Titus 2:9-10 slaves are ordered to “be submissive to your master and give satisfaction in every respect". Also look at Ephesians 6:5 and Colossians 3:22 which say, “Slaves obey your master." Of the venerated Ten Commandments to which you refer, numbers four and ten recognise and therefore give tacit approval to slavery.<br><br>Peter, Jesus' favourite disciple, directs slaves to obey and fear their master without question, even though he may be cruel and unjust (1 Peter 2:18). This directive is repeated in Ephesians 6:5. In Exodus 21:26-27 and Proverbs 29:19 God tells the masters how to punish their slaves. <br><br>The early Christians supported slavery. John Chrysostom wrote: “The slave should be resigned to his lot, in obeying his master he is obeying God”. St Augustine wrote: “Slavery is now penal in character and planned by that law which commands the preservation of the natural order and forbids disturbance”.<br><br>In the 18th century Edmund Gibson, Anglican Bishop in London, made it clear  that Christianity freed us from the slavery of sin, not from earthly and physical slavery: “The freedom which Christianity gives, is a freedom from the bondage of sin and Satan, and from the dominion of men's lusts and passions and inordinate desires; but as to their outward condition, whatever that was before, whether bond or free, their being baptised, and becoming Christians, makes no manner of change in it”.<br><br>Christian support for slavery was often based upon interpretation of passages which might be accurate or inaccurate but, as I have already stated, the ambiguity allows for it. Take this example. We read in Genesis 9 that Noah's son Ham comes upon him sleeping off a drinking binge and sees his father naked. Instead of covering him, he runs and tells his brothers. Shem and Japheth, the ‘good’ brothers, return and cover their father. In retaliation for Ham's ‘sinful act’ of seeing his father nude, Noah puts a curse on his grandson (Ham's son) Canaan: “Cursed be Canaan; lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers" (Gen 9:25). Over time, this curse came to be interpreted that Ham was literally ‘burnt’, and that all his descendants had black skin, marking them as slaves with a convenient colour-coded label for subservience.<br><br>Some of those in the vanguard of the abolition of slavery were religious, and some were not. The Christian supporters of abolition in the 18th and early 19th centuries were in a distinct minority of Christians. The Quakers were generally regarded as hopelessly naive in their opposition to slavery by most other Christians.<br><br><br>The agnostics and atheists who supported freedom and human rights were the majority of atheists and agnostics. You have to accept that until very recently few prominent people have openly declared themselves as non-believers. This is especially true of MPs. Many of the known figures were first and foremost writers. Human rights had their roots in the 18th century Enlightenment and early 19th century reformers who were all atheists, agnostics or deists: in France, Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, D’Holbach; in America most of the Founding Fathers, like Jefferson, Hamilton and Franklin; in the UK, Hume, Bentham, Mill.<br><br><br>Atheists/agnostics who have worked on behalf of human rights in the modern era are too numerous to list in full. Here’s a sample:<br><br>Graham Allen MP, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Tariq Ali, Shulamit Aloni, Baba Amte, Dan Barker, Lord Birt, Noam Chomsky, Nick Clegg MP, Robin Cook, Andrew Copson, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Baron Desai, Frank Dobson MP, Albert Einstein, Barbara Ehrenreich, Oriana Fallaci, Robert Fisk, Baroness Flather, Michael Foot, Bill Gates, Bob Geldof, Nadine Gordimer, Mikhail Gorbachev, Germaine Greer, Roy Hattersley, Christopher Hitchens, Lionel Jospin, Ludovic Kennedy, Neil Kinnock, Gladys Kinnock, Wujud Lafti, Richard Leakey, Ken Livingstone, Arthur Miller, Mo Mowlam, Taslima Nasrin, Pandit Nehru, Conor Cruise O’Brien, Harold Pinter, Mary Robinson, Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie, Bertrand Russell, Brian Sedgemore MP, George Soros, Baroness Turner, Arnold Wesker.<br><br><br>I am still waiting for your response on Christian racism in South Africa.<br><br></p>

It is all too infrequently recognized that this section of Deuteronomy actually represents the most humane extant law for the treatment of women and girls during warfare in the entire history of the ancient Near East. Rape of captive women by conquerors has been the inevitable consequence of military action throughout history. Deuteronomy makes it quite clear that such treatment of women –even enemy women- was forbidden. The Mosaic legislation not only precluded soldiers acting on impulsive sexual desires on the battlefield, it specifically precluded selling captive women as slaves (no “sex-slaves” here!). The only condition under which an Israelite soldier was allowed to have relations with a captive woman was that she be made a proselyte (which required her agreement) and that she be made a wife with all the rights and privileges accorded to any other Israelite wife. The couple, man and woman, were subject to all of the laws pertaining to Israelite marriage. <br><br><br>2. Deuteronomy 21:10-14 as Anti-Rape Legislation. No intercourse was permitted until and unless all the requirements and solemn rites were performed by both parties. Desire was not enough to legitimate intercourse with a captive female; there must be a willingness to allow her to become a part of one’s household and accord her all of the rights which belonged to a naturally-born Jew. Marriage could only take place after a period of mourning (the same mourning period pertained to Israel generally; cf. Num 20:29; Deut 34:8) . She was to be treated with humanity and sensitivity and could not be treated as a slave. Many ancient Rabbis maintained that the shaving of her head functioned not only as the standard purification rite accompanying freely chosen conversion, but also to make the captive woman appear less attractive, resembling a gourd or pumpkin shell, and this in his own house so that he would see her frequently (cf. Midrash Halakhah; Midrash Tannaim, Midrash Hagadol, bYevamot 48aff; Rashi; Maimonides, Toldoth Adam, and Torah Tmimah). If the marriage took place, it would only do so after a period of sober consideration and a willingness to make the same commitment which pertained to marriages generally. <br><br><br>3. Neither marriage nor conversion was forced. Israelites were prohibited from marrying any foreign woman, captive or not, unless she willingly underwent ritual purification by a solemn rite. The shaving of the head was specifically just such a rite (e.g. Num 8:7, etc.). The Midrash Hagadol stated that if the captive female did not wish to convert initially she was to be given twelve months to think it over. If she did not wish to become a proselyte, she faced the choice of living as a resident alien (non Jewish, but required to live according to the standards which pertained to Noah before the covenant Abraham or Moses; according to Midrash Hagadol if these standards were repudiated she would be killed, although it is apparent from Deuteronomy that if she had no place in Israel she was free to go: "you shall let her go wherever she wishes"). It is frequently considered inconceivable that a captive woman might actually view her conquerors in a positive light; the manner in which women and children were often -not just sometimes- treated in the ancient world, even by their parents, dispels this uncritical assumption. <br>ENDS<br></p>

I agree entirely. We don't need to debate this point further.<br>2) You note that there are many passages in the bible which regulate and therefore condone slavery plus I would add that nowhere does the bible actually condemn slavery. We dont need to debate this point further.<br>3) You also say the bible is sufficiently ambiguous on slavery to easily allow its abuse. <br><br>My answer to that is that it depends on how careful you are to read the entirety of what the bible says on slavery. One can be determined to make money on slaves and use parts of the bible as justification - or indeed one can be determined to condemn the the biblical record on slavery without reading its full record. Neither position has any integrity from an intellectual point of view as both refuse to see the full biblical record in order to meet a predetermined outcome - profit or prejudice. <br><br>Your key points 1 and 2 are not at all threatened by me saying that the bible has always put up a fight for groundbreaking rights for slaves' in the times in which the OT and NT were written. I have established above that Pauls writings on slavery caused a quiet revolution against slavery which wiped it out of the early church and also Europe centuries later. <br><br>4) You seem to write from the position which at least almost allows people to believe that slavery was invented by the OT law. Of course slavery was worldwide at that time but the OT was groundbreaking in recognising slaves as humans and giving them many legal protections. Most were Hebrew and as such were freed after six years with a day off each week in their six years. Slavery here was primarily a social security net, and community service for debtors, criminals and POWs. Kidnapping people for slavery carried the death penalty. Paul's letter to Philemon was a case study in freeing a slave which was circulated to all churches; the Roman Empire was a slave economy and openly condemning slavery would have been a disaster, drawing down the wrath of the Empire.<br><br>5) It must be said that the greatest foes that Abe Lincoln and William Wilberforce came up against seem to have been merchants who were making money out of slaves, not churches or preachers, though certainly some/many approved of the trade. But many churches also opposed slavery. And Ulster for example was strongly anti-slavery though a small minority in it profited from the trade. <br><br>However the backlash against slavery was to come primarily from churches and people of faith....with secular influence too!<br><br> Enc Brit;-<br>"It should be noted, however, that the major decisions regarding the abolition of the slave trade were taken outside Africa and were responses to economic and political changes and pressures in Europe and America. Many of the Christian churches had never accepted the morality of trading in human beings, and the 18th-century Evangelical movements in Protestant Europe led to open campaigning against the Atlantic slave trade and also against the institution of slavery itself. These things were equally condemned by new secular currents of thought associated with the French Revolution....."<br><br>Again we note the battle was primarily on economic grounds, not religious;-<br><br>".... many African governments and merchants were no more inclined than many European or American governments or merchants to enforce or to observe the anti-slave-trade treaties that British officials wished upon them. They saw no reason why their economic interests, which were bound up with slavery and trade in slaves, should be subordinated to the new economic interests of British traders following what was to them the capricious decision that slavery and the slave trade were wrong."<br><br>6) So here are four landmarks from people of faith in slavery; Moses' OT law was a huge step forward for slaves' rights; Paul freed the early church and hundreds of years later, also Europe from slavery; William Wilberforce and Abe Lincoln (both men of deep Christian faith, though Abe was unorthodox) broke slavery in the British Empire and America. Those are arguably the four finest moments in the anti-slavery movement in history tp that point. And the fight goes on.<br><br>7) So is religion a social evil? Well regarding slavery, I contend that while judeo-christian faith was used to justify slavery (though the bible clearly condemns kidnapping and slave TRADING) many churches did condone it. However I also argue the driving force of slavery was really commerical greed and the Christian religion (actually a bastardised form of it) was primarily really just an excuse to cover the main motive - greed. If the four greatest figures in fighting back slavery in history were people of judeo Christian faith, (Moses, Paul, Wilberforce, Lincoln) you are going to have a hard time to convince me that judeo-christian faith, on balance, has been a force for evil regaring the plight of slaves down through history. But fire away in the interests of debate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Deut 21 - TAKING WIVES IN WAR PASSAGE - TESTING OUR ASSUMPTIONS<br><br>There appear to be several assumptions we can bring to this text;<br>1) That the wife's family were murdered.<br>2) That she was forced to convert to judiasm.<br>3) She was forced into marriage/rape<br>4) That she was a slave<br>5) That our intial reading of the text is infallibly correct.<br><br>But here are some questions;-<br>1) Israel was explicitly used by God to wipe out nations which had refused to repent and were sold out to child sacrifice, incest, sexual abuse of animals, communing with and worshipping demons, etc etc etc. Would her parents have been murdered or judicially killed?<br>2) I have not seen any evidence to support the idea that judiasm was imposed on people from other nations. Some argue that this religious conversion could therefore only have been voluntary. It is also noted that the soldier was forbidden by law to marry a woman who was not of his faith. So what evidence is there of forced conversion to Jehovah and could the marriage have proceeded if she didn't convert?<br>3) The norm in Eastern culture has been for arranged marriages where the wife usually has no say in who has sexual relations with her. Is this rape if her consent has not been sought? If her consent is not a factor in whether or not she married the soldier, would it have been sought in an arranged marriage?<br>4) The passage is explicit that she is not to be treated as a slave but given the full rights of a Jewish wife.<br>5) The hasty zeal with which athiests devour these few verses in isolation and rapidly form dogmatic conclusions is noted. But which is the firmer conclusion from this; that the bible is most definitely not the word of Jehovah, or that those devoted to opposing Him have come to the text with hasty and extreme prejudice?<br>6) Even if scholarship shows this passage to show imposed marriage, doesnt the legislation still show a massive jump forward for its time in forbidding battlefield rape in Israel?

You really do need to define your usage of the term ‘slavery’. <br><br>2. The period during which the Old Testament was written (1500 BC to 500 BC) was a time in the world when slavery was commonplace. Indeed, the Hebrews, for whom and by whom the Old Testament was written, were enslaved in Egypt (Exodus). Centuries later, many Hebrews were once again enslaved during the period of Babylonian captivity. By the time of Jesus, as many as thirty percent of the residents of the Roman Empire were slaves. Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that both the OT and the NT comment on the relationship between slave and master. There is no specific condemnation of slavery to be found anywhere in the Bible. At no point does God express even mild disapproval of enslaving human beings, robbing them of what freedom and independence they might have had. On the contrary, God is depicted as both approving of and regulating slavery, ensuring that the traffic and ownership of fellow human beings proceeds in an acceptable manner. In many cases, the regulations display a horrible disregard for the lives and dignity of enslaved individuals, hardly the sort of thing one would expect from a loving God. Whatever you say, you cannot rewrite Deuteronomy 20. At other times, it seems more generous and advocates treating slaves well. The latter may be more advanced in its attitude than some groups, but what does that prove? Moreover, the contradictoriness is perfectly in keeping with a collection of writings spanning a thousand years.<br><br>3. In all communities in the past, there were men of compassion who urged slaveowners to treat their slaves humanely. This was not unique to Judaism or Christianity. For example, wanton cruelty in the treatment of slaves was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi, one of the most famous of ancient documents. promulgated between 2100 and 1800 B.C.<br><br>4. Some individuals and groups even opposed slavery. The Cynics and Stoics in ancient Greece opposed it. Alcidamas, for example, said: "God has set everyone free. No one is made a slave by nature." Furthermore, a fragment of a poem of Philemon also shows that he opposed slavery. In his play Hecuba (424 BC)  Euripides writes of slavery: "That thing of evil, by its nature evil, Forcing submission from a man to what no man should yield to”. These people, not the Bible, were well ahead of their time in opposing slavery.<br><br>5. According to Philo (20BC-50AD), the Alexandrian Jewish philosopher, the Essene Sect actually renounced slavery altogether and practised a form of primitive communism, sharing homes and property and pooling their earnings. Furthermore, "not a single slave is to be found among them, but all are free, exchanging services with each other, and they denounce the owners of slaves, not merely for their injustice in outraging the law of equality, but also for their impiety in annulling the statute of Nature”.<br><br><br>6. On the other hand, it is clear that slavery is accepted in the OT and the NT as a fact of life. Let us turn to Paul. In the Epistle to Philemon, a runaway slave is returned to his master; in Ephesians 6, the duty owed by a slave to his master is compared with the duty owed by a child to his parent, and the slave is enjoined “to be obedient to them that are your masters, according to the flesh, in fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ”. Parents and masters are likewise enjoined to show consideration for their children and slaves. All humans, of the true faith, were equal in the eyes of God and in the afterlife but not necessarily in the laws of man and in this world. Those not of the true faith were in another, and in most respects an inferior, category.<br><br>7. The European countries were the first to abolish slavery. Why? This was not primarily the influence of Christianity but of secular values. Contrary to the impression you are giving, Britain (1807) was not the first country to abolish slavery. Iceland abolished it in 1117, followed by Finland and Sweden in 1335, Portugal (1761), and France (1794). <br><br>8. There are many other aspects of this question than slavery, which at least in a formal sense hasn’t been an issue since the 19th century. By concentrating on slavery, you can imply that the ‘social evil’ is all in the dim and distant past. But not so, Pb, not so.<br><br>9. The thread is about religion ‘as a social force’, not about individual religious people, many of whom have done good works, nor is it about individual non-believers, many of whom have also done good works. The issue is whether or not the social impact of religion is good or bad. On balance, the Christian religion has done more harm than good. It has sanctioned or implemented slavery, discrimination against women, anti-semitism, homophobia, the crushing of dissent, and censorship of literature, art and science. It has divided people against one another and incited wars, hatred and intolerance. It has brainwashed the young and endeavoured to close their minds to inquiry, knowledge and understanding. It has promoted fear and irrationality. It has done all these things ruthlessly when it had had the power to do so, and has only become more humane as its power and influence has diminished.<br><br>10. I have mentioned apartheid. So far you have said nothing about it. Apartheid, or institutionalised racism and segregation, was made respectable by the Dutch Reformed Churches, all of whom not only supported it and justified it on Biblical grounds but actually urged the government to implement it. They were in the vanguard of apartheid from the beginning. When the National Party (which ruled South Africa from 1948-1994) was formed in 1914, a number of DRC ministers joined it. In 1923 the NGK (the largest church, to which 80% of Afrikaners belong) passed a resolution approving partial racial segregation. In 1936 the Cape Synod of the NGK asked the government to prevent mixed marriages. In 1942 the Federal Mission Council of the NGK asked Smuts to tighten ‘residential and economic segregation: “It is the sacred conviction of the Afrikaner people and Church that the only salvation of the people’s existence lies in the implementation of this principle of race separation”. The call for separate living areas, or ‘territorial apartheid, was reiterated by a national conference of the Dutch Reformed Churches in 1950.<br><br>Various justifications were offered for this policy of apartheid. Primarily, it was said to be God’s will. The different races of mankind were put asunder by God and should not be joined together by man. the mixing of races, according to the 1966 General Synod of the NGK, “must be resisted with every resource as wrong and sinful”. A ‘Christian state’ should prohibit ‘racial mixing and mixed marriages’. The mixing of races is sinful. There you have it literally in black and white. The 1974 Synod even advocated an extension of this prohibition to marriage between members of certain black ethnic groups.<br><br>Sure, Galatians 3:28 talks of everyone being ‘one in Christ’. But the point of course is that in Calvinist terms the oneness in Christ is a spiritual unity which does not negate racial differences or colour boundaries in the world at large. The blacks had a part to play, but it was largely as the children of Ham (or Canaan, if you prefer): ‘hewers of wood and drawers of water’.<br><br>South Africa under apartheid is a clear and tragic paradigm of the ‘social evil’ caused by an exclusivist religious ideology. Racism in SA has always had powerful theological underpinnings. The Calvinist world view shaped the Afrikaners’ vision of non-whites from the beginnings. Afrikaner nationalism and Calvinist Christianity were fused in a poisonous cocktail.</p>

If your god is responsible then we are entitled to contrast claims of this god as being the only source of objective moral standards against the low quality of his early work in this area.  A perfect and timeless god can't be let off by saying it was all a long time ago.<br><br>Hence the need for all the mental pretzels on display here, such as 'progressive revelation' and 'slavery as welfare'.  You are right to say such arguments are neither new nor advanced - quite the opposite.  These poor fig-leafs for biblical inconsistency sound particularly inadequate when deployed against such depravity - as when you suggest that your all-powerful foundation for morality might make do with the position: 'I can't tell them to stop raping, but at least they're not doing it on the battlefield anymore'.<br><br>You wish to declare that the Bible is a source of divine moral wisdom and so need to blame its obvious major deficiencies on 'fallen' man.  Your attempts to do so here seem to be further damaging any claims you might have wanted to make about the reliability of the Bible as a moral guide book.   You previously said that Paul could not explicitly condemn slavery as he put political expediency above clarity.  Now you say "God saw some OT law as very suspect" but it nonetheless was "the best he could achieve with the Israelites at this time".  So, with all these deficiencies in your divine guidance, how can you be sure you are interpreting it correctly?  <br><br>The 'New' Testament is now almost 2,000 years old - how much of this is timeless advice and how much is just the best God could achieve at this time? <br><br>If you accept that it is possible that Deut 21 permits rape but don’t think any of us "are qualified to comment here and now" you seem to be accepting that the Bible is not only compromised but contradictory and confusing.  I thought you said your god was not " the God of chaos" - all the misinterpretations of his holy book seem to have caused a fair bit of it.<br><br>You still have given no satisfactory reason why your god had the confidence to unambiguously ban murder and coveting up front, but didn't feel so able to clarify his position on rape and slavery.  Was it really a higher priority to sort out all those dietary restrictions first?  The idea of an all-powerful moral god having a list of evils he can't quite bring himself to ban yet is especially implausible.<br><br><br>In order to justify the circumstances in Deut 21 you say "Israel was explicitly used by God to wipe out nations which had refused to repent…".  You are invoking a religious genocide so you can maybe redefine murder as 'Judicial killing'?!  You previously said that "theocracies are bad … because all men are fallen and prone to excess" - does that not apply to the men in the OT?   How can you tell which atrocities really are the will of your god? <br>You directly follow this with the claim that Judaism was never imposed on people from other nations - wiping them out for disobeying doesn’t count?<br><br>You question the absence of an authority for my values, but the authority you claim for yours seems a very mixed bag indeed.<br><br><br>You ask why I complain of attempts to impose religious beliefs on others.  I already explained what I meant by this (in the post where I observed we seemed stuck in a loop, ironically enough) but it would include your willingness to frustrate research into disease due to your interpretation of "God's side of this argument"<br>I have said nothing that justifies your use of the phrase "atheistic totalitarianism".  As I have explained, I wish believers to accept that laws impacting all of us should be determined based on a framework accessible to all, using criteria such as demonstrable harm.<br>If you accept that the evidence we expect in support your claim isn't available and that the moral guidance of the bible is contradictory and confusing, will you also accept that those who aren't convinced shouldn't be subject to bans based on "God's side of this argument"?<br><br><br>This thread's topic is 'Is Religion a "social evil"?' - one problem with religion is its ability to get good people to defend the indefensible.  The same mechanisms that drive some to defend their god's involvement in historical atrocities is deployed by others to enable the commission of new ones.  <br>You previously said: "Believers are not perfect in fact they are vulnerable to unbalanced sub cultures and non believers are often a good foil to them because they lack these cultural filters".  This is an area where you are in need of such a foil, PB, but you perceive it as an attack rather than a signal to reassess. <br><br><br>You said: "I take it from your comment that this has been "a very productive conversation" that you felt you made - and needed to - make up a lot of lost ground in our debate with me.  I accept the compliment."<br>DD already pointed out that you read the opposite of what I wrote, but the interpretation you give to this misreading could not be further from reality.  If you think you are racing ahead, perhaps you are running in the wrong direction.<br></p>

Look at Genesis alone, Pb, as William is about to do.<br><br>He makes a woman out of a man's rib. So his 'standard' is to make a woman from a man, even though the standard thereafter in nature is for a man to be made out of a woman. So nature is wrong, then? It's defying God’s law. No wonder God is crying.<br><br>He punishes a woman and all women, by multiplying their sorrow thereafter and ordering men to rule over them, because this woman ate an apple. Strewth!  What a standard! Let’s punish all men for one woman’s fruit fancy!<br><br>Then he saw man's wickedness, whatever it was, and decided to punish all men by destroying them in a massive flood, apart from the family of Noah, who was a just man. How on earth this one just man survived long enough to be saved for the ark is a mystery in itself, let alone the familiar problems of how the eight people and two of every living thing survived on the boat. But, Pb, think on this: what sort of a God would sadistically and cruelly destroy all his creation bar a few just because they didn't turn out the way he wanted? Could he not even have just put them to sleep? Why drown the lot in a huge flood? And why all the other animals as well? Weren't they blameless? Are these standards worth living up to?<br><br>But his destructiveness hasn't finished yet. For next comes Sodom and Gomorrah, rained on from heaven with brimstone and fire, not to mention Lot's wife, who is turned into a pillar of salt for looking back at the fireworks as she flees the stricken city.<br><br>And then comes more destructiveness. He tells Abraham to take his only son Isaac to the land of Moriah and offer him for a burnt offering on one of its mountains. Abraham complies, but as he is taking up the knife to slay his son, God says: "Ok, you passed my test. Sacrifice a ram instead" (poor ram, I say, what did it do to deserve this fate?). What kind of moral standard is this to ask someone to sacrifice their loved one as a test of his faith? A pretty sick joke, if you ask me. <br><br>These are only the first 22 chapters of Genesis. I haven't reached the slaughtering of the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (see Exodus 34: 13-17), the Midianites (Numbers), the unfortunate Amalekites (Exodus, Deut. Numbers, etc. etc) and the genocide conducted by Joshua.<br><br>These, Pb, are God’s standards as recorded in the Bible. If you think the writers are wrong, and were making it up, then where is God in this story?<br><br><br><br><br></p>

Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.'<br><br>So what is Abraham learning? Could it be that Abraham is learning that this God does not demand that humans provide their own sacrifice as an atonement for sin, but rather, that He Himself will be propitiation for the sins of the world. <br><br>Is that, in any way, a *possible* interpretation?<br><br></p>

However you refuse to do this with any integrity and retreat to the "shant - I'm just right cos I said so position".<br><br>It appears to me that while I acknowledge my fallible knowledge on everything the athiests are the ones here who more easily pronounce their absolute knowledge on all matters, with neer a shred of doubt.<br><br>So I do maintain my accusations of violent prejudice and bias to those who leap to make fundamentialist interpretations on scripture and refuse all reasonable discussion of context, original language and culture.<br><br>You have every right to repeat that to me if you think I am using another passage in my favour or course, and doubtless you will, and will be justified.<br><br>I am easily open to that accountability, even from athiests.<br><br><br><br>On the one hand you say that progressive revelation disproves the bible is God's word, but I dont consider that you have proven your case.<br><br>This is and always has been a central tenet of the faith. Hebrews, Romans, Galations and also Christ's teaching on divorce.<br><br>There are of course common values which are restated throughout the old and new testament of course.<br><br><br>The other obvious point is that the question posed by this thread is not "Does God exist and is the bible his word?"<br><br>No, the question is, is religion a social evil.<br><br>Have you any evidence that Deut 21 every caused social evil? where? when? how? to what extent? to what extent was the law ever used and could it be that it was delierbatly framed to discourage its use, as many commentators suggest?<br><br>How many battlefield rapes did it stop, as it was designed to do?<br><br>It is perfectly feasible for a complete athiest to argue that religion in the broadest sense gives social cohesion, stability and community and in particular Christian faith.<br><br>I would certainly agree that "religion" has many negative aspects in history.<br><br>But a casual reading of the facts in recent days affirms that the church has been responsible for the foundations of western morality, culture and law (common law); and the drive throughought the world towards organised public healthcare, education, welfare, the global abolition of slavery, third world aid, and care for those in extreme poverty. <br><br><br>I am not saying secularists made no contribution to modern life nor that ancient cultures had their own healt and edcuation systems etc. but it does appear quite factual that the foundations of the systems we now enjoy in these times were laid by churches and later adopted by the state to some extent.<br><br>eg how may of the worlds top universities and hospitals where founded by churches?<br><br><br><br>So perhaps just about every social good and thought of morality that western athiests enjoy can be traced back very easily to the bible and the church.<br><br>And best of all, as far as this thread goes, none of this even requires a belief in God or the bible as his word.<br><br>It is simply historical fact.<br><br>And this being the case, non-plussed, the track record of such faith in making such desireable western society in terms of quality of life and human rights is (ironically) a very strong argument indeed towards it actually being from God, IMHO.<br><br><br>It certainly makes for stable and workable society and therefore has reasonable precedent in a conservative approach to law making, as opposed to radical secularism.<br><br>Pick a radical law and see what precedent and context it had in ancient history to see if it is good for our society today, I suggest. <br><br>I suggest you are on a hiding to nothing if you try this, but be my guest.<br><br><br>Because I can see subtelty in scripture and because I know it is not always precise do not mean I think it is not divine or accurate.<br><br>And I think my critiquie of Christian culture and yet still having a strong faith is rather a credit to such faith than a reason to scorn it.<br><br>Never do I see athiests attempt such self examination on this blog, I note.<br><br>Again, I say it is pure laziness to say that differing views and interpretations of Christian faith through history discredits the faith; what has been held in common is by far the major part of the story.<br><br>Again, I say there is no evidence from you that you have seriously attempted to examine in your own time that which you profess to honestly test, but which I suggest you simply wish to reject.<br><br>Foir example, you speak conclusively of "genocide" when we talk of God's judgement against nations which were burning their babies alive to demons, which were sexually abusing animals, practising incest and communing with demons.<br><br>You conveniently ignore the question as to how you would have dealth with any of these problems in the region.<br><br>But your easy and absolute conclusion on the matter (genocide) does indeed betray a violent prejudice and closed mind when you come to discuss the matter.<br><br>Lastly, you will note that in judeo-christian thought there is no distinction between sacred and secualr and therefore it is quite legitimate to consider my views have political implications.<br><br>This is a norm through many cultures though history and jarrs with your enlightment approach.<br><br>Your views on God and his laws eqaully inform your own views and to prescribe how I should form mine would of course be a form of moral imposition in itself.<br><br>I assert again that it most certainly is rushing to judgement if you are asserting that you most certainly have a complete understanding of what the passage in deut 21 really means.<br><br>This is self evident, imho.<br><br>You show no evidence nor interest in examining the context of the passage, other related passages in different books or chapters or the cultural meaning of actions described which have no obvious parallel in modern western culture.<br><br>That is most certainly rushing to judgement and evidence of violent prejudice against the text.<br><br>But more importantly, the burden of evidence of what the church has done to create civilised modern society in education, health, law and culture is a mountain compared to the pebble you are jumping up and down and shouting about ie deut 21.<br><br>If the question really is, is the christian religion a form of social evil, I think the answer must be no if it is made on the basis of a sweep of history and the broad activities of Christian churches today.<br><br><br>I dont consider that any serious case has yet been made on this thread that the overall contribution of the church to history has been social evil. It is quite ridiculous.<br><br>But I throw down the gauntlet and challenege anyone so to demonstrate.<br><br><br>OriginalPB<br></p>

And if athiesm truly wishes to refute and reject the historical and current contributions of Christianity to social care and good, arguably the root of all social care/good in western civilistion, then it is not a difficult conclusion to reach that athiesm is the stark social evil in our midst. If Christian faith has consistently been the root and inspiration of such good and athiesm has little or no track record in these matters, except to oppose Christian faith then what a disaster it will be for society and what a measure of self-judgement and destruction it will be if our society tries to root out and destroy such benevolent faith from its midst.<br><br>PB<br><br></p>

While nobody can deny that atrocities have been committed in the name of Christ, can anyone seriously argue that these were a fair reflection of his life and teaching, or that they have done anything to seriously challenge the inestimable contribution to all aspects of social good across the globe that churches have made through history and still do today?<br><br><br>Following are extracts from the following article in Enc Brit entitled;<br><br>"Christianity; The Christian community and the world; The relationships of Christianity; Historical views"<br><br>In summary the article states that schools, Universities, hospitals, international aid, abolition of slavery, scientific revolution, orphanages, care of the poor, pastoral care, <br><br><br><br>Overseas aid;-<br>"Under the leadership of an American Baptist theologian, Walter Rauschenbusch (1861-1918), the so-called  Social Gospel movement spread in the Anglo-Saxon countries. A corresponding movement was started with the Christian social conferences by German Protestant theologians, such as Paul Martin Rade (1857-1940) of Marburg. The basic idea of the Social Gospel-i.e., the emphasis on the social-ethical tasks of the church-gained widespread influence within the ecumenical movement and especially affected Christian world missions. <br><br>"In many respects modern economic and other forms of aid to developing countries-including significant ecumenical contributions from the World Council of Churches, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, and the Roman Catholic Church-have now succeeded the Social Gospel."<br><br><br><br>Slavery;<br>Affirms that slavery was overcome by Paul's writings in the early church and outlines in some detail the fight of Christian church across the world against slavery since 16th century, not shirking from South Africa and US slavery, racial abuses. Cites Luther King and AB Tutu as examples of church fight in this field.<br><br><br>"The fight against slavery has passed through many controversial phases in the history of Christianity.  Paul recommended to Philemon that he accept back his runaway slave Onesimus, “nolonger as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother . . . both in the flesh and in the Lord” (verse 16). Although the biblical writings made no direct attack upon the ancient world's institution of slavery, its proleptic abolition in community with Christ-“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” ( Galatians 3:28)-has been a judgment upon the world's and the Christian community's failure to overcome slavery and all forms of oppression."  <br><br><br><br><br>Education;-<br>"The Christian Church created the bases of the Western  system of education....<br>...Only in the 18th century did the school system start to separate itself from its Christian roots and fall more and more under state control....The Christian system of education led to the early founding of universities.

As  cities developed into political corporations, a new element entered welfare work: an organizing citizenry. Through their town councils, citizens began to claim the authority to administer the ecclesiastical welfare work of hospitals and poor relief. The process was accelerated by the  Reformers, whose theology undercut the medieval idealization of poverty..."<br><br><br><br>Science;-<br>"The biblical faith in God as Creator and incarnate Redeemer is an explicit affirmation of the goodness, reality, and contingency of the created world-assumptions underlying scientific work. Thus, in the 20th century,  William Temple, archbishop of Canterbury, could assert that Christianity is an avowedly materialistic religion. Positive tendencies concerning education and science have always been dominant in the history of Christianity, even though the opposite attitude arose occasionally during certain periods.

Make your mind up. You tell others off for their take on the subject and then proceed to adopt the same take yourself. The christian religion is not the only religion in the world, and it is also bigger than the churches, though they are organisations which form part of it. Sometimes, you refer to religion, sometimes to 'churches' in the plural and at others to 'the church'. Which is it? Are they all equally guiltless? <br><br>Your are quite right about atheism. It has no morality because it has no beliefs. Atheism is defined as the absence of belief in a god or gods, nothing more or less. The same would apply to agnosticism and scepticism. But, please, get this into your head, Pb. Are you paying attention? In the past, these opinions were not organised at all. Indeed, it was dangerous even to express them because the religious, Pb, were not exactly a tolerant lot. You might get burned at the stake like Bruno or tortured like Galileo.<br><br>Even today these opinions are not generally organised. There are millions of atheists who are not joiners, who do not want their various and diverse opinions organised into a collective which might impose some beliefs on them. Instead, they join other groups as appropriate. Thus they might belong to a political party and work through it, or a trade union or pressure group such as Amnesty or Friends of the Earth etc. Or they might even work in a caring capacity for state authorities. <br><br>So when you compare 'religion' with 'atheism' it is a totally meaningless comparision because you are not comparing like with like (some atheists might even say they are religious if by this you mean having a sense of awe at the wonders of the universe). Religion covers (or at least in your thinking it does) not only a set of beliefs but also the organisations which seek to spread those beliefs.<br><br>Humanism, unlike atheism or agnosticism, does seek to develop a positive philosophy (therefore one can be both an atheist or an agnostic and a humanist) and does try to organise, but it lacks the resources that the churches have had. A potential difficulty Humanism has is that once it goes behold a statement of general principles, there will be disagreements about specifics. This is inevitable as humanists, athests etc. are by their nature freethinkers and resent being told what their opinions should be by others. Indeed, this is a good thing. So, I hope, we applaud and celebrate our differences of opinion. I hope that humanist organisations would welcome people who are left and right, liberal and conservative, unionist and republican, pro and anti-Belfast Pride and that they would be happy to express these differences to one another and in public. There is no party line or unanimity to be defended. But we are all highly moral individuals with a strong sense of right and wrong. We may not agree on some of these questions but we always approach them with thought and consideration for others.<br><br>You are quite wrong in saying that humanism teaches no care for one's neighbour as you would wish to be cared for. I've had this out with you before and pointed out that the Golden Rule as expressed in this form predates Jesus and comes from humanists such as Confucius and the Buddha. Many of the early humanists before Jesus were also heavily involved as teachers in ancient Greece and played a big part in the spead of education, as did the Renaissaance humanists and many others since.<br><br>But if you want a sweep of history, well here it is. Frederick II wrote: "The world has been deceived by three impostors, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed". The first impostor was Moses. He almost certainly never existed. The traditional version of the Ten Commandments as given In Exodus was a late invention created no earlier than the seventh century BC (we shall omit Mohammed but if you like we could discuss Islam and its impact on the world).<br><br>The emperor Constantine  made Christianity legal in 313 AD. As Bury says (History of Freedom of Thought), "this momentous decision inaugurated a millennium in which reason was enchained, thought was enslaved, and knowledge made no progress". During the two centuries in which they had been a forbidden sect the Christians had claimed toleration on the ground that religious belief is voluntary and therefore unenforceable. Now that it had the power of the state behind it, they abandoned this view and sought to create a complete uniformity of opinion. Salvation was to be found exclusively in the Christian Church. It was a 'Christian' duty to impose the only true doctrine and thus save souls from damnation. In the words of St Augustine (died 430 AD) persecution was necessary to 'compel them to come in'.<br><br>PB, I suggest you read The Closing of the Western Mind by Charles Freeman. He says that the Greek tradition of rational thought was destroyed by Christianity. BTW, he also writes  that Christians from the 4th century on accepted slavery as part of normal life and wealthier Christians owned slaves themselves. (he quotes Ephesians 6:5-7: "Slaves, be obedient to the men who are called your masters...").<br><br>At the same time, the myth itself was broadened and fortified. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD decided to replace the myth of the Jewish Messiah by an even more fantastic claim that Jesus was God incarnate.<br><br>The millennium of Christianity triumphant was characterised by anti-intellectualism, anti-reason, anti-science, anti-feminism, anti-semitism, anti- Islamism, and slavery.  Heretics, women and Jews were killed or burnt at the stake (The Inquisition), Muslims were slaughtered on Crusades, writers and scientists like Bruno and Galileo were burnt, tortured, or humiliated.  No other religion has such a bloodstained record as Christianity.<br><br>The Renaissance, spearheaded by Christian Humanists, many of whom came into conflict with the church, brought the possibilities of emancipation from these Dark Ages of the human spirit. Christianity itself split, especially after Luther's 95 Theses of 1517, and, in 1534, Henry VIII’s rejection of papal authority. In 1545 the Council of Trent condemned Protestantism. Christians were now fighting or insulting one another, and in a few countries (notably Ireland) are still doing so. The Reformation unintentionally helped the cause of human liberty because it substituted a number of theological authorities instead of one and thus weakened religious power in general. Protestantism also promoted reason because it stressed individual conscience.<br><br>Christianity has been in slow, almost imperceptible, decline for many decades in its traditional heartland in Europe as well as in many other parts of the western world. Pews are emptying and vocations are in crisis even in 'Christian' Ireland. Religion, in the sense of worship of supernatural deities, is under relentless challenge from modern science and appears increasingly as a hangover from a more primitive past.  As societies mature and become more liberal and democratic, they put away 'childish things' and seek spirituality in the beauties and mysteries of nature and companionship with other living beings. As a philosophy of life, Christianity has nothing new to offer and is undoubtedly well past its sell-by date. Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit: requiescat in pace.  </p>

Morality has nothing to do with it. Atheists, I am sure, have lots of other beliefs AS WELL, which in their view are fully moral.<br><br>You seem obsessed with 'evil'. But then this is very 'Irish' thing, looking for evil lurking under every bush and every person who doesn't happen to share your own narrow, censorious, killjoy view of the world. You talk about the good people who do wonderful things, but your morality seems negatively obsessed with putting down 'bad things' and ;bad' people. You use the word 'atheist' as if it was some kind of recognisable poison to be exterminated. We keep trying to tell you that people who question religion have a VARIETY of opinions. Absence of a belief does not imply certainty. Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false  – we may simply have no idea whether it is true or not. So the certainty or lack of it varies from one atheist or agnostic to another. Yet you insist on lumping them all together as if they all had the same opinion. This is not very intelligent.<br><br>There are lots of good people out there, both Christian and non-Christian. Many Christians have made great contributions to the world, including Galileo, who was certainly persecuted and shown the instruments of torture. Do you deny that he was forced to recant? Do you deny that he recanted because he was afraid he would suffer the same fate as Bruno, who was burnt at the stake?<br><br>As for Moses, there is absolutely no documentation of such a character outside biblical texts, which are so unreliable about so many things e.g. the 'creation'. The onus is on YOU to give external evidence for his existence, not on me to prove a negative. Give me some real evidence that there was a Moses and I might change my mind.<br><br>QUOTE: <br><br>"If atheists cannot even get so far as to agree a statement of belief ...". <br><br>END QUOTE:<br><br>Again, this is inane. How many Christian sects are there, all disagreeing with one another? There must be thousands and thousands!! And they fight over it, whereas we humanists welcome and celebrate our disagreements as proof of our freedom of thought and common humanity.<br><br>Atheism is merely a statement of non-belief, nothing more or less. As a concept, it rejects religious belief and that is all it is concerned with. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? Humanism is, however, a positive philosophy. IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE BOTH ATHEIST, AGNOSTIC OR SCEPTICAL AND TO BE A HUMANIST!!!<br><br>Why are you so concerned with sticking labels on people and fitting them into narrow pigeon-holes? They're just a substitute for thinking. Perhaps you could try it a little instead of throwing out dubious quotes from other sources.<br></p>

Anyway.<br><br>First of all PB:<br><br>In one way PB you are right, making a scape-goat of christianity, as some contributers seem to want to do, isn't helpful. Sometimes reading this blog is like reading an anti-God rant. And I find that strange given that God isn't supposed to exist. Christians have a long and established history of influencing the world for the good.<br><br>However, I'm not sure that asking the question, "what are atheist believers doing to provide an organised response to... " is going to get us anywhere. As soon as I read it I thought, but atheism isn't a movement, it is, as Brian explains, the absence of belief, and people who disbelieve so, are involved in all aspects of life, from the mundane to the notable. The trouble with arguing form this point of view is that there are many non-believers doing many good things - fact - we ought to get over it.<br><br>What concerns me is that the reason for being a christian in the first place is not that we are in some way morally superior, but it is because we have realised that we are not perfect, far from it in fact. Christianity is not about good, better, or best people, it is rather, about flawed people needing redemption, and I for one am prepared to say that that includes me.<br><br>There is an ocean of historical evidence which points to people of all faiths, and none, doing 'good works'. The real problem here, in christian terms, is, that the God of the bible says that our good isn't good enough. If we are christians we are called to repent of our good deeds as well as our bad deeds, and that's a bit of a bombshell. Of course it doesn't mean that either believer or non-believer is to stop showing kindness. It just means that our kindness is limited and, as a result, the real call in christianity is that we are to find our identity in God rather than in the ego. <br><br>Christianity says humanity is of the utmost value *and* it says that that value is a reflection of the God of the Bible.<br><br><br><br></p>

I hope, we applaud and celebrate our differences of opinion. I hope that humanist organisations would welcome people who are left and right, liberal and conservative, unionist and republican, pro and anti-Belfast Pride and that they would be happy to express these differences to one another and in public."<br><br>Would it be possible to be a christian and a humanist? Remember I believe humanity to be of utmost value. Could I, a biblical christian, join Humani?<br><br>And so to history!<br><br>It was a pretty broad sweep! But what I found interesting was your differentiation, intentional or otherwise, between pre and post 4thC christianity. I would make a similar distinction and suggest that organised religion was the worse thing that ever happened the church. One of the problems was that christianity began to confuse the Kingdom of God and the kingdoms of this world, seeking to establish, often by force, the kingdom of heaven on earth. This was, in my view, misguided, unbiblical and just plain wrong, and we are still suffering the consequences. Did it do good too, yes, but the problem of the abuse of power remains. The reformation was, as you note, helpful in promoting freedom of thought, I would argue intentionally, however it did not go far enough, and fell into many of the same problems which it argued against. Ecclesia semper reformanda est has to all intents been forgotten.<br><br>What we ought to remember however is the almost unnoticed history of small unorganised christians, the Waldenses, the Hussites, the Paulicians or the Bogomils for example and indeed today, the tradition of unorganised followers of Jesus remains.<br><br>Just one more thing Brian. You point to the The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD and accuse it of penning myth. If 'myth' it was, And I do not believe it was, then they probably got it from Tertullian and his 'Apology' in which he writes:<br><br>"We have been taught that He proceeds forth from God, and in that procession He is generated; so that He is the Son of God, and is called God from unity of substance with God... Christ is Spirit of Spirit, and God of God, as light of light is kindled...so, that which has come forth out of God is at once God and the Son of God, and the two are one... This ray of God, then, as it was always foretold in ancient times, descending into a certain virgin, and made flesh in her womb, is in His birth God and man united." 197 - 212 AD/CE<br><br>And before that he got it from Isaiah, Matthew, Luke, and Paul.<br><br>Oh, and yes, you are right, "Christianity has nothing new to offer", as the Smyrnaeans wrote at the time of the death of Polycarp, we live 'in the reign of the Eternal King, Jesus Christ'. <br><br>They did, and we all still do.<br><br><br>requiescat in pace??<br><br><br>Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus imperat.<br><br><br></p>

Certainly. There are some. Remember what DD, Heliopolitan, Peter Klaver, nonplussed, myself and others keep repeating to Pb (although it's largely a dialogue of the deaf): labels are only tags of convenience. Far too many people read too much into them. <br><br>Humanism is a very broad 'church'. We don't have any rigid tests of suitability for membership. Basically, you're a humanist if you think you are. <br><br>In the current issue of Humanism Ireland there is an article by a Quaker who is also a humanist  and member of the HAI (he lives in Dublin).<br><br>If you look at Humani's website (contrary to Pb's typically personalising assertion, not 'my' website, nor do I maintain it) you will see a list of articles including some even by fully fledged, bible-believing (though probably liberal)<br>Christians.<br><br>I am giving my own opinions here. A basic tenet of Humanism is to value freedom of thought, and it would be a complete contradiction of this basic principle for me or anyone else to tell other humanists what they should think or say. That is one of the major 'crimes' of organised religion and why it is so bad for people. It tells them what they should think. It denies them their basic freedom as an individual to think things through for themselves.<br><br>Humanism stands for individual thought not group thought. Listening to the news yesterday and hearing that all the four main parties oppose abortion in NI made me really depressed. Is there no major politician who can actually think for themselves on this issue? Can't they see that their narrow patriarchal morality is the laughing stock of Europe? As they so blind to their own petty insularity that they are prepared to elevate a foetus above the rights of a real human being?<br><br>Yet I suppose we have to remember that, again in typically Irish logic fashion, some of us spent 30 years in a futile orgy of destruction, preaching hatred and intolerance and bombing and shooting one another and killing 3,000 people in defence of human rights too!<br><br>Let me quote Robert Ingersoll, a great American humanist:<br><br>1. "We need men with moral courage to speak and write their real thoughts, and to stand by their convictions, even to the very death".<br><br>2. "The man who does not do his own thinking is a slave, and is a traitor to himself and to his fellow men".<br><br>3. "The moment you introduce a despotism in the world of thought, you succeed in making hypocrites  – and you get in such a position that you never know what your neighbour thinks".<br><br>4. "Intellectual liberty is the air of the soul, the sunshine of the mind and without it, the world is a prison, the Universe is a dungeon".<br><br>5. "I will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me. If they hold thought to be dangerous -  if they aver that doubt is a crime, then I attack them one and all, because they enslave the minds of men". <br><br>6. "Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul".<br><br>7. "Intellectual freedom is only the right to be honest".<br><br>8. "There can be but little liberty on earth while men worship a tyrant in heaven".<br><br><br><br><br></p>

And please explain your current position on anti-gravity and faster-than-light travel. To name just a few of the areas where you've come up with such deceitful YEC rubbish in the past and where I'm curious to learn what you think of them now. <br><br><br></p>

But you will notice that I have never once said that religion is a social evil. I don't like that word. It has connotations of  absoluteness in a world which is relative, and I don't think it is applicable to morality. Certainly, I have not argued that religion is absolutely bad. I have said that it has some good features and most Christians are good people (and so are most people). My argument throughout has been that it has done more harm than good, not that it is an 'evil'.<br><br>Would you say that atheism has any good features, Pb? Or is it totally evil? It does seem to me that you are obsessed with the concept of 'evil' and do see it lurking everywhere. This is unfair to the world. There is a lot of badness but there is a lot of goodness too. And much that is wrong is the result of stupidity, not 'evil'. For example, Seamus Mallon said that the GFA was Sunningdale for 'slow learners', and he has a good point. <br><br>MORAL THINKING<br>A humanist morality, I think, has a number of sources, religious and non-religious. The first group relate to thinking. We need to think right in order to do right. The Greeks knew this. Indeed, philosophy as the love of wisdom was really invented by the ancient Greeks.<br><br>Here are three. Think for yourself, respect truth and reason, be sceptical yet open-minded. We need to think right in order to do right. Very little of this comes from religion or, specifically in the west, Christianity. Most of it comes from pre-Christian Greek thought. Socrates is a key figure. The unexamined life is not worth living, he said, and he encouraged his students to challenge their own prejudices and ideas. Christianity, on the other hand, encourages the opposite: be as little children, don't think for yourself, follow me. Very dangerous.<br><br>Truth is important because a humanist believes that morality has to be based on the facts of human nature. There is no point in having a morality which ignores the way we are in favour of an impossible ideal. The concept of truth also springs from the Greeks. It is also present in Judaeo-Christianity ('the truth shall set you free', but its considerable supernatural baggage of virgin births, miracles, resurrections etc is in my view (and that of many others) factually untrue. Reason and logic, which were stressed by Aristotle, are necessary to think through the consequences of our actions.<br><br>RECIPROCITY<br>The Golden Rule in the form 'do unto others' or 'do not do under others', dates back to ancient China, India and Greece. Jesus repeats it. So, yes, I take this principle partly from Christianity but I also take it from Confucius, Buddha, Lao Tzu and from Epictetus, who wrote: "What you would avoid suffering yourself, seek not to impose on others". <br><br>It is an excellent guide. However, it is not an absolute. Remember what Shaw said about making allowances for differences of taste. Also note that its golden feet are firmly on humanist not religious ground, because it is based upon human and utilitarian principles not on revelations, commandments or taboos.<br><br>RESPECT LIFE AND RESPECT NATURE<br>Humanists do not say that life is sacred but we do accept the commandment ‘thou shalt not kill’ as a general rule. Some humanists are out and out pacifists (like Quakers) and others  argue that in special cases like self-defence or justified wars, it may be moral. Some humanists extend the principle to other animals and are vegetarians or vegans. In other words, they are like most Christians: there are differences of opinion. The same applies to nature. Some humanists are very strong Greens, others less so.<br><br>I should say that as far as the 10 Commandments are concerned, from number 5 on humanists would generally agree, subject to reservations and special circumstances. But generally we prefer to put our ethical principles more positively as dos rather than don’ts.<br><br><br>HAPPINESS AND WELLBEING<br>We believe that human wellbeing is preferable to human misery. This principle derives from the ancient Greeks such as Epicurus who taught that the prudent pursuit of pleasure was the main aim of life. His ideas, after a thousand and more years of the dark age of Christianity, were revived by Bentham and Mill, both atheists/agnostics, who along with Francis Hutcheson, formulated the principle of the greatest good of the greatest number, again a basic humanist tenet today. Many humanists would say that the meaning of life lies in our contribution to the happiness and wellbeing of others.<br><br>LIBERTY<br>Another principle is that people should be free to do whatever they want, provided they do not harm others. This principles derives above all from Mill and his crucial work 'On Liberty'. Humanists generally do not believe that personal morality is a proper target for the law unless one’s actions cause suffering or harm.<br><br>HUMANITY<br>Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein in their joint declaration (written by Russell and agreed by Einstein) put it thus: "remember your humanity and forget the rest". In other words, ultimately we are all equal members of the human race and should be treated as such.<br><br>In sum, Humanist morality is an eclectic amalgam of principles derived from various sources: Socrates, Epicurus, Confucius, Epictetus, Aristotle, Jesus, Bentham, Mill, Russell, Einstein, and so on. It uses the wisdom of the ages and does not depend upon one source (the Bible) which has a few good things in it but a lot of bad and is hardly a useful road map to a sophisticated and human ethic.<br><br>PS<br>What’s your point about Galileo?Do you deny that he was several times threatened with torture? Do you deny that the pope personally threatened Pico della Mirandola with burning for his Oration on the Dignity of Man in 1486? Do you deny that Campanella was imprisoned for his writings by the Inquisition for 27 years? Do you deny that Bruno was burned at the stake in the Piazza dei Fiori in Rome in 1600 because he was charged with atheism and for championing the Copernican system? Do you deny that Thomas More used an allonym in one of his writings because he feared the wrath of the Church?</p>

It is quite obvious that you have told lies and are indeed a hypocrite.<br><br>"Remeber, all those scientists you suggested I talk to.. be honest and tell that you went to them and asked for arguments to counter my discussions on QM, while admitting that you hadnt a clue what I was talking about."<br><br>More prevarication noted . You must excuse me PB if I do not take everything that you say on science at face value-given your woeful record. I am so sorry PB that I am not an expert on QM-unlike yourself of course! You who are an expert on palaeontology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, dating methods, biology, zoology etc. Indeed it is very odd with all your "knowledge" that you post on this blog and not publish your ground-breaking work, which would earn you Nobel-prizes, earn you millions and would ensure you enter the pantheon of great scientists!<br><br>"You said you knew I was completely wrong even though you hadnt a clue about the issues.<br><br>That that really is objective and evidence based inquiry isnt it?"<br><br>PB you said that "the study of QM is undermining evolution", now I may not be the expert that you are! however I do read up a bit on science(obviously I do not have the extensive evidence that you have!) and this stunning news that you gave us-I could find nowhere(and I did look before I asked scientists working in related fields-how dastardly of me!). Now I am a bit more up to speed on the issues so...<br><br>Demonstrate that you told lies in front of witnesses...ok lets take the first example.<br><br>"Current scientific assumptions (including those underpinning the evolutionist viewpoint) are increasingly being undermined by quantum science."<br><br>Now I say that this is a lie, I say that the study of QM is not undermining evolution. You demonstrate that it is-simple as that! Some peer reviewed papers would be great.<br><br>You really would think it would be simple!<br><br>"I would much prefer civil debate myself."<br><br>So would I  but...you keep making these grand claims but when asked some very simple questions to back them up...you run away!<br><br><br><br>later...<br><br>DD</p>

Please note that we are not like this with every poster..it's just you. Indeed PB it is not just the atheists but also the Christians who are turned off by your behaviour-Peter Morrow gently rebuked you for misrepresentation earlier on this thread and PTL on another thread(who is even more fundamentalist than you!) stated that he wished to distance himself from you!?<br><br>As I stated you are wilfully ignorant-you post stunning "scientific" news and then run away when asked some very *simple* questions to back up these stunning assertions you run away! Now PB this does look like you are telling lies. The solution is very *simple*-back up your myriad claims.<br><br>This is a public message board for robust discussion-if you don't like it then leave! Your behaviour illustrates your fundamentalist character eg., cut of all dissent. If you don't like these threads (and you are constantly having a go at Will Crawley) then start your own! Probably (just as with Ken Ham) everyone would of course have to agree with you.<br><br>PB I did seriously consider reporting a few of your posts on this thread(and I have never complained about a post)but I noticed on the complaints page that the mods urge you to respond to the poster first and try and work it out-which I am attempting to do-Now you made some very serious allegations against Peter. Peter did try to defend himself but you got the posts pulled. The 'crucify' charge is ridiculous and obviously to anyone with a smigden of wit a pastiche of Monty Python's 'Life Of Brian'-no-one found it offensive on the original thread just you! and was obviously not meant to be taken literally-DOH! as for the 'rape' thing-please! grow up!<br><br>Please remember PB, this is a silly little message board(no offense to Will) that in reality amounts to little more than a hill of beans. Also you have never identified yourself, we know nowt about you etc likewise with me. You have taken it all way too seriously.<br><br>Regards<br><br>DD   <br></p>
