<div class="clearboth"></div> 
      </div>      <p>Once upon a time,  strikes were a tool used by
              labor unions to advance the interests of their members and to extract
              higher wages and improved benefits. In recent decades, however,
              with unions on the defensive against increasingly aggressive corporations,
              strikes have morphed into an employer weapon. The massive four-and-a-half
              month labor dispute that just ended this week, affecting 70,000
              workers from San Luis Obispo to the Mexican border, must be understood
              in this context. </p>
            <p> Southern California's supermarkets have been unionized for more
              than half a century. Until last year, they were a poster child
              for "high road" management. Labor-management relations were cordial,
              and the industry had an unbroken record of labor peace going back
              25 years. With all the major grocery chains under the same union
              contract, paying the same wages and benefits, competition was based
              on service and quality; not on squeezing labor. The happy result
              was that supermarkets were one of the region's few remaining sources
              of middle-class jobs with decent wages and benefits for workers
              without a college degree. </p>
            <p> Last summer, however, Safeway, Albertson's and Kroger-the industry's
              Big Three-made a calculated decision to radically restructure their
              wages and benefits and, in effect, abandoned the high road. They
              demanded major concessions from the United Food and Commercial
              Workers Union (UFCW) when its southern California contracts came
              up for renewal in the fall. Among their many demands were a sharp
              reduction in employer contributions to the workers' health insurance
              plan, as well as a two-tier wage structure under which new hires
              would earn far less than their co-workers and receive vastly inferior
              health and pension benefits. As the companies knew perfectly well,
              no union worthy of the name could have accepted these concessions
              without a fight, and indeed the union declared a strike against
              Safeway (which operates as Vons in the Southland) on Oct. 11, five
              days after the old contracts expired. </p>
            <p> Strikes are the equivalent of war in the labor relations arena,
              and the employers planned their offensive like a military operation.
              When the union belatedly decided to strike only the Safeway-owned
              stores, Kroger and Albertson's immediately announced they would
              lock their workers out. All three chains meticulously prepared
              for the conflict, hiring thousands of replacement workers well
              in advance of the strike deadline, obtaining commercial drivers'
              licenses for their managers, and even recruiting truck drivers
              who could replace any Teamsters who went out on sympathy strikes.
              They entered into a pact among themselves to share any profits
              for the duration of the conflict, an arrangement whose legality
              has since been called into question. Their public relations machines
              were well oiled for the occasion as well, pouring out endless newspaper
              ads and other messages to the public to create the impression that
              their demands were modest and reasonable. </p>
            <p> The employers claimed they needed concessions from the UFCW because
              of competition from Wal-Mart, the nation's icon of low-wage retailing,
              which operates SuperStores in some parts of the country that have
              a significant share of the retail food market. But the Wal-Mart
              argument is less than compelling for the case of Southern California,
              since Wal-Mart has yet to open a single store selling groceries
              in this region. At best this was a threat on the distant horizon. </p>
            <p> Why, then, did the grocery chains choose southern California
              as the battleground for their assault on the UFCW's long-established
              wage and benefits? Perhaps it was simply a matter of timing; the
              union contracts in this region were the first to expire when these
              giant national firms made the decision to join the race to the
              bottom. Or perhaps it was the fact that the southern California
              UFCW contracts were the best (from the union's perspective) in
              the nation, and covering the largest number of workers. If the
              union could be forced into a strike here, not only would the results
              set the pattern for the rest of the nation, but the union's treasury
              might be depleted in the process. Indeed the union spent a phenomenal
              $1 million a day during the strike, and after 139 days it simply
              lacks the financial resources to fight another day. The companies
              lost a huge amount of money too-$2 billion by most accounts-but
              for them this was an investment on which the future returns would
              be well worth the price. </p>
            <p> Yet the Big Three didn't hold all the cards. No one anticipated
              the huge public support the picketers garnered when they suddenly
              appeared in front of the stores where virtually everyone in the
              region buys their daily bread. Very few people crossed the picket
              lines, largely because of the personal ties between customers and
              checkers. Public support was also fueled by the anxiety so many
              working people had about being forced to absorb more and more of
              the costs of health insurance at their own jobs (if they were lucky
              enough to be insured), for this initially appeared to be the main
              issue in the conflict. Many customers cheered on the supermarket
              workers' efforts to resist the trend toward employers forcing workers
              to absorb more and more of the rising costs of insurance. </p>
            <p> Unfortunately, the UFCW failed to capitalize on the enormous
              public sympathy the picketers evoked. In retrospect it's clear
              that they did not realize the enormity of the challenge they were
              up against until very late in the process. Twenty-five years of
              labor peace left them poorly prepared for war. Their own members
              entered the fray with only limited information about the strike
              issues, and equally important, the union failed to communicate
              effectively with the wider public until several months had elapsed.
              The UFCW, as a traditional "business union," was not practiced
              in the innovative tactics that other unions have developed to effectively
              confront employers in a hostile political and economic environment.
              And sadly, the longstanding tradition in the U.S. labor movement
              of decentralization and local autonomy meant that the more savvy
              unions that could have unleashed such tactics were not invited
              to help until it was much too late. </p>
            <p> As the strike and lockout dragged on, the employers proved intransigent,
              unwilling to consider more moderate offers of concessions from
              the union and unresponsive to repeated attempts to facilitate negotiations.
              Only after unfavorable quarterly profit reports generated a negative
              reaction from Wall Street, and after a desperate UFCW invited AFL-CIO
              veterans to launch more aggressive tactics and threaten to make
              the dispute national, did they finally begin bargaining in earnest. </p>
            <p> When the parties finally reached a settlement last week, the
              union publicly declared victory. UFCW International President Douglas
              Dority, who retired just a few days later, went so far as to declare
              that this was "one of the must successful strikes in history." The
              union pointed to the fact that the settlement succeeded in preserving
              the established health insurance system for current workers for
              two more years, which was one of the central issues that led to
              the strike and lockout. </p>
            <p> But in every other respect, the employers were the real winners
              here. They accomplished their primary goal, which was to impose
              a two-tier system that provides dramatically inferior pay, health
              insurance and other benefits for any workers hired in the region's
              supermarkets after Oct. 6, 2003 (the expiration date of the last
              union contract). Given normal turnover, in a few years, the majority
              of the workers in the region's supermarkets will be in the new,
              bottom tier-even if most of the 70,000 workers who struck or were
              locked out return to work. And store managers will have every incentive
              to accelerate this transition, since their labor costs will be
              so much higher for workers in the upper tier. The strike settlement
              will also become the template for future labor negotiations in
              the supermarket industry all over the nation, as regional contracts
              between "Big Three" grocery chains and the UFCW come up for renewal
              over the months and years to come. There may be ripple effects
              on labor negotiations in other industries as well.</p>
            <p> The 2003-04
                Southern California supermarket strike and lockout will be remembered
                as a turning point in corporate America's tragic journey down
              the low road, and as a huge defeat for the U.S. labor movement
              and for working people. One can only hope that next time, the unions
                will be better prepared for battle. </p>
