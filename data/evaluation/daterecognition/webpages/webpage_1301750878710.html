<H3><A NAME="cni">COALITION FOR NETWORKED INFORMATION</A></H3> 

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.cni.org/ ">Coalition for Networked Information</A> was founded in March 1990 to promote 

the creation and use of networked information resources and services that advance 

scholarship and intellectual productivity.  The Coalition is a joint project of the 

Association of Research Libraries (ARL), CAUSE (see below), and Educom.  A task force 

of over 200 institutions and organisations provides the Coalition with insights, 

initiatives, and resources to pursue its mission.  Members of the task force include 

higher education institutions, publishers, network service providers, computer companies,

 library networks and organisations, and public and state libraries.  It is a truly 

diverse partnership of institutions and organisations with a common interest in 

realising the promise of networked information resources and services.



<H3><A NAME="cause">CAUSE</A></H3> 

<P>CAUSE is the association for managing and using information resources in higher education.  

An international non-profit association, CAUSE's mission is to enable the transformational changes 

occurring in higher education through the effective management and use of information resources 

- technology, services, and information.  The CAUSE membership includes more than 1,300 campuses and 

other educational organisations from all regions of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and several 

other countries - as well as 73 corporate members.  Nearly 3,700 individuals participate in CAUSE 

as member representatives from their institutions.



<H3><A NAME="bl">THE BRITISH LIBRARY</A></H3> 

<P>The British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom, and contains over one hundred and fifty 

million items representing every age of written civilisation.  The British Library exists to serve scholarship, 

research and innovation.  It is the national archive of monographs and serials received by legal deposit.  

It provides Reading Room and enquiry services, as well as a range of document supply services for remote users.  

The Library's Initiatives for Access programme is looking at how new digital and networking technologies can 

expand the use of its rich collections.



<P>The British Library Research and Development Department is the main UK funding agency for research in 

the library and information field.  It supports and disseminates the results of a wide range of projects.  

The Department has a number of other activities, including administering grants for cataloguing and preservation, 

research in the book world and special initiatives for the Department of National Heritage.



<H3><A NAME="jisc">JOINT INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMMITTEE</A></H3> 



<P>The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) was established on 1 April 1993 by the Higher Education 

Funding Councils for England, Scotland and Wales, and is now also supported by the Department of Education for 

Northern Ireland (DENI).  The mission for JISC is "to stimulate and enable the cost effective exploitation of 

information systems and to provide a high quality national infrastructure for the UK higher education and research 

councils' communities".



<P>The main objectives of JISC are:

<UL>

<LI>to exercise vision and leadership in bringing about benefits to the higher education sector by the exploitation of information systems;

<LI>to ensure the provision of a pervasive network infrastructure to the higher education and research councils' communities;

<LI>to ensure the provision of central data services where this is sensible on economic grounds;

<LI>to promote the exploitation of new technologies as a service provision to the higher education community;

<LI>to encourage and facilitate the development of information strategies in the higher education community.

</UL>





<H3><A NAME="ukoln">UKOLN</A></H3> 

<P>The UK Office for Library and Information Networking (UKOLN) and its antecedent organisations have been based at 

the University of Bath for the last 18 years.  It supports the UK library and information communities through research, 

co-ordination and awareness, and information services in the area of network information management.  It has 

recently expanded and developed a work programme around distributed library and information systems, resource discovery 

and metadata, bibliographic management and public library networking.  At the same time it is expanding its network 

information and event organisation services.  UKOLN is funded by the British Library Research and Development Department 

and by JISC.  Further information about UKOLN and its activities can be found at URL: <A HREF="http://ukoln.bath.ac.uk">http://ukoln.bath.ac.uk</A>

<H1><A NAME="summary">CONFERENCE SUMMARY</A></H1> 



<H3>MARC FRESKO, Principal, The Marc Fresko Consultancy</H3> 



<H3>Background</H3> 



<P>As Sir Brian Follett reminds us in his opening presentation, the bits and bytes which constitute networked 

information are no respecters of international boundaries.  Any issues concerning the effective use of 

network-based information or resources truly are best dealt with internationally; and there is no 

shortage of issues.  This conference confirmed the high level of interest in issues to do with production, 

distribution, management and preservation of digital resources; and that there is a strong desire to identify, 

face and overcome these issues.  Fortunately, the wish to resolve such problems is as international as the 

problems. As Lynne Brindley pointed out in her welcoming address, the significance of the event was marked 

symbolically in two ways: first by the international connotations of the venue, Heathrow; and second by the 

integrative nature of the programme being represented by the sponsorship of the event by five leading institutions: 

The British Library, CNI, CAUSE and JISC.



<H3>The conference presentations</H3> 



<P>The main part of the conference consisted of 18 formal presentations (see Annex 1 for the complete programme).  

Four were on general topics, giving perspectives of some important developments in the UK and the complex and 

changing cost modelling issues which concern us all. The other presentations described a varied sample of specific 

projects.  The projects cover a range of subjects; they are grouped under the following five headings:

<UL>

<LI>the development of electronic journals (exploring the multitude of cost, technical and organisational questions they raise);

<LI>teaching and learning initiatives (demonstrating some of the approaches which can be used inside and outside the academic community);

<LI>management and service issues (exploring the relationships between information science and other disciplines, and describing an adventurous proposition for new services);

<LI>networked information discovery and retrieval issues (examples of projects in implementation and research  on futures and trends);

<LI>specific technical concerns (describing a novel model for networked scholarly communication, and, in complete contrast, explaining how networked information can encompass administrative systems).

</UL>



<P>The presentations, and the conference as a whole, was marked by impressively high levels of energy and participation, 

as Paul Evan Peters remarked.  I hope that this report conveys the sense of excitement and progress which was evident 

during the conference.



<H3>About this report</H3> 



<P>The remainder of this report consists primarily of accounts of the conference presentations. The accounts were 

prepared by consultants.  They are not formal papers written by the speakers, though in many cases notes, slides 

and other materials were provided by the speakers.  In all cases, speakers were offered the opportunity to review 

the account of their presentation.



<P>In keeping with its subject matter, the organisers have decided to publish this report primarily on the Internet 

rather than on paper.  This has the benefit of allowing us to represent speakers' references by means of hyperlinks 

rather than by mere static footnotes on paper.  As some of the references will evolve during the period in which this 

report is of interest, this adds value by ensuring that the most up to date material is available.  Of course, there 

is an accompanying potential disadvantage, namely that some of the referenced material will be taken off the network 

or will be moved to a different URL; an apposite illustration of one of the significant issues facing users of 

networked information!



<H3>The Future</H3> 



<P>The use of networks, and the amount of information on the Internet is growing very rapidly; by some measures 

at a rate which is more than logarithmic <A HREF="uk-9602-report.html#fn1"> [1]</A> .  There is general agreement that scholarly resources are used 

internationally.  However, it is notable that although many projects and initiatives presented at the conference 

could have world-wide relevance, interest and impact, the majority are essentially national in their organisation.  

This underlines the importance of an international event such as this conference; it provided a  valuable opportunity 

for practitioners from several countries to share experiences.  Paul Evan Peters expressed, in the closing session, 

the hope that the discussions which took place might give rise to joint initiatives building on the strengths of the 

existing national projects; this conference was one way in which synergy can usefully be encouraged , and others 

should actively be sought in order to maximise and distribute the benefits of work in this field.



<H3>Acknowledgements</H3> 



<P>Finally, I want to express thanks to the speakers who all tolerantly supplied notes, slides and other materials 

to help generate this report.  I hope that they find their ideas are expressed accurately, and that they will 

forgive any omissions by abbreviation.  Thanks are also due to my colleague Mike Arblaster, who assisted in the 

preparation of several of the accounts; to Isobel Stark, who applied the HTML tags; and to Hazel Gott of UKOLN 

who, as chief organiser of this conference, patiently contended with a stream of requests for details and 

clarifications during the preparation of this report.

<H1><A NAME="follet"> UNIVERSITIES LIBRARIES REVIEW GROUP, TWO YEARS ON:

ACHIEVEMENTS, PLANS AND PROBLEMS</A></H1> 



<H3>SIR BRIAN FOLLETT, Vice-Chancellor, University of Warwick</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was prepared for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is an edited version of a paper supplied by the speaker.</EM> 

<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 

<P>This presentation starts by covering some of the background to the University Libraries Review.  

Next it examines some of the follow-up activities resulting from the Libraries review focusing 

especially on the Electronic Libraries Programme (eLib) and the Anderson report.  It concludes with 

a brief look at future hopes for the programme.</P> 



<H2>INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT</H2> 

<p>This paper is presented in the context of an international conference.  Development of the Electronic Library 

(or the Digital Library) must be an international activity.  Individuals need passports and visas to get into 

or out of Britain.  Our goods and chattels need customs clearances.  But our bits and bytes respect no formalities, 

going where we send them, and sometimes where we do not.  Our laws and our institutions are territorial, bits and 

bytes are not.  We must work together to ensure we can understand and use them.</P> 



<P><CITE>Ariadne</CITE>, a new electronic journal for libraries, was launched earlier this year in the UK.  

The original Ariadne, daughter of a king of Crete, features in a mythological tale which involves Theseus.  

In this tale, Theseus gratefully uses information supplied by Ariadne to find his way through the Minotaur's 

labyrinth, but he later is unwilling to pay the price, and abandons Ariadne. Vice-Chancellors and Funding Council 

members might sometimes be compared with Theseus, having often been viewed as unwilling to pay the price to maintain 

university libraries.  The launch of Ariadne, however, signifies that they are prepared to pay their share, as 

explained below.</P> 



<H2>BACKGROUND</H2> 



<P>In 1992 the newly formed Higher Education Funding Councils asked the speaker to chair an enquiry into 

libraries in higher education.  At that time universities were in a time of tremendous expansion.  

The number of students in UK universities increased by 57&#37; between 1988 and 1992.  This was very welcome, 

but it exacerbated the pressures for university libraries, for during this period, library provision increased 

very little.  How could we support these students?  At the same time, the ex-polytechnics became universities.  

How could they meet their research aspirations without research libraries?  Meanwhile, the infamous journals price 

spiral was threatening research collections even in well-established universities.</P> 



<P>The review group decided to report quickly and pragmatically, rather than going back to basics.  After 12 

months work by the Review group and its 3 sub-groups, it reported in November 1993 with what has become known 

as the <A
HREF="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/follett/follett_report.html">Follett
Report</A>. It came up with 46 recommendations to the 

Funding Councils covering virtually all parts of the library from space issues to the electronic future.</P> 



<P>The four higher education funding councils accepted virtually all the recommendations, turning down only one: 

funds for inter-library co-operation.  In all they set aside close to �100 million for implementation, and we have 

been very busy over the last two years.  HEFCE "believes the report was a very successful document, suggesting 

pragmatic solutions for some of the major issues facing UK HE libraries".  The speaker suggests it worked because 

the report not only identified an area of worrying neglect but also offered some practical solutions.  The outcomes 

of the report are described below.</P> 



<H2>OUTCOMES</H2> 



<H3>Buildings Programme</H3> 



<P>Perhaps the most visible and enduring result of the report will be the buildings programme.  

Across the country about &#163;200 million was spent on 70 projects (about &#163;150M from universities plus about 

&#163;50M from the funding councils).  This will produce spaces for about 250,000 readers, many IT-equipped, in 70 

institutions.  The first of these, in Southampton, is to open officially in March 1996.</P> 



<H3>Special Collections and Archives</H3> 



<P>The Review concentrated internationally on Arts and Humanities subjects; the focus was small to ensure that 

the results would be valid.  Many libraries contain special collections of great importance to researchers in the 

humanities, but which are not widely known.  In this part of the programme, we are funding projects to conserve, 

catalogue and preserve some of these collections.  We will also do work on making information on archives accessible 

over the network.</P> 



<P>The total cost of this over 5 years comes to &#163;32 million.  There is a provision to review the programme 

after 3 years, since many important collections are still not being funded.</P> 



<H3>National Journals Site Licensing Pilot</H3> 



<P>As mentioned above, the journals price spiral was one of the motivators for the Review.  One of the options 

explored was for the licensing of copyright material under more favourable conditions.  This would include unlimited 

copying on site, including for course packs, as well as electronic access.</P> 



<P>The funding councils agreed to set up a UK-wide Pilot Site Licence initiative for three years starting in 

January 1996. The publishers selected for the pilot include Academic Press, Blackwells Publishing, Blackwells 

Science and Institute of Physics Publishing. In exchange for a central payment by the funding bodies, all the 

journals would be made available in both print and electronic form at a substantial discount.  This initiative 

has a particularly democratic aspect: all universities, old and new, will have the same access.</P> 



<P>This has been one of the most controversial proposals.  The funding councils were rather sceptical.  

Librarians have been extremely suspicious.  Publishers not involved are furious about it.</P> 



<P>Final negotiations have proved very difficult.  Undoubtedly there will be problems, and it may well 

not be the right way to go. But it is worth a try.  Let this pilot be used to find out what the pros and cons 

really are. </P>



<H3>Copyright</H3> 



<P>Problems of copyright raise difficult and controversial issues.</P> 



<P>We were extremely encouraged by the reports from the AAU/ARL working parties on intellectual property 

that came out last year.  We hoped for a while that if we in the UK also took a similar line, that we might 

be able to do something about the copyright paradox.  That is, universities paying to create the work, 

giving it away, then paying publishers again to buy it back for our libraries.</P> 



<P>The speaker visited the AAU in May last year with two colleagues.  It was clear from that visit that both 

sides of the Atlantic are finding these issues intractable.   It is a difficult area for university Presidents 

or Vice-Chancellors to take concerted action.  We need a continuing dialogue with our American colleagues.   

I strongly doubt that CVCP (Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals) can take effective action on its 

own so we need some sort of forum for international action.</P> 



<P>Given this lack of progress , the publishers still have us over a barrel.  It is crucial that arrangements 

are made that recognise the delicate economic balance that exists between players in the HE community.  

If this is not recognised, universities and academics are very likely to by-pass traditional scholarly 

communications methods altogether.</P> 



<P>Recently, things seem to have got worse, with the publication in the US of the White Paper on Copyright 

and the NII. This report appears highly oriented towards the rights holders and away from the traditional 

balance of copyright.  We are very concerned that the proposed legislation in the US should not form a 

precedent for other parts of the world.</P> 



<P>We have recently published a collection of papers on copyright, on the network as well as in print.  

As usual, this collection provides more questions than answers.</P> 



<H2>IT ACTIVITIES: JISC</H2> 



<P>Most IT-related activities of these took place under the aegis of the Joint Information Systems 

Committee, otherwise known as JISC.</P> 



<P>JISC's main role is to organise JANET/SuperJANET, our academic network, but it already had a 

substantial programme funding datasets and datacentres.  An early endeavour was BIDS, which started 

with the national site licence for the ISI database several years ago.  Next came MIDAS, hosting 

statistical and similar datasets, and more recently EDINA, a second site for bibliographic and other datasets.</P> 



<H3>Arts and Humanities Data Service</H3> 



<P>JISC recommended that funds should be provided to establish an Arts & Humanities Data Service (AHDS).  

This will be a distributed service, with an executive based at King's College, London and headed by Dan Greenstein.  

The resources provided will be hosted by the universities where they originated, and where the expertise to maintain 

them lies.  This corresponds to a "classical" digital libraries format, where materials remain in universities and 

are accessed by Internet.</P> 



<P>We expect that a significant component of these resources will be images, and will be linked to other work 

relating to images in the electronic libraries programme.</P> 



<H3>CURL Database Extensions</H3> 



<P>The Consortium of University Research Libraries (CURL, a group of a dozen or so of our larger university 

libraries) has for years been bringing together the bibliographic databases from its members.  However, the 

resulting database needed a lot of work.  We persuaded the funding councils to provide funds for the development 

of this database as a national resource, with an associated document delivery service.  This work is underway at 

Manchester.</P> 



<H3>Retrospective Conversion Study</H3> 



<P>We wanted to know if a major national retrospective catalogue conversion programme was justified.  

The report we commissioned is quite convincing on the benefits of that conversion.  We have about 11 

million records in electronic form in our university libraries.  We need to convert over 25 million more.  

In theory this means that more than two thirds of the material in our libraries can be discovered only by 

inspecting card or other hard copy catalogues.</P> 



<P>The problem is the cost.  This is estimated at �50 million, made up of �25 million from central sources 

plus matching funding from the universities.  This is going to be difficult to fund given the funding pressures 

and we are not sure how to cope with this, beyond spending a small amount each year attacking key parts of the 

problem.  One thing is certain: decisions of this nature need to be linked to a national strategy.  Initiatives in 

this area will give shape to prioritising collections for conversion and help to emphasise collections of national 

significance.</P> 



<H2>ELECTRONIC LIBRARIES PROGRAMME</H2> 



<P>Now we come to one of the most significant developments, the Electronic Libraries Programme, eLib 

(a digital libraries programme as it might be called in the United States).</P> 



<P>eLib is managed by an Implementation Group for IT (FIGIT), chaired by Lynne Brindley. FIGIT is a 

sub-committee of the JISC.  The programme is directed by Chris Rusbridge, who has chosen to base himself at 

Warwick, where he is supported by Kelly Russell.</P> 



<P>FIGIT has released two calls for proposals: one in July 1994 and one in November 1995.  The initial call 

was divided into seven programme areas, and the second call into four areas.</P> 



<P>Elib projects are quite different from the NSF/NASA/ARPA digital library projects.  These are six huge, 

integrated projects each looking at many different aspects of the digital library.  In contrast eLib, about the 

same size in cash terms, has funded over 50 projects to date.  These are mostly small  - aiming for deliverables 

over the next three years or so.  The projects involve more than 85 different HE institutions.  Overall it is a 

pragmatic programme, with relatively short term projects.  With this scope, eLib could represent an important 

step toward broad based cultural change.</P> 



<H2>FIRST CALL</H2> 



<P>The programme areas of the first call are examined below.</P> 



<H3>Document Delivery</H3> 



<P>Having concentrated in part on the arts and humanities, we also initiated document delivery projects, 

some of which are particularly relevant to science and technology.</P> 



<P>In document delivery, we aimed first of all to test different models in a networked, distributed environment.  

Most document delivery in the UK is sourced from the British Library's Document Supply Centre at Boston Spa.  

We wanted to make more use of our own resources.  LAMDA is a project using RLG's ARIEL software to undertake 

document delivery between universities in the London area and a group in Manchester.</P> 



<P>We are also funding two major systems development projects for paper-based documents.  One of these is dual 

language: English and Welsh.  We have also agreed to join with Australian and New Zealand partners to commission 

enhancements to ARIEL.  Finally in this area is the InfoBike project, which will provide document delivery from 

electronic-sourced documents.</P> 



<H3>Electronic journals</H3> 



<P>In the electronic journals area, we are funding twelve projects.  Two of these, <CITE>CLIC</CITE> and <CITE> 

Internet Archaeology</CITE>, are described in other papers in this report.  Others range from support for learned 

society publishers moving to electronic formats, to the second SuperJournal project.  This has a consortium of 20 

publishers, in various disciplines.  The project plans to test a selection of off-the-shelf interfaces, carrying 

out a series of user behaviour studies.  These studies will then be evaluated to determine the way users interact 

with clusters of journals from these publishers.</P> 



<H3>Digitisation</H3> 



<P>Digitisation has proved to be a difficult area, and it has taken time to clarify and develop thinking in this 

area.  We thought we might be able to release some space by digitising long runs of out-of-copyright material.  

Despite getting a good number of proposals, we have only funded two digitisation projects to date, and only one 

of these (from Oxford and Leeds) deals with early journals.  The second deals with recent journals in the area 

of design.  The motivation here is not space but conservation.  Students in this area apparently steal not just 

pages or volumes, but entire runs of journals!  We can only hope that they will not resort to stealing instead 

PCs or workstations...</P> 



<P>These modest test projects have been funded to provide experience and insight into the technological and 

economic issues of digitisation.  It seems clear now that the most appropriate model is a central digitisation 

facility (possibly in co-operation with the private sector) which would negotiate copyright clearance and 

provide off-site expert evaluation services.  We would like to fund such a centre, though it is not yet 

certain that all necessary technologies are mature enough.</P> 



<H3>On Demand Publishing</H3> 



<P>On Demand publishing is the practice of printing short runs of publications - sometimes extremely short runs 

- when they are needed, rather than the more traditional practice of printing large runs and keeping stocks awaiting 

demand.  An examination of this area shows how conservative, book-oriented, teaching is currently.</P> 



<P>On Demand Publishing is one programme area where the major emphasis throughout has been on the teaching and 

learning benefits.  We have funded seven projects.  Most have a print-on-paper emphasis, but a few, notably the 

ERIMS project in management studies and the Liverpool John Moores project in the humanities, have an electronic 

basis.  These projects are generally all having difficulties with getting publishers' rights cleared at a 

reasonable price.  Publishers seem determined to kill off a promising market.</P> 



<H3>Training and awareness</H3> 



<P>We have always believed that training and awareness is a vital area.  We have funded six projects here, 

generally quite different from one another.  Netskills is our main skills improvement project, based on 

the group at Newcastle who provided training through the Mailbase project.  We also have EduLib,  aiming 

to upgrade the educational competencies of librarians.  There are three projects which are practically based, 

but essentially studies. </P>



<P>Finally there is the recently-launched Ariadne.  This is a print and network-based newsletter which was 

initiated earlier in 1996.  It aims to stimulate discussion in the library community, and should achieve that, 

from its first issue.</P> 



<H3>Access to Network Resources</H3> 



<P>It is notoriously difficult to find resources on the Internet.  One approach we are taking is the 

creation of subject-based gateways.  Another paper in this report describes the  SOSIG gateway project; 

there are a further six gateways and one technology project in this area.</P> 





<H3>Supporting Studies</H3> 



<P>We always expected there would be useful work which was difficult to categorise.  The supporting 

studies area brings these together. We have three projects, looking at the economics of document delivery, 

at cultural change, and at problems of resource discovery (refer to the paper on ROADS herein).  There have 

also been shorter studies on existing digitisation projects, on the need for an images data service, and on 

technologies for copyright management.</P> 



<H3>Images</H3> 



<P>Images have been mentioned more than once above.  FIGIT received quite a number of image-based proposals 

in its first call but chose to wait for an images scoping study it had funded.  That document is now out for 

consultation, and FIGIT has taken it as a framework for awarding three significant projects, covering very 

different areas: digital maps, medical images and photographic images of historical interest.  These are 

very new.</P> 



<H2>SECOND CALL</H2> 



<P>The second call asked for proposals in pre-prints and grey literature, in quality assurance and in 

electronic reserve.  These areas were addressing gaps where the initial response was not felt adequate.  

Pre-prints or grey literature lend themselves particularly well to an electronic environment.  None of their 

timeliness is lost in processing or postal delays.  We have agreed four projects in this area, and this is the 

first public announcement of support for a pre-print service in the cognitive sciences, directed by Stevan Harnad.  

This is an area in which the UK may take a world-wide lead.</P> 

<P>Quality assurance projects will work to develop working models for refereeing in an electronic environment.  

The successful project is concerned more with streamlining peer review in  than new models of quality assurance.  

It could prove very complementary to work in electronic journals and pre-prints.  One can perhaps envisage 

further work on a system that moves materials directly from a pre-print via a refereeing environment into an 

e-journal.</P> 

<P>The electronic reserve projects take our on-demand publishing work one stage further.  There are some very 

interesting projects here, including some vital software for tracking access to copyright materials.  

There is also a project on delivering access to music and video as electronic reserve materials, for dance</P> 



<H3>ELIB INFORMATION</H3> 



<P>Naturally, there are numerous sources of information about eLib:</P> 

<UL>

<LI>information packs, available on request from JISC;

<LI>eLib's WWW pages at URL <A HREF="http://ukoln.bath.ac.uk/elib/">http://ukoln.bath.ac.uk/elib/</A> 

<LI>Ariadne, at URL <A HREF="http://ukoln.bath.ac.uk/ariadne/">http://ukoln.bath.ac.uk/ariadne/</A> 

<LI>Mailbase mailing list  <A HREF="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists-k-o/lis-elib/">lis-elib@mailbase.ac.uk</A> 

</UL>



<P>A famous British writer, Terry Pratchett, has written a whole series of science fiction stories 

about his imaginary Discworld.  This world has many extraordinary parallels with our own.  In these stories, 

the Librarian at the Unseen University has been changed through some unfortunate magical accident to an 

orang-utan.  He could be changed back, but the magical books he looks after are so dangerous that he chooses 

to remain as an orang-utan.  It may be hard to communicate when you entire vocabulary is <I>Ook</I>, but I have 

heard of librarians in our universities who feel that very long arms and orange fur would help in dealing 

with their clients!</P> 



<P>In one story (<CITE>Guards! Guards!</CITE>) the Librarian uses a thread, like Theseus, to find his way back from an 

expedition deep into his library.  The density of knowledge is so great that it distorts space-time.  He 

manages to find his way to a point a week ago, before a critical book had been stolen.  After reading it he 

carefully replaces it and retraces his step to the present, following the thread.  Presumably some of our 

librarians wish they could do that, too!</P> 



<P>In another book (Small Gods), he makes the suggestion that this distortion of space-time is so great that 

all Libraries everywhere are connected, in "L-space".  The Librarian is thus able to rescue some books from 

the centre of a burning library in another city.</P> 



<H2>ANDERSON REPORT</H2> 



<P>This idea that all Libraries are - or should be - connected, is one of the central ideas of the 

Anderson Report.  Michael Anderson looked at the problem of support for research, and essentially decided 

that we absolutely have to co-operate and collaborate.  We have highly competitive institutions, but we must 

find ways to develop some sort of national strategy for co-ordinated support for research - a strategy that 

includes the national libraries.  This is especially important in the UK with our numerous smallish universities 

and libraries.  This idea underpins out thinking on the national distributed collection (print and electronic).  

We know also that we must go far beyond connecting OPACs in providing simple means to find our information resources.</P> 



<P>The Anderson Report also raised the issue of preservation of digital information.  We are all familiar with the 

fate of the fabled Alexandria Library, and probably also the medieval monastic library in Umberto Eco's book 

<CITE>The Name of the Rose</CITE> (this library was also a labyrinth, this time to protect the monks from the 

knowledge in some books).  It was not clear until a few years ago that digital information might be similarly 

vulnerable.  Now we realise that the move to digital information - an inexorable move, it seems - brings new and 

unique problems in preservation. In the US, the Commission for Preservation and Access has been considering this 

for some time. They wrote an excellent draft report with the RLG <A HREF="uk-9602-report.html#1"> [1]</A>.  We have now taken our first 

steps to play our part in resolving these difficulties, with a workshop at Warwick last year <A HREF="uk-9602-report.html#2"> [2]</A>.  

Unless we continue to support this work vigorously, it will inhibit taking advantage of the new methods of 

scholarly communication.</P> 



<H2>THE FUTURE</H2> 



<P>So where do we go from here?  We have a significant programme of projects under way.  The projects are 

sometimes described as a set of experiments.  We now have to start looking for ways to make these experiments 

practical realities in our libraries.  We must look wider than the UK, and try to integrate our work with 

overseas projects - whatever we can find that is useful.</P> 



<P>So the first plank of our future strategy is to select some projects, then to embark on scaling up, 

integration and implementation, with wide dissemination and real efforts at cultural change.  We should aim 

to get the results implemented across many or all libraries.  In order to maintain the flow of funding, 

we shall have to "deliver results".</P> 





<P>The second plank is to build on the ideas from the Anderson report.  We must try to increase library 

collaboration. We want to be able to find documents wherever they are.</P> 



<P>The third and final plank of the strategy is to try to make some real progress - backed by real money -

 in the emerging area of digital preservation.</P> 



<P>We have not got all the funds we need to implement this strategy.</P> 



<H2>SUMMARY</H2> 



<P>As a result of the Libraries Review, we have some very substantial programmes funded.  This may not be 

everything we could wish for, but there is plenty to get on with.  The eLib programme is the key development.  

It will have a major effect on cultural change in universities.  We need to go further with this if we can 

get the funding to do so.



<P>The organisation of HE in the UK means we can have a national strategy.  Electronic library developments 

will only happen in this way.



<P>We want to see eLib and other national programmes such as TLTP, etc. developing an holistic approach to 

teaching and learning.  At the same time, we have to try to collaborate more in support of research.



<P>It is important to keep relationships with the USA strong - particular areas include digital preservation, 

licensing and copyright.



<P>We could view our world as a multi-dimensional labyrinth.  In different ways as funders, Vice-Chancellors, 

Librarians and as users, we are all faced with a different maze of difficult choices.  How do we find our way?  

We need whatever guides we can find. Let us hope we treat our Ariadne better than Theseus did.

<H3>TERRY CANNON, Assistant Director, The British Library Research and Development Department</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is based on notes 

taken during the presentation and notes supplied by the speaker.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>For many years the main support agency for Information Technology applications in library information services, 

The British Library Research and Development Department, has had a long-term interest in networking.  The 

founding of UKOLN, by the addition of networking to the existing bibliographic management research centre at 

Bath, set up a powerful facility for awareness, advice, research and standards.  UKOLN initially concentrated on 

the academic sector, but, with encouragement from The British Library, has since extended its operations to all 

types of library. The Research and Development Department itself has undertaken a number of projects in non-academic 

libraries and its plans for the future give a high priority to this area.





<H2>FUNDING</H2> 



<P>The British Library is the main United Kingdom funding agency for research in the Library and Information field.  

Even so, funds are limited - the 1995/6 budget being only �1.6 million.  They are also spread over a wide range of 

topics, such as information policy, user studies, education, training and awareness, and across all communities, not 

just the academic.  In addition, technology is applicable to information handling in all information services, not 

just libraries.  The British Library has had to live with dwindling resources in real terms (the equivalent to the 

1979 level of funding would be �3.6 million today) and the trend looks set to continue.  Much tighter focusing in 

the future is therefore inevitable.



<P>In view of the funding position, collaborations and partnerships with other funding sources are always very 

welcome.  The Library has also become involved in functions which are tantamount to management of research and 

development funds for other bodies - in particular, various public library development schemes for the Department 

of National Heritage.



<P>The Follett initiative to put resources into university library research and development is very much appreciated, 

especially at a time when the smaller scale projects of the type generally supported by The British Library in this 

area were no longer sufficient to address needs.



<H2>RESEARCH PROJECTS</H2> 



<P>Nevertheless a great deal of library research projects have been supported, which in retrospect can be seen as 

precursors to the present eLib programme.  Some of these are described below.



<H3>The BLEND Project</H3> 



<P>BLEND, the Birmingham and Loughborough Electronic Networking Development, was undertaken in the first half of the 

1980s and constituted a very early attempt to set up an electronic journal.  Although the technology was crude by 

today's standards, many new ideas were tested.  The basis of the project was an electronic conferencing system, 

which set up a community linked together by communications (with all of the attributes of a present-day networked 

community), including e-mail, and the journal arose as a by-product.



<H3>QUARTET</H3> 



<P>University College London and the University of Hertfordshire joined them in a subsequent project, the former 

bringing expertise in integrating text, sound and graphics in electronic documents, the latter bringing extensive 

research on optical media.  The quartet of universities combined to investigate electronic document handling, with 

a view to developing practical applications from the research.  One of these was a researcher's workstation, but 

in the event this was superseded by external developments resulting from the rapid progress of technology, currently 

rendering products obsolescent every two years or so.



<P>More recently the University of Loughborough, with Institute of Physics Publishing,  has delivered an electronic 

physics journal, and University College London has networked the American Chemical Society Journals.



<H3>Electronic Library</H3> 



<P>The De Montfort University set up an electronic library on the Milton Keynes campus, with support from The 

British Library, eLib and the European Commission. They also collaborated with the Nara Institute in Japan and with 

NACSIS, which provides an academic network similar to JANET.



<H3>Multi Media</H3> 



<P>A call for proposals in 1987 led to a range of research projects investigating retrieval from image databases.



<H3>Networking</H3> 



<P>Many information technology projects have a networking aspect, and by 1989 its importance had been recognised 

by university libraries and by The British Library. At that time a considerable amount of early work concerned 

with applications, surveys, awareness and publicity was undertaken.



<H2>UKOLN</H2> 



<P>In 1992, UKOLN, the United Kingdom Office for Library and Information Networking, was fully established at 

the University of Bath, with half of its funding from The British Library Research and Development Department 

and half from JISC, the Joint Information Systems Committee.  It is now a major vehicle for dissemination of 

information on electronic libraries, supporting events such as the Follett Lectures, seminars conferences and 

publishing. In particular, UKOLN has demonstrated networking power by implementing and offering a wide range of 

Web services.



<P>ARIADNE, the Internet magazine for librarians and information specialists, is the latest outcome of 

collaboration with eLib and in January of this year it attracted over one hundred thousand accesses.



<P>The Conference on Long Term Preservation of Electronic Materials, held at Warwick University in November 1995, 

engendered various possible study areas, including:

<UL>

<LI>preservation of technology vs emulation of "old" software vs migration;

<LI>"post hoc" rescue of high value material;

<LI>integrity of media/error detection (earlier R&D on this topic was supported by a grant from the Mellon Foundation);

<LI>skills with, and awareness of the needs for, digital archiving.

</UL>



<P>Sectors outside the university environment - where research is a main raison d'�tre - have been less fortunate, 

with no Follett grants and consequently less awareness of information technology or networking matters, and on the 

level of research in general.  The British Library Research and Development Department is therefore concentrating 

efforts on the Public Library and other relevant non-academic sectors.



<H2>PUBLIC LIBRARY SECTOR</H2> 



<P>After long neglect, Public Libraries have a window of opportunity which must not be missed.  Initiatives such 

as EARL, Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries, and Millennium funding must be promoted.  A strong movement 

is developing to "empower the people" through public access to information superhighways.  Political statements, 

such as the following issued recently by the Labour Party are very encouraging:



<BLOCKQUOTE>"Access: We wish to ensure that participation in the information revolution is available to all and not 

just to the privileged few.  There must be equality of access through an integrated national network which covers 

all parts of the country, reaching as extensively and as affordably as possible, in which each network system links 

with others.  We seek to empower individual citizens as participants and consumers and also to ensure equal access 

to the providers of services."</BLOCKQUOTE> 



<P>Currently, rather than Public Libraries being the focus of Governmental networking efforts, priority is being 

given to wiring up schools and hospitals.  Thus, to support the Secretary of State for National Heritage's statement 

concerning uptake of the Internet in Public Libraries, UKOLN commissioned a rapid review of this subject, using 

telephone survey techniques to contact all Public Libraries.  The results, with a 100% response, revealed that:



<UL>

<LI>53% of Public Library authorities have some form of Internet connection;

<LI>only 17% have public access;

<LI>only 3% of service points have Internet connection;

<LI>only 0.7% of service points have public access;

<LI>only 282 workstations are dedicated to this end in the entire country.

</UL>



<P>The survey shows a low take-up and a need for investment; though leading-edge research (for example, CLIP, 

the Croydon Library Internet Project, IT-Point, the Solihull Library Access Project) and consortia such as 

EARL cannot transform Public Libraries.  They can, however, point the way to larger scale endeavours, such 

as the Library Association's Millennium bid, and influence political strategies backed by hard cash - be it 

Government financing, Local Authority sources or public/private sector partnerships.



<H2>THE FUTURE</H2> 



<P>The British Library Research and Development has a new Director, taking his appointment at a time of immense 

change.



<P>The Secretary of State has appointed a new Libraries and Information Commission to co-ordinate information 

issues between sectors, to review the United Kingdom's international role, especially in regard to the European 

Union, and, in particular, to develop research policy in Library Information Systems.  The new Director will be 

involved with the Research Sub-Committee of that Commission.



<P>Meanwhile, the cuts in funding are expected to continue and both The British Library and its Research and 

Development Department will not be exempt.  Accordingly, The British Library is re-structuring and the Research 

arm will follow suit.  There will inevitably be a re-focus of effort, with perhaps less directed at higher 

education, though liaison with that area will remain of paramount importance (universities are still the logical 

contacts for high technology).  Interest will grow in private sector input into research, probably via partnerships 

and joint funding.



<P>It should be emphasised in this context that it will be the hand of friendship that The British Library Research 

and Development Department will be extending and not the begging bowl.  Research will continue at The British Library.

<H1><A NAME="mahoney">BUILDING THE DIGITAL LIBRARY</A></H1> 



<H3>JOHN MAHONEY, Director of Computing and Telecommunications, the British Library</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on notes taken during the presentation and slides used.</EM> 





<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>As one of the world's great research libraries, the British Library has served scholarship, research and 

innovation for over four hundred and fifty years.  Now, tremendous changes are taking place at a rapid, and 

increasing, rate.  Some of these transformations arise from the demands of users who are themselves influenced 

by new phenomena, such as the Internet; some are due to the sweeping changes affecting equipment, particularly 

computers and communications.  The British Library is preparing for this new environment, not only by initiating 

programmes to exploit information technology, but by forging new partnerships to meet the challenges ahead.



<H2>THE BRITISH LIBRARY</H2> 



<P>As well as being the national library of the United Kingdom, the British Library is one of the world's great 

research libraries. With an annual budget of �110 million, it employs a staff of 2,300 people and houses over 

one hundred and fifty million items.



<P>Its main purpose is to serve scholarship, research and innovation.  In this respect the Library is not primarily 

providing resources for undergraduate teaching, but acts rather as a research material provider.  Its strategic 

objectives are exemplified in the following quotations from the Library's Strategic Objectives for the Year 2000 

report:

<UL>

<LI>"By the year 2000, the British Library will be a major centre for the storage of and access to digital texts required for research.";

<LI>"By the year 2005, our digital collection will be enormous and growing at a huge rate.";

<LI>"...becoming a major centre for the capture, storage and transmission of electronic documents...";

<LI>"   we are seeking to make our collection better known and more widely available by exploiting the increasing use of computer networks   ".

</UL>



<H2>USER-DRIVEN CHANGES</H2> 



<P>Computer literacy is becoming more and more commonplace, from the schoolroom to the workplace (a library 

example of how much this aspect has changed is in the OPAC, the On-line Public Access Catalogue, which was 

originally feared to be too complex for the public user and is now considered to be too simple).  This process 

has been encouraged by the exponentially increasing use of the Internet.



<P>In its own services and collections, The British Library is sure that digital materials will not replace all 

traditional library materials and that people will continue to want to use them traditional materials.  In parallel, 

there is an inexorable rise in the demand for digital materials.



<P>There is also a definite trend for users to want desktop type of access, whenever they want and wherever they are.



<H2>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN CHANGES</H2> 



<P>Information Technology (IT) is polarising in respect to its equipment and activities.  Convergence on a global 

scale is manifest in computers and communications, media and publishing (where many organisations are merging) and 

education and entertainment.  The same technology trends are catalysing great individuality, creativity and variety.



<P>Access to electronically held information is distance-independent and in the near future the cost of using 

powerful communications over long distances will be negligible.  At present, one hour of such use would cost about 

five cents.  Although this might be perceived as relatively low and although it will undoubtedly fall, the level 

of charge is currently two orders of magnitude above costs and significant changes are perhaps unlikely over the 

next five years.  Nevertheless communications is now viewed as a global commodity, though the infrastructure is 

not in place as yet in many parts of the world.



<P>Software tools are becoming increasingly inexpensive, easy-to-use, powerful and sophisticated.  This, combined 

with the development, price reductions and availability of hardware advances, such as massively parallel processing, 

will allow desktop computers to interact very quickly and a great deal more naturalistically.



<P>The British Library is preparing for the new environment, where access will be a primary factor.  It has initiated 

the Initiatives for Access programme of pilots and demonstrators to exploit IT, test new services, examine 

organisational implications and provide a vehicle for collaboration and Public Relations - including PR on exactly 

what a great Research and Development library is capable of.



<P>The change of technology has been viewed by some as a change of purpose, but this is not so. That remains the 

same as it has been for the last four hundred and fifty years.



<H2>THE DIGITAL LIBRARY</H2> 



<P>The vision of the British Library is of integrated access to its digital collections and those of other 

organisations. It will, therefore, be organised, and indexed, for such access and will work towards increasing the 

access, both in terms of people and materials, while maintaining availability of digital archives.



<P>Other aspects of that vision will include staff having "digital competencies" (all staff will have need of these, 

not just a few "digital librarians"), establishing a balance between the requirements of Intellectual Property Rights 

and fair dealing with information and the commitment of substantial investment, from both the Library and its partners, 

be they government or private sector.



<P>The priorities will be:

<UL>

<LI>the extension of United Kingdom legal deposit legislation to electronic materials (microform and digital);

<LI>the expansion of British Library document supply services, built on article alerting and improved delivery;

<LI>the expansion of patent services, based on Patent Express (all patent offices issue patents on CD-ROM and it 

is unlikely that any patents will be on paper beyond the next five years);

<LI>improved access to the British Library's historical collections via services to researchers, schools and the 

general public (the Library's issue of such documents on CD-ROM exceeded sales forecasts and won major awards; more importantly, it gave students direct access to manuscripts in full colour to the extent that copies could be printed, relevant details cut 





out and inserted directly into project portfolios - a process which is impossible with original documents)

</UL>



<H2>PARTNERSHIPS</H2> 



<P>Collaboration has always been part of library provision and this has been encouraged by lack of resources, 

especially on a national level.  The global digital library clearly requires co-operation, not least on standards, 

protocols and on services based on access to digital collections.  Different kinds of partnerships will encompass 

agreements on standards, collaboration with other digital collection owners and joint ventures with the private sector.  

Different partners could be derived from the academic community, from industry and commerce and from public libraries.

Partnership will provide opportunities for developing improved, more comprehensive services and a means of sharing 

development costs.  In addition to nationally-based partnerships, the British Library will be seeking to extend 

collaboration with relevant organisations in both the European Union and the United States



<P>It will also seek to utilise the United Kingdom government's Private Finance Initiative, acknowledging its key 

points (transfer of risk to the private sector, value for money for the taxpayer and open competition in the 

selection of partners) in respect to its three main models (financing public investment, private initiative and 

joint venture).



<P>Overall, the great changes now taking place world-wide and at an accelerating rate will transform the nature of 

all libraries and the British Library will not be exempt from that process - far from it.  That is the challenge 

over the next few years, a challenge for which the British Library is preparing and which it is looking forward 

to meeting.

<H1><A NAME="west">CHANGING COSTS OF INFORMATION IN THE NETWORKED WORLD</A></H1> 



<H3>RICHARD WEST, Vice-Chancellor, California State University</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on notes taken during the presentation and slides used.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>The costs of scholarly information are based on long experience with a print-based creation and distribution system.  

The global Internet, however, is already changing the economics of the information distribution system.  Understanding 

networked information and its potential effect on universities' costs for acquiring, storing and delivering information 

is essential in today's information and technology-oriented world.  New approaches to allocating institutional funds to 

recognise networked information are required if scholars and students are to benefit from new information technologies.  

Examining the functions of the scholarly information distribution process will indicate where changes in role and 

investment are required by universities if networked information is to be used successfully.



<H2>THE KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE</H2> 



<P>We can describe the knowledge infrastructure in terms of collection(s) of materials, methods of access, means of 

storage, channels of distribution and technologies for printing and display.  In functional terms, it can be considered 

as equivalent to a traditional library.  By contrast however, the Knowledge Infrastructure is radically different from 

conventional libraries in procedural and conceptual terms.  In effect, we have the two completely different models of 

information management co-existing in parallel.



<P>For any meaningful analysis on the Knowledge Infrastructure, we shall have to assume the existence of the Internet 

(or something like it).  We will also find that the Knowledge Infrastructure demands close collaboration between 

traditionally separate constituencies such as campus organisations, technology groups and librarians.



<H2>CHANGES IN THE INTERNET IN THE US</H2> 



<P>The US has seen a major transition in management of the network over the last 18 months or so.  The change has 

involved the emergence of the Internet as an entity in its own right.  The models for its overall management and 

technical approach are being changed as it moves away from Federal Government control (under the NSF) towards a 

private market approach.  Some academics feel some sense of loss as this privatisation proceeds; but the full 

financial and technological impacts of this evolutionary change - and of the rapid growth which triggered it - are 

still far from complete.



<P>Today, the Knowledge Infrastructure is a priority for the current administration and Congress.  The national 

technological infrastructure effectively extends down to the workstation level, but policy fails to recognise 

the demands of integrated functionality.  The level of regulation is being debated; some want a competitive 

environment, though a regulated environment has real advantages.  The Telecommunications Reform Act - a major 

piece of legislation - is an attempt to reconcile some of these conflicting demands; but competition will be 

central to the policy.



<P>The current network operates on data packets, and is moving towards a market-managed technological environment.  

There are regulated local voice network services and also regulated local video distribution services.  The trend 

is towards integration of these in the near future.



<P>This change and debate inescapably raises the question of what the higher education community's interest should 

be in the evolving national networking infrastructure.



<H2>AN ANALYTICAL MODEL FOR SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATIONS</H2> 



<P>Any model of scholarly communications must extend from the creation of information to its use, and must take in 

all steps in between.  This can be done by expressing a model in terms of functions and performance attributes.



<P>The functions can be summarised in the following list:

<UL>

<LI>Information Generation	

<LI>Preservation and Archiving	

<LI>Acquisition and Access

<LI>Authoring	

<LI>Information Management	

<LI>Storage

<LI>Informal Peer Communication	

<LI>Location and Delivery	

<LI>Distribution

<LI>Editorial and Validation	

<LI>Recognition	

<LI>Utilisation of Information

<LI>Ownership, Privacy, Security	

<LI>Diffusion	

</UL>



<P>Note that a digital Knowledge Infrastructure has to provide equivalents to all of these functions if it is to be 

successful.  Along with these key functions, we have to consider the following performance attributes:

<UL>

<LI>Ease of Use	

<LI>Timeliness	

<LI>Responsiveness

<LI>Accuracy	

<LI>Authenticity	

<LI>Predictability

<LI>Adaptability	

<LI>Relevance	

<LI>Eligibility

<LI>Cost	

<LI>Recovery	

<LI>Innovation

<LI>Extensibility		

</UL>



<P>Analysis with this model suggests that new roles and changed institutional behaviour will be required.  It is also 

clear that there is a desperate need for investment in the technological infrastructure.



<P>The success and survival of the Knowledge Infrastructure must be examined in the light of this model.  We can, 

for example, analyse electronic journals, comparing haw they perform along the entire chain from creator to user, 

compared to the conventional paper scheme.  One of our challenges is to make sure that all functions are performed well.



<H2>THE MARKETPLACE FOR SCHOLARLY INFORMATION</H2> 



<P>The marketplace for scholarly information is evolving rapidly.



<P>The concept of intellectual property rights (IPR) is central; and the issues it raises are controversial.  

Fundamentally, we can identify three kinds of information:



<UL>

<LI>"free" information;

<LI>public information;

<LI>private information;

</UL>

<P>Note that the paper model combines these three kinds of information successfully.  There are two ways in which 

information is used, namely:

<UL>

<LI>compensated use;

<LI>uncompensated use.  

</UL>



<P>Fierce debate rages around what usage should be compensated and what should be uncompensated.  The mechanisms 

for dealing with IPR for electronic materials are not yet fully developed, and where international transactions 

are concerned the level of development is even lower.  The concept of "fair use" is creating a controversial dynamic; 

if anything, there is a trend towards a more conservative, more restrictive interpretation of fair use.



<P>While issues and mechanisms are immature, we can be confident of one thing: there is no free ride in this electronic 

environment; we will get what we pay for!



<H3>Resource Sharing</H3> 



<P>Librarians have long been great sharers of information.  Possibly because of this, perceptions about resource 

sharing are based on concepts allied to the paper model, and these perceptions are changing but slowly.  Accordingly 

there is a tendency towards the premise that any savings will result from an extension of the inter-library loan model; 

and equally a tendency to view the acquisitions budget as likely to show savings.  In fact however, due to the 

continued strength of private property rights in scholarly literature, libraries acquisitions budgets are likely to 

increase rather decrease.  



<H3>Substitution</H3> 



<P>To use the language of classical economics, the marketplace for journals is imperfect.  The imperfection is due to 

the fact that there are no substitutable goods for many journals, as evidenced by the fact that librarians tend to 

reduce the numbers of subscriptions rather than subscribing to alternative titles when faced with price rises which 

exceed budget increases.  The last few years have seen increases of !0% - 15% every year in the cost of journals.  

We can guess that increases cannot continue indefinitely; something is bound to change.



<H3>Information Pricing</H3> 



<P>Electronic media allow for a diverse range of pricing methods and policies.  The question of how we will pay for 

information is now considerably more significant than it was with paper publications.  The pricing schemes include:

<UL>

<LI>per copy acquired (ie traditional pricing);

<LI>per use;

<LI>site licence;

<LI>licence based on specified number of simultaneous users.

</UL>



<P>There may be other variables too; for instance, costs for the same information may vary according to how new or 

old the information is when it is used.



<P>It is important for us to recognise that the different approaches can lead to considerably different total costs.  

We can have some influence on costs, at least in some cases, by co-operating with other users to reap economies of 

scale.  And it is clear that the general trend is towards licensing rather than acquisition.  However, other issues 

are less clear cut: for example, if a licence payment is arranged, what happens when the licence expires?  What 

happens if users are by that time "hooked" on using the information?  Libraries should beware of low initial costs 

for licences.



<H3>COST CENTRES AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL</H3> 



<P>Electronic information requires less storage space than information on paper (though realistically, at best we 

can only hope that it will reduce the rate of growth of library storage space).  Furthermore, the cost of storing 

information electronically is less than the cost of storing the equivalent on paper (at least in the short term).  

So electronic materials can lead to savings in costs for storage, access and circulation of scientific and technical 

materials.  We should look to these cost centres to provide additional funds for content acquisition.



<P>In the US, the concept of needing to pay for archiving and preservation is still relatively young (because the 

history of the US is relatively so short).  But archiving and preservation must be recognised as being of paramount 

importance, and funded accordingly.



<P>Two conceptual changes will be enabled by emerging electronic technologies:

<UL>

<LI>a reconceptualisation of how scholarly research is carried out, without any paper;

<LI>a removal of the assumption that scholarly communications require paper at some point.

</UL>



<P>Most so-called "electronic" strategies today rely on the use of paper at some level.  A good example is the 

SPIRES High Energy Physics pre-prints initiative, which is operating successfully on a large scale.  Although it 

allows the production, circulation and storage of papers in electronic form, the authors still demand that the 

papers be published in paper form.  The real savings of these technologies will only start to be realised when 

there is no paper stage.



<H3>Implications</H3> 



<P>All of these factors will lead us to revise our thinking about the relative importance and sizes of traditional 

library cost centres.  Making investment decisions for electronic information rights in a networked world are complex.  



<P>Content costs will almost inevitably increase, and there is little that librarians alone can do about it.  

We therefore will need to find ways to accommodate the increased costs of information content.  Possibilities may 

include:

<UL>

<LI>seeking increases to the materials/collections budgets;

<LI>charging services fees;

<LI>time value pricing;

<LI>rationing;

<LI>benefiting from productivity savings in other cost centres.

</UL>



<P>Finally, the cost structures may affect collection policies, as there will be pressures to let these policies be 

dictated by usage more than before.





<H2>NEXT STEPS</H2> 



<P>The above has outlined several of the issues and scenarios which will shape the future.  Just when a new 

electronic models will rule is not known; certainly we do not expect any single model to dominate the scene for 

the next twenty years.  Over that period the differing models will exist in parallel.  This will lead to 

"unnecessary:" duplication of some activities - and hence higher costs.  Consequently we will need funds processes 

to support all the models at once, and recognition of this increasingly expensive and complex environment is an 

essential element of any new strategy.



<P>To close, there are some actions we can take to advance the situation positively.  The actions are:



<UL>

<LI>support the creation of competitive marketplaces for all components of data networking and scholarly 

information content, in order to take advantage of the market pressures to drive costs to a minimum;

<LI>support the "fair use" concept for intellectual property in electronic form (but do not expect this to 

reduce costs overall);

<LI>explore co-operative "content" agreements that maximise economies of scale with content providers 

(taking care to minimise long term risks of high expenditure);

<LI>keep public information in the public domain (ie resist efforts to make public information private 

by means of repackaging such as the addition of an attractive interface);

<LI>invest in local campus networking capability (to ensure that the 25% - 30% of faculty who are not 

yet connected to the Internet gain full access);

<LI>promote efforts to maximise public and private periodical information in electronic form

<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>Molecular science is both a very visual and "three dimensional" subject, and one that is very rich in precise 

semantic content and standard definitions.  The CLIC electronic journal project has as its objectives the parallel 

printed and electronic publication of a flagship chemistry journal, that will use some very recent publishing 

technologies to deliver to the reader the three dimensional visual element along with textual information.



<H2>BACKGROUND</H2> 



<P>Chemistry is one of the most visual and "three dimensional" of sciences.  For many generations, communication 

of the subject has been rooted on the printed pages of chemical journals, with even colour a rare event.  

Partially because of such limitations, the subject has evolved a complex and arcane symbolism for its written 

representation.   The complexities of this "chemical  nomenclature" in turn result in substantial risk of the 

propagation of errors and misinterpretation of results.  A refereeing system exists to catch both errors of 

science and transcription errors, but the reality is that referees have few "tools" to assist them to catch 

errors on the printed page other than then own eyes and minds.



<P>For the first time, electronic tools to allow the cost-effective dissemination of three-dimensional information 

are now at hand.  We can envisage distributing electronic documents which represent three-dimensional objects 

(molecules), and which allow readers to "manipulate" them to examine the objects from all angles.  Electronic 

publications also allow other features, such as linking and access statistics.  This combination of features has 

created the opportunity which the CLIC project is exploring.



<H2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</H2> 



<P>The main objective of this eLib project is to develop parallel electronic and printed forms of the established 

journal Chemical Communications.  An electronic version will provide such information to the reader, with what 

might be called "semantic integrity" and accuracy of the information.  We even envisage providing mechanisms for 

readers to comment on the individual articles, and thus to interact with the original authors.  To this extent, 

this aim differs from some other electronic journals, where the paramount objective is to achieve what is called 

"page integrity" with the original printed version.  Whilst semantic and page integrity are not necessarily exclusive, 

to achieve both requires significant extra effort in storing the basic content of the journal, and its presentation to 

the user. Thus the CLIC project will concentrate on developing standards for storing, transmitting, displaying and 

applying molecular information.



<P>This is being achieved in three stages:

<UL>

<LI>by introducing graphically enhanced contents pages.  This was available from August 1995;

<LI>electronic delivery of complete articles, using SGML and HTML, enriched with additional information: expected to be available later in 1996;

<LI>addition of features unique to the electronic edition, being introduced from 1995 to 1997.

</UL>



<P>From March 1997, a number of complete issues of the journal will be available electronically, with some 

enhancement.



<H3>Awareness Raising Objectives</H3> 



<P>Not the least task is educating the audience to actively participate in this method of information retrieval, 

and indeed persuading authors to contribute information in the appropriate form in the first place.  The CLIC 

project thus aims to increase awareness in the chemical community of the possibilities and advantages of electronic 

publications.  This is being achieved by:

<UL>

<LI>training packs;

<LI>conferences (eg ETOC-1, June 1995 and ECHET96, June 1996);

<LI>international meetings (Chemistry on the Infobahn, Chicago August 1995);

<LI>a discussion list and Webmasters forum;

<LI>local IT briefings;

<LI>informative articles in relevant publications;

<LI>installation in chemistry and central university libraries, including structured feedback and evaluation 

from students and staff.

</UL>



<P>The project team is particularly pleased to note that a number of chemistry software vendors are now producing 

freely distributable software for use with the CLIC journal.  In general, this is in the form of "cut-down" versions 

of commercial products, made available for network use by the vendors.  One product specifically designed for 

such an e-journal has recently been announced (Chemscape Chime from MDLI).  Another notable success is the 

popularity of the e-conference: over 15,000 different people have connected to the conference in the last 

ten months (note that this is comparable to the number of attendees at a major ACS conference, but at a fraction 

of the cost!)



<P>For more information on these activities, refer to the URL at the end of this account.





<H3>Chemical Objectives</H3> 



<P>The project also has objectives which are specific to the nature of the discipline of chemistry.  



<P>Primarily, it seeks to achieve "future-proof" electronic delivery mechanisms.  This is problematic, as many 

necessary standards simply do not exist yet.  One approach being investigated is the use of SGML to HTML conversion 

with chemical DTDs.  Another hopeful prospect is the results of the Hyper-G project, namely its distributed servers 

and index engines.  We are also monitoring the progress of the PURL (Persistent URL) initiative.



<P>Another domain-specific requirement is the preservation of chemical semantics.  The team is pursuing a number of 

alternatives including chemical MIME (for the multimedia delivery of molecular content), virtual reality techniques 

(using VRML), Java and CML (Chemical Markup Language).



<H2>THE CLIC CONSORTIUM</H2> 



<P>The CLIC consortium comprises groups in three university chemistry departments (Imperial College, Leeds and 

Cambridge Universities) and a learned society (The Royal Society of Chemistry).



<H2>PRACTICAL POINTS</H2> 



<P>At present, the team approaches authors to request electronic copies of their papers; they then convert them 

and apply the electronic enhancements.  The process of preparing and publishing electronic papers is faster than 

paper publishing, but at the moment both electronic and paper issues are published at about the same time.



<P>One part of the publication process which is easier and faster is refereeing.  In one case, a paper was 

submitted and refereed electronically within eight hours!  We are considering "commentable" or "discussable" 

papers too, but this raises questions about the nature of moderation; the best answers are not yet clear.  



<P>The electronic medium is ideally suited to the gathering of access statistics; this can act as a valuable 

form of peer reviewing.

<H1><A NAME="ross">INTERNET ARCHAEOLOGY: OVERCOMING THE OBSTACLES AND USING THE OPPORTUNITIES</A></H1> 



<H3>SEAMUS ROSS, Assistant Secretary (Information Technology), The British Academy</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on notes taken during the presentation and slides used.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>Archaeology is a particularly appropriate subject to promote the use of electronic media.  Much archaeological 

work is by its nature destructive; archaeologists therefore need to preserve access to primary data in order to 

repeat and test conclusions.  Traditional publishing methods have not provided the functionality that archaeologists 

require to manipulate the data types involved.  The Internet Archaeology project aims to establish both a new 

definitive electronic publication and a model for subsequent developments.  Key issues are touched on, with 

proposed approaches.



<H2>THE PROJECT</H2> 



<P>It is clear that electronic publications can be more flexible and more effective than paper publications 

could ever be.  One brief example illustrates this: during the 1920s, an archaeologist painstakingly 

reconstructed the design of a theatre which had been excavated.  His reconstruction was widely accepted 

until it was re-examined during this decade using solid modelling tools.  Because of the facilities offered by 

solid modelling, this re-examination proved that the earlier work was not completely feasible, and ideas about 

the form of the theatre were revised.  This probably would not have happened without the use of powerful 

computer-assisted techniques.



<H3>Objectives</H3> 



<P>Accordingly, the main objective of this project is to develop a fully electronic, regular, online only, 

refereed  journal.  Internet Archaeology aims to become one of the world's archaeological journals of record, 

by publishing refereed papers of high academic standing which also use the potential of electronic publication 

to the full.



<P>Subsidiary objectives are to:

<UL>

<LI>produce a detailed description of the process of establishing and managing an electronic journal;

<LI>define a suite of access and navigation tools which will allow readers to use the journal;

<LI>contribute to cultural change through the increased use of electronic media.

</UL>



<H3>The Consortium</H3> 



<P>The project consortium is led by the University of York.  The other members are:

<UL>

<LI>Council for British Archaeology;

<LI>The British Academy;

<LI>University of Durham;

<LI>University of Glasgow;

<LI>University of Oxford;

<LI>University of Southampton.

</UL>



<P>The project is constituted as a charitable trust, with a formal management structure including a steering committee, 

an editorial board and a technical panel. The chair of the committee and Honorary Editor is Professor Barry Cunliffe, 

from Oxford.



<H2>WHY ARCHAEOLOGY?</H2> 



<P>Archaeology is well suited to the application of advanced electronic techniques.  It is multidisciplinary subject, which makes calls on many different skills and methods of analysis.  One instance of this is its use of many different data types - text,





 images, numerical data, GIS modelling etc.  Practitioners already make use of electronic tools, and a body of experience in multimedia publication is growing.

WHY AN ELECTRONIC JOURNAL?

An electronic journal will be an ideal vehicle to convey archaeological information.  It will provide new tools to 

allow archaeologists to say things about the past in ways which where not previously possible.  It will allow access 

to primary research data, enriching it with additional functionality so that readers can manipulate this data, 

allowing readers to make use of, and do justice to, the rich diversity of information.



<P>Finally, an electronic journal has some special logistical benefits which make it well suited to the dissemination 

of academic works.  Its network orientation makes distribution both easy and inexpensive; and the distribution can 

include unusual or bespoke programs which add value to the data.



<P>Unfortunately, some drawbacks accompany these benefits.  In particular, the costs of preparing papers have been 

higher than anticipated, partly because of the many different data types with which archaeologists  work.  The team 

has also found that the complexities and difficulties of running an electronic journal are greater than expected, 

but remains convinced that it offers a valuable method of publication for archaeological work.



<H2>CONTENTS</H2> 



<P>The journal will feature:

<UL>

<LI>general articles on archaeological issues, including theoretical. methodological and analytical research;

<LI>excavation and fieldwork reports, including finds studies;

<LI>reports on the applications of new technologies such as software tools and visualisation methods;

<LI>reviews of technological applications available over the network.

</UL>



<H2>ISSUES</H2> 



<H3>Revenue Generation</H3> 



<P>The annual running cost of Internet Archaeology is projected to be about �60,000. Clearly, an equivalent 

revenue stream is needed.  This may arise from diverse sources including subscriptions and access charges.



<P>Various models are being considered; they include personal subscriptions, multiple access subscriptions and 

so on.  One option will be to offer personal subscriptions which allow greater functionality than site licences.  

The final model is not certain; but it has been agreed that the first issue will be free for a period of one year.  

We also intend that keyword searching and contents information will remain free of charge.



<H3>Intellectual Property</H3> 



<P>As in any publication, protection of intellectual property is a concern.  In this domain, there is the added 

complication that some of the data is commercially valuable (eg to companies which offer services connected 

with environmental archaeological impact assessments).



<H3>Refereeing</H3> 



<P>Refereeing is essential for quality control and academic credibility.  It has proved difficult because not 

all archaeologists are sufficiently familiar with the relevant multimedia formats.  A two-stage refereeing process 

is being developed.  The stages are:

<UL>

<LI>concept refereeing: carried out by an archaeologist;

<LI>product refereeing: verifying the user interface, software etc.

</UL>



<P>In practice, this turns out to take place over the network as an iterative process.



<H3>Licensing</H3> 



<P>Careful construction of the reader licences is essential so that the right balance is struck between 

usability and fair use on one hand and excessive sharing on the other.  Rules for citations are envisaged.



<H3>Long Term Preservation</H3> 



<P>Somehow, the long term survival of the journal contents must be assured.  How this will happen is as 

yet unclear.  Evidently, standards will have a part to play here; and the Arts and Humanities Data 

Service may also be involved.  This is a complex issue which is not yet resolved.

<H3>BARBARA McFADDEN ALLEN Director, CIC Center for Library Initiatives</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was prepared for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on an edited version of a paper supplied by the speaker. </EM>



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>The members of the CIC (Committee on Institutional Co-operation) are presently engaged  in the collaborative 

development of the largest fully managed collection of electronic journals available on the Internet.  The project 

directly addresses the growing need to develop, test, and implement networked information tools and resources 

which use collaborative, multi-institutional, efforts.  This paper outlines the development of this resource, 

and concludes with a discussion about the future environment which will be necessary if projects such as this 

are to become commonplace throughout the higher education community.  To place the project in context, 

descriptions of the Committee on Institutional Co-operation (CIC), the CIC universities, the CIC Center for 

Library Initiatives, and CICNet, Inc., are given.



<H2>THE CIC UNIVERSITIES</H2> 



<P>As noted above, the "CIC" stands for the Committee on Institutional Co-operation, a 35 year-old collaboration 

among the following universities:

<UL>

<LI>the University of Chicago;

<LI>the University of Illinois;

<LI>Indiana University;

<LI>the University of Iowa;

<LI>the University of Michigan;

<LI>Michigan State University;

<LI>the University of Minnesota;

<LI>the Pennsylvania State University;

<LI>Purdue University;

<LI>the Ohio State University;

<LI>Northwestern University;

<LI>the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

</UL>



<P>Today, there are over 75 separate and unique co-operative activities operating under the aegis of the CIC.



<P>Collectively the CIC universities account for more than 17% of the doctorates awarded annually, more than 

$2.5 billion in externally funded research annually, and over 17% of the holdings of the Association for Research 

Libraries.  They represent an aggregate total of over 500,000 students, 33,000 faculty, and 57 million volumes 

within their libraries.



<P>Like all of the nation's major institutions of higher education, the CIC universities depend on the availability 

of reliable, high quality resources of all kinds, ranging from those available through their libraries and 

faculties to the most advanced technologies in their laboratories, computing environments, and related teaching 

and research facilities.  What is unique about the CIC universities, however, are the many initiatives within 

and among them which depend on a reliable and advanced networked infrastructure and on staff, facility, and 

financial investments focused on true programmatic Co-operation.  Collaborative initiatives have evolved which 

require stable inter-institutional technical standards and support mechanisms and, increasingly, the availability 

of shared, reliable information resources and services.  Indeed, there are now some initiatives which might not be 

possible without such infrastructures.



<H2>THE COMMITTEE ON INSTITUTIONAL COOPERATION</H2> 



<P>The Committee on Institutional Cooperation is made up of the Provosts of the above universities; it meets 

four times annually.  The office of the CIC is located at Champaign/Urbana, Illinois.  It is professionally 

staffed, with a director and nine FTEs.  Its current operating budget is slightly over $4 million.  It is 

important to understand that there is core financial backing to the philosophical concept of the CIC in order 

to understand the context of this paper.  Additional funding, from member dues, research grants, and the usual 

host of other sources exist for most of the initiatives which have evolved under the umbrella of the office 

of the CIC.



<P>The CIC has always been governed by its three founding principles:

<UL>

<LI>that no single institution can or should attempt to be all things to all people;

<LI>that inter-institutional cooperation permits educational experimentation and progress on a 

scale beyond the capability of any single institution acting alone; 

<LI>that voluntary cooperation fosters effective, concerted action while preserving institutional 

autonomy and diversity.

</UL>



<P>These principles are critical to the successes of our programs.  Among academic consortia, the 

nature of the CIC institutions' collaboration is outstanding: individually these are some of the 

greatest institutions of higher learning in this - or any - country.  They are driven by different missions, 

governed by separate boards and obtain their funding from a variety of separate sources.  They are all 

clearly autonomous organisations with no central funding or administrative body.  Further, each of these 

universities has unparalleled academic and research programs in a variety of fields; they sometimes compete 

fiercely for funding, students and stature.  Yet, co-operatively, they have been able to become a formidable 

force in higher education.



<H2>CIC OFFICES: CO-ORDINATION AND LEADERSHIP</H2> 



<P>Two offices which have evolved under the umbrella of the CIC are the CIC Center for Library Initiatives 

and CICNet, Incorporated.



<P>CICNet, the regional TCP/IP network founded by the CIC in 1988, serves the internetworking needs of the 

CIC universities, other academic institutions, not-for-profit organisations, and businesses.  CICNet has had a 

strong interest in the design and deployment of networked information services.  CICNet is currently involved 

in three major National Science Foundation-funded projects to bring Internet access to under-served communities, 

namely:

<UL>

<LI>Rural Datafication, networking rural communities in the MidWest;

<LI>the Great Lakes Regional American Indian Network, bringing the Internet to American Indians in the Great Lakes region;

<LI>West Virginia RuralNet, helping K-12 science teachers and students in West Virginia take advantage of statewide resources.

</UL>



<P>These projects will enable constituencies that can most benefit from Internet access for communication to 

take advantage of it.  Funding for CICNet is primarily from three sources: member dues from the CIC universities,  

specific projects funded by the National Science Foundation, and the sale of Internet connectivity and services to 

for-profit and non-for-profit sectors.



<P>The CIC Center for Library Initiatives (CLI) was established in September 1994, to support collaborative 

efforts specifically among the CIC libraries.  Co-operative resource sharing has long been a practice among 

the CIC libraries, and the CIC has an enviable record of successful, funded R&D projects.  Most notably, the 

CIC libraries are now engaged in a Virtual Electronic Library (VEL) project, funded through a United States 

Department of Education grant.  The VEL project will develop the technical infrastructure required to provide 

seamless interconnections among a range of  OPAC systems within the CIC libraries, and demonstrate its 

applications through user-initiated interlibrary loans and document delivery throughout the CIC.  The VEL 

will enable more than half a  million faculty, staff, and students to explore and take advantage of vast 

resources within the CIC.  Inherent to the VEL project is the addition of an expanded set of electronic 

sources to the VEL pool of information resources.  The Center for Library Initiatives is funded by dues 

paid by members of the CIC.



<P>Thus the general framework for collaboration lies in the strong support at the highest levels of member 

university administration as evidenced by the existence of the funded office of the Committee on Institutional 

Cooperation and its subsidiaries.  Relevant initiatives in support of the missions of the member universities 

flow from within this framework.  One such initiative, in this case involving the Center for Library Initiatives 

and CICNet, Inc., is the Wide Area Information Resources Management (SEIRM) project, informally referred to as 

the CIC Electronic Journals Collection or CIC EJC.



<H2>THE PROBLEM: UNMANAGED SCHOLARLY MATERIALS</H2> 



<P>Increasingly ubiquitous Internet access within the research university, combined with the popularisation of the 

World Wide Web, has made on-line academic publication and research more desirable.  The expansion of Internet-based 

publishing provides opportunities and challenges for libraries interested in the shared development and management 

of electronic collections.  The low cost per increment of user access compared with print journals, regardless 

of user location, argues strongly for building multi-institutional electronic collections.  Internet tools and 

communications methods also make it possible to distribute the collection development and management tasks across 

multiple institutions.  We are faced with two challenges:



<UL>

<LI>the growing number of scholarly journals, monographs, and pre-prints that are being published by the academic 

community independent of (or in spite of) any commercial publishing organisation;

<LI>the inherent lack of  central co-ordination or management of such resources.

</UL>



<H2>PREDECESSOR TO THE PROTOTYPE: THE CICNET E-SERIALS ARCHIVE</H2> 



<P>The development of the CIC Electronic Journals Collection (CIC EJC) grows out of collaborative efforts between 

CICNet and the CIC library community, combined with CICNet's early work with WAIS and Gopher.  In 1991, the CIC 

library collection development officers asked CICNet to create an archive of the public domain electronic 

journals which many of them had begun to collect locally but had no long-term means of archiving.  CICNet went 

beyond this original charge: archiving e-journals available at CIC member institutions, and sweeping the Internet 

to collect all e-journals that could be obtained through an automated FTP process.  The result, an undifferentiated 

collection of some 700 titles in varying depths of retrospective coverage and completeness, was made accessible on a 

CICNet server, and is now accessed approximately 35,000 times a day by users of the Internet.



<P>The collection process was valuable in illustrating the range of materials available, but it became clear that 

no entirely automated process could produce a collection that would satisfy the needs of most scholars.  The 

process of automatically sweeping the net could be used only to gather those items available through FTP.  Many 

new electronic journals are made available via Gopher or the Web.  The current collection is best thought of as 

a snapshot of materials available at a particular time in the history of the Internet rather than a comprehensive 

resource, but the frequency of its use clearly indicates the need for a reliable managed collection of e-journals.  

This collection is available at URL <A HREF+2gopher://gopher.cic.net:2000/11/e-serials/managed"> 

gopher://gopher.cic.net:2000/11/e-serials/managed</A> 



<H2>A PROTOTYPE COLLECTION: THE CIC-EJC</H2> 



<P>In response to the need for a comprehensive collection of scholarly and research electronic journals, 

the CIC Task Force on the Electronic Collection developed a complete plan for building a managed electronic 

journal collection (CIC-EJC) based on the CICNet gopher server.  The Task Force, which includes representation 

both from CICNet and the CIC libraries, planned the collection from selection to maintenance.  CICNet staff 

then developed a prototype system based on the recommendations and input of the Task Force.  The prototype 

system is available on the World Wide Web at URL http://ejournals.cic.net and is intended to serve as an 

illustration of the work which can be achieved by the librarians of the CIC universities and the staff of 

CICNet.  It includes some 50 electronic journals, with current bibliographic records, complete and current 

holdings of all titles in the collection, a helpful World Wide Web interface which links the bibliographic 

records to the e-journals (the journals remain on publishers' sites; the text is archived by CIC-EJC), and 

consistent archiving of the materials in the collection.  The prototype supports browsing by title and by 

subject, and searching the bibliographic records.  The titles are mainly in the areas of IT and science 

subjects, but we hope to increase the Arts and Humanities coverage.



<P>We have  five broad objectives for this project:

<UL>

<LI>Create the largest professionally managed collection of public domain electronic journals on the Internet 

today, providing access via the World Wide Web and Gopher to scholars, libraries, and individuals around the world.

<LI>Engage both technologists and librarians in the development of this system, identifying and documenting 

those areas where librarians can contribute to the increasingly difficult task of managing Internet resources, 

while technologists design sophisticated access, retrieval, and archiving tools and processes.

<LI>Identify optimum procedures for permanently archiving materials found in the collection thereby serving as 

a testbed for the national electronic information preservation community.

<LI>Serve as a model for any individual or organisation wanting to create a similar repository of electronic 

information on the Internet.  The development process will be fully documented and made available via the 

World Wide Web and Gopher.

<LI>Provide information to electronic publishers and authors in the important areas of distribution, use, 

and security.  Research and reports on the use of the system will be distributed throughout the project 

via the World Wide Web and Gopher.

</UL>



<P>The work of the project has been divided and organised as follows:



<H3>Center for Library Initiatives:</H3> 

<UL>

<LI>Co-ordination and leadership.

</UL>



<H3>CICNet, Incorporated:</H3> 

<UL>

<LI>Technical support, guidance, and implementation;

<LI>Development and maintenance of all technical aspects of the system (hardware and software);

<LI>Acquisition and archiving;

<LI>Publisher relationships and permissions;

<LI>Organise and display bibliographic data;

<LI>Develop indexing and search utilities.

</UL>



<H3>CIC Member Librarians:</H3> 

<UL>

<LI>Evaluation of available information resources;

<LI>Selection;

<LI>Cataloguing;

<LI>Monitoring (quality control).

</UL>



<H3>DEVELOPMENT PLANS</H3> 



<P>We hope to begin aggressive development of this resource within the next six months including:

<UL>

<LI>Aggressive growth (adding hundreds of e-journals)

<LI>Addition of commercially licensed e-journals, with concomitant security and authorisation systems

<LI>Exploring the addition of multimedia publications

<LI>Researching publisher and user behaviour in this new environment

<LI>More sophisticated refreshing, archiving, and preservation processes and procedures

<LI>Providing direct links between the OPAC records for these e-journals and the collection

</UL>



<P>Along the way, we hope to obtain insights into the answers for relatively fundamental questions, such as:

<UL>

<LI>is this approach a long term answer?

<LI>should an initiative of this nature be national or international?

<LI>how should multimedia objects be handled?

</UL>



<P>We will also consider natural functional enhancements, such as full text searching.

<P>As we move forward with development of a viable virtual electronic library, the CIC EJC will serve both as 

a testbed of inter-university collaboration and as an integral information resource for our users.  The CIC 

Center for Library Initiatives,  in concert with CICNet, will continue the work of tying together discrete 

projects and developments with an aim of providing flexible, desktop access and delivery of information 

resources for the 500,000 students and 35,000 faculty and researchers of the CIC universities.



<P>In the short term, we have submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation for support of the 

CIC EJC.   We will continue to refine specifications for interlibrary lending systems and concomitant 

delivery mechanisms, and we will move aggressively into the production and dissemination of digital 

resources.  Our aim is to deploy a seamless access tool to allow users to navigate the wealth of CIC 

library and information resources.  Through such action, we will continue the tradition of excellence 

in higher education upon which the CIC was founded - providing our students with the finest education 

available, and providing our researchers with unparalleled access to information.  And by providing the 

CIC EJC to the Internet community we continue our great tradition of serving a vital role as contributors 

of research results and products to the broader international education community.

<P><EM>At the request of the speaker, this presentation has not been reported here in full.  

Interested readers are referred to the URLs shown at the end of the paper.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>This presentation described the innovative instructional projects that combine networked information 

technology and resources, interdisciplinary teams for design and delivery of instruction and interests in 

student collaborative learning.  The descriptions were based on data from the ten project teams who 

participated in the Coalition for Networked Information's second invitational Conference on New Learning 

Communities, held at Indianapolis in November 1995.



<H2>NEW LEARNING COMMUNITIES</H2> 



<P>The first New Learning Communities conference was held in July 1994 in Phoenix and was furthered in a 

subsequent conference in November 17-19 1995 at Indianapolis. Both were organised under the auspices of the 

Coalition for Networked Information, CNI.  The programme seeks to promote cross-fertilisation of the different 

types of professionals in higher education who use networks to enrich their curricula and broaden students' 

learning experiences.



<P>To achieve this aim, the programme brings together institutional, or inter-institutional, teams of 

varying compositions and roles, comprising faculty, librarians, information technologists, instructional 

technologists and students. The exchange of ideas and exposure to different viewpoints will lead to a greater 

understanding of the total perspective in terms of campus utilisation of networks and the development of a set 

of "best practices" for the benefit of the wider educational community.



<H2>THE PROJECTS</H2> 



<P>From the propositions put forward in response to a call for projects issued by CNI early in 1995, 

ten teams were selected to participate in the Indianapolis conference.  The projects are:

<UL>

<LI>Collaboratory (University of Hawai'i at Manoa and University of Alberta)

<LI>Collaborative Development of Web Pages for Students in a First Year Colloquy Series (Gettysburg College)

<LI>Distance and Electronic Education Project: A Mini-Grant Program (John Hopkins University)

<LI>LC Online (Louisiana College)

<LI>UWired: Teaching, Learning and Technology (University of Washington)

<LI>The California Young Scholar Program (California State Polytechnic, Pomona)

<LI>Student Directed, Information Rich (SDIR) Learning (North Carolina State University)

<LI>Fine Arts 121: A Model for Developing a Digital Undergraduate Curriculum (University of Southern California)

<LI>Integrating Networked Information into Instruction (Mesa and Estrella Mountain Community Colleges)

<LI>The Delta Project Integrated Database: Biological Sciences and Art (California State University System)

<H1><A NAME="chesters"> LANGUAGE LEARNING:

A CONSORTIUM APPROACH</A></H1>



<H3>GRAHAM  CHESTERS, TELL Consortium, University of Hull</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on notes taken during the presentation and slides used.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>Over 30 UK universities have joined together to produce and evaluate language learning courseware 

in five European languages.  The project is nearing completion, with over 40 packages coming on stream 

in 1996.  Issues such as consortium management, pedagogic design, formative evaluation procedures, 

training and dissemination all suggest lessons to be learned.



<H2>THE TELL PROJECT</H2> 



<P>The focus of the Technology Enhanced Language Learning project (TELL) was the production of 

courseware for language learning.  The project was initiated in 1992, and was funded by the 

Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP).



<P>The objective was to produce courseware for French, German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese.  

All levels of learner were to be catered for, from beginner to final-year expert.  The courseware 

was developed to run on current desktop systems; as the project started in 1993, the basic 

requirement is a PC with a 80386 processor or an equivalent Macintosh.



<P>The project started in January 1993 and was formally completed in December 1995, with a total budget 

of �1.35 million.  Being funded ultimately by top-slicing from the funding councils, it was undertaken 

in order to determine the value of computer-aided learning, and the place it should have, in this field.



<H2>PROJECT DELIVERABLES</H2> 



<P>The products to be delivered by the project were divided into three strands, namely:

<UL>

<LI>courses (ie development of material to complement existing language courses);

<LI>resources (dealing with grammar, vocabulary etc);

<LI>tools (for authoring, translation, etc).

</UL>



<P>For example, there is a translation environment, which provides help and hints etc; and sets of 

grammar exercises to get students to apply their new knowledge.



<P>In the end, the project has produced 43 packages. These include seven CD-ROMs and 36 networkable packages. 

They are at present being commercialised, but are available to higher education institutions at cost.



<H2>PROJECT ORGANISATION</H2> 



<P>TELL was performed by a consortium led from the University of Hull, which is also the location of the 

Computers in Teaching Initiative (CTI) Centre for Modern Languages.  The project has thus benefited from 

CTI expertise in requirements, its knowledge of appropriate developers, and experience in project management.  

There were 15 development sites and 21 affiliate (evaluation) sites.



<P>Project management was performed by the speaker (about 25% of time), a project manager (50%), and one 

other (100%), with secretarial support.  It turned out that project management was difficult and demanding, 

for several reasons.  The obvious reason is that tight production deadlines and academia do not necessarily 

sit well together.  Less obvious perhaps is the complexity of managing and distributing funds to so many other 

institutions through the University of Hull.  Finally, liaison with the funding councils was problematic in the 

early days of the project, specifically in the area of co-ordination between projects (for example over the issue 

of copyright).



<P>Some of the motivators, or "adhesives", which helped the consortium work together effectively included payment 

deadlines, and the requirement to complete tasks in order to get paid; reputation, which impelled contributors to 

produce good quality work; and a degree of camaraderie with co-workers engaged in similar tasks.



<H2>COMMON ACTIVITIES</H2> 



<P>Co-ordination of work and standardisation of approaches was of course important with a consortium as 

large as TELL.  Within about six months of the start of work, we had agreed  common guidelines (down to the 

level of fonts and colours).  As an evaluation of the value of tools of this type is an important part of the 

project, we also agreed  common evaluation procedures, including a particularly extensive exercise to monitor 

students using software packages.



<P>We undertook and planned widespread dissemination activities, using common materials.  This included 

workshops, site visits, and prospective user group meetings.



<H2>SUCCESSES</H2> 



<P>The project materials are now being promoted (copies of promotional literature are available on request), 

and the materials themselves will be available from April 1996 onwards.  Some funding has been obtained for 

ongoing maintenance and development.



<P>We are optimistic of success, but obviously it remains to be proven.  Signs of success will be a sense 

of ownership of the products by the HE community; development of a "materials bank" consisting of additional 

compatible resources, and development of new packages.  The amount of success will become apparent in a 

timescale of some two or three years.



<P>On another level, we already know we can claim some successes.  We successfully steered a consortium of 

over 30 universities to work together and to produce results.  Teams have been formed, some of which are 

continuing to work together.  Many skills have been acquired and enhanced during the course of the project.  

And we have created a seed bed into which the nuclei of new ideas can fruitfully be planted.

<H1><A NAME="kayam"> IT POINT - NETWORKING IN THE COMMUNITY</A> </H1>



<H3>GULSHAN KAYAM, IT POINT Manager &amp; SUE TURNER, Library Manager, Chelmsley Wood Library</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was prepared for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is based on edited and merged versions of papers and slides supplied by the speakers.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 

<P>IT POINT is about bringing the benefits of IT to the community, and to create a vision of the public branch 

library of the 21st century.  The project involved the installation of PCs with a wide range of facilities for 

public use into a branch library.  This paper describes the aims of the project, the implications for the public 

library service, and community involvement and awareness.  Statistical details of usage are provided, and the paper 

concludes with a glimpse into the future for IT POINT and information networking in public libraries.





<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2> 



<P>IT POINT is within Chelmsley Wood Library, a large branch library situated in the North of Solihull, to the 

East of Birmingham.  It is the second largest library in the borough, serving a community of about 24,000 with a 

collection of some 60,000 items.



<H3>IT POINT</H3> 



<P>IT POINT is a part of the public library.  It contains facilities for members of the public to book and pay 

for the use of one of six PCs to access a range of facilities.  The facilities include:



<UL>

<LI>Internet access;

<LI>electronic mail;

<LI>word processing & desktop publishing;

<LI>other software;

<LI>CD-ROMs;

<LI>open learning facilities;

<LI>scanning and colour printing;

<LI>computer magazines and manuals;

<LI>careers and training data;

<LI>teletext services.

</UL>



<P>Customers can use training packages to learn how to use software packages at their own pace.



<P>IT POINT is not only a fully functioning service but also a research project funded by The British Library 

Research and Development Department.  The research nature is illustrated by the fact that the service was originally 

free when opened in August 1994.  Charges were introduced in October 1995, to test ways of sustaining the project, 

and are likely to stay.  The project has been an opportunity to provide public library managers with a well-tested 

model which can be adapted to their own services.  Its present funding from the BL R&DD ends in March 1996; the 

future of the service and how it can be sustained are examined below.



<P>The project has created an opportunity to redress the imbalance of IT development in the library community where 

academic libraries have benefited from the development of JANET and special libraries can often call upon the finances 

of a large parent organisation.



<H3>Aims of the project </H3> 



<P>The aims are to:



<UL>

<LI>bring the benefits of IT to the people in Chelmsley Wood;

<LI>increase awareness of IT;

<LI>remove "technofear", among both staff and public;

<LI>make IT facilities available for local people and businesses;

<LI>discover users' reactions to the facilities and services provided;

<LI>test various IT-based services as prototypes for elsewhere in the UK.

</UL>



<H3>Results</H3> 



<P>Early findings are described below; the final report is planned to be available in May 1996.



<H2>LIBRARY IMPLICATIONS</H2> 



<P>These IT services are managed not by library staff but by an IT expert (Gulshan Kayam).  The library's role has 

been to support the project and ensure it complements the library service offered to the community.  The advantages 

of having such a facility within a branch library have been enormous.  Access to the Internet and CD-ROMs is an 

excellent boost to any library service.



<P>Staff training and awareness have been fundamental to the acceptance and utilisation of these new formats.  But 

there remain a number of challenges to using IT for information provision:



<UL>

<LI>staff perceptions: IT is still seen as a last resort for answering an enquiry.  The culture is still geared to 

print-based media; staff find it easier to use, and are more "comfortable" with paper.  We are hoping to change this 

culture by further training;

<LI>keeping up to date with the latest information and databases available on the Internet and CD-ROM, then 

disseminating the information;

<LI>public perceptions which question the reliability of information which is supplied in a format other than the 

printed word;

<LI>the question of whether or not to charge for the service.  There are fine lines to be drawn and real issues for 

public libraries.  For example, it is possible to charge a member of the public for using the equipment to make an 

enquiry, but it is usual not to charge if the same person asks a member of staff who then uses the same equipment.

</UL>



<P>Statistics for the use of IT POINT by staff for public enquiries have not been collected, but on average there 

are some two or three such per week.  The volume probably would increase if there were greater integration into the 

library service, for example if there were CD-ROM and Internet access at the Information Desk.  This will come with 

a change in culture and with younger, more IT-literate, staff.



<H2>COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND AWARENESS</H2> 



<P>In addition to using IT for public enquiries, we have also used more direct methods to introduce our customers to 

the advantages of IT.



<P>The greatest success has been in schools.  Not all local schools have PCs and CD-ROMs, so IT POINT has provided a 

real advantage.  We have organised an annual contest between primary schools, called the CD-ROM challenge.  In this 

competition, groups of students race against each other to answer questions using CD-ROM encyclopaedias.  We have 

also organised a Print vs IT challenge to encourage recognition between the different formats of information.



<P>We use CD-ROMs with younger customers as well, in story time sessions for under-fives.  This encourages parents 

to recognise that they may have a need to understand IT in order to support their children's education needs.



<P>Using the library's links with the careers service has also ensured the high profile of IT POINT, as it becomes a 

showcase once a year when the library hosts the annual Careers Convention for the locality.  Therefore, young adults 

and their parents have an opportunity to view and use the facilities.



<P>Informal coffee mornings and introductory tours have been an opportunity to encourage our customers to recognise 

the advantages of IT and the role it has to play within the library.



<P>All these activities have been ways of changing people's perceptions of libraries by ensuring the use of IT is 

customary within libraries.



<H2>EARLY FINDINGS</H2> 



<H3>Geographical distribution</H3> 



<P>IT POINT currently has 1,100 members.  50&#37; of members are local, from Chelmsley Wood. A further 24&#37; of members 

come from nearby neighbouring areas in North Solihull, 5&#37; come from South Solihull and the rest come from neighbouring 

cities such as Birmingham  and Coventry.  See chart 1 below.

 

<P><IMG SRC="http://www.cni.org/regconfs/img/uk-9602/chart1.gif" ALT=" Chart 1 showing Chemlmsley Wood 50%, North Solihull 24%, South Solihull 5%, Birmingham 15% and elsewhere 6%"> 





<H3>Age and Sex</H3> 



<P>IT POINT's  membership ranges from 5 years of age to 75.  Chart 2 shows the division of men, women, boys and 

girls using the services.



<P><IMG SRC="http://www.cni.org/regconfs/img/uk-9602/chart2.gif" ALT="Chart 2 showing Men c. 500, Women c. 350, Boys c. 200 and girls c. 75"> 

 

<H3>Usage</H3> 



<P>Usage increases noticeably during the Summer months, when school children are on holiday, and make greater use 

of the service.  For example, in August 1995 Internet usage reached 279 hours.  Chart 3 shows the change in usage 

by month, for selected applications over a four month period in Summer 1995.



<P><IMG SRC="http://www.cni.org/regconfs/img/uk-9602/chart3.gif" ALT="Chart 3 showing, in descending popularity, Internet, Word Proc., CD-ROM, Graphics, Spreedsheet usage"> 

 

<P>Usage of the service dropped in October 1995, which is when usage charging was introduced.  The decrease can be 

seen by comparing chart 3 with chart 4, which shows usage for the following four months. Usage is now steadily 

progressing, and with further marketing  of IT POINT's services we anticipate that usage will increase anew. Internet 

usage here includes Electronic mail, Web browsers, Telnet, Gopher and FTP.

<H2>KIND OF USAGE</H2> 



<P>The usage is shown above in strictly statistical terms.  What impact IT POINT has had on the community, we do not 

know yet.  This is the subject of research work in progress; it is being carried out by researchers from the University 

of Central England.  However, we already see a wide diversity of kinds of usage:



<UL>

<LI>we see school children using the Internet and CD-ROMs to conduct research for their homework, and to use a word 

processor to type essays.  Students also use IT POINT for similar purposes;

<LI>we see the unemployed using IT POINT's services  to create curriculum vitae, and they use the IT Open Learning 

Centre to develop their IT skills  while they are waiting for interviews;

<LI>we  see small businesses using our services as a test centre before purchasing their own system, including 

access to the Internet, software or training packages;

<LI>we see families come together to use the various services with their children or grandchildren, who recognise 

this is the way forward for public libraries.  They are glad to be able come to their local library to find out or 

access information which they otherwise would have difficulty in finding.

</UL>



<P>We also see fascinated individuals who are totally taken by  what the Internet has to offer and over the past 7 

months we have been providing Internet awareness sessions to the community.



<H2>TRAINING</H2> 



<P>People attending training sessions are not necessarily  members of  IT POINT.  Some are from the private sector.  

As well as aiming to raise the awareness within the community , IT POINT has been used to train internal staff to use 

the Internet and CD-ROMs.  And not staff just from Libraries but also from the IT Department, Arts & Tourism, Careers 

and Housing Departments.  We also have  close  relationships with the local Job Centre and the Citizens' Advice Bureau.  

We have provided awareness sessions for their staff, enabling  them to refer clients with confidence having seen what 

we have to offer.



<H2>EVOLUTION OF IT POINT</H2> 



<P>We see three main themes emerging:





<UL>

<LI>general library use: library staff using the systems to answer reference enquiries, and members of the public 

using IT POINT as a library resource;

<LI>education and training - life long learning;

<LI>specific information resource retrieval, where the potential is not in terms of information but also information 

publishing.

</UL>



<H2>FUNDING</H2> 



<P>Chelmsley Wood is eligible for European Objective 2 funding, where the aims are to help alleviate problems arising 

from the decline in traditional industry.  One of the reasons to locate IT POINT in Chelmsley Wood was because of 

funding; a means of  maintaining the service when the British Library Research and Development grant ends.



<P>We have applied for European Funding namely, European Social Fund and European Regional Development Fund.  We have 

worked with the local college, Solihull College, and together we are planning to implement a Telecollege, which has 

resulted as part of a successful Single Regeneration Bid (SRB). It  will run for five years starting this year.  The 

total funding from SRB, European money and Further Education would be �350,000.



<P>All the courses  offered will be accredited courses leading to qualifications.  The Telecollege project will involve 

local firms and will build IT-based courses relevant to their skill needs.  We hope they begin to make a financial 

contribution, in order to ensure maintenance of the service when the SRB funding comes to an end.





<H2>THE FUTURE</H2> 



<P>Taking a look at the future of IT POINT, three main issues emerge:





<UL>

<LI>The Immediate Future;

<LI>The Value of IT POINT to the community and corporate objectives of Solihull Council;

<LI>Networking.

</UL>



<H3>Immediate Future</H3> 



<P>The immediate future will be completing the original project, specifically the research dimension. in terms of 

British Library Funding which comes to an end at the end of March 1996.  We will also continue with the training work 

and the Single Regeneration Bid and Telecollege already mentioned.



<H3>Value of IT POINT to the Community and Corporate Objectives of Solihull Council</H3> 



<P>In terms of  value to the community and corporate objectives to the council,  it is already evident that there is a 

need for:

<UL>

<LI>information dissemination: this will play a part in Solihull's economic development strategy and tourism development; 

<LI>Life Long Learning Resource - SRB and the Telecollege - project LISTED. 

</UL>



<P>The purpose of Project LISTED is to develop a dynamic cataloguing system of distance learning materials accessible 

from libraries.  Solihull is the co-ordinating partner of Project LISTED and the project is due to start mid March.  

Chelmsley Wood has been chosen as one of eight test sites, the testing is due to take place approximately 9 months 

after the start of the project.



<H3>Community Networking</H3> 



<P>A number of important questions arise.  Where does this leave the library service? How do libraries ensure they 

will have a lead role ? How does this fit in with the digital information that is being delivered by cable to the home 

and will there be as many public kiosks as there are telephones?  We look to this sort of research to try to answer 

these questions.



<P>There is now a plethora of networks.  We see community networking, libraries networking, schools and higher 

education networking... but how can this all come together?  How do we bridge the gap?  The answer may be government 

funding through the LA millennium bid, public access kiosks and networking with cable companies and BT which is already 

in progress.  And this is suggested by the document produced by the Local Government Management Board, called 

<CITE>Tomorrow's Town Hall</CITE>.  A key passage of this report states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"...Councils were better placed to deal with "information imbalance" in society than any other institution [...] 

and now an Internet service is at the heart of all its libraries' services, heavily subsidised for all and free to 

those on benefits or low incomes."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>We fervently hope that this will happen before the year 2000.



<P>Higher education depends on the community for its intake and context, and not just on the students currently 

"in the mill".  All public libraries need to benefit from the Electronic Libraries Programme.  They have no benevolent 

central funding.  To conclude, what we need is co-operation and project co-ordination.



<H2>CONCLUSION</H2> 



<P>After 20 months experience with IT POINT, it is obvious that Information Technology has a vital role to play 

within public library provision.  This should be not only for the purpose of accessing greater amounts of information 

with greater ease, but also to support life long learning skills in the community.  However, public libraries are not 

going to achieve this in isolation.

<H1><A NAME="lippincott"> COLLABORATION: PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGISTS</A></H1> 



<H3>JOAN LIPPINCOTT 

Assistant Executive Director, Coalition for Networked Information</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is based on notes 

taken during the presentation, slides used, and a paper supplied by the speaker. </EM>



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>In many institutions, librarians and computer professionals, faculty and researchers are developing 

collaborative relationships.  Many of these relationships have evolved in the context of networked 

information resources and services.  The characteristics of true collaborations or partnerships are 

examined and their elements defined - taking into account the views of expert authors such as Schrage, 

Kantor and Katzenbach and Smith - and using examples of library/computing partnerships in higher education, 

in areas such as development of campus information systems, teaching and learning programmes, facilities and 

services.  Factors that promote collaboration, and those that impede it, are explored in the light of the 

experience of participants in the Coalition for Networked Information's Working Together programme, which 

brings together teams of librarians and information technologists.



<H2>THE NATURE OF COLLABORATION</H2> 



<P>Many of the collaborative relationships which are now developing in many institutions, between librarians, 

computing professionals, teaching faculty and researchers, have evolved in the context of networked information 

resources and services.



<P>This paper describes the characteristics of successful relationships, based on the work of writers in the 

fields of communications and organisational behaviour.  The range of existing collaborations in the networked 

information environment will be categorised and factors which motivate collaboration, and those that hinder it, 

will be examined.  The implications for library administrators, computer controllers and higher education 

institutes, both now and in the future, will be considered.



<P>The roles and job functions of librarians and information professionals have been subject to significant 

change over the last five to ten years - firstly as a result of automation and, latterly, as a consequence of 

the advent of networks.



<P>In some higher educational establishments this has led to the administrative merging of libraries and 

computing centres; in others it has resulted in increased collaboration between two administratively separate 

units and there are yet others where the consequence has been duplication of some functions.



<P>In the development of local library systems, libraries often contracted with computing centres to run library 

applications on mainframe computers (sometimes physically located in the computing centre), update and amend 

software and take responsibility for the reliability and integrity of the system.  The library was responsible 

for the system conceptualisation and content.  Reciprocal arrangements, wherein computing centres contracted 

with libraries for informational needs, have not been much in evidence.



<H2>NEW RELATIONSHIPS</H2> 



<P>As the information environment has become increasingly networked, librarians and information technologists 

have begun to move from contractual arrangements to new patterns of relationships characterised by a move 

towards shared responsibility in:

<UL>

<LI>conceptualisation of projects;

<LI>authority;

<LI>allocation of resources.

</UL>



<P>Some researchers describe these new relationships as collaborations or partnerships. In Shared Minds in 1990,  

Michael Schrage defined collaboration as "the process of shared creation: two or more individuals with complementary 

skills interacting to create a shared understanding that none had previously possessed or could have come to on their 

own.  Collaboration creates a shared meaning about a process, a product, or an event."  Schrage's concept of 

collaboration focuses on the characteristics of the process of interaction among the partners, with emphasis on an 

intangible - shared meaning - and a quality of interaction between the participants that can best be described as 

mutual respect.  His view of collaboration, therefore, encompasses:

<UL>

<LI>shared creation;

<LI>complementary skills of individual participants;

<LI>development of new, enriched, shared understandings;

<LI>realisation that each individual needs the insights and expertise of other partners.

</UL>



<H2>CHARACTERISTICS OF BEST PARTNERSHIPS</H2> 



<P>Rosabeth Moss Kantor in 1990 described productive partnerships as those which evolve and continue nevertheless 

to yield benefits, create new value and work through interpersonal connections and internal infrastructures which 

enhance learning.  She identifies eight characteristics of best partnerships:

<UL>

<LI>each partner contributes something of value;

<LI>the strategic objectives of all partners are addressed;

<LI>partners have complementary skills and assets;

<LI>each partner makes an investment in the other (as distinct from a contractual relationship, in which there is no 

such mutual investment);

<LI>communication is reasonably open;

<LI>mechanisms for smooth working together are in place;

<LI>each partner becomes both teacher and learner;

<LI>there is integrity and mutual trust.

</UL>



<P>Kantor's characteristics are similar to Schrage's in emphasising the mutual reliance of partners, the need for 

each to contribute skills and/or knowledge and the development of trust, but she adds a key element in the 

realisation by participants that they must address a common mission or strategic objective.



<H2>LIBRARY AND COMPUTING COLLABORATION</H2> 



<P>Ten years ago, neither the library nor the computing centre would have nominated a Campus-Wide Information 

System (CWIS) as one of their strategic goals.  Now most campuses expect that a CWIS is either available or is 

being developed by one or more units - and both the library and the computing centre would have a valid claim to 

its being within their strategic province. By combining resources, pooling professional talents and learning from 

each other, the two units can implement a collaborative project which will enhance the information environment of 

the campus and yield shared meaning.



<P>In a true collaboration, each unit considers the endeavour to be mission critical, while in a contractual 

relationship only one party would have that view, the other having provision of support services as the primary 

goal.  Also, in a collaboration, risks and benefits are shared, whereas in a contractual arrangement, the contracting 

party reaps most of the benefit if the project is successful and is the major loser if the project fails.  Success, 

as far as the party providing services is concerned may still provide a limited share of some of the benefits, but 

failure will not prejudice the agreed remuneration.



<H2>THE WISDOM OF TEAMS</H2> 



<P>In their widely read 1993 book, <CITE>Wisdom of Teams</CITE>, Katzenbach and Smith focused on the dynamics 

of team performance - defining a team as "a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed 

to a common purpose, performance goals and approach, for which they hold themselves mutually accountable."  

They also suggest that while teams can and should take direction from upper management levels, they must shape 

their own purpose and they stipulated five factors typical of teams:

<UL>

<LI>meaningful purpose;

<LI>specific performance goals;

<LI>a common approach to the work;

<LI>complementary skills (in three areas: technical or functional expertise, problem-solving and decision-making, interpersonal capabilities);

<LI>mutual accountability.

</UL>



<P>A particularly useful aspect of the work of Katzenbach and Smith was in their delineation of the differences 

between teams and working groups.  In the latter, a common area of work is identified and group members are assigned 

work based on their specific areas of expertise and their performance is judged individually.  There is no attempt to 

develop mutual accountability or shared meaning.  By contrast, the team approach encompasses both individual and 

mutual accountability and shared meaning is fundamental to it.  The different quality of interaction results in 

an end-product for a team-based project which is more than the sum of the individual team member contributions.



<H2>FACTORS WHICH HELP; FACTORS WHICH HINDER</H2> 



<P>CNI sponsored a workshop/retreat to assist new and existing teams in learning better ways of working together.  

One of the techniques to help them develop shared meaning was an exercise in force field analysis, from which the 

teams identified several factors which tended to motivate collaboration between librarians and information 

technologists:

<UL>

<LI>common goals, clients and tools (arguably the most important in setting a firm foundation);

<LI>leveraging resources (the reasons for combining budgets and committing resources helps realise the project's mission; bringing disparate skills together engenders new skills);

<LI>attracting grants;

<LI>management pressures.

</UL>



<P>It is perhaps much harder for people to discuss problems. Nevertheless factors which hinder collaboration 

have been identified as:

<UL>

<LI>different attitudes towards change;

<LI>different levels of technological expertise;

<LI>lack of understanding of the skills of other participants;

<LI>desire to control one's own resources;

<LI>the budget process.

</UL>



<P>Administrative structure and personality differences can exacerbate any one or all of these factors.  

Collaboration initially on a smaller scale may help counter problems, especially in the case of the last two.



<H2>INFORMATION SERVICES</H2> 



<P>Only a few years ago, the provision of information services to the campus community had a very different 

meaning for both libraries and computing centres.  Advances in the networked information environment in, for 

example, library catalogues on the Internet and universal access to information via gopher and the World Wide 

Web, have brought library and computing centre services closer together.  The traditional division of complementary 

skills into "content" for librarians and "conduit" for computing professionals, which has served as a good starting 

point for collaborations, has become increasingly blurred.



<P>Collaborations on service projects with a concrete outcome, such as the provision of reference facilities, or the 

establishment of a help desk, or the development of an Internet training programme, offer opportunities for staff 

from library and the computing centre to begin to discuss common mission, can provide mechanisms for sharing skills 

and will encourage the concept of shared meaning.



<P>The development of a campus information environment, including information policies, creation and distribution 

of electronic journals and the development of Web sites and pages, provides a fertile ground for the exchange of 

ideas on the mission of the library and of the computing centre, promotes convergence of the principles and 

practical experience of professionals in both disciplines and encourages the adoption of the concept of shared 

meaning.



<P>Top administrators of libraries and computing centres have a critical role to play in the successful 

implementation of collaborative projects between their respective units.  Firstly, they must share their vision 

of a project and the way in which it addresses the mission of their unit, with all staff involved; secondly, they 

must demonstrate a demeanour which discourages power struggles between the units; finally, they must make evident 

a mutual respect and help to create a climate in which others in their units can develop shared understandings.



<H2>CONCLUSION</H2> 



<P>Apart from the methods described above, there are many creative and forward-looking  ways to foster partnerships 

between librarians and information technologists. Most important, however, is to begin with an open mind and an 

attitude that each group has much to gain from the other.



<P>Successful partnerships between libraries and other professionals, such as the teaching faculty, publishers, 

media designers and instructional specialists, are also becoming increasingly common in the environment of the 

World Wide Web.  There is a strategic advantage for libraries and librarians in securing collaborative relationships 

both within the academic arena and out of it.  No one individual or profession has all of the skills now needed to 

create an information infrastructure for a community of users.



<P>In conclusion, the establishment of a collaborative relationship should provide a stake in it which relates 

to the mission of all partners.  A shared understanding of the way in which a project contributes to each partner's 

mission will have a beneficial effect on all team members and the individuals concerned must also pay as much 

attention to the relationship among the partners as to the outcome of the project.  A fundamental appreciation of 

the complementary skills of each team member - and of the viewpoints associated with them - is crucial and must be 

accompanied by open and easy communication, opportunities for mutual teaching and learning and the building of mutual 

trust and respect.  Shared meaning should be an explicit goal of the project.



<P>Finally, partners need to focus on the ultimate benefit of collaborative relationships - improved products and 

services for the community of users in an increasingly complex and sophisticated information environment.

<H1><A NAME="field"> INFORMATION SERVICES: THREAT OR OPPORTUNITY?</A> </H1> 



<H3>DR RICHARD FIELD 

Vice-Principal for Academic Services and Information Strategy, 

University of Edinburgh</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is based 

on notes taken during the presentation, and a paper supplied by the speaker.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>Information Services Directors in United Kingdom universities are now faced with a new threat: submergence in 

paper and electronic data.  The introduction of electronic aids, from publishing to e-mail, has actually increased 

the amount of information to be handled by staff and students in higher education.  This presents a very real risk 

that depth of scholarship will be subordinated to volume of activity.  Information Services Directors may actually 

be adding to the problem by their quest for improved information handling. But is it in fact a problem?  And if so, 

what should be done about it?



<H2>DEFINITIONS</H2> 



<P>It is emphasised that the views following are those of the speaker and they are not made with any reference to 

views or activities being undertaken by any other person or institution.



<P>Information is one of those words of obvious meaning: "telling", or "what is told", or "knowledge", or "items 

of knowledge", or "news".  Information services in higher education usually refers to the collection, cataloguing 

and promulgation of information, the media involved and the personnel who effect these processes.  Within this 

context, information is probably best defined as "items of knowledge" or "news".



<H2>QUESTIONS</H2> 



<P>In the area of information services, two questions need to be addressed:

<UL>

<LI>what does "Networked Information in an International Context" mean for information services?

<LI>what is being done about the threat or opportunity which this may represent?

</UL>



<H2>INFORMATION STRATEGY</H2> 



<P>The sometimes unseemly scramble at many institutions to force convergence of Library and Computing Services 

is a partial recognition of the possibilities now emerging for a management strategy for information and its 

means of distribution.  The recent JISC document on Information Strategies has focused attention on this area 

and on the need to include all sources of information in this strategy.  Thus, Library and Computing Services, 

though the main players, should be joined by MIS, Public Relations and AVS in the formulation of any information 

strategy, since they are all services in which knowledge and news play an essential role.  It is worth noting that 

although these services are already linked strategically this does not necessarily mean that their management is 

linked.  This may, however, be an outcome of an information strategy.



<H2>THE INFLUENCE OF THE WEB</H2> 



<P>The advent of Internet and the World Wide Web has changed customers' perceptions and requirements to such an 

extent that they now see many information providers (and their staff) as a hindrance rather than as a help.  

Enquiries for guidance to knowledge are being superseded by requests for connection only and this, understandably, 

is leading to severe loss of morale by dedicated library staff.



<P>In addition, information service providers are themselves being inundated by an increasing influx of information, 

both paper-based and electronic (e-mail, the Web - and even the telephone and fax).  Information professionals are 

increasingly under pressure with respect to their own information handling circumstances at a time when the need to 

understand and respond to customer needs is greater than ever.  The result is maximum activity and minimum thinking.

Sir Brian Follett remarked upon the influence of the "newspaper mentality" upon scholarly publications and voiced fears 

for their future.  In the very near future, crucial questions to consider will be:

<UL>

<LI>is the "activity effect" reducing depth of scholarship for staff and students?

<LI>is the inability of information providers to make rapid changes - exacerbated by factors such as lack of funding and, perhaps, fear of change - creating a learning gap for students?

<LI>how can these potential problems be circumvented by taking the opportunities offered by new media and materials?

</UL>



<H2>REACTION</H2> 



<P>There is a perceived move by academic professionals to contain the increased workload (the number of students, 

for example, has increased by over 50% in the last two years) by setting courses which require little or no 

supervision. This involves greater use of resource centres, or establishing them in libraries where they have not 

yet been installed.



<P>This is expected to be achieved, however, in a climate of rapidly declining financial support for capital projects 

and ever-tightening budgets - i.e. with little prospect of additional staff or other guidance resources, no new 

accommodation, or new equipment.



<P>The aspect of collaborative working by students, in project or work groups, only addresses the fringe of the 

problem.  Leaving students to find their own way through information gathering, without guidance from either 

faculty or information professionals, carries a great risk of lack of depth in scholarship.  For a university 

with a record of high achievement in research, this would be particularly galling.  To some extent this could be 

mitigated by Quality Assurance techniques, but unless a structured approach to group learning, with guidance, is 

devised, there is a very real danger that significant scholarship potential will be lost.



<H2>THREATS TO OPPORTUNITIES</H2> 



<P>Any set of problems like this invites initiatives - a chance to turn threats into opportunities.  The question, 

however, is what initiatives would be applicable?



<H3>Control</H3> 



<P>It has been suggested by many people that a way of controlling access to the Web, and of insertion of information 

into the Web, needs to be found and applied.  This would have an immediate effect on the volume issue (and calm 

senior administrators' minds regarding outsiders taking legal action against universities), but given the nature 

of the Web, and despite legislation being considered in the United Kingdom and the United States, it is not a 

practical proposition.



<H3>Co-operation and Distribution</H3> 



<P>Collaboration via network access can involve many types of organisation, including collaboration with public 

libraries, museums, television and communications companies and other educational establishments. It can also take 

many forms - the development of Metropolitan Area Networks in Scotland being a good example to emulate, and in 

particular, SCRAN, the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network.



<P>The increasing collaboration of librarians and computer professionals ("computarians") has complementary elements, 

in that librarians like to categorise while computarians like to facilitate and to control physical resources.  On the 

one hand, the free and easy access to networked information may be compromising categorisation and, on the other, the 

demise of the mainframe, coupled with on-line access and updating, may be infringing the territory of the computarian.  

Co-operation may counter these trends and reverse the loss of control which might so easily equate to loss of 

scholarship.



<H2>REVIEW</H2> 



<P>Opportunities need to be taken to review the situation in-depth (as an outcome, perhaps, of TLTP and in eLib 

- some of the projects of which deal with this theme).  There is also the prospect that digital library resources 

might change attitudes to network surfing.  At least a number of projects are pointing in the right direction.



<P>What must be prevented at all costs is centuries of scholarship becoming a "fashion boutique" occupying "niches" 

on the super highway to nowhere.

<H1><A NAME="dobson"> EMPOWERING THE MILLENNIUM CITIZEN: 

PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORKING INITIATIVES

THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MILLENNIUM PROJECT AND 

PROJECT EARL</A></H1> 



<H3>PHILIPPA DOBSON 

Public Libraries Network Adviser, LA/EARL/UKOLN</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is based on notes 

taken during the presentation, slides used, and a paper supplied by the speaker.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>For over one hundred and fifty years public libraries have been providing information to citizens in a 

friendly, open door environment.  The new superhighways have accelerated technological change and development 

of new and exciting information resources.  To help citizens to take advantage of the consequent opportunities, 

public libraries need investment from the private and public sectors to create an infrastructure of a Millennium 

Citizen Information Network.  As a first step, the Library Association has put forward a proposal to the United 

Kingdom Millennium Commission for funding for the initial development of a nation-wide infrastructure so that 

public/private partnerships can support national resource sharing and content creation.  Project EARL, a 

consortium of public libraries developing Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries, is a key partner in the 

bid.  With the aim of supporting lifelong learning, business development and community, cultural and government 

services, the Library Association and the EARL projects seek to empower the Millennium Citizen to participate 

fully and actively in the emerging technological democracies in Great Britain, Europe and beyond.



<H2>VISION</H2> 



<P>The Millennium Citizen Network will be a virtual, rather than physical, monument to the Millennium - but 

in providing equality of access to information superhighways for every citizen in the twenty-first century, 

it will have a very tangible and lasting impact.



<P>The project will be initiated by the development of resource sharing and network services between public 

library authorities.



<H2>WHY PUBLIC LIBRARIES?</H2> 



<P>Public libraries are used by more people more of the time than any other comparable institution. It is estimated 

that over 60% of the population of the United Kingdom are regular library users. As Ken Worpole put it in <CITE>Towns for 

People</CITE> (OUP 1992):



<BLOCKQUOTE>"... the central library remained the key cultural institution ... where one could find a genuine 

cross-section of people by age, class and ethnic origin."</BLOCKQUOTE> 



<P>This, backed by a hundred and fifty year tradition of providing free access to information services - with, 

now, publicly available print and electronic resources - puts public libraries in an unparalleled position to give 

universal access to knowledge.



<P>That universality will necessarily involve access to resources of all libraries.  The major obstacle to this 

goal is in the level of electronic interconnection.  Survey findings in the <CITE>Public Libraries Review</CITE> 

revealed that:



<BLOCKQUOTE>

"53% of all public libraries have some kind of Internet connection, but this is a very limited form of connection, 

both in terms of penetration and type of access"

<CITE> (Library and Information Commission Public Library Internet Survey, UKOLN, 1995).</CITE> </BLOCKQUOTE> 



<P>The position is exacerbated by local bias. Again, the <CITE>Public Libraries Review</CITE> reported:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"... many library authorities drew attention to innovations they had pioneered or developed as a "flagship" 

service, (but) there was an apparent reluctance to take up initiatives they had not initiated."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>Millennium project funding would be directly channelled to counter this low level of interconnection and low 

use of network services.



<H2>FUNDING</H2> 



<P>The Millennium Commission intends to support at least a dozen very major projects across the United Kingdom.  

Up to �50 million per project will be made available, but this will have to be matched pound-for-pound by funds 

from public and private sectors or from other funding bodies, such as

<UL>

<LI>Public Library Authorities;

<LI>Communications Industries;

<LI>European Union Information Society Initiative;

<LI>European Commission Telematics Programmes;

<LI>Department of Trade and Industry Foresight Initiative.

</UL>



<P>Another potential source would be by generation of revenue, though in its Final Report, the <CITE>Review of the 

Public Library Service in England and Wales</CITE>, undertaken in 1995 for the Department of National Heritage, 

notes that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"About two in five users tend to favour charging, but it is worth noting that the combined totals for council tax, 

a special library fund and income tax or VAT exceed the proportion favouring charging. In other words, public sector 

sources taken together attract more support than charging."

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>Other possible sources within the libraries sphere, although they can be given a direct value, are not 

strictly allowable as matched funding.  They include the creation of assets with national content and statutory 

provision of sources.  Qualification for funding will also require evidence of long term viability of the project.



<H2>TIMETABLE</H2> 



<P>The deadline for the completion of the Proposal Form was December 8th 1995 and the Application Form has to be 

submitted by 12th February 1996.  An appraisal from Technical/Financial/Commissioner viewpoints by the end of April 

1996 will lead to a long listing.  This gives a strong indication that, subject to technical adjustments, the 

project will be accepted, but it obviously does not guarantee success.



<P>The next step is a detailed appraisal, followed by shortlisting. Final acceptance will lead to the payment 

of the requested grant.



<H2>THE PROJECT</H2> 



<P>The initiative is an umbrella project (using SUSTRANS as a model) controlling many projects for the national 

co-ordination of public libraries networking.



<H3>Infrastructure</H3> 



<P>The infrastructure has to take into account:

<UL>

<LI>communications technology options, which are continually evolving;

<LI>cable (not an option for the whole of the project), BT/Mercury, satellite;

<LI>Government policy;

<LI>competition, deals and discounts - bearing in mind that this exercise presents a massive marketing opportunity.

</UL>



<P>It has, as a guide, the observation by the <CITE>Public Libraries Review</CITE> that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Infrastructure investment should be made to link central, branch and mobile public libraries and new access 

points throughout England and Wales to the information superhighways through broadband cable on Integrated Services 

Digital Network ISDN connections.  The links should provide rapid access to on-line databases and regionally based 

CD-ROM collections."</BLOCKQUOTE> 



<P>Accordingly the infrastructure will have to support:

<UL>

<LI>text and graphics, video and sound;

<LI>access to the Internet;

<LI>development of national databases (which, generally, are massive and are subject to continuous development);

<LI>commercial products, such as BT Galaxy and BT Civic;

<LI>distribution of national commercial on-line databases, such as Reuters and Dialog;

<LI>distribution of national bibliographic on-line databases, for example from The British Library;

<LI>potential for interlending between authorities, utilising standards and protocols, such as Z39.50;

<LI>connections to authorities' own networks.

</UL>



<H3>British Telecom Model</H3> 



<P>A typical type of interconnection would be that of the British Telecom connected rural/urban model to link the 

County of Norfolk and the City of Birmingham, to provide information on data, traffic, applications, addresses 

telephone numbers and opening hours.



<P>It is based on SMDS switched multi-megabit core technology to establish seamless automatic connection, on a 

"virtual" network, at the speed of the slowest link, so that any library in any authority will have access to 

all of the resources of any other library in the designated areas.



<P>The backbone of the network consists of  0.5Mbit/2.0Mbit/4.0Mbit/10.0Mbit/SMDS access points. Links from the 

libraries will be via ISDN2 (Integrated Services Digital Network) or Kilostream; links within libraries will use an 

Ethernet LAN.



<H2>PARTNERS/CO-OPERATION</H2> 



<P>The principal participants are:

<UL>

<LI>Public Library Authorities;

<LI>Project EARL;

<LI>TECHNOPOLIS;

<LI>LASER;

<LI>UKOLN;

<LI>Project EARL;

<LI>British Library.

</UL>



<P>EARL, Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries, was the first public libraries networking initiative, 

demonstrating a bottom-up approach to infrastructure.  It involves 41 public library authorities and is funded 

by subscription and by the British Library Research and Development Department.  It encompasses:

<UL>

<LI>Project EARL;EARL Connect, for connections (in association with Pipex) and advice supplied by a help desk;

<LI>Project EARL;EARL Information, on a WWW host, giving pointers to network sources, writing home pages for local authority libraries and, with OCLC Firstsearch, trialling database subscriptions;

<LI>Project EARL;EARL Development, dealing with strategic and technical issues (including the collaboration in the Millennium bid).

</UL>



<P>Further information is available from <A HREF="http://www.earl.org.uk/">http://www.earl.org.uk/</A> 



<H2>PROJECT NATIONAL CONTENT</H2> 



<P>The project will support Public Library Authority development. Its EARL and UKOLN derived framework and linking 

initiatives will promote:

<UL>

<LI>lifelong learning, by devising and distributing new learning materials, especially in the field of distance learning (of particular interest to the Open University and institutions such as the Royal College of Nursing, the library of which has been dr





amatically cut);

<LI>the key area of imparting skills to the workforce - library staff and public - via electronic libraries programme training initiatives, NVQs and input/output centres (twelve of which are projected by the end of 1996 to give access to training for memb





ers of the public, such as those not familiar with the Internet);

<LI>business intelligence, via a business information network and Business Links;

<LI>National imagination and memory, e.g. a national archive similar to SCRAN, the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network;

<LI>Empowering the citizen, with access to Government information and the Government Centre for Information Systems (CCTA);

<LI>Teleshopping, via public access kiosks.

</UL>



<H2>THE WAY FORWARD</H2> 



<P>Essentially this covers the short term, February to April 1996, ensuring that the project is prepared with:

<UL>

<LI>a management structure;

<LI>the project core team;

<LI>completed technical and financial studies;

<LI>marketing the concept;

<LI>lobbying more effectively and involving political parties.

</UL>



<P>Finally, the <CITE>Public Libraries Review</CITE> once more encapsulates the way forward that the project represents:

"Library authorities should retain the option to levy charges for new added value services.  However, we believe 

that there is a case for allowing uncharged access to Internet or World Wide Web sources that are essentially free - 

that is, available at no more than the cost of local calls to telecommunications nodes."

<!-- /BLOCKQUOTE -->



<P>The importance of universal access to knowledge for the citizen of the twenty-first century cannot be overstated.  

Nor can there be a better monument to the Millennium than the means by which it can be created.

<H1><A NAME="ferguson"> THE SUBJECT APPROACH TO NETWORK NAVIGATION</A></H1> 



<H3>NICKY FERGUSON, Project Director, SOSIG</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is based 

on notes taken during the presentation and slides used.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>Despite the growth of the WWW, despite its ease of use and despite the proliferation of search tools, 

there is still a need for human intervention to guide the search process by adding judgmental information.  

SOSIG is the first of a series of subject-based gateways under construction in the UK.  SOSIG has been running 

for 18 months and is piloting an approach to classification and description which allows the information to reside 

at appropriate centres of expertise.  This expertise will be made available to user in a transparent and distributed 

way.



<H2>BACKGROUND</H2> 



<P>Until about two years ago, we had to put up with a variety of complex interfaces for Internet services.  Not 

only were interfaces inconsistent, but addresses were constantly changing.  We had Gophers galore - frequently 

highly nested - and the X.25 communications, incompatible with direct Internet use, which the UK academic community 

was using.



<P>Typically, users went through three phases of network awareness.  First, before network training,  

"machine-phobia", as they were sceptical of the use of the Internet.  Then, b after their initial training, 

came a period of "network-o-philia" as they became excited by the possibilities of Internet research.  Sadly, 

the third phase, "getting lost" followed soon after as the degree of difficulty of locating resources became 

apparent, the enthusiasm being lost in proportion.



<P>This gave rise to the concept of the "subject gateway", being a meta-resource which provides links to data 

resources in a particular domain, in an organised manner.



<H3>The Situation Today</H3> 



<P>Today's hyper-linked WWW network cuts through the hierarchical nests which proved so confusing.  WWW is 

pervasive, as is its use.  It is increasingly populated with a variety of search engines and "robots" which make 

searching easier.  And for those who are still struggling. there are many "idiot's guides" available to help.  It 

would therefore be understandable to question the need for further subject gateways.



<H2>WHY GATEWAYS?</H2> 



<P>Despite the advances of the WWW, searching the Internet is still problematic.  The search tools which exist are 

still primitive; for example, they often return large numbers of "hits" in response to search enquiries.  In practice, 

serendipity and browsing are insufficient, even augmented by today's tools.  There is still a need for human selection 

and expertise to assist the search process; and that is precisely what a subject gateway offers.



<H2>SOSIG</H2> 



<P>SOSIG - the Social Science Information Gateway - (pronounced "sausage") is designed to be the first stop for 

Social Scientists on the Internet.  Its key attributes are to provide a consistent interface, and to deal with 

information issues which include:

<UL>

<H3>Resources</H3> 



<P>The resources linked by the gateway include mailing lists, newsgroups, printed guides and catalogues, and 

networked search tools.  The resources included have been "filtered" in accordance with a developed policy.  

This policy is qualitative, emphasising the value added by human involvement in the maintenance of the gateway.  

The aim is to make the gateway comprehensive for UK resources.



<P>Resources are classified according to their UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) code, with some 

cross-referencing.  The lists can be viewed in alphabetical order or by UDC (users almost always choose the 

former, which is the default).



<H3>SOSIG Records</H3> 



<P>Each resource identified in SOSIG is described in one record.  The records, based on IAFA templates, 

describing a resource in the SOSIG gateway include:

<UL>

<LI>a URL;

<LI>keywords;

<LI>resource type;

<LI>contact information;

<LI>description.

</UL>



<P>The descriptions clearly are central to the success of the enterprise.  Some are contributed by owners of the 

resources, others are developed by the SOSIG team.



<P>These records underlie the search facility, and automatically create the browsable classified collection.



<H2>EXAMPLES</H2> 



<P>SOSIG has been used in practice to answer an impressive range of questions and enquiries.  Some real life examples include:

<UL>

<LI>Is there  World Bank field office in Zimbabwe?  If so, where?

<LI>Does the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) report make any mention of the poorest countries in the world?

<LI>A colleague was in Nicaragua some years ago and now wants to update her knowledge of the economy.

<LI>A researcher doing work with non-governmental organisations wants to find out about the proposed UN summit for Social development in 1995.

</UL>



<H2>THE FUTURE</H2> 



<P>The main ongoing effort is to make SOSIG a test site for the ROADS system <A HREF="uk-9602-report.html#1"> [1]</A>.  

There are also efforts under way to 

encourage the creation and recording of new Social Sciences resources, including non-networked resources.



<P>The project team strongly believes in remembering that "It's the data, stupid" - in other words, we must remember that the information is prime, not the technology.

It is also essential to avoid being tied to particular standards, protocols or technologies - they change too often.



<P>The amount of effort expended on maintaining the gateway is large, especially so given the breadth of the subject covered.  This is giving rise to some concerns, and we are proposing to devolve some of the work to subject experts.

Finally, there is the inevitable question of funding.  Present funding is provided by the eLib programme; but this is finite.  The source of funds for continued operation will have to be determined.

<H1><A NAME="dempsey"> RESOURCE ORGANISATION AND DISCOVERY IN

SUBJECT-BASED SERVICES</A></H1> 



<H3>LORCAN DEMPSEY, Director, UKOLN</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on notes taken during the presentation and on the slides used.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 

<P>This paper describes the genesis, objectives, and status of the ROADS - Resource Organisation and Discovery 

in Subject-based Services - project.  Key issues raised by the project are examined, and possible future actions 

are sketched out.



<H2>GENESIS OF ROADS</H2> 



<P>The project emerged from a recognition of the need for an easy way of locating Internet resources.  The idea 

hinges on the use of simple Internet resource descriptions, which will allow users easily to retrieve information 

from distributed autonomously managed resources.  The idea was incorporated into a proposal for eLib funding; ISSC 

has funded the project for two years, to develop a suite of services which support resource discovery.



<H3>Project Roles</H3> 



<P>The University of Bristol is acting as project co-ordinator.  This involves looking after the liaison, the 

documentation, and other project management tasks.  Key personnel are Nicky Ferguson, Chris Osborne and Phil Hobbes.



<P>UKOLN is providing metadata research, and work on user requirements, WWW issues and the interoperability of MARC 

and Z39.50.  Key personnel are Rachel Heery and John Kirriemuir.



<P>Technical development is taking place at Loughborough University, where the key contacts are Jon Knight and 

Martin Hamilton.



<H2>OBJECTIVES</H2> 



<H3>A Significant Contribution</H3> 



<P>The first objective is to make a meaningful contribution to the development of a sharable, distributed systems 

platform for resource discovery services.  In fact, it will achieve more, as some services are actually being developed.



<P>The project is based on the avoidance of idiosyncratic components, and so a number of pragmatic choices have been 

made.  The work will build on:

<UL>

<LI>IAFA WHOIS++ templates (an emerging Internet service);

<LI>Centroids, an indexing protocol which presents forward knowledge (this will be implemented later).

</UL>



<H3>Support Emerging Services</H3> 



<P>Several eLib projects are developing new subject-based services.  The second objective is to support these 

projects with tools, advice and guidelines.  Examples of the projects are:

<UL>

<LI>SOSIG, OMNI: these are both trialling ROADS;

<LI>EEVL, ADAM, IHR: use of ROADS by these projects is in the planning stages; it is anticipated that at least two of these projects are likely to use ROADS;

<LI>CAIN, RUDI: these two projects are considering ROADS, and may use it in part.

</UL>



<H3>Make Resources as Useful and Accessible as Possible</H3> 



<P>The third objective is to work with subject-based services to involve information providers in the description 

of their own resources, in order to make them as useful and accessible as possible.  Early on, a decision was taken 

that there would be a need for tools to allow information providers to document their resources.  The "trusted 

information provider" and ALIWEB models are both under consideration; quality of documentation remains a concern, 

and is a constant issue.



<H3>Participate in Standards Activities</H3> 



<P>There is a perception that the UK does not participate enough in international standards setting work.  Partly in 

response, the fourth objective of ROADS is to implement and test emerging standards, and to increase the level of UK 

participation in standards work.  Accordingly, Loughborough University is working on the development of WHOIS++ and 

the uniform resource initiatives (UR*); UKOLN is working on metadata research, and is organising (jointly with OCLC) 

a metadata workshop which will follow on from the recent meeting in Dublin (Ohio) which resulted in the "Dublin Core".  

The workshop will be held in Warwick in April 1996.



<H2>STATUS</H2> 



<P>The project started in August 1995.



<P>The current version of ROADS software is referred to as v.0.  It includes an IAFA-based search engine, and has 

given rise to much discussion on the ideal template contents.



<P>The next step is ROADS v.1, which is expected in late the Summer of 1996.  It will be a standalone WHOIS++ 

implementation.



<P>By the end of 1996, ROADS v.2 should be available.  This will implement a fully distributed environment, with 

Centroids.  It will allow a single entry point to one server, which refers the enquirer to the specialist server 

which is most likely to be useful.



<H2>ISSUES AND FUTURES</H2> 



<P>The ROADS team recognises that a plurality of protocols will be used for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, as 

part of the project, it is planned to develop a small demonstrator which will show interoperability between services 

based on Z39.50 and MARC.



<P>The project team sincerely hopes that the experience gained so far, and experience to be gathered in the remainder 

of the ROADS project, will feed back into ongoing discussion and development in this area.  One of the debating 

points which has already arisen is the need for a Simple Internet Resource Description.



<P>A key question concerns the practicality of providing this prototype for a distributed directory service.  The use 

of Centroids will need to be tested, as will questions associated with the inclusion of data from domains other than 

the limited selection currently incorporated.



<P>Finally, there is the possibility of integrating the ROADS scenario to take in other, non-Internet resources, such 

as business data.

<H1><A NAME="lynch"> A SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS OF

CNI'S NIDR RESEARCH INITIATIVE</A></H1> 



<H3>CLIFFORD LYNCH, Director, Library Automation, University of California</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on notes taken during the presentation.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>In this paper, some of the preliminary findings of the CNI working party on networked information discovery 

and retrieval (NIDR) are discussed.  They include consideration of cost and usage, of cataloguing and metadata.  

A number of significant gaps requiring further work are highlighted.



<H2>BACKGROUND</H2> 



<P>The thinking in this paper is shaped by research conducted for the CNI white paper  on information discovery 

and retrieval<A HREF="uk-9602-report.html#1"> [1]</A>.  This work was initiated when the CNI was approached by Avra Michelson of the MITRE Corporation, 

who crystallised the need for research in this area. In late 1994 CNI formed a team, including the author, 

Craig Summerhill from CNI and Cecilia Preston; the work was co-sponsored by the MITRE Corporation.  This team 

has held meetings and discussions, and currently is drafting its paper.



<P>It is gratifying to note that some of the team's early predictions are already beginning to become reality.



<H2>THE PROBLEM</H2> 



<P>A major question at the outset is how to impose some sort of structure on the discovery and retrieval "problem".  

Predicting how it is likely to evolve is also a fruitful source of debate.  Because of the scope and size of the 

issues, the team consciously avoided current detailed or technical points; it tried instead to determine where work 

will be needed strategically in the future, on concerns  such as protocols, metadata taxonomies, etc.



<H2>FINDINGS</H2> 



<H3>Assumptions about Costs of Information</H3> 



<P>The first generation of networked information discovery and retrieval (NIDR) tools were predicated on the 

concept that "content is free".  For example, tools such as Web Crawlers would search and index network servers 

systematically, assuming that they would find information which is freely available.  However, this will change 

(in fact, it has already begun to change).  The content of the Internet of the future will not all be free; it 

will contain a complex mix of proprietary and non-proprietary information.  As the proportion of information 

which is charged for increases, so the impact on NIDR tools will increase too.



<H3>Intranets</H3> 



<P>We are already starting to see the evolution of complex and information-rich organisational information spaces.  

These can be described as Intranets, that is a part of the Internet which is internal to an organisation and 

segregated from the bulk of the Internet by a firewall.  As this trend continues, organisations will store more and 

more of their internal data in their Intranets while simultaneously relying on other Internet resources for external 

data.  The impact will be that owners of Intranets will demand consistent tools for Intranet and Internet use.  This 

will attract major software vendors to the NIDR marketplace.  We are already seeing some software houses trying to 

squeeze revenue from the Intranet  phenomenon.



<H3>Fitness for Use</H3> 



<P>Discovery is conceptually straightforward - it consists of finding an appropriate network location, then 

identifying the required information.  Similarly, retrieval is simple - it only requires a collection of bits 

to be moved to the desired location.  However, a complication arises because retrieval is not equivalent to use.  

For example, in today's software environment, it is easy enough to retrieve a resource only to find that the 

"helper application" needed to use the resource is not available.  We anticipate that this gap between retrieval 

and use will grow and will become more and more significant.  Accordingly, the concept of "fitness for use" will 

become more important.



<H3>Factors Affecting Discovery</H3> 



<P>Today, information needs in the NIDR environment are typically formulated in terms of intellectual content 

description.  In the future environment, other factors will become important: access time, service levels, price, 

and formats.  Future tools will need to take these more mechanical factors into account.



<H3>Digital Libraries</H3> 



<P>From the outset, the team felt that the subject of discovery in a network context would be crucial.  It remains 

very significant, but its importance is decreasing because of the growth of digital libraries.  As a matter of 

definition, digital libraries are established by individuals or bodies who care enough about their contents to build, 

maintain and - in some cases - describe.  It follows that for many users, the task of network discovery will be reduced 

to finding the best digital library, then searching within it.  This will make discovery much easier than it is at 

present.



<P>Of course, network discovery technologies will be needed for use within the digital libraries, but the libraries will 

impose constraints and simplifications which will facilitate the process.



<P>Digital libraries will not meet all users' needs.  There will remain a core of users who will need to search the 

entire Internet routinely.  In the main, these will be users who deal in "raw" information, for example in law 

enforcement, research, and corporate research.  Generally these users will be well-informed and sophisticated users 

of network tools.



<H3>Moving beyond the Library Cataloguing Model</H3> 



<P>Most searching approaches and activities are heavily influenced by the nature of online cataloguing.  However, 

online catalogues have several weaknesses as information systems; the weaknesses include lack of memory concerning 

previous searches, and the lack of personalisation features.  Unfortunately, these weaknesses are being carried 

forward into NIDR systems.  Clearly we need to move beyond the current model.  What is needed is a move towards a 

more active model which involves the "push" distribution of information by systems which learn and become personalised 

through use.



<P>The cataloguing tradition is non-evaluative (which is superficially attractive as it seems to suggest cataloguing 

by unskilled personnel, something which does not work well in practice); but a purely descriptive approach has very 

real limitations which prevent the catalogue from answering evaluative questions which users would like to be able 

to ask.  For example, users would like to ask questions such as "what is the best reference?" or 

"which is more relevant?"  Because of these limitations, NIDR suffers from a perception that 

"catalogues don't do this!"



<P>Potentially, there are fortunes to be made by entrepreneurs who successfully depart from the conventional 

catalogue model to meet users' needs and desires more fully.



<H3>Retrieval</H3> 



<P>The architectural model used to conceptualise the retrieval component of NIDR today is still dominated by the 

view of the world imposed by the file transfer protocol (FTP), which is twenty years old.  This model views 

retrieval as the process of moving a file - a collection of bits - from one place to another.  It lacks the 

concept of content at an intellectual level.  This concept recognises that content can be represented through a 

variety of digital representations - formats, resolutions, etc - which might be selected based on the capabilities 

of the client and server involved in the retrieval and the network linking the two, as well as the ultimate needs 

of the person who will use the intellectual content.  Protocols more modern than FTP, such as Z39.50, allow much 

more negotiation about format as part of retrieval; indeed, retrieval becomes a process rather than a simple action.



<P>The very simplistic view of retrieval today has also confused a number of issues related to metadata.  There is a 

tendency to consider information related to a digital object (price, format etc) as static information that can be 

viewed as metadata associated with the object rather than as more transitory and situational parameters that are 

established in the context of a specific retrieval of the object.



<H3>Revenue Model</H3> 



<P>Today, retrieval normally assumes acquisition for digital information in the sense of physically copying the 

information to the users' machine.  The legal framework for networked information use has largely shifted from 

purchase of copies to licenses to use copies.  Retrieval will need to be extended to also allow the negotiation 

and signing of licenses, not simply the transfer of funds to pay for an object.  In the near future we are likely 

to see a much richer and more complex set of use options for information than simply making local copies; this 

will include:

<UL>

<LI>techniques for viewing one time "performances" of objects over the network;

<LI>watermarking or serial numbering of copies through steganographic technologies;

<LI>use of envelope or secure container technologies through which encrypted objects are transmitted to a user along with programs which decode them (in very controlled ways), and which meter, report on and bill for use on a transactional basis.

</UL>



<H3>Collection of Metadata</H3> 



<P>The structures used for the collection of metadata will necessarily grow more complex.  For the last few years, 

we have seen Web Crawlers trawling the network to derive descriptive metadata, following the model that was 

established by the archie system for indexing FTP archives.  As alluded to earlier, this is not well suited 

to a network which contains valuable proprietary information; but, paradoxically, the owners of that information 

will have a vested interest in publicising the existence and nature of their information while still retaining 

control over it.  We conclude that a new series of interface points will emerge where suppliers will interact 

with search engines.  Quite possibly this will require new levels of abstraction. Users will not be satisfied 

solely with metadata provided by the information suppliers, which often is basically advertising; the more 

neutral information extracted from indexing and cataloguing processes will still be needed.



<H3>Defining Metadata</H3> 



<P>Metadata presents a complex set of ill-defined issues.  The team spent considerable time looking at  metadata 

issues; our conclusion was that to a great extent the view of information as metadata is highly contextual, 

depending on specific usage scenarios. Also, the linkage between metadata and the base object that metadata 

describes is elusive and becoming more blurred as technologies for automatic indexing, abstracting, translation, 

image recognition and similar processes improve.



<P>With only limited research, we found no fewer than ten metadata mapping schemes.  Mapping metadata between 

these schemes is imperfect at best; this represents a gap which should be filled.



<P>One current trend is to try to define "core sets" of metadata, on the premise that agreeing the bottom layer of a 

conceptual hierarchy of metadata sets will permit some form of interoperability between models.  Unfortunately 

this premise overlooks the critical weakness that it is impossible to rebuild a full metadata set starting from 

a core set; this weakness diminishes the value of the concept.



<P>The compromise approach of lowest common denominator core sets of metadata also gives rise to another problem.  

While it is possible, through approaches such as the "Dublin Core" work, to develop reasonable core sets and gain 

consensus around them, they are not particularly interpretable or interoperable at the machine level.  Typically, 

the data elements are not highly structured and are going to be used with free text searching and presented to people 

for decision making.



<H2>THE FUTURE</H2> 



<P>There is currently much talk about "intelligent agents", about sophisticated semantic interoperability.  The 

current view of NIDR presumes the active, continual involvement of a human to control the process and to make 

complex decisions involving relatively unstructured information.  A world of intelligent agents would have to 

rely on highly structured data and data interchange standards.  In this sense, current NIDR technology is 

largely disconnected from the development of intelligent agents and focused on solving a different problem.

SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION: 

DEVELOPING AN ELECTRONIC COMMUNITY</A></H1> 



<H3>PROFESSOR DOV GABBAY,  Imperial College, London and PROFESSOR HANS J�RGEN OHLBACH, Max Planck Institut f�r Informatik, Saarbr�cken</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  It is based on notes 

taken during the presentation, slides used, and notes supplied by the speaker.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>IGPL, the Interest Group on Pure and Applied Logic, is an international association of almost one thousand 

logicians from almost all the countries of the world.  The Interest Group is an excellent testbed for developing an 

"electronic community", i.e. a community of researchers communicating in various ways over the Internet.  As part of 

the services it provides for its members, IGPL publishes an electronic journal and is developing an electronic 

dictionary of logic - a distributed, refereed, dynamically updated and highly interactive database of information 

concerning scientific knowledge on logic.  In contrast to current searching on the World Wide Web, where locating 

particular information can often be more a result of chance than choice, the logic database will facilitate easy 

and accurate access to the area of interest.  A database of this scope cannot be set up by a single author, nor even 

by a small group, and consequently a scheme is being devised to encourage participation by the whole of the IGPL 

community.  Such a scheme need not be confined to logic, but could be extended to a wider scientific domain, provided 

that support from the research community is forthcoming.



<H2>THE IGPL</H2> 



<P>Logic is an interdisciplinary subject, with a long tradition, from Aristotle onwards, of providing foundations 

for examining problems in Philosophy, Mathematics, Language, Psychology and, latterly, in Computer Science and 

Artificial intelligence.  In the late 1970s it became clear to many members of the research community that there 

were many similarities in the way logic is used and applied by otherwise very diverse factions.  It was apparent 

that a great deal of mutual benefit would result from bringing these disparate groups together and establishing 

means by which they could communicate and collaborate.



<P>A series of handbooks was published in the 1980s covering, in a thematic and co-operative manner, many of the 

research areas of logic.  Currently, over twelve volumes have been published and this number is already planned to 

rise to forty volumes, with over twenty thousand pages, by the year 2001.  A consequence of the intensive 

collaborative work of many scientists on these handbooks was the formation of a community of like-minded individuals.  

It was a natural step, therefore, to found an electronic network and an electronic journal to serve this community - 

a community which, in the early 1990s became the Interest Group on Pure and Applied Logic, IGPL.



<P>The IGPL is sponsored by FoLLI, the European Association for Logic, Language and Information and currently has a 

membership of almost one thousand researchers in various aspects of logic from about forty different countries.  

Acting mainly as a research and information clearing house, its activities include:

<UL>

<LI>exchanging information on research problems, references and areas of common interest;

<LI>obtaining and forwarding copies of documents (subject to copyright), especially where there are difficulties of access;

<LI>supplying review copies of books via journals edited by members;

<LI>helping to arrange exchange visits and workshops;

<LI>advising on papers for publication;

<LI>keeping a public archive of papers, abstracts, etc., accessible via FTP;

<LI>obtaining discounts on publications concerning logic;

<LI>editing and distributing a newsletter and a journal.

</UL>



<H2>TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE</H2> 



<P>Until the advent of electronic communications, scientific knowledge was generally imparted via journals, textbooks, 

conference proceedings, dictionaries, encyclopaedias and handbooks.  The problem with this approach was that it 

tended to be chaotic, particularly if a particular piece of information was required, searching was very time-consuming 

and the data was static, with no updates and no animations.



<P>On the publishing side, there were long delays - two years was not uncommon and this often fatally compromised the 

currency of the subject matter - and large backlogs of papers for publication. Economic factors also limited the size 

of papers to less than one hundred and fifty pages. Even when people independently put items on to an electronic 

network the quality was extremely variable, in a discipline where consistently high standards were paramount.



<P>By 1993, however, IGPL had developed the infrastructure which would enable them to eliminate these problems by 

publishing their own, electronic, journal.



<H2>THE JOURNAL</H2> 



<P>IGPL's <CITE>Journal</CITE> is published several times per year.  It was the first scientific journal on logic to be electronic 

in all departments (a hardcopy version is produced, but only in response to specific demand).  Submission, refereeing, 

revising, typesetting, checking proofs and distribution are all accomplished via electronic mailing and publishing.



<P>Each issue currently has about a thousand pages, and invites papers dealing with all areas of pure and applied 

logic, including pure logical systems, proof theory, model theory, recursion theory, type theory, non-classical logics, 

non-monotonic logic, numerical and uncertainty reasoning, artificial intelligence, foundations of logical programming, 

computation, language and logic engineering.



<P>Although there are some residual problems in the realm of costs and charging policy, copyright, rate and type of 

expansion and technical development, most have been dealt with (in regard to copyright, for example, no restriction 

is placed on authors who wish to publish the same work elsewhere).  Two major objectives have been realised: the 

average speed of publication has been reduced from two years to two months and the <CITE>Journal</CITE> provides encouragement 

for logicians to communicate with each other - an aspect which has been furthered by another IGPL activity: the 

logic dictionary.



<H2>THE ELECTRONIC DICTIONARY OF LOGIC</H2> 



<P>The dictionary is intended as a distributed dynamic Internet archive, residing on the World Wide Web and 

continuously maintained by the IGPL community.  Its goals will include:

<UL>

<LI>content oriented searches, with information entered by experts in a manner which will facilitate specific searches;

<LI>up-to-date information;

<LI>reliable (and therefore reviewed) information;

<LI>high quality;

<LI>automated maintenance;

<LI>various other services, associated with information filtering.

</UL>



<P>Communication will be via HTML forms and the submission of contributions, editing (both on a general and 

topic level) and the refereeing process will be open, simple to access and easy to manipulate.  Services will 

include search facilities, automatic notification by e-mail of new items and a referees database.



<P>IGPL is tasked with establishing the dictionary and its procedures, means and tools for maintenance, operation 

and evolution, both in electronic and social terms. There are two primary objectives:

<UL>

<LI>every user of the Web should be able to locate particular logic information as quickly and as accurately as possible, by a few mouse clicks and minimal keywords entered into a standard Web browser;

<LI>the maintenance and growth of the dictionary should be independent of any central authority.

</UL>



<H2>THE VISION</H2> 



<P>The IGPL has indeed developed an electronic community, effectively eliminating distance as a barrier to 

access to information, ideas, expertise and people with similar interests.  By the year 2001 that community 

will directly link the student at home with the world of logic, with the dictionary of logic knowledge, with 

the twenty thousand pages of the logic handbooks and with a society with interests centred around logic.

It is estimated that there are perhaps only ten thousand people world-wide directly working in the logic domain.  

But logic is a junction which impinges on and influences many more subject areas.  In that respect the IGPL will 

reach out to and provide services for a vast audience for whom electronic communications will be the predominant 

means of knowledge access in the twenty-first century.

<H3>DAVID W KOEHLER, Director of Distributed Management Systems, Princeton University</H3> 



<P><EM>This account was drafted for this report by The Marc Fresko Consultancy.  

It is based on notes taken during the presentation and slides used.</EM> 



<H2>ABSTRACT</H2> 



<P>The introduction of the Mosaic browser ignited a fire of interest that has changed the face of the Internet and 

the way we deal with networked information.  The scramble for commercial success on the Internet has brought many 

technology vendors into the Web trade, resulting in the proliferation of new tools and methods.  As these advances 

define the role of commerce on the Internet, they will also change the way in which routine business is conducted 

on networked campuses.



<H2>ADMINISTRATIVE COMPUTING VIEWPOINTS</H2> 



<P>On the campus, administrative computing has traditionally occupied a prominent central position with a strong 

operational focus. It has mainframe orientation, supporting on-line terminals and it is characterised by a 

superlative levels of security and reliability - the latter in excess of 99&#37;.



<P>An alternative opinion, however, is that it has become boring and outdated, is invariably weighed down by huge 

backlogs of work, takes too long to respond and has poor accessibility, since it has to have an intermediary between 

its operation and those who want results from it.



<P>Unfavourable comparisons between its nature and performance and that of the dinosaurs, just after their 350 million 

year reign, have been offered.



<H2>CLIENT/SERVER</H2> 



<P>The latest phenomenon is Client/Server architecture, which has swept in with the kind of speed expected of new 

technology and is busy replacing all administration systems, to a greater or lesser degree.  Its characteristics 

are that it is extremely effective and highly efficient.



<P>Effectiveness is epitomised by the fact that it provides information for decision makers immediately, is adept 

at supporting new users and can accommodate many thousands of users, rather than the couple of hundred maximum 

on-line to a mainframe.  Its efficiency is derived from its ability to break down organisational layers and put 

power and accountability at local levels, to provide integrated solutions, with one view of the world and one 

place for base information, and to reduce redundancy by its distributed system approach.



<P>In investigating Client/Server applicability the prospective user should consider:

<UL>

<LI>using relational DBMS and SQL;

<LI>using a shadow database and leave existing data in place;

<LI>emphasising decision support as a primary benefit;

<LI>acquiring new development tools;

<LI>fully retraining staff;

<LI>establishing an infrastructure, based on access from terminals in respect of the software distribution and version, directory, authentication of user and authorisation;

</UL>

and

<UL>

<LI>committing a great deal of budget to its implementation.

</UL>

</P>



<H2>THE WEB DIMENSION</H2> 



<P>The World Wide Web, however, has introduced a new dimension to information technology.  It is very open, very 

public, ubiquitous, extremely easy to access, carries an unbelievable amount of information, eliminates distance 

and is, frankly, fun to use.



<P>The applications which it can accommodate are practically infinite. Examples in academia, especially the 

university library environment, include:

<UL>

<LI>general university and library services information;

<LI>On-line Public Access Catalogues;

<LI>university phone book queries;

<LI>classified ads;

<LI>"zoom-in" and progressive component selection of grounds, buildings and other structures - the capability, for example, to examine a building by sequentially moving in from an aerial photograph to the exterior views of the building itself and onwards 





to plans or views of individual rooms;

<LI>news, information, electronic journals.

</UL>



<H2>MERGER</H2> 



<P>A merger of information services and administration will see a combination of Client/Server and Web benefits. 

It will bring multi-platform access, with, for example, compatibility between Apple Macintoshes and Unix PCs.  

Common Graphical User Interfaces, using HTML, will help in this respect.  Using the Web to deliver documents 

will provide an efficient and low-cost option and, indeed, the Web represents low-cost client software, in this 

form of Client/Server hybrid, and the interactive nature of the Web would tend to make the whole system 

self-documenting and self-training.



<H2>CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</H2> 



<P>The mainframe operating environment still predominates, with investment locked in and legacy systems which 

change very little, if at all, over very long periods.  In regard to performance, most mainframes have problems 

coping with more than a very few hundred on-line users and the prospect of thousands of users simultaneously 

logged on would not appear to be practical.  The problems of security, with open access, are obvious and somewhat 

formidable.



<P>Solutions are at hand, however.  The mainframe can be adapted as a server in the Client/Server environment.  

Rather than attempt the daunting task of conversion, the legacy data can be filtered and interpreted when necessary.  

With respect to performance, it is expectations rather than actual response time which are important and these are 

currently being set by the Internet, where delays of five or six seconds are tolerated.



<P>Security can be resolved, though perhaps not to a highly secure standard, by, for example, positioning a Secure 

Socket Layer (SSL) between the browser and a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and applying encryption technology at the 

SSL level.



<H2>WEB CLIENT/SERVER</H2> 



<P>One of the first advantages of utilising the Web in a Client/Server environment is that the database 

technology does not have to be changed, yet users have real time access to real, operational data. Interpretive 

servers, also, make users feel comfortable by providing familiarity.  The retraining associated with conventional 

implementation of new Client/Server systems is not necessary on the Web, where ease of use and a philosophy of 

"just do it" predominate and update of user entered information is so simple and direct that information such as 

student addresses tends to be more up-to-date and accurate, yet requires no administrative resource.



<H2>THE WEB IN THE NINETIES</H2> 



<P>Whether the Web is the ultimate destination of information technology or not remains to be seen, but taking 

advantage of it now in administrative computing is at the very least an astute interim strategy.  It may well be - 

as happened at Princeton in December 1995 - that the biggest problem will be in selecting the application with 

which to start the process.  Once commenced, however, it can be expected that implementation will be fast, 

investment will be encouraged and thousands of new users can be connected, with virtually no training costs.  

Perhaps one of the most important effects of the Web is its ability to act as a smile generator.  What may seem to 

be a trivial characteristic can prove to be very useful at times of great change, which the Web will - and is already 

- bringing to campuses world-wide.
