<p>Couched in a new framework of interaction between Africa, industrialised countries, and multilateral organisations like the World Bank, the New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development (Nepad) has been promoted at all major world economic gatherings since its launch in October 2001.  At corporate globalisation forums like the G8 meetings, its advocates have likened Nepad to the Marshal Plan that resurrected Europe after World War Two, claiming that Africa&#039;s present development status is as a result of insufficient globalisation, and the therapy is to integrate Africa further into the global economy.  By this strategy, can Africa truly claim this millennium?  Nowhere is an answer more obvious than in the energy sector, the cornerstone of Nepad.  <br />
<br />
Energy is of premier importance for economic development in Africa.  With global business opportunities totalling trillions of dollars, energy is one of the biggest businesses in the world.  In particular, energy consumption in developed countries is expected to swell significantly in the years ahead.  With these rosy business prospects, Nepad intends to use energy as a launch pad for Africa into the global economy.  Against this, and despite the rich and diverse sources of energy on the continent, per capita consumption of energy in Africa is the least in the world, fronting energy poverty at the root cause of underdevelopment.  With about 40 to 45% of the 730 million people in Africa living on less than a dollar a day, access, affordability, and efficiency are the tenets on which any strategy that will align Africa&#039;s energy economy on a path to sustainable development must be judged.  <br />
<br />
Although Nepad makes a token reference to the need to guarantee a sustainable supply of affordable energy as the cornerstone for poverty alleviation, projects envisaged to operationalise the goal run opposite to the energy needs of the majority of Africa&#039;s inhabitants.  The short-term action plan to dually anchor sustainable energy development and serve as building blocks to the realisation of medium to long-term goals are power systems, and oil and gas transmission projects.  The power projects include the Mepanda Uncua Hydro Power Plant, Ethiopia-Sudan Interconnection, West Africa Power Pool (WAAP) Program, Algeria-Morocco-Spain Interconnection, Algeria-Spain Interconnection, Algeria Gas-fired Power Station, and the Mozambique-Malawi Interconnection.  The gas and oil transmission projects include: the Kenya-Uganda Oil Pipeline, West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP), and the Libya-Tunisia Gas Pipeline.  Firmed on the profiteering devotion of multinational corporations, are these projects really relevant to Africa&#039;s development aspirations?  Alternatively, will they actually meet the energy needs and aspirations of present and future generations?  This article attempts an answer by calibrating the projects on the following sustainability scales: <br />
<br />
AFFORDABILITY: PUTTING PROFITS AHEAD OF PEOPLE<br />
<br />
The power projects mentioned highlight an unbowed agenda to centralise the supply of electricity in the continent.  The seed capital for these projects is the sweeping wave of privatisation of State Owned Enterprises (SOE&#039;s) across Africa.  Through policy-based lending, most African countries are subscribing to the dictates of international institutions like the World Bank to open the energy sector to foreign investment through privatisation and deregulation.  In these circumstances, electricity is treated as a commodity rather than a public service.  Hence, the hallmarks of SOE&#039;s such as universal service, non-discriminatory pricing between industrial and residential users, and cross-subsidies to urban poor and rural populations are substituted for full cost recovery, the credo of privatised utilities.  <br />
<br />
At the same time, and in order to maximise profits, multinational corporations are exploring opportunities to transcend geographical barriers.  Anchored in neo-liberalism, the Nepad action plan facilitates the lifting of geographical restrictions on electricity trade across Africa.  It is worth noting that this is inimical to the livelihoods of the majority of Africans living below two dollars a day.  Besides paying the real cost for electricity, unreliable consumers will be priced out of the grid.  In sum, markets and customers in the Nepad action plan take precedence over citizenship. <br />
<br />
ACCESSIBILITY: NO ROOM FOR RURAL ELECTRIFICATION <br />
<br />
Access to electricity services is a clear marker of the difference between the rich and the poor, between men and women.  In fact, 80% of the 500 million Africans without access to electricity live in rural areas.  In particular, the rural electrification rate of 16.9% in Africa is the least in the world.  The lack of electricity correlates with many indicators of poverty such as poor education, inadequate health care, and hardships imposed on women and children.  Electricity services can indeed enhance the quality of life of rural populations in countless ways.  For instance: electric light extends the day, providing extra hours for reading and improving exam results in rural areas; refrigeration allows rural clinics to keep needed medicines such as vaccines; and solar dryers can lead to lower post-harvest losses and enable rural farmers to market their produce when prices are higher. <br />
<br />
Because of the rates of poverty and low population density in rural areas, relying on grid solutions for lights on is a sure course for lights off.  In fact, the energy needs of rural Africa are decentralised.  Meeting the energy needs of rural populations requires the exploration of renewable energy sources.  In contrast, the Nepad action plan prioritises the centralisation of power supply, the opposite of the decentralised energy needs of rural masses.  Driven by profits, privatised utilities have no incentive to extend networks to rural areas, unless government subsidies make up for the financial loses and provide an attractive margin of profit.  It is worth noting that the neo-liberal fountain from which Nepad draws its viability is at odds with subsidies.  In fact, governments are compelled to shirk their social responsibilities thereby leaving rural populations permanently unconnected to the grid.  <br />
<br />
EFFICIENCY: PRIVATISATION OF BENEFITS AND SOCIALISATION OF RISKS <br />
<br />
The Nepad action plan is based on a resource-led development approach which prioritises the extractive industry sector, paving the way for criss-crossing oil and gas transmission pipelines.  The capital intensive nature of these projects is beyond the purse of African states; and the action plan intends to facilitate the establishment of policies and institutional framework favourable for multinational corporations to invest.  This could include favourable contractual risk guarantees that profits are placed ahead of public concerns and generous tax exoneration provisions.  But the fact is that oil mining does not equate with the prosperity the international financial institutions give it credit for.  Even though Nigeria ranks seventh in terms of world oil production, she tailed the human development report in 2002.  Another point that cannot escape attention, particularly in the context of the present US-led war against terrorism, is the potential millitarisation of pipeline routes and the inevitable impact on the human rights of nearby communities.  Envisaged power projects will significantly impact on the livelihood development of communities.  For example, the Mepanda Uncua Hydropower Project will lead to the construction of a 100 square kilometre reservoir that is going to displace 1400 people, while floods are expected to impact on further thousands.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#039;t like to conclude without resuscitating the focus of this article: Is Nepad worth its value in sustainable development?  Calibrated on the aforementioned points, it is hard to answer in the affirmative.  In addition, credence for this pessimism roots in Nepad&#039;s engagement with civil society organisations in Africa, international social labour, and environmental movements.  In obviating the contributions of these actors, who in their struggle for socio-environmental and economic justice have been able to bring about a modicum of progressive global change, Nepad fails to differ from other multinational corporations&#039; designs to mine Africa&#039;s resources and maim its people.  Is this the price to be paid in order for Africa to claim this millennium?<br />

<p> SAPS: A National Malady<br />
<br />
                            Karim F. Hirji<br />
                            April 19, 2003<br />
<br />
Air travelers are perhaps unduly worried about SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The world at large, however, stands petrified at the virulence of SAPS, the supremely arrogant patriotic syndrome. The climax of the recent upsurge of its U.S.  genetic variant was too shocking and awful.<br />
<br />
The two syndromes have distinct pathogenic features. SARS affects the lungs. SAPS invades the brain tissue, perturbs neurotransmitter levels, and disrupts neural link s. Relatively few have contracted SARS thus far. SAPS has engulfed virtually a whole nation. SARS can be rapidly lethal. Curiously, SAPS threatens the well being and lives of unfortunate outsiders who come under the intense gaze of the infected nation. The mode of transmission of SARS has not been precisely delineated. SAPS, however, is known to spread electronically, principally through the television screen. The education system and other social institutions also play a role in its propagation.<br />
<br />
       A person harboring the SAPS virus manifests a host of psychological abnormalities. Perception of reality is distorted; for example, war appears like a basketball game in which one waves the flag and cheers on the home team. Curious rules of reasoning take hold. Preparing for war is accepted as adept diplomacy; the usage of forgeries, innuendoes and rank deception, a sign of statesmanship; repeated allegations about weapons of destruction and terror links, an incontrovertible proof of their existence; and wanton destruction of a society, a distinctive form of liberation. A schizophrenic morality grips the conscience; tears are shed for some lives but a blithe indifference prevails at the greater suffering and death among the outsiders. One contributes a few dollars to ameliorate the humanitarian tragedy. But then one studiously avoids asking whose actions led to the disruption of electricity, water, and food distribution, looting of hospitals, and the obliteration of a priceless part of the cultural heritage of humanity. If posed, such questions rapidly evaporate, since the ability and inclination to think critically are significantly curtailed by SAPS.<br />
<br />
And while prophylaxis against and therapy for SARS are under development, SAPS can be controlled by vaccination. The vaccine can be safely manufactured at home, and has antigenic components that promote moral decency, consistent application of rules of logic, resp ect for truth and evidence, the primacy of one&#039;s membership in the human family and an absolutely unapologetic love for all life. Unlike many other bio--vaccines, the protection afforded by the anti--SAPS vaccine is magnified over time if one lives a life consistent with its components. It does have side effects, though. It may invite unfriendly stares, verbal or physical abuse from strangers and unpleasant attention from the authorities. To date, relatively few have volunteered to take the vaccine.<br />
<br />
The U.S. variant of SAPS deserves special attention due to its enhanced toxicity and power to cause widespread mayhem. It is not a recent affliction; its existence was confirmed during World War II by psychiatrists when they observed how easily the American people accepted the wonderful claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were military targets. Since then the causative agent has mutated further, gained a firmer and broader foothold and acquired resistance to known antidotes. Over th e past fifty years, it has been continuously present at the surface, at times in a dormant form, and now and then flaring up with disastrous consequences for the people of Africa, Asia, and South and Central America. The prevalence rate was high in the 1990s. Among the symptoms were the readiness with which the American public cheered or was indifferent towards Bill Clinton&#039;s war on Iraq, the impact of economic sanctions, and his decimation of the medicinal factory in Sudan. He was openly branded by many as an immoral liar for his sexual misdeeds and deceptions. Yet, his popularity and credibility surged whenever he attacked those pesky outsiders. Indicative of the moral muddle induced by SAPS, his patently hollow reasons were rarely questioned by most of those who have now come to oppose Mr. Bush&#039;s invasion of Iraq.<br />
<br />
An article in the Journal of Calamitous Contagions has demonstrated  statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) positive correlations between reduction of pub lic health expenditures and increase of military funding on the one hand and infectivity, resilience and virulence of the SAPS virus, on the other. Higher unemployment and deterioration of social benefits tend to drive people from disadvantaged groups to the institutions that epitomize the violent ethic of SAPS. This study indicated possible existence of an emotion tranferrence effect as well. That is, are those brutalized by a system transferring their frustrations on more harshly brutalized victims abroad? This hypothesis needs further study. The moral bankruptcy of serving the instruments of massive violence and then turning around to demand respect and reparations is, however, undeniable.<br />
<br />
The triumphalist jubilations on the heels of the victory in Iraq symbolize a disturbing mutative enhancement of the pathogenicity of the U.S. SAPS virus. As soon as the guns started blazing, a big majority fell in line. But there was one positive outcome; a  a small, significant , dedicated and growing minority showed signs of antibodies able to resist SAPS. They spoke out, marched and engaged in civil disobedience. Some had been previously inoculated while others had acquired immunity through social activism. However, these circulating antibodies provided limited protection against SAPS. Consequently, the peace activists adopted the language of charity and not that of justice and accountability. They competed to `support the troops.&#039;  Would they say, for example, that they opposed the death penalty but supported the executioners? It would sound absurd, but that was the kind of logic they reserved for the outsiders. Their declarations of moral outrage were distinctly muted. The efficacy of the current vaccine needs to be improved. Unless that is done, and the mechanisms of social acquisition of immunity creatively reinforced, the virus will continue to ensure that a genuine vision of global citizenship is a foreign concept to most Americans.<br />
<br />
Overall, this latest cruise missile driven spasm of SAPS has made otherwise decent people firmly and finally accept the principle that the end justifies the means, that violence is the preferred and effective way to resolve conflicts, and that might does make right. The leader is now the Great, Respected and Beloved Leader who will defend the nation besieged and terrified by color coded alerts against its enemies. The list of enemies grows by the day; new targets added and given a tacit nod by a mostly indifferent populace. Typical bickering continues on the domestic front. But against the outsiders, the new rules of engagement are firmly ensconced.<br />
<br />
Recent laboratory tests have pointed to a distinctively novel mutant form, abbreviated SAPS II. Virologists are divided whether to call it the Singularly Assertive Patriotic Syndrome, or more especially, the Special Atomic Preemption Strategy virus. Also it is unclear if it emerged from a governmental bio--weapons laboratory. But the main question is what it behooves for humanity: Will SAPS II incline the American people to go along with nuclear preemption as a viable strategy for international affairs? Or will the tenacious few among them who have developed a degree of immunity to SAPS succeed in inoculating or otherwise protecting their fellow citizens and enable them to control paranoia, temper jingoism, renounce violence and terrorism, reduce the greed for oil and other resources, and accept the fundamental humanity of the outsiders? Such are the grave questions people across the planet are posing at the moment.<br />

<p>African woman&#039;s report on Bush visit<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dearest friends, <br />
<br />
As you probably know, this week George Bush is visiting Africa. Starting with Senegal, he arrived this morning at 7.20 PM and left at 1.30 PM.  Let me share with you what we have been through since last week: More than 1,500 persons have been arrested and put in jail between Thursday and Monday.  Hopefully they will be released now that the Big Man is gone; The US Army&#039;s planes flying day and night over Dakar; The noise they make is so loud that one hardly sleeps at night; About 700 security people from the US for Bush&#039;s security in Senegal, with their dogs, and their cars.  Senegalese security forces were not allowed to come near the US president; All trees in places where Bush will pass have been cut.  Some of them have been there for more than 100 years; All roads going down town (were hospitals, businesses, schools are located) were closed from Monday night to Tuesday at 3 PM.  This means that we could not go to our offices or schools.  Sick people were also obliged to stay at home;  National exams for high schools that started on Monday are postponed until Wednesday.<br />
<br />
Bush&#039;s visit to the Goree Island is another story.  As you may know Goree is a small island facing Dakar where from the 15th to the 19th century, the African slaves to be shipped to America were parked in special houses called slave houses.  One of these houses has become a Museum to remind humanity about this dark period and has been visited by kings, queens and presidents.  Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, and before them, Nelson Mandela, the Pope, and many other distinguished guests or ordinary tourists visited it without bothering the islanders.  But for &quot;security reasons&quot; this time, the local population was chased out of their houses from 5 to 12 AM.  They were forced by American security to leave their houses and leave everything open, including their wardrobes, to be searched by special dogs brought from the US. The ferry that links the island to Dakar was stopped and offices and businesses closed for the day.<br />
<br />
According to an economist who was interviewed by a private radio, Senegal is a very poor country that has lost huge amounts of money in this visit, because workers have been prevented from walking out of their homes.<br />
<br />
In addition to us being prevented from going out, other humiliating things happened also. Bush brought his own arm-<br />
chairs, and of course his own cars, and meals and drinks.  He came with his own journalists and ours were forbidden inside the airport and in places he was visiting.<br />
<br />
Our president was not allowed to make a speech.  Only Bush spoke when he was in Goree.  He spoke about slavery.  It seems that he needs the vote of the African American to be elected in the next elections, and wanted to please them.  That&#039;s why he visited Goree.<br />
<br />
Several protest marches against American politics have been organized yesterday and even when Bush was here, but we think he does not care.<br />
<br />
We have the feeling that everything has been done to convince us that we are nothing, and that America can behave the way it wants, everywhere, even in our country.<br />
<br />
Believe me friends, it is a terrible feeling.  But according to a Ugandan friend of mine, I should not complain because in Uganda Bush does not intend to go out of the airport.  He will receive the Ugandan President in the airport lounge.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I think I am lucky, because I have such wonderful American friends.  But there are now thousands of Senegalese who believe that for all Americans the world is their territory.<br />
<br />
Love to you all Codou <br />

I include myself as an endorser of such a detailed and well-assessed letter which touches on a lot of the subjects that affect the work, aspirations and hearts of many Africans longing for continental prosperity. However, I was disappointed that the writers ignored African-Americans, who are a strategic and powerful constituency for Africa in the United States. As continental Africans, we share ancestral, historical, societal and economic sameness with African-Americans even though we may live on two different continents. African activists and civil society - especially those engaged in changing US/Africa relations - have an obligation to involve and tap the powerful voices of African-Americans.</div>

<p>People who witness acts of terror and violence are often called after the event to bear witness to what they saw. In cases where this violence is inflicted by the state upon its own people, the process of bearing witness is both politically complex and traumatic for the individual involved. Fiona Ross&#039;s fascinating study of the process of bearing witness is the first book to examine the gendered dimensions of this topic from an anthropological and ethnographic viewpoint. Taking as a key example the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, Ross explores women&#039;s relationships to testimony, particularly the extent to which women avoid talking about or are silent about certain forms of violence and suffering. </p><br class='clearme' /></div><div><h3>JOURNAL OF PEACE BUILDING AND DEVELOPMENT</h3><h4>CALL FOR PAPERS: VOLUME I NUMBER 2 &#x2013; Peace building And Development Challenges And Opportunities In Africa</h4><h4>2003-07-17</h4><h4><a href="http://pambazuka.org/en/category/books/16348">http://pambazuka.org/en/category/books/16348</a></h4>

<p>This study of Nkrumah provides a compelling account of one of the most significant politicians in post-colonial Africa.  Hadjor argues that although Nkrumah&#039;s experiment failed, it continues to have relevance for Africa today.  He also illustrates how certain mistakes were unavoidable during Nkrumah&#039;s time.  He writes of the clarity of Nkrumah&#039;s vision, which helps throw light on the problems many Africans face today.  In this important way, Hadjor&#039;s reworking of the essential themes of Nkrumah&#039;s presidency contributes to the debate on the political future of Africa and promises to give focus to the recent revival of interest in Nkrumah.</p><br class='clearme' /></div><div><h3>South Africa / Dutch Contemporary Dance Collaboration</h3><h4>2003-07-17</h4><h4><a href="http://www.africapulse.org.za/index.php?action=viewarticle&amp;articleid=1335">http://www.africapulse.org.za/index.php?action=viewarticle&amp;articleid=1335</a></h4>

This means that our poetry, just like our music and dance, contributed a great deal to South Africa&#x2019;s present dispensation. Another reason is that new South African poetry is hardly ever studied in schools and universities; and that our public libraries do not carry sufficient poetry resources.

In that year, AAH published The Geopolitics of Hunger, 2000-2001: Hunger and Power, an edited volume that presents an overview of contemporary food security issues. Indeed, the argument made by AAH is more complicated than supply and demand: control of food supplies is a tool wielded by authorities in power and those seeking to contest that power. Famine is more often a result of human action than environmental drought or disaster. The Geopolitics of Hunger describes the places and ways in which chronic malnutrition and the threat of starvation result from political manipulation of food supplies, despite international legal prohibitions against the use of food as weapon of war.   </p><br class='clearme' /></div><br /><br /><hr/>

UN RIGHTS OFFICIAL WELCOMES NEW PROVISIONS TO STRENGTHEN WOMEN&#039;S RIGHTS IN <br />
AFRICA<br />
New York, Jul 14 2003  4:00PM<br />
<br />
The Acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights today welcomed <br />
the decision taken at the recently concluded African Union Summit in <br />
Mozambique to strengthen women&#039;s rights by adding gender specific <br />
provisions to an existing charter.<br />
<br />
&quot;The adoption by the African Union of a specific treaty on the rights of <br />
women reinforces the message that women&#039;s rights require priority attention <br />
in the protection of universal and inalienable rights,&quot; Bertrand Ramcharan <br />
said in a statement from Geneva.<br />
<br />
The adoption Saturday of the new protocol to the African Charter on Human <br />
and Peoples Rights reflects the growing commitment to address the <br />
widespread discrimination and rights violations suffered by women, Mr. <br />
Ramcharan said, speaking upon his return from the Summit of African leaders <br />
held last week. It recognizes the key role women play in sustainable <br />
development and conflict prevention, he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;The women of Africa have demonstrated their strength and resilience; they <br />
deserve and are entitled to full recognition as equal partners - both in <br />
private and family life and in their participation in economic, social and <br />
political activities,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Mr. Ramcharan urged the early ratification of the Protocol to the African <br />
Charter on Human and Peoples&#039; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, so <br />
it could enter into force as speedily as possible.<br />

<p>Both the government of Liberia and Liberian rebel forces are responsible for violations of international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes and other serious human rights abuses, according to a briefing before the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus. &quot;Tens of thousands of Liberians have been forcibly displaced and hundreds if not thousands of civilians have been killed, either deliberately or in crossfire.

Testimony of Janet Fleischman <br />
Washington Director for Africa of Human Rights Watch <br />
On the Human Rights Situation in Liberia <br />
Before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus <br />
July 9, 2003<br />
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding these important hearings and for inviting me to testify.  My name is Janet Fleischman, and I am the Washington Director for Africa of Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch has monitored the human rights situation in Liberia and in the West African sub region for more than a decade, through regular missions as well as a field presence for over three years in Sierra Leone. We recently completed a field investigation in Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire and neighboring countries. Based on our information, we would like to offer the following analysis of the human rights situation in Liberia and recommendations for U.S. policy. <br />
<br />
President Bush&#x2019;s current trip to Africa provides an important moment to assess the challenges and opportunities for U.S. policy in Liberia and in the West African sub-region. Developments in the past year in Liberia and Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire highlight the serious potential for a constant regional cycle of conflict and destabilization as armed groups produce new cycles of human rights abuses, internally displaced persons and refugees, and child soldiers.  Protection of civilians and accountability for abuses are two key issues in the region, both of which must be addressed through political and financial efforts. <br />
<br />
While the Special Court for Sierra Leone represents an important attempt to end the cycle of violence and impunity by holding accountable those who bear the greatest responsibility for gross abuses of human rights, more efforts are needed to investigate and document the ways in which human rights abuses continue to fuel conflicts throughout the region, and to hold perpetrators accountable.  In particular, the indictment of President Charles Taylor by the Special Court for Sierra Leone should be built upon to ensure accountability for all those responsible for war crimes and other serious violations of human rights in Liberia. <br />
  <br />
The United States has a critical role to play in consistently condemning all perpetrators of human rights abuses, whether they are state or non-state actors; limiting their ability to carry out abuses by cutting off supplies of weapons and financing; and supporting effective mechanisms to increase the accountability of regional and local authorities to their populations. <br />
<br />
The Human Rights Situation in Liberia <br />
<br />
Over the past few months, Liberia has returned to full-scale armed conflict. The main rebel group, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), operates from bases in Lofa county in Liberia and from Guinea, where it has that government&#x2019;s support.  A second rebel group called the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), which has recently split from the LURD and is reportedly receiving support from the Ivorian government, has also made territorial gains and captured Greenville in late April.  Many of the members of these rebel groups were part of other warring factions in Liberia&#x2019;s first brutal war. With the support of neighboring governments, they have now re-grouped and re-armed, and have initiated a new phase of war in Liberia. <br />
<br />
Both the government of Liberia and Liberian rebel forces are responsible for violations of international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes and other serious human rights abuses. Tens of thousands of Liberians have been forcibly displaced and hundreds if not thousands of civilians have been killed, either deliberately or in crossfire. Recent human rights abuses committed by both sides include the forced recruitment of children in displaced and refugee camps, forced labor, assault, and sexual violence against civilians, as well as attacks on humanitarian workers. The inflow of arms in breach of the U.N. embargo (see below) contributes to such abuses.  The Liberian government has continued its intolerance of dissent, and civil society actors &#x2013; especially human rights activists and independent journalists -- face harassment, intimidation, and imprisonment. <br />
<br />
Fighting between the Liberian government and rebel groups spread to all three neighboring borders in 2003.  As of March 2003, incidents at Bo Waterside, on the Sierra Leonean border, Ganta on the Guinean border, and Toe town and Zwedru, near the Ivorian border, reflected the increasing regional involvement in the Liberian war, with attacks taking place both along and across borders. Due to the fighting and the lack of security guarantees for aid workers, parts of the country have been inaccessible to humanitarian agencies since the resurgence of fighting in March 2003. Many civilians are in territory under the control of Liberian rebel groups, the LURD and MODEL. <br />
<br />
The peace talks being held in Ghana produced a ceasefire agreement on June 17, 2003. The ceasefire has been broken by several serious bouts of fighting between the Liberian government and rebel forces in and around Monrovia. The recent conflict has displaced thousands of civilians and exacerbated the already dire humanitarian situation in the country. In late June, troops from the LURD entered and then retreated to the outskirts of Monrovia, prompting mass displacement and reports of numerous deaths of civilians in and around the town. According to credible sources in Monrovia, several hundred civilians have died in the capital in the past few weeks from the fighting, from reprisal killings, and from the increasing toll taken by disease. <br />
<br />
  <br />
The U.S. is currently considering sending troops to Liberia, and a team of military experts arrived in Monrovia on Monday to assess the humanitarian and security situation.  Human Rights Watch believes that the deployment of a peacekeeping force with U.N. authorization to protect civilians would make an important contribution to stabilizing the situation in Liberia and that the U.S. has an important role to play in such a force, given its historical links to the country. We consider it of utmost importance that any military action be undertaken with full respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. The force should have a robust mandate to ensure the maintenance of law and order, to protect civilians, and help ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach civilian populations in need. <br />
<br />
The indictment of Charles Taylor <br />
<br />
Elected president of Liberia in 1997 after a seven-year war ousted former president Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor gained international notoriety for the brutal abuses of civilians perpetrated by his forces in Liberia, and for his use of child soldiers organized in &#x201C;Small Boy Units.&#x201D; Taylor&#x2019;s support for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone contributed to the deaths, rape and mutilations of thousands of civilians, and led to United Nations sanctions on his regime. Taylor&#x2019;s forces have also been implicated in conflicts in neighboring Guinea and Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire. <br />
<br />
On June 4, the Special Court for Sierra Leone &#x201C;unsealed&#x201D; its indictment against Charles Taylor as one of those &#x201C;bearing the greatest responsibility&#x201D; for war crimes (including murder and taking hostages); crimes against humanity (rape, murder, extermination, sexual slavery); and other serious violations of international humanitarian law (use of child soldiers) committed in Sierra Leone. The indictment charges that Taylor actively supported the RUF in Sierra Leone&#x2019;s ten-year civil war, providing training and helping finance the RUF, in preparation for RUF armed action in Sierra Leone and during the subsequent armed conflict in Sierra Leone. It also alleges that Taylor acted in concert with members of the RUF/Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) rebel alliance who are accused of horrific crimes. <br />
<br />
The Special Court was established by agreement between the United Nations and Sierra Leone and is designed to function for three years. The Special Court has power to prosecute those &#x201C;who bear the greatest responsibility&#x201D; for serious violations of international humanitarian law and certain violations of Sierra Leone law committed in Sierra Leone since November 30, 1996.  The Special Court&#x2019;s Statute and implementing legislation specifically provide that official capacity is no defense to arrest or prosecution, i.e., there is no immunity for a head of state. The statutes for the Rwanda and Yugoslav Tribunals and the International Criminal Court similarly bar immunity based on official position, reflecting the increasing trend by international courts to bring officials to justice for war crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of international humanitarian law, even while they are still in office. <br />
<br />
The future of President Charles Taylor is uncertain. After initially stating that he would step down in favor of a transitional government, he has recently wavered on that point, and now says that he will not leave until U.S. peacekeeping troops have arrived.  His past record of broken agreements and commitments give little grounds for hope that he will fulfill the most recent accords, or that providing him immunity would bring stability. <br />
<br />
President Bush has explicitly called for Taylor to step down.  Meanwhile, President John Kufuor of Ghana has urged that Taylor be given immunity from prosecution in exchange for leaving office, and President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria has offered him a &#x201C;safe haven&#x201D; in Nigeria. <br />
<br />
Suggestions of withdrawing the indictment or providing immunity from prosecution to Charles Taylor should be rejected in light of the lessons learned in the region. In 1999, the Lomé peace accord in Sierra Leone purportedly granted an amnesty for crimes committed by all combatants during the civil war on the basis that this was necessary to achieve peace. But once granted amnesty, the rebels resumed military operations, plunging Sierra Leone into two more years of war. The Special Court for Sierra Leone, which has a mandate to bring those who bear the greatest responsibilities for atrocities to justice, is one of the key mechanisms that are now contributing to the restoration of peace in that country. <br />
<br />
The United States should support Charles Taylor&#x2019;s indictment and state clearly that no safe haven should be provided to Taylor, and that every government should implement the international arrest warrant of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and hand him over to the Court for prosecution. If U.S. troops are sent to Liberia, they should not make any deals that involve a withdrawal of the indictment of President Taylor by the Special Court for Sierra Leone or any explicit or implicit understanding that a government will not implement the Court&#x2019;s warrant. At the same time, the U.S. should support plans for strengthening the ceasefire, stabilizing the country, and commit U.S. resources to rebuild post-war Liberia. <br />
<br />
Guinea <br />
<br />
Efforts to resolve the Liberian crisis cannot succeed without addressing Liberia&#x2019;s neighbors, who have both suffered from and contributed to the cycle of conflict. Guinea is both the principal regional recipient of large numbers of refugees and a key supporter of the Liberian rebel group, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD).  While Guinea is clearly in a fragile positionholding elections later this year, with an unstable economy, and with over 100,000 Sierra Leonean, Ivorian and Liberian refugees remaining on its territory the government has an obligation to respect international human rights and humanitarian norms, and to respect the U.N. arms embargo on Liberia. <br />
<br />
The U.S. has an important role to play vis-à-vis Guinea&#x2019;s support for the LURD, because of a recent U.S. army training program for the Guinean military.  A battalion of 800 soldiers was trained over a six month period, from May 2002. The training, which had a budget of U.S.$3 million, included a mid-term review, but there were no plans to set up mechanisms to monitor the conduct of the troops or their respect for human rights after their deployment. <br />
<br />
The U.S. has called on &#x201C;all parties in the region to cease supporting any group that seeks political change through violence and to respect their neighbor&#x2019;s borders.&#x201D;  But although the U.S. has expressed concern about the human rights situation in Guinea and states that it has also privately raised issues of refugee protection with the Guinean government, Human Rights Watch is not aware that the U.S. has made any public statements expressing concern about Guinea&#x2019;s role in supporting the LURD or in colluding with human rights abuses against Liberian refugees. <br />
<br />
Guinea should be warned by the United States to cease its support to LURD or face the possibility of sanctions. In addition, it is essential that refugees are able to seek refuge in Guinea and that refugee camps retain a truly humanitarian character. <br />
<br />
Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire <br />
<br />
The past eight months of armed conflict in Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire and, in particular, the patterns of human rights abuses in the western part of the country, are a renewed reminder of the need to address the underlying causes of an ever-shifting regional crisis. The eight-month-old war in the Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire has revealed deep divisions in Ivorian society and produced numerous serious abuses against civilians, some of which amount to war crimes. Western Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire has been the site of a virtual proxy war by Liberian forces, demonstrating the easy spillover potential of the Liberian conflict. The recent ceasefire in the west, and the formation of the government of reconciliation, are steps in the right direction, but the Ivorian peace process remains extremely fragile. There is an urgent need to reinforce these positive steps with further concrete action, both within Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire and in neighboring Liberia. Impunityboth past and present, Ivorian and regionalremains a key concern that must be addressed if a stable Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire is to emerge from the past months of conflict. <br />
<br />
Circulation of arms <br />
<br />
The inflow and circulation of arms, particularly small arms and light weapons, in the region has clearly contributed to the increased conflict and abuses against civilians by governments and armed groups. It also has facilitated the formation of new armed groups and the use of ill disciplined fighters and unaccountable mercenaries. <br />
<br />
The recent report of the U.N. Panel of Experts on Liberia documented continuing violations of the arms embargo on Liberia and noted that the support of regional governments such as Guinea to Liberian insurgent groups constitutes a violation of the sanctions regime. The Liberian government recently acknowledged importing huge quantities of small arms and light weapons, and the list of imported weapons it provided the Panel closely match those documented to have been illegally delivered from Serbia and Montenegro in six shipments in 2002; the Liberian government did not admit to earlier illicit arms purchases, which have also been documented. The Panel also described numerous suspected actual or attempted arms shipments to Liberia in recent months, including a possible ongoing scheme to export weapons to Liberia on the basis of a Democratic Republic of Congo end-user certificate. <br />
<br />
In addition, abusive insurgents throughout West Africa have been able to obtain arms and other military support with apparent ease. The Panel describes Guinea as a supply route for arms to the LURD, as noted, and points out that it has some evidence Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire is supporting an armed Liberian militia and MODEL. The use of unaccountable mercenaries and untrained civilian militias, including in Côte d&#x2019;Ivoire, is also troubling, particularly as many of those recruited, including ex-RUF, are known to have an atrocious human rights record. Human Rights Watch urges the United States to consistently condemn all regional governments that violate the sanctions regime on Liberia and/or support abusive forces. The U.S. should also monitor arms flows using its own technology and presence in the region, and report on its observations to the U.N. Panel. <br />
<br />
Recommendations <br />
<br />
Human Rights Watch urges the United States to: <br />
<br />
· Call on all parties in Liberia to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, particularly regarding treatment of civilians and other non-combatants, and recruitment of child soldiers, and to hold those members of their forces responsible for abuses accountable. <br />
<br />
· Call on all parties in the Liberian conflict to respect humanitarian aid workers and guarantee their security and access to civilian populations in need of assistance and protection. <br />
<br />
· Actively explore and support mechanisms to ensure accountability for abuses committed by all parties to the conflict. <br />
<br />
· Support the establishment of a peacekeeping force in Liberia and ensure that any military action be undertaken with full respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. The force should have U.N. authorization to ensure the maintenance of law and order, to protect civilians, and help ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach civilian populations in need. <br />
<br />
· In the event that U.S. troops are sent to Liberia, ensure that the U.S. does not make any deals that involve a withdrawal of the indictment of President Charles Taylor or any explicit or implicit understanding that a government will not implement the Special Court for Sierra Leone&#x2019;s arrest warrant. <br />
<br />
· Call on all states to support the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and to hand over any additional individuals indicted by the Special Court of Sierra Leone who flee into their territories, to assist in their apprehension, and to otherwise cooperate with the Special Court. <br />
<br />
· Condemn regional governments for their support to abusive insurgent groups and violations of existing sanctions on Liberia, and consider imposing secondary sanctions on regional governments found to be involved in the Liberian war. <br />

Nigeria: Police use of lethal force against demonstrators must be<br />
investigated<br />
<br />
<br />
Amnesty International is urging Nigerian authorities to launch an<br />
independent public inquiry into the death of at least four people reported<br />
to have been killed in Lagos in clashes involving the police and civilians<br />
during demonstrations against an increase in the price of fuel. More than<br />
seven days after the people were announced dead, no investigation has been<br />
carried out.<br />
<br />
A 27 year-old man, Obot Akpan Etim was among the people shot dead in what<br />
appeared to be a peaceful protest. In statements made on 7 July 2003, the<br />
police commissioner and the public relations officer of Lagos denied any<br />
wrongdoing by the police. They rather accused other demonstrators of<br />
fomenting the killing.<br />
<br />
A 25-year-old woman who witnessed the police brutality told Amnesty<br />
International how, on her way to work on that Monday 7 morning, in Oshodi,<br />
a suburb of Lagos, she got caught up in the events which took place that<br />
day. &quot;I could see hundreds of people who were peacefully protesting in the<br />
street. They were chanting and shouting slogans. Suddenly and without<br />
warning, the police charged at us, throwing teargas in our direction. In<br />
the confusion, people were running in all directions; some were falling<br />
down. I lost consciousness for a while. When I woke up, I noticed that the<br />
explosions had affected my voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a report published in December 2002 (view the full report online at<br />
<a href="http://amnesty-news.c.tclk.net/maabfZnaaZcJFbb0iygb/">http://amnesty-news.c.tclk.net/maabfZnaaZcJFbb0iygb/</a> ), Amnesty<br />
International expressed its concerns about the police brutality in the<br />
three years following the return to civilian rule in Nigeria. The police<br />
attempts to curb crime has been marred by the deaths of hundreds of<br />
people. Police violence sometimes appears to have been unleashed amid<br />
government complacency.<br />
<br />
&quot;The government should ensure that law enforcement officers do not exert<br />
any excessive use of lethal force in peaceful demonstrations,&quot; Amnesty<br />
International said.<br />
<br />
Wherever a person sustains injuries or dies as a result of public unrest,<br />
especially when police or security forces are involved, there should be an<br />
immediate investigation.<br />
<br />
&quot;People should not be shot at for protesting peacefully and all those<br />
found responsible for such violations must be investigated and brought to<br />
justice according to international standards of fair trial,&quot; the<br />
organization said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Background<br />
<br />
A wave of protests led by the National Labour Congress (NLC) swept through<br />
many Nigerian towns, including Abuja and Lagos, following the government&#039;s<br />
decision in June 2003 to dramatically increase the price of fuel. The<br />
strikes which took place from 30 June to 9 July resulted in an excessive<br />
use of force by the police. They reportedly used live ammunition and tear<br />
gas against peaceful demonstrators in their attempt to end the strikes.<br />

Uganda: Sharp Decline in Human Rights <br />
<br />
(Kampala, July 15, 2003)  Abductions, torture, recruitment of child soldiers, and other abuses have sharply increased in the past year in northern Uganda due to renewed fighting between Ugandan government forces and rebels, a coalition of national and international organizations said in a report released today. <br />
<br />
The 73-page report, &#x201C;Abducted and Abused: Renewed War in Northern Uganda,&#x201D; details how a slew of human rights abuses have resulted in a humanitarian crisis. Since June 2002, the rebel Lord&#x2019;s Resistance Army (LRA) has abducted nearly 8,400 children and thousands more adults, a sharp rise from 2001. The LRA has also escalated the seventeen-year war against northern Uganda&#x2019;s civilians by targeting religious leaders, aid providers, and those living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. <br />
<br />
&#x201C;Child abduction, murder, and mutilation are the signatures of the LRA in this war,&#x201D; said Lloyd Axworthy, former Canadian minister for external affairs. &#x201C;This is a war that has been fought primarily against the children and people of northern Uganda.&#x201D; Axworthy is CEO and executive director of the Liu Institute for Global Issues in Vancouver, which issued the report together with the Peace and Human Rights Center in Kampala, Human Rights Focus in Gulu, and Human Rights Watch in New York, of which Axworthy is a board member. <br />
<br />
The seventeen-year conflict between the LRA and the Ugandan government intensified in March 2002, when the government army, the Ugandan People&#x2019;s Defence Forces (UPDF), launched a military offensive, &#x201C;Operation Iron Fist,&#x201D; against LRA bases in southern Sudan. The offensive failed to accomplish its aim of destroying the LRA, which evaded the UPDF and in June 2002 returned to northern Uganda. The renewed conflict is taking its highest toll ever: <br />
<br />
· Since June 2002, the LRA abducted 8,400 children, the highest rate of abductions ever in seventeen years of war. <br />
· Fear of LRA abduction has driven approximately 20,000 children to escape nightly into Gulu and other towns. These children sleep on verandas, on church grounds and at local hospitals, returning home each morning, becoming locally known as &#x201C;night commuters.&#x201D; <br />
· An estimated 800,000 northern Ugandans are internally displaced due to LRA attacks and government orders-approximately 70 percent of the entire population of the three war-affected districts in northern Uganda. <br />
· Respective Mortality Rate (for three months in 2003) for children under five in two IDP camps near Gulu was 5.67/1,000, where 4/1,000 is considered an emergency. This rate was the highest recorded in five years, yet it was not caused by any outbreak of disease, leading the agency conducting the survey to raise the possibility that the children had simply &#x201C;died of hunger.&#x201D; <br />
· Although overall HIV prevalence in Uganda has reportedly declined substantially in recent years, there is lingering high prevalence in the north: Gulu reportedly has the second highest rate of HIV prevalence after Kampala, attributed among other things to the higher rate of HIV among combatants. Among expectant mothers tested at one of two hospitals in Gulu, the rates of HIV prevalence were 11-12 percent, where 5 percent is the national rate. <br />
<br />
The report draws on interviews with recently abducted children who escaped from the LRA. It gives voice to internally displaced persons living in the IDP camps that have been attacked by the LRA, and the aid workers attempting to reach these victims despite frequent LRA ambushes on relief convoys. <br />
<br />
While the Ugandan government is obligated to intervene to stop these violations, its own forces have committed gross abuses, including torture, rape, underage recruitment, and arbitrary detention. The government has also increased the suffering of northern Uganda&#x2019;s population through the forced displacement of civilians into IDP camps, which have little or no protection. But UPDF soldiers and other government forces accused by civilians of serious crimes such as murder, torture, or rape often escape trial or sanction, creating the public perception of impunity. <br />
<br />
&#x201C;Not only has the Ugandan government failed to protect its citizens adequately,&#x201D; said Samuel B. Tindifa, director of the Human Rights and Peace Centre. &#x201C;They have also actively violated their rights, detained them for long periods without showing cause, and recruited children into the army and home guards.&#x201D; <br />
<br />
The UPDF in northern Uganda arrests civilians on suspicion of rebel collaboration with little or no evidence, often holding them for rough interrogation or torture before turning them over to the police for prosecution. The prosecutors then charge the suspects with treason or terrorism, which allows the government to hold them for up to 360 days without bail and without having to present any evidence. <br />
<br />
&#x201C;The United Nations and members of the international community need to take a more active role to end this desperate state of affairs in northern Uganda,&#x201D; said Jemera Rone, counsel for the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. &#x201C;The government and LRA peace talks have ended and the war is continuing at a heightened pace, with worse impact than ever on the entire population of Acholiland.&#x201D; <br />
<br />
The organizations urged the U.N. Secretary-General to appoint a special representative for northern Uganda to secure the release of abducted children by conducting &#x201C;shuttle diplomacy&#x201D; between the LRA and the Ugandan government. They also called upon the Sudanese government to end its support of the LRA and upon donor countries to monitor military assistance to Uganda to ensure that the government observes human rights standards. <br />
<br />
The four organizations called on the LRA to end its attacks on civilians, to stop abducting children and adults, and to release the abductees. The organizations also urged the government of Uganda to: <br />
· End impunity for human rights violations by government security and armed forces; <br />
· Review all cases of treason and terrorism suspects to ensure that sufficient evidence exists to justify detention; <br />
· Cease using treason or terrorism charges as a holding charge for those arbitrarily detained in areas in which rebels are active; <br />
· Take effective measures to protect civilians; and <br />
· Permit those living in internally displaced persons camps to move wherever they wish, except for extreme circumstances of insecurity. <br />

<p>The African Union&#039;s new ambassador for Southern Africa is none other than Robert Mugabe.  The AU summit held in Mozambique at the weekend provided an opportunity for Africa to show a commitment to its noble ideals.  But it ended on an anticlimax, some observed, with no discussion on the political situation in strife-torn Zimbabwe.  While some opposition politicians were &quot;galled&quot; by the election of Mugabe as one of the AU&#039;s five vice-chairpersons, others declared themselves &quot;content&quot;.</p><br class='clearme' /></div><div><h3>Zimbabwe: Moving towards a negotiated transition?</h3><h4>2003-07-17</h4><h4><a href="http://www.idasa.org.za/">http://www.idasa.org.za/</a></h4>
<p>Political and economic decay in Zimbabwe has become one of the major problems confronting post-apartheid Southern Africa and seriously threatens Africa&#039;s resolve to address democratic issues and re-invent its international image.  According to Africa&#039;s critics and many of its Northern supporters, the lack of assertive action towards Zimbabwe is indicative of the fact that NEPAD and the African Union will be unable to amount to anything more than rhetoric.  Despite humanitarian crises and overwhelming pressure for reform, Mr.  Mugabe remains in power and apparently continues to enjoy the support of influential regional players.  Increasing internal pressure and political dissent from pro-democracy forces have not compelled Mugabe&#039;s regime to concede that a crisis exists.  How has this regime, which shows increasingly little regard for democratic principles, human rights, rule of law and political pluralism managed to cling to power even when change appears inevitable?  asks this report from the Political Information &amp; Monitoring Service of Idasa.</p><br class='clearme' /></div><div><h3>zimbabwe: Tsvangirai must answer treason charges-prosecutors</h3><h4>2003-07-17</h4><h4><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L16645024.htm">http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L16645024.htm</a></h4>
<p>State prosecutors argued on Wednesday against calls for the treason case against Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to be dropped, saying he must answer charges he plotted to kill President Robert Mugabe.

In addition, safe learning environments can shield children and teens from exposure to landmines, recruitment into militias and gangs, and sexual violence. </p><br class='clearme' /></div><div><h3>africa: UNHCR launches special appeal for refugees in Africa</h3><h4>2003-07-17</h4><h4><a href="http://pambazuka.org/en/category/refugees/16333">http://pambazuka.org/en/category/refugees/16333</a></h4>
<p>The UN refugee agency has said it planned to launch a special appeal for funds to cover unforeseen needs in seven different African countries, none of which has received much international attention.<br />
GENEVA, July 11 (UNHCR) -The UN refugee agency said today it planned to <br />
launch a special appeal for funds to cover unforeseen needs in seven <br />
different African countries, none of which has received much international <br />
attention.<br />
<br />
UNHCR&#039;s &#039;All Africa Special Appeal&#039;, totaling just over US$ 14 million, is <br />
designed to address a number of new situations involving the displacement <br />
or relocation of more than 100,000 people. All these situations have <br />
developed since the beginning of the year and are therefore not covered by <br />
the agency&#039;s current annual budget for Africa.<br />
<br />
Almost half the required sum (US$ 6.7 million) is to provide emergency <br />
assistance to 41,000 refugees who have fled to Chad from the Central <br />
African Republic. The influx began in April, when fighting broke out <br />
between government and rebel forces in the north of the country. A recent <br />
joint assessment by UNHCR and the World Food Programme revealed that many <br />
of the refugees, who are located in extremely remote parts of southern <br />
Chad, are in dire need of aid. They need food, water and proper shelter, <br />
despite the provision of 5,000 tents by UNHCR and Médecins Sans Frontières <br />
(Belgium).<br />
<br />
The money will be used to set up organized camp structures, including <br />
health, sanitation and educational facilities in the two main areas where <br />
the refugees have settled, taking some of the burden off the local <br />
authorities and communities.<br />
<br />
In Kenya, an extra US$ 2.1 million is needed to pay for major repairs and <br />
reconstruction in the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps in the northeast of <br />
the country. Both camps were badly damaged by April&#039;s heavy rains and <br />
subsequent serious flooding, which completely destroyed around 1,000 <br />
refugee shelters and badly damaged a further 2,500 others. In addition, <br />
parts of a key access road to Dadaab were swept away, 200 latrines <br />
collapsed, some food stocks were lost and water supplies were contaminated.<br />
<br />
In addition to repairing the damaged infrastructure and providing emergency <br />
relief supplies, UNHCR plans to relocate 16,800 refugees living in the most <br />
floodprone area of the Kakuma camp to higher ground, before the next rains <br />
arrive in October. This will also mean setting up a new hospital and <br />
secondary school, since the existing ones were both badly damaged in the <br />
April floods and are unlikely to survive another flood, even a relatively <br />
minor one.<br />
<br />
In neighbouring Uganda, an extra US$ 850,000 is needed to cope with 9,000 <br />
new refugees who have fled recent interethnic fighting and atrocities in <br />
the Bunia region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The refugees <br />
have settled in the western Ugandan border areas around Lake Albert and the <br />
Semeliki River, and are currently sleeping out in the open or sheltering <br />
under local villagers&#039; verandas. In some villages, refugees outnumber local <br />
inhabitants, placing considerable strain on existing health, sanitation and <br />
educational facilities.<br />
<br />
UNHCR is requesting a further US$ 890,000 to relocate 15,000 Sudanese <br />
refugees who were forced to flee their camp in northern Uganda late last <br />
year by the repeated predations of the Lord&#039;s Resistance Army (LRA) rebels. <br />
Several refugees were killed and injured during the most severe attack on <br />
refugees by the LRA, in August 2002, and as a result the entire population <br />
of 24,000 refugees living in Acholpii camp fled southwards. Since then, the <br />
refugees have been living in very overcrowded conditions in the Kiryandongo <br />
settlement. Although 8,000 have already been relocated from Kiryandongo, <br />
overcrowding remains a serious problem, contributing to two cholera and <br />
three measles outbreaks. A third cholera outbreak is now affecting the <br />
settlement.<br />
<br />
The rest of the funds are needed for a variety of situations, including <br />
unexpected repatriations from the Central African Republic to the <br />
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and from Gabon to the Republic of <br />
the Congo (ROC). In Ethiopia, the UN refugee agency is planning to relocate <br />
around 5,300 Eritrean refugees from the disputed border between the two <br />
countries. And in Rwanda, UNHCR is trying to consolidate two existing camps <br />
into one.<br />
<br />
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, has introduced the appeal <br />
at the African Union Summit currently under way in the Mozambique capital, <br />
Maputo. The appeal will be formally presented to donors next week in Geneva.<br />
<br />
Prior to the new appeal, UNHCR&#039;s annual programme budget for Africa stood <br />
at just under US$ 330 million, with an additional US$ 65 million requested <br />
for four special programmes in Liberia, Côte D&#039;Ivoire Angola and Zambia. <br />
The latest appeal thus takes the overall total amount required by UNHCR for <br />
its protection and assistance programmes in Africa to more than US$ 400 <br />
million.<br />

Bush in Africa <br />
<br />
by Patrick Bond<br />
<br />
The petro-military-commerce safari that George Bush embarked upon this week may well succeed in the areas that progressive critics fear most. Those critics, ranged in protest in several African cities, are not shy about what&#039;s wrong with Washington&#039;s agenda.<br />
<br />
First, the imperial-subimperial nexus in South Africa and Nigeria will tighten. Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Olusegon Obasanjo are pro-western in terms of obeying the logic of multinational corporate privilege, and sufficiently undemocratic as to coddle dictators like Robert Mugabe. Mbeki and Obasanjo are the key boosters of the New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development (Nepad), that neoliberal manifesto considered by the Bush regime as &#039;philosophically spot-on&#039;, as chief Africa diplomat Walter Kansteiner told Institutional Investor magazine last month.<br />
<br />
Second, the possibility of increased US military activity on the continent will increase in some areas (bases in West Africa and the Horn of Africa to guard oil fields) and lesson in others (potential peace-keeping activities). South Africa will pick up the latter duty, even in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, both of which have seen recent &#039;peace&#039; agreements -- in reality, elite deals with no durable means of addressing long-standing local grievances -- followed immediately by intense fighting and bloodshed.<br />
<br />
Third, US trading corporations are increasingly profitable because of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and an even further-reaching free trade deal with pliant Southern African leaders is also making progress. This trend leaves less revenue for states like Namibia and Lesotho which used to count on larger import tariff funds, and leaves all of Africa more susceptible to Washington&#039;s arm-twisting. The Bush regime is already notorious for linkage of its geopolitical agenda with trade preferences and debt relief. Other AGOA conditionalities include adopting neoliberal policies, privatising state assets, removing subsidies and price controls, and ending incentives for local companies.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Bush needs the trip to project a more compassionate public image (especially to African-Americans in advance of the 2004 elections). That entails promoting the very slight rise in highly-conditional donations to Africa, as well as the miseleadingly advertised HIV/AIDS fund. The US piece of the AIDS fund will be run by a pharmaceutical corporate executive, and coincides with US government advisory support that makes import or local production of generic AIDS medicines much more difficult. That, of course, is the point of the new spending, which in any case is likely to be half or less than the $15 billion in coming years that Bush has bragged about.<br />
<br />
There are always a few complications, of course, and these were on display in Pretoria, where Bush spent 18 hours after his opening gambit at Senegal&#039;s slave-trading site on Tuesday. For example, South Africa did not join the &#039;coalition of the willing&#039; against Saddam Hussein, and Nelson Mandela remains a staunch opponent of Bush (hence no meeting?a symbolic slapdown of the US leader). <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Pretoria seems to have profited nicely from the hostilities by selling arms and also hyping somewhat ludicrous security concerns to play to the local anti-imperialist audience. Thus just before the war broke out, at a February 19 demonstration at the US embassy in Pretoria, African National Congress general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe pronounced, &#039;Because we are endowed with several rich minerals, if we don&#039;t stop this unilateral action against Iraq today, tomorrow they will come for us.&#039; Likewise, health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang was reported by the Guardian to have said, &#039;South Africa cannot afford drugs to fight HIV/AIDS partly because it needs submarines to deter attacks from nations such as the US.&#039; <br />
<br />
The high tech weaponry Tshabala-Msimang referred to will cost South Africa $5 billion, and make it possible to engage in fighting across the subcontinent. Meanwhile, Pretoria ignored widespread calls to withdraw permission for three Iraq-bound warships to dock and refuel in Durban harbor, and to halt sales of sophisticated armaments to the US/UK regimes. The state-owned arms manufacturer Denel often stated its vision of being &#039;an acknowledged global player.&#039; In the months before the war, it contracted to deliver $29 million in ammunition shell-casing, $169 million in artillery propellants, and 326 hand-held laser range finders to the British army. Denel also sold the US Marines 125 laser-guidance sights.<br />
<br />
If anti-war tensions were largely a &#039;talk-left, act-right&#039; dance of the sort we are so accustomed to, another tension -- over Bush&#039;s desired non-extradition treaty aimed at circumventing the International Criminal Court where US citizens are wanted -- at least gave Mbeki the chance to look principled. Losing roughly $7 million in military aid from Bush was not a terribly high cost, and kept alive the fiction that Pretoria can stand firm against Washington.<br />
<br />
It has often been remarked, including by Mbeki, that the most striking component of US international economic policy is hypocrisy. Treasury undersecretary John Taylor has explained the protection of steel and agriculture quite casually: &#039;You take steps forward and move back. That&#039;s always the case.&#039;<br />
<br />
Another example of the Washington&#039;s imposition of unsustainable development on Africa is the genetically-modified (GM) food controversy. The EU, Australia, Japan, China, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia have banned GM trade and production, so Bush is clearly desperate for new markets in Africa, as he revealed to the US Africa Business Summit shortly before his trip: &#039;To help Africa become more self sufficient in the production of food, I have proposed the initiative to end hunger in Africa. This initiative will help African countries to use new high yield bio tech crops and unleash the power of markets to dramatically increase agricultural productivity. But there&#039;s a problem. There&#039;s a problem. At present, some governments are blocking the import of crops grown with biotechnology, which discourages African countries from producing and exporting these crops. The ban of these countries is unfounded; it is unscientific; it is undermining the agricultural future of Africa. And I urge them to stop this ban.&#039;<br />
<br />
The Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference replied, &#039;We do not believe that agro companies or gene technologies will help our farmers to produce the food that is needed in the 21st century. On the contrary, we think it will destroy the diversity, the local knowledge and the sustainable agricultural systems that our farmers have developed for millennia and that it will thus undermine our capacity to feed ourselves.&#039; Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen&#039;s Global Trade Watch, interprets: &#039;The Bush administration is not straightforward. It is not poverty in Africa that is the most important issue for the administration but business considerations on behalf of the US technology and agricultural sector.&#039; <br />
<br />
As InterPress Service reports, &#039;Zambia, citing health concerns, rejected GM corn in both grain and milled forms. One year later, President Levy Mwanawasa announced last week that this year Zambia will nearly double the 600,000 tonnes of grain it harvested last season, providing new fuel to the argument that GM technology is not necessary for reducing hunger in Africa.&#039;<br />
<br />
Again, as in the case of resistance to local AIDS drugs, Bush&#039;s underlying concern is the penetration of capital into all areas of African life where it can make a profit. That requires the protection of patents as fundamental property rights, so as to protect profits in other parts of the world in circumstances where Africans are simply too poor to buy medicines or import non-GM food. <br />
<br />
These and many other insults to Africans have generated a healthy backlash. South Africa was one of the key sites of protest during the war and in recent days, notwithstanding the worsening divide between the major civil society groups and the independent left. The latter continues to mobilise as the Anti-War Coalition, and drew many thousands to marches in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban that called for Bush to leave Africa. The major trade unions, Communist Party, and ANC itself mustered numbers only in the hundreds, and issued a confusing message calling on Bush to listen to Mbeki, but not to cancel his visit. (Only in the Eastern Cape province has unity between the two groups been somewhat successful.)<br />
<br />
After Bush&#039;s talk with Mbeki on Wednesday, proponents of democracy in Zimbabwe were deeply embittered, for as opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai put it, the South African issued a &#039;false and mischievous&#039; statement that talks had already begun with Mugabe&#039;s regime. Hastily, South African and Zimbabwe government mediators sent a delegation to request Tsvangirai&#039;s Movement for Democratic Change to enter discussions. In any event, Bush made clear he would take the lead from Mbeki. Once again, it demonstrated to Zimbabwean progressives that &#039;none but ourselves&#039; will liberate the country. Whether imperial Washington or subimperial Pretoria attempts to mediate, the result will no doubt favor the worst features of the status quo.<br />
<br />
The same sentiment appears rife in Nigeria, where Obasanjo ran an extremely dirty election a few weeks ago, and where trade unions had a successful national strike against a gasoline price hike last week.<br />
<br />
But perhaps due merely to my proximity, the last word should go to the largest collection of anti-capitalist groups in South Africa: the Social Movements Indaba (SMI), which gathered at least 20,000 last August to protest the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. In their communique from the Maputo site of the African Union&#039;s second annual conference, chaired by Mozambican president Joachim Chissano beginning Thursday morning, the SMI announced that it:<br />
<br />
&#039;rejects the dominance of the United States and the other G8 countries and calls for the shutting down of their instruments of domination, including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organisation (WTO). The SMI also opposes those leaders and governments in Africa that are complicit in imposing this neoliberal global order... It is no small surprise that the G8 has refused to fill the begging bowl. It chooses only to support military intervention in the continent. George Bush is visiting Africa to secure oil resources, in other words to take what he wants whether Nepad is there or not. The African Union (AU) has been formed on the basis of Nepad as its fundamental policy. It thus compels us to stand up to the AU and demand that it jettisons Nepad before we give consideration to engaging with its structures.&#039;<br />
<br />
Not all African social movements are as tough, but the more they see of the Bush agenda, the greater the distance will grow between those perpetuating international minority rule (even Mbeki has used the phrase &#039;global apartheid&#039;) and its African victims. The leaders of African nations who chose to play the comprador role for Bush this week are not unaware of the US president&#039;s agenda, and they remain on notice that their legitimacy will also continue to suffer.<br />

<p>&quot;Even though some of NEPAD&#039;s stated goals may be well intentioned, the development vision and economic measures that it puts across for the realizations of these goals are either flawed in that they do not reflect the problems affecting Africans in general and workers in particular or makes heavy reliance on past discredited IMF, World Bank programmes.  As a result, NEPAD in its present form does not and will not contribute to making Africa a better place for the average worker.  It does not explicitly recognize the role of the worker in development; neither does it explicitly uphold the rights of the worker throughout its deliberations.  It relies on the assumption that NEPAD&#039;s benefit to the worker can only come through indirect &quot;trickle down&quot; effects.  This has not worked in the past (under IMF, World Bank programmes) and there is no reason to expect that it will work now.&quot;<br />

Context <br />
<br />
The ascendancy of neo-liberalism through globalisation triggered unprecedented interest within Civil Society in development models that African governments have adopted in their respective states and also others they have endorsed in regional and continental bodies. But the greatest challenge on the continental level has been around the New Economic Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development (NEPAD), a programme that was nurtured within the framework of the African Union, a pan African body whose vision is rooted in the 1960s anti colonial-struggles and quest for African Unity.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
NEPAD Outline<br />
<br />
Conceived and developed by a core group of African leaders, NEPAD describes itself as a &#039;comprehensive integrated development plan that addresses key social, economic and political priorities for the continent&#039;. The Final programme integrated the New African Initiative which was a merger of the Millennium recovery Plan (MAP) and the OMEGA plan for Africa&#039;s economic recovery.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
NEPAD argues that globalisation will provide Africa with opportunities to grow economically and achieve unprecedented poverty reduction.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
African heads of state committed to NEPAD see it as a pledge based on a common vision and a firm and shared conviction, that they have a pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to place their countries, both individually and collectively, on a path of sustainable growth and development, and at the same time to participate actively in the world economy and body politic. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Programme document further notes that NEPAD is anchored on the determination of Africans to extricate themselves and the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and exclusion in a globalising world. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It includes a commitment by African leaders to African people and the international community to place Africa on a path of sustainable growth, accelerating the integration of the continent into the global economy. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It calls on the rest of the world to partner Africa in its development based on Africa&#039;s own agenda and programme of action. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ownership of NEPAD<br />
<br />
The launch of the African Union in South Africa (July 2003) raised a lot of questions around the ownership of NEPAD and the exact meaning of what the heads of State thought of it as a concrete expression of Africa&#039;s desire to develop in a new environment that seeks new partnerships with peoples of Africa and western powers that have traditionally provided Africa with development assistance mainly in the form of loans and grants.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Civil society and NEPAD<br />
<br />
African civil society which historically has been marginalised by the African states in the arena of policy formulation found itself engaging the programme at a moment when governments were seeking the sector&#039;s support in endorsing it as a truly African initiative that could be marketed to donors outside the continent. This gesture by African heads of state prompted civil society to give a very impressive response on a Pan-African level, but with little or no grounding in the various nation states. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This was achieved through professional network discussions in workshops and seminars resulting in a plethora of statements and publications too numerous to recount for this presentation but suffice it to say that, all expressed disgust with the lack of broad-based consultation and NEPAD&#039;s top-down, one-size-fits-all approach. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This argument was to reverberate throughout Africa.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this led to a situation where most citizens found themselves digesting the articulate critiques of NEPAD that left them with no intention to familiarise themselves with the actual pronouncements made in the document.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
An on-going MWENGO-initiated survey on the state of NEPAD in Eastern and Southern Africa notes that the lack of consultation has remained a thorny issue that has forced civil society to pursue the programme largely in negative terms.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Civil society ideologues have repeatedly harped on NEPAD&#039;s admission that it will be successful &quot;...only if it is owned by the African peoples united in their diversity,&quot; (paragraph 51, page 13).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A number in Zambia for example, hailed its spirit of appealing to the African people for support, but still stressed that no one from their Government has gone out of their way to challenge their critical engagement of NEPAD, let alone mobilise them to support sections they agree with.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This action and failure by African leaders and their representatives to move on this front, has its roots in the fact that while some sections of the document allude to the importance of popular participation, others try to justify the top-down approach taken, contending that: &quot;...We believe that while African leaders derive their mandates from their people, it is their role to articulate these plans and lead the processes of implementation on behalf of their people,&quot; (paragraph 47, page 11). <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thus, NEPAD reduces the role of civil society as follows: &quot;We are, therefore, asking the African peoples to take up the challenge of mobilising in support of the implementation of this initiative by setting up, at all levels, structures for organisation, mobilisation and action,&quot; (paragraph 56, page 13). <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The role of civil society is reduced to one of merely supporting the initiative. In this regard, NEPAD takes a highly (and discredited) paternalistic approach to its people.<br />
<br />
By choosing this top-down approach, NEPAD ignores lessons from past strategies. Even the World Bank and IMF, masters of the top-down Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs), have come around to accept that ownership of development strategies by people is critical to their success, and hence late in 1999, they adopted the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which are supposed to be government-led, but people-driven. (The PRSPs do have their own shortcomings, but that is not the subject of our current discussion, suffice to say they are there because of the realisation by the IMF and World Bank of the inadequacies of top-down, one-size-fits-all approaches.) <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This position and critique is well developed in South Africa, Mauritius, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Namibia, Uganda, Kenya and Uganda.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Its proponents spelt out that the African governments adopted the African Charter on Popular Participation at Arusha (Tanzania) in 1990 as the continent&#039;s operational framework. It is therefore unfortunate that NEPAD violates a key principle of popular participation, adopted by African governments themselves.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
On the continental level, this view was reiterated in the Addis Ababa, January 2003 African Social Forum and popularised at the global level during the Porto Alegre, World Social summit where the African delegates stated that NEPAD is based on the discredited neo-liberal approach which promotes free markets and free trade.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
NEPAD seeks to integrate Africa into the global world on the basis of free markets and free trade. NEPAD enjoins African countries to implement &#039;...far reaching reforms and programmes,&#039; (paragraph 23, page 6), without elaborating on what these entail. In development discourse, such a reference refers to SAPs. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is confirmed in the following paragraph (24) which argues that the SAPs implemented in the 1980s provided only a partial solution: &quot;...they promoted reforms that tended to remove serious price distortions, but gave inadequate attention to the provision of social services,&quot; (page 6). The analytical part of NEPAD observed that the current phase of globalisation undermines African recovery and development, and yet the proposed solution is steeped in further integrating Africa into a faulty world economy, without addressing its inequalities and injustices.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Civil society points out repeatedly that African governments are short-changing citizens whenever they talk of partnership in NEPAD. They argue that the concept of &#039;Partnership&#039;, a cornerstone of NEPAD, is outward rather than inward oriented. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The new partnership is with the Northern development partners, and not African civil society. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
NEPAD states clearly that the programme is &quot;...a call for a new relationship between Africa and the international community, especially the highly industrialised countries, to overcome the development chasm that has widened over centuries of unequal relations,&quot; (paragraph 8, page 2). It makes it plain that: &quot;...the programme is a new framework of interaction with the rest of the world, including the industrialised countries and multilateral organisations,&quot; (paragraph 48, page 11).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
While African leaders have been at the forefront in criticising the World Bank and IMF for promoting top-down, one-size-fits-all SAPs, they are guilty of the same sin in developing and promoting a top-down, one-size-fits-all NEPAD. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A meeting which was held recently in Arusha, Tanzania and attended by more than twenty people from Eastern and Southern Africa, which sought to sensitize participants on the importance of the East African Community, found itself debating the issue of partnership. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The participants felt that the EAC was promoting a vision rooted in the controversial neo-liberal approach and had not articulated the role of civil society except that of the private sector which they felt was being touted as an engine of the growth. One irate participant equated the EAC to a little NEPAD secretariat as he could not comprehend the complimentarily of the institution&#039;s visions after it had been pointed out that these organs had not met officially to see how they could work together. This coincidence of vision is an issue East Africans will have to interrogate when they discuss the role of regional economic blocs in the promotion of continental economic programmes espoused under NEPAD.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The meeting also highlighted the need to harmonise visions in the areas of peace and security as it was pointed out that the East African region and the horn of Africa were using IGAD to pursue peace initiatives in that area.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
One other initiative worth noting for the NEPAD engagement was the Kenya series of public talks held in March under the theme &quot;Our World Is not for Sale&quot; and &quot;Another Africa is possible&quot;. Showcasing Yash Tandon, a Zimbabwean-based anti-globalisation activist as the lead discussant, Kenyans from all walks of life debated the various themes arising out of NEPAD and most of the remarks from this town and gown format of meeting pointed to another rejection of NEPAD. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Ugandans who also engaged Yash Tandon as one of the lead discussants took the Kenya line, but the levels of enthusiasm were not the same.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the course of the year 2002, Deniva a network of indigenous voluntary associations well known for their advocacy around home grown and people centred paradigms, policies and strategies pledged to mount a series of activities to ensure that Ugandans understand NEPAD. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
As late as December 2002, participants at a Consumer Education Trust of Uganda meeting still lamented the lack of knowledge on NEPAD among the country&#039;s citizens. At this meeting, participants felt that the government had directed civil society&#039;s energy into PRSPs leaving very little room for a more concerted effort to understand the dynamics of NEPAD.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
As we speak, another initiative has been put in place in Uganda to raise the challenges posed by NEPAD, but the modus operandi for the implementation is still yet to be availed. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In past civil society engagements, the efforts were directed at critiquing rather than adopting NEPAD. These were largely led by academia or fairly radical sections of civil society who see NEPAD as a subtle continuation of the neo-liberal agenda but seemingly giving the initiative to the African elite to take forward.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The government has been challenged to embark on a vigorous and coherent public campaign to educate the public on the objectives of NEPAD and solicit their participation<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Moreover, there hasn&#039;t been an identified champion with the necessary resources within civil society to take the expanded public dialogue forward. The NGO Forum has been sighted and currently seems the best placed to carry this agenda forward.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It has been argued that infact there may be need for a two-track approach where at one level we are taking to the public the minimum agenda where it may be easy to have consensus and actually make some discernable progress including trying to attain greater transparency and accountability between policy makers (particularly those involved in NEPAD) and the public.  At the other level, a more restricted discussion on conceptual issues, developing a vision and reaching a consensus on how the continent can be actually transformed and the implications of NEPAD on the broader development agenda i.e. another track should focus on the more fundamental issues that NEPAD and other approaches raise about Africa&#039;s development.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ugandan Civil society is proposing that broad based public dialogue between the citizenry, civil society, politicians and government technocrats and legislators could more profitably focus on the minimum agenda. And that if these aspects are not separated, public meetings, dialogue on NEPAD end up generating more heat than light. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Mauritian civil society has stuck to its March 2002 position tabulated in the Common Declaration adopted by NGOs, CBOs, trade unions, women&#039;s, youth, planters, fishermen, education &amp; research organisations which was structured as a twelve point document.<br />
<br />
They noted that NEPAD has not been subjected to any democratic debate neither in Mauritius nor in any African countries.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
1.      NEPAD is rather a project being steered through by an African elite in conjunction with the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and the G8. <br />
<br />
2.      NEPAD is based on the assumption that the present corporate-led globalisation represents progress for humanity. This is not the case at all. <br />
<br />
3.      NEPAD contains many of the contested conditionalities of the IMF/WB; such as the Structural Adjustment Program, the neo-liberal economic policies and the cuts on social spending that have largely contributed to aggravate poverty in Africa. <br />
<br />
4.      NEPAD is proposing a development strategy that threatens the economic and social rights of the African people and may lead to the re-colonisation of Africa by multinational companies.<br />
<br />
5.       NEPAD is making an economic projection of 7% growth, which seems unrealistic under the present context of globalisation. <br />
<br />
They concluded by calling on all African organisations, whether trade unions, social, women&#039;s, youth or peasants&#039; organisations, as well as academics, to take a firm stand against the NEPAD.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The government was told that &quot;Given that there has not been any democratic debate on NEPAD and given that the NEPAD contains serious threats to our people, we call on the Mauritian government NOT to go ahead with the presentation of NEPAD in the coming G8 meeting and its launch in July 2002.&quot; <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Indicators in Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland point to a very underdeveloped discourse on NEPAD. While the exact cause has not been established, it is important to note some sections of civil society in these respective countries have engaged NEPAD via the Johannesburg Earth Summit procedures and parallel meetings which were put in place last year during the preparations for the launch of the African Union.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The position that was dominant during the processes highlighted that members of civil society who met all over Africa prior to the launch of the African Union and subsequently, in Port Shepstone on the eve of the launch, clearly rejected NEPAD after analysing it in the context of the struggles for development and emancipation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
That was a very bold position when one considered the fact that in terms of publicity, African media and conventional wisdom had led many to believe that NEPAD was going to be the issue in Durban, notwithstanding the fact that the legitimacy of this programme was inextricably fused with the successful transformation of the OAU to the African Union.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the African civil society declaration on NEPAD whose clarion call was &quot;We do not accept NEPAD!! Africa is not for sale&quot;, social movements, trade unions, youth and women&#039;s organisations, faith based organisations, academics, NGOs and other popular civil society organisations unequivocally stated that they will continue to build popular movements at national, continental and international levels against neo-liberal economic globalisation, and against the world trade Organisation as the main institutional force driving globalisation.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
What was ignored?<br />
<br />
The NEPAD document was seen as having ignored the thinking embodied in The 1980 Lagos Plan of Action, 1991 Abuja Treaty, the 1989 alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes (AAF-SAAP), the African charter for popular participation and development (Arusha charter, 1990) and the 1994 Cairo Agenda.<br />
<br />
These constituted efforts by Africans to resolve the continent&#039;s crises without placing emphasis on resources from the west.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Strategic thinking and agenda setting<br />
<br />
This was a very important gesture in terms of strategic thinking and agenda setting.<br />
<br />
But most importantly, they highlighted the fact that NEPAD seemed to ignore the fact that African states have been undermined as social providers and vehicles of development particularly under the tutelage of the World Bank.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Their position was a declaration of war on NEPAD as they called on the African people to mobilise for a developmental participatory state responsive to people&#039;s needs and aspirations. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It was also reiterated that there was need to build popular and democratic movements that can hold African states accountable to their responsibilities.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
In short, Africa needed a very strong state whose capacity in terms of delivering social services would remain unwavering and perhaps be stronger than what has remained in the aftermath of the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Who endorsed NEPAD?<br />
<br />
Heads of states were not unanimous in their endorsement of NEPAD. <br />
<br />
Some ridiculed its assumed dependency on western mobilized financial resources which they strongly resented because of the conditionalities that they impose on the recipient states with the most stringent being applied by the IMF and the World Bank. Bilateral financial arrangements have often benefited the donor and only strengthened the capacity of the recipient to efficiently deliver goods and services deemed strategic for the donor nation or organisation. As a result, it was very difficult for Presidents Mbeki, Obassanjo and Wade, the triumvirate often associated with NEPAD to go back home and proudly pronounce that NEPAD was as purely home grown as was the other institution the African Union they had just launched.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Point of Engagement<br />
<br />
NEPAD had serious weaknesses and it is these that we should use to push for further democratisation of the African state and an increased role for civil society to shape and influence any policies that are deemed a panacea for developing Africa and eradicating the ever increasing poverty levels the majority of the continent&#039;s citizens face and are subjected to. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
There is the issue of NEPAD accepting the fundamentals of the neo-liberal project and gender-blind SAPs paradigm which has been largely responsible for the deepening of the African crises, including the feminisation of poverty.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Arguments vs NEPAD<br />
<br />
It is interesting to note that some of the states that questioned the NEPAD philosophy used the arguments that had been refined in civil society forums.<br />
<br />
This gesture in turn confused many activists who were to be seen in the corridors of the Durban African Union summit rubbing shoulders with government bureaucrats and promising to go out and popularise NEPAD. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with entertaining state officials and promising to work with them. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The challenge for us is to impress upon them that NEPAD will not create the kind of partnerships envisaged by the masses in whose name civil society is calling on governments to consult, act and then be held accountable.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The AU<br />
<br />
Those who are not yet familiar with AU structures will find it instructive that some of the organs the new organisation seeks to operationalise are directly associated with NEPAD proposals. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
These relate to peace and security, gender equity and equality and the controversial peer review system, an instrument that will hopefully constitute a barometer for measuring a state&#039;s adherence to democracy, human rights and adherence to the rule of law.<br />
<br />
These core values have been ignored by many governments in the past but at this stage it is not easy to evade them as Africa is busy exploring ways and means of achieving meaningful peace and security which goes beyond the absence of conflict as a common denominator for all to prosper.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The AU was marked by unprecedented political will and civil society has new and unlimited opportunities to engage their governments on the basis of the rhetoric and relative openness that characterised Durban.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
With or without NEPAD, these expectations are not out of place because in the constitutive Act of the AU, sections of Article 3 binds the union to promote democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance; promote and protect human and people&#039;s rights in accordance with the African charter on Human and Peoples&#039; rights and other human rights instruments.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Where does that leave Civil Society?<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, civil society should not the miss the AU omnibus in carving out more space to discourse on Africa&#039;s development path. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It is out of this realisation that we are currently initiating and participating in a regional initiative to build capacity within civil society organisations to engage once again with the African Union and revisit our views and articulations of NEPAD that have developed in the past year.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We are arguing that the official launch of the African Union (AU) in July 2002 has provided African civil society with unlimited opportunities to engage national governments on the controversial aspects surrounding the much talked about New Economic Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development (NEPAD).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Guided by the MWENGO Economic Policy Project mission statement:<br />
<br />
To contribute to people-cantered policy changes for the economic transformation of Africa through social mobilization and a vision rooted in the quest for an economic order founded on justice equity and sustainable development, we seek to build a critical mass of civil society organisations in the region to advocate for people-centred economic policies and programmes, and to foster collaboration between NGOs, the media, academics, faith-based organisations, unions and various social movements to reverse the marginalisation of citizens from policy and decision making in the different areas of economic policy and governance in the region.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
To effectively do this, a country&#039;s citizens should be availed with knowledge and information which when accessed can help them make informed choices.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We propose to consolidate our campaign aimed at equipping society with basic knowledge of the Constitutive Act of the African Union in general and focus more on why civil society has repeatedly affirmed that NEPAD was a neo-liberal sell-out programme.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It is also proposed that advocacy and lobbying opportunities that might arise during the implementation of the campaign must be undertaken, bearing in mind that some civil society organizations agreed to engage with the issues raised in NEPAD as part of their broad struggles against the neo-liberal agenda imposed by the IFIs and the WTO.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Our discourse located in the AU discussions will be about understanding the national, regional and global economy and Africa&#039;s places within it. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Armed with a common tool for engendering broad public participation in debating and setting economic policy, the campaign should promote a framework for revealing the structural causes of economic and social problems. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We will seek to challenge destructive myths, to create positive policy alternatives, and to enhance community/neighbourhood alternatives.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Given the abundance of primary and secondary material in existence on NEPAD so far, the campaign should be a process of sharing specific economic, political and social analysis and information with various groups in accessible, participatory ways. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Beyond the seminar and workshops and even this meeting, the campaign must be designed in such a way that it will develop tools to make complex ideas understandable and to uncover systemic issues behind what we observe.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Civil Society and social movements all over Africa should recommit themselves to<br />
<br />
- starting a process of public information and debate on NEPAD, by explaining the programme and presenting the responses from different quarters on the programme<br />
<br />
- dialogue between citizens, civil society, government officials, politicians and legislators about NEPAD<br />
<br />
- greater accountability between policy makers (particularly those involved in the NEPAD process) and the public<br />
<br />
- clarity at the country level about the implications of NEPAD and development of a broader national position<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We have one product &quot;Grappling with the New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development (NEPAD): The Debate in Namibia&quot; prepared by Barney Karuuombe, of the Labour resource and research Institute (LaRRI), that can be circulated to those who are interested in the above initiative.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
<br />
Our intentions are also shared by other civic organisations and we see it fit to conclude using some of their words.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions argues that the major issues that civil society organizations, workers and trade unions alike, are grappling with or are trying to understand include the issue of whether the NEPAD project can be &quot;made to work for the poor in light of such inherent inconsistencies.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The intentions of NEPAD are noble only in so far as they claim to be an initiative in which African leaders have played a part. It however falls far short from rescuing the African masses from the poverty grip. <br />
<br />
Even though some of NEPAD&#039;s stated goals may be well intentioned, the development vision and economic measures that it puts across for the realizations of these goals are either flawed in that they do not reflect the problems affecting Africans in general and workers in particular or makes heavy reliance on past discredited IMF, World Bank programmes. As a result, NEPAD in its present form does not and will not contribute to making Africa a better place for the average worker. It does not explicitly recognize the role of the worker in development; neither does it explicitly uphold the rights of the worker throughout its deliberations. It relies on the assumption that NEPAD&#039;s benefit to the worker can only come through indirect &quot;trickle down&quot; effects. This has not worked in the past (under IMF, World Bank programmes) and there is no reason to expect that it will work now.<br />
The assumptions of NEPAD and other policy initiatives therefore need to be challenged, in order to adopt a more people-cantered, transformative framework. The elements of this people-cantered vision to development are located within the context of the workers and civil society&#039;s experience with globalization in Africa and elsewhere. The way forward then, is for NEPAD to turn to these people, understand the lessons learnt and then move.<br />

<p>The generosity of computer magnate Bill Gates in giving money to African Aids victims isn&#039;t as simple as you might think, says this article.  Gate&#x2019;s demi-trillionaire status is based on a nasty little monopoly-protecting trade treaty called &#x201C;TRIPS&#x201D; &#x2013; the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights rules of the World Trade Organisation.  TRIPS gives Gates a hammerlock on computer operating systems worldwide, legally granting him the kind of monopoly the Robber Barons of yore could only dream of.  But TRIPS, the rule which helps Gates rule, also bars African governments from buying AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis medicine at cheap market prices. </p><br class='clearme' /></div><div><h3>africa: Global Aids Fund Faces Serious Shortfall</h3><h4>2003-07-17</h4><h4><a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200307160457.html">http://allafrica.com/stories/200307160457.html</a></h4>

<p>The Aids virus is becoming increasingly resistant to the drugs used to treat it, researchers say.

<p>Nigerian HIV/AIDS activists under the aegis of the Treatment Action Movement (TAM), a coalition of civil society groups working in the area of HIV/AIDS treatment and care, have called on U.S. President George W.

PRESS ALERT<br />
<br />
Nigeria activists charge Bush to back commitment with action<br />
<br />
JULY 10, 2003:  As Nigeria prepares to play host to President George Bush on<br />
Friday, Nigerian HIV/AIDS activists under the aegis of the Treatment Action<br />
Movement (TAM) a coalition of civil society groups working in the area of<br />
HIV/AIDS treatment and care have called on the American leader to ensure<br />
that his AIDS policies are not merely rhetoric, but focus on improving the<br />
quality of lives of the continent&#039;s 30 million People living with HIV/AIDS.<br />
<br />
In a statement issued by the group on Thursday, TAM urged the   American<br />
President to match his pronouncements on expanding access to treatment for<br />
PLWHA in Africa with corresponding action.<br />
<br />
We commend the President&#039;s pronouncements made in his State of the Union<br />
address of a comprehensive plan that will prevent 7 million new HIV<br />
infections, and treat 2 million people living with HIV/AIDS on our continent<br />
as well as his pledge to commit $15 billion over the next five years, to<br />
turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the<br />
Caribbean.<br />
<br />
However, the Bush Administration needs to live up to that commitment by<br />
providing the commensurate resources starting from the 2004 fiscal year.<br />
True commitment will be demonstrated on the part of the Bush Administration<br />
when  $3 billion is allotted for HIV/AIDS interventions for Africa and<br />
sustained over the next five years.<br />
<br />
Apart from sustained support from Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the group<br />
also called on the Bush administration to release the full amount pledged to<br />
the Global Fund.<br />
<br />
&quot;In its short existence, The Global Fund has proved itself as a veritable<br />
tool for addressing the continent&#039;s AIDS situation. Yet, it is still under<br />
funded.  Prompt support for the Fund is much needed and will be a step in<br />
the right direction&quot;, the group said.<br />
<br />
The group also stressed the need to strengthen and expand access to<br />
prevention of mother-to child initiatives and treatment. We wish to remind<br />
the President of his promise which he made in 2002  &quot;to treat one million<br />
women annually, and reduce mother-to-child transmission by 40 percent within<br />
five years or less in target countries. &quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;We believe these are not just empty promises. There is very little we can<br />
do as positive women if we&#039;re denied the opportunity to have children<br />
because we&#039;re afraid we&#039;ll have what our doctors call AIDS babies.   The<br />
only way this can be challenged is if we have access to affordable<br />
life-saving drugs to treat opportunistic infections and prevent mother to<br />
child transmission.<br />
<br />
For as long as we allow the pharmaceutical companies to put their profits<br />
ahead of our lives, everything we say and do would be all rhetoric,<br />
beautiful nonsense. We&#039;ve lost our friends, husbands, sisters and babies to<br />
AIDS.  We cannot afford to purchase our lives at the price the<br />
Pharmaceutical companies are charging&quot;, TAM&#039;s focal person Ms. Rolake Nwagwu<br />
stated.<br />
<br />
The group also expressed concern over the United States rigid stance on<br />
trade policies that could likely limit the continued access to generic<br />
versions of drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and a host of<br />
other diseases plaguing the continent.<br />
<br />
&quot; U.S. trade representatives continue to block implementation of the 2001<br />
Doha Declaration on trade which calls for looser patent rules in order to<br />
give African countries greater access to essential anti-AIDS drugs.<br />
Enactment of trade policies that will ensure that public health benefits are<br />
placed ahead of the profit motives of the U.S&#039; pharmaceutical industries<br />
will be the litmus test of President Bush&#039;s commitment to an expanded access<br />
to treatment programme.<br />
<br />
&quot;Access to ARVs under Nigeria&#039;s treatment programme has given about 8,000<br />
people hope. This treatment still comes at a great cost to many. Expanding<br />
access to generic antiretrovirals, and anti-TB drugs amongst others the<br />
programme will make many more PLWHA dreams of living normal healthy lives a<br />
reality&quot;, said Olayide Akanni, of  Journalists of Against AIDS (JAAIDS),<br />
Nigeria<br />

SPARE OUR DRUMS: BUSH TOUCHES DOWN AMIDST WAILING NOT<br />
DANCING<br />
<br />
Today, July 11, 2003 President Bush, leader of the United<br />
States of America the wealthiest nation in the world, steps<br />
foot at Entebbe International Airport. On this day when<br />
President Bush arrives, 18,000 people are estimated to die<br />
from AIDS in Africa alone.<br />
<br />
In African tradition an important visitor is welcomed with<br />
drums, dancing and singing. However President Bush, arrival<br />
will be received with mothers wailing for the loss of their<br />
children: adults and infants to AIDS and toddlers to<br />
Malaria.<br />
<br />
Hence, President Bush&#039;s visit is the only opportunity<br />
through which USA has to deliver on the AIDS Emergency Plan<br />
which is now over 6 months old and no single life is known<br />
to have been saved by it.<br />
<br />
We call upon President Museveni to take his counterpart to<br />
some graveyards of children who have died of AIDS. These<br />
have died because we are so poor to give them life saving<br />
drugs, which cost less than $1 per day. No cover up this<br />
time. President Bush has come to see for himself the<br />
disaster a preventable terror has caused to Uganda, a<br />
country with the largest number of AIDS orphans in the<br />
whole world.<br />
<br />
We also request President Museveni to use this opportunity<br />
to indeed lead the way by advising President Bush that the<br />
struggle against AIDS is a concerted, one which calls for<br />
all tools to be drawn at the same time, not only abstinence<br />
as it portrayed as the cause of the so called Uganda&#039;s<br />
success story.<br />
<br />
With his tears rolling, President Bush should leave Africa<br />
with the $3 billion cheque for 2004 to fight AIDS signed,<br />
with an immediate plan to put more money into the Kofi<br />
Annan Global Fund. The Fund now lacks only $600 million to<br />
meet the financing obligation of an estimated 100 programs<br />
from about 60 countries from all over the world to respond<br />
to AIDS, TB and malaria.. Nothing is beyond the authority<br />
of President Bush in the world. <br />
<br />
The President by a phone call can ask Congress for even a<br />
billion dollars for the Global Fund in emergency funding.<br />
The Global Fund has proved itself to be the most economical<br />
and demand driven process of getting hope to the lives of<br />
individuals and families who have been rendered helpless by<br />
diseases.<br />
<br />
Using the WHO estimates, 3 million of the 42 million people<br />
living with HIV/AIDS in the world need treatment in the<br />
next three years. In Uganda, with an estimated 1.5m people<br />
living with HIV/AIDS, approximately 105,000 Ugandans living<br />
with HIV/AIDS will need treatment in the next 3-4 years.<br />
<br />
Using the offer of CIPLA Company of an annual cost of $600 <br />
for treating one person, President Museveni needs $63<br />
million per year to treat his nationals living with<br />
HIV/AIDS and save them from preventable deaths. Therefore,<br />
if President Museveni got a cheque, or a firm promissory<br />
note of $315 million, he would be able to disable the<br />
&quot;mustard seed&quot; that is just ready to grow into another<br />
&quot;beautiful green&quot; AIDS epidemic in a country that is<br />
celebrated for having conquered AIDS.<br />
<br />
This is not a visit of looking good, but displaying the<br />
evil disease has caused to Uganda and Africa in general. It<br />
is a visit of acting good and bringing smiles to the cheeks<br />
of youngsters whose lives will be spared from AIDS through<br />
sustainable prevention and educational efforts. It is visit<br />
of bringing hope to the aging who will look forward to<br />
their children to put them to rest not vice versa. To<br />
frontline workers, it is a visit for transforming the AIDS<br />
response in Africa.<br />

STATEMENT OF ZIMBABWE ACTIVISTS ON HIV &amp; AIDS ON PRESIDENT <br />
BUSH&#039;S VISIT TO SOUTH AFRICA <br />
<br />
9 July 2003 <br />
<br />
Zimbabwe Activists on HIV &amp; AIDS is an activist<br />
organisation formed in January 2003, and its vision is the<br />
attainment of universal HIV/AIDS treatment in Zimbabwe. The<br />
formation of ZAHA was in response to the grim realities of<br />
the dire situation in Zimbabwe where the pandemic has now<br />
reached disaster proportions, and is now the leading cause<br />
of death in the country. <br />
<br />
Whilst we applaud President Bush&#039;s visit to this part of<br />
the world, his stance and commitment to HIV/AIDS treatment,<br />
as well as his US$15 billion financial package to help with<br />
treatment in Africa and the Caribbean, we are also<br />
painfully aware that Zimbabwe is not listed as a recipient<br />
of the President&#039;s philanthropy. We are in no doubt of the<br />
fact that the exclusion of this country is linked to the <br />
relentless and persistent human rights abuses in this<br />
country, and the explicit demands by Washington that<br />
democracy and good governance be restored. <br />
<br />
It is apparent that the President&#039;s mission to South Africa<br />
has a heavy bias on engaging President Thabo Mbeki to<br />
commit himself to Washington&#039;s agenda vis-à­¶is Zimbabwe&#039;s<br />
political situation, but apparently nothing on helping<br />
Zimbabwe combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. <br />
<br />
We want President Bush to know that, as much as we have a<br />
political problem, we have a bigger HIV/AIDS problem in<br />
Zimbabwe. We have an infection rate of 34% of the adult<br />
population; we have a death rate of at least 500 deaths per<br />
day from AIDS-related illnesses, and our life expectancy is<br />
now perilously low at less than 40 years. An estimated 2,3<br />
million people are infected, including about 240 000<br />
orphans, and about 600 000 of these are in need of<br />
antiretroviral therapy. Only 1% of these are on the<br />
therapy. For the rest, the cost of the therapy is simply<br />
beyond their reach and is therefore not an option. <br />
<br />
We also want President Bush to know that, as much as<br />
Zimbabweans have had to endure the current economic and<br />
political challenges, people infected and affected by<br />
HIV/AIDS have borne the brunt of this terrible situation.<br />
The current drought has worsened their plight and robbed<br />
them of the nutrition that they desperately need to boost<br />
their immune systems. The political situation, which the<br />
President is most concerned about, has severely affected<br />
them as they are in no way to defend them in this violent<br />
atmosphere. The Zimbabwean Government, currently facing<br />
severe economic challenges, has not taken concrete steps to<br />
enable PWA&#039;s to access treatment, and this situation is<br />
likely to persist for as long as the necessary resources<br />
are outside of its reach. If no immediate intervention<br />
programs are launched to target the 99% who are not on<br />
antiretroviral therapy, the death rate will certainly reach<br />
genocide proportions. <br />
<br />
Finally, we want President Bush to know that the people<br />
infected by HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe are not the authors of the<br />
status quo, and ought not to be excluded from any treatment<br />
initiatives meant to alleviate the plight of other PWA&#039;s in<br />
Africa and the Caribbean merely because of<br />
Government-to-Government hostilities. Whilst he has made<br />
his position on our President clear, he certainly has no<br />
beef with the hundreds of thousands who are suffering and<br />
who urgently need help. There is no reason why they should<br />
not be included in the US$15 billion facility, which will<br />
enable them to access treatment and restore their lives,<br />
their dignity and their hopes. <br />
<br />
It must be noted that other non-governmental organisations<br />
have taken steps to introduce HIV/AIDS treatment, including<br />
antiretroviral therapy, in Zimbabwe, despite the adverse<br />
conditions. SAfAIDS has launched a crusade aimed at ARV<br />
awareness in Zimbabwe, and several mission hospitals like<br />
Luisa Guidotti in Mutoko have started dispensing the<br />
therapy. Private companies like De Beers and Delta<br />
Corporation are giving the drugs to their employees. Family<br />
Aids Caring Trust, the largest Aids Service Organisation in<br />
Zimbabwe, has launched an access to treatment project<br />
called LIFE Project, which will also be dispensing ARV<br />
drugs in and around Mutare. However, given the absence of<br />
substantial funding and long-term sustainability, these<br />
projects are likely to benefit a few out of the hundreds of<br />
thousands in need. <br />
<br />
We trust that the President will put Zimbabwe on his map on<br />
HIV/AIDS intervention, and make a difference in the lives<br />
of countless infected and affected Zimbabweans. <br />

<p>Two influential Islamic groups in Nigeria have urged Muslims to resist the government&#x2019;s immunisation programme aimed at eradicating the polio virus.

<p>The child sex trade is a multibillion-dollar industry.  Girls and boys are bought and sold like commodities and sexually exploited for commercial gain.  What is the international community doing to end this inhumane trade?  Can it succeed?  A paper from UNICEF reports from the front line of the fight to give vulnerable children the right to protection from abuse, as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Drawing on testimonies from children and leading figures in the child protection movement, it debunks myths, calls for zero tolerance of traffickers and suggests how international agencies, police forces, legislators, judges and educators can do more to end the scourge.</p><br class='clearme' /></div><div><h3>africa: UNICEF Calls for Total Ban of Child Soldiers</h3><h4>2003-07-17</h4><h4><a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200307110442.html">http://allafrica.com/stories/200307110442.html</a></h4>

After the Holocaust, the world said &quot;never again.&quot; And yet, less than a decade ago, the international community turned away from genocide in Rwanda.

**Updates IFEX alert of 8 July 2003**<br />
<br />
(CPJ/IFEX) - The following is an 8 July 2003 letter to African Union General<br />
Secretary Amara Essy:<br />
<br />
July 8, 2003<br />
<br />
His Excellency Amara Essy<br />
Secretary General<br />
African Union<br />
African Union Headquarters<br />
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia<br />
<br />
Via facsimile: 251-1-51-2622/3036<br />
<br />
Your Excellency,<br />
<br />
On the eve of the Assembly of Heads of State at the African Union (AU)<br />
summit in Maputo, Mozambique, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is<br />
writing to express deep concern over the state of press freedom in Africa.<br />
<br />
We are dismayed that the issue of press freedom does not appear on the<br />
conference agenda. Outgoing AU chairperson, South African president Thabo<br />
Mbeki, recently stated that a principal responsibility of the organization<br />
is &quot;to ensure that the entirety of our continent enjoys peace, stability and<br />
democracy.&quot; But as long as journalists&#039; rights are suppressed, and they are<br />
not free to report on official injustices, such as corruption and other<br />
hindrances to development, the AU will not be able to fulfill its mandate.<br />
<br />
We hope that Your Excellency will use your authority to ensure that the<br />
issue of press freedom in Africa is addressed at this conference, and that<br />
it remains on the AU agenda in the future. We also hope that you will use<br />
the occasion of the Maputo summit to encourage AU members to improve<br />
conditions for the media in their respective countries.<br />
<br />
Since CPJ last wrote Your Excellency in August 2002, AU member governments&#039;<br />
have done little to improve their treatment of journalists. Reporters in<br />
several countries are routinely harassed, while media outlets are censored<br />
in reprisal for their work. Governments in many African countries continue<br />
to use repressive legislation to restrict coverage and imprison journalists.<br />
Currently, 25 are imprisoned in AU member states because of their work,<br />
according to CPJ research.<br />
<br />
CPJ is particularly disturbed by the press freedom records of the following<br />
countries:<br />
<br />
* Eritrea: Since September 2001, when the government shut down the country&#039;s<br />
entire independent press and began arresting journalists, Eritrea has had<br />
the continent&#039;s most appalling press freedom record. Seventeen journalists<br />
currently languish in prison there, nearly all of them held incommunicado in<br />
unknown locations. Many other journalists have fled the country to avoid<br />
persecution. Eritrean authorities have called the journalists &quot;mercenaries&quot;<br />
and &quot;spies&quot; and have accused them of spreading disinformation and creating<br />
division in the country.<br />
<br />
* Ethiopia: The Ethiopian government continues to use its repressive Press<br />
Proclamation No. 34/1992 to criminally prosecute and imprison journalists.<br />
Two journalists are currently in jail there, one of whom has been in prison<br />
for more than a year. Though the Ethiopian Parliament passed a new<br />
broadcasting law in 1999, the government has still not fulfilled its promise<br />
to grant broadcasting licenses to private operators. Meanwhile, Ethiopian<br />
authorities are preparing to introduce a new press bill to Parliament, early<br />
drafts of which include harsh criminal penalties for press offenses, place<br />
severe restrictions on media ownership, and allow the government broad<br />
powers of censorship.<br />
<br />
* Togo: CPJ recently named Togo one of the world&#039;s 10 Worst Places to be a<br />
Journalist. Togolese authorities have shuttered independent broadcasters,<br />
blocked news Web sites, seized entire editions of critical newspapers, and<br />
arrested journalists in reprisal for their work. Three journalists are<br />
currently in prison in Togo, all charged with &quot;publishing false information<br />
and disturbing public order&quot; for electronically scanning photographs of<br />
alleged disturbances during the recent presidential elections. In September<br />
2002, the Togolese Parliament passed an amendment to the Press Code that<br />
compounded its already harsh punishments. Togolese journalists can now be<br />
imprisoned for up to five years for &quot;insulting the Head of State.&quot;<br />
<br />
* Zimbabwe: The government of Zimbabwe has continued its crackdown on<br />
independent journalists, using repressive legislation passed in early 2002<br />
to prosecute those who criticize the ruling ZANU-PF regime. Though the<br />
country&#039;s Supreme Court struck down a section of the infamous Access to<br />
Information and Protection of Privacy Act in early May, authorities have<br />
used other means to harass reporters; ruling-party supporters attack<br />
journalists with impunity and seize copies of critical newspapers from<br />
vendors. In mid-May, immigration officials forcibly removed independent<br />
reporter Andrew Meldrum from the country, despite court rulings ordering his<br />
release, after Meldrum penned several articles on the economic and political<br />
crises in the country.<br />
<br />
While CPJ believes that these countries are the most egregious violators of<br />
journalists&#039; rights, the trends of harassment, intimidation, and<br />
imprisonment of reporters, as well as legal restrictions and censorship, are<br />
common across the continent. Authorities in many African countries continue<br />
to deny reporters access to government information, and to use criminal laws<br />
to stifle dissent and punish journalists who criticize ruling regimes.<br />
<br />
According to the AU&#039;s &quot;Constitutive Act,&quot; the union is designed to &quot;promote<br />
democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good<br />
governance&quot; and to &quot;promote sustainable development at the economic, social<br />
and cultural levels.&quot; As an organization of journalists dedicated to<br />
defending our colleagues worldwide, we believe that a free press is<br />
essential to attaining these goals. Journalists play a vital role in<br />
ensuring that citizens of African nations are informed about issues of<br />
public concern.<br />
<br />
Moreover, we respectfully remind Your Excellency that AU member states are<br />
committed to upholding the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of<br />
Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and People&#039;s Rights, including<br />
the right to freedom of expression.<br />
<br />
AU member states must uphold their commitments and allow the media in their<br />
countries to operate freely, without fear of reprisal. The AU should also<br />
promote the decriminalization of press offenses in all African countries. By<br />
guaranteeing freedom of expression and freedom of the press, the AU can help<br />
ensure democracy and stability across the continent.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Ann Cooper<br />
Executive Director<br />
<br />

ALERT AND UPDATE - CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC<br />

Journalist released, another faces legal harassment<br />

 <br />
**New case and update to previous IFEX alert of 15 July 2003**<br />
 <br />
(RSF/IFEX) - RSF has protested the arrest of Ferdinand Samba, publication director of the independent daily &quot;Le Démocrate&quot;, who was detained for four days, beyond the legal time limit for detentions in police custody.<br />
 <br />
The organisation has expressed concern about the deteriorating press freedom situation in the Central African Republic (CAR). &quot;This latest incarceration of a CAR journalist is all the more dismaying in that General François Bozizé&#039;s new regime had made specific commitments regarding media freedom and had earlier announced the decriminalisation of press law violations,&quot; RSF Secretary-General Robert Ménard said. &quot;The new CAR authorities even contacted our organisation in order to assure us of their goodwill. We can only deplore that their promises have not been respected,&quot; he added.<br />
 <br />
Samba was arrested on 11 July 2003 at 3:45 p.m. (local time) at the headquarters of the CAR Private and Independent Press Publishers&#039; Association (Groupement des éditeurs de la presse privée indépendante de Centrafrique, GEPPIC). He was placed in detention and interrogated at the police station in Bangui&#039;s port. The journalist was finally released on 15 July at 2:00 p.m. and was not charged with any offence. <br />
 <br />
Samba had written an article, published on 8 July, about the armed conflict in the country&#039;s north. He was accused of causing panic among local citizens in the region by disseminating &quot;alarming and incorrect information&quot;. He had reported that supporters of former president Ange-Félix Patassé had launched an attack on the city of Kaga Bandoro and that 30 people had died in the fighting.<br />
 <br />
In addition, Faustin Bambou, publication director of the twice-weekly &quot;Les Collines du Bas-Oubangui&quot;, was threatened and sought by the authorities after publishing an article on 3 July in which he criticised the privileges reportedly granted to Mahamat Youssouf, a Chadian national close to General Bozizé. He was summoned to the police station on 7 and 8 July and interrogated at length. His case file has since been sent to the state prosecutor.<br />
 <br />
Finally, on 3 July, a court in M&#039;Baiki, in southern CAR, sentenced Michel Ngokpele, publication director of &quot;Le quotidien de Bangui&quot; newspaper, to six months&#039; imprisonment with no parole for &quot;defamation by means of the press&quot; and &quot;incitement to ethnic hatred&quot; (see IFEX alert of 7 July 2003). He wrote an article in mid-May in which he implicated a doctor in the deaths of several patients at a local hospital. Police arrested Ngokpele on 18 May and transferred him to M&#039;Baiki prison.<br />

<p>Amnesty International has called for the immediate and unconditional release of Daher Ahmed Farah, an opposition party leader and director of his party&#039;s newspaper. Daher Ahmed Farah, a prisoner of conscience, has been repeatedly arrested because of his peacefully-held political opinions.  <br />
News Release Issued by the International Secretariat of Amnesty International<br />
AI Index: AFR 23/001/2003<br />
14 July 2003<br />
<br />
Amnesty International is calling for the immediate and unconditional <br />
release of Daher Ahmed Farah, an opposition party leader and director of <br />
his party&#039;s newspaper.<br />
<br />
Daher Ahmed Farah, a prisoner of conscience, has been repeatedly arrested <br />
because of his peacefully-held political opinions. He started a three-month <br />
prison sentence in Gabode prison in Djibouti-ville on 9 July 2003 after the <br />
prosecutor won an appeal against his acquittal on a charge of libel <br />
(diffamation) against the army&#039;s Chief of Staff and an army women&#039;s <br />
folklore group. The appeal court imposed a six-month prison sentence (with <br />
three months suspended), heavy damages and a fine, and banned the party&#039;s <br />
newspaper for six months.<br />
<br />
&quot;Public officials who consider themselves defamed have the right of reply <br />
and if that is insufficient they can legitimately resort to legal actions <br />
to defend their reputation,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;But this should <br />
not involve, as it has done in Daher Ahmed Farah&#039;s case, detention by the <br />
police, arbitrary refusal of bail (liberté provisoire), state prosecution <br />
and prison sentences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Djibouti&#039;s constitution guarantees freedom of the press, and just last year <br />
Djibouti ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, <br />
which protects the right to freedom of expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Criminal legislation contravening the right to freedom of expression, <br />
which the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#039; Rights has called &#039;a <br />
cornerstone of democracy&#039;, has been used to stifle media criticism of the <br />
authorities and silence a prominent peaceful opponent,&quot; said Amnesty <br />
International<br />
<br />
Background<br />
<br />
Daher Ahmed Farah is the president of the opposition Movement for <br />
Democratic Renewal and Development (Mouvement pour le renouveau <br />
démocratique et le développement, MRD) and director of its newspaper, <br />
Djibouti Renewal (Le Renouveau djiboutien).<br />
<br />
He was detained in March 2003 on account of an article he published, <br />
summarily convicted the next day for &quot;undermining army morale&quot; and <br />
&quot;publishing false information&quot;. He was given a six-month prison sentence <br />
and fine. The following month he received a second six-month suspended <br />
sentence, which was reduced on appeal.<br />
<br />
Days later, he was re-arrested on the basis of a complaint by the army&#039;s <br />
Chief of Staff. He was detained for over a month before being granted bail, <br />
rearrested two days later, and tried and acquitted on 23 June. The <br />
acquittal was reversed on 9 July when Daher Ahmed Farah was returned to prison.<br />

ERITREA<br />
<br />
Voice of America correspondent arrested<br />
<br />
Reporters Without Borders today condemned the arrest and conscription into the<br />
Eritrean army of the local correspondent of the radio station Voice of America<br />
(VOA) and called for the immediate release of him and 18 other jailed media<br />
workers in the country, which it said was &quot;Africa&#039;s biggest prison for<br />
journalists.&quot;<br />
<br />
The journalist, Akhilu Solomon, 32, was arrested at his home on 8 July and taken<br />
to an army camp to do his compulsory military service. However, VOA said he had<br />
already done part of it and been exempted from the rest on medical grounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;After persecuting the local media, the government is now going after those<br />
working for foreign media,&quot; said Reporters Without Borders secretary-general<br />
Robert Ménard. &quot;The latest arrest means 19 journalists are now in prison, making<br />
Eritrea by far the most repressive country in Africa in this respect.&quot;<br />
<br />
The government shut down all privately-owned newspapers in September 2001 and<br />
arrested several journalists, leaving only the official press operating. Three<br />
foreign media - the BBC, Agence France-Presse and Deutsche Welle - have<br />
stringers in the country. The US embassy in Asmara said it had contacted the<br />
government about Solomon&#039;s arrest.<br />
<br />
All Eritreans over 18 have been obliged since 1994 to do 18 months military<br />
service, including six months training at a military camp in the western town of<br />
Sawa.<br />

Le correspondant de VOA arrêté<br />
<br />
Le correspondant en Erythrée de la radio américaine Voice of America (VOA) a été<br />
arrêté par la police et conduit dans un camp militaire pour faire son service<br />
national.<br />
<br />
Reporters sans frontières demande sa libération et rappelle que l&#039;Erythrée est<br />
la plus grande prison du continent africain pour les journalistes. Avec cette<br />
nouvelle arrestation, cela porte à dix-neuf le nombre de journalistes<br />
emprisonnés dans le pays. &quot;Après s&#039;en être prises à la presse locale, les<br />
autorités se tournent maintenant vers les correspondants de la presse étrangère.<br />
L&#039;Erythrée est, de loin, le pays le plus répressif du continent en matière de<br />
liberté de la presse&quot;, a écrit Reporters sans frontières dans un communiqué. En<br />
septembre 2001, les autorités avaient suspendu tous les journaux privés et<br />
arrêté plusieurs journalistes. Aujourd&#039;hui, seule la presse officielle continue<br />
d&#039;exister.<br />
<br />
Akhlilu Solomon, 32 ans, correspondant local de VOA, a été interpellé à son<br />
domicile le 8 juillet. Des officiels ont ensuite annoncé qu&#039;il avait été conduit<br />
dans un camp militaire pour faire son service national obligatoire. Selon VOA,<br />
le journaliste avait déjà effectué une partie de son service national et était<br />
exempté de la suite pour raisons médicales. L&#039;ambassade des Etats-Unis à Asmara<br />
a affirmé avoir pris contact avec le gouvernement érythréen à ce sujet.<br />
<br />
Trois médias étrangers disposent désormais de correspondants dans le pays : la<br />
BBC, l&#039;AFP et la Deutsche Welle.<br />
<br />
Depuis 1994, tous les Erythréens de plus de dix-huit ans sont obligés<br />
d&#039;accomplir un service national de dix-huit mois, dont six de formation dans un<br />
camp militaire, à Sawa, dans l&#039;ouest du pays.<br />

photojournalist with &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper, by youths belonging to Muluzi&#039;s<br />
ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) party. The incident took place on 7<br />
July 2003, at the opening of the UDF mini-convention in Blantyre. In the<br />
statement, President Muluzi avoided the issue, claiming that &quot;opposition<br />
elements&quot; assaulted the photojournalist. &quot;The incident was very unfortunate<br />
and was definitely carried out by people who were assigned by enemies of the<br />
ruling party,&quot; he said. Ironically, President Muluzi pledged to ensure the<br />
protection of journalists as the nation prepares for general elections in<br />
2004.<br />
<br />
Denis Mzembe, chairperson of MISA&#039;s Malawi chapter (NAMISA), dismissed the<br />
president&#039;s statement as unacceptable. &quot;We do not see any commitment at all.<br />
There is no way Mr. Muluzi can say that these were not UDF members,&quot; Mzembe<br />
said.<br />
<br />
In an interview, UDF Deputy Publicity Secretary and Presidential Affairs<br />
Minister Ken Lipenga said Nyirenda was a victim of a &quot;conspiracy philosophy&quot;<br />
within the party. &quot;We must admit that there are some people within the party<br />
that, for reasons best known to themselves, wanted to sabotage the<br />
convention,&quot; said Lipenga, who is a former editor-in-chief of &quot;The Nation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Alfred Ntonga, current editor-in-chief of &quot;The Nation&quot;, also dismissed<br />
President Muluzi&#039;s statement, describing it as &quot;business as usual.&quot; &quot;He has<br />
made similar statements before. In the past, he even ordered the inspector<br />
general [of police] to arrest such people, but acts of violence continue to<br />
happen,&quot; said Ntonga.<br />
<br />
BACKGROUND:<br />
Nyirenda was beaten up by UDF youth wing members, who stole his two cameras<br />
and a cell phone. UDF youths are on record as having torched vehicles<br />
belonging to opposition leaders and harassed journalists and opposition<br />
politicians, but no arrests have been made. Police are still investigating<br />
cases that date back as far as five years.<br />

PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE ON MEDIA AND PEACE IN WEST AFRICA<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
The Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) and the International Media Support  (IMS) of Copenhagen, in collaboration with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and UNESCO, held a three-day regional Media and Peace programme planning meeting in Accra, Ghana, from July 8 &#x2013; 10, 2003.  The meeting examined the current situation, role and fate of the media within the context of the protracted civil strifes and violent conflicts that, directly or indirectly, afflict all of the countries in West Africa today.  The meeting also reviewed initiatives and programmes that exist in the region, and proposed new directions and strategies for a regional programme for improving the capacity and role of the media to promote peace.<br />
<br />
The meeting was attended by 26 representatives of 19 national, regional and international media and human rights organizations.  The diverse backgrounds and experiences of participants enabled the deliberations of the meeting to be informed by the different situational needs and realities, and provided the basis for a number of decisions and recommendations for short-, medium- and long-term interventions.  <br />
<br />
The other organisations participating in the meeting included:<br />
	The Media Rights Agenda, Lagos;<br />
	The Panos Institute West Africa, Dakar;<br />
The Press Union of Liberia;<br />
The Sierra Leone Association of Journalists;<br />
The Guinea Association of Independent Press Editors, Conakry;<br />
The Association of Journalists for Peace in Cote d&#x2019;Ivoire;<br />
The National Press Commission, Abidjan;<br />
The Media Ethics Observatory of Cote d&#x2019;Ivoire;<br />
The Media Action International, Geneva;<br />
The International Federation of Journalists, Brussels.<br />
<br />
Issues:<br />
	Among the broad issues discussed include:<br />
·	The needs and challenges imposed by the evolving conflicts call for the collaborative commitment of organisations active in the region working on media and peace; the mobilisation and deployment of intervention strategies along a common, coordinated and comprehensive platform;<br />
·	Some conflict situations have abated or ended (e.g., Sierra Leone); some are sporadic or occasional (e.g., Nigeria).  But the raging conflict situations in Liberia and Cote d&#x2019;Ivoire require urgent and particular attention. Therefore, although intervention strategies must have wider regional implications and applicability, Liberia and Cote d&#x2019;Ivoire deserve focussed attention; <br />
·	Programmes of intervention and support must be based on an appreciation and acknowledgment of the potential of national and regional media institutions, as well as the rights and obligations of journalists, to promote peace and help reduce the conditions for violent conflict;<br />
·	While maintaining and encouraging the particular initiatives of individual organizations, to define clearly areas and strategies for common actions and coordination;<br />
·	Encouragement of and determination of strategies and program of collaboration with UN agencies in peace building programmes;<br />
·	Strategies for fundraising; definition of roles; plans for managing the collaborative processes without instituting new and unnecessary organisational structures.<br />
<br />
Needs and recommendations:<br />
Among the needs identified for both short- and long- term interventions are:<br />
Short-term:<br />
·	The general protection, safety and rehabilitation of traumatised and war-affected journalists;<br />
·	Media infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity-building (through training workshops and seminars as well as institutional strengthening support systems);<br />
·	Mechanism for safe havens for journalists fleeing reprisals;<br />
·	Empowerment and capacity-building:(through logistic support and provision of basic functional equipment; including recorders, tapes; mobile phones, laptops, stationery, etc);  <br />
·	Training and workshops for journalists in improved coverage of peace building, national reconciliation, the transitional processes, and elections coverage;<br />
<br />
Medium-to-long-term:<br />
Medium and medium-to-long term needs of the media in the conflict zones and the sub-region generally include:<br />
·	Continuous training and orientation programmes for journalists on how to cover conflict situations and promote peace; <br />
·	Development of safe havens and legal defence funds for media practitioners and journalist victims of war and/or other violent political conflicts; <br />
·	Baseline needs assessment studies to identify practical needs and recommend intervention strategies;<br />
·	Legislative and institutional reforms to promote media freedom and independence as a necessary condition for efficient media coverage for peace;<br />
·	Encouraging media pluralism through legislative reform, institutional rehabilitation and capacity building of media enterprises;<br />
·	Mid-career training support for journalists (in professional ethics, human rights and investigative reporting) and editors and proprietors (in the development of media as professional and independent enterprises).<br />
<br />
The MFWA and the IMS are working to complete the draft of the envisaged proposal document for the regional programme on Media and Peace.  The final document, to be approved by all the participants, will be a basis for the UN agencies to develop their policies and programs for Media and Peace making in the region. <br />

Broadcasting authority selling the public a dummy<br />
<br />
By Sizani Weza<br />
<br />
The outreach campaign being conducted by the Broadcasting Authority of<br />
Zimbabwe (BAZ) represents yet another attempt by the authorities to<br />
frustrate aspiring broadcasters through delays. The questionnaire&#039;s results<br />
are obvious-they will either justify ZBC&#039;s unfair monopoly in the sector or<br />
give good reason for the need for an alternative government run broadcaster.<br />
<br />
The endless planning conducted by the authorities through BAZ and the<br />
Department of Information and Publicity has been done at the expense of<br />
truly liberalizing the airwaves. This is what the public expected after<br />
Capital Radio&#039;s successful court challenge on ZBC&#039;s monopoly on the airwaves<br />
in 2000.<br />
<br />
The most nauseating aspect about the BAZ survey is that it is the second<br />
similar survey being conducted by the same institution within two years. The<br />
first survey, which consisted of open-ended questions, had a deadline of<br />
31st August 2001. Neither the frequency allotment plans nor new players in<br />
the broadcasting arena were realized after its conclusion. Instead, the past<br />
two years have seen the shutting down of the only alternative broadcaster,<br />
Joy Television, in the broadcasting sector and an increasing intimidation of<br />
aspiring and existing independent broadcasters through bombing, harassment<br />
of their workers and threats.<br />
<br />
The latest survey, whose deadline is 5th September 2003, comes hardly a<br />
month after the Minster of Information and Publicity in the Office of the<br />
President and Cabinet promised Zimbabweans that administrative policies and<br />
technical instruments for licensing new players would be put in place before<br />
the end of July. Given the survey would be used for determining the<br />
frequency allotment plan, it means that these technicalities are not<br />
possible before September. If experience from the previous survey is<br />
anything to go by, then Zimbabweans may as well wait for two more years for<br />
new players to enter the sector.<br />
<br />
In terms of the BSA, the BAZ is the sole manager of the frequency spectrum<br />
of Zimbabwe, and the licensing and regulatory authority for all broadcasting<br />
services of Zimbabwe. It plays an advisory role to the Minister who is the<br />
final licensing authority. This arrangement renders the whole management of<br />
the frequency spectrum prone to political interference and cannot be<br />
described as democratic.<br />
<br />
The BAZ has argued in the past that it intends to use the surveys to<br />
determine frequency allotment and licence area plans. Any responsible<br />
Government truly committed to the liberalization of the airwaves should have<br />
engaged in this process soon after the colonial era. The 1957 Broadcasting<br />
Act, drafted by a Government that did not want alternative players in the<br />
scene, protected ZBC&#039;s monopoly. The Zanu PF government kept this<br />
legislation for the same purpose, if not worse. Its successor, the<br />
Broadcasting Service Act (Chapter 2:06), has failed to stamp out the<br />
objectives of the colonial law.<br />
<br />
The questionnaire circulated for the purpose of determining the frequency<br />
allotment plans gives away the intentions of those conducting the survey.<br />
These include the efforts to undermine short-wave broadcasts through<br />
limiting the number of options for frequency bands accessed by the public.<br />
<br />
Questions such as &quot;to what extent do available radio/television stations<br />
support the promotion of Zimbabwean arts and cultural values&quot; will give a<br />
distorted picture of the existing situation, which has led to the<br />
exploitation of independent film producers and musicians. Media consumers<br />
may watch programmes from local independent producers on television. But the<br />
fact that they are not paid adequate royalties to eke a living out of their<br />
work is obscure to them.<br />
The question can best be addressed to local independent producers who are<br />
important stakeholders in the broadcasting industry the BAZ purports to<br />
regulate. It is noteworthy that this category has been ignored in the<br />
questionnaire, which is conspicuous for its agrarian orientation- it lists<br />
three categories of farmers as options, that is, farmer, full time farmer<br />
and part time farmer (question 19).<br />
The resultant distortions may deny the public additional radio and<br />
television stations on the basis of fostering of Zimbabwean national<br />
identity and values (Section 3.3.j of the BSA).<br />
<br />
And does the BAZ necessarily need the opinion of viewers and listeners to<br />
determine whether certain radio frequencies are received in certain areas or<br />
not? Surely, Transmedia Private Limited should know the capacities of their<br />
transmission equipment and can provide this information to the BAZ.<br />
Similarly, the Posts and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (POTRAZ)<br />
should by now have informed the BAZ of the available bands in the frequency<br />
spectrum it regulates. This is purely technical work that can be resolved<br />
before consultations with the public.<br />
<br />
Transmedia, a signal carrier service provider that is the sole transmitter<br />
for all broadcasters in the country, has not made public its proposed<br />
solution to the information drought experienced by Zimbabweans in other<br />
parts of the country such as Hwange and Chimanimani who have reported<br />
difficulties accessing local television and radio transmission. The only<br />
consolation for these people is that they are spared from the daily tidal<br />
wave of Rambai makashinga jingles, Jonathan Moyo&#039;s latest propaganda<br />
campaign.<br />
At one time, Hwange residents petitioned the ZBC over poor reception of FM<br />
frequencies in the area. Transmedia was tasked with managing the<br />
broadcasting frequencies and ensuring that Zimbabweans, wherever they are,<br />
access local radio and television. The only development the company has<br />
publicly announced is its acquisition of shares in Multi-Choice. Far too few<br />
Zimbabweans have access to DSTV. Why go for projects that will benefit few<br />
people leaving most Zimbabweans starved of information?<br />
<br />
What Zimbabweans need is their right to choose an alternative to ZBC on the<br />
FM band. This certainly cannot be achieved through endless planning, but<br />
through licensing of new players in both radio and television broadcasting.<br />
Even more, is the desire to have a broadcasting station that will present<br />
more balanced news and current affairs than the politically-soiled content<br />
of ZBC&#039;s programmes.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the public can take advantage of the BAZ outreach and survey to<br />
demonstrate their desires for a truly liberalized broadcasting sector.<br />
Public action can range from simple letters of demand accompanying the<br />
flawed questionnaires to public protests during the BAZ outreach meetings.<br />
Although the BAZ may not be the appropriate to take up such submissions,<br />
this will put pressure on Government to consider its policy position on the<br />
liberalization of the broadcasting sector. But above all, it will make sure<br />
that the BAZ does not sell the public another dummy as happened in 2001.<br />

1. General comment <br />
<br />
MMPZ notes with concern the manner in which journalists controlling Zimbabwe&#x2019;s media have apparently normalized the grinding socio-economic hardships in the country to the extent that they no longer consider these stories of great news value. As a result, investigative news about the real effects of inflation on the public; transport problems; the alarming collapse of the health delivery system; and rampant corruption in all sectors of Zimbabwean society have either been given scant attention or ignored altogether. <br />
For example, besides The Financial Gazette and The Daily News (3/7) no other media reported that 43 people had died in Bulawayo between April and May this year because of malnutrition. Even then, the two papers merely reported the Bulawayo City Council&#x2019;s health report revealing this disturbing piece of news and to make matters worse treated it as a minor incident on their inside pages. If this sort of thing is happening in Zimbabwe&#x2019;s second city, what is happening in the rest of the country &#x2013; and even in the capital itself? Why have we not heard about the hard facts of starvation nationwide? What is the real inflation rate for the average family? And why has the media made no apparent effort to seek, independently, these indices of decline and collapse? Where is the human perspective of the crisis afflicting this country? In such a tragic economic and social climate, it is extraordinary that the media wait for official statements on such calamities as deaths from starvation; in this case mostly children. It seems the details will not emerge regarding the scale of suffering by the Zimbabwean nation unless it is delivered into the hands of the media &#x2013; the private Press included. <br />
<br />
The media&#x2019;s preoccupation with political stories at the expense of investigative reports on the socio-economic crisis during the week under review was well illustrated by the placement by The Daily News of a speculative political feature article, Is Mbeki buying time for Mugabe&#x2019;s embattled regime? on its prime news page, page three, while the hard news story of starvation in Binga was buried on page seven. <br />
<br />
But if the Press&#x2019; coverage of the socio-economic crises afflicting Zimbabweans was questionable, ZBC&#x2019;s reporting of these issues was deplorable. Its coverage demonstrated a woeful failure to fulfill its duty of providing news, giving incisive commentary and analysis of the extent in the decline of the living standards of the public. For example, amidst fuel, cash and commodity shortages in an environment characterized by hyperinflation officially pegged at over 300 percent, ZTV preferred allocating one hour 34 minutes and 50 seconds or 44 percent of the total time (excluding business, weather and sport segments) allocated to its 8pm main news bulletins to the national soccer team&#x2019;s campaign for a slot in the Africa Cup of Nations tournament scheduled for Tunisia next year. In addition, ZTV&#x2019;s 30-minute long Behind the Camera and its one-hour long Face the nation programmes were devoted to soccer. A song composed by Information Minister Jonathan Moyo for the team was also allocated time within ZTV&#x2019;s 8pm bulletins before and a day after the match. In fact, the song, Go Warriors, was incessantly played on all ZBC stations, and even eclipsed the saturation airing of the government&#x2019;s land reform programme jingle, Rambai Makashinga. <br />
While some newspapers described this as putting politics aside to follow something the public could cheer about, MMPZ would say this government-led campaign for the national football team was more a case of politicians interfering in the sports arena in order to distract the public from the hardships inflicted by a government bereft of ideas about restoring the economic prosperity of the country.  <br />
<br />
<br />
2. Crisis overwhelms media <br />
<br />
THE media&#x2019;s obsession with political rivalry between ZANU-PF and the MDC appears to have resulted in other fundamental issues, such as the country&#x2019;s deteriorating socio-economic crisis receiving superficial attention. Nowhere was this more evident than in coverage of the current transport problems and cash shortages. The private media were the main culprits. For example, they lacked clear information on how the recently introduced fuel coupon system for commuter transport, ostensibly to stop leakages of fuel to the black market, would be implemented. Neither did they discuss the practicability of such a move by government. <br />
<br />
Although the government-controlled media faired better, with regard to information on where to access the coupons and the necessary documents required for one to get coupons (The Herald and ZTV 2/7, 7am), they generally reported the socio-economic problems in isolation of the country&#x2019;s general economic collapse, and indeed, how Zimbabweans are coping with it. For example, ZTV (1/07, 7am) merely announced that the Rural Passenger Transport Organization had hiked its fares for &#x201C;rural and long distance&#x201D; journeys &#x201C;by at least 33% with effect from today&#x201D; due to viability problems. ZTV provided no analysis of the effects of the fare increases on the public nor explain whether such a move would help alleviate transport shortages. Instead, the station (2/07, 6pm) trivialized the commuter transport problem and presented it as if it was an issue confined to three Harare suburbs. It reported that residents of Budiriro, Glen View and Mufakose had called on government &#x201C;to introduce a weekend commuter train service to ease transport problems being experienced in the areas&#x201D;. Although the report noted that the transport situation had worsened &#x201C;due to the continued fuel shortage&#x201D; and that some operators had been &#x201C;forced to withdraw vehicles from the roads after failing to secure foreign currency to import spare parts&#x201D;, ZBC failed to go beyond such simplistic statements to explain the gravity of the situation in the country in general. <br />
The Herald (2/7 &amp; 3/7) however, gave a different explanation to the transport blues. It pointed out that most commuter transport operators had pulled out because about three-quarters of them did not have the requisite papers needed to acquire fuel coupons. <br />
The Daily News (3/7) put the figure at 60 percent but attributed the reduction in the number of commuter transport vehicles to high operational costs and exorbitant fuel prices on the black market. It further reported that the few operators who remained on the road had taken advantage of the situation and had increased their fares by 150 percent in Harare and Bulawayo. The Herald (3/7) concurred saying commuter fares had been increased to between $500 and $1000. <br />
However, both papers failed to translate their percentages of vehicles now out of commission in actual figures. Nor has any section of the media attempted to establish how commuter operators arrive at the fares they set and compare them with an independent assessment of running costs. <br />
The Manica Post (4/7) revealed that the problem was not only confined to the two major cities but &#x2013; not surprisingly &#x2013; to Mutare as well.  It reported that a new fuel arrangement where buses are required to queue for fuel at designated service stations during peak hours had left commuters stranded in that city. Reportedly, the problem was compounded by a blitz on the omnibuses by the Vehicle Inspection Department (VID), which was impounding and penalizing &#x201C;unroadworthy&#x201D; vehicles. The paper noted that 75 percent of public vehicles in Mutare do not have certificates of fitness or route permits. Like the two dailies, the paper did not explain what 75 percent represented in figures. <br />
<br />
Despite their tenacity in pin-pointing some of the causes of the transport crisis, the government-controlled media in general, failed to question government&#x2019;s stop-gap measures to solve the fuel shortages and the resultant transport crisis. Rather, The Herald (3/7) tried to blame the multinational oil companies for the fuel shortage, saying they had yet to import fuel in response to government&#x2019;s deregulation of the fuel procurement sector. Also, the paper (2/7) attempted to give Zimbabweans some false sense of hope saying fuel supplies would resume in the &#x201C;near future following the reviving of a trade deal between Zimbabwe and Libya,&#x201D; without clarifying when exactly supplies would arrive and how long they would last. This sense of hope evaporated when The Daily News (6/7) revealed that President Robert Mugabe had only managed to secure US$30 million worth of fuel from Libya, an amount that would last the country a mere three weeks. <br />
<br />
The long fuel queues were by no means the only queues that dotted the country as Zimbabwe&#x2019;s fast dwindling workforce continued to struggle at the banks to convert a portion of the salaries into cash. All the media reported the issue and for once agreed that the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s decision to print $4billion dollars worth of bank notes was not the solution. The Chronicle and The Herald  (1/7) observed that although the injection was welcome, they urged the central bank to guarantee a steady money supply by printing more notes of higher denominations. However, they remained blind to the underlying implications of such a move on the country&#x2019;s inflation. <br />
Studio 7 (30/06) quoted economic analyst, Tony Hawkins, as saying more efforts were needed to alleviate the shortages and &#x201C;not just printing bank notes&#x201D; adding that the move, among other issues, would fuel inflation to &#x201C;500% by December&#x201D;. Similarly, The Financial Gazette (3/7) columnist, Witness Chinyama, pointed out that Zimbabwe was already at the &#x201C;stagflation&#x201D; stage and warned that the cash injections without other measures to resuscitate the economy would only fan inflation. The Sunday News (6/7) made similar observations and called on the central bank to &#x201C;tackle inflation firstto satisfy the demand for cash&#x201D;.  <br />
<br />
<br />
3. Bush safari enrages government media  <br />
<br />
Regional and international efforts to resolve Zimbabwe&#x2019;s worsening economic and political crises assumed greater prominence in the media as the scheduled visit to Africa by US President George Bush, particularly to South Africa, drew closer. In a typical replay of the previous week, the government-controlled media dismissed the trip as insignificant and narrowly interpreted the US&#x2019;s calls for the restoration of democracy and the formation of a transitional government in Zimbabwe to mean that Bush&#x2019;s visit was a neo-colonial expedition to oust President Mugabe from power. <br />
The private media was less emotional in their coverage. Although they welcomed and apparently celebrated Bush&#x2019;s stance on Zimbabwe, they also tried to analyze whether he would be able to successfully sell his approach to his South African counterpart Thabo Mbeki. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the week, ZBC (1/07,8pm) reported that, &#x201C;Some of Zimbabwe&#x2019;s neighbours have refused to be used as launch pads for the US and Britain&#x2019;s plans to effect regime change in Zimbabwe&#x201D;. Zambia and Botswana were named as the two neighbours that had refused to cooperate with the US but there was no official comment from the two countries. In the same report, the government-controlled broadcaster echoed Mugabe&#x2019;s earlier unsubstantiated allegations that the US and Britain had helped to fund the MDC mass stayaways and that they were lobbying &#x201C;Zimbabwe&#x2019;s neighbours, especially South Africa, SADC member states and the African continent  to isolate Zimbabwe on the international scene and put pressure on the government for the removal of President Robert Mugabe &#x201D;. <br />
This myopic view of Bush&#x2019;s visit resulted in the government-controlled media delivering vitriolic and racist attacks against the US leadership. The Herald (1 &amp; 2/7) is a case in point. The paper carried two opinion pieces attacking the US State Secretary, Colin Powell, for his call to restore democracy in Zimbabwe with fresh internationally supervised elections via a transitional government. In its article on July 2nd, the paper castigated Powell for allegedly having &#x201C;chosen money and conservative political thinking over his black history&#x201D; and wanting Zimbabweans to do the same.  The paper&#x2019;s relentless racial slurs were also repeated in its article (5/7), Zimbabwe does not need a transitional government. Not to be outdone, The Sunday Mail&#x2019;s Munyaradzi Huni (6/7) described Bush as a &#x201C;Texan gunslinger&#x201D; who &#x201C;stole&#x201D; the American presidential election, and accused him of &#x201C;dangling the carrot in billions of American dollars to buy out the African leaders so that they can allow him to spread his stinking imperialistic wings&#x201D;.  Huni then observed - without a shred of evidence - that Bush had cancelled his trip early this year and rescheduled it so that it coincided with the African Union summit in Mozambique in order &#x201C;to whip them (African leaders) into line using one stick.&#x201D;  <br />
<br />
Besides introducing a racist angle to Bush&#x2019;s trip, the government-controlled media tried to downplay the significance of his visit following Mugabe&#x2019;s address during the 54th Session of the ZANU-PF Central Committee. ZBC (3/07, 8pm) quoted him as saying, &#x201C;When Bush visits here, it shouldn&#x2019;t send tremors to your spines [because] Africa is united with us in opposing them&#x201D;.  There was no effort to investigate why Mugabe had to calm the nerves of his colleagues if Bush&#x2019;s visit was indeed a non-event. Neither did The Herald or Chronicle (4/7) explore this in their report of the same event. As if taking a cue from Mugabe&#x2019;s speech, The Sunday News (6/7), Bush&#x2019;s Africa tour bound to fail - analysts, quoted government-controlled media&#x2019;s favourite analysts dismissing Bush&#x2019;s tour. <br />
<br />
The private media avoided personal attacks on either government or US authorities and instead examined the US and South African approaches to the Zimbabwean crisis. For example, while The Standard (6/7) comment, Bush visit: What&#x2019;s in it for Zimbabwe?, agreed with the Bush Administration that Zimbabwe needed a return to democracy but was opposed to the US calls for &#x2018;regime change&#x2019; wherever it desired. &#x201C;Our advice to the US is that acting in this high-handed manner can only alienate people and needlessly lose the goodwill of its friends in Africa. Powell&#x2019;s dramatic language ran the risk of being interpreted as war-mongering and parallels being drawn with the Iraq war,&#x201D; it stated. The Daily News (3/7) pointed out that despite the US&#x2019;s call to Thabo Mbeki to take a more proactive role on Zimbabwe, the South African President was unlikely to change his approach. It quoted Mbeki as saying, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s incorrect really to be saying that we should stand outside the borders of Zimbabwe and decide what the Zimbabweans should do about their own country.&#x201D;  <br />
<br />
In fact, ZBC (3/07, 7am) conveniently used Mbeki&#x2019;s statements to buttress the impression that Mbeki and African leaders were behind Zimbabwe. However, while ZBC viewed Mbeki&#x2019;s comments as a positive development, The Daily News (4/7) did not. In its article, Is Mbeki buying time for Mugabe&#x2019;s embattled regime? the paper charged that Mbeki had become an obstacle in efforts to force Mugabe to relinquish power. MDC secretary-general Welshman Ncube also criticized South Africa&#x2019;s stance on Zimbabwe saying it reflected that country&#x2019;s diplomatic immaturity, Sunday Mirror (6/7). <br />
<br />
While the government-controlled media generally gave the impression that South Africa would not relent in its apparently sympathetic stance on Zimbabwe, The Daily News (1/7) and Studio 7 (2/7) revealed that it was willing to discuss with the US and reach common ground on how to deal with Zimbabwe. They both quoted a South African official, Aziz Pahad, as having said South Africa wanted more clarity on American plans to bankroll the economic revival of Zimbabwe once Mugabe stepped down. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Studio 7 (2/7), The Zimbabwe Independent (4/7), The Standard (6/7), The Daily News on Sunday (6/7) and Sunday Mirror (6/7) reported that the MDC would send delegations to South Africa and Mozambique to lobby Bush and African leaders respectively, to pressure ZANU PF to engage the opposition in dialogue. The government-controlled media ignored the news, although that did not stop the Sunday News (6/7) maligning the MDC as &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; and &#x201C;puppets of imperialism,&#x201D; for wanting to meet Bush.<br />

&gt;<br />
&gt;  Nigerian civil society groups have called for a review of United States<br />
&gt; government&#039;s foreign and oil policy.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The environmental and human rights groups in an open letter to the<br />
visiting<br />
&gt; United States President, Mr. George Bush, said America&#039;s foreign and oil<br />
&gt; policy currently serve only the interest of powerful corporations. The<br />
&gt; groups specifically opposed plan by the US to deploy troops to guard<br />
&gt; Nigerian oil installations.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; They lamented that for four decades Western oil companies operating in<br />
&gt; Nigeria have reduced the once balanced and life-sustaining Niger Delta to<br />
a<br />
&gt; veritable nightmare.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;The corporations have been flaring death-dispensing gas into the<br />
atmosphere<br />
&gt; of local communities, mangling fishing waters and farmlands with oil from<br />
&gt; old and broken pipelines they have refused to maintain and repair, cutting<br />
&gt; down forests and abolishing fresh water sources&quot;, the groups observed. &quot;We<br />
&gt; have seen them march alongside Nigerian soldiers they pay with blood<br />
money,<br />
&gt; into villages and hamlets killing, maiming and raping young men and women<br />
&gt; whose only crime is that they dared raise their voice to protest the<br />
wanton<br />
&gt; destruction of their lives and sources of livelihood&quot;.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The petitioners pointed out that the resolution of the Niger Delta crisis<br />
&gt; can neither be found in militarism nor legalism but in political dialogue<br />
&gt; with the local people who matter the most.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The environmental and human rights groups similarly called on the US<br />
&gt; government to:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; . rethink its oil and foreign policy because it is driven by<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; the interests of  powerful corporations;<br />
&gt; . stop playing politics with hunger and promoting<br />

&gt;<br />
&gt; DEAR PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; You are visiting our country at a time of profound economic and political<br />
&gt; crises. The neo-conservative agenda which you so powerfully represent,<br />
&gt; putting profits before living people, is wasting lives, aborting liberties<br />
&gt; and destroying livelihoods.<br />
&gt; For four decades and more, we have watched the Western oil companies<br />
&gt; operating in our country reduce the once ecologically-balanced and<br />
&gt; life-sustaining Niger Delta to a veritable nightmare, flaring<br />
&gt; death-dispensing gas into the atmosphere of local communities, mangling<br />
&gt; fishing waters and farmlands with oil from old and broken pipelines they<br />
&gt; have refused to maintain and repair, cutting down forests and abolishing<br />
&gt; fresh water sources. We have seen them march alongside Nigerian soldiers<br />
&gt; they pay with blood money, into  villages and hamlets killing, maiming and<br />
&gt; raping young men and women whose only crime is that they dared raise their<br />
&gt; voice to protest the wanton destruction of their lives and sources of<br />
&gt; livelihood. When people and their habitat die, Mr. President, the world<br />
dies<br />
&gt; too.<br />
&gt; We would like to state our total opposition to your plan to further<br />
&gt; militarise Africa by setting up new military bases in Ghana, Senegal,<br />
Mali,<br />
&gt; Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome and Principe and Kenya as well as expanding<br />
&gt; America military presence in Djibouti. Reports in the international media,<br />
&gt; including the Wall Street Journal and The Guardian of London say the<br />
target<br />
&gt; of this massive military<br />
&gt; deployment is to protect oil fields in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. We<br />
insist<br />
&gt; that the resolution of the Niger Delta crisis can neither be found in<br />
&gt; militarism nor legalism but in political dialogue with the local people<br />
who<br />
&gt; matter the most.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; We call on the US government to:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; . rethink its oil and foreign policy because it is driven by<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; the interests of  powerful corporations;<br />
&gt; . stop playing politics with hunger and promoting<br />

Nigeria has pledged to send 750 soldiers for the operation.

Sudan : Empty promises - human rights violations in government-controlled<br />
areas<br />
<br />
<br />
As Sudanese mark the first anniversary of the signing of the Machakos<br />
Protocol, which paved the way for the current peace process, Amnesty<br />
International is calling for human rights to be made a full component of<br />
any forthcoming peace agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless human rights for all become a full component of a forthcoming<br />
agreement crucial for the future of Sudan, peace will not be sustainable,&quot;<br />
Amnesty International said today in a new report entitled Sudan: Empty<br />
promises? Human rights violations in government-controlled areas (full<br />
report online at <a href="http://amnesty-news.c.tclk.net/maabgaKaaZekHbb0iygb/">http://amnesty-news.c.tclk.net/maabgaKaaZekHbb0iygb/</a> ).<br />
<br />
The report, earlier submitted as a Memorandum to the government, details<br />
the continuing human rights violations committed by the Sudanese security<br />
forces in areas outside the south.<br />
<br />
&quot;While the world&#039;s attention has focused on supporting initiatives to end<br />
the conflict between the government and the armed opposition Sudan<br />
People&#039;s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), people in<br />
government-controlled areas continue to suffer violations of their human<br />
rights, rooted in the same issues of discrimination and injustice that<br />
fuelled the war in the south.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The government of Sudan has made many gestures hinting at greater<br />
openness and promotion of human rights in areas it controls. But too often<br />
positive rhetoric has not been converted into concrete action in favour of<br />
human rights,&quot; Amnesty International said.<br />
<br />
An emerging conflict in Darfur, western Sudan, where a group of sedentary<br />
farmers took up arms against the government in February 2003 because of<br />
what they perceive as the lack of government protection of their people<br />
and the marginalisation of the region, further illustrates the effects of<br />
the government&#039;s willingness to violate human rights when facing problems.<br />
<br />
Darfur has been the scene of attacks by armed groups on sedentary people<br />
and the government has reacted to the situation by detaining incommunicado<br />
community leaders and perceived government critics. In 2001, it<br />
established Special Courts in Darfur to deal with murders, armed attacks<br />
and banditry. These courts have handed down death sentences and cruel,<br />
inhuman and degrading punishments after grossly unfair trials.<br />
<br />
In other areas of Sudan, including in the capital Khartoum, incommunicado<br />
detention of political opponents, students and ordinary citizens as well<br />
as torture by the security forces remain common. Journalists are subjected<br />
to restrictions imposed by the security forces and civil society activists<br />
are routinely arrested, arbitrarily detained and harassed. Students and<br />
internally displaced persons have been injured or killed as a result of<br />
the use of excessive force by the police and security forces. Above all,<br />
the lack of judicial accountability of the security forces for any action<br />
they take, including acts of torture, is maintained in laws which are<br />
inconsistent with international human rights principles.<br />
<br />
&quot;While the focus is on the horrendous abuses committed by both sides of<br />
the armed conflict in the south, human rights violations committed by<br />
government forces in areas it controls are being ignored. The Sudanese<br />
government has failed to stop or investigate not only war-related abuses<br />
by its armed forces and allied militia groups in the south, but also<br />
abuses by its security forces outside the context of the conflict. This is<br />
why human rights violations in Sudan continue unabated,&quot; Amnesty<br />
International said.<br />
<br />
Amnesty International is urging the Sudanese government to implement its<br />
recommendations and now fulfil the promises it made to respect and protect<br />
international human rights law, in particular to:<br />
<br />
- abolish Articles 31 and 33 of the National Security Forces Act, which<br />
allow the security forces to detain people incommunicado without charge<br />
and give them immunity from prosecution;<br />
<br />
- abolish provisions of the Special and Specialized Criminal Courts in<br />
Darfur which contravene international standards of fairness;<br />
<br />
- end harsh restrictions by the security forces on the Sudanese press;<br />
<br />
- immediately stop arresting, detaining or harassing civil society<br />
activists, including political opponents, human rights defenders and<br />
women&#039;s rights activists;<br />
<br />
- investigate impartially and independently reports of killings and<br />
torture by the security forces and bring the suspected perpetrators to<br />
justice;<br />
<br />
- allow an independent and impartial Commission of Inquiry to investigate<br />
the worsening situation in Darfur and human rights monitors into the<br />
region.<br />
<br />
The organization calls on international mediators of the Sudan peace<br />
process, donor countries and other interested parties in the talks to put<br />
the human rights of all Sudanese at the core of their efforts.<br />
<br />
&quot;A final peace agreement should not only put an end to the war in the<br />
south, but also guarantee in law and in practice the basic human rights of<br />
all Sudanese people,&quot; Amnesty International said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Background<br />
<br />
The Machakos Protocol was signed on 20 July 2002 in Machakos, eastern<br />
Kenya, as a first step to end the 20-years old armed conflict in southern<br />
Sudan. Since then, peace talks between both parties to the conflict have<br />
continued, under the auspices of the regional body Inter-Governmental<br />
Authority on Development (IGAD) and international mediators - including<br />
Kenya, the United States, the United Kingdom and Norway.<br />
<br />
The mediators are hoping for a final agreement to be signed at the end of<br />
August 2003. Negotiations have been mainly about security, wealth-sharing<br />
and power-sharing arrangements; although human rights were mentioned in<br />
the Machakos Protocol, they are not addressed adequately in the peace<br />
talks. The situation outside the southern war zones of Sudan is not<br />
covered in the IGAD-sponsored peace process and civil society groups are<br />
not allowed at the negotiating table.<br />

&gt; What&#x2019;s the buzz with SchoolNet Africa<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; ***********************************************************<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; From Guns to Computers<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; As the first African led organization on ICTs in African education,  <br />
&gt; SchoolNet Africa believes that ICTs are tools to catalyse educational  <br />
&gt; opportunities for African youth and holds immense potential in meeting  <br />
&gt; Education for All objectives. This document outlines a pilot  <br />
&gt; initiative to introduce an ICT-enabled education program for child  <br />
&gt; ex-combatants in three African countries: Angola, Liberia and  <br />
&gt; Rwanda. The project seeks to establish an ICT multimedia and skill  <br />
&gt; training centre for child ex-combatants in three African cities in  <br />
&gt; Angola, Liberia and Rwanda.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Project Objectives<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; This project seeks to:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 1. Deploy multimedia computer access to child ex-combatants in  <br />
&gt; three citiesinAngola,LiberiaandRwanda;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 2. Provide computer skills to 100 child ex-combatants in each of  <br />
&gt; the three countries by the end of 2004;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 3. Provide psychological counselling programmes for the trained  <br />
&gt; child ex-combatants;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 4. Assist in the rehabilitation of child ex-combatants into main  <br />
&gt; stream society of family, education and job opportunities;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 5. Highlight implications for a national program on a larger scale.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Project Outputs and Outcomes<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; At the end of the one year period of the project<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; 1. Three cities ofAngola,LiberiaandRwandawould have been equipped  <br />
&gt; with 40 multimedia computer systems;<br />
&gt; 2. Over a hundred ex-child combatants would have been trained in  <br />
&gt; generic and technical computer skills;<br />
&gt; 3. 300 child ex-combatants in each of the countries would have been  <br />
&gt; trained and rehabilitated into main stream society;<br />
&gt; 4. A structure, network and equipment would have been available to the  <br />
&gt; three countries to train, counsel and rehabilitate other child  <br />
&gt; ex-combatants;<br />
&gt; 5. An evaluation report and mechanism would be available to replicate  <br />
&gt; the project in other countries.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Conclusion<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; As the issue of ex-child combatants continue to limit education for  <br />
&gt; all goals in Africa SchoolNet Africa calls on all stakeholders in  <br />
&gt; education inAngola,LiberiaandRwanda, non government organisations  <br />
&gt; (NGOs) and the international donor community to support this project.  <br />
&gt; combatants in other war-torn countries such asSierra  <br />
&gt; Leone,Burundi,Sudan,Somaliaand theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.It  <br />
&gt; is hoped that the success of this pilot project would lead to an  <br />
&gt; extension of education opportunities through ICTs for child  <br />
&gt; ex-combatants in other war-torn countries such asSierra  <br />
&gt; Leone,Burundi,Sudan,Somaliaand theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.<br />

&gt; SchoolNetAfrica ATN Exchange Program<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; SchoolNetMaliWestern CapeSchoolNetwork<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Inspired by the noble ideals of connecting African schools to  <br />
&gt; facilitate access to knowledge and experiences sharing among educators  <br />
&gt; and learners in order to enhance education inAfrica, schoolNetAfrica  <br />
&gt; initiate a teacher Exchange through its flagship program ATN(African  <br />
&gt; Teacher Network). The object was to give an opportunity to a schoolNet  <br />
&gt; Mali at its setting up phase to learn from Western cape school Network  <br />
&gt; which have more than ten years experiences in school Networking.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; In fact, from my arrival Monday the 6th May to my departureTuesday the  <br />
&gt; 13th May 2003I learnt how they are managing the network and acquired  <br />
&gt; some technical skills on computer network management. In addition I  <br />
&gt; had the privilege to take part to their committee meeting dealing with  <br />
&gt; the daily issues. I had also the opportunity to visit some of the  <br />
&gt; schools. In the different schools, I discussed with teachers and  <br />
&gt; computer lab managers about the challenges in ICTs use for educational  <br />
&gt; purposes and the actions they undertake to overcome those challenges.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Socially speaking they make me feel home and that remember me a saying  <br />
&gt; fromMali: &#x201C;wherever you go try to find a mother, father, brothers and  <br />
&gt; sisters&#x201D;.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; I did find all these in Western Cape Town Schools&#x2019; Network. Jenny king  <br />
&gt; as a mother introduced me to schools&#x2019; Networking life by both sharing  <br />
&gt; her experience with me and introducing me toWestern Capeschools  <br />
&gt; Network team<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Besides, I had the pleasure and the privilege to be accompanied by  <br />
&gt; Sibongile from SchoolNet SouthAfricato visitMukululiSchool, to  <br />
&gt; exchange with them about their success and challenges. I also  <br />
&gt; participate at a workshop facilitate by Reza Bardien and organize by  <br />
&gt; Direq learn on integrating Activate into School System. The courses  <br />
&gt; are broadcast by MindsetNetwork.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; As the way forward I suggest a strategic partnership between  <br />
&gt; SchoolNetAfrica andWestern CapeSchools&#x2019; Network in the setting of  <br />
&gt; Schools&#x2019;Network throughoutAfricabecause I think they are the right  <br />
&gt; partner and have the right skill especially with their Help Desk.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The lesson I draw from this exchange is the reinforcement of mybelieve  <br />
&gt; in hard work to go step by step but surely. In conclude I would like  <br />
&gt; to share with you this quote from Nelson Mandela, Madiba: &#x201C;Even the  <br />
&gt; most fantastic dream can becomes a reality if you are ready to face  <br />
&gt; the difficulties of life&#x201D;. Thanks toSchoolNetAfrica,Western  <br />

&gt; SchoolNetAfrica&#x2019;s Executive Director is Finalist for the 2003 World  <br />
&gt; Technology Awards<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The World Technology Network (WTN) announced today that MsShafika  <br />
&gt; Isaacs, Executive Director for SchoolNet Africa, has been selected as  <br />
&gt; a Finalist for the 2003 World Technology Award for Policy. The Awards  <br />
&gt; were presented by the WTN in association with Nasdaq, Accenture,  <br />
&gt; Microsoft, Genencor International, Dupont Textiles and Interiors, TIME  <br />
&gt; magazine, Technology Review magazine, Science magazine, and Business  <br />
&gt; 2.0 magazine. Selection as a finalist also means thatShafika  <br />
&gt; Isaacshas been elected as a Fellow of the World Technology Network.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The new Fellows were announced onJune 25, 2003inSan Francisco, at the  <br />
&gt; World Technology Awards gala ceremony in the conclusion of the World  <br />
&gt; Technology Summit. The World Technology Awards honour individuals and  <br />
&gt; corporations from twenty technology-related sectors selected by their  <br />
&gt; peers as being the innovators doing work of the greatest likely  <br />
&gt; long-term significance. Award categories range from biotechnology,  <br />
&gt; space and energy to ethics, design and entertainment.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Upon presentation of the Award, Ms Isaacs said:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;I am delighted to have been selected by my peers as a Finalist for  <br />
&gt; the 2003 World Technology Awards in the Policy. It is encouraging that  <br />
&gt; the WTN pays attention to ICT for Development Initiatives and realizes  <br />
&gt; the important enabling role that policy plays in this regard. I see  <br />
&gt; this award as an accolade for SchoolNet Africa who has really led the  <br />
&gt; awareness raising and advocacy process on the advantages of ICTs for  <br />
&gt; education inAfrica. Through exposure of this nature, Schoolnet  <br />
&gt; Africa&#x2019;s campaigns such as its call for 1 million computers for  <br />
&gt; African schools will make significant headway&#x201D;.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Nominees for the 2003 World Technology Awards were identified through  <br />
&gt; an intensive, global process in which current WTN members (primarily  <br />
&gt; winners and finalists of previous Awards cycles) made their  <br />
&gt; nominations and then voted their preferences based on who they think  <br />
&gt; are most innovative and impactful within their particular field.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; James P. Clark, founder and Chairman of the World Technology Network,  <br />
&gt; added:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &#x201D;The World Technology Awards program was created to recognize truly  <br />
&gt; extraordinary innovation on a global scale, the sort of work that  <br />
&gt; could be described as creating our collective future and changing our  <br />
&gt; world. Ms Isaacs and SchoolNet Africa&#x2019;s contribution in the field of  <br />
&gt; policy has been outstanding, and their selection as a new WTN Fellow  <br />
&gt; is public acknowledgement of that fact.&#x201D;<br />

&gt; ThinkQuestAfrica Internet Challenge Rules<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; ThinkQuestAfrica (TQA) Internet Challenge is the first regional  <br />
&gt; programme Internet contest managed by SchoolNet Africa to encourage  <br />
&gt; and support learners to form teams from different African countries.  <br />
&gt; It is a new style of learning that encourages learners to collaborate  <br />
&gt; across geographical borders to develop educational web sites.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; TQA is an annual African/international contest open to school  <br />
&gt; learners, aged 12-19. The purpose of the contest is to promote the  <br />
&gt; Internet Style of Learning - an interactive, participatory approach  <br />
&gt; that encourages learners to take advantage of the Internet as a source  <br />
&gt; of information and a powerful collaborative tool. Learners are  <br />
&gt; encouraged to work in teams of two or three - from different schools  <br />
&gt; and even different countries - to build web sites used as learning  <br />
&gt; tools by other learners.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Team Makeup and Eligibility<br />
&gt; In order to participate in the TQA, a learner must be a member of a  <br />
&gt; team. A team may consist of two, three or four learners, and one, or  <br />
&gt; two coaches. No more than one learner member may be living  <br />
&gt; outsideAfricaat the time of registration.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Learner members do not have to be the same age, be enrolled at the  <br />
&gt; same school, or be from the same country. In fact, learners are  <br />
&gt; encouraged to form teams and collaborate (via the Internet) with other  <br />
&gt; learners who have different levels of experience with, and access to,  <br />
&gt; technology resources, as well as with learners from different  <br />
&gt; countries, of different genders, and with different interests, skills,  <br />
&gt; and backgrounds. Each learner team member must make significant  <br />
&gt; contributions to the success of the team and be a full participant in  <br />
&gt; the development of its entry. Coaches may help with team formation,  <br />
&gt; provide guidance and encouragement, and help learners locate human,  <br />
&gt; technical and information resources in support of their efforts.  <br />
&gt; Coaches and others who are not learner team members may not work  <br />
&gt; directly on the entry. At least one coach and one learner team member  <br />
&gt; must have an active e-mail address that can be used for communication  <br />
&gt; with the TQA staff.<br />

<p>The cost of a computing device is one of the significant barriers holding back the use of ICT uptake in Africa, whether for personal, corporate or government use.  Devices like the simputer have yet to make a significant dent on this barrier.  However there are a number of experiments with PDAs that offer tantalising clues to ways in which it might be broken.
