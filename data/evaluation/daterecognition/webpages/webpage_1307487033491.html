A Communication Model
</H1>

<P>
On the one hand, you'd think we all understand what communication
is well enough to talk about it meaningfully, since we all do it from
a very young age. On the other hand, personal experience shows that
people get very easily confused about the communication that occurs
in the real world. Most people can't really answer ``What happens
when you request a web page from a web server?'' If you can't even
meaningfully answer questions about how things work or what happens,
how can you expect to understand the ethics of such actions? And a
complementary question, if one must have a post-grad degree in computer
science to understand what is going on, how can we expect to hold
anybody to whatever ethics may putatively exist?

<P>
Since nobody can adequately describe what's going on, the debates
almost inevitably degenerate into a flurry of metaphors trying to
convince you that whatever they are arguing about is the same as one
of the existing domains, and should be treated the same way. The metaphors
are all inadequate, though, because as shown earlier, there is a wide
variety of activities that do not fit into the old models <I>at
all</I>. As a result, the metaphor-based debates also tend to turn into
arguments about whether something is more like television or more
like a newspaper. There are sufficient differences between things
like using a search engine and reading a newspaper to render <I>any</I>
metaphor moot, so the answer to the question of which metaphor is
appropriate is almost always ``Neither.''

<P>
Before we can meaningfully discuss ethics, we need to establish what
we mean by communication, and create a model we can use to understand
and discuss various situations with. We'll find that simply the act
of clarifying the issues will immediately produce some useful results,
before we even try to apply the model to anything, as so frequently
happens when fuzzy conceptions are replaced by clear ones. After we're
done, we will not have need to resort to metaphors to think and talk
about communication ethics; we will deal with the ethical issues directly.
As a final bonus, the resultant model is simple enough that anybody
can use it without a PhD in computer network topology.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
The Model</A>
</H2>

<P>
For this model, I take my cue from the Internet and the computer revolution
itself, because it is a superset of almost everything else. Telecommunication
engineers and other people who deal with the technical aspects of
communication have created a very common model of communication that
has six components, which are a sender, an encoder, a medium, a decoder,
a receiver, and a message, as in figure <A HREF="#Standard_Communication_Model_Figure">10</A>.

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Standard_Communication_Model_Figure"></A><A NAME="2270"></A>

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
</DIV>

<P></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
The parts of this model are as follows:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Sender</B>: The sender is what or who is trying to send a message
to the receiver.
</LI>
<LI><B>Encoder</B>: In the general case, it is not possible to directly
insert the message onto the communications medium. For instance, when
you speak on the telephone, it is not possible to actually transmit
sound (vibrations in matter) across the wire for any distance. In
your phone is a microphone, which converts the sound into electrical
impulses, which <I>can</I> be transmitted by wires. Those electrical
impulses are then manipulated by the electronics in the phone so they
match up with what the telephone system expects.
</LI>
<LI><B>Message</B>: Since this is a communication engineer's model,
the message is the actual encoded message that is transmitted by the
medium. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Medium</B>: The medium is what the message is transmitted on.
The phone system, Internet, and many other electronic systems use
wires. Television and radio can use electromagnetic radiation. Even
bongo drums can be used as a medium (<a href="http://eagle.auc.ca/~dreid/overview.html">http://eagle.auc.ca/~dreid/overview.html</a>).
</LI>
<LI><B>Decoder</B>: The decoder takes the encoded message and converts
it to a form the receiver understands, since for example a human user
of the phone system does not understand electrical impulses directly.
</LI>
<LI><B>Receiver</B>: The receiver is the target of the message.
</LI>
</UL>
As a technical model this is fairly powerful and useful for thinking
about networks and such. However, since the model is for technical
people for technical purposes, it turns out that it's actually excessively
complicated for our purposes of modeling communication for the purpose
of ethics.

<P>
We can collapse the encoder and decoder into the medium, because we
never care about the details of the encoder or decoder in particular;
it is sufficient for our purposes to consider changes to the encoder
or decoder to be essentially the same as changes to the medium. 

<P>
That leaves us four basic components, as in figure <A HREF="#Simplified_Communication_Model_Figure">11</A>.

<P>
The base unit of this model can be called a <B>connection</B>.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>connection</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If there is an identifiable <B>sender</B>, <B>receiver</B>,
and <B>medium</B>, they define a <B>connection</B> along which
a message can flow. When the sender sends a <B>message</B>, the
medium transmits it, and the receiver receive the message.
</DD>
</DL>
Note that until the message is sent and recieved the medium may not
literally exist; for instance, your phone right now theoretically
connects to every other phone on the public network in the world.
However, until you dial a number or recieve a call, none of the connections
are ``real''.

<P>
A connection is always unidirectional in this model. If communication
flows in both directions, that should be represented as two connections,
one for each direction.

<P>
To send a message across the connection, a connection is initiated
by a sender, and the receiver must desire to receive it, excepting
sound-based messages which due to a weakness in our physical design
can be forced upon a reciever. Either can occur independently; a receiver
may be willing to receive a message, but the sender may not send it
until they are compensated to their satisfaction. A sender may wish
to send a message, but no receiver may be interested in receiving
it. 

<P>
For a given message from a sender to receiver, the ``medium''
is the everything the message traverses, no matter what that is. If
the phone system offloads to an Internet connection to transmit the
message part of the way, and the Internet connection is then converted
back to voice on the other end, the entire voice path is the medium.
It may sometimes be useful to determine exactly where something occurred,
but except for determining who is ``to blame'' for something,
all that really matters are the characteristics of the medium as a
whole.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">
Example</A>
</H2>

<P>
Let me show you an example of this model applied to one of the most
common Internet operations, a search engine query. Let's call the
search engine S (for Search engine) and the person querying the engine
P (for person). Let's assume P is already on the search engine's home
page and is about to push ``submit search''.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>P (as sender) opens a connection to S (as receiver) via the Internet
(the medium). P sends the search request (the message).
</LI>
<LI>S, which exists for the sole purpose of searching the Internet in
response to such requests, accepts the connection, receives the request
and begins processing it. In the past, the search engine has read
a lot of web pages. It puts together the results and creates a new
connection to P, who is now the receiver, using the Internet. It sends
back the results.

<P>
Technical people will note at this point that the same ``network
connection'' is used, as TCP is both send and receive, so no new
``network connection'' is ever created. This is true on a <I>technical</I>
level, but from <I>this model's</I> point of view, there is a new
``connection''; what constitutes a ``connection'' does not
always match the obvious technical behaviors.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>
On most search engine pages with most browsers, you'll also repeat
this step for each graphic on the results page, loading a graphic
that's on the page. In this case, the person P is the sender for the
first connection, the company running the search engine S is the receiver
for the first connection, and the medium is <I>everything</I> in between,
starting at P's computer and going all the way to the search engine
itself.

<P>
This model does not just apply to the Internet and computer-based
communication. It applies to <I>all</I> communication. When you buy
a newspaper, the newspaper is the medium, and the sender is the publisher.
When you watch television, the television is the medium, and the television
program station is the sender. When you talk to somebody, the air
is the medium and the speech is the message. This is a very general
and powerful model for thinking about <I>all</I> forms of communication.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">
Elaborations on the Model</A>
</H2>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00043100000000000000">
Chain of Responsibility</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are many elaborations on this basic model:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>an entity between the sender and receiver catches the message and
does something with it. The entity could cache it so future requests
are faster, log that a communication occurred, change the message,
completely block the message, or any number of other things.
</LI>
<LI>the communication medium itself may affect or manipulate the message
somehow, either according to someone's intent or by accident (transmission
flaw), especially as ``the medium'' can include computers and
other such things.
</LI>
</UL>
There are any number of ways to expand on those basic elaborations
of intercepting the message or manipulating the medium. An exhaustive
list of such things would take a long time, but fortunately there
is a relatively straightforward way of characterizing all of them.
Each possible elaboration consists of some other entity inserting
themselves into the connection somehow and manipulating the message
between receiver and sender. For every communication made, we can
catalog these entities and form a <I>chain of responsibility</I>.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>chain&nbsp;of&nbsp;responsibility</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The listing of all entities <I>responsible</I>
for manipulating a message in some form other then pure delivery.
</DD>
</DL>
Consider a newspaper story containing a quote from some source and
some commentary by a reporter. By giving the quote to the reporter
acting on behalf of the newspaper, the source is trying to communicate
with the readers of the newspaper story. In the communication from
the source to the reader, the newspaper intervenes, probably edits
the quote, and adds the rest of the article around it. In this case,
the newspaper is on the chain of responsibility for this communication.
This matches our intuition, namely that the newspaper could potentially
distort or destroy the message as it pleases, and it has responsibilities
that we commonly refer to as ``journalistic ethics'', which among
other things means that newspaper shouldn't distort the message.

<P>
Being ``responsible'' for a message means that you are able to
affect the message somehow, and are thereby at least partially responsible
for the final outcome of the communication. As I write this, millions
of conversations are occurring on a telephone. I am not on the chain
of responsibility for any of those communications because I have no
(practical) ability to affect any of those communications. On the
other hand, if someone calls my house and leaves a message with me
for my wife, I can affect whether that message is transmitted accurately,
or indeed at all. Alas, too frequently I forget to deliver it. Thus,
I am on the chain of responsibility for that message, since I have
demonstrated the capability of destroying the message before it got
to the recipient.

<P>
Anybody who can affect the message is therefore on the chain of responsibility
even if they have no technical presence on the medium. The biggest,
and perhaps only, example of this is a government, which may choose
to set rules about all messages that affect all message and thereby
have a degree of responsibility for all messages. For instance, the
government makes rules about ``libel'' and ``slander'', and
the government has the ultimate responsibility of enforcing them.
Since a government is capable of censoring a message, they are technically
on every message's chain of responsibility as a result, though the
impact is so diffuse that usually as a practical matter it's not worth
worrying about.

<P>
The chain of responsibility should consist <I>only</I> of people,
corporations in their capacity as people, and ``governments''
considered as people. Any time it seems like a machine or process
is on the chain of responsibility, it is really the person responsible
for that machine or process who is on the chain. The reason for this
is that a machine or device can not be ``responsible'' in the
ethical sense for anything, since they are not people. Sometimes it
is not obvious who that person is, and once again it can be a judgement
call exactly who is responsible. 

<P>
For example, consider a browser cache, which stores content from web
servers on behalf of the browser user, so they don't need to reload
it every time they wish to view it. (If you are reading this online,
the graphics used at the top of this page for navigating have most
likely been cached by your browser; if you go to the next page you
ought to immediately see those graphics, since your browser won't
need to load it from my website.) Clearly ``the browser cache''
is on the chain of responsibility of a standard web page retrieval
communication, because if it works incorrectly or has stale content,
it can prevent the user from receiving the correct message. But since
``the browser cache'' is (part of) a program, and programs aren't
allowed on the chain, who is responsible for the browser cache? The
obvious answer is the browser manufacturer, but as long as the cache
is implemented correctly, that is not necessarily the right answer.
Consider a lawsuit against someone who took content from a web browser's
cache and then illegally distributed it. Can the browser maker be
said to be involved with this? One could make a case for it...
perhaps the cache manufacturer should have encrypted the cached content
better so the user couldn't just take it out of the cache. On the
other hand, that's not necessarily a very convincing argument because
clearly the person who is illegally distributing the content is responsible,
and the fact that they got it from the cache merely incidental, as
they could have just as easily gotten it directly from the website.

<P>
Presence on the chain is not a binary off/on thing, because there
are different levels of responsibility. Sometimes it's not possible
to strictly determine whether an entity is ``on'' or ``off''
the chain. As usual in the real world, there are grays, and thus there
is room for legitimate disagreement about how responsible a given
entity is in some situations. The most useful question to ask is ``How
much influence can the person have on the message?'' Someone who
can silently manipulate the message to say anything they please obviously
has more responsibility then someone who can merely block one image
from loading on a web page, and can't hide their responsibility. In
the caching example, as long as the cache is correctly and honestly
implemented, the browser manufacturer has no effective ability to
control the messages I see.

<P>
Another example: We typically believe that the phone companies or
Internet search providers should not examine or modify the messages
we use their equipment to send, but just accurately transmit them.
In other words, we expect the ISPs and phone companies to stay off
the chain of responsibility by refusing to affect the message, despite
the fact that physically, our messages travel via their equipment
and they could fiddle with it if they chose. This is also a good example
of a time when literal physical reality doesn't perfectly match our
conception of ethics: If the phone company simply relayed our message,
we do not hold them ethically responsible for the contents of the
message, event though in a technical sense they are. In existing law
we refer to this as ``common carriers'', entities that simply
carry communication and are not responsible for the message, contingent
on their not affecting the message.

<P>

Time</A>
</H3>

<P>
Only in the modern era, through live television and radio, telephones,
and the Internet have we achieved effectively instantaneous communication
over long distance. A lot of communication is still not instantaneous.
Thus, a single ``connection'' may actually have a long life. When
one reads the Code of Hammurabi (<a href="http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm">http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm</a>)
(Hammurabi ruled in 1795-1750BC), one is reading a work across a connection
spanning nearly four thousand years. It can be instructive to consider
the chain of responsibility for the work: The original author, the
transcriptionist, the carver, the archaeologist, the translator, the
web site host... note that I am not on it, I'm just pointing
at the work and have no control over it. 

<P>
This is one of the reasons I define connections as a unidirectional
flow, rather then the more intuitive (under some circumstances) bi-directional
flow. ``Connections'', and more specifically, the ``messages''
quite frequently outlast their senders. Modelling that as bi-directional
would be challenging, what with one end being dead and all.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00043300000000000000">
Intention vs. Literal Speech</A>
</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="sub:Intention-vs.-Literal"></A>If you read ``Hlelo, how are
you?'', you still understand what I mean despite the typo. (I'm sure
you can find some more typos in this work elsewhere for more examples.)
But sometimes it isn't so easy to tell what the original message was
supposed to be, if the typo or corruption is bad enough. Or sometimes
the communicator can't or doesn't say what they mean, or it may not
be possible to directly say what they mean in a given medium.

<P>
It is always impossible for a receiver to be <I>completely</I> sure
they truly understand what the sender was trying to communicate with
their message. Rather then opening the topic of whether we can get
the ``true content'' from the message itself, which itself has
many large, heavily philosophical books written about it, we will
dedicate ourselves to the much simpler task of just trying to make
sure that the message itself, the sequence of bits over time, is adequately
transmitted from sender to receiver, because that's all we can do.

<P>
We will see this come into play later, as we try to determine whether
something <I>``really''</I> changed the content of a message or
not.

<P>

<BR>
Fundamental Property: Symmetry
</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal... <I>Declaration of Independence</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Probably the most important and perhaps surprising result of this
analysis is a re-affirmation of something that we all should have
understood all along: <B>There is no intrinsic ethical asymmetry
in the communication relationship</B>. There is no intrinsic value in
being the sender over being the receiver, or being the receiver over
being the sender. Indeed, every person and legal fiction (corporation,
government, etc.) that ever communicates in any fashion does so as
both a sender and a receiver at some point. 

<P>
I mention this to explicitly contradict the subtle, almost subconscious
insinuations by large content owners that they have some sort of <I>ethically</I>
advantageous position over consumers that should translate to various
special privileges. It <I>can be</I> the case that the sender has
something the receiver wants, which puts the sender <I>du jour</I>
in a position of power over the receiver, but this is an <I>economic</I>
position of power, not an <I>ethical</I> one. It is these relationships
that drive the so-called ``intellectual property'' industries.
At any moment the receiver may simply decide not to desire the sender's
message, whatever it may be (music, movies, newspapers, etc.), and
the economic power the sender has is gone. To the extent this remains
a purely monetary concern, the symmetry property is maintained, because
after all, the sender desires the receiver's money, too. Capitalism
is negotiating the level of desires in such a way that business occurs
and money and goods flow.

<P>
An example of such a ``special privilege'': Levies on blank media
based on the assumption that the some of the media will be used to
illegally copy content, which are paid to the certain large companies
who own content. The right to charge what is in every sense a tax
is granted to these companies simply because they own content, regardless
of whether a given purchaser will actually use if for illegal copying.
We consumers don't even subsequently receive the right to place whatever
we want on this media based on the fact that we have quite literally
already paid for it (at least in the US), which might do something
to restore the symmetry; we can still be prosecuted for ``piracy''.
So media companies receive these fees not because it is part of a
mutually beneficial bargain, not because it is part of some general
mechanism available to all senders, but because they enjoy special,
asymmetrical privileges not available to the rest of us.

<P>
It is ethically dangerous to promote one person or entities interests
over another, for much the same reason that the authors of the Declaration
saw fit to put ``all Men are created Equal'' right at the top.
Once stipulated that one entity is superior to another, history shows
us time and time again that the leverage is used to gather just a
bit more power, and a bit more, and a bit more, and so on and so forth
until the inequity is so great the inferior entity rebels in some
manner. The authors of the Declaration of Independence were quite
familiar with history, and they found this so clear they called it
<I>self-evident</I>. If you don't agree that this is bad, I really
don't know how to convince you; this is axiomatic.

<P>
But beyond the basic argument from ``self-evidence'' that I just
gave you, there is a deeper reason this property must hold: Because
any entity is both a sender and a receiver, any ``special'' treatment
accorded to one side must paradoxically be accorded to the other to
be at all consistent. This can be hard to grasp, but perhaps the best
example is the Berman-Coble bill (see <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/cat_bermancoble.html">http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/cat_bermancoble.html</a>),
which would grant a copyright holder special power in enforcing their
copyright. The music industry desires this power, yet when faced by
the actual bill, it occurred to them and many others that the bill
could equally well be used against them by <I>other</I> copyright
holders (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110159/stories/2002/08/14/hackingTheLaw.html">http://radio.weblogs.com/0110159/stories/2002/08/14/hackingTheLaw.html</a>).
And suddenly, the bill looks much less attractive... You can
not grant special concessions to either side of the communication
relationship, because those same privileges will turn around and bite
back in the next minute as roles reverse. Only an entity which <I>only</I>
consumes or <I>only</I> produces can afford this sort of thing, and
it is really hard to imagine such an entity; even the mythical ``pure
consumer'' expects that at least in theory, if they choose to communicate
they will have free speech, copyright protection, and all of the other
reasonable things one expects to protect one's communication.

<P>
A couple of other examples: Software companies trading demographic
information about their customers like baseball cards yet trying to
block the consumer equivalents, such as performance benchmarks of
the software (see the UCITA provisions (<a href="http://www.cisp.org/imp/september_99/09_99simons-insight.htm">http://www.cisp.org/imp/september_99/09_99simons-insight.htm</a>)).
I acknowledge as one of the counterexamples to this symmetry principle
the government's occasional need to keep information classified, but
we have the Freedom of Information Act too, showing the balance is
merely tipped, not broken. 

<P>
In some situations, one may voluntarily agree to forgo the symmetry
and agree to some set of constraints imposed in a contract by another
entity. This exchange of rights is what lies behind our contract law.
However, it is unethical to require someone to forgo this symmetry
without compensation. Due compensation is a big part of contract law,
and I remind you I use ``law'' here in the sense of ``applied
ethics''; in theory, a contract is not valid unless both sides receive
something of value. It is a judgement call exactly where the line
is drawn. You will probably be unsurprised that I consider the actions
of music companies unethical at this point, increasingly requiring
that the user commit to not performing actions acceptable in the past
(such as making personal copies), and yet charging the same amount
or even <I>more</I> as was charged historically for the same goods.

<P>
Sorry to beat on the music industry, but they have been the most aggressively
honest about their intentions regarding these issues. They aren't
the only group I disagree with, they just provide the most vivid illustrations.

<P>

A Natural Balance</A>
</H3>

<P>
This symmetry has always been with us; as I mentioned in the Ethical
Drift (section <A HREF="node3.html#Ethical_Drift">2.3.3</A>), we've forgotten after so many
years of the current status quo. A nice side effect of re-recognizing
the symmetry of communication, that all people have equal rights to
communicate, is that it provides us a nice balancing point. This principle
provides a natural way of examining the relationships between various
entities and considering how ethical they are. Is one side elevating
itself over the other? Is the other side <I>justly</I> compensated
for this elevation? (Mere compensation is not enough; if you paid
me a penny for forty hours of work, you are unjustly taking advantage
of me, even though I am ``compensated''.) Is a larger entity using
its size abusively? Just this one simple, nearly-forgotten principle
has a lot of resolving power when the proper questions are asked.

<P>

Fundamental Property: Only Humans Communicate</A>
</H2>

<P>
You remember figure <A HREF="#Simplified_Communication_Model_Figure">11</A>,
where I first showed the communication model I'm building? See the
people on each side of the connection? One must never forget that
<B>communication only occurs between people</B> (and corporations
in their capacity as people). This may sound like a strange thing
for a computer scientist to say, but <B>it is vital to not get
distracted by the technology</B>. Computers are <I>null entities</I>
in ethical terms. Only how people use them matter.

<P>
This is critical because it <I>is</I> so easy to get sidetracked by
the technology, but the tech just <I>doesn't matter</I>, except inasmuch
as it allows and enables communication among humans. If a computer
just randomly downloads something for no human reason (say, some weird
transient bug due to a power spike) and it will never be seen by a
human, it really doesn't matter. If someone downloads a music file
from a fellow college dorm resident and immediately deletes it, it
may be technically illegal (in the ``against the law'' sense),
but ethically I'd say that's a null event. If anything occurs that
never makes it back to a human being at some point, who really cares?

<P>
It is worth pointing out that by and large, current law sees things
this way as well. One does not arrest a computer and charge it with
a crime (exempting certain cases created in the War on Drugs, which
is beside my point here).

<P>
The claim that computers can violate the copyright of software by
loading into memory from the disk (necessitating a license that permits
this act)? As stupid as it sounds. Who <I>cares</I> what a computer
does? The only actions that matter are those performed by a human.
Media are just tools, they have no ethical standing of their own.
In fact, a human never experiences <I>any</I> copy of any communication
located on a hard drive. The only copy that matters is the one the
human is actually experiencing, which are the actual photons or air
vibrations or whatever else used to ``play'' or ``consume''
the media.

<P>
<B>Only people matter.</B>

<P>
An example to illustrate the point: Suppose a hacker breaks into a
computer and installs FTP server software on the computer, allowing
it to serve illegally copied software and music. Suppose that four
days later, the computer owner notices and takes immediate action
to shut the FTP server down. During those four days, the computer
may have served out thousands of copyright violations. Ethically,
can we hold the computer, and by extension, the computer owner responsible?
No! We should hold the hacker responsible, not the computer. Only
humans communicate, and the computer owner was not even aware of the
offending communication, and took no actions to enable it. His or
her computer was being used in communication as a medium by completely
different senders and receivers. Ethically, the owner was an innocent
bystander to the software piracy.

<P>
Note this scenario happens daily, and to the best of my knowledge
nobody has ever been prosecuted for being hacked and having an FTP
server run on their machine. This could change at any time...

The Key to Robustness: Follow The Effects</A>
</H3>

<P>
It turns out this fundamental property is the key to robustness (as
defined in <A HREF="node14.html#sub:Robustness">B.2</A>). If we had to pay attention to the
actions of every computer and router and device between the sender
and the receiver, we'd never be able to sort out the situation with
any degree of confidence. The modern Internet is quite complicated,
and some innovative and complicated ways of communicating have been
developed. As we try to apply older models to these issues, the complexity
explodes and we are left unable to determine anything useful about
the situation.

<P>
But we don't need to worry about the actions of every router and program
between the receiver and the sender. All we need to worry about are
the results, and who is on the chain of responsibility. <B>The
technology is unimportant.</B>

<P>
For instance, recall the example in <A HREF="node3.html#Australia_TV_licensing">2.3.4</A>,
where I talked about the Australia considering requiring licenses
for streaming video over the Internet. A bit of thought revealed the
complications inherent in the issue: What if I don't <I>stream</I>,
but provide <I>downloadable video</I>? What if I send chunks that
are assembled on the user's computer and claim I never actually sent
any actual <I>video</I>, just some random chunks of numbers? What
if I just want to stream video as a 1-to-1 teleconference? If you
define the problem in terms of what the <I>machines</I> are doing,
then any attempt at law-making is doomed to failure, because there's
always another way around the letter of the law. Instead, this ethical
principle says <I>follow the effects</I>. If it looks like television,
where you are <I>in any way</I> making video appear to many hundreds
or thousands of users reasonably simultaneously, then call it television
and license it. I don't care if you're mailing thousands of people
CDs filled with time-locked video streams, bouncing signals off the
Moon, or using ESP. After all, Australia really only cares about <I>effects</I>;
the tech is just a red herring. On the other hand, Grandma emailing
a video, or 1-to-1 teleconferencing, is obviously not television.
The television commission should then leave it alone.

<P>
Of course there would be details to nail down about how exactly one
defines ``television'' (remember all those margin notes in the
communication history section?), but that's what government bureaucracies
are for, right? Going back to section <A HREF="node3.html#Axis_candidates">2.2.7</A>, ``scale
of people reached'' is a natural dimension to consider in this problem.
I'm not claiming this provides one unique answer, but actively remembering
the principle that <I>only humans communicate</I> provides a lot of
very important <I>guidance</I> in handling these touchy issues, and
makes it at least <I>possible</I> to create useful guidelines.

<P>
In fact, I submit that no ethical system for communication can fail
to include this as a fundamental property. Not only is it nonsensical
to discuss the actions of computers in some sort of ethical context,
I think it would be impossible to create a system that would ever
actually <I>say</I> anything (see ``Usefulness'' as a criterion
in section <A HREF="node14.html#sub:Usefulness">B.5</A>), due to huge number of distinct
technological methods for obtaining the same effects. Consider just
as one example the incredibly wide variety of ways to post a small
snippet of text that can be viewed by arbitrary numbers of people:
Any number of web bulletin board systems, a large number of bulletin
board systems over Telnet, Usenet, email mailing lists with web gateways,
literally hundreds of technological ways of producing the same basic
effect. Yet despite the near-identical effect produced by those technologies,
if we insist on closely examining the technology, each of those has
slightly different implications for who is hosting the content, where
the content ``came from'', who is on the chain of responsibility
of a given post, etc. Are we going to legislate on a case by case
basis, which even in this small domain is hundreds of distinct technologies?
The complexity of communication systems is already staggering, and
it's not getting any easier. On the whole, we <I>must</I> accept this
principle, or effectively admit defeat.

Fundamental Property: Everything Is Digital</A>
</H2>

<P>
Everything is digital. There is no analog to speak of; analog is an
artifact of technology, with little to no discernable advantages over
digital, except for generally requiring somewhat less sophisticated
technology to create and use.

<P>
Why is this true? Because digital subsumes analog into itself: Everything
analog can become digital, with all the copying and distribution benefits
thereof. The Internet even provides us with a way to digitize things
that might seem like too much effort to digitize by allowing people
to easily distribute the workload. Even the daunting task of digitizing
centuries of books has been undertaken, and by now, any book that
is old enough to be out of copyright, and is famous enough for you
to think of off the top of your head, has been digitized and is available
at Project Gutenburg<A NAME="tex2html16"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot409"><SUP>5</SUP></A>. Other examples:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The Project Gutenburg Distributed Proofreaders (<a href="http://www.pgdp.net/">http://www.pgdp.net/</a>)
convert public domain books into electronic text by parceling out
the various necessary actions to many people. One person scans in
the book, a page at a time, which currently is the hardest thing any
single person has to do, though there is some hope that robotics can
take over this job in the future. The pages are run through an OCR
software program, which is much better then nothing but is very noticably
inaccurate. The Distributed Proofreaders project uses the web to then
present each page and the results of the OCR to a human, who corrects
the errors the computer has made. The page and the corrected text
are then presented to a <I>second</I> human for further verification,
and finally one person knits all the contributions into a whole, coherent
e-text.

<P>
As I write this, the Distributed Proofreaders are doing such things
as <I>War Poetry of the South</I> by William Gilmore Simms (ed.),
<I>Quatrevingt-Treize, Abridged</I> by Victor Hugo, in the original
French and English, <I>Lessons and Manual</I> of Botany by Asa Gray,
and <I>Familiar Quotations</I> by Bartlett (edition not specified).
If anything, I've biased this list in <I>favor</I> of the things I
at least recognize (Victor Hugo and <I>Familiar Quotations</I>), as
I do not immediately recognize anything else they are currently doing.
The ``popular'' works have long since been done.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The market grew tired of waiting for popular books like the <I>Harry
Potter</I> series to be translated into their language, so a distributed
<I>translation</I> project sprung up around <I>Harry Potter and
the Order of the Pheonix</I> and had it translated into German (<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/07/07/2142259.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/03/07/07/2142259.shtml</a>),
in at least an attempt to beat the official translation. (Anyone who
can read German is invited to tell me whether they succeded or not.)
Conversions of the book into digital form were available online before
the book was even officially released, transcribed from the book.
Even before the book was officially published as an E-book, the information
was digitized.
</LI>
<LI>In fact it's getting so easy to transfer book content into the digital
realm that book stores are beginning to become concerned about people
coming in with cameras on their celluar phones and taking pictures
of the pages of books and magazines (<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/02/232259">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/02/232259</a>).
How widespread this is I can't say yet, but there's every reason to
expect this will become more popular as more phones have cameras embedded
in them.
</LI>
</UL>
And that's the <I>hard</I> stuff, like text content. Audio content
is so easy to digitize, with such high quality, as such low prices,
it's actually shaking up the music industry as it becomes possible
for garage bands to suck their sound into the digital realm and manipulate
it like the professionals do. Some domains are still tough, like sculpture
and 3D art, but certainly not impossible; for instance, every major
special-effects laden movie now uses motion capture, which digitizes
motion, frequently in conjunction with machines that scan the actual
contours of someone's face, so an actor's face can be used on the
computer model. Someday we'll be able to do this in our garages, too,
because all that is theoretically needed is a camera, enough processing
power, and some clever algorithms; the elaborate setups and dot-laden
costumes used by the professionals currently are merely expressions
of our technological limitations. It seems to be an unofficial goal
of the next generation of gaming consoles (PS3 as of this writing)
to have some primitive versions of this capability; one implementation
already exists in the form of the EyeToy for the PlayStation 2.

<P>
There is a tempation to try to partition communication ethics into
``Analog'' ethics and ``Digital'' ethics, but it is hopeless
because in the end, there is no real fundamental difference between
the two. ``Analog'' is just a special case of ``Digital''
where the limitations of technology happen to make it unusually difficult
to copy reliably, but that property is not fundamental to the underlying
message. There is no point in trying to distinguish between ``analog''
and ``digital'' ethically. Talking about the ``analog hole''
is meaningless; it's just a glorified way of saying that people's
ability to copy your content is a problem, with the word ``analog''
just muddying the discussion. 

<P>
Actually, I'm bending the truth here for simplicity's sake; ethically,
the representation is simply <I>meaningless</I> until it's converted
at some point into something a human can experience. So it's not that
``everything's digital'', it's that for our purposes there's simply
no such <I>thing</I> as ``digital'' vs. ``analog''. Whether
a song is stored as pits on a plastic platter or as magnetic variations
on a metallic tape, the medium doesn't matter to the message. But
given the way most people currently think of the word ``digital'',
saying ``everything is digital'' is more likely to be correctly
understood.

To review:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Communication can be modelled as a set of <B>connections</B> along
which <B>messages</B> flow from a <B>sender</B> to a <B>receiver</B>
on some <B>medium</B>. A given interaction may require several such

(one from the person requesting the page, one to return the page to
that person).
</LI>
<LI>Several elaborations on the model exist in the real world, which can
complicate the model primarily by adding more entities to the <B>chain
of responsibility</B>, who have the opportunity to fiddle with the message(s).
</LI>
<LI>We take as an axiom that <B>communication is symmetric</B>. There
is no intrinsic <I>ethical</I> value in being the sender or receiver,
or in possessing some message that somebody else wants.
</LI>
<LI><B>There is no analog</B>, only digital, and things that aren't
digital quite yet, but could be if enough people cared.
</LI>
<LI>We observe that <B>only humans communicate</B>. We also note that
we either <I>must</I> accept this as true, or give up any hope of
having a rational system of ethics that can actually claim something
is ethical or unethical.
</LI>
</UL>
Now that we have examined the history of communication, laid down
our goals in building an ethical system, and created a model we can
use to model actions in the real world and communicate about their
effects, we are finally ready to begin applying what we've built to
real-world situations.
