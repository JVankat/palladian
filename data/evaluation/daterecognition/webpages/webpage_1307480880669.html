      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The &quot;Farewell Pilgrimage&quot;
      completed, tens of thousands of pilgrims began their return home. Those
      who came from the desert returned to the desert; those who came from
      Tihamah returned hence, and those who came from the south, from Yaman,
      Hadramawt and neighboring territories, did likewise. The Prophet and his
      immediate companions set out in the direction of Madinah. When they
      reached it, they settled down confident that peace had covered the entire
      Peninsula. Henceforth, it was natural that Muhammad became preoccupied
      with the conditions of those countries under the dominion of Byzantium and
      Persia, especially al Sham, Egypt, and `Iraq. Now that the people have
      converted to Islam in such large groups, that their delegations had
      already declared in Madinah their obedience and committed their peoples to
      serve under its banner and, finally, now that all the Arabs have united in
      this &quot;Farewell Pilgrimage,&quot; the Arabian Peninsula became secure
      in its entirety. Indeed, there was no reason for any of the Arab kings and
      princes to withdraw or to violate loyalty to the Prophet or to his
      religion. Under no other regime did they enjoy more power and internal
      autonomy than under that which the unlettered Prophet had instituted.
      8adhan, the Persian governor of Yaman, was reinstated in his governorship
      as soon as he converted to Islam. In recognition of this, Badhan preserved
      the unity of Arabia and threw off the yoke of the Zoroastrian Persians.
      Whatever little rumblings took place in the Peninsula never came close to
      resembling rebellion, and they did not occupy the Prophet or raise in him
      any apprehension for the future. The dominion of the new religion had
      firmly spread over all parts of the Peninsula; all faces were turned to
      the living and eternal God, and all hearts truly believed in the One, the
      Almighty.</font></p>

      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, Times" color="#006699">The Prophetic Pretenders<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">It was natural, therefore, that the
      pretenders to prophethood who arose at the time were not the object of
      anxiety or care on Muhammad's part. True, some of the tribes in the
      outlying distances hastened to listen to any pretender, especially after
      they had heard of the Prophet of God and of the success of his mission.
      Obviously, such tribes wished they had the same good fortune as the
      Prophet's tribe, Quraysh. Precisely because of their distance from Makkah
      and from the headquarters of the new religion, such tribes did not yet
      fully absorb the new religion. However, this new religion, this honest and
      candid call to God, struck its roots firmly everywhere else. To resist it
      would not be easy. The anecdotes of Muhammad's travails and sacrifices for
      the sake of his mission had already spread to the horizons, and everyone
      knew that none but Muhammad ibn `Abdullah was capable of such sacrifice.
      Every false pretension, however, must sooner or later be exposed; and no
      pretender to prophethood can meet with any long lasting success. Tulayhah,
      for instance, the leader of Banu Asad and one of the greatest war heroes,
      a real lord of the desert, pretended that he, too, was a prophet and an
      apostle. He claimed that his true prophesying about the exact location of
      water when his people were lost in the desert, and almost perished from
      thirst, was the proof of his prophethood. But he remained afraid of
      contradicting Muhammad or withdrawing his loyalty to him as long as the
      Prophet lived. He therefore rebelled only after Muhammad's death. It was
      Ibn al Walid that led the Muslim forces in suppressing the rebellion of
      Tulayhah. Upon his defeat, Tulayhah once more joined the ranks of Islam
      and henceforth led, a virtuous life. On the other hand, neither Musaylimah
      not al Aswad al `Ansi fared any better than Tulaybah as long as the
      Prophet lived. The former sent to the Prophet-may God's blessing be upon
      Him-a message saying, &quot;I, too, am a prophet like you. To us belongs
      half the earth, and to Quraysh belongs the other half, if Quraysh were
      only just.&quot; When Musaylimah's two messengers delivered this message
      of their master to Muhammad, the Prophet told them that, were it not for
      the conventional security granted to messengers, he would have ordered
      them executed. He then asked them to convey to Musaylimah the reply that
      Muhammad heard his message and realized its lies. The earth belongs to
      none but God, and God grants it to whomsoever He chooses among His worthy
      and righteous servants. Peace belongs to the rightguided.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">As for al Aswad al 'Ansi, the Governor
      of Yaman after the death of Badhan, he began to practice magic and to call
      people to believe in him until he had achieved a measure of strength. Then
      he marched from the south toward Yaman and expelled Muhammad's governors
      from the territory. He marched on Najran and killed its governor, the son
      of Badhan who inherited the office from his father. A1 Aswad then married
      the widow of the fallen ruler and brought the whole area under his
      dominion. All this, however, did not worry Muhammad nor did it call, in
      his judgment, for more than a word to his governors and agents in Yaman to
      pull al Aswad down. The Muslims of the area fulfilled the command of the
      Prophet by themselves, turned- the tables on al Aswad and ended his
      regime. And it was his own wife who put an end to his life in vengeance
      for the blood of her first husband.</font></p>

      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, Times" color="#006699">The Prophet's Concern for the Northern Front<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Muhammad's care and preoccupation,
      therefore, were directed toward the north, not toward the south of Arabia.
      This was especially so following his return from the &quot;Farewell
      Pilgrimage.&quot; In fact, ever since the campaign of Mu'tah, when the
      Muslims returned without conquest after the clever and strategic
      withdrawal of Khalid ibn al Walid, Muhammad had been giving to Byzantium a
      good portion of his thought and careful planning. He was convinced that
      Muslim power at the northern frontier with al Sham should be firmly
      established if those who had been evacuated from the Peninsula and who had
      emigrated to Palestine were not to return and attack again. It was in
      consequence of this care that Muhammad mobilized a very massive army when
      he heard that the Byzantines were about to advance on the northern
      frontier, and he himself led that army all the way to Tabuk. The
      Byzantines had withdrawn toward the interior upon hearing of the march of
      that army. This notwithstanding, Muhammad continued to plan for the day
      when the lords of Christendom who dominated the world through Byzantium
      might be stirred to attack in resentment against those who had brought
      Christianity to an end in Najran and other places in Arabia. Consequently,
      the Muslims did not stay long in Madinah following their return from the
      farewell Pilgrimage in Makkah. The Prophet had immediately ordered the
      mobilization of a large army and commanded it to march on al Sham. That is
      why he sent along with that army a number of the elders of Islam, the
      earliest Muhajirun, among whom were Abu Bakr and `Umar. That is why he
      gave the command of the army to Usamah ibn Zayd ibn Harithah.</font></p>

      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, Times" color="#006699">The Prophet's Counsel to Usamah<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Usamah ibn Zayd, the commander of the
      army, was then a young man hardly twenty years of age. His appointment and
      precedence over the elders of Islam, the early Muhajirun, and greater
      companions of the Prophet, would have caused quite a stir among the people
      had it not been for everybody's genuine faith in the Prophet's judgment
      and calculation. By appointing him, the Prophet sought to place him in the
      same command in which his father fell in the campaign of Mu'tah. The
      Prophet had wanted to give Usamah cause for pride in victory tantamount to
      a reward for the martyrdom of his father. Moreover, such an appointment
      was sure to stir within the soul of the youth the greatest resolution,
      determination, and bravery. It was also meant as an example for the youths
      of Islam to carry the burden of great responsibility. Muhammad commanded
      Usamah and his army to enter the approaches of al Balqa' and al Darum in
      Palestine, in the vicinity of Mu'tah where his father had fallen. He also
      commanded him to fight the enemy in the early hours of dawn, to fight them
      fearlessly, and to shower them with fire. He also commanded him to
      surprise the enemy, never to let the news of his advance reach them
      beforehand. Once victory was achieved, Usamah was to return home quickly
      and not to extend his stay in those lands.</font></p>

      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, Times" color="#006699">The Prophet's Illness<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Usamah and his army set up their
      headquarters at al Jurf, in close proximity to Madinah, and there began
      their preparation for the long trip to Palestine. While they were getting
      ready, the Prophet of God fell ill and the seriousness of his-ailment
      prevented their going forth. One may ask with surprise how the sickness of
      the Prophet of God could prevent an army from undertaking a campaign which
      he himself had ordered. One must remember, however, that for that army to
      go to al Sham, it had to cross wide deserts and empty places, a matter
      that was not at all easy and would take many long days. It was not easy
      for the Muslims, considering their great love for the Prophet, to leave
      Madinah while he suffered from grave illness. Those same men knew that the
      Prophet never suffered from any serious ailment. Nothing had adversely
      affected his health throughout this period except a brief lack of appetite
      in 6 A.H. falsely attributed to Jewish magic, and a little discomfort
      following his eating a bite of poisoned lamb in 7 A.H. Furthermore, the
      rhythm of his life and the logic of his teachings always protected him
      against disease. He always ate little and satisfied himself with the
      barest and simplest necessities. His clothes and his house were always
      perfectly clean, for Muhammad not only saw to it that the duties of
      ablutions were perfectly carried out at all times, but he even used to
      say: &quot;Were it not for my fear of imposing hardship on my people, I
      would have made it a duty for them to brush their teeth five times a
      day.&quot; On the other hand, the ritual of prayer and daily exercise
      which Muhammad observed as well as his sense for economy in the pursuit of
      pleasure, his refrain from indulgences of all kinds, and his general
      unconcern for things of this world which always kept him at a distance
      from them, but in communion with cosmic life and the secrets of existence
      all these aspects of his character protected him against disease and gave
      him good health. His strong natural, construction and innate inclination
      to moral goodness consolidated his immunity against disease.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Now that he had fallen seriously ill,
      however, it was natural for his friends and companions to become concerned
      and anxious, fearing that the untold energies he spent during the last
      twenty years of life may have been begun to take effect upon him. Ever
      since he had proclaimed his prophethood in Makkah and begun to call men to
      worship God alone, to abandon the idols of the ancestors, Muhammad had met
      such great opposition and hardship that his companions had to flee to
      Abyssinia and he himself to the seclusion of the mountains in the
      outskirts of Makkah. His flight from Makkah to Madinah, following the
      covenant of `Aqabah, took place under the most trying and dangerous of
      conditions. Muhammad did not know what awaited him in Madinah before he
      arrived there under cover of night. When he did arrive there, he
      immediately became the object of Jewish plotting and intrigue. After God
      gave him victory following all these trials and permitted men from all
      corners to join the new faith, Muhammad's duties multiplied to a
      tremendous extent. The keeping of the peace, the leadership of the
      community, the establishment of its institutions, the continuous wars he
      had to fight, and the attacks he had to repel would have broken the back
      of the strongest man.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">What situation could have been more
      tragically trying than that in which Muhammad found himself at the Battle
      of Uhud when the Muslims ran away from their enemy and Muhammad ascended
      the hill alone pursued by Quraysh's soldiers; when, under a shower of
      enemy arrows and stones, he fell wounded, with his teeth broken? What
      position could be more frightening than that in which the Prophet found
      himself at the Battle of Hunayn when the Muslims fell back at dawn before
      their attacking enemies when so determined was their retreat that Abu
      Sufyan could say that &quot;Only the sea could make them turn back
      again&quot;; when in the midst of this retreating stream of people
      Muhammad held his ground and called unto the Muslims: &quot;Where to?
      Where to? Come back! Come back to me!&quot; until they returned and were
      victorious. Moreover, there was the burden of mission, the tremendous
      burden of revelation, the self exhausting spiritual effort to keep in
      communion with the reality of the universe, with the supernal plenum-an
      effort the Prophet was reported to have described as more horrendous than
      the destiny of doom which befell Hud and other ancient civilizations.
      Muhammad's companions were witnesses to all this. They had seen him bear
      his burdens uprightly and with determination, never faltering. Now that he
      had fallen ill after such a splendid career, it was natural for them to
      want to postpone their march to al Sham for a while, until they could
      reassure themselves of God's disposition.</font></p>

      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">In the meantime, another event took
      place which added to the companions' anxiety. At the beginning of his
      illness, Muhammad suffered from sleeplessness. On one night, as the days
      were long and hot and the nights short and breezy, Muhammad felt like
      going out of his house for a walk around the city. Only his servant, Abu
      Muwayhibah, accompanied him on this promenade. But where would he go? He
      went to Baqi` al Gharqad where all the cemeteries of the Muslims lay on
      the outskirts of Madinah. According to the reports, he stood between the
      graves of his fallen companions and addressed them in the following words</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">&quot;Peace be upon you who are in these
      graves. Blessed are you in your present state to which you have emerged
      from the state in which the people live on earth. Subversive attacks are
      falling one after another like waves of darkness, each worse than the
      previous one.&quot; Abu Muwayhibah related that the Prophet had told him
      upon arrival at Baqi` al Gharqad : &quot;I have been commanded to pray for
      those who lie in this terrain. Won't you come with me?&quot; After praying
      for the dead buried in that cemetery, when it was time to return home, the
      Prophet approached Abu Muwayhibah and said to him: &quot;0 Abu Muwayhibah,
      I have been given the keys of this world and eternity in it, and now I am
      being offered Paradise, and meeting with my God. I am asked to choose
      between them.&quot; Abu Muwayhibah said: &quot;What would I not give for
      your sake, O Master! Is it not possible to have both? Do take the keys of
      this world, eternity in it, as well as Paradise.&quot; Muhammad answered:
      &quot;No, by God, 0 Abu Muwayhibah. I have chosen Paradise and meeting
      with my Lord.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Abu Muwayhibah must have reported what
      he had seen and heard. The Prophet began to complain from his sickness the
      morning following the night on which he had visited the cemetery of al
      Baqi`. It was then that the people became concerned and the army of Usamah
      did not move. True, the report of Abu Muwayhibah is doubted by many
      historians who believe that Muhammad's sickness could not have been the
      only reason that prevented the army from marching to al Sham, that another
      cause was the disappointment of many, including a number of elderly
      Muhajirun and Ansar, with respect to the leadership assigned to the army.
      They based their judgment on facts that are given in the sequel. Although
      we do not wish here to dispute their judgment concerning the report of Abu
      Muwayhibah, we do not find reason to justify their denial of the event
      altogether. Whatever the value of the report, it is not necessary to deny
      the event of the Prophet's visit to the cemetery of Baqi al Ghatqad, his
      prayer for its dead, or his realization that the hour of meeting with his
      Lord was soon to strike. In our age, science does not deny the possibility
      of communication between spirits. It subsumes such communication under the
      category of psychic phenomena. There have been many men endowed with
      strong and sensitive perception who knew that their hour was close, and
      many witnesses to this effect can be produced. Furthermore, communication
      between the living and the dead, the connection between the past and the
      present in a manner not limited by either space or time is today regarded
      as indubitable fact, although man's nature being what it is, it is not
      given for us to perceive its forms. There is hence no reason to deny the
      event of the Prophet's visit to the cemetery of Baqi` as out of place
      considering Muhammad's spiritual and psychic power of communication with
      the realms of reality and his awareness of spiritual reality that
      surpasses that of ordinary men.</font></p>

      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, Times" color="#006699">Muhammad's Congenial Mood<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">On the following morning, Muhammad found
      `A'ishah, his wife, complaining of a headache and holding her head between
      her hands, murmuring, &quot;0 My head!&quot; Having begun to feel pain,
      Muhammad answered, &quot;But rather, 0 `A'ishah, my own head!&quot;
      However, the pain was not strong enough to put him to bed, to stop his
      daily work, or to prevent him from talking kindly to his wives and joking
      with them. As `A'ishah continued to complain from her headache, Muhammad
      said to her: &quot;It wouldn't be too bad after all, 0 `A'ishah, if you
      were to die before me. For I would then pray for you and attend your
      funeral.&quot; But this only aroused jealousy in the youthful `A'ishah,
      who answered: &quot;Let that be the good fate of someone else besides me.
      By God, should that ever happen to me, your other wives would still be
      there to give you company.&quot; The Prophet smiled, but did not follow up
      the conversation because of an attack of pain. As soon as the pain
      subsided, he got up and visited with his wives just as he had always done.
      The pain returned with stronger force, however, so that Muhammad could not
      bear it any longer. He was in the quarters of Maymunah, his wife, when he
      found it necessary to call the members of his house and to ask all of them
      to attend to him in the quarters of `A'ishah. His wives agreed to nurse
      him there. He moved out of Maymunah's quarters, his head wrapped, leaning
      on `Ali ibn Abu Talib on one side and on al `Abbas, his uncle, on the
      other. His legs could hardly carry him. He entered the quarters of `A'ishah
      and there lay down.</font></p>

      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">His fever increased in the first days of
      his sickness so that he felt as if he were on fire. When the attacks of
      fever subsided, the Prophet walked to the mosque to lead the prayers. He
      continued to do so for several days but felt too weak to talk to his
      companions or to listen to them. But he could hear their gossip about his
      appointment of a very young man to command the elder Muhajirun and Ansar
      in the coming campaign against al Sham. Despite the gradual deterioration
      of his health and the aggravation of his pain, he felt it necessary to
      address the people on that subject.</font></p>

      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">One day he asked his wives and servants
      to pour on him seven goatskins of water from various wells. The water was
      brought from different wells as he commanded and poured over him as he sat
      in a tub belonging to Hafsah. He then put on his clothes, wrapped his
      head, and went to the mosque. Standing at the pulpit, he praised God,
      prayed for the martyrs of Uhud, and addressed the congregation in the
      following words: &quot;0 Men, carry out the expedition under Usamah. Your
      complaint against his generalship is of the same kind as your complaint
      against the generalship of his father before him. By God, Usamah is as fit
      for the generalship as was his father.&quot; Muhammad stopped for a while,
      and there was absolute silence. He then resumed his address, saying:
      &quot;Has he not made the better choice who, when given the option of
      taking this world, the other world, or properly acquiescing in whatever is
      with God, chooses the last alternative?&quot; Muhammad fell silent again,
      and the people were absolutely motionless. With his deep perception and
      sensitivity Abu Bakr realized that Muhammad was here referring to himself.
      His loyalty to the Prophet and profound feeling for his person overwhelmed
      Abu Bakr, who could not hold back his tears. Deeply moved and crying, he
      said: &quot;But we would give our own lives and the lives of our children
      for you, O Muhammad !&quot; Fearing the spread of Abu Bakr's contagious
      affection among the congregation, Muhammad said softly: &quot;0 Abu Bakr
      !&quot; He then commanded all the gates of the mosque to be closed except
      the one which led to the quarters of Abu Bakr. When this was done, he
      said: &quot;I do not know of anyone whose companionship is preferable to
      me than yours. Of all the people of the world, I would choose only Abu
      Bakr as a permanent friend and constant companion. His has been the
      friendship and fraternity of true faith! And it will last until God brings
      us together again.&quot; Muhammad left the pulpit to return to `A'ishah's
      quarters. As he did, he turned to the people and said: &quot;0 Muhajirun,
      be good to al Ansar. The Muslim community increases every day, but the
      number of al Ansar remains the same. A1 Ansar have been my own people, my
      trustworthy people among whom I have taken shelter. Be good to the
      virtuous among them, reward the pious, and forgive the wrongdoers.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Muhammad proceeded to the house of `A'ishah
      nearly exhausted by the effort he had exerted. When a man is ill,
      suffering from high fever, to get out of bed and go to the Mosque after
      having had to cool his body with seven skins of water is hard enough. How
      much more exacerbating must this brief outing have been for Muhammad when
      at the same time he had to confront such momentous matters as Usamah's
      mobilized army and the threatened fate of al Ansar as well as of the Arab
      ummah, newly cemented together by the religion of Islam? The following
      day, Muhammad tried to get out of bed and lead the prayers in the Mosque
      as usual. When he found his effort futile, he ordered that Abu Bakr lead
      the prayers in his place. `A'ishah was anxious for her husband to lead the
      prayers himself. She thought that nothing would better allay the fears of
      the people than for them to see the Prophet resume his daily functions.
      She therefore apologized for her father, Abu Bakr, saying that his voice
      was too soft and that he would break down and cry whenever he recited the
      Qur'an. Realizing his incapacity to rise from bed, the Prophet ordered
      once again that Abu Bakr lead the prayers. When `A'ishah insisted on her
      objection, the Prophet shouted in anger: &quot;How obsessive are women!
      Order Abu Bakr to lead the prayers at once.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">On another day, when Abu Bakr was
      absent, Bilal called the Muslims to prayer and invited `Umar to lead them.
      As `Umar's loud voice reached the ear of the Prophet next door, he took
      this as another flouting of his previous command. He said: &quot;Where is
      Abu Bakr? God and the believers do not agree that Abu Bakr be not the
      leader.&quot; It was this incident that convinced the people that Muhammad
      has indeed appointed Abu Bakr as his successor, for leadership of the
      prayers was the foremost sign of succession to the Prophet.</font></p>

      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">After this, the Prophet's sickness and
      pain increased. His fever was so high that it could be felt by his wives
      and servants upon touching the blankets which covered him. Fatimah, his
      daughter, whom he loved deeply as his only surviving offspring, visited
      him every day. Whenever she entered his room, the Prophet would cry, kiss
      her, and give her his own chair. One day when she entered the room, he
      greeted her saying, &quot;Welcome, my daughter.&quot; But it was she who
      kissed him. He asked her to sit by him on his bed and whispered to her
      twice, first making her cry and then making her laugh. `A'ishah sought to
      discover what was said; but Fatimah refused to give away what she took to
      be a secret. It was not until after he died that Fatimah divulged what he
      had then told her, namely, that he was to die of that same sickness-which
      caused her to cry-and that she would be the first member of his family to
      join him after death which made her smile. In order to cool down his
      fever, Muhammad dipped his hand in a container by his bed, filled every
      now and then with cold water, and wiped his face. At times, the high fever
      gave him convulsions. Recovering from one of those attacks, he overheard
      his daughter, Fatimah, say with deep sorrow: &quot;Oh, the terrible pain
      my father is suffering!&quot; At this Muhammad said, &quot;Your father
      will suffer no more pain after this day,&quot; meaning that he was to meet

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Anxious to lighten his pain, his
      companions reminded him that he had counseled them not to complain when
      sick. He apologized to them, saying that his pains surpassed whatever any
      two of them could bear together. While under a strong attack of fever and
      surrounded by visitors, he asked that pen and ink and paper be brought. He
      said he would dictate something for his followers' benefit, assuring them
      that if they adhered to it, they would never go astray. Some of the people
      present thought that since the Prophet-may God's peace and blessing be
      upon him-was severely ill and since the Muslims already had the Qur'an, no
      further writing was necessary. It is related that that thought belonged to
      `Umar. The people present disagreed among themselves, some wishing to
      bring writing materials and take down what the Prophet would dictate, and
      others thinking that any further writing besides that of the Book of God
      would be superfluous. Muhammad asked them all to leave, saying, &quot;It
      does not become you to disagree in my presence.&quot; Ibn `Abbas felt
      concerned that the people would lose something important if they did not
      hasten to bring the writing materials, whereas `Umar held firmly to his
      judgment which he based upon God's own estimate of His Holy Book: &quot;In
      this scripture, We have left out nothing.&quot; <font color="#FF211C">[</font></font><font color="#FF211C">Qur'an, 6:38. There can be little doubt that this story is

of <i>hadith </i>in the framework of Islamic Law and ideas. It is not likely
that Muhammad's closest and most trusted companions or the members of his house

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">As the news of the deteriorating health
      of the Prophet spread, Usamah and a number of his aides left their
      encampment at al Jurf for Madinah seeking reassurance concerning the
      Prophet's health. Usamah entered the quarters of `A'ishah unable to speak.
      But when Muhammad saw Usamah, he lifted his hands toward the sky before
      placing them on Usamah's shoulders, as a sign of prayer for him.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Members of the Prophet's household saw
      fit at this stage to give him some medicine which Asma', a relative of
      Maymunah, had learned to prepare during her stay in Abyssinia. Taking
      advantage of Muhammad's loss of consciousness, they poured the medicine
      into his mouth. When he came back to himself, he asked who had given him
      the medicine and why. His uncle, al `Abbas, explained that they had
      prepared it and given it to him because they feared he had pleurisy. The
      Prophet said, &quot;That is a disease, which God would not inflict upon
      me.&quot; He then ordered everyone in the house except his uncle, al `Abbas,
      to taste it. Even Maymunah, who was then fasting, was forced to taste it.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At the beginning of his illness,
      Muhammad had in his house seven Dinars ; he feared he might die while some
      money was still in his possession. He therefore commanded his relatives to
      give the money away to the poor. However, their preoccupation with his
      sickness and constant attendance upon him, in addition to their concern
      for his deteriorating health, caused them to forget to execute his order.
      When he came to himself on Sunday, on the eve of the day of his death, he
      inquired whether they had fulfilled his order. `A'ishah answered that the
      money was still in her possession. He asked her to bring it forth to put
      on the palm of his hand. He then said: &quot;What spectacle is this of
      Muhammad, if he were to meet God in this condition?&quot; The money was
      given forthwith to the poor.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Muhammad spent a peaceful night in which
      his fever seemed to subside. It was as if the medicine which his relatives
      had prepared for him had somewhat alleviated the disease. In the morning
      he was even able to go to the mosque although his head was still wrapped
      and he needed to lean on 'Ali ibn Abu Talib and al Fadl ibn al `Abbas for
      support. Abu Bakr was leading the prayer at the time of Muhammad's entry
      into the mosque. As the Muslims saw the Prophet come in, they were so
      overjoyed at his recovery that they almost allowed their prayer to be
      interrupted. Abu Bakr raised his voice in the recitation signaling that
      the prayer must go on and not be interrupted. Muhammad was extremely
      pleased with what he saw, and Abu Bakr knew well that the people would not
      have been diverted from prayer by the arrival of any other man. As
      Muhammad came close to Abu Bakr to join in the prayer, the latter moved
      himself away from his position of leadership so that the Prophet might
      take over. Muhammad, however, pushed him back into place saying, &quot;You
      lead.&quot; He sat beside Abu Bakr and prayed in a sitting position. When
      he finished, he joined the congregation and talked to them with a clear
      voice audible even outside the mosque. He said: &quot;0 Men, the fire is
      ready. Subversive attacks are advancing like the waves of darkness. By
      God, I shall not be held responsible for aught of this. I have never
      allowed anything but that which the Qur�an has made legitimate, and I
      have never forbidden aught which the Qur�an has not forbidden. God's
      curse is upon those who take graves for their mosques.&quot; <font color="#FF211C">[</font></font><font color="#FF211C">Here again, there can be little doubt of the spuriousness
of this report. It is evidently anachronistic and must have come from a much
later time than the Prophet's. Firstly, it is not possible that the Prophet had
such a low and pessimistic esteem of his time. At his death the Prophet stood at
the height of power, having welded Arabia into one powerful unity, strong enough
to venture beyond its borders. No Arab tribe or person was strong enough to wage
&quot;subversive attacks&quot; against the Islamic polity. Secondly, no
justification could be adduced for the Prophet's public defense of himself
because he was under serious attack from no one. No one in his senses could have
accused the Prophet of violating the legislation of the Qur'an. Thirdly, no
Muslims had at that time built mausoleums for anyone, including the Prophet, and
no one had used grave-sites or cemeteries as mosques. The Prophet's condemnation
is hence pointless. Granted, then, that this <i>hadith </i>was not the Prophet's
but that of later Muslims, it becomes a source of historical information about
its time. Only the late Umawi and early `Abbasi times could have presented
&quot;subversive attacks&quot; against the regime in power; only then could some
caliphs have been indicted for violating the Qur'anic legislation; and only
then, if not even much later, did Muslims begin the practice of building
mausoleum-mosques mostly under Sufi and Persian inspiration. -Tr.</font><font size="2"><font color="#FF211C">]</font></font></p>

      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The Muslims were so overjoyed at the
      signs of recovery in the health of their Prophet that Usamah ibn Zayd even
      asked for permission to march on al Sham. Indeed, even Abu Bakr came
      forward to say: &quot;0 Prophet of God, it is evident that God has granted
      you His blessing and given you good health just as we all wished and
      prayed. I had promised the Daughter of Kharijah [meaning his wife] to
      spend the day with her. May I take leave of you?&quot; The Prophet granted
      him leave, and Abu Bakr went to al Sunh on the outskirts of Madinah, where
      his wife resided. `Umar and `Ali returned to their business as usual. The
      Muslims dispersed in joy and happiness after their days of despondence
      over the news of Muhammad's illness. Muhammad returned to the quarters of
      `A'ishah made happy by the happiness of his fellow Muslims who filled the
      mosque to see him and who anxiously awaited to hear of his news. But he
      felt quite weak. `A'ishah helped her husband in with a heart full of awe
      and sympathy, wishing she could offer him her own life and energy to
      replace his waning strength.</font></p>

      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, Times" color="#006699">The Interlude of Wakefulness before Death<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The Prophet's visit to the mosque turned
      out to be only an interlude of wakefulness which precedes death. After he
      returned home, every minute saw further deterioration of his health. There
      was no doubt that he had only a few hours to live. How did he spend these
      last few hours of his life? What was his last vision? Did he spend those
      precious moments reviewing the career he had lived since God had
      commissioned him to prophethood and appointed him a guide to mankind? Did
      he recall the hardships he suffered, the joys he experienced, and the
      spiritual and military victories he achieved? Or did he spend his last
      moments praying to God and asking for mercy with all his soul and all his
      mind as he used to do throughout his life? Or was he too weak to review
      anything and too unconscious even to pray? The reports vary widely. Most
      reports tell that on that day, i.e., June 8, 632 C.E., one of the hottest
      days in Arabia, Muhammad asked for a pitcher of cold water in which he
      dipped his hands and wiped his face. Most reports state that a man from
      the clan of Abu Bakr entered the quarters of `A'ishah carrying a
      toothbrush in his hand. Muhammad looked at him in a way expressive of his
      desire to obtain the toothbrush. `A'ishah took the toothbrush from her
      relative and worked it out until it became pliable and handed it over to
      Muhammad who used it to brush his teeth.</font></p>

      <h4><!--mstheme--><font face="Garamond, Times New Roman, Times" color="#006699">&quot;Rather, God on High and Paradise&quot;<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
      </i>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The same reports also tell that as the
      agonies of death became stronger, the Prophet turned to God in prayer
      saying: &quot;0, God, help me overcome the agonies of death.&quot; `A'ishah
      reported that his head was in her lap during the last hour. She said,
      &quot;The Prophet's head was getting heavier in my lap. I looked at his
      face and found that his eyes had become fixed. I heard him murmur,
      'Rather, God on High and Paradise.' I said to him, 'By Him who sent you as
      a Prophet to teach the truth, you have been given the choice and you chose
      well.' The Prophet of God expired while his head was on my side between my
      lungs and my heart. It was my youth and inexperience that made me let him
      die in my lap. I then placed his head on the pillow and rose to bemoan my
      fate and to join the other women in our bereavement and sorrow.&quot;</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Did Muhammad truly die? That is the
      question over which the Arabs differed greatly at the time, indeed so
      greatly that they almost came to blows. Thanks to God's will and care, the
      division was quickly stamped out and the religion of the Hanifs, God's
      true religion, emerged unscathed.</font></p>
