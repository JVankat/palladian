<p>We've all read Shia LaBeouf's <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/06/16/shia-labeouf-says-spielberg-is-gearing-up-indiana-jones-5/">quotes</a>, we know he's all set for the fifth installment of one of my most beloved trilogies of all time - wait, there was a fourth <em>Indy</em> film? Hm. Must've missed that - oh, that's right, it was terrible and made me loathe everyone involved. <em>Right</em>. Well, <a href="(http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/06/18/hold-on-indiana-jones-5-isnt-as-far-along-as-you-think/">we were all updated</a> that the fifth installment, tentatively titled just <strong><em>Indiana Jones 5</em></strong>, was in the research phase a few months back, but according to <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20304223,00.html">People</a>, Indy himself, <strong>Harrison Ford</strong>, is ready to don the fedora and crack his whip again - depending on the script, of course. Although apparently Lucas and Spielberg have already figured out what the story is.<span id="more-19642"></span></p>
<p>"The story for the new <em>Indiana Jones</em> is in the process of taking form," Ford told France's Le Figaro. "Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and myself are agreed on what the fifth adventure will concern, and George is actively at work. If the script is <strong>good</strong>, I'll be very happy to put the costume on again." So there you go.</p>
<p>I love the <em>Indiana Jones</em> films. In fact, I judge people based on which film is their favorite (I'm a <em>Last Crusade</em> type of guy), but the putrid taste that <em>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em> left in my mouth has my gag reflex still a bit dodgy. I don't really want to see Mutt return at Indy's side in some kind of bastardization of the brilliance that was the father-son story in <em>The Last Crusade</em>. But, it's happening. The momentum is too great to be stopped. It's not that I don't think Ford can pull off the classic Indy swagger at the age of 67, and I'm not saying that there isn't a possibility that <em>Indy 5</em> could be a great action adventure film - it's just that the risk is too great. I've lost faith. Hopefully this story is an improvement. <strong>Is there <em>any</em> hope?</strong></p>

He can't. They hire an actual writer to come in and clean up all Lucas's stupid ideas. <br /><br />2)They do some makeup work and set this one before Crystal Skull so that they never even have to aknowledge "Mutt". It's the only way. Just pretend he never happened. They set the precedent in Temple, so it's okay to skip back to a time period. <br /><br />3)There's some mystical curse on the Indy series that only the odd movies will be good (I love 1 and 3, don't like 2 as much, LOATHED 4 with a fiery passion). <br /><br />It could happen....<br /><br />(inconsolable crying) <img src='http://www.firstshowing.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </div>

That appears to be the case with the Indy flicks. <br /><br />Raiders? Awesome. Doom? Be honest, as iconic as some of the images were, the flick was pretty weak. Last Crusade? Not as awesome as Raiders, but awesome. Crystal Skull? Like Doom, overall weak, but still had some decent moments (not many, but there were a few).<br /><br />So a fifth installment has to fall into the awesome camp. Right?<br /><br />And honestly, Shia wasn't that bad. The way his character was introduced to the series, however, was horrible. So if we forget Skull, and let these characters just get on with it, we may be okay.</div>

The story would need to be a little more grounded in reality, too, please.

So in keeping with the sort of ludicrous twists seen in the source material, I don't see why it couldn't transpire, as I suggested at #10, that Connery is just missing, presumed dead, or something similar. Then son and grandson could go off in search of him! <br /><br />Connery only refused to come out of retirement for the fourth film because the part was little more than a cameo (I'd imagine Jim Broadbent's character was originally supposed to be Indy's dad, before the rewrite) - if it was something substantial I can see him making this his final movie.<br /><br />Oh and #19? The thing is, the first film is a classic even without the rose-tinted spectacles of nostalgia. The third one is brilliant too, and even the second one seems like a masterpiece compared with most adventure movies of the last couple of decades. That's why people were upset with the fourth film - it was nowhere near the level of the original trilogy, although I still liked it despite its faults.</div>

Are you retarded? It's the 1950's! The Nazis had been out of power for ten years.<br /><br /><br />#34 How can you "skip a time period" when he's so obviously OLD? Anyway, "Temple of Doom" didn't skip a time period----it was set like three years before "Raiders".</div>

Granted, the trilogy could have been left alone, and probably should have. <br />     However, it may be important to remember that Temple of Doom was trashed by critics when it first came out, while Raiders and Crusade were highly praised. Twenty years later, Temple of Doom is considered one of the more adventurous of the films.<br />    What really excites me is that the first and third films, which were Steven Spielberg's ideas, were considered excellent, while the second and fourth films, which were both spawned by George Lucas, have been trashed upon their release. <br />     It sounds like Spielberg is in charge of this movie, therefore I have great faith and much excitement at the idea that this pattern may continue and we may have a noteworthy and possibly legendary adventure in the works.<br /><br />I have to say, though, I would LOVE to see Shia La Beouf get kicked in the face by the actor who played Short Round. Just as I was pleased that they refused to allow the fedora to touch his head.</div>

I will admit I hated it when I saw it in the theaters.  But 14+ months later, I actually enjoyed it more the 2nd time through.  It wasn't even close to as good as the first 3, but I was also a young kid when I saw those (not in the theater, I was 6 when The Last Crusade was released.)  I'm 26 now, and my movie tastes have changed.  If you take it as a fun movie with an old friend and not an Oscar contender, its great fun.  Stupid and over the top in parts, but who cares...  It's an Indiana Jones movie, not A Clockwork Orange.</div>

I for one hadn't seen it until it showed recently on tv and found the DVD shortly afterwards and I haven't been able to stop watching it, I watch it just about everyday. I like the character Mutt and think Shia was great at playing But I hope the storyline is a bit better than before and not so predictable. It would be kinda cool if Mutt got hurt somewhere during the adventure or kidnapped, I like it when things like that happen and you get a sence of passion. If you've watched the special features then you'll knopw that it had to be made with some stuff from the past and some for those who are just introduced to Indiana Jones, you know the next generation who might like it but more modern, any way I enjoyed it and give it a thumbs up.</div>

Anyone else noticing a trend? First trilogy is great. Than he tries to make more movies 20 years later and they suck....hmmmmm where has he done this before? Lucas' problem is that he won't use any of his ideas to start up new franchises, he's so scared that if he did something new it would fail so instead he spends all of his time on just the two.</div>

If they can take more from that and add it to the next movie (better, more coherent plot and characters) and less overwrought CGI and cliches carried over from the trilogy, it could be something great.  The last movie was lazy film making.  You could feel they had to get that project out of the way so they could get on to something more important.</div>

A 25 year wait, then this? Cruel.......very cruel. Tarzan, Aliens? What's next, Mutt playing Indy?!  "The Librarian" TV Movie was more intriguing than prt 4.

Lucas, just write the scrip,.. umm you can, ...just get the actors to....forget it, please go away!<br />2). Mutt can be in it as long as he's as quiet as Jar Jar Binks was in "Sith"!<br />3). The "Meguffin"(?) should be Earth bound with forgotten artifacts with a touch of superstition.<br />One that people have put absolute faith in. Like the lost city of Atlantis, or the stone from Delphi that Cronus (Zeus' father) vomited up thinking it was a child when eating it. Wow, that was violent...or the spear of destiny.

It has all of Lucas' and Spielberg's best ideas.  They are great movies, although I think the Father/Son theme in all of George Lucas' films, has run its course.  I like the recent trend of rebooting franchises and think, with the right leading character, it could be huge.  The only thing I really didn't like about KOTCS was the 'Inter-dimensional Beings' and the 'space between spaces'.  I could suspend my disbelief, accept the absurdity of religious myths in the first three movies, but this was just a really bad idea.  The first three movies were based on well known religious myths and legends and this is where the object should remain, in a like realm.</div>

That could happen in an Indy universe so I overlooked it. In any case......it's an Indy film. At least we have four now. We got to see a new one in the theater. That's a good thing.</div>

You can't expect to hit gold so many times in a row, eventually there's gonna be a letdown. Was the "fridge" thing any worse than the overuse of Spielberg reaction shots of smiling faces? And-gasp- KIDS! loads of kids running around at the end of 2. Okay for E.T., not I.J. However,I would definately approve of a 5 or even a 6 if it kept Adam Sandler and Will Ferral off the screen for a while(and all the re and re-remakes of old movies). Was Lucas really the problem with 5?</div>

Even Stephen Hawking (the smartest person in the world) said according to Mathematics...Aliens HAVE to be real. Watch his special that was released recently on the Alien theory and your head will explode. The fact that you accept stupid religious things like "The Arc of the Covenent" sucking off people's skin and "The Holy Grail" giving eternal life before blowing someone to bones against a wall but not "Aliens" is utter ridiculousness. <br /><br />Sounds like most people are just tools and going along (as usual, no surprise there) with what the popular critics say and buying into it without forming their own opinions. 4's storyline and storytelling was no different than the other three films. They have a strict formula --- all 4 of them. Saying some magical rocks or a magical chest or a magical grail is any different than a magic transdimensional artifact is right along where Indiana Jones' story telling is all about. Its meant to introduce the theories and ideas of something that could possibly be real and possibly really happened. <br /><br />Get the hell over yourselves. If you didn't like the fourth film then you aren't a true Indy fan. The acting was great, the storytelling was exciting and interesting and the introduction/reintroduction of some of the characters was ...heart warming. The ONLY complaint I had about 4 was the Monkey's CGI, the Gopher's CGI. They were pointless. <br /><br />The movies are meant to be fun and are meant to keep you excited. Each movie as well opens the storyline up more and more and each so far have put Indy in a position where he learns and changes or has to adapt. Embrace the adventure and quit expecting movies to change your fucking lives. They are entertainment.  <br /><br /><br />Nate Fernandes<br /><br />(neonayon@yahoo.com)</div>
