Well, assuming they've watched five minutes of television, they know
*everyone* is portrayed unrealistically.

&gt; &gt;  This is your chance to give honest, considered feedback to the
&gt; &gt;network programmers and provide the critical insight that
&gt; &gt;right-wingers, the Christian Coalition, and &quot;Family Values&quot; (whose

Not all interest groups, right- or left- or middle-wing, are created equal.
The NEA isn't PETA, and Citizens Against Government Waste isn't Operation
Rescue.  Outside of the acknowledged fringe groups, I think you have to
analyze statements about television programming on their own merits, not on
ad hominem.  Of course these groups are biased.  So are you.  So am I.

There is also a note at the end from John Donvan about Ali Kadan Rabaia, a producer for ABC News who died of a heart attack.

Subject  NIGHTLINE; Supply and Demand 

TONIGHT'S SUBJECT: Scarce resources and high demand are always a recipe
for tension, sometimes war. Diamonds, for instance, have caused nothing
but misery in some of the African nations where they're mined. But when
the resource is a human heart and the demand comes from a cross-section of
Americans, including prisoners, you begin to appreciate the ethical
minefield. This is truly life and death decision-making.

----

There are some 4,000 Americans on a national list for a heart transplant. 
About 700 die each year waiting for one. When a California prison inmate
recently received a heart, you can only imagine the torrent of outrage on
radio call-in shows. But the Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear
that the law is with the prisoner. Authorities are mandated to take care
of their inmates, whatever medical care is necessary. And the decision as
to who gets a transplanted heart is a function of medical need, not social
worth.

What's at the center of the outrage is not so much that a prisoner is
getting a heart and an upstanding citizen with no criminal record is not. 
It's simply that prisoners are guaranteed health care in this country, but
there are no universal health services for those who don't live behind
bars.

ABC Correspondent Judy Muller is our guide tonight through the complex
ethical dilemma of heart transplants. Chris Bury will discuss this
emotional issue with professionals who must think about the consequences
of transplant policies or who, indeed, must make the life and death
decisions.

A footnote from last night's broadcast on journalists under fire in war
zones. Shortly after the program aired, we learned again what a dangerous
business it is to be a war correspondent. An Italian photographer was
killed by machine gun fire from an Israeli tank in Ramallah early this
morning. Also in the West Bank, a French photographer was injured by
shrapnel and an Egyptian journalist's car came under fire. Fortunately, he
was wearing a flak jacket and escaped serious injury.

And a final, sad note from NIGHTLINE Correspondent John Donvan about a
friend and colleague, whom we lost last night at age 44. Ali Kadan Rabaia,
a Palestinian-Israeli, who worked as a producer for ABC News for 19 years,
died of a heart attack. He was the first Palestinian to join an
all-Israeli local staff for ABC.
---- 

One of the parts of this job that rarely shows through in what gets on the
air is how much we reporters, particularly we American reporters overseas,
rely on other people to help us understand the world. Ali was one of those
people for me. I will never forget the day we met, 19 years ago. He worked
in a place called the Palestine Press Service, which has been set up to
try to put out a Palestinian account of news at a time when - as hard as
it is to fathom now - their side of the story rarely got told.  I was
younger, much greener, and, when I walked into the PPS office to begin my
reporting career in the Middle East, not taken very seriously by the men
there. I was an American, and they thought we American reporters were
hopelessly pro-Israel, and they more or less sent the message that I
should take a hike. At that point a skinny, curly-haired guy, easily the
youngest person in the building, walked into the room and saw what was
happening. It was Ali. He turned to the others and said, �Hey, this guy
wants to hear us out. Let�s show him some courtesy. Let�s take that
seriously.� And so Ali and I talked. And talked. Over days and weeks. On
long car rides to Gaza. Over many cups of coffee. He made his side of the
story real to me, and human, in all its complexities. That was a gift to
me I can never lose. Thank you, Ali.

Too often the people who make things happen in the field for a news
organization and put themselves in harm's way don't get the credit they
deserve.  It's always unfortunate that it takes a death to trigger the
kind of tributes people should hear when they are alive.  But that is the
way we are.

From the NOW release:


&gt; Participate in the Nationals Organization for Women's annual media
&gt; campaign, Watch Out. Listen Up., and you'll have the opportunity to
&gt; report on how (un)realistically women and minorities are portrayed in
&gt; primetime television, as well as remarking about violence, sexual
&gt; exploitation and other top media concerns. 

Because of course all men and especially non-minority men are so 
realistically portrayed.


&gt; This is your chance to give 
&gt; honest, considered feedback to the network programmers and provide the
&gt; critical insight that right-wingers, the Christian Coalition, and
&gt; &quot;Family Values&quot; (whose family values?)advocates cannot offer.

This is really insulting.  Just because these groups likely have a different 
opinion than NOW (and probably me too), there is no reason to look down their 
noses at them.


&gt; San Francisco NOW has been assigned to critique Dawson's Creek, this
&gt; Wednesday, March 3, from 8 to 10 p.m. 

Oh, now here is a show where everyone is portrayed realistically.  Good 
grief, will the chapter that has &quot;Smallville&quot; complain that only Clark, a 
white male, has super powers?  Will they complain about how unrealistic that 
is?


&gt; Across the country, teams of feminist TV viewers will review all the
&gt; primetime programming on 6 broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, NBC, WB and
&gt; UPN). 

NBC, CBS, NBC, WB and UPN add up to 5, even if you count NBC twice.  ABC and 
FOX I guess aren't broadcast networks.

That may explain the Letterman decision.

Sorry -- in a snarky mood today.  As a professional woman, I'm sorry to see 
these folks spend their time on useful things rather than worrying about 
whether &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; (&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; for heaven's sake!) is PC enough.  
Worry about whether women are in on the creation of these shows, are making 
proper strides in the corporate and production end, etc.

&gt;TOM GREEN'S BACK ON MTV!
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Tom Green's Subway Monkey Hour&quot; Special Airs on MTV
&gt;March 27th at 10PM (ET/PT)
&gt;
&gt;Santa Monica, CA, March 13, 2002 -- There will be tons of monkey business as
&gt;MTV airs &quot;Tom Green's Subway Monkey Hour&quot; on March 27 at 10PM (ET/PT).
&gt;
&gt;In this one hour special, Tom Green heads to Japan to visit its many
&gt;attractions and stir up some trouble with his unpredictable and zany antics.
&gt;Language is no barrier as Green visits a monkey zoo in Nikko dressed in a
&gt;godzilla costume, plays with Japanese snow monkeys on the side of the road
&gt;outside Nagano, impersonates Elvis Presley in front of a sacred temple in
&gt;Kyoto, and hangs out with a used panty salesman in Tokyo, just to mention a
&gt;few of the highlights from the trip.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The Japanese have a great sense of humor,&quot; says Tom Green.  &quot;But I don't
&gt;think they're going to invite us back.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;MTV plans to air two additional Tom Green specials in the upcoming months
&gt;(TBD).
&gt;
&gt;The Tom Green Show debuted on the Canadian public access channel, Rogers
&gt;Community TV in 1994.  The Tom Green Show debuted on MTV on January 25,
&gt;1999.  Tom Green's approach to comedy is unpredictable, outrageously weird
&gt;and always hilarious.  Nobody else in television can confuse and bewilder
&gt;innocent passers-by quite like Tom Green.
&gt;
&gt;MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom International Inc. (NYSE: VIA, VIA.B), owns
&gt;and operates the following television programming services -- MTV:  Music
&gt;Television, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite, TV LAND, TNN, CMT and the

&gt;all of which are trademarks of MTV Networks.  MTV Networks also has
&gt;licensing agreements, joint ventures, and syndication deals whereby all of
&gt;its programming services can be seen worldwide.  In addition, MTV Networks
&gt;operates The MTVi Group and Nickelodeon Online, a portfolio of leading

Meet the guy Liza Minnelli is marrying on NBC &quot;Dateline&quot; (8 PM), 
still somehow considered part of the news division. 

Taxes are done tonight on ABC &quot;According to Jim&quot; (8:30), fitting 
because I'd rather do mine than watch &quot;According to Jim.&quot; 

If you wished the teams from CBS' &quot;Amazing Race 2&quot; (9 PM) would just 
jump off a cliff, your wish has come true. They're hang gliding off 
the Iguacu waterfalls on the Brazilian-Argentinean border. 

FOX presents &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot; (9 PM) with one of the Backstreet 
Boys performing the Star Spangled Banner -- the only time any actual 
stars are involved in the event.  

In the very first Court TV TV-movie (I wonder why) &quot;Guilt by 
Association&quot; (9 PM) it's Mercedes Ruehl's boyfriend is selling drugs, 
but she winds up in prison as well. Will she get her kids back? And 
perhaps even their fronts too. It's a minimum sentence of 3 years to 
Lifetime. 

Wrestling's buff bimbos compete in the Bahamas to be magazine 
covergurls in UPN's &quot;WWF Divas&quot; (9 PM).

No booze no smoking, what kind of anniversary party is that on 
ABC's &quot;The Job&quot; (9:30 PM)? Answer: not a very long one. 

Why aren't real forensic scientists as attractive as the ones 
on &quot;CSI?&quot;  Find out on CBS &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; (10 PM).

ABC's &quot;20/20 Downtown&quot; (10 PM) explores the most downtrodden minority 
in America: divorced white men. Plus, a very thin former Miss Teen 
Arizona, and MURDER!

You'd think after all this time, Comedy Central's &quot;South Park&quot; (10 
PM) would have done a skiing episode by now. 


UNNECESSARY GUEST STAR PATROL 
ABC's &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; (9 PM) &quot;Legally Blonde's&quot; Jessica 
Cauffiel. Plot: Drew gets a new boss, since bit players can no longer 
play Murphy Brown's secretary. 

LATE PATROL
Jay has Jennifer Connelly, John Leguizamo and John Mayer. 
Dave has Rene Russo and the Chieftains.
Zach has Sarah Silverman and more with Ice Cube.

&gt;&gt; Asked for his take on the David Letterman vs. Koppel story, he ripped 
&gt; &gt;into Ted Koppel, calling the flap last week over Nightline's possible 
&gt; &gt;exit from ABC &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and adding that he thought cable 
&gt; &gt;had &quot;overtaken&quot; Koppel on the news front.

Well, O'Reilly and Matthews can snipe at Koppel all they want. Nightline has 
more  actual news in a day than either of theirs does in a week. They're the 
opinion page, not the Front page.

&gt;As a professional woman, I'm sorry to see 
&gt; these folks spend their time on useful things rather than worrying 
about 
&gt; whether &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; (&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; for heaven's sake!) is 
PC enough.  
&gt; Worry about whether women are in on the creation of these shows, 
are making 
&gt; proper strides in the corporate and production end, etc.

Am I the only one who finds it ironic that an organization that 
disdains stereotyping and drawing generalizations about all women 
from few examples wants to have its members view _one_ episode from 
one show and draw conclusions about the status of women on TV?

Has anyone here ever heard of the Shop America Network?

Just got an Email from a dear friend in Orlando. Her brother and his 
wife in Pennsylvania have a small business and have been approached 
by said &quot;Shop America Network&quot; to market their products. Apparently 
they are being asked to sign up for production costs on a commercial 
(or segment on a home-shopping-type network). Sounds like they are 
being pressured to make a decision, so Cathy asked me, being in 
broadcasting, if I have heard of them.

Trouble is, I haven't. A Google search yields nothing, nor any 
mention in Google Groups. They are reportedly in Miramar, Florida. 
Zap2It doesn't list them as a cable station. Of course, the brother 
should be able to give me SOME idea of what they've said about 
themselves, such as whether they're broadcast, cable, or satellite, 
or (as I now suspect) some sort of &quot;unwired network,&quot; really just a 
marketing middleman who buys unused cable time or something.

My advice, certainly barring any tangible evidence that these guys 
exist, is to hold off on the deal until a whole shopping list of 
information (market penetration, ratings, etc.) can be established, 
along with how long these guys have been in business and a list of 
existing clients.

If anyone has any information, please let me know. Thanks!

Actresses' careers are much shorter than actors.  Once they are 
finished playing &quot;the daughter&quot; &quot;the girlfriend&quot; or &quot;the lover&quot; they 
often have to move on to &quot;the wife&quot; and &quot;the mother&quot;.  Actresses have 
to respond by keeping their bodies in outstanding shape.

I saw Marisa Tomei on &quot;Conan&quot; last week and she does look great for 
age 37.

I certainly aplogize if my use of the phrase was offensive. What age does the 
phrase &quot;of a certain age&quot; traditionally refer to? What I meant was that I 
thought it was somewhat remarkable that women in thier late 30's - early 40's 
seemed to be dressing for late night talk shows in a fashion one might expect 
more from younger actresses. I did not mean to imply that women in their 
30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's etc. can't be sexy as hell. I guess I should 
have waited to make the observation until I saw Dame Judy showing up on Dave 
flashing some high thigh....

I've gotten a lot of spam from them or someone like them. As far as I can 
tell, they're buying up unused cable and broadcast time to run 
infomercials.  It's possible they have a link to one of the satellite 
shopping channels that get some airplay overnights on some broadcast &amp; 
cable stations but this particular one doesn't look like one of the ones 
I've seen listed on my sat lists.

That's just good advice anyway.  Every ad sales weasel, er, rep I've ever 
dealt with has been more happy to give you all sorts of numbers.  You may 
not be able to make heads or tails of them (they generally hope you won't) 
but you have something to back up what the sales people are saying at the 
very least.  My philosophy has always been to give the pressure sales 
people a firm &quot;no&quot;.

That loosely confirms (as you're not sure) my suspicions. The inexperienced 
client is hearing &quot;Network&quot; and thinking -- a national network of affiliated 
stations. Some coworkers went to work for one of these &quot;unwired networks&quot; and 
vigorously pursued my coming to work for them. The whole operation just 
rubbed me the wrong way, and I said no to a lot more money. Turns out it was 
the smart move,  as I would apparently be unemployed right now. (I should say 
that their goal was to provide complete post-analysis of schedules to 
clients. Don't know whether they achieved that. I just know I didn't build 
it.)

I just hope my friend talks to her brother before he signs anything!

They have a website:

<a href="http://www.shopamericanetwork.com">http://www.shopamericanetwork.com</a>

It looks like they are selling some of the direct response stuff you see on 
cable -- the turbie twist, oxyclean, etc.

Has anyone else noticed that at least three current commercials (Burger
King, Pepsi, and some foreign car -- I think it's either BMW or Mercedes)
are using the &quot;traveling through time&quot; technique, where they show a
montage of scenes from different eras. I wonder why this is so popular on
Madison Avenue all of a sudden.

Will anyone else admit to watching celebrity boxing on FOX tonight? (Hey,
it was previewed in the New York Times!) We had a little gathering at our
neighbors' and I'll admit that it was sort of a fun show, if you're into
VERY guilty pleasures. I'm sure Tonya vs. Amy Fisher would have been so
much better, though.

My fave new show: &quot;The Osbournes&quot; on MTV! It's the first time I've watched
MTV since that yucky Jesse Camp won the VJ contest and I decided to swear
off it for life (which turned out to be more like 5 years).

And I definitely want more of &quot;Celebrity X-Ray Challenge.&quot;

Ah, the ads I see during every break on BBC America.  I'd ask for response 
rates.  If they're doing direct response, then they should have some 
numbers to show their clients.

&quot;As we pointed out earlier, going to cable would be a huge comedown 
for Koppel. &quot;Nightline&quot; would simply cease to exist in the 15 percent 
of U.S. households that don't have cable......  Public television, by 
contrast, covers the entire nation.&quot;

Sorry, PBS's OTA coverage only hovers around 70%. PBS gets their 
magical '99.9% of tv households' number with the aid of Cable and 
Satellite coverage-- pay services. Those 'must carry' laws and local 
franchise agreements sure make it very easy for a cable system to 
load up on low-cost programming!

People that &quot;don't have cable&quot; or &quot;just watch PBS&quot; are generally 
located in major metroplitan areas where OTA signals for all channels 
are strong, and there are PBSs-a-plenty (NYC, LA, DC).

No, Pepsi does not own Burger King; the British company Diageo (DEO) 
does, although they are looking to sell it.

Pepsi used to own fast-food restaurants, but that business was spun 
off into Tricon Global (YUM). They own KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, 
and are buying Long John Silver's and A&amp;W.

None of which has anything to do with TV, but you asked for it.

Nobody asked, but allow me to vent: I am already tired of the new ad 
for Ontario tourism with various Canadians (including the requisite 
Mountie and hockey player) singing some Shania Twain song. This 
commercial is actually having the opposite effect upon me; I'm losing 
my goodwill toward Ontario and its occupants thanks to this annoying 
spot.

HBO's REAL SPORTS WITH BRYANT GUMBEL returns Monday, March 18 at 10:05 p.m
ET/PT and 9:05 p.m. CT with a compelling feature on Curt and Shonda Schilling.

Plus a profile of 28-year-old college basketball player Lee Benson, who has
re-ignited his dream of playing pro ball after a long prision stint; and a
look at the world of junior figure skaters, who dream of Olympic glory.

      2001 may have been a storybook season for Curt on the field, as he
earned co-MVP honors in leading the Diamondbacks to a thrilling World Series
triumph, but real life experiences tested his family --among the hurdles was
his wife battling skin cancer.

Among the points covered in the HBO interview are:

*Shonda Schilling, a lifelong sun worshipper, had developed stage two
melanoma, a curable but dangerous skin cancer.  She's been treated for a year
and is now in remission.  The entire Schilling family, which resides in
Phoenix,  now takes precautions:  Shonda wears special clothing the sun can't
penetrate and the couple's three children --who are four times as likely to
develop skin cancer - wear sunblock every day and do not play outside until
after sundown.

*HBO's Jim Lampley:  &quot;If you're a skin cancer patient, and you're gonna list
all of the 50 states in order of priority as to where the beneficial and
useful places to live, Arizona might be number 50, right?&quot;

Curt Schilling: &quot;Fifty-one, probably.&quot;

&gt; Will anyone else admit to watching celebrity boxing on FOX tonight? (Hey,
&gt; it was previewed in the New York Times!) We had a little gathering at our
&gt; neighbors' and I'll admit that it was sort of a fun show, if you're into
&gt; VERY guilty pleasures. I'm sure Tonya vs. Amy Fisher would have been so
&gt; much better, though.

I'll admit it...^_^  

It was tacky, cheesy, and a sure sign of the downfall of our civilization.  
But, it was still fun to watch--I love the nicknames they all had (what was 
it, Danny &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Bonaduce?)  But, watching that last &quot;bout&quot; between 
Tonya Harding and an obviously very reluctant Paula Jones, I couldn't help 
thinking back to a stunt George Foreman was in back in the '70s, where he 
fought 5 separate fighters over 15 rounds.  At one point, Foreman is 
whaling away on some poor kid who got roped into fighting him, and Howard 
Cosell (ABC carried the event) says something along the lines of &quot;I wonder 
if this referee understands that he is constructing an advertisement to the 
abolition of the very sport of which he is a part?&quot;  

BTW, anyone else notice the director of Celebrity Boxing was Sandy 
Grossman?  (As in, Sandy Grossman, the legendary sports director who's been 
paired with Summerall and Madden forever, including IIRC back when they 
were all at CBS.)

Not to nitpick but there has always been a free PBS signal on satellite.

Thanks! I feel stupid for not finding that site myself --  but wonder why a Google search didn't come up with it. 

Yes, I've seen these commercials all the time.

Thanks, everyone, for your help and comments.

The emails seem to be returning to normal:


Subject  NIGHTLINE: Sins of the Fathers 

TONIGHT'S SUBJECT: As a young boy, he says he was molested by a priest,
and then by a second priest. When he turned to a third for counseling, he
was molested yet again. And yet he went ahead with his own plan to become
a priest himself, until he could not take it any longer. We'll hear from
one of the victims of the growing scandal, and also look at how the
Catholic Church is going to raise the money needed to pay the settlements
in these cases.

----

In a scandal such as the one currently engulfing the Catholic Church, it
is rare to hear from the victims. The crimes usually occur when they are
young children. Many don't ever want to come forward out of shame and
embarrassment, and the sheer difficulty of talking openly about something
like this. If they ever do come forward, it is usually much later in life.
That's been the situation for the man you will meet tonight. I outlined
his story above. It was his coming forward that finally led to the
resignation last week of a Bishop in Florida, the third of the priests who
had molested him.

At the same time, the Catholic Church has been settling many of the
complaints against it. But those settlements, just in the Boston
archdiocese, may run close to a hundred million dollars. Where will that
money come from? The church may sell some of the real estate it owns, and
there are some who are trying to raise money to help pay those costs, but
even that is controversial. Others say that it is wrong to help raise that
money, that the church should be punished for what has occurred. As in
every aspect of this story that continues to grow, nothing is simple.

ABC News correspondent Ron Claiborne has been covering this story from the
beginning, and he'll have two reports on tonight. But how has all of this
affected priests who are entirely innocent? Some have talked about seeing
the suspicion in the eyes of their parishioners. The Catholic Church was
already having trouble recruiting new priests, this can only have made
that more difficult. Chris Bury will sit down with a group of seminary
students to get their thoughts about the scandal, and the challenges that
they will face as new priests in the wake of this.

&gt; Will anyone else admit to watching celebrity boxing on FOX tonight? 
(Hey,
&gt; it was previewed in the New York Times!) We had a little gathering 
at our
&gt; neighbors' and I'll admit that it was sort of a fun show, if you're 
into
&gt; VERY guilty pleasures. I'm sure Tonya vs. Amy Fisher would have 
been so
&gt; much better, though.
&gt; 

I couldn't believe I watched it, but yes, I watched it. And it was 
fun.
Tonya Harding should have cleaned the floor with Paula Jones. Instead 
she actually ending up improving Paula Jones' reputation. I guess 
Tonya only does well when someone else does the hitting. Maybe 
they'll get her back when Amy Fisher gets off probation.
Bi-Polar also made Todd Bridges look like a bad dude. I would have 
rather seen Danny Bonaduce box a transvestite prostitute.
I wonder how long until FOX goes to the old ESPN formula of putting a 
tomato can up against a bruiser? Abe Vigoda against Dolph Lungren? 
Richard Simmons against Howie Long? Paul Shaffer against Mr. T? Tom 
Heald against Tom Shales?

Oh, Paul could take him out with his rotating Leslie, his drawbars and his
third harmonic percussion.

&gt; Tom

Nah, Tom Heald against Lisa DeMoraes.  Heald would beat the old fat guy
easily.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My fave new show: &quot;The Osbournes&quot; on MTV! It's the first time 
I've watched MTV since that yucky Jesse Camp won the VJ contest and I 
decided to swear off it for life (which turned out to be more like 5 
years).&lt;&lt;&lt;


This show is absolutely hysterical. There is some sadness is seeing 
just how burnt Ozzy is (he looks like he can barely walk), but this 
family provides more laughs in 30 minutes than anything else on TV.

by 
&gt; contrast, covers the entire nation.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, PBS's OTA coverage only hovers around 70%. PBS gets their 
&gt; magical '99.9% of tv households' number with the aid of Cable and 
&gt; Satellite coverage-- pay services. Those 'must carry' laws and 
local 
&gt; franchise agreements sure make it very easy for a cable system to 
&gt; load up on low-cost programming!
&gt; 
&gt; People that &quot;don't have cable&quot; or &quot;just watch PBS&quot; are generally 
&gt; located in major metroplitan areas where OTA signals for all 
channels 
&gt; are strong, and there are PBSs-a-plenty (NYC, LA, DC).

oh i think its more than 70%, when you stop to consider the upper-
echelon cable channels (espn, tbs, cnn) reach more than 70% without 
the aid of any OTA coverage, and that many states like nebraska and 
iowa have statewide ETV networks that have placed transmitters even 
in the most barren of places to assure statewide OTA coverage to 
nearly everyone.  pbs is not at the 98-99% reach of the major 
broadcast networks but i have to think it is around the 90% of a wb

&gt;as Pepsi owns Burger King (doesn't it?), so it seems like it must actually
&gt;be intentional that those ads are so similar.

Uh... no. KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. 

And BK is celebrating an anniversary, thus the time travel. Pepsi was going 
more for a demographics extention. 

The WHOPPER(R) Turns 45
  
Burger King Corporation Celebrates 45 years of the great taste of the &quot;HAVE 
IT YOUR WAY(R)&quot; Flame-Broiled WHOPPER(R) Sandwich with A New Leadership   
Team Focused on Providing New Quality Products and Great Service, New Ads   
featuring Shaquille O'Neal, and A New Tagline  ...  &quot; @BK YOU GOT IT!(TM)&quot; 

MIAMI, Feb. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- The WHOPPER(R), America's favorite burger, 
celebrates its 45th anniversary on Monday, March 4th.   Burger King 
Corporation and its franchisees will mark the anniversary by introducing 14 
new products, several new promotions, new anniversary advertising featuring 
Shaquille O'Neal and a new tagline, &quot;@BKYOU GOT IT!(TM)&quot;

&quot;The WHOPPER(R) sandwich is the hallmark of our brand and one of our 
strategic assets,&quot; said John H. Dasburg, chairman, CEO and president, Burger 
King Corporation.  &quot;We want to satisfy the millions of WHOPPER(R) fans 
everyday.  Each and every WHOPPER(R) is made with fresh red ripe tomatoes, 
fresh crisp lettuce, old-fashioned dill pickles and quality mayonnaise. 

&quot;As an expression of the pride we take in every WHOPPER(R), we are wrapping 
each one in a special new anniversary gold foil that also helps to keep the 
burger extra hot, fresh and juicy,&quot; Dasburg said. 

Burger King Corporation introduced the WHOPPER(R) at the first BURGER KING(R) 
restaurant in Miami in 1957 and immediately erected a sign proclaiming the 
restaurant the &quot;HOME OF THE WHOPPER(R).&quot;  The WHOPPER(R), known for its size 
and distinctive flame-broiled flavor (preferred by a majority of Americans), 
became an instant hit.  Today, BURGER KING(R) restaurants sell more than 4.5 
million WHOPPER(R) sandwiches around the world each and every day. 

With its nine special ingredients (sesame seed crown, beef patty, pickles, 
ketchup, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo and bun heel) and three optional 
ingredients (cheese, bacon and mustard), Burger King Corporation calculates 
that there are 1,024 ways to order and enjoy a WHOPPER(R).  The variety of 
ways to have a WHOPPER(R) sandwich prompted the company to introduce the 
&quot;HAVE IT YOUR WAY(R)&quot; advertising tagline in the mid-seventies with a jingle 
that started with the lyrics, &quot;Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce, special 
orders don't upset us ... .&quot;  Over the years, Burger King Corporation has 
reprised this popular tune in its advertising several times. 

BURGER KING(R) Launches 14 New Products and New Advertising   

To honor and celebrate the 45th anniversary of the WHOPPER(R), BURGER KING(R) 
is unveiling 14 new products, new advertising and a new tagline --  &quot;@ BKYOU 
GOT IT!(TM)&quot; designed to boldly and emphatically showcase that BURGER KING(R) 
restaurants deliver great tastes your way. 

&quot;@ BKYOU GOT IT!(TM)&quot; reinforces our 'HAVE IT YOUR WAY(R)' heritage,&quot; notes 
Christopher E. Clouser, executive vice president and chief global marketing 
officer.   &quot;It commits to our customers that at BURGER KING(R), it's always 
your food, your experience, your way.&quot; 

The first television advertisement in the series features WHOPPER(R) lover 
Shaquille O'Neal as he walks through the last 45 years on his way to get a 
WHOPPER(R).  The ad, which breaks this Sunday, March 3rd, will be the first 
to use the new tagline and will introduce a new BURGER KING(R) song. 

Other advertisements that are scheduled to air in early March include &quot;3-D 
WHOPPER(R)&quot; in which a 1950s theater audience wearing 3-D glasses is enticed 
by an enormous WHOPPER(R) flying over their heads.   An ad called &quot;Space&quot; 
works on the premise that all broadcasts continue into space indefinitely.  
As a space ship travels past planets, stars and nebula, we hear various 
reminders of past BURGER KING(R) commercials.   The music makes the crew 
hungry for a WHOPPER(R) sandwich and they return to earth at warp speed to a 
BURGER KING(R) restaurant. 

Burger King Corporation plans additional television, print and radio 
advertising and sponsorships to feature BURGER KING(R) people and the new and 
improved products over the next several months. 

The new products include the BK VEGGIE(TM) Burger, the first veggie burger to 
be offered nationally, which will debut March 18th, and a new flame-broiled 
chicken sandwich as the first ever line extension for the popular WHOPPER(R) 
sandwich. 

&quot;Our customers told us they want a premium flame-broiled chicken sandwich 
worthy of the name WHOPPER(R).  On April 1, 2002, BURGER KING(R) will give 
them what they want with the CHICKEN WHOPPER(TM) and the CHICKEN WHOPPER 
JR(TM),&quot; Clouser said.  The CHICKEN WHOPPER(TM) will be a large flame-broiled 
chicken breast sandwich. 

Also in June, Burger King Corporation will add two BK BACK PORCH(TM) 
Grillers, a brand new line of premium hamburger sandwiches. 

&quot;The BK BACK PORCH(TM) Grillers taste like a burger you would make in your 
own backyard,&quot; Clouser said. 

Other products already in restaurants include the KING SUPREME(TM) with two 
patties and a special sauce created to enhance the flavor of the flame 
broiling, a BK 1/4 LB BURGER(TM), new onion rings with a zesty dipping sauce, 
a line of Old Fashioned Ice Cream Shakes, and a new EGG'WICH(TM) breakfast 
sandwich.  On March 18th, Burger King Corporation will add a Hot Fudge 
Brownie Royale and chocolate chip cookies to its menu.   In April, SHAKE 'EM 
UP(TM) fries, in which the customer adds cheese seasoning to a bag of fries 
and shakes to coat each fry, will be added. 

Burger King Corporation celebrates the WHOPPER(R) Anniversary in Miami and 
New York   

As a salute to the anniversary, Burger King Corporation will hold an 
anniversary celebration at BURGER KING(R) restaurant number one, near the 
site of the first BURGER KING(R) restaurant in Miami and the location where 
the first WHOPPER(R) was created.  Nancy McLamore, wife of co-founder the 
late Jim McLamore, and David Edgerton, co-founder, will join John Dasburg at 
the event. Immediately following the celebration, members of BK Cares, a 
group of Burger King Corporation employees who volunteer their time to 
improving the community, will make and serve 1,500 to 2,000 WHOPPER(R) 
sandwiches at Camillus House, Miami's homeless shelter. 

Burger King Corporation and its local Miami franchisees will also offer a 
special coupon in The Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald good for a ten percent 
discount on purchases made on the anniversary date of March 4th at 
participating BURGER KING(R) restaurants in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. 
Burger King Corporation will also offer a special key lime flavored Old 
Fashioned Ice Cream Shake available only on March 4th at BURGER KING(R) 
restaurant number one. 

In New York City, Burger King Corporation will erect its &quot;WHOPPER(R) 
Mountain&quot; in Grand Central Station and challenge anyone to climb to the top. 
The 26-foot high WHOPPER(R) replica is outfitted for safe climbing. 

&quot;Selected climbers who reaches the top of WHOPPER(R) Mountain will be awarded 
free WHOPPER(R) sandwiches for a year,&quot; Clouser said. 

Members of the Harlem Globetrotters will be on hand to celebrate the 
anniversary in New York.   Also during the day, Burger King Corporation and 
its franchisees and employees will deliver coupons for free WHOPPER(R) 
sandwiches to all of the New York area firemen and policemen in recognition 
of their valuable community service. 

&quot;The Burger King Corporation and its franchisees are proud to serve and honor 
these very deserving people,&quot; Dasburg said. 

New Leadership Team sets BURGER KING(R) on a new course   

Since joining Burger King Corporation last April from Northwest Airlines, 
John Dasburg has assembled a new leadership team, which has developed a new 
strategic direction for the company. 

&quot;Our strategy is straight-forward. Allocate our resources to deliver our 
'Customer Promise,' 'BURGER KING(R) is flame-broiled burgers, fries and soft 
drinks, at a good value served quickly and consistently by friendly people in 
clean surroundings',&quot; Dasburg said. 

For 60 days beginning March 4th, crews in BURGER KING(R) restaurants will 
sport a new uniform comprised of an apron and a special anniversary shirt. 

Burger King Corporation has also completed a series of strategic alliances 
with such powerhouse brands as AOL/Time Warner, DreamWorks, Nickelodeon and 
eBay.   These alliances will allow BURGER KING(R) to offer its customers 
promotions never before seen in the industry.   For example, BURGER KING(R), 
in partnership with eBay, has developed the first online points based loyalty 
program in the industry that will reward BURGER KING(R) customers with a 
variety of rewards for their BURGER KING(R) purchases. 

&quot;This BK 'frequent eater' program will roll out nationally in the near 
future,&quot; Clouser said. 

Earlier this week, Burger King Corporation launched a new feature-packed web 
site that will allow BURGER KING(R) to offer its customers additional 
entertainment opportunities and information about the company. 

In restaurants, Burger King Corporation and its franchisees are installing 
kitchens that use computer controlled holding bins to insure that all of the 
ingredients are kept as fresh as possible. 

&quot;This new kitchen dramatically improves the quality of our products,&quot; said 
Kim Lopdrup, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Burger 
King Corporation.   &quot;We will have the entire system converted to our new 
kitchen by June 30.&quot; 

Burger King Corporation and its franchisees are also revamping the drive- 
thru service with new menu boards, higher quality sound systems and an order 
confirmation screen that allows customers to confirm the accuracy of their 
order. 

Burger King Corporation also announced this week that it is once again 
recruiting new franchisees after a five-year period in which it was closed to 
new franchisees. 

&quot;This is a great company with great people as well as fabulous products. 
Burger King Corporation has an exciting, bright future,&quot; said Dasburg, &quot;and 
we welcome qualified franchisees with the right experience to help us grow.&quot;

The latest late night &quot;war&quot; gave Leno the opportunity to throw some 
Letterman jokes.
Just to name a few there was the grumpy joke on monday and then 
tuesday he went even further:(top ten) signs the taliban are 
DEPRESSED:stayed at CBS instead of going to ABC.
He even joked about going as a WEATHERMAN to Telemundo and on Dave 
sparing Ted Koppel's job.
Has anybody seen Leno that pissed?Does he see an opportunity to spice 
things up?So much for the good guy character,doesn't work for him 
anymore.

Dave did the Telemundo joke on Monday or Tuesday night.  Leno has
started doing Top 10 Lists?

I'd love to see Jay try to play hardball with NBC.  He might find out
very quickly just how replaceable he is.  Leno, at his best, is a good
standup comedian.  There are lots of good standup comedians.  Combine
that with the fact that The Tonight Show has proven itself to be more
than a one-man franchise and I think Leno better keep smiling and
playing the Eagle Scout.

Newsblues.com reports that Andrea Thompson has resigned from her evening
anchor position at CNN Headline News after less than a year with the
channel.  The web site claims that, according to &quot;insiders,&quot; the decision
was hers.  The former model and actress on &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; had
joined Headline News after a year's apprenticeship as a TV reporter in
Albuquerque, N.M., and was the star attraction in the channel's attempt to
remake itself to appeal to younger demographics.  Although Headline News'
ratings and demos have improved since the change last August, Thompson's
less-than-perfect performance as an anchor had been criticized and mocked by
many media critics.

By the way, Aaron, I tried to post something on the site, but it seems that
Blogger2 is also down.

I just heard from Bill Reed, general manager of the public television 
station serving Kansas City.  Bill is a 30-year veteran of ETV and 
spent many years at PBS HQ in Virginia, where among other things he 
developed PBS Video.

Bill said that 99.9 percent of TV households receive public 
television over the air.  The 70 percent figure he called &quot;completely 
wrong.&quot;

Interestingly, I grew up in one of the areas that is still part of 
the 0.1 percent.  But thanks to the digital conversion, Billings and 
the rest of Montana's major communities currently receiving PBS on 
cable will be served by an over-the-air signal beginning in 2003.


&gt;&quot;As we pointed out earlier, going to cable would be a huge comedown
&gt;for Koppel. &quot;Nightline&quot; would simply cease to exist in the 15 percent
&gt;of U.S. households that don't have cable......  Public television, by
&gt;contrast, covers the entire nation.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, PBS's OTA coverage only hovers around 70%. PBS gets their
&gt;magical '99.9% of tv households' number with the aid of Cable and
&gt;Satellite coverage-- pay services. Those 'must carry' laws and local
&gt;franchise agreements sure make it very easy for a cable system to
&gt;load up on low-cost programming!
&gt;
&gt;People that &quot;don't have cable&quot; or &quot;just watch PBS&quot; are generally
&gt;located in major metroplitan areas where OTA signals for all channels
&gt;are strong, and there are PBSs-a-plenty (NYC, LA, DC).

Ben, Ben, Ben ... that was the Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb fight, it was a 
standalone fight, and it was against Larry Holmes.  Cosell quit 
announcing after the bout:

&gt;Cosell (ABC carried the event) says something along the lines of &quot;I wonder
&gt;if this referee understands that he is constructing an advertisement to the
&gt;abolition of the very sport of which he is a part?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;BTW, anyone else notice the director of Celebrity Boxing was Sandy
&gt;Grossman?  (As in, Sandy Grossman, the legendary sports director who's been
&gt;paired with Summerall and Madden forever, including IIRC back when they
&gt;were all at CBS.)

NBC's &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (8:30) tries to make lemons out of lemonade. 
NBC will probably be a little sour on my mentioning this is the only 
new show on its lineup tonight. 

While PopStars are taking a rest The WB has a new mock 
group, &quot;SlipDog&quot; ready to get your teenage daughter all sweaty. &quot;My 
Guide to Becoming a Rock Star,&quot; (8 PM) naturally starts with the lead 
singer inviting his girlfriend into the group. Did somebody say Yoko?

Hmmm is there really enough dirt to fill an entire A&amp;E Biography on 
Marilyn Monroe (8 PM)? 

On CNN's Larry King Live, (9 PM) the host tries to get a few names 
out of Betty Ford. 

Originally scheduled for two separate hours, Diane Sawyer interviews 
Rosie O'Donnell tonight on &quot;PrimeTime Thursday (9 PM). Apparently a 
big secret is revealed. Can it be that Rosie's secretly dating Tom 
Cruise?


UNNECESSARY GUEST STAR PATROL 
The WB's Charmed (9 PM) Coolio. Plot: Phoebe's getting married. No 
not Friends, they're still a season away from falling back on that 
plotline. 

LATE PATROL
Zach has the cast of Sorority Boys.
Jay has Tom Green and Jewel. 
Conan has Wesley Snipes, William Shatner and Owen O'Neill.
Carson has Milla Jovovich and Mystikal.
The Daily Show has Bill O'Reilly.
Dave's a rerun with Andy Richter and Jake Johannsen (special time 
somewhere around 1 AM).

I have been thinking the same thing all day (I played hookey from work to

Enberg in particular went above and beyond the call. I wonder if there is any 
count of Dave spots last year vs this to get an objective comparison?

Since I was born in Sweden and have spent a lot of time there, I've always
gotten a kick out of the occasional mentions of Sweden on Letterman's show
-- anyone else remember &quot;Let's Look For Swedes&quot;? Last night's ep, though,
went above &amp; beyond that. For anyone who missed it, the readers of the
Swedish evening tabloid newspaper Aftonbladet nominated Dave for &quot;best
male TV personality of the year, non-Swedish,&quot; and Dave won! He spent at
least 10 minutes going on about this triumph; Paul Shaffer even had a
special song for the occasion (sung to the tune of ABBA's &quot;Dancing
Queen&quot;).

I decided to check out Aftonbladet's web site to see if there was any
mention of last night's show on their site, and there was indeed a brief
article. However, when I checked out the list of nominees, I think I
figured out why Dave was so happy:

David Letterman, Jay Leno, Martin Sheen.

So at least in Sweden, Dave's more popular than Jay ;)

I need to mention the nominees for non-Swedish female personality:

Jennifer Aniston, Calista Flockhart and--Oprah.

won one of these, Oprah, and you didn't!  *Now* are you going to call me?&quot;

God no kidding, Dave is now at $31.5 million annually, PLUS the money 
he makes from Worldwide Pants. Leno makes about $17 million a year, 
he must be pissed! It hasn't been answered yet.. is Leno now doing 
Top Ten Lists for cryin' out loud? He has stolen everything on his 
show anyways.

&gt; &gt; figured out why Dave was so happy:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; David Letterman, Jay Leno, Martin Sheen.

I was sure the Swedes would still have a fascination with German personality 
Constantin Papst star of &quot;Everyody Loves Gunther.&quot;

&gt; Bill said that 99.9 percent of TV households receive public 
&gt; television over the air.  The 70 percent figure he 
called &quot;completely 
&gt; wrong.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, I grew up in one of the areas that is still part of 
&gt; the 0.1 percent.  But thanks to the digital conversion, Billingsand 
&gt; the rest of Montana's major communities currently receiving PBS on 
&gt; cable will be served by an over-the-air signal beginning in 2003.

Just 125 miles to your east, there was the case of Columbia, 
Missouri, where there was effectively no over-the-air PBS service 
until earlier this year. PBS affiliate KMOS-TV/6 claimed coverage of 
Columbia. However, there was a little problem: interference in the 
city itself from KCOU/88.1 that made KMOS unwatchable. Even though 
KMOS came first, it was operated until about 1978 as a low-power 
repeater of CBS affiliate KRCG-TV/13 in Jefferson City. I was once 
told by a longtime broadcast engineer that this was intended to keep 
a third commercial VHF out of the Columbia market. It succeeded in a 
way: Columbia didn't get an ABC affiliate until KCBJ-TV/17 came on in 
1971. KRCG eventually wanted to increase power but had to dispose of 
KMOS first and thus donated it to Central Missouri State University. 
KMOS could rarely be seen outside Pettis County up until that time.

CMSU put KMOS on a relatively short stick north of Sedalia, bought a 
used transmitter from an Indianapolis TV station, and fired up the 
thing at full power for a station on channel 6 in 1980. But in the 
meantime, KCOU had come on the air in 1972 or 1973 (I forget which) - 
and effectively &quot;got there first&quot; as far as coverage of Columbia was 
concerned.

So, for those people who think that technical matters don't 
matter...well, they do, dang it, and this case proves it. KCOU's 88.1 
frequency is immediately next to channel 6 in the ol' electromagnetic 
spectrum. It effectively blocked KMOS for a radius of 10 miles or so, 
depending upon propagation conditions. No use complaining...KCOU was 
there first and KMOS hadn't exercised its full coverage rights soon 
enough.

Columbia's cable company couldn't even get a clear signal off the 
air. Twelve years later, it finally solved that problem by yanking 
KCPT from its Kansas City cable relay and substituing KMOS.

Spurred by the mandate to convert to DTV, KMOS built a new, much 
taller tower east of Sedalia, near Syracuse, and it went into 
operation a couple of months ago. I haven't heard how well it's doing 
in Columbia, but between that and a recent technical tweak at KCOU, 
PBS finally should be receivable over the air in a city once promoted 
by its chamber of commerce as &quot;College Town U.S.A.&quot;

Before 1980...no PBS at all, anywhere nearby. I remember when 
Columbia got cable service in 1977. I was a journalism and political 
science student at the University of Missouri. The profs were so 
excited that they *finally* could see &quot;Washington Week in Review&quot; 
every week!

   A blow for live TV: Colin Quinn's sketch comedy show bombed Monday
   night, losing an astounding 63 percent of its hefty celebrity &quot;Fear
   Factor&quot; lead-in.

   It looks to be the worst retention in at least four years for an NBC
   debut.

   Either America hates live prime-time sketch comedy, which seems
   unlikely given NBC's previous successes with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;
   special broadcasts, or it really dislikes &quot;SNL&quot; alum Quinn. It wasn't
   like loads of viewers watched the first part of the half-hour program
   and then tuned out; they watched &quot;Fear Factor&quot; -- the final half-hour
   of the celeb version nabbed nearly 20 million viewers -- and bailed
   before Quinn's debut.

   As of late yesterday, however, NBC had not yet canceled &quot;The Colin
   Quinn Show.&quot; Nope, NBC has given this program a solid three-episode
   commitment and, by jingo, it's going to live up to it.

Somebody was monitoring the situation in Topeka, obviously.  That 
market was issued just two VHFs, 11 and 13.  WIBW is at 13.  And then 
they sold their old tower to Washburn U. in, like, 1967, and 11 
became an ETV station, effectively shutting out the NBC and ABC 
affiliates.

Of course, cable ultimately equalized everything.

&gt;Just 125 miles to your east, there was the case of Columbia,
&gt;Missouri, where there was effectively no over-the-air PBS service
&gt;until earlier this year. PBS affiliate KMOS-TV/6 claimed coverage of

This pisses me off because I thought the show was quite funny. I am 
not a big fan of Colin Quinn but I thought I would check it out, I 
think a lot of people aren't fans of his, but just didnt want to 
check it out.

Look, the ratings arent terrible considering that NBC did practically 
no advertising, he is an SNL alumni, this is the first thing he has 
done since SNL (he left there in like 2000 didnt he) And SNL to begin 
with only gets about 8 or 9 million viewers a week, did they expect 
20 million to show up for a guy that wasnt that big on SNL which gets 
less than half of 20 million viewers?

NOW with Bill Moyers
Friday, March 15, 2002 at 9pm ET on PBS (check local listings)

This week on NOW...

Israeli tanks move into West Bank cities in the deadliest  fighting in
decades...Is the Middle East spinning out of control?  James Bennet,
the New York Times Bureau Chief in Jerusalem, provides a firsthand
account.  He says, &quot;A lot of people on both sides here believe now that
one or the other of these governments has to fall before there will be
a real truce, possibly both of them.&quot;

Then Israeli novelist  David Grossman joins Bill Moyers in conversation
about his latest novel and  life and language in the midst of chaos. 
He says of the violence that has become a daily companion in the life
of Israelis and Palestinians, &quot;You suspect everyone that you do not
know.  You do not go to most places now.  You calculate every step. 
All life changed for us there.  It's really to live in horror.&quot; 

In Brazil, a husband and wife team of biologists is battling to protect
the vast coral reefs that help sustain the world's food supply.   These
fragile reefs are under assault from a surprising source: tourists and
fishermen, and they're beginning to disappear.  NOW investigates in an
excerpt from &quot;Earth on Edge.&quot;

The war in Afghanistan is fought with bombs and bullets on the ground. 
Here at home the war against terrorism has no frontline and it's hard
to know just who the enemy is.  Consider the story of Anser Mehmood. 
On September 11, Anser was scheduled to make a delivery to the heart of
Washington, DC.  The delivery was cancelled, but that did little to
dispel the suspicion of the FBI. This NOW report explores the

&gt; Look, the ratings arent terrible considering that NBC did 
practically

ME: Jay has mentioned Letterman a number of times on his show.

And really, this &quot;jealousy&quot; talk is tabloid stuff with no basis in
reality.  Leno does just fine in the money department and, whenever
his next contract negotiation rolls around, he'll do even better.

&quot;Bill Reed, general manager of the public television station serving 
Kansas City.... said that 99.9 percent of TV households receive 
public television over the air. The 70 percent figure he 
called &quot;completely wrong.&quot; &quot;

bzzzzzt! With all due respect, Bill Reed is apparently smoking some 
of the same stuff other Network-affilate broadcasters do. They are 
under the delusion that they are broadcasting an adequate signal to 
the area that they claim to serve. 

Case in point: About a year and a half ago, a Portland PBS station 
was asking viewers to contact Directv and Dish Network and persude 
then to add their channel to the local offerings. I contacted the 
station manager via email and told him that as a broadcaster, he 
should be broadcasting a quality signal to the area that he claims to 
serve, not forcing their viewers into a pay service. He countered 
with a statment that signal interference (&quot;bouncing off of the Puget 
Sound&quot;) sadly made their coverage map look like swiss cheese. There 
was no consistent signal even within neighbors on the same street. I 
mailed back that by definition, those viewers would be out of their 
coverage area, and should rely on the national PBS signal available 
on satellite because that is what it was there for. Additionally, the 
Portland PBS station should not be rewarded for failing at it's job-- 
providing a FREE OTA signal to the coverage area that it claims to 
serve! I have no doubt that the Portland station is still lying to 
it's underwriters/ townspeople by showing them a inaccurate coverage 
map.

Bill Reed may THINK that PBS-- and the big four networks-- broadcast 
to 99.9% of the population, but the Earth's terrain and signal 
interference drops that number substantially. Just go ask San 
Francisco viewers that 'lost' their NBC Jan 1, 2002..... Or 
Stuebenville, OH residents without a full set of networks.... or 
those poor saps that live in very mountainous West Virginia.... and 
so on... 

The neilsen media DMA maps are not representative of actual broadcast 
signals.... only maybe if the earth was FLAT!

As if *they* don't have any bubble-headed bleached blondes who come on at 5
and tell you about the plane crash with a wink in their eye.  But I guess if
they're Republican and never did a Steven Bochco series, they're OK.

I'm not saying they'd be anxious.  Obviously they're not looking for
anyone else since they can keep Leno for a relatively cheap price.
What I'm suggesting is that CBS latenight is Letterman.  NBC latenight
is a forty year old franchise built up over the years by a number of
different personalities.  The Tonight Show has done well with other
hosts and I doubt NBC would view Leno as irreplaceable.

My goodness, there were more damn commercials and promos in the
Rosie/gay/adoption show than the NBC Olympics.  Really.  If I had
stayed awake I probably would have done a time study and reported on
it.  It was atrocious.

Anyone else notice this?

ME: No one on television is irreplaceable...or, at least, no less
replaceable than Mr. Carson was.

A &quot;franchise&quot; in television has very little staying power with the
wrong personnel...or even when a competing &quot;franchise&quot; suddenly looks
more appealing to viewers.  Once upon a time, the CBS Evening News was
regarded as an institution with a bulletproof heritage.  So was The
Today Show on NBC.  So was Nightline.  I doubt there's a person at NBC
who thinks The Tonight Show wouldn't crash and burn with the wrong guy
behind the desk...or even if the right person was on another channel
opposite.

Jay Leno is one of the highest paid performers in all of television.
I don't think what he gets is a &quot;relatively cheap price,&quot; except
relative to Letterman and a few others, all of whom went through
bidding wars, threats to leave, etc.  And you're right: He didn't
establish NBC latenight the way Dave built the time period for CBS.

But I think he's doing just fine in the money department and can hold
the network over a barrel any time he chooses to.  From what I can
gather, NBC is very much afraid of losing the guy, if only because
they think they've found someone who can keep an important franchise
afloat for another couple of decades.  Given the ratings track record
of the last seven years, that's not a naive assumption.

I'm sure this was in the works long before Eisner and Koppel had that little chat.

 It will be interesting to see how it compares to Frontline's porn doc which you can still watch online

<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/porn/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/porn/</a>

 It does seem like it will be Disney clean as opposed to what was on Frontline.


Subject  NIGHTLINE: Dirty Business 

TONIGHT'S SUBJECT: It's a multi-billion dollar industry, the only business
that is really making money on the internet, it helped fuel the VCR
revolution, and it's making big money for companies that you might not
expect. I'm talking, of course, about pornography.

----

When Ted travels, or even when he walks down the street, people always
come up and say &quot;hi,&quot; ask for an autograph or just say nice things about
Nightline. I have never seen anyone be anything but polite. Ted recently
went out to Las Vegas for an event, and the same thing happened to him as
he left the airport. But the driver who picked him up said something to
the effect of &quot;boy, you should have seen what happened when Ron Jeremy
came through the airport. It took him two hours to get out, everyone
wanted his autograph, to have their picture taken with him, just to say
hi.&quot;

Ron Jeremy, for those of you who don't know, or maybe don't want to admit
to knowing, is probably the most famous porn star in the U.S. And that got
us thinking about just how big an industry porn has become. As internet
businesses fail by the score, porn really is about the only business that
is making money on the net, and making it in the hundreds of millions of
dollars. A lot of people think that the VCR revolution was driven in no
small part by pornography. People could now watch it in their homes, and
not have to dare the sleazy movie theater in Times Square. In fact, those
theaters, which in many ways served as a rite of passage for many young
men, have really disappeared. So have most of the sleazy stores.

No, porn is now a business being run by business men. The phone companies?
They make money off of phone sex lines. The credit card companies? You
bet, how is this stuff being paid for? And companies that you might not
expect own cable or satellite companies that have explicit channels on
them. Go into just about any hotel room, and the in-house television
system will offer up adult movies, with the reminder that the titles will
not appear on your bill prominently displayed. One hotel chain that chose
not to offer adult movies estimates that they have lost millions of
dollars.

And clearly this is all happening because as porn becomes available in
ways that people can view it in the privacy of their own homes, there is
clearly a huge demand. And this has legal consequences as well. The legal
standard for obscenity is &quot;community standards.&quot; But if that community is
on the net, or on satellite tv, or cable, then the idea of &quot;community
standards&quot; almost becomes meaningless.

So tonight we're going to look at the business tonight, and for those of
you wondering, you're not going to see any dirty pictures on Nightline. I
don't know if that will be a disappointment or a relief to all of you, but
there is enough of it out there without us showing it to you. And if the
marketing experts are right, many of you, or people you know, are watching
already anyway.

&gt;
&gt;  Induction Ceremony And Concert Highlights
&gt;  Special VH1 &quot;Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Week,&quot; March 15-22,
&gt;  including the premiere of &quot;Rock The Hall: Inside the Rock and Roll Hall of
&gt;  Fame&quot; Friday, March 15 at 10pm
&gt;
&gt;
Santa Monica, CA, March 15, 2002 - From Memphis soul to '60s pop to New
York's new wavers and punkers, a diverse roster of the greatest names in
music history will be honored for all time when the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame presents its Seventeenth Annual Induction ceremony, airing exclusively
on VH1.  &quot;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 17th Annual Induction Ceremonies&quot;
celebrates the all-star evening featuring these latest inductees on
Wednesday, March 20 at 9:00 p.m. (ET/PT), on VH1.

&gt;  Held in New York City on March 18, this year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
&gt;  Induction Ceremony honors all-around soul legend Isaac Hayes, singing
&gt;  great Brenda Lee, popular Florida rockers Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,
&gt;  '60s singer-hitmaker Gene Pitney, and New York City's own punk pioneers
&gt;  The Ramones and new-wave art rockers Talking Heads.  In addition, the Rock
&gt;  and Roll Hall of Fame will recognize &quot;Non Performer&quot; honoree Jim Stewart,
&gt;  founder of early R&amp;B/soul label Stax Records, and &quot;Side-men&quot; inductee Chet
&gt;  Atkins, one of the most successful and influential guitarists in the
&gt;  history of pop music.
&gt;
&gt;  Presenters at this year's ceremony are respected artists whose music has
&gt;  been influenced by the Inductees.  The line-up for this year's presenters
&gt;  reflects the diversity and creativity of the inductees (presenters are
&gt;  bulleted followed by a dash with inductees):
&gt;
&gt;  *	Singer/songwriter Jewel - Brenda Lee
&gt;  *	Grammy winner Alicia Keys - Isaac Hayes
&gt;  *	Marty Stewart and Brian Setzer - Chet Atkins
&gt;  *	Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder - The Ramones

&gt;
&gt;  In addition, Green Day will perform songs by The Ramones, and the ceremony
&gt;  will be capped by an all star-jam.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  This is the sixth consecutive year that VH1 has aired the Rock and Roll
&gt;  Hall of Fame's Induction Ceremony and Concert, and the music network has
&gt;  an exclusive agreement with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation to
&gt;  broadcast the annual Induction Ceremony through 2003.  Last year's VH1
&gt;  telecast of the event was the most-watched Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
&gt;  Induction Ceremony ever.
&gt;
&gt;  &quot;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 17th Annual Induction Ceremonies&quot; highlights a

I don't think NBC is afraid of losing Jay, he is replacable, NBC 
knows that if they get rid of Jay they can have Conan or Stewart in 
there hosting in no time, they are both ratings gold and, contrary to 
the current Tonight Show host, they are funny.

There was a TON of commercials. I watched it though and found it to 
be pretty interesting, ABC kicked ass in the ratings last night with 
it too. We'll see if it helps Rosie's ratings.

&gt; ME: Jay has mentioned Letterman a number of times on his show

I can recall a couple of mentions myself(one when Dave was returning 
from the surgery)but whenever a guest mentions Letterman he's 
changing the subject at once.He's not comfortable mentioning 
Letterman,I think that's more than obvious.

&gt;  Leno does just fine in the money department and, whenever
&gt; his next contract negotiation rolls around, he'll do even better

On the one hand Jay should really consider becoming a Jesuit monk if 
he's not,at least,bothered by the Letterman story.On the other hand 
he would look ridiculous if he cried on the New York Post like a 
little jealous boy.He's a professional and he knows better so as to 
look his own bussiness no matter what other people are doing.
The only way to express his bitterness would be through his monologue 
with lots of irony on top and that's what he did. The gracious thing 
one would expect is NBC to rush and offer a raise. Maybe that's 
behind some peoples' minds rather than any animosities. Seems like a 
long-shot to me,though .

&gt;Letterman,I think that's more than obvious.

ME: What I get is that, until recently, he was uncomfortable with
letting guests take shots at Dave, or putting him in a situation where
he was expected to say something.  Lately, with Letterman taking the
occasional shot at Jay, I think Leno's more comfy about mentioning
him.

&gt;On the one hand Jay should really consider becoming a Jesuit monk if 
&gt;he's not,at least,bothered by the Letterman story.On the other hand 
&gt;he would look ridiculous if he cried on the New York Post like a

&gt;one would expect is NBC to rush and offer a raise. Maybe that's 
&gt;behind some peoples' minds rather than any animosities. Seems like a 
&gt;long-shot to me,though .

ME: I have to tell you that I've met Jay and been around him for
years, especially in the comedy club circuit, which is a notoriously
cut-throat environment.  I always found him to be very secure in what
he does and (usually) enormously sane about dealing with competition.

In a situation like this, with everyone talking about how much moola
Letterman is making, someone in Jay's position could take either of
two approaches.  He could say, &quot;How dare he get paid more than me?  I
demand a raise right this minute&quot; or he could say, &quot;Hey, I'm doing
fine and, in the long run, this will all work to my advantage.&quot;  It
would be a lot more fun for us spectators if he took the former but it
would be more typical of the guy if he took the latter.  I mean, he's
already making more money than he will ever be able to spend.  It's
not like getting a raise right this minute is going to have any real
effect on his life.

By the way: If anyone wants to discuss this matter, I'd suggest
checking out Brian Lowry's article in The Los Angeles Times...

...and this recent piece by Eric Boehlert in Salon.  This one comes
closest to the way I believe the entertainment industry perceives the
whole squabble...

SUNDAY ON 60 MINUTES:

JOHN NASH'S BEAUTIFUL MIND: Dr. John Nash, the mathematician on whose
remarkable life the best picture-nominated film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is
based,
speaks about that life for the first time and denies the allegations
that
have caused the film to be controversial.  Nash and his wife, Alicia,
both
speak out in this exclusive interview with Mike Wallace.

The allegations leveled at Nash, who suffered from schizophrenia, that
critics say were left out of the biographical film include
anti-Semitism,
homosexuality and being a bad father. Nash vigorously denies being
anti-Semitic, but acknowledges he may have said things while delusional
that
could be construed as anti-Semitic. &quot;I did have strange ideas during
certain
periods of time,&quot; he tells Wallace.  During that period he also heard
voices. &quot;It's really my subconscious talking, it was really that &quot;I
know
that now,&quot; says Nash. Was he homosexual? Alicia Nash says no. &quot;I've
known
him since I was 20 and that's just not true... I should know,&quot; she
says.
Nash denies it, too, but won't discuss it. &quot;I've learned that it's
better
that I don't talk about it,&quot; he tells Wallace.

POISONOUS STEW:  The government is still years away from constructing
secure
vessels and storage facilities for 90 million gallons of liquid nuclear
waste -- some of which is leaking - despite having already spent
billions on
the effort. Lesley Stahl investigates.
  
DAME JUDI: She's booked up though next year and has won five major
acting
awards in as many years, yet Dame Judi Dench fears each role could be
her
last.  The Academy-Award winning actress expresses these fears to Ed
Bradley
in this 60 MINUTES profile.  
  
Dench acknowledges that her fear of no future roles could be just the
fuel
that drives her great performances. &quot;Perhaps I need that kind of
terrible
fear to be pushed right to the edge in order to fall off. Who knows?&quot;
she
says.  

Dench won her Oscar as best supporting actress for her portrayal of
Queen
Elizabeth in &quot;Shakespeare in Love.&quot; She's also appeared in the hit
films,
&quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; and  &quot;Chocolat&quot; and stars in the current &quot;Iris,&quot; about a
writer's descent into Alzheimer's. But for Dench, the stage is where
her
talent really shows. &quot;I can make the audience believe that I am not...
like
I am as a real person... I can fool people,&quot; she tells Bradley, &quot;but on
film
- tricky.&quot;

THIS SUNDAY ON FACE THE NATION:  Chief Washington correspondent, Bob
Schieffer moderates...

This week Face the Nation will focus on the congressional agenda, and
judicial nominations.  This week the judicial nomination of Thomas
Pickering
was blocked by Democrats on the Judiciary committee in the Senate. 
Does
President Bush have the right to get his judges confirmed?  Is this a
sign
of upcoming confrontation in the Senate.  We'll talk with Senator Tom
Daschle, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, and on the other
side,
we'll talk with Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on
the
Judiciary Committee.  Gloria Borger will be here too.  


HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED FOR SUNDAY MORNING: Charles Osgood anchors
from
New York.

We'll start our broadcast with the debate on the right to die...Here's
Correspondent, John Blackstone with a preview of his story...&quot;In Oregon
people who are gravely ill have a unique and controversial right. 
Patients
diagnosed with less than six months to live can ask their doctors to
write a
prescription for drugs that will kill them.  Physician assisted suicide
has
been legal in Oregon for four years.  But Attorney General Ashcroft is
now
threatening to punish doctors in Oregon who help their patients die. A
court
hearing this Friday (3/22) could determine whether Oregon's &quot;Death with
Dignity Act&quot; will survive.  In our report for Sunday Morning we meet
patients who fear an important option may be taken from them and others
who
insist that no matter what, everyday is worth living. I hope you have
the
opportunity to tune us in. John Blackstone.&quot;

Here are some other highlights from this Sunday's broadcast...

As quoted from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Electoral observers
condemned the
voting process in Zimbabwe's presidential elections as neither free nor
fair, as the first results from the weekend's disorganized contest gave
President Robert Mugabe a 55%-45% lead over rival Morgan Tsvangiral...&quot;
Correspondent Mark Phillips will file a reporter's notebook on this
continuing story.  

Our resident critic, John Leonard, reviews the films SHOWTIME, starring
Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro, and HARRISON'S FLOWERS, staring Andie
MacDowell. Then, Correspondent, Rita Braver takes a look back at the
uniforms, sashes and the thousands of girl scout cookies that make up
the
tradition of the girl scouts, as they prepare to celebrate their 90th
Anniversary.

In a turn to sports, Bill Geist reports on Bobby Knight, the
controversial
Indiana coach who is trying to revive Texas Tech.  And to get the
spirit
going on St. Patrick's day we'll start you off with some wonderful
Irish
music to bring home the feeling.  Anchor Charles Osgood profiles, Liam
Clancy, one of Ireland's most prolific musicians on this very green
day.

A HERO IN OUR MIDST


There is a hero that attends my Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va. His name is Randy Smith. Let me tell you about him.


On March 11, Randy Smith, who is president of WSET, our ABC affiliate, chose to preempt an episode of the drama �Once and Again,� after learning that it would contain a passionate and provocative kiss between two teenage girls and examine a burgeoning relationship between a female high school student and her male drama teacher.


Amazingly, he was the only manager in the nation to pull the plug on the broadcast.


Predictably, an immediate outcry went out from homosexual-rights organizations. The Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation accused WSET of rejecting the episode �apparently because of a storyline involving gay and lesbian themes.�


But Randy Smith said nothing could be further from the truth.


�If we made these decisions based solely on homosexual content, we�d have major holes in our schedule,� he said. �There were a lot of factors that came into play � the number-one thing being the issue of minors being involved in a homosexual situation, and also the issue of the female student and her male teacher.�


It�s not like Smith banned every homosexual-themed broadcast from his station. In fact, this marked the first time WSET had refused to air an ABC show because of content. The station aired the high-profile coming out episode of �Ellen,� and airs other ABC series featuring prominent homosexual characters, including �Spin City� and �NYPD Blue.�


But GLAAD officials were unwilling to accept Mr. Smith�s decision to preempt the broadcast. Interestingly, GLAAD was even critical of ABC�s decision to attach a broadcast warning to parents, which read: �Due to Adult Subject Matter, Parental Discretion Is Advised.�


�There is nothing in this episode that could be construed as sexually explicit or inappropriate for family audiences,� GLAAD protested. �If this episode had featured Jessie sharing a first kiss with a boy, no parental advisory would have been posted. This inappropriate double standard inaccurately suggests that gay and lesbian content is by definition �adult subject matter�.�


Critics of Randy Smith�s decision have charged that it was a decision motivated by �hate� � a familiar theme of homosexual-rights leaders who habitually attempt to stigmatize their adversaries. But Randy said those who make this shallow charge are the actual �hate mongers� because they maintain an insensitivity toward people who hold sincere concerns about consequential moral issues. Indeed, anyone willing to inspect the reasoning behind Mr. Smith�s decision can see that he made it after much deliberation and out of concern for his community, not from a perspective of animosity toward homosexuals.


I think you can see now why I believe Randy Smith is a hero. He was willing to take a stand and to stand alone. The tragedy is that every other ABC TV station chief in our nation apparently believes that it is appropriate for network shows to explore relations between adults and teens and homosexuality among youths.


ABC�s �Once and Again� will no doubt continue to examine the teen characters� blossoming relationships. I am encouraging people to stay abreast of the show�s development of these sexual themes and to courteously let the network and their local ABC affiliates know that they object to this type of content. (GLAAD is encouraging their supporters to contact ABC to thank the network for the broadcast, so it is important that we counter their efforts.) Communications to ABC may be sent through the following venues:

&gt; Somebody was monitoring the situation in Topeka, obviously.  That 
&gt; market was issued just two VHFs, 11 and 13.  WIBW is at 13.  And then 
&gt; they sold their old tower to Washburn U. in, like, 1967, and 11 
&gt; became an ETV station, effectively shutting out the NBC and ABC 
&gt; affiliates.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, cable ultimately equalized everything.

Not just that, but it didn't really work for very long. KTSB/27 was on by 1969, if I recall correctly. And Kansas City stations were hauled in on cable.

I'm afraid that's the best I can do on that one right now: I couldn't quickly find info about KTSB and the earlier Star TV Magazine I have is from 1974.

What always bugged me about the Columbia situation was how long it lasted (1961-1980) *and* how long the aftereffects kept over-the-air PBS out of the largest city in the market (1980-2002).

Columbia's other dubious distinction is having the last major-network affiliate to go full-color: KOMU/8 in 1973. I worked there a mere four years later and the b/w equipment was there, with one b/w VTR still in daily use and the b/w telecine still in use for supers with luminance key over the &quot;slide-show&quot; ads on the color telecine. (Actually looked fairly mid-market, believe it or not.) The color cameras were bought used from KMOX-TV in St. Louis and seemed to enhance every facial blemish a person ever had.

: Los Angeles Times: As Letterman Trails Leno, Will More Promos Help?
X-URL: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la%2D000018879mar15">http://www.latimes.com/templates/misc/printstory.jsp?slug=la%2D000018879mar15</a>



               As Letterman Trails Leno, Will More Promos Help?

   By BRIAN LOWRY
   TIMES STAFF WRITER
   March 15 2002

   David Letterman's new contract with CBS requires the network to throw
   extra promotional weight behind his late-night program, bowing to
   Letterman's hope that will help narrow the gap between his show and
   ratings leader &quot;The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.&quot;
   Yet after a tumultuous 10 days in which Letterman's possible defection
   to ABC commanded national headlines, late-night ratings this week have
   been virtually unchanged, with Leno beating &quot;Late Show With David
   Letterman&quot; all three nights for which ratings are available--including
   Monday, when Letterman returned from a weeklong vacation and announced
   on the air his intent to stay at CBS.

   Analyzing data from 50 major cities monitored by ratings service
   Nielsen Media Research that account for well over half of U.S.
   households (national estimates for late night won't be available until
   next week), Leno has averaged a 4.6 rating and 12 share this week,
   meaning 4.6% of all homes and 12% of TV sets in use during that hour
   were tuned to &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; Letterman enjoyed a minor spike
   Monday, with a 3.9 rating and 10 share, but dropped the next two
   nights and averaged a 3.6 rating Monday through Wednesday, mirroring
   his average this season.

   Meanwhile, &quot;Nightline&quot; averaged a 4 rating in its half-hour and
   &quot;Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher&quot; averaged a 2.7 rating, both
   deviating only slightly from their season-long averages.
   Those results reinforce the sense that shifts in late-night viewing
   habits tend to be glacial, raising questions about how much impact
   additional promotion is likely to have--especially as long as NBC
   continues to beat CBS from 10:30 to 11 p.m., leading into late local
   newscasts. On Wednesday, for example, a rerun of NBC's &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;
   more than doubled viewing of &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; in that half-hour.
   The value of promotion may also be mitigated by how long the
   late-night players have been in place, with many people having made
   their viewing choices.

   For the season, Leno is averaging 6 million viewers per night
   nationally, compared with 4.3 million watching Letterman.
   Tune-in for both shows drops after midnight, and each leads ABC's
   combination of &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;Politically Incorrect With Bill
   Maher,&quot; which would have been displaced had ABC landed Letterman.
   Those shows average 4.6 million and 2.6 million viewers, respectively.
   Letterman's contract calls for CBS to leverage assets from parent
   company Viacom to promote the show, including MTV, VH1 and more than
   180 radio stations across the United States. Viewers can also expect
   to see extensive &quot;Late Show&quot; promotion during CBS' coverage of the
   NCAA basketball tournament.

&gt; Hmmmm. The Pointer Sisters &quot;New Attitude,&quot; the unofficial 
&gt; theme of the Dr. 
&gt; Laura radio show, is now being used in commercials where 
&gt; Patti LaBelle talks 
&gt; about menopause. Gee thanks... that's much better.

&quot;New Attitude&quot; was Patti LaBelle's hit, not the Pointer Sisters.  They
could've used &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; or &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot; instead
in the commercial... :)

&quot;The Group&quot;'s on NBC stations in Washington and New York, at least.  It's
not on WMAQ in Chicago because PBS station WTTW's the &quot;presenting&quot; station
to American Public Television, the secondary programming source to public TV
that actually distributes the show (among APG's other offerings:  &quot;The
Nightly Business Report,&quot; the Lawrence Welk reruns and most likely the
tackier pledge drive programming).

	I think I read something about this in the LA Times a few weeks
ago.  The McLaughlin Group moved from KNBC to KCET.  As other people have
pointed out, it runs on PBS affiliates in other parts of the country.  (It
think that's the case in Philly.)

	So, did anyone see former late night unfunny guy Chris Wylde on

I once spoke with somebody who was a substitute anchor at WIBW in the 
late 1980s.  He got something like a 50 share the nights he was on. 
So I think it worked a lot longer than you give credit for.

Let me clarify what I was saying -- cable and UHF were options for 
television stations long, long ago.  But IT WAS NOT AN EQUALIZING 
FACTOR, i.e., did not even pretend to be competitive with WIBW's VHS 
broadcast signal, until cable became ubiquitous a scant few years ago.


&gt;Not just that, but it didn't really work for very long. KTSB/27 was 
&gt;on by 1969, if I recall correctly. And Kansas City stations were 
&gt;hauled in on cable.

I don't know if HBO has a first-showing deal with Warner Brothers 
however, I would be very  surprise if they took the movie. It is not 
a big blockbuster and why give your competition free publicity even 
if its indirect.

I'd assume simply because both are owned by AOL-Time Warner, and I'd 
doubt that the name of the movie will really cause that many headaches.
