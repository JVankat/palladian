<div class="article_body">Defaults at Catalan financial banks fell last year despite the notable rise in interest rates, that in some cases have increased the monthly payments by 200 euros.<br />
<br />
The paradigm is La Caixa for its weight. From 2005 to 2006, defaults passed from 0.39% to 0.33%.<br />
<br />
Banc Sabadell reduced it from 0.49% to 0.39%, Caixa Terrassa from 0.51% to 0.31%, and Caixa Manresa from 0.67% to 0.64% according to the data made available to ’20 Minutos’ by the banks.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the figures at Caixa Catalunya worsened: from 0.6% to 0.72%. Defaults are considered worrying after 0.7%.<br />
<br />
“Despite everything, they attended to their bills religiously. Although they didn’t eat out,” explained the director of Commercial Planning of Caixa Terrassa, Pere Catalán. Actually, the Catalans cut leisure costs to be able to face their mortgages.<br />
<br />
“If unemployment doesn’t increase, we think that the rates of default will hold steady. Moreover, we predict that the rates will not rise much more than 0.25%,” he analyzed.<br />
<br />
Less optimistic is the professor of Economic Theory of the University of Barcelona, Gonzalo Bernardos. “The figures of default are disguised. They fall on a percent basis because the loans granted have risen, but you would have to ask the banks for the absolute numbers. And even more interesting is to know how many of those than signed mortgages at 2% have problems now,” commented Bernardos.<br />
<br />
Moreover, there are more clients postponing payments. “In reality there is fear. You don’t have to do more than see that the mortgages to individuals are given with many more conditions, the increase of the renegotiation of loans,” he assures.<br />
<br />
The granting of fixed rate mortgages hardly occurred in Catalonia. In 2006, Caixa Catalunya granted 2.58% of their loans with a fixed rate.<br />
<br />
Banc Sabadell, 1.5%. And Caixa Terrassa, 3.5%.<br />
