          Cheekville (later called Shirleyton) in Marion County, TN and
          operated a trading post.  An Indian bought a hunting knife, but
          he became disgruntled and returned. He attacked and killed William
          Shirley, a son of Thomas Sr.  Thomas Shirley Jr. was armed with
          a huge poker and was able to fend off the attacker. (this tale
          may not be true)</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thomas Shirley Jr. was witnessing
          land deeds in Hamilton County as early as 1828.  In 1836, he
          sold Moses Payne five slaves for $3,100.  An election was held
          &quot;at the house of Thomas Shirley&quot; in February of 1836.
           He acquired 434 acres, including Williams Island and land on
          the side of Walden's Ridge.  At his property near Ooltewah, he
          had a ferry landing and half interest in the Shropshire mill.
           John Jackson Shropshire had married Mary Shirley at Whitwell
          in 1821.  Thomas Shirley Jr. was active in trying to establish
          the town of Vannville (Harrison) and was its first postmaster
          in 1839.  He was an admirer of the Cherokee Chief James Brown,
          and he named one son for Brown.</FONT></P>
          <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thomas Shirley Jr. on Nov. 25,
          1863, fled his home &quot;under advice from neighbors from threats
          that had been made that would cost him his life.&quot;  Julia
          Ann and the daughter, Adaline, stayed at the house, though they
          spent most nights with Henry and Louisa Penick. Shirley made
          his way to the home of Robert and Eliza Williamson near Tunnell
          Hill , Ga. , refugeeing there several weeks.  He became deathly
          ill, but finally recovered.  His wife and daughter arrived with
          two horses, a wagon and some bedding, and they went on to join
          James B. Shirley at Thomaston.  Meanwhile, a Union man, Peter
          Monger, took over the Shirley place.  He allowed a cohort, Joseph
          G. Ritchie, to live there.  Other members of Ritchie's family
          had been killed by Confederate sympathizers, and he had vowed
          revenge.  While Ritchie was at the Shirley home, it was burned
          down in the winter of 1864-65 by the Confederate William Snow
          &quot;and his bandits.&quot; </FONT></P>
