National homelessness statistics indicate that for those cases assessed as unintentionally homeless and in priority need, the median case duration, from application to duty discharge, has increased from just under 6 weeks in 2002/3 to nearly 18 weeks in 2006/7.</p><p>155. Through the local outcome agreements and progress reports, a number of reasons were given for an increase in the time taken to close cases. In the main these related to the limited supply in the area of affordable social housing and the need to rehouse others in waiting need as well as homeless households. One authority mentioned particular difficulties following stock transfer given that arrangements with local <acronym title="Registered Social Landlord">RSL</acronym>s were not fully in place.</p><p>156. It was also noted that it sometimes took time to properly attend to support needs before a sustainable tenancy could be offered and that in some cases the longer wait for a case to be resolved was offset by the fact that this led to a more positive outcome for the household than could have been offered immediately. Some authorities noted that this choice was explicitly made by the applicant household themselves, particularly where they were entitled to more than one offer of accommodation and were relatively happy to remain in good temporary accommodation in the meantime. However it was also mentioned that in some cases, these expectations of a better offer were unrealistic and therefore caused delay with no prospect of a more positive outcome.</p><p>157. Local authorities are taking forward a wide range of actions to attempt to reduce the duration of homelessness. A number of authorities are focussing on steps they can take to reduce the time taken to make assessments and reach decisions. These include integrating assessment processes; recruiting additional staff; appointing a homelessness services co-ordinator to ensure consistent quality across the area; streamlining the appeals process; and introducing monthly performance monitoring against agreed targets.</p><p>158. Most local authorities are working towards reducing time spent in temporary accommodation with some adopting the approach of employing staff dedicated to shortening the journey time through the system for particular groups of clients (families with children for example) or focussing on particular types of temporary accommodation (e.g. B&amp;B). Where young people are involved, one local authority highlighted that the duration of homelessness can be reduced where the youth mediation officer is able to intervene to facilitate an appropriate return to the family home.</p><p>159. Move on services have also been developed linked to hostels and other types of temporary accommodation where people tend to stay for longer periods and may require assistance to acquire independent living skills or to address entrenched behavioural issues. Local authorities are also developing furnished tenancies, furniture and starter packs and offering advice on finance and benefits entitlement in order to support households to move into sustainable permanent accommodation more quickly. One authority highlighted their practice of converting temporary accommodation to permanent where appropriate.</p><p>160. Half of authorities mentioned that they are running Private Sector Leasing Schemes or were in the process of exploring this option. Rent deposit/guarantee schemes and better information on the market were also mentioned as important mechanisms for increasing access to the private rented sector.</p><p>161. In terms of accessing permanent accommodation, a significant number of authorities are reviewing their allocations policies in order to set targets for percentages of lets going to homeless households. Significant numbers also mentioned establishing or reviewing arrangements to access <acronym title="Registered Social Landlord">RSL</acronym> properties under section 5 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001; this may help to address the current relatively low level of lets to homeless households by <acronym title="Registered Social Landlord">RSL</acronym>s.</p><p>162. A number of local authorities have also created, or are in the process of creating, a common housing register which is seen as a positive development for homeless households looking to access permanent social housing. One authority mentioned taking a more flexible approach to allocating properties to single people (i.e. giving single people equal access to 2 bed properties) and another highlighted a decision to offer all relets to homeless people in the first instance for a limited period of time. One authority noted that they were conducting a review of properties refused by homeless households to inform their allocations policy going forward.</p><p>163. A number of authorities take a housing options approach to enable homeless households to make an informed choice about their preferences for rehousing. This covers both priority need households in order that they can make realistic choices regarding their options and also non-priority households so that they are aware of the range of options open to them.</p><p>164. A number of authorities discussed the broader actions being taken to improve the supply of affordable housing in their area and one focused on a specific review system for tackling voids.</p><p>165. Reflecting local authorities' responses, Communities Scotland inspectors found that the periods of time spent by homeless people in temporary accommodation are often linked to the supply of permanent accommodation but that the priority given to homeless households in a number of councils' allocations system is also a factor, as are weaknesses in the management of applications.</p><table border="1" cellspacing="1"><tr><td><p>Conclusions</p><p>The duration of homelessness has increased. This is mainly linked to lack of availability of appropriate move-on settled accommodation. However there are also other avenues which local authorities are exploring to reduce waiting time in temporary accommodation while also ensuring an appropriate response is provided.</p><p>Landlords and advice services should develop housing options approaches. These should ensure that people in housing need are aware of their entitlements, local services and the range of accommodation options in order that they can make an informed choice about the most sustainable option for their circumstances.</p></td></tr></table><!-- DIXERIT_STOP --><p class="rAlign"><a href="/Publications/2008/03/27142559/8">&#171; Previous</a> | <a href="/Publications/2008/03/27142559" class="parent">Contents</a> | <a href="/Publications/2008/03/27142559/10">Next &#187;</a></p></div><div class="hidden"><a href="#onthispage">Back to contents</a></div></div>
