In more than two decades at the Statesman, Mike's been a copy editor, Sunday editor, Page 1 designer and, for the past 14 years, XL art director. But after more than 700 XL covers, nine XL Dining Guides, managing the hundreds of listings in our restaurant database and writing stories about doughnuts, Vietnam and the Incredible Hulk, he'll finally be able to put his nine years of fancy restaurant job experience (thank you, drive through) to good use. This means he can write about trailer tacos on South Lamar, $250 anniversary dinners at Hudson's, smoking a cigar with Michael Moriarty at Louie's 106, brewing his own Anderson's Coffee stout beer and freeloading at kids-eat-free nights all over town.">Forklore</a></li>

        	<p>The United States Honor Flag, which flew over Ground Zero after 9/11 and in Iraq during combat there, will accompany Wednesday&#8217;s funeral for Patrick Sirois, a Fort Hood police officer who was killed last week in Oklahoma while helping a stranded motorist.</p>

<p>Sirois, 50, was traveling to visit family for Thanksgiving last Tuesday when he stopped on the side of a highway near Eufala, Okla. to help a driver whose pickup had broken down. Another motorist struck the pickup, pinning Sirois, who was wearing a reflective traffic vest, against the guardrail, according to the Associated Press.</p>

<p>Sirois, who retired from the U.S. Army in 2002 after more than 20 years of service, was a civilian Fort Hood police officer and reserve officer for the Nolanville Police Department. Last year, he was named the Nolanville Officer of the Year.</p>

<p>A funeral service will be held Wednesday at noon at the Killeen Convention and Conference Center.</p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2010/11/05/one_dead_in_fm_969_vehicle_col_1.html">Man arrested in overnight fatal hit-and-run on FM 969</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>A man was killed early Friday in East Austin when he was struck by a pickup that fled the scene, possibly while the man was checking on damage to his car from a previous hit-and-run wreck, police said.</p>

<div style="float: right;"><a href="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/blotter/upload/2010/11/one_dead_in_fm_969_vehicle_col_1/David%20Andaverde%20MUG.jpg"><img src="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/blotter/upload/2010/11/one_dead_in_fm_969_vehicle_col_1/David%20Andaverde%20MUG-thumb.jpg" width="94" height="130" alt="David Andaverde MUG.jpg"/></a></div>

<p>Police have charged David Martinez Andaverde, 46, at right, with DWI in the case, and said more charges are pending.</p>

<p>The victim, a 47-year-old man whose name was not released pending notification of his family, was driving a 1998 Buick LeSabre east on FM 969 near Craigwood Drive when he was struck from behind by another vehicle about 2:25 a.m., police said. The driver of the second vehicle did not stop, while the Buick came to a rest in the road. </p>

<p>Witnesses said that after the driver of the Buick got out of the car, both he and his car were struck by an eastbound red Dodge pickup that also left the scene, according to police. </p>

<p>Investigators said the pickup lost its left front wheel in the collision, and that the truck then left gouge marks in the road as it continued east. Travis County sheriff&#8217;s deputies and witnesses followed the gouge marks and found the pickup in a driveway in the 9300 block of FM 969, where Andaverde was arrested, police said.</p>

<p>Anyone with information on the incident is asked to call vehicular homicide unit detectives at 974-8164.</p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2010/11/02/officials_name_truck_driver_wh.html">Officials name truck driver who died in fiery crash</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>The Travis County Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office has identified the truck driver who died in a fiery crash on U.S. 183 Saturday morning as 38-year-old Hector Garcia of Taylor.</p>

<p>Garcia died after the 18-wheeler he was driving flipped on an overpass at U.S. 183 and MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1). The truck was hauling gasoline and burst into flames.</p>

<p>The cause of death is pending, said Sarah Scott, chief administrative officer at the Travis County Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to wait on toxicology results, which take six to eight weeks,&#8221; Scott said.</p>

<p>Austin police spokesman Dennis Farris said Saturday that investigators think the driver may have been going too fast and that may have contributed to his inability to navigate the curve.</p>

<p>The Austin Fire Department responded to the fire on the ramp with about 20 trucks and 75 firefighters, department spokesman Randall Elmore said Saturday.</p>

<p>Firefighters used a 3,100-foot hose to cool the steel rebar reinforcing the road and keep the structure from collapsing under the heat, Elmore said.</p>

<p>CORRECTION: This blog has been fixed to show the correct age of Hector Garcia. </p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2010/07/16/no_charges_filed_in_fatal_golf.html">No charges filed in fatal golf cart accident</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>Even though an investigation showed alcohol use may have played a role, authorities have decided not to file charges in the May 1 death of a 17-year-old Hays High School student.</p>

<p>Alyssa Marie Bargsley of Kyle died after falling off a golf cart driven by another teenager in the Hill Country town of Kingsland.</p>

<p>At the time, officers said the driver was swerving back and forth, and Bargsley fell when the cart hit a bump in the road. She hit her head on pavement.</p>

<p>On Friday, TABC announced the findings of its investigation with the Llano County sheriff&#8217;s office and the Department of Public Safety. TABC said in a news release:</p>

<blockquote>The investigation &#8230; reveals that Bargsley and two other minors, a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old, had consumed alcoholic beverages at a residence in Kingsland, Texas, prior to the accident. However, statements collected in connection with the investigation indicate that the minors had obtained the alcoholic beverages from inside the house without the knowledge of any adults. </blockquote>

<blockquote>The case investigation was reviewed by Llano County Attorney Cheryll Mabray. Mabray agreed with the agency&#8217;s findings and elected not to pursue charges for furnishing alcoholic beverages to the minors, a charge that requires proof of criminal negligence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In keeping with agency policy, TABC agents did not charge any of the minors involved with the illegal possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages. TABC&#8217;s Carson Starkey Amnesty Policy enacted in 2009 says that TABC will not charge minors with the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages when someone has called 911 because of a medical emergency. TABC Administrator Alan Steen said, &#8220;It is our hope that publicizing this policy will encourage young people to call 911 if a friend is in danger from alcohol poisoning or any other medical emergency. We don&#8217;t want any life to be lost because someone is afraid of getting in trouble for underage drinking.&#8221;</blockquote>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2010/06/20/father_son_die_at_lake_georget.html">Father, son die in Lake Georgetown</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>A father and son died after their car drove off a boat ramp into Lake Georgetown at Cedar Breaks Park about 11 p.m. Saturday, said Assistant Chief Kevin Stofle with the Georgetown Police Department.</p>

<p>Scott Douglas Hughes, 31, and his 5-year-old son, Ethan Hughes, from Georgetown, were pronounced dead at the scene at 1:50 a.m. Sunday.</p>

<p>Four witnesses at the boat ramp who were waiting to exit the lake said they saw Hughes&#8217; black 2009 Chevrolet Impala drive off the ramp. The witnesses told police that Hughes&#8217; vehicle neither sped up nor slowed down when approaching the water where the posted speed limit is 10 mph, Stofle said.</p>

<p>The witnesses tried to rescue the father and son, as did as responders from Georgetown police, the Williamson County sheriff&#8217;s office, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from Lake Georgetown.</p>

<p>Stofle said at one point a dozen officers shed their gear and tried swimming down to the vehicle that sunk to a depth of 20 feet.</p>

<p>Investigators do not know why the father and son&#8217;s vehicle drove into the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too preliminary in the investigation to know that at this time,&#8221; Stofle said.</p>

<p>When a wrecker pulled the vehicle from the water, officers noticed that two of the vehicle&#8217;s windows were down, Stofle said. </p>

<p>Cedar Breaks Park, located on the south shore, is one of three parks in the area with a boat ramp. Lake Georgetown was busy this past weekend and is nearly full at about 792 feet, Stofle said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very popular spot, especially because it&#8217;s a holiday weekend with Father&#8217;s Day and the start of summer,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Round Rock Police Department officials have identified Shaylah Dame as the 12-year-old who was struck and killed about 6:50 p.m. Thursday in the 1800 block of Gattis School Road. </p>

<p>Dame was hit was near the <a href="http://www.roundrocktexas.gov/home/index.asp?page=210">Clay Madsen Recreation Center</a> in Round Rock. </p>

<p>A sixth grader at <a href="http://schools.roundrockisd.org/cdfulkes/">Fulkes Middle School</a>, Dame was walking home from a skate park where she had been with friends when the collision happened, said Joylynn Occhiuzzi, a spokeswoman for the Round Rock school district. </p>

<p>She was crossing the street alone when she was hit by the car, Occhiuzzi said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her friends described her as being cheerful, friendly, and she knew how to make people laugh,&#8221; Occhiuzzi said.</p>

<p>Shaylah was involved in the choir and also a member of a girl empowerment club, Occhiuzzi said. Students at the school were receiving counseling from crisis counselors today, she said. </p>

<p>Residents from the neighborhood will be holding a rally at 10 a.m. Saturday in front of the Clay Madsen Recreation Center, Occhiuzzi said. </p>

<p>Neighbors say they plan to ask for a crosswalk next to the recreation center.</p>

<p>Dame&#8217;s parents, whose names she declined to release, will not be attending the rally, Occhiuzzi said.</p>

<p>Witnesses told police the girl ran south, mid-block, in front of traffic, said police spokesman Eric Poteet. She was struck by a westbound Toyota sedan driven by a Hutto woman.</p>

<p>The car&#8217;s driver stopped immediately and tried to render aid, but the girl never regained consciousness. The girl was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead an hour later, he said. </p>

<p>Poteet said no charges are expected to be filed against the driver, whose name is being withheld pending completion of the investigation.</p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2009/11/12/help_with_hit_and_run_fatality.html">Officials looking for suspect in fatal hit-and-run</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>The Department of Public Safety is asking for the public&#8217;s help in finding the driver of a gravel truck that fled the scene of a collision that killed 5-year-old Lilly Bunker of Kyle on Oct. 26 in Caldwell County.</p>

<div style="float: right;"><a href="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/blotter/upload/2009/11/help_with_hit_and_run_fatality/P5210256.jpg"><img src="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/blotter/upload/2009/11/help_with_hit_and_run_fatality/P5210256-thumb.jpg" width="225" height="168" alt="P5210256.jpg"/></a></div>

<p>The sole description of the truck is a white or gray 19-wheel gravel truck with a bottom- or rear-dumping capacity, said Tela Mange, a DPS spokeswoman.</p>

<p>The truck left the scene of a collision 7:15 a.m. Oct. 26 on Texas 80 near FM 1977, Mange said. The northbound gravel truck was changing lanes in wet conditions when it collided with a 1982 Mercedes-Benz, which was forced into southbound traffic.</p>

<p>The Mercedes hit a 1995 black Chevrolet Camaro driven by Lilly Bunker&#8217;s mother. The Mercedes driver, Lilly&#8217;s mother and her 7-year-old brother survived, Mange said. Lilly Bunker was taken to Dell Children&#8217;s Medical Center in Austin, where she later died, said Tom Vinger, a DPS spokesman.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about the collision or about the driver who fled the scene is asked to call DPS at 512-398-4333.</p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2009/11/03/pedestrian_struck_killed_on_fm.html">Pedestrian struck, killed on FM 620</a></h3>
	

        	<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Travis County accident investigators this afternoon were still trying to piece together the events leading up to a collision with an 18-wheeler that killed a pedestrian this morning on FM 620 near Quinlan Park Road.</p>

<p>The identity of the victim, who appeared to be about 30 years old, has not released, Travis county Sheriff&#8217;s Capt. Art Cardenas said.</p>

<p>Witnesses told investigators they saw the man walking on the side of the roadway about 8 a.m., Cardenas said. The victim&#8217;s car was parked on the side of the road near the site of the collision, he said.</p>

<p>It appears the man at one point stepped into the roadway where he was struck at highway speed by a westbound 18-wheeler, Cardenas said. The driver of the semi stopped and notified authorities, he said.</p>

<p>No charges were filed in connection with the incident, Cardenas said.</p>

        	<p>The driver of an 18-wheeler carrying building supplies was killed this morning when his truck flipped over on the southbound frontage road of Interstate 35 at Westinghouse Road, Round Rock police spokesman Eric Poteet said.</p>

<p>The driver was the only person in the truck when the wreck occurred about 8:15, and there were no other injuries, Poteet said.</p>

<p>The driver&#8217;s identity was not immediately available, Poteet said. </p>

<p>The truck had been lying on its side, and some lumber and debris was strewn across the southbound frontage road. The truck has been towed away, and the roadway is clear, officials said</p>

<p>The southbound frontage road at Westinghouse is open again, and traffic on I-35 is flowing in both directions, Poteet said.</p>

        	<p>Austin police have identified a 22-year-old bicyclist who was struck and killed Sunday morning on Texas 71 as Robert Mendez.</p>

<p>Mendez died about 4:30 a.m. after he was struck by a Nissan Pathfinder while riding in a highway exit lane near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, Cpl. Scott Perry said.</p>

<p>Poor lighting at the exit might have made it hard for the driver to see Mendez, who was dressed in a black jacket and black pants and was riding a black bicycle without lights, Perry said.</p>

<p>The driver stopped after the crash and cooperated with investigators, Perry said, and no charges are expected to be filed. The case, however, remains under investigation.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about Austin&#8217;s 55th fatality of the year is asked to call 974-4742. </p>

        	<p>Texas Department of Public Safety officials say two people died early this morning when the Chevy Tahoe they were riding in rolled over, went airborne and ejected them from the vehicle.</p>

<p>Their names and ages have not been released because troopers haven&#8217;t notified their family members, DPS trooper Darryl Tidwell said. </p>

<p>The one vehicle accident happened underneath the Colorado River Bridge off of Texas 71 at around 12:30 a.m. Tidwell said a 2001 Chevy Tahoe was traveling westbound on 71 and drifted into a ditch. Then, he said the car went airborne, rolled several times and struck several trees before it came to rest. </p>

<p>Two passengers were ejected and died, four were injured. Two of the passengers were sent to Smithville Regional Hospital and two others were taken to Brackenridge. He said teenagers were injured in the accident, but he could not give more information this morning, he said. </p>

        	<p>Austin police are investigating a fatal collision that occurred about 2:55 a.m. at the intersection of Springdale Road and 51st Street. </p>

<p>The motorcycle driver was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge, where he was later pronounced deceased, Hudson said. Police described him as a white male in his 60s. </p>

<p>It was still unclear if the motorcyclist was wearing a helmet, Hudson said, but he suffered massive head and leg injuries. His identity has not been released pending notification of relatives. </p>

<p>Hudson said the driver of the Mazda, 33-year-old Rudy Lucero, was also taken to Brackenridge with minor injuries. He has been arrested and charged with intoxication manslaughter. </p>

        	<p>An Austin man died Saturday afternoon when his Honda ran off the road in Llano County.</p>

<p>Kirk Elliot Holladay, 40, was heading east on RR 965 when his Honda ran off the roadway to the right as the road curved to the left, according to Department of Public Safety dispatcher Allen Muller. The vehicle hit a concrete culvert before rolling numerous times, he said.</p>

<p>Holladay was pronounced dead at the scene at 4:22 p.m.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Due to incorrect information given by the Texas Department of Public Safety, previous reports that Holladay was driving a motorcycle have been corrected. Holladay was driving a Honda hatchback, according to DPS.  </p>

        	<p>Austin police are investigating a fatal accident that killed a construction worker on southbound Interstate 35 about 1:30 this morning.</p>

<p>Police said a dark-colored sport-utility vehicle ran through a clearly marked construction zone and hit the worker in the 11400 block of I-35, near Onion Creek Parkway. The driver fled the scene, and nobody else was injured, police said.</p>

<p>The worker has been identified as Fontino Cortes-Cruz, 36, police said.</p>

<p>The SUV went south after the crash, and Austin police notified Hays County officials to be on the lookout for the vehicle, said Sgt. Richard Stresing with the Austin Police Department.</p>

<p>Hays County sheriff&#8217;s deputies found a burned dark-colored SUV outside of Kyle about 4 a.m., Stresing said.</p>

<p>Shortly after, police received a call from South Austin Hospital that a man with burns on his body had checked into the hospital, Stresing said.</p>

<p>Police are interviewing him as a person of interest in the crash, Stresing said.</p>

<p>Cortes-Cruz was part of a crew that was repaving the interstate, said Marcus Cooper, spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation. He had been laying reflective tabs on the highway when he was hit, Cooper said. </p>

        	<p>Gilberto Huerta, 23, of Conroe died early Sunday morning of injuries from a car accident that happened at about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. Police are looking for the driver of the other vehicle, a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado truck, who fled on foot after the accident, according to Austin police Sergeant Richard Stresing.</p>

<p>The driver of the Silverado was traveling the wrong way on the eastbound lanes of U.S. 290 in east Austin near Berkman Drive when it collided head-on with a 2004 Chevrolet Impala, Stresing said. </p>

<p>Huerta, who was driving the Impala, died later at University Medical Center-Brackenridge. Two passengers were also taken to the hospital, where Stresing said they are listed as stable with injuries that are not life-threatening.</p>

<p>Stresing said the driver of the Chevrolet, once found, will be charged at the least with failure to stop and render aid, a felony. </p>

        	<p>A Round Rock man was killed Sunday evening after he lost control of his car while driving north on Interstate 35 near FM 3406, police said today. </p>

<p>Gilberto Dejesus Cruz, 39, was driving a blue sedan at a high speed while swerving in and out of traffic, police said. </p>

<p>Police said Cruz lost control of the vehicle, and he was ejected from it as it rolled several times. He was the only person in the car, and no other people were injured. Cruz was not wearing his seatbelt, police reported. </p>

<p>The highway had to be closed for about two hours, said Round Rock police, because of excessive debris in the road. The highway was reopened about 10:20 p.m.</p>

<p>It is undetermined if drugs or alcohol impairment was a factor. It was Round Rock&#8217;s first fatality of 2009.</p>

        	<p>Texas State University-San Marcos police are investigating an accident that led to the death of a 39-year-old student Saturday morning.</p>

<p>University officials said the student, identified Saturday as Kevin Ray Cresap of San Marcos, drove his 2007 Hyundai off the road into Sink Creek on the Aquarena Center property on Texas State campus, Mark Hendricks, a spokesman for the university said. The incident happened around 3:21 a.m., Hendricks said. </p>

<p>A University police officer saw the car&#8217;s headlights beneath the water&#8217;s surface and called fire and rescue workers, and a wrecker to remove the overturned and submerged car from the creek. When the car was retrieved from the water, Cresap was found inside, Hendricks said. </p>

<p>He was pronounced dead at the scene by Hays County Justice of the Peace Margie Hernandez.</p>

<p>A preliminary investigation indicates that Cresap had turned onto Laurel Ridge from Aquarena Springs Drive when he lost control of his car and drove into the creek, Hendricks said. He said an autopsy has been scheduled. </p>

        	<p>A 10-year-old girl died this afternoon after she came into contact with electrical wiring outside her home in Cedar Park, officials said.</p>

<p>About 3:30 p.m., family members found Cecilia Isquierdo outside the home, in the 2100 block of East Riviera Drive,  after they realized she wasn&#8217;t in the house, police said. </p>

<p>Emergency officials were called, but Cecilia died before they arrived, police said.</p>

        	<p>Police have identified a motorcycle rider who was killed in a crash that involved six motorcycles, a Mercedes and a Chevrolet pickup at 1:47 early Sunday morning on East Martin Luther King Boulevard just west of Springdale Road.</p>

<p>Police say they have arrested the driver who, according to police, caused the accident in which Maurice Britt, of San Antonio, died and two others were taken to the hospital in critical condition. </p>

<p>Mario Hernandez-Rodriguez, 21, was arrested Sunday, and police say they will charge him with intoxication manslaughter and failure to stop and render aid. Hernandez-Rodriguez remains in the Travis County Jail.</p>

<p>Corporal Scott Perry of the Austin Police Department said the motorcycles and Mercedes were traveling east on MLK Boulevard when Hernandez-Rodriguez, headed westbound, veered into oncoming traffic and hit the Mercedes, then continued in the eastbound lanes and hit two of the motorcycles, Perry said. Hernandez-Rodriguez then fled on foot and was found by Austin police officers and an Austin Police K-9.</p>

<p>Britt, 36, was pronounced dead on the scene, Perry said. A 30-year-old female, who was a passenger on the motorcycle, and a 42-year-old male, the driver of a second motorcycle, were taken to University Medical Center-Brackenridge, Perry said, where their condition was listed as critical Sunday. The driver of the Mercedes was not transported to the hospital, Perry said. Police did not have an update on their conditions Monday.</p>

        	<p>Police are investigating a one-vehicle accident in Northwest Austin early Saturday that left one man dead.</p>

<p>Lt. Max Johnson, a spokesman for the Austin Police Department, said that a man was driving a 2002 GMC pickup truck westbound on Anderson Mill Road between U.S. 183 and RM 620 around 2 a.m. The driver hit the south curb line, then crossed both lanes of traffic and made contact with the north curb line before the truck left the roadway and struck a sound barrier retaining wall, police said. </p>

<p>The driver was taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge where he was pronounced dead shortly after the accident, Johnson said. The man&#8217;s name and age have not been released pending positive identification and notification of his relatives, according to police.</p>

<p>Johnson said investigators think alcohol might have been a factor in the accident. Anyone with more information about the incident is asked to call APD vehicular homicide detectives at 974-8543. Saturday&#8217;s accident is the 11th traffic fatality in Austin this year.</p>

        	<p>Police are looking for drivers who fled the scene of a fatal traffic accident in the 3100 block of Texas 71 near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport Friday night, an Austin police spokesman said Saturday. </p>

<p>Police spokesman Sgt. Richard Stresing said that a 55-year-old man was running across Texas 71 around 9 p.m. Friday. The man made it across three westbound lanes, but he was struck by a vehicle in the inside lane, then another in the center eastbound lane, Stresing said. Those two cars stopped, but the man was still in the road. Two other cars struck the man and left the scene, Stresing said. </p>

<p>The man, whose name has not been released, was pronounced dead at the scene. His death is Austin&#8217;s fourth traffic fatality this year. </p>

<p>Witnesses told police that the two cars that left the scene were a van and a white sports utility vehicle, but Stresing said detectives were looking for more detailed information. </p>

<p>&#8220;We would like to be in contact with the drivers, since they might not know what they ran over,&#8221; Stresing said. He said that detectives do not anticipate filing charges against the two drivers that stopped. </p>

<p>Police ask that anyone with more information about the accident call detectives at 974-8266.</p>

<p>Austin police spokesman Richard Stresing said the woman, who had been driving eastbound in the 1500 block of Ben White Boulevard near the Gold&#8217;s Gym, lost control of the vehicle and left the roadway and crashed on the eastbound service road around 1:15 a.m.</p>

<p>Stresing said the 2002 Chevy Trailblazer the woman was driving rolled over and no other vehicles were involved in the accident. </p>

<p>Paramedics took the woman to the University Medical Center at Brackenridge, where she was pronounced dead at 3:03 a.m., Stresing said. Vehicular homicide detectives are investigating the accident. </p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2008/11/21/police_still_investigating_bod.html">Police still investigating body in Lady Bird Lake</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>Austin police said today that they are investigating the death of a woman whose body was found in Lady Bird Lake last week as &#8220;equivocal,&#8221; meaning they are exploring all options in how she may have died. </p>

<p>However, homicide Sgt. Joe Chacon said today that authorities have no evidence that Jill Walker Robinson was a victim of foul play &#8212; she had no trauma to her body &#8212; and are investigating the possibility that she may have died accidentally or from suicide.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to indicate that she died at the hands of another,&#8221; said Chacon, who would not discuss evidence officials collected at the scene.</p>

<p>Robinsons&#8217; body was found a week ago today after a woman in a canoe saw what appeared to be a body face-down in the water and called police. The body was recovered that afternoon.</p>

<p>Chacon said detectives are awaiting their most crucial piece of evidence: results of a toxicology report, which would indicate whether Robinson had drugs or other substances in her system.  Test results from the Travis County Medical Examiner&#8217;s office could take several weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be a big issue in our final determination,&#8221; Chacon said.</p>

<p>He said detectives also are still talking to friends and family members about Robinson, including matters such as her emotional state in recent weeks.</p>

        	<p>The Hays County sheriff&#8217;s office is investigating the apparent drowning death of a Kyle man Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Authorities received a call of a possible drowning at Five Mile Dam located at 4444 S. Old Stagecoach Road just south of Kyle around 4 p.m. Sunday. Firefighters located a man in about 8 feet of water, Leroy Opiela, a sheriff&#8217;s office spokesman said.</p>

<p>The man was identified today as 27-year-old Juan Humberto Lopez Beltran. He was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>

<p>According to witnesses, Beltran had been canoeing and was in a large pool of water. He got out of the canoe to walk to shore when he apparently stepped off into deeper water, Opiela said. Although he began yelling for help, he went under before he could be found in the water, Opiela said. </p>

<p>His body has been taken to the Travis County medical examiner&#8217;s office. Opiela said that the incident is under investigation.</p>

        	<p>Austin police are investigating a fatal motorcycle accident that shut down parts of U.S. 183 this morning in the 8400 block of Research Boulevard.</p>

<p>Police said that officials received a call about the accident at 4:18 a.m. </p>

<p>The motorcyclist, whom police identified as 27-year-old Eric Laufer, was found on the upper deck of U.S. 183 near North Lamar Blvd. Investigators think that Laufer was driving northbound on Research Boulevard when another vehicle struck his motorcycle and fled the scene. </p>

<p>Laufer was found on Research Boulevard when officials arrived and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he had been wearing a helmet and full protective gear at the time of the accident.</p>

<p>The motorcycle was found about a mile away on the east frontage road. Officials later found a blue GMC pickup they believe may have struck the motorcyclist, according to Lisa Cortinas, a police spokeswoman. Investigators are looking for its driver.</p>

<p>Northbound U.S. 183 was closed for a few hours while police investigated the accident but the road re-opened at 7:30 a.m. </p>

<p>Police ask that anyone with more information about the incident call vehicular homicide detectives at 974-4724. This accident is the city&#8217;s 38th traffic fatality in 2008. </p>

        	<p>A 15-year-old Austin girl died and six others were injured after their truck crashed while racing another vehicle early Saturday in southern Travis County, the Department of Public Safety said.</p>

<p>Emergency crews, including five ambulances, arrived at the accident scene on FM 812 shortly after 2 a.m. to find Brenda Salazar dead. The other six occupants of the truck, ages 11 to 19, were treated at Austin hospitals for injuries ranging from scrapes to broken bones. </p>

<p>The driver of the truck, Jose Rodriguez, 19, was charged with racing on the highway causing death, a second-degree felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison, and was being held in the Travis County Jail in lieu of $1 million bond. </p>

<p>Rodriguez, of Austin, also was charged with failure to identify, a Class C misdemeanor, because he gave officers a false name, according to an arrest affidavit.</p>

<p>According to DPS, Rodriguez was racing a 2002 Ford Explorer pickup truck westbound on FM 812 toward U.S. 183 when the vehicle entered the opposite lane of traffic and struck a ditch. None of the truck&#8217;s occupants were wearing seat belts, DPS said, though nobody was ejected from the Explorer.</p>

<p>The other vehicle, which left the scene, was identified only as a red Honda. DPS troopers are investigating. </p>

<p>Rodriguez, the driver, was treated for abrasions at University Medical Center at Brackenridge.</p>

<p>Passenger Brandon Guzman, 16, of Austin, also was taken to Brackenridge with a fractured skull and wrist. </p>

<p>Karina Guajardo-Gutierrez, 13, of Austin, was taken to Dell Children&#8217;s Medical Center and was in stable condition with bruises. </p>

<p>Luis Torres-Moreno, 13, of Austin, also was taken to Dell. He was in stable condition with minor scrapes and bruises.</p>

<p>Diego Salazar, 11, of Austin, was taken to Dell and was in stable condition with broken bones.</p>

<p>Jose Gutierrez-Guajardo, 11, of Austin, was taken to Dell and suffered minor scratches and abrasions. </p>

<p>DPS could not say whether the passengers were related.      </p>

CAMP MABRY, Texas (Aug 5. 2008) - Sgt. Jaime Gonzalez, (age 40), from Austin, Texas, died Aug 3, 2008 while conducting duties as part of a security team. Fatal injuries were sustained when his convoy encountered an Improvised Explosive Device in the vicinity of Kabul, Afghanistan.   He is the fifth combat fatality in the Texas Army National Guard since World War II.</p>

<p>Sergeant Gonzalez entered military service as a sailor in the United States Navy on November 20, 1989.

The unit spent more than two months at Ft Bragg, North Carolina, conducting training in preparation for its overseas mission.  Its assigned mission was to provide Security Forces for Camp Eggers, Kabul, Afghanistan.  Sergeant Gonzalez&#8217;s death is the first to occur amongst the members of this unit which continues to serve in theater.</p>

        	<p>The Austin Fire Department is investigating an accident that ended in a car fire that may have killed a man in his 70s on Monday, spokeswoman Michelle DeCrane said this morning. </p>

<p>Fire officials are investigating the incident as a fire fatality, she said, because officials do not believe he died as a result of the traffic crash. The Travis County medical examiner&#8217;s office has not released a cause of death for the man and his name has not been released. </p>

<p>Police spokesman Sgt. Richard Stresing said that around 3:18 p.m. Monday, police received several reports of a minivan that had gone off the road in the 6300 block of Mountain Shadows Drive near Old Bee Cave Road. </p>

<p>The driver of the minivan reportedly &#8220;had several minor crashes with cars&#8221; as he drove westbound in the eastbound lanes of Texas 71, Stresing said. He said witnesses saw the van go off the road and try to back up his minivan. The man was revving the engine for several minutes before witnesses told police there was a loud pop and the engine caught fire, Stresing said. He said the driver tried to exit the vehicle but collapsed next to the driver&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>Stresing said officers found the minivan located in a field at the dead end of Mountain Shadows Drive. He said the driver was &#8220;burned beyond recognition after the car collided with a tree.&#8221; There were no other occupants in the car at the time.</p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2008/08/01/4yearold_drowning_victim_ident.html">4-year-old drowning victim identified</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>The Travis County sheriff&#8217;s office has identified a 4-year-old boy who apparently drowned in the swimming pool of an apartment complex Thursday as Xander Charles Drayton. </p>

<p>Roger Wade, a spokesman for the sheriff&#8217;s office, said that emergency medical workers were called to the Retreat at Wells Branch apartments at 2:49 p.m. by a neighbor who said there was a possible drowning. </p>

<p>EMS workers instructed a witness over the phone how to perform CPR, but when emergency personnel arrived the boy was pronounced dead at 3:16 p.m. Wade said.</p>

<p>Wade said the boy was visiting relatives at the complex at 2801 Wells Branch Parkway. <br />
According to Wade, there had been a miscommunication between adults at the pool that led to Drayton being allowed to enter the pool unnoticed. Investigators said there is no way to know how long the boy had been underwater before he was found because no one saw Drayton enter the pool. </p>

<p>The Travis County medical examiners office has preliminarily ruled his cause of death as accidental fresh water drowning. No charges are expected in the case, Wade said. </p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2008/07/31/_teen_killed_i.html">Teen killed in auto-pedestrian accident</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>Department of Public Safety officials say a 15-year-old Dripping Springs student was struck and killed in Hays County last night at around 9 p.m.</p>

<p>Tom Vinger, a DPS spokesman, said that a teenager was riding a bicycle towing a wagon along the road near the intersection of Nutty Brown and Signal Hill when Ronald Lair, 62, of Austin, struck 15-year-old Joshua Carroll Gregg, who was riding in the wagon, Vinger said. </p>

<div style="float: right;"><a href="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/blotter/upload/2008/07/_teen_killed_i/Lair%2C-Ronald.jpg"><img src="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/blotter/upload/2008/07/_teen_killed_i/Lair%2C-Ronald-thumb.jpg" width="104" height="130" alt="Lair,-Ronald.jpg"/></a></div>

<p>The boy on the bike saw the car coming, threw himself from the bike and had minor injuries, Vinger said. His name was not released. </p>

<p>Lair, who was driving a 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix, was arrested at the scene and charged with driving while intoxicated, Vinger said. He was taken to Hays County Jail. It was not immediately known whether he was still in custody. </p>

<p>Gregg was taken to Dell Children&#8217;s Medical Center of Central Texas, where he died from his injuries at 3:40 a.m. As a result of Gregg&#8217;s death, Vinger said, &#8220;We anticipate upgrading the charge to intoxication manslaughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greg Jung, assistant superintendent with Dripping Springs Independent School District said that Gregg had been a student at Dripping Springs Middle School and was scheduled to start attending high school there in August. School officials sent out a letter to parents in the district saying that counselors will be available in the community in coming weeks as needed.</p>

<p>Superintendent Mark Herrick released a statement notifying parents and community members of Gregg&#8217;s death. He said counselors will be available for students and staff in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>&#8220;We are saddened to inform you of the death of one of our students, Joshua Carroll Gregg,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;On behalf of the entire Dripping Springs I.S.D. family, I wish to express our deepest sympathy to Joshua&#8217;s family and friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The accident is under investigation. </p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2008/07/21/dps_motorist_involved_in_bastr.html">DPS: Driver in fatal Bastrop crash had drugs in system</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>The Department of Public Safety has released new details in a crash that killed a Bastrop man, a woman and two of her three daughters in April. </p>

<p>Cara Crisler, 27, of Cedar Park, died April 30 after she and her family were involved in a head-on collision with a Jeep Grand Cherokee driven by 38-year-old Darrell Avery. Officials said Avery was driving a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee north on Texas 304 and Crisler was driving south in a 2008 Ford Excursion. The Jeep crossed into the southbound lane and struck the Ford head-on around 6:45 p.m. on April 29, officials said.</p>

<p>According to a crash report released Friday by DPS, Avery had cannabis and a narcotic analgesic in his system at the time of the crash. Though the report does not say what type of narcotic was detected in Avery&#8217;s blood, types of drugs known as narcotic analgesics are pain relievers such as Vicodin.</p>

<p>Eight-year-old Kelsey Nicole Harris died at Dell Children&#8217;s Medical Center in Austin shortly after the wreck, Vinger said. Talena Harris, 4, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Avery also died in the crash. DPS investigators said he had been driving on the wrong side of the road in a no passing zone. Avery was a Bastrop resident but his driver&#8217;s license showed his most recent address as being in Arkansas, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger has said. </p>

        	<p>A Llano High School student died in a rollover wreck on Texas 71 Tuesday night, Department of Public Safety dispatcher Allen Muller said. </p>

<p>Three other teens were injured in the wreck about nine miles east of Llano at about 10 p.m., Muller said. </p>

<p>Corey Wunderlich was driving a 2001 Ford pickup truck east on Texas 71 when the truck went off the right side of the road, Muller said. Wunderlich overcorrected and veered across both lanes of the highway, Muller said. The truck went into a ditch, where it struck and climbed an enbankment. After descending the embankment, the truck  rolled back across both lanes of traffic.</p>

<p>Muller said the truck came to rest upright in another ditch. </p>

<p>Cassie Mae Zavadil, 16, was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:38 p.m. Muller said she was not wearing a seatbelt. Wunderlich was taken to University Medical Center at Brackenrige hospital, where he was treated and released. </p>

<p>Two passengers in the truck were hospitalized. As of Wednesday afternoon, David Justin Logan, 17, of Llano was in critical condition at University Medical Center at Brackenridge hospital. Terry William Inman, 16, also of Llano, was taken to Llano Memorial Hospital. His condition was not immediately known. Muller said it was unclear whether Logan or Inman were wearing seatbelts. </p>

        	<p>Investigators say 19-year-old Kenneth Sweeney Jr. died from his injuries after the pickup truck he was driving struck at least three other vehicles on FM 812 in South Travis County Tuesday. </p>

<p>The accident happened just after 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, a dispatcher with the Department of Public Safety said, just east of Maha Loop Road. The 2000 Chevrolet pickup Sweeney was driving and a 2003 Dodge pickup truck were going westbound on FM 812, officials said, as a 2004 Toyota pickup truck towing a homemade trailer and a 1993 Nissan were driving eastbound on FM 812. </p>

<p>Sweeney struck the back of the Dodge pickup, a dispatcher said, and then crossed over into the eastbound lane and struck the Toyota and the Nissan. DPS officials said rainy conditions at the time of the accident may have been a factor. </p>

<p>The Toyota and Nissan drivers, Del Valle residents Charles Johnson, 51, and Raul Rendon, 23, were not badly injured, according to DPS. </p>

        	<p>As New Braunfels High School seniors prepare for graduation tonight, they mourn the death of Guillermo Eduardo Farias, a 54-year-old social studies teacher who drowned near South Padre Island over Memorial Day weekend.</p>

<p>Farias, a father of four, had gathered with his family at Isla Buena Park on Saturday morning and went swimming with one of his daughters, according to Cameron County Parks Police Chief Juan Mendoza. Farias and his daughter, Sara, 21, got caught in a rip current; Sara swam to safety but Farias became too exhausted to swim, Mendoza said.</p>

<p>Around noon Saturday, Mendoza said, Farias was spotted by a surfer who took Farias to shore and tried to resuscitate him. Farias was taken to Valley Regional Hospital where he was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>New Braunfels school district spokeswoman Stephanie Ferguson said Farias and his family had moved to New Braunfels a year ago. His wife, Laura, is also a teacher with the school district. </p>

<p>&#8220;He was a teacher who had been with us for a very short time, but in that short time he made a big impact on the students that will last a lifetime,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;The students respected him tremendously. He made an incredible impact on their lives. He was a great guy.&#8221; </p>

<p>Funeral services were held for Farias in Laredo on Wednesday. Ferguson said the high school is planning a memorial service to be held sometime this summer. </p>

        	<p>Travis County investigators have identified a 42-year-old man found hanging by a safety wire from a cell phone tower in Southwest Austin on Wednesday as Warren Todd Dronebarger, but they still have not determined how he ended up suspended from the cable.</p>

<p>Dronebarger&#8217;s body was discovered by a neighbor at 8:15 a.m. in the 7600 block of Thomas Springs Road, near the Y in Oak Hill, Travis County sheriff&#8217;s office spokesman Roger Wade said. When the man was found, he was suspended 30 feet from the ground by a safety cable around his neck. </p>

<p>The Travis County medical examiner&#8217;s office said this morning that Dronebarger appears to have died from positional asphyxia &#8212; he had been hanging upside down for an extended period, which did not allow him to breathe &#8212; but his official cause of death has not been determined. Wade said investigators do not suspect foul play in Dronebarger&#8217;s death. </p>

<p>Police said road rage may have been a factor in the wreck. According to witnesses, the motorcyclist appeared to have gotten off his bike and exchanged words with the driver of a 4-door Kia sedan at the intersection of Kyle Parkway and the east frontage road on Interstate 35. Soon after, the car headed south, &#8220;accelerating pretty fast and it appeared to be chasing the motorcycle,&#8221; said Captain Pedro Hernandez of the Kyle Police Department.</p>

<p>The car drove off the road onto a patch of grass, but when the driver attempted to get back on the road, he lost control of the vehicle and crossed into the northbound lane of traffic, hitting the rear tires of an 18-wheeler. Estevan Olivares, 2, was killed in the crash, officials said.</p>

<p>Police are looking for the motorcyclist and are asking him to come forward as a witness. The bike is described as a brown custom chopper-style motorcycle with orange flames. </p>

<p>There were six people in the car, police said, including driver Richard Nunez, 17, Michael Roark, 18, Cynthia Garcia, age unavailable, and Rene Hernandez, 1. The four adults were admitted to University Medical Center at Brackenridge. The name of a fifth adult was not released. The 1-year-old was not injured, police said.</p>

<p>Anyone with information on the crash is asked to call (512) 268-0859.</p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2008/05/02/police_say_driver_charged_in_m.html">Police say driver charged in motorcycle hit and run faces additional charges</a></h3>
		
	

        	<p>Austin police have brought a new charge, tampering with physical evidence, against 47-year-old Jimmie Roger Stanley, who is accused of leaving the scene of a fatality accident on Wednesday morning. </p>

<p>Stanley was arrested and charged with failing to stop and render aid, a state jail felony,  after his semi-truck was rear-ended by a motorcycle on Interstate 35 near U.S. 183 just after 2 a.m. Wednesday. </p>

<p>Police said traffic had begun slowing down and merging into two lanes as motorists drove closer to a roadwork construction area when the motorcyclist collided with Stanley&#8217;s vehicle. </p>

<p>The man driving the motorcycle died at the scene, police said. He was identified today as Troy D. Uranga, 24.</p>

<p>According to an arrest warrant affidavit, Stanley drove away from the scene. </p>

<p>The affidavit says that Stanley called a mechanic at 3:30 a.m. after the collision to repair rear damage to the semi-truck. When the mechanic started working on the damage to the bent bumper, the affidavit says, a shoe dropped to the ground. The man fixing the truck also said he noticed blood and other evidence on the fender. He called his supervisor, who then called police. </p>

<p>&#8220;It turned out to be a 6-12 inch piece of human leg bone,&#8221; the affidavit says, which belonged to Uranga.</p>

<p>Tampering with or fabricating evidence is a third degree felony. If Stanley is convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison. </p>

	<h3><a href="/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2008/04/30/a_man_and_two_children_die_in.html">Mom, 2 kids among 4 dead in Bastrop crash</a></h3>
	

        	<p>Two little girls and a 38-year-old man were killed when a Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Ford Excursion collided on Texas 304 three miles south of Bastrop on Tuesday night, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety said this morning. </p>

<p>Bastrop resident Darrell Avery, the driver of the Jeep, died at the scene, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said. </p>

<p>Cara Crisler, 27, of Cedar Park, who was driving the Ford, was taken to the University Medical Center at Brackenridge with head injuries, Vinger said. Crisler died shortly after 10 a.m. this morning, Vinger said. </p>

<p>The two-vehicle accident happened at 6:45 p.m. Tuesday. Officials said Avery was driving a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee northbound on Texas 304 and Crisler was driving southbound in a 2008 Ford Excursion. The Jeep crossed into the southbound lane and struck the Ford head on, according to the dispatcher. Witnesses told DPS that Avery had been driving erratically before the accident. </p>

<p>According to a preliminary investigation, only Crisler was wearing a seatbelt in the Excursion, Vinger said. Kevin Harris was treated at Brackenridge and released, Crowther said. Vinger said that Harris and Crisler had recently moved from Cedar Park to Bastrop.</p>

<p>Eight-year-old Kelsey Harris died at Dell&#8217;s Children Hospital shortly after the accident, Vinger said. Talena Harris, 4,  was pronounced dead at the scene. Marissa Harris, 6, was injured in the crash and taken to Dell&#8217;s Children Hospital, where she is currently listed in good condition, Crowther said. </p>
