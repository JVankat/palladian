<TD VALIGN=TOP>In this brief essay, I want to suggest some of the ways
that the study of American literature is enhanced and transformed with
the use of electronic tools and technology resources. En route to that
I want to begin with the idea that the pedagogy and methods at the heart
of the <I>Heath Anthology</I> already have great affinity with the shape
and potential of electronic environments. Another way to put this is to
claim that the <I>Heath Anthology of American Literature</I>, with its
size, richness, and multiple voices demonstrates that the study of American
literature has outgrown &quot;the book.&quot; By this I mean that from
the beginning, the paradigm of American literature that held together the
two <I>Heath</I> volumes came from some place beyond the idea that there
was a single &quot;story&quot; of American literature to tell, or a fixed,
singular narrative of the &quot;rise&quot; of American expression, or an
agreed upon range of texts that represented the best of American creative
output. As John Alberti points out, the construction of the Anthology on
a multicultural and &quot;historically-grounded rhetorical approach&quot;
marks a shift from themes and works to &quot;an emphasis on process, on
discursive confrontation, negotiation and revision.&quot; The arrangement
and framing of texts within the <I>Heath</I>, often under headings like
<A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/colonial.html#tales">&quot;Tales
of Incorporation, Resistance, and Reconquest,&quot;</A> and <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/eighteen#boundry.html">&quot;</A><A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/eighteen.html#boundry">Contested
Boundaries,&quot;</A> while focusing readings around these central &quot;problems&quot;
point as well to the impossibility any longer of finding a single organization
for what is really a web of interrelationships among readings. There is
no longer a single point of origin with which to begin, nor a single line
of literary historical development to follow, but an array of &quot;contingent
centers&quot; that might shift from period to period and from course to
course. One might read <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/emerson.html">Ralph
Waldo Emerson</A> at the center of the so-called &quot;American Renaissance,&quot;
or alternatively, in parallel with <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/douglass.html">Frederick
Douglass</A> and <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/jacobs.html">Harriet
Jacobs</A> for competing versions of self-identity and personhood, or as
just another voice in a tangle of political and rhetorical cultures of
the 1840's that include the voices of the rising <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/reader_tc.html#women">Women's
movement</A>, antebellum reform movements such as <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/reader_tc.html#afam">abolitionism</A>,
and the incipient discourse of modern journalism, science, and philosophy.
One instructor's focal point is another instructor's glancing look; one
instructor's passing theme is another's organizational principle for the
unit. The <I>Heath Anthology</I> particularly encourages this range of
approaches because, in this sense, the view of American literature underwriting
the <I>Heath</I> is what we might call a &quot;post-print&quot; paradigm:
not linear but multilinear, not univocal but dialogic, organized not to
tell a story, but to open up a complicated matrix of issues and perspectives.
</TD>

<TD>Once an anthology ceases to be a story it also certainly ceases to
be a book. That is, in the way that the phone book is not really a book,
but a database, the <I>Heath Anthology</I> is more of a multivocal archive
of American expression. In this sense, the <I>Heath Anthology</I> represents
a new &quot;delivery mechanism&quot; for representing a massive shift in
(as I've called it elsewhere) the relationship between &quot;the story
and the archive.&quot; I mean the phrase &quot;the story and the archive&quot;
rather locally in the context of a single historical or analytic narrative
about a period, event, biography, or cultural pattern. I also use the phrase
more broadly, to imply how we define and teach larger patterns of social,
cultural, and literary history and the multiplicity of voices, political
and rhetorical cultures, and artifactual materials from which we draw the
elements of those patterns. A syllabus can be a narrative (or &quot;story&quot;)
as can a monograph or textbook. So too can a canon.
<P>Speaking about the impact of multiculturalism in literary studies on
classroom practice, John Alberti has commented, &quot;Clearly, the movement
to change the direction and focus of study in American literature has radical
practical and, therefore, theoretical implications for pedagogy, as will
be evident to any teacher replacing a traditional anthology of American
literature representing fifty or so authors (predominantly male, northern
European, Protestant and middle- to upper-class) with the overone hundred
thirty voices found in the <I>Heath Anthology </I>[of American Literature]--voices
originating in Zuni, Spanish, Chinese and English, in the experiences of
both colonized and colonizer, immigrant and Native America, rich and poor.&quot;
</P>

<P>In the shift from a traditional to an expansive anthology there is a
qualitative, not merely quantitative, change. As Kevin Kelly puts it over
and over again in his influential book on society in the network age: &quot;More
is different.&quot; In a literary anthology, the difference is more than
a growth from 50 to 130 authors; it is more, even, than the cultural politics
of that expansion. The difference is a exponential multiplier of possibilities
now that a whole new order of possible relationships, of valid textualities,
and of visible cultures are at the center of knowledge reproduction in
a particular field. The print versions of a literary anthology gives a
material reality to the politics of knowledge production; that is, the
politics of canonicity that inform the literary anthology are inseparable
from the book as a material object. That fact bears seriously on the future
of electronic texts and online cultural resources. The knowledge embodied
within a literary anthology has everything to do with capabilities of that
medium to bear the pressure of expansion within the strength of its binding,
size of its font, and the thickness of pages, as well as the protocols
of the genre and standards of curricula. The relationship between an anthology
and its level of canonical (or noncanonical) representation perfectly exemplifies,
as Peter Lyman puts it, the &quot;phenomenological link between the technical
format of a text, the rhetorical rules within which it is constructed,
and its content.&quot; The point here is simple: in print, an expansive
anthology can only expand as far as its physical constraints. And the <I>Heath</I>
is crying to burst its boundaries.</P>

<P>So, it is with this in mind I want to explore some of the ways that
electronic resources can supplement and integrate with the <I>Heath</I>.
It is not merely that new electronic tools are useful to support the <I>Heath</I>
<I>Anthology</I>, but to support the <I>Heath</I>'s project. That is, there
is a real, fundamental and logical connection between the tools of electronic
textuality and knowledge on the one hand, and new forms of pedagogy, course
organizations, and strategies of reading implied by <A NAME="texts"></A>the
<I>Heath Anthology</I>, on the other. Let me briefly suggest some of these
connections here.</P>

<TD VALIGN=TOP>In a recent paper delivered at the MLA, Paul Lauter speculated
about the 10th edition of the <I>Heath Anthology</I>, published well into
the 21st century. It would be, he asserted only half-jokingly, entirely
online in electronic form, with teachers and students downloading the texts
they needed at will to suit their curricular needs and intellectual interests.
Whether or not that will be the case, it is already true that electronic
environments can supplement the <I>Heath Anthology</I> directly by providing
access to an even wider variety of texts that can be placed online. Now
more than ever the texts in the <I>Heath Anthology</I> can be pointers
or starting points for more texts. Many of the difficult editorial selections
that are made with each edition can be eased with online access to some
of the omitted texts (especially out of copyright texts). Increasingly,
with more and more texts online, the Anthology serves as an organizational
foreground (or front end) for the broader &quot;archive&quot; available
throughout the Internet and in other electronic formats. Whether this extended
access to additional primary texts is used by students during the semester
(or for in depth semester projects), or by teachers seeking to supplement
their classroom practices, it can be seen as an extension of the expansiveness
that <A NAME="engage"></A>the <I>Heath</I> offered in the first place.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE=+1>Engaging Reading</FONT></TD>

<TD></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP>And yet, to invoke Kevin Kelley once more, &quot;more is
different.&quot; While there is inherent value in having access to a wide
diversity of texts, what ultimately matters is the qualitative changes
that access to that diversity enables. Regardless of how many texts are
in an Anthology or online, teachers and students always have to work with
the limitations of time and attention. The issues that face faculty in
confronting a broadly expansive American literature is how to engage students
in this abundance and diverstiy without overwhelming them. Throughout this
Instructor's Manual, and throughout the <I>Heath Anthology</I>'s electronic
resources there are many perspectives and suggestions for ways to do that.
And it has certainly been the experience of faculty who have worked with
electronic texts and new technologies that the tools and resources of new
media can play a significant role in that process of engagement. 
<P>One of the great advantages to having electronic texts available isn't
simply to access them, read them online, or download them and print them.
Having literary and rhetorical texts in electronic form is beneficial because
it allows you to do something with them: to search them, manipulate them,
annotate them, to make them into hypertexts, to write productive connections
between them, to make visible (through electronic linkages) connections
between them. In short, new technologies can be used to enable students
to develop a more direct relationship to materials. In his online essay,
<A HREF="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/public/jjm2f/rationale.html">&quot;Rationale
of Hypertext,&quot;</A> Jerome McGann talks about how the ways that we
study cultural texts is changing because the &quot;scale of our tools&quot;
is changing. I think this is an important point for the use of electronic
tools with novice learners as well. One of the most striking things that
I've found in asking students to use electronic tools to engage with cultural
and historical materials, is how these tools change the scale of the student's
relationship to those materials. As faculty who have degrees in the humanities,
we tend to forget (or perhaps we never knew) what it meant to feel powerless
in front of a text. Electronic tools of various kinds (and student work
with texts in electronic environments) help shift the balance of power
between students and texts. And that would seem to be the fundamental idea
behind the <I>Heath</I> itself. </P>

<P>For example, when students are working with a hypertext cd-rom on American
cultural history, or an electronic (word-searchable) version of a literary
text, they are able to manipulate the material according to their interest
or to ask questions of it and quick results. One of my earliest experiences
with this was working with an electronic text version of <A HREF="Frame: http://www.msstate.edu/Archives/History/USA/Afro-Amer/duglas11.txt">Frederick
Douglass' <I>Narrative</I></A>. With the word searching program we were
using, students could interrogate the text for rhetorical patterns, looking
for example of all instances of the word &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;human&quot;
in the same paragraph. (It turns out that Douglass almost never uses the
word human except in the same paragraph as a form of the word &quot;slave&quot;--but
often to different semantic effect. ) Now, as a matter of course, I have
students doing various kinds of word searches with electronic versions
of texts, often working in pairs to identify common language in two texts
assigned for a particular class day. Once having found a common term or
phrase, students must then write a short paragraph about how the word(s)
function in the respective texts. The role of the electronic search tools
in this process is key in my opinion. Students working with the electronic
version of a primary text are able to exercise a form of control over that
text that expert learners develop over many readings. My experience (and
the experience of other faculty using similar tools) is not that such tools
are the &quot;easy way out,&quot; but the reverse: that such exercises
tend to bring students back to their printed texts with a heightened sense
of language, and a greater interest in interrogating the text for patterns.
</P>

<P>Doing work with electronic texts is merely one among many ways for students
in introductory classes to make use of new technologies. Similarly students
who are using an online archive of primary materials on the World Wide
Web are able to work their way through the kind of scholarly resource which
only experts in the field would previously have had access. The scale of
these new tools allows novice learners to get closer to seeing key texts
as ideas situated in a complexity, and to use those tools as prosthetics
for searching and sorting through possibilities and contengcies, en route
to performing authentic analysis and synthesis. This is the phenomenon
that I call the 'novice in the archive.' If one of the implications of
a new American literature is a shift from &quot;themes&quot; to &quot;reading
practices,&quot; then student engagement with primary cultural materials
in a rich electronic environment can be one path to the development of
such practices. The unique opportunity with electronic, simulated archives
is to create open but guided experiences for students that would be difficult
or impractical to replicate in most library environments. It is, as always,
not merely the access to materials that matters, but structured activities
where <A NAME="tchyp"></A>students do sort through &quot;possibilities
and contingencies&quot; that speak to new pedagogical practices.</P>

<TD VALIGN=TOP>It is fair to say that the &quot;rhetorically-based approach&quot;
that the <I>Heath Anthology</I> demands asks that students focus both inward
and outward. That is, students read a wide variety of literatures that
have a range of social, historical, and cultural contexts needs both to
learn to read closely and to begin to acquire strategies for connecting
texts to their broader contexts. John Alberti's essay emphasizes how &quot;the
rhetorical model of multicultural pedagogy, with its focus on how texts
operate as part of a field of historical discursive practices&quot; raises
important questions about &quot;integrating such socio-historical information
into the classroom.&quot; Particularly, he talks about how the need for
historical context to bring new and diverse texts into focus requires us
to &quot;rethink the distinction between background' and foreground' and
the very concept of understanding' a text&quot; itself.&quot; In order
to help students understand texts as part of a &quot;field of historically
discursive practices&quot; we need new strategies for helping students
place a text in a field of other texts. Electronic archives provide an
unusual opportunity for that to happen. 
<P>I'm not speaking of strictly literary texts, but other kinds of historical
texts, such as the online archival collections at the Library of Congress'
<A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/">National Digital Library</A>. Let's
consider a resource like the 25,000 images of the <A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/detroit/dethome.html">Detroit
Publishing Company's</A> collection of views of American life from 1890-1925.
How might these enhance the study of a work like Stephen Crane's <I>Maggie</I>,
or Anzia Yezierska's <I>The Bread Givers</I>, by offering a visual guide
to urbanization and immigration around the turn of the century? Or, might
a reading of early modern voices, especially the regional writers, be read
in the context of the <A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/wpaintro/wpahome.html">WPA
life histories</A>; or Depression writers like Meridel LeSeuer or John
Steinbeck be read in the context of an online archive of the <A HREF="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/fsowhome.html">Farm
Security Administration</A> photographs. As with the potential of electronic
literary texts, the accessibility of online archives provides opportunities
for students to &quot;make knowledge&quot; from them, connecting contextual
materials to literary texts, whether through small assignments where they
are asked to match passages form a literary work with photographs from
the same period, or more substantive research projects where they can use
primary materials that they locate on their own to build a context for
the texts on which they are focusing in class. </P>

<P>The use of electronic materials also suggests the ways that multiple
media can work together. Many American literature instructors bring slides,
cassettes, videos, into class. These materials have always enhanced the
study of literary texts. Electronic environments, however, offer even greater
opportunities to present mulitple media: they can often present mixed media
in effective &quot;combinations&quot; (i.e. as interactive multimedia),
and they can offer students the opportunity to work with multimedia and
&quot;make&quot; their own projects out of them. How, for example, might
it enhance the study of the jazz age and texts from the 1920's to have
students work with some of the growing number of excellent History of Jazz
web sites and cd-roms (see, for example, Dan Morgenstern's <A HREF="http://www.jazzcentralstation.com/jcs/station/newsstan/history/index.html">History
of Jazz</A>)? Or to have students work with the multimedia published edition
of the <A HREF="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/harlem/"><I>Survey</I> <I>Graphic</I>
Harlem Number</A> journal as well as the photographs of American life from
the 1920's? Or all of the above? How might an understanding of fiction
and poetry in the nineteenth century be enhanced by working with an electronic
version of the collections of the National Museum of American Art? Or sorting
through a range of 16th-century woodcuts and maps of the new world in tandem
with the literature of discovery and exploration? Interactive multimedia
not only promotes the richness of the printed texts in the <I>Heath</I>,
but affords an environment for student constructive projects, emphasizing
the process of knowledge creation (rather than the mastery of a single
tradition). Obviously each course context is very different in its capacity
to work with mulitmedia and electronic archival materials. The point is
merely that the widening cultural approach to American literature is naturally
moving toward the broader more constructive pedagogies that electronic
environments enable. </P>

<TD></TD>

<TD>Electronic environments, and the World Wide Web in particular, offer
a rich context for studying the multiple ways that cultural knowledge gets
appropriated and reproduced. Many important texts in the Heath are bridges
between socio-culutral contexts and the reproduction of popular culture
in various forms. If, for example, you were to explore the range of sites
devoted to the <A HREF="http://ng.netgate.net/~norberto/nican.html">Virgin
of Guadalupe</A> and you'll find a materials that range from the scholarly
to the devotional, including at least one that plays solemn church organ
music in the background. The Virgin of Guadalupe web sites give a vivid
glimpse into the living appropriation of cultural imate and can raise a
series of central and important questions about the force of the Virgin
in the new world and throughout latin catholic cultures. Looking at the
web resources available on Davy Crockett or <A HREF="http://www.netins.net/showcase/creative/lincoln/speeches/speeches.htm">Abraham
Lincoln</A> or the <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/decl.html">Declaration
of Independence</A>, or the <A HREF="http://www.wnet.org/federalist/papers.html">Federalist
Papers</A>, or <A HREF="http://info.pitt.edu/~lmitten/indians.html">Native
American Tribal sites</A>, or a whole host of other topics, offers a richly
suggestive array of activities in which you could engage students in the
critical dialogues of authority, power, origins, and national and cultural
identity that make up the web of interrelationships through the <I>Heath</I>'s
two volumes. 
<P>Finally, if the ultimate goal of an introductory American literature
course is teach students to build their own connections across diverse
texts, electronic environments are very suggestive as spaces in which to
represent that knowledge. Whether through standalone hypertext applications
or on the Web, increasing numbers of teachers and students are experimenting
with writing in nonlinear, hypertext environments. Hypertext papers and
projects (whether as electronically linked traditional papers' or as virtual
exhibitions of one kind or another) can help make vivid the web of connections
among texts and their contexts. As with the activities above, constructive
hypertext projects are further ways of engaging students in the <A NAME="distresp"></A>problems
and practices of the multiple literary cultures that make up American literature
studies.</P>

<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE=+1>Distributing the Responsibility for Making
Knowledge</FONT> <I><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></I></TD>

<TD></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP>In his &quot;Afterword&quot; to the second edition's Instructor's
Guide, Paul Lauter addressed the issue of &quot;power dynamics&quot; in
the classroom, and how the inevitable imbalances can be ameliorated. He
says, &quot;while differences in power cannot, in my judgement, be expunged,
responsibility, can more fully and sytematically be distributed. The goal
here, as Teresa McKenna has framed it, is to create a learning community
in which all participants are responsible for what is learned.&quot; This
concern speaks not only to issues of power, but back to issues of engagement.
How can students share more in the responsibility for making knowledge?
How can a student bring more information to class? How can students develop
habits that interrogate texts, rather than passively receive what teachers
tell them? How can students effectively teach each other, as part of a
process of discovery? The answers to these kinds of questions, of course,
involve teaching and learning strategies far more complicated than just
hte use of interactive technologies. But technologies can be one key element
in addressing them. 
<P>All of the activities implied above and many others can serve to distribute
the responsibility for making knowledge in the classroom. When students
work (individually or in pairs) with electronic texts, or online archives,
or multimedia materials, they have the opportunity to bring their own unique
information and perspective to class. Work in these media, especially in
combination with the use of other &quot;dialogic technologies,&quot; such
as electronic discussion lists, email, and web conferencing programs, further
enriches the ability of students to continuously engage in making connections
and meaning. The open and shared nature of electronic media helps students
learn to be accoutable for their ideas and puts the construction of knowledge
into a public sphere. This also seems to be in the spirit of an expanded
American literature and the new pedagogies implied by it. </P>

<TD></TD>

<TD>The distribution of responsibility also perfectly fits new media, like
the Internet, because it is a distributed, rather than a broadcast medium.
The challenge for the next decade in education, I believe, is to find where
a distributive medium like the web or a networked classroom, can mesh with
a distributive pedagogy that believes in collaborative and constructive
learning, in the context of what we might call a &quot;distributive epistemology&quot;--a
broadly distributed sense of where we find cultural knowledge, what we
count as a cultural voice, and what we consider a readable text. Whether
it is in classroom practice among peers, between teachers and students,
or among teachers and scholars in open electronic environments like the
<A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/tamlit/tamlit-home.html">&quot;Teaching
the American Literatures&quot;</A> discussion list and complementary faculty
development materials, the potential to make coherence out of expansion
lies in our ability as a community to make the most of this &quot;convergence&quot;
of distibutive effects. The Web, like <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/whitman.html">Whitman</A>,
contains multitudes. Can we make the most of it? </TD>
