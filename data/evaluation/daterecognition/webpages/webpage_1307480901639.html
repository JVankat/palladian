	<li><b>Best Known As:</b> The czar who modernized 18th century Russia</li>
</ul>
<p><p>Name at birth: Petr Alekseevich</p><p>Peter the Great was the Russian czar who transformed Russia from an isolated agricultural society into an Empire on a par with European powers. Peter was the son of Czar Alexis (Fedor III Alakseevich) and his second wife. After the death of Alexis, Peter and his half-brother Ivan were co-czars who served under the regency of Ivan's sister, Sophia. Ivan died and Peter outmaneuvered Sophia to rule alone as czar from 1689. Peter toured Europe (sometimes in disguise to avoid being recognized) and educated himself in western culture and science, then returned to Russia and introduced military, civil and social reforms to make Russia more like Europe (especially Germany). He spent much of his time fighting wars, first against the Turks of the Ottoman Empire, then (from 1700) against the Swedes in the Great Northern War. He succeeded in conquering land on the Baltic Sea, where he founded St. Petersburg. A gateway to Europe, St. Petersburg became the new capital of Russia. Peter was reportedly more than six and a half feet tall and was often in the battlefield, occasionally returning home to address domestic issues and put down revolts. In 1725 he dove in the water to help rescue some drowning sailors; he ended up with a bad cold and died a short time later.</p></p>

<p>St. Petersburg was renamed Petrograd in 1914, then renamed Leningrad after the death of <a href="/main/ntq-dsid-1648-dekey-vilenin" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">V. I. Lenin</a> (1924). In 1991 it was changed back to St. Petersburg...Peter often criticized his son, Alexei, for being incompetent and lazy, but apparently thought he was energetic enough to mount a coup attempt: Peter had Alexei arrested and sentenced to death, but Alexei died before he could be executed.</p>

<p><span class="shw">Peter ‘the Great’, Tsar</span> (1682) and Emperor (1721) of Russia (1672-1725) Statesman, military leader, and diplomat, founder of Russian power and influence in Europe, of the regular Russian army and fleet, and of a national arms industry. Born Peter Alekseyevich Romanov, the son of Tsar Aleksey Mikhaylovich by his second wife, Peter was in constant danger from his half-sister Sofia and in 1682 he and his mother retreated to the village of Preobrazhenskoy near Moscow. Young Peter was fascinated by militaria and was soon drilling his own <i>poteshnye</i>—‘play soldiers’—recruited from his friends and experimenting with an old sailing boat, the origin of the Russian navy. In 1687 the <i>poteshnye</i> were reinforced by drafting men from the old <a href="/topic/streltsy-modeuro-in-encyclopedia" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">streltsy</a> regiments of Moscow and formed into two new, western-style regiments of the Imperial Guard, the Preobrazhenskiy and Semenovskiy.<br/><br/>In 1695 and 1696 Peter and his evolving army made two expeditions to the Turkish-held stronghold of Azov, in the south, the second of which was successful, establishing Russian power on the Sea of Azov. From March 1697 to July 1698 Peter made his famous incognito trip to the west, visiting Sweden, Prussia, Holland, and England and building up a vast store of naval, military, and scientific knowledge for his later reforms. His trip was curtailed by news of the final streltsy revolt. Peter then completed the transformation to a modern regular army on the western model, which had begun under his father, Tsar Aleksey. His strategic focus also shifted west, towards Europe and access to it via the Baltic, with the <a href="/topic/northern-wars" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Great Northern war</a>. Peter's new army saw its first action against the Swedes at Narva in 1700, but clearly had much to learn. They surrounded the Swedish fortress with about 34, 000 troops but the Swedish relief force, emerging from the woods, only 11, 000 strong, tore into them, killing up to 8, 000 and capturing all their artillery. Although Narva was a disaster, Peter continued his strategy of dominating the Gulf of Finland and securing access to the sea. By 1703 the Russians had the eastern end of the Gulf, and on 16 May the foundation stone of the Petropavlovsk—Peter and Paul—fortress was laid on the estuary of the river Neva. The growing settlement around was called Sankt Peter Burk, in Dutch: St Petersburg.<br/><br/>At <a href="/topic/battle-of-poltava" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Poltava</a> on 27 June 1709, the first battle where Peter took personal command, the new Russian army scored its first victory over a western army, and one of Russia's greatest military triumphs. The Swedes, led by <a href="/topic/charles-xii" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Charles XII</a>, by now outnumbered nearly two to one and short of ammunition, nevertheless attacked a strongly defended Russian camp, and lost about half their strength killed and wounded. Historically, the Russians had been considered cowardly, lazy, and better at <a href="/topic/siege-warfare" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">siege warfare</a> than in the open field. This battle announced a new style.<br/><br/>In the ensuing years, Russia grew stronger, and foreign observers, including the Hanoverians and the English, newly joined, expressed anxiety about the growth of Russian power. Towards the end of his reign, Peter again turned south, seizing Derbent in 1722 and Baku and Reshut in 1723, gains recognized by the Persians and the <a href="/topic/seljuk-and-ottoman-turks" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Turks</a>. The creation of three new fleets reflected the strategic direction of Peter's campaigns: the Baltic, the Azov, and the Caspian. The Baltic was the biggest and, by the end of the Great Northern war, had 124 Russian-built craft and 55 taken from the Swedes, including twenty sail of the line. Because the waters of the Baltic and the Sea of Azov were often shallow, galleys proved especially useful and Peter had 416 by the end of the Northern war. Although Peter drew much from foreign advisers, especially Scotsmen like Patrick Gordon, James Bruce, and G. B. Ogilvy, and the Swiss Franz Lefort, he also thought profoundly and wrote at length about the art of war. The <i>Code of 1716</i> and <i>Rules of Combat</i> (1708) were his own work and drew heavily on his own experience. By the end of his reign Russia, according to a French diplomat writing to <a href="/topic/louis-xiv-of-france" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Louis XIV</a> in 1723, ‘whose very name was scarcely known, has now become the object of attention of the greater powers of Europe, who solicit its friendship’.</p>

<p><blockquote><i>Peter I (1672-1725), called Peter the Great, was czar of Russia from 1682 to 1725. His reign was marked by a program of extensive reform known as Westernization and by the establishment of Russia as a major European power.</i></blockquote></p><p>Contemporaries abroad tended to admire Peter I for his reforms and to fear him because of his country's growing power, but his reforms were generally unpopular with his subjects, not only because they entailed higher taxes and harder work for almost everyone but also because they disturbed ancient religious and cultural traditions. After his death, Russians soon came to realize that Peter had been the country's greatest ruler and that his reign had indeed been a high point in their history. That evaluation is still generally accepted by historians.</p><p>Peter was born in Moscow on May 30, 1672, the only son of Czar Alexis and his second wife, Natalia Naryshkin. The 13 children of Alexis' previous marriage included 3 who became prominent during Peter's youth: able and ambitious Sophia, half-blind and half-witted Ivan, and amiable <a href="/topic/feodor" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Feodor</a>, who succeeded Alexis in 1676.</p><p>Peter's formal education, entrusted to private tutors, began when he was 7 but was interrupted 3 years later, when Czar Feodor died without having named an heir. Sophia and a small group of supporters favored the frail Ivan, her 15-year-old brother, to succeed Feodor. Another group favored the robust and intelligent Peter and at once proclaimed him <a href="/topic/czar" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">czar</a>, planning that his mother serve as regent. That arrangement was quickly upset, however, when Sophia received the help of the Moscow troops and compelled the installation of Ivan as "First Czar, " Peter as "Second Czar, " and herself as regent.</p><p class='shw'>Formative Years</p><p>During the next 7 years little was required of Peter except that he take part in formal ceremonies. Fascinated by military activities, he spent much time at games involving arms practice and battle <a href="/topic/maneuver" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">maneuvers</a>, at first with young friends and later with two regiments of soldiers that he was permitted to recruit and train. His curiosity and abundant energy led him also to the study and practice of the skills involved in navigation and such crafts as <a href="/topic/carpentry" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">carpentry</a>, stonecutting, and printing. In the course of these pursuits, he came into contact with a number of foreign residents and gained from them knowledge of the world outside Russia.</p><p>Disturbed by the trend of his development, Peter's mother mistakenly decided that she could change it by arranging for his marriage; at her direction, he was married to Eudoxia Lopukhin in January 1689. Still, he showed no <a href="/topic/inclination" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">inclination</a> to <a href="/topic/forgo" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">forgo</a> his first interests or his <a href="/topic/unconventional" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">unconventional</a> activities.</p><p>Political opposition to Sophia's regency came to a head during Peter's 17th year, and, impressed by the assurance of strong support if he would assert himself, Peter declared her office vacant and sent her away to a convent. That done, he returned to his <a href="/topic/habitual" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">habitual</a> pursuits and continued to neglect personal responsibilities, even after Eudoxia had borne him a son, Alexis, in 1690. By that time he was a striking figure, impressive as a potential ruler but with <a href="/topic/scant" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">scant</a> interest in the duties involved.</p><p>It was not until 1695, when he had his first taste of actual fighting, against the Turkish forces at <a href="/topic/sea-of-azov" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Azov</a>, that Peter began to give serious thought to the problems he faced as czar. The death of "First Czar" Ivan during the following year finally brought him close to the full import of his position.</p><p class='shw'>First Steps</p><p>Having been impressed at Azov by his country's lack of adequate fighting ships, Peter began with characteristic <a href="/topic/zeal" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">zeal</a> to plan for an efficient navy. He sent groups of young men to western European countries to study navigation and shipbuilding; then, in 1697, he himself followed - an unprecedented step for a Russian czar - to acquire <a href="/topic/firsthand" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">firsthand</a> information and to hire shipwrights for service in Russia. He visited Holland, England, Germany, and Austria. In those countries he was impressed not only by their technological superiority over Russia but also by what seemed to him a superior style of life. When he returned to Russia in 1698, he was ready to make many changes.</p><p>One of Peter's first acts was to order that men <a href="/topic/shave" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">shave</a> off their beards, and when he met <a href="/topic/stubborn" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">stubborn</a> resistance, he modified his order only to the extent of imposing a tax on those who chose to keep their beards. He also shattered tradition by requiring that the old Russian calendar (which reckoned time from the creation of the world) be abandoned in favor of the Julian calendar used in the West. At the same time, he was dealing with two other matters, a revolt among the Moscow troops and the <a href="/topic/annoying" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">annoying</a> presence of his <a href="/topic/unwanted" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">unwanted</a> wife, Eudoxia; he <a href="/topic/speedily-2" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">speedily</a> quelled the revolt with savage executions and terminated his marriage by forcing Eudoxia into a convent.</p><p class='shw'>Great Northern War</p><p>The handling of some of his problems, Peter soon learned, required more than his usual imperious tactics. During his European tour, he had obtained assurances of Western cooperation in forcing Sweden to cede the territory that Russia needed as an outlet to the Baltic Sea. He began the undertaking by a declaration of war on Sweden in 1700.</p><p>Peter led his forces in their first major encounter with the Swedes at <a href="/topic/narva" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Narva</a> in November 1700 and was severely defeated by inferior numbers. Resorting to the means he had used with the navy - <a href="/topic/remodel" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">remodeling</a> by Western patterns - he began at once to whip into shape a better organized, equipped, and trained army. In 1703 he led it to a redeeming victory and took from Sweden the mouth of the <a href="/topic/neva-river-geogrus-in-encyclopedia" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Neva River</a>. He designated the site for a city to be named St. Petersburg and to become the imperial capital. A year later he captured Narva.</p><p>Taking advantage of a few years of <a href="/topic/respite" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">respite</a> while the Swedes were engaged with other enemies, Peter worked purposefully to strengthen Russian arms and to keep under control the domestic <a href="/topic/discontent" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">discontent</a> that was breaking into open revolt in many areas, particularly along the Don and the Volga rivers. He was obliged to return to the war in mid-1709, however, to meet a Swedish invasion led by Charles XII. The opposing forces met at Poltava, where the Russians won a decisive victory. The battle did not end the war, but it marked a turning point and vindicated Peter's belief in his methods. Moreover, it had a profound psychological effect on the western European states, who now saw Russia as a formidable power.</p><p>Twelve years of <a href="/topic/indecisive" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">indecisive</a> hostilities followed the Poltava victory. In 1711 Peter had to <a href="/topic/divert" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">divert</a> some of his troops to the south, where the Turks, encouraged by Sweden, had attacked Russia. After a year of unsuccessful fighting, he had to cede the port of Azov, Russia's only point of access to the Black Sea. Meanwhile, intermittent fighting kept the main war going, and it was not until 1718 that Sweden reluctantly agreed to a consideration of peace terms. By the resulting Treaty of Nystad, signed in September 1721, Sweden ceded Ingria, Estonia, Livonia, and a portion of <a href="/topic/karelia" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Karelia</a>, thus giving Russia a firm <a href="/topic/foothold" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">foothold</a> on the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea. Since Peter had already established Russian influence in <a href="/topic/courland" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Courland</a>, his country was now a major Baltic power, having been provided with "a window to Europe" by the new acquisitions. In recognition of what he had achieved, the Russian Senate, a body created by Peter, conferred upon him the titles of "the Great" and "Emperor."</p><p class='shw'>Personal Problems</p><p>After he freed himself of Eudoxia, Peter became attracted to Catherine Skavrenska, a Lithuanian girl of humble origin, and married her secretly, delaying until 1712 the public recognition of her as his consort. When Catherine bore a son, the Czar had him christened Peter Petrovich and anticipated his succession to the throne. Alexis, the son by his first marriage, had become a lazy, weak-willed, and hostile young man who resisted being <a href="/topic/mold" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">molded</a> to his father's standards. In the belief that Alexis was actually plotting against the throne, Peter ordered that he be taken to prison; and there, after being questioned under torture, Alexis died. Yet the Czar's problem was not solved: in 1719 Peter Petrovich died, leaving him no son as successor. Alexis had left a son, Peter Alekseyevich; but the Czar chose to bypass him and to decree, in 1722, that thereafter each ruler of Russia was free to name his heir. It is probable that Peter intended to name his wife, Catherine, as his heir, but he continued to <a href="/topic/postpone" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">postpone</a> the formality.</p><p class='shw'>Domestic Reforms</p><p>Although Peter carried out many reforms in his early years as czar, his major work as a reformer was done in the last decade of his reign. His goal was to create a powerful and prosperous state, efficiently and <a href="/topic/honestly" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">honestly</a> administered, to which every subject could contribute. To achieve that goal, he refashioned many existing institutions and initiated new policies, generally guided by what he had learned of western Europe. He reorganized the country's entire administrative structure and promulgated the Table of Ranks, classifying civil service, military, and naval positions and providing for advancement on the basis of merit from lower to higher positions. He encouraged industry and commerce, spurred the development of science, and laid the foundations of the Academy of Sciences, which was established soon after his death. He instituted Russia's secular schools, eliminated the obsolete characters from the Russian alphabet, and established the country's first newspaper.</p><p>Even the Church felt the force of Peter's great energy. Although a religious man, he had no respect for the privileges accorded to the Church, was critical of many of its policies, and resented its resistance to his reforms. When Patriarch Adrian, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, died in 1700, Peter did not permit the <a href="/topic/vacancy" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">vacancy</a> to be filled. Finally, in 1721, he abolished the post of patriarch, substituting for it the Holy Synod, a board of prelates who were to direct the affairs of the Church under the supervision of a <a href="/topic/layman" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">layman</a> appointed by the czar.</p><p>Apparently, Peter found his greatest <a href="/topic/satisfaction" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">satisfaction</a> in the development of St. Petersburg. He intended that this modern city become the center of the new Russia as Moscow had been the center of the old. He declared it to be the country's new capital and gradually transferred to it the central administrative offices. Built in Western style rather than the traditional Russian, it provided a visible symbol of his reforms.</p><p class='shw'>Last Years</p><p>After the war with Sweden, Peter began to think seriously of his country's interests in Asia. At his direction, Russian forces conquered Kamchatka on the Pacific, and a Russian expedition explored the area now known as the Bering Strait. With prospects of more immediate value, he successfully pursued a war against Persia to strengthen Russia's position on the Caspian.</p><p>The treaty ending the war with Persia had yet to be ratified in 1724, when Peter's health began to fail rapidly. Characteristically, he continued to drive himself to the very limit of his strength, still postponing the designation of an heir. He died on Jan. 28, 1725, in the city that he had founded.</p><p class='shw'>Further Reading</p><p>A study of Peter I is L. Jay Oliva, <i>Russia in the Era of Peter the Great</i> (1969).

<p>(1672 - 1725), known as Peter the Great, tsar and emperor of Russia, 1682 - 1725.</p><p>The reign of Peter I is generally regarded as a watershed in Russian history, during which Russia expanded westward, became a leading player in European affairs, and underwent major reforms of its government, economy, religious affairs, and culture. Peter is regarded as a "modernizer" or "westernizer," who forced changes upon his often reluctant subjects. In 1846 the Russian historian Nikolai Pogodin wrote: "The Russia of today, that is to say, European Russia, diplomatic, political, military, commercial, industrial, <a href="/topic/scholastic" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">scholastic</a>, literary - is the creation of Peter the Great. Everywhere we look, we encounter this <a href="/topic/colossal" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">colossal</a> figure, who casts a long shadow over our entire past." Writers before and after agreed that Peter made a mark on the course of Russian history, although there has always been disagreement about whether his influence was positive or negative.</p><p class='shw'>Childhood and Youth</p><p>The only son of the second marriage of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich of Russia (r. 1645 - 1676) to Nathalie Kirillovna Naryshkina, Peter succeeded his half-brother Tsar Fyodor Alexeyevich (1676 - 1682) in May 1682. In June, following the bloody rebellion of the Moscow musketeers, in which members of his mother's family and government officials were massacred, he was crowned second tsar jointly with his elder, but severely <a href="/topic/handicapped" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">handicapped</a>, half-brother Ivan V. Kept out of government during the regency of his half-sister Sophia Alexeyevna (r. 1682 - 1689), Peter pursued personal interests that later fed into his public activities; these included meeting foreigners, learning to sail, and forming "play" troops under the command of foreign officers, which became the Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky guards. On Tsar Ivan's death in 1696, Peter found himself sole ruler and enjoyed his first military victory, the capture of the Turkish fortress at <a href="/topic/sea-of-azov" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Azov</a>, a success which was facilitated by a newly created fleet on the Don river. From 1697 to 1698 he made an unprecedented tour of Western Europe with the Grand Embassy, the official aim of which was to revive the Holy League against the Ottomans, which Russia had entered in 1686. Peter traveled <a href="/topic/incognito" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">incognito</a>, devoting much of his time to visiting major sites and institutions in his search for knowledge. He was particularly impressed with the Dutch Republic and England, where he studied shipbuilding. On his return, he forced his boyars to <a href="/topic/shave" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">shave</a> off their beards and adopt Western dress. In 1700 he discarded the old Byzantine creation calendar in favor of dating years in the Western manner from the birth of Christ. These symbolic acts set the agenda for cultural change.</p><p class='shw'>The Great Northern War, 1700 - 1721</p><p>After making peace with the Ottoman Empire in 1700, Peter declared war on Sweden with the aim of regaining a <a href="/topic/foothold" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">foothold</a> on the Baltic, in alliance with Denmark and King Augustus II of Poland. After some early defeats, notably at <a href="/topic/narva" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Narva</a> in 1700, and the loss of its allies, Russia eventually gained the upper hand over the Swedes. After Narva, King Charles XII abandoned his Russian campaign to pursue Augustus into Poland and Saxony, allowing Russia to advance in Ingria and Livonia. When he eventually invaded Russia via Ukraine in 1707 - 1708, Charles found his troops overextended, underprovisioned, and confronted by a much improved Russian army. Victory at Poltava in Ukraine in 1709 allowed Peter to stage a successful assault on Sweden's eastern Baltic ports, including Viborg, Riga, and Reval (Tallinn) in 1710. Defeat by the Turks on the river Pruth in 1711 forced him to return Azov (ratified in the 1713 Treaty of <a href="/topic/edirne" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Adrianople</a>), but did not prevent him pursuing the Swedish war both at the negotiating table and on campaign, for instance, in Finland in 1713 - 1714 and against Sweden's remaining possessions in northern Germany and the Swedish mainland. The Treaty of Nystadt (1721) ratified Russian possession of Livonia, Estonia, and Ingria. During the celebrations the Senate awarded Peter the titles Emperor, the Great, and Father of the Fatherland. In 1722 - 1723 Peter conducted a campaign against Persia on the Caspian, capturing the ports of Baku and Derbent. Russia's military successes were achieved chiefly by intensive recruitment, which allowed Peter to keep armies in the field over several decades; training by foreign officers; home production of weapons, especially artillery; and well-organized provisioning. The task was made easier by the availability of a <a href="/topic/servile" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">servile</a> peasant population and the obstacles which the Russian terrain and climate posed for the invading Swedes. The navy, <a href="/topic/staff" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">staffed</a> mainly by foreign officers on both home-built and purchased ships, provided an auxiliary force in the latter stages of the Northern War, although Peter's personal involvement in naval affairs has led some historians to exaggerate the fleet's importance. The galley fleet was particularly effective, as exemplified at Hango in 1714.</p><p class='shw'>Domestic Reforms</p><p>Many historians have argued that the demands of war were the driving force behind all Peter's reforms. He created the Senate in 1711, for example, to rule in his absence during the Turkish campaign. Among the ten new Swedish-inspired government departments, created between 1717 and 1720 and known as Colleges or collegiate boards, the Colleges of War, Admiralty, and Foreign Affairs consumed the bulk of state revenues, while the Colleges of Mines and Manufacturing concentrated on production for the war effort, operating iron works and manufacture of weapons, rope, canvas, uniforms, powder, and other products. The state remained the chief producer and customer, but Peter attempted to encourage individual enterprise by offering subsidies and exemptions. Free manpower was short, however, and in 1721 industrialists were allowed to purchase serfs for their factories. New provincial institutions, based on Swedish models and created in several <a href="/topic/restructuring" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">restructuring</a> programs, notably in 1708 - 1709 and 1718 - 1719, were intended to rationalize recruitment and tax collection, but were among the least successful of Peter's projects. As he said, money was the "<a href="/topic/artery" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">artery</a> of war." A number of <a href="/topic/piecemeal" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">piecemeal</a> fiscal measures culminated in 1724 with the introduction of the poll tax (initially 74 kopecks <a href="/topic/per-annum" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">per annum</a>), which replaced direct taxation based on households with assessment of individual males. Peter also encouraged foreign trade and diversified indirect taxes, which were attached to such items and services as official paper for contracts, private bathhouses, oak coffins, and beards (the 1705 beard tax). Duties from liquor, customs, and salt were profitable.</p><p>The Table of Ranks (1722) consolidated earlier legislation by dividing the service elite - army and navy officers, government and court officials - into three columns of fourteen ranks, each containing a variable number of posts. No post was supposed to be allocated to any candidate who was <a href="/topic/unqualified" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">unqualified</a> for the duties involved, but birth and marriage continued to confer privilege at court. The Table was intended to encourage the existing nobility to perform more efficiently, while endorsing the concept of nobles as natural leaders of society: Any commoner who attained the lowest military rank - grade 14 - or civil grade 8 was granted noble status, including the right to pass it to his children.</p><p>Peter's educational reforms, too, were <a href="/topic/utilitarian" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">utilitarian</a> in focus, as was his publishing program, which focused on such topics as shipbuilding, navigation, architecture, warfare, geography, and history. He introduced a new simplified alphabet, the so-called civil script, for printing secular works. The best-known and most successful of Peter's technical schools was the Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation (1701; from 1715, the St. Petersburg Naval Academy), which was run by British teachers. Its graduates were sent to teach in the socalled <a href="/topic/cipher" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">cipher</a> or arithmetic schools (1714), but these failed to attract pupils. Priests and church schools continued to be the main suppliers of primary education, and religious books continued to sell better than secular ones. The Academy of Sciences is generally regarded as the major achievement, although it did not open until 1726 and was initially staffed entirely by foreigners. In Russia, as elsewhere, children in rural communities, where child labor was vital to the economy, remained <a href="/topic/uneducated" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">uneducated</a>.</p><p class='shw'>The Church</p><p>The desire to deploy <a href="/topic/scarcity-1" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">scarce resources</a> as rationally as possible guided Peter's treatment of the Orthodox Church. He abolished the patriarchate, which was left vacant when the last Patriarch died in 1700, and in 1721 replaced it with the Holy Synod, which was based on the collegiate principle and later overseen by a secular official, the Over-Procurator. The Synod's <a href="/topic/rationale" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">rationale</a> and program were set out in the <i>Spiritual Regulation</i> (1721). Peter siphoned off church funds as required, but he stopped short of secularizing church lands. He slimmed down the <a href="/topic/priesthood" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">priesthood</a> by redeploying <a href="/topic/superfluous" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">superfluous</a> clergymen into state service and restricting entry into monasteries, which he regarded as refuges for shirkers. Remaining churchmen accumulated various civic duties, such as keeping registers of births and deaths, running schools and hospitals, and publicizing government decrees. These measures continued seventeenth-century trends in reducing the church's independent power, but Peter went farther by reducing its role in cultural life. Himself a dutiful Orthodox Christian who attended church regularly, he was happy for the Church to take responsibility for the saving of men's souls, but not for it to rule their lives. His reforms were supported by educated churchmen imported from Ukraine.</p><p class='shw'>St. Petersburg and the New Culture</p><p>The city of St. Petersburg began as an island fort at the mouth of the <a href="/topic/neva-river-geogrus-in-encyclopedia" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Neva river</a> on land captured from the Swedes in 1703. From about 1712 it came to be regarded as the capital. In Russia's battle for international recognition, St. Petersburg was much more than a useful naval base and port. It was a clean sheet on which Peter could construct a <a href="/topic/microcosm" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">microcosm</a> of his New Russia. The Western designs and decoration of palaces, government buildings, and churches, built in stone by hired foreign architects according to a rational plan, and the European fashions that all Russian townspeople were forced to wear, were calculated to make foreigners feel that they were in Europe rather than in Asia. The city became a "great window recently opened in the north through which Russia looks on Europe" (Francesco Algarotti, 1739). Peter often referred to it as his "paradise," playing on the associations with St. Peter as well as expressing his personal <a href="/topic/delight-in" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">delight in</a> a city built on water. The central public spaces enjoyed <a href="/topic/amenities-1" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">amenities</a> such as street lighting and paving and public welfare was supervised by the Chief of Police, although conditions were less <a href="/topic/salubrious" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">salubrious</a> in the backstreets. Nobles resented being uprooted from Moscow to this <a href="/topic/glorified" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">glorified</a> building site. Noblewomen were not <a href="/topic/exempt" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">exempt</a>. They were wrenched from their previously sheltered lives in the semi-secluded women's quarters or terem and ordered to abandon their modest, loose robes and veils in favor of Western low cut gowns and corsets and to socialize and drink with men. Some historians have referred to the "<a href="/topic/emancipation" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">emancipation</a>" of women under Peter, but it is doubtful whether this was the view of those involved.</p><p class='shw'>Peter's Vision and Methods</p><p>Peter was an absolute ruler, whose great height (six foot seven inches) and explosive temper must have intimidated those close to him. His portraits, the first thoroughly Westernized Russian images painted or sculpted from life, were embellished with Imperial Roman, allegorical, military, and naval motifs to <a href="/topic/underline" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">underline</a> his power. Yet he sought to <a href="/topic/deflect" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">deflect</a> his subjects' loyalty from himself to the state, exhorting them to work for the common good. A doer rather than a thinker, he lacked formal education and the <a href="/topic/patience" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">patience</a> for theorizing. Soviet historians favored the image of the Tsar-Carpenter, emphasizing the fourteen trades that Peter mastered, of which his favorites were shipbuilding and wood turning. He also occasionally practiced <a href="/topic/dentistry" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">dentistry</a> and surgery. Ironically, Peter often behaved in a manner that confirmed foreign prejudices that Russia was a <a href="/topic/barbaric" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">barbaric</a> country. Abroad he frequently <a href="/topic/offended-2" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">offended</a> his hosts with his <a href="/topic/appalling" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">appalling</a> manners, while Western visitors to Russia were <a href="/topic/perplexed" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">perplexed</a> by his court, which featured dwarfs, giants, and human "monsters" (from his Cabinet of Curiosities), compulsory drinking sessions, which armed guards prevented guests prevented from leaving, and weird ceremonies staged by the "All-Mad, All-Jesting, All-Drunken Assembly," which, headed by the Prince-Pope, parodied religious rituals. Throughout his life Peter maintained a mock court headed by a mock tsar known as Prince Caesar, who conferred promotions on "Peter Mikhailov" or "Peter Alexeyev," as Peter liked to be known as he worked his way through the ranks of the army and navy.</p><p>One of the functions of Peter's mock institutions was to <a href="/topic/ridicule" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">ridicule</a> the old ways. Peter constantly lamented his subjects' reluctance to improve themselves on their own initiative. As he wrote in an edict of 1721 to replace <a href="/topic/sickle" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">sickles</a> with more efficient scythes: "Even though something may be good, if it is new our people will not do it." He therefore resorted to force. In Russia, where <a href="/topic/serfdom" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">serfdom</a> was made law as recently as 1649, the idea of a servile population was not new, but under Peter servitude was extended and intensified. The army and navy <a href="/topic/swallow" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">swallowed</a> up tens of thousands of men. State peasants were increasingly requisitioned to work on major projects. Previously free persons were transferred to the status of serfs during the introduction of the poll tax. Peter also believed in the power of rules, regulations, and statutes, devised "in order that everyone knows his duties and no one excuses himself on the grounds of ignorance." In 1720, for example, he issued the General Regulation, a "regulation of regulations" for the new government apparatus. Not only the peasants, but also the nobles, found life <a href="/topic/burdensome" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">burdensome</a>. They were forced to serve for life and to educate their sons for service.</p><p class='shw'>Associates and Opponents</p><p>Despite his harsh methods, Peter was supported by a number of men, drawn from both the old Muscovite elite and from outside it. The most prominent of the newcomers were his favorite, the talented and corrupt Alexander Menshikov (1673 - 1729), whom he made a prince, and Paul Yaguzhinsky, who became the first Procurator-General. Top men from the traditional elite included General Boris Sheremetev, Chancellor Gavrila Golovkin, Admiral Fyodor Apraksin and Prince Fyodor Romodanovsky. The chief <a href="/topic/publicist" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">publicist</a> was the Ukrainian churchman Feofan Prokopovich.

The several revolts of his reign all included some elements of <a href="/topic/antagonism" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">antagonism</a> toward foreigners and foreign innovations such as <a href="/topic/shaving" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">shaving</a> and Western dress, along with more standard and <a href="/topic/substantive" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">substantive</a> complaints about the <a href="/topic/encroachment" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">encroachment</a> of central authority, high taxes, poor conditions of service, and <a href="/topic/remuneration" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">remuneration</a>. The most serious were the <a href="/topic/musketeer" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">musketeer</a> revolt of 1698, the <a href="/topic/astrakhan" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Astrakhan</a> revolt of 1705, and the rebellion led by the Don Cossack Ivan Bulavin in 1707 - 1708. The disruption that worried Peter most, however, affected his inner circle. Peter was married twice: in 1689 to the noblewoman Yevdokia Lopukhina, whom he banished to a convent in 1699, and in 1712 to Catherine, a former servant girl from Livonia whom he met around 1703. He groomed the surviving son of his first marriage, <a href="/topic/alexei-petrovich" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Alexei Petrovich</a> (1690 - 1718), as his successor, but they had a troubled relationship. In 1716 Alexei fled abroad. Lured back to Russia in 1718, he was tried and condemned to death for treason, based on <a href="/topic/unfounded" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">unfounded</a> charges of a plot to assassinate his father. Many of Alexei's associates were executed, and people in leading circles were suspected of sympathy for him. Peter and Catherine had at least ten children (the precise number is unknown), but only two girls reached maturity: Anna and Elizabeth (who reigned as empress from 1741 to 1761). In 1722 Peter issued a new Law of Succession by which the reigning monarch nominated his own successor, but he failed to record his choice before his death (from a <a href="/topic/bladder-infection" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">bladder infection</a>) in February (January O.S.) 1725. Immediately after Peter's death, Menshikov and some leading courtiers with guards' support backed Peter's widow, who reigned as Catherine I (1725 - 1727).</p><p class='shw'>Views of Peter and His Reforms</p><p>The official view in the eighteenth century and much of the nineteenth was that Peter had "given birth" to Russia, transforming it from "nonexistence" into "being." Poets represented him as Godlike. The man and his methods were easily accommodated in later eighteenth-century discourses of Enlightened Absolutism. Even during Peter's lifetime, however, questions were raised about the heavy cost of his schemes and the dangers of abandoning native culture and institutions. As the Russian historian Nikolai Karamzin commented in 1810: "Truly, St. Petersburg is founded on tears and corpses." He believed that Peter had made Russians citizens of the world, but prevented them from being Russians. Hatred of St. Petersburg as a symbol of alien traditions was an important element in the attitude of nineteenth-century <a href="/topic/slavophile" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Slavophiles</a>, who believed that only the peasants had retained Russian cultural values. To their Westernizer opponents, however, Peter's reforms, stopping short of Western freedoms, had not gone far enough. In the later nineteenth century, serious studies of seventeenth-century <a href="/topic/muscovy" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Muscovy</a> questioned the revolutionary nature of Peter's reign, underlining that many of Peter's reforms and policies, such as hiring foreigners, reforming the army, and borrowing Western culture, originated with his predecessors. The last tsars, especially Nicholas II, took a <a href="/topic/nostalgia" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">nostalgic</a> view of pre-Petrine Russia, but Petrine values were revered by the imperial court until its demise.</p><p>Soviet historians generally took a <a href="/topic/bipolar" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">bipolar</a> view of Peter's reign. On the one hand, they believed that Russia had to catch up with the West, whatever the cost; hence they regarded institutional and cultural reforms, the new army, navy, factories, and so on as "progressive." Territorial expansion was approved. On the other hand, Soviet historians were bound to denounce Peter's exploitation of the peasantry and to praise popular rebels such as Bulavin; moreover, under Stalin, Peter's cosmopolitanism was treated with suspicion. Cultural historians in particular stressed native achievements over foreign borrowings. In the 1980s - 1990s some began to take a more negative view still, characterizing Peter as "the creator of the administrative-command system and the true ancestor of Stalin" (Anisimov, 1993). After the collapse of the USSR, the <a href="/topic/secession" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">secession</a> of parts of the former Empire and Union, and the decline of the armed forces and navy, many people looked back to Peter's reign as a time when Russia was strong and to Peter as an ideal example of a strong leader.

	<span class="hw">Peter I</span> or <span class="shw">Peter the Great,</span> 1672-1725, czar of Russia (1682-1725), major figure in the development of imperial Russia.<p><span class="shw">Early Life</span></p><p>Peter was the youngest child of Czar Alexis, by Alexis's second wife, Natalya Naryshkin. From Alexis's first marriage (with Maria Miloslavsky) were born Feodor III, Sophia Alekseyevna, and the semi-imbecile Ivan. On Feodor III's death (1682), a struggle broke out for the succession between the Naryshkin and Miloslavsky factions. The Naryshkins at first succeeded in setting Ivan aside in favor of 10-year-old Peter. Shortly afterward, however, the Miloslavsky party incited the <i>streltsi</i> (semimilitary formations in Moscow) to rebellion. In the bloody disorder that followed, Peter witnessed the murders of many of his supporters. As a result of the rebellion Ivan, as <a href="/topic/ivan-v-of-russia" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Ivan V</a>, was made (1682) joint czar with Peter, under the regency of <a href="/topic/sophia-alekseyevna-russian-stateswoman" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Sophia Alekseyevna</a>.</p><p>A virtual exile, Peter spent most of his childhood in a suburb of Moscow, surrounded by playmates drawn both from the nobility and from the roughest social elements. His talent for leadership soon became apparent when he organized military games that became regular maneuvers in siegecraft. In addition, Peter began to experiment with shipbuilding on Lake Pereyaslavl (now Lake Pleshcheyevo). Peter learned the rudiments of Western military science from the European soldiers and adventurers who lived in a foreign settlement near Moscow. His most influential foreign friends, Patrick <a href="/topic/patrick-gordon" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Gordon</a> of Scotland, François <a href="/topic/lefort-fran-ois" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Lefort</a> of Geneva, and Franz Timmermann of Holland, came from this colony. In 1689, Sophia Alekseyevna attempted a coup against Peter; this time, however, aided by the loyal part of the <i>streltsi,</i> he overthrew the regent. For several years, until Peter assumed personal rule, the Naryshkins ran the government. Ivan V, whose death in 1696 left Peter sole czar, took no part in the government.</p><p><span class="shw">Sole Ruler</span></p><p><b>Foreign Policy</b></p><p>Russia was almost continuously at war during Peter's reign. In the 16th and early 17th cent. the country had fought periodically in the northwest against Sweden, in an attempt to gain access to the Baltic Sea, and in the south against the Ottoman Empire. While continuing the policy of his predecessors, Peter drew Russia into European affairs and helped to make it a great power. His earliest venture was the conquest of Azov from the Ottomans in 1696, after an unsuccessful attempt in 1695. Peter then embarked on a European tour (1697-98), traveling partly incognito, to form a grand alliance against the Ottoman Empire and to acquire the Western techniques necessary to modernize Russia's armed forces. He failed to form an anti-Ottoman alliance, but his conversations with the Polish king and others led eventually (1699) to a coalition against Sweden.</p><p>Peter also gained considerable knowledge of European industrial techniques (he even spent some time working as a ship's carpenter in Holland) and hired many European artisans for service in Russia. In 1698 he returned to Russia, began to modernize the armed forces, and launched domestic reforms. After concluding (1700) peace with the Ottomans, Peter, in alliance with Denmark and the combined Saxony-Poland, began the <a href="/topic/northern-wars" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Northern War</a> (1700-1721) against <a href="/topic/charles-xii" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Charles XII</a> of Sweden. Although disastrously defeated at first, he routed Charles at Poltava in 1709 and by the Treaty of Nystad (1721) retained his conquests of Ingermanland, Karelia, and Livonia.</p><p>Peter's conquests in the south were less permanent. Azov was restored to the Ottoman Empire in 1711; Derbent, Baku, and the southern coast of the Caspian Sea, conquered in a war (1722-23) with Persia, were soon lost again. In the east, Russia extended its control over part of Siberia but failed to subjugate either Khiva or Bokhara. Peter's first diplomatic missions to China were unsuccessful but his efforts led to the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), which fixed the Russo-Chinese border and established commercial relations. Peter's interest in imperial expansion led to the financing of the first voyage of Vitus <a href="/topic/vitus-bering" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Bering</a>.</p><p><b>Domestic Policy</b></p><p>Peter had returned to Russia in 1698 at the news of a military revolt allegedly instigated by Sophia Alekseyevna. He took drastic vengeance on his opponents and forced Sophia into a convent. On the day after his return, Peter personally cut off the beards of his nobles and shortly thereafter ordered them to replace their long robes and conical hats with Western dress. This attack on the symbols of old Muscovy marked the beginning of Peter's attempt to force Russia to adopt European appearance and other features of Western culture. Most of Peter's reforms followed his predecessors' tentative steps, but his demonic pace and brutal methods created an impression of revolutionary change.</p><p>The reforms were sporadic and uncoordinated; many of them grew out of the needs of Peter's almost continuous warfare. He introduced conscription on a territorial basis, enlarged and modernized the army, founded and expanded the navy, and established technical schools to train men for military service. To finance this huge military establishment, he created state monopolies, introduced the first poll tax, and placed levies on every conceivable item. Peter encouraged and subsidized private industry and established state mines and factories to provide adequate supplies of war materials. Peter reformed the administrative machinery of the state. He introduced a supervisory senate and a new system of central administration and tried to reform provincial and local government.</p><p>Peter also attempted to subordinate all classes of Russian society to the needs of the state. He enlarged the service nobility (the body of nobles who owed service to the state), imposed further duties on it, and forced the sons of nobles to attend technical schools. To control the nobles he introduced the Table of Ranks, which established a bureaucratic hierarchy in which promotion was based on merit rather than on birth. The nobility's economic position was strengthened by changes in the laws of land tenure. The serfs (who paid the bulk of taxes and made up most of the soldiery) were bound more securely to their masters and to the land. Peter subordinated the church to the state by replacing the patriarchate with a holy synod, headed by a lay procurator appointed by the czar.</p><p>Peter introduced changes in manners and mores. The ban on beards and Muscovite dress was extended to the entire male population, women were released from their servile position, and attempts were made to improve the manners of the court and administration. Peter sent many Russians to be schooled in the West and was responsible for the foundation (1725) of the Academy of Sciences. He reformed the calendar and simplified the alphabet. The transfer of the capital from Moscow to <a href="/topic/saint-petersburg" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">St. Petersburg</a>, built on the swamps of Ingermanland at tremendous human cost, was a dramatic symbol of Peter's reforms. Although Peter sought to enforce all his reforms with equal severity, he was unable to eradicate the traditional corruption of officials or to impose Western ways on the peasantry.</p><p>His reforms were often considered whimsical and sacrilegious and met widespread opposition. The conservatives among the clergy accused him of being the antichrist. The discontented looked to Peter's son, <a href="/topic/alexei-mikhailovich" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Alexis</a>, who was eventually tried for treason on flimsy evidence and was tortured to death (1718). In 1721, Peter had himself proclaimed "emperor of all Russia." In 1722 he declared the choice of a successor to be dependent on the sovereign's will; this decree (valid until the reign of Paul I) preceded the coronation (1724) of his second wife as Empress Catherine I. She was a Livonian peasant girl whom Peter had made his mistress, then his wife (1712) after repudiating his first consort. Her accession on Peter's death was largely engineered by Peter's chief lieutenant and favorite, A. D. <a href="/topic/aleksandr-danilovich-menshikov" class="ilnk" target="_top" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Menshikov</a>. Although many of Peter's innovations were too hasty and arbitrary to be successful, his reign was decisive in the long process of transforming medieval Muscovy into modern Russia.</p><p><span class="shw">Personality and Achievements</span></p><p>Peter's personal traits ranged from bestial cruelty and vice to the most selfless devotion to Russia; his order to his troops at Poltava read, "Remember that you are fighting not for Peter but for the state." Despite the convulsive fits that plagued him, he had a bearlike constitution, was of gigantic stature, and possessed herculean physical prowess. He drank himself into stupors and indulged in all conceivable vices but could rouse himself at a moment's notice, and he was willing to undergo all the physical exertions and privations that he exacted from his subjects.</p><p>Peter subordinated the lives and liberties of his subjects to his own conception of the welfare of the state. Like many of his successors, he concluded that ruthless reform was necessary to overcome Russia's backwardness. Peter remains one of the most controversial figures in Russian history. Those who regard Russia as essentially European praise him for his policy of Westernization, and others who consider Russia a unique civilization attack him for turning Russia from its special path of development. Those impressed by imperial expansion and state and social reforms tend to regard Peter's arbitrary and brutal methods as necessary, while others appalled by his disregard of human life conclude that the cost outweighed any gains.</p><p><span class="shw">Bibliography</span></p><p>The first biographer of Peter the Great was Voltaire.

Peter I, who was formally known as Peter the Great after defeating Sweden in the Great Northern War in 1721, has long defined the transition from old to modern Russia in Russian historical consciousness.

After opening a shipyard on the lower <a href="/topic/volga-river" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Volga River</a>, in <a href="/topic/voronezh" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Voronezh</a>, he departed on his vaunted Great Embassy, an extended journey through Europe, traveling nominally <a href="/topic/incognito" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">incognito</a> as a captain ("Peter Mikhailov") largely to avoid ceremonial obligations at foreign courts. He spent most of 1697–1698 abroad, in Holland, England, the Germanies, and France, observing trades and hiring hundreds of craftsmen and naval officers to work in Russia building and training a fleet. Upon his return he inaugurated a <a href="/topic/flurry" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">flurry</a> of changes, mostly designed to build a formidable navy and maximize the number of men in arms. These included establishing a Navigational (later Naval) Academy and initiating a military draft to replace the <a href="/topic/outmoded" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">outmoded</a> mobilization of peasant militias. Beginning in 1705 one adult male in <a href="/topic/seventy" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">seventy</a> was to be drafted, and, during the course of the Northern War, the ratio fell as low as one in twenty. Those drafted served for life, and their legal status became that of soldier. While the number of those in arms was not dramatically greater than before, perhaps a quarter million at its peak, these soldiers, organized into permanent regiments and detachments, were far better trained and equipped than their forebears.</p><p>The dual war against Sweden and the Ottoman Empire (and, at the end of the reign, against Persia) constituted an immense drain on resources and cost tens of thousands of lives. After succumbing to Sweden's superior forces at <a href="/topic/narva" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Narva</a>, in contemporary Estonia, in 1700, Peter's forces slowly gained an upper hand, most spectacularly in the south at Poltava in 1709. A significant <a href="/topic/setback" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">setback</a> in 1711 at Pruth, north of the Caspian Sea, nearly cost Peter his life and much of his army, but they recovered, and by 1714 the tide of war had turned decisively in Russia's favor. The final victory and Treaty of 1721 secured Russia's place in Europe's northern waters, and it began Russia's extended push to the south, a process not completed until the 1780s.</p><p class='shw' style='font-size:15px; font-weight:bolder'>Personal and Court Life</p><p>Biographies of Peter emphasize his untraditional <a href="/topic/upbringing" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">upbringing</a> in the suburban Muscovite village of Preobrazhensky. Removed from the confines of the Moscow Kremlin, he spent much of his boyhood playing at war, in the company of commoners and foreigners rather than with churchmen and the scions of <a href="/topic/aristocratic-1" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">aristocratic</a> families, as had been the norm. Peter's height (over six-and-a-half feet tall) and energy, his unquenchable <a href="/topic/curiosity" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">curiosity</a>, in particular for practical technologies, and his bawdiness and <a href="/topic/impatience" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">impatience</a> with the formalities of tradition also are invariably seen as embodying his differences from those who preceded him to the throne. This tendency toward earthiness manifested itself in drunken and <a href="/topic/debauched-2" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">debauched</a> revelry with his confreres at court, Peter's so-called fledglings, but the Petrine "culture of <a href="/topic/laughter" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">laughter</a>" had a political and ritualized side beyond the mere exercise of <a href="/topic/merriment" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">merriment</a>. Peter created mock institutions, such as His Majesty's Most-Drunken Synod, as an <a href="/topic/antidote" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">antidote</a> to the solemnities of the church hierarchy—to which he nevertheless regularly had to submit—as if to emphasize the tsar's independence of them and his devotion to this-worldly endeavors. He created the mock title of "Prince Pope," a <a href="/topic/playful" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">playful</a> alter ego sometimes termed the Russian John Barleycorn.</p><p class='shw' style='font-size:15px; font-weight:bolder'>Cultural and Religious Reform</p><p>Peter's cultural revolution often took on a <a href="/topic/decidedly" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">decidedly</a> coercive cast. Symbolic of his statist and modernizing vision was the establishment of a new capital, St. Petersburg, situated in the swampy territory of Ingermanland, on the site of a small fortress on the southeastern rim of the Gulf of Finland. First proclaimed in 1704, the capital's initial permanent structures were completed in 1707, when the government began to shift from Moscow. Situated far from the center of Russian population, with a German name, a decidedly un-Russian <a href="/topic/rectilinear" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">rectilinear</a> street pattern, and distinctly European architecture, the new capital stood as a powerful statement of the massive Europeanization to which Peter meant to subject his realm.</p><p>Taxes on beards and sleeves, first imposed in 1699–1700, obliged serving men to break with Muscovite appearances and adopt European dress. The balls at court, culminating in the 1718 decree on "assemblies," imposed a new Europeanized public <a href="/topic/sociability" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">sociability</a> at court, one that commanded the visible presence of women as well as men at balls, formal dinners, and celebrations. The switch in 1700 to the Julian calendar (previously the new year had occurred on September 1), and counting the years from the birth of Christ rather than from creation, commanded nothing less than a<i> renovatio</i> of time. The imposition of a new "civil" alphabet in 1707, which over time became the <a href="/topic/orthography" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">orthography</a> of <a href="/topic/officialdom" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">officialdom</a> and secularity, reinforced in highly visible ways the symbolic separation of the church's spiritual realm (Church Slavonic and the religious calendar) from the state's civic realm.</p><p>Peter's determination to separate the church from and subordinate it to the state defined his entire approach to ecclesiastical authority, culminating in the elimination of the patriarchate in 1721 and its replacement by a governmental body, the Holy Synod. Peter's relationships to church and religion were more complex than mere <a href="/topic/caesaropapism" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">caesaropapism</a>, however. Sincerely if eccentrically religious, he held <a href="/topic/redemption" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">redemption</a> and salvation paramount, and he relied on clergy to help him rule and reign. Leading ecclesiastic officials, such as Feofan Prokopovich and Gavriil Buzhinskii (the first rector of the <a href="/topic/alexander-nevsky" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Alexander Nevski</a> monastery), articulated the ideological legitimation for Peter's reforms and produced the defining panegyrics of his reign and legacy. Parish clergy were required (at least by the terms of the Spiritual Regulation of 1721) to act as agencies of the law as well as of the soul, by reading <a href="/topic/aloud" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">aloud</a> new decrees and keeping parish registries and confession lists. The large monastic clergy, whom Peter viewed as little more than <a href="/topic/parasite" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">parasites</a>, experienced reform personally as Peter closed approximately two-thirds of Russia's monasteries and submitted the rest to a test of their social utility.</p><p class='shw' style='font-size:15px; font-weight:bolder'>Social and Administrative Policies</p><p>It would be a mistake to imagine that Peter's reforms followed an <a href="/topic/orderly" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">orderly</a> or systematic path. Nevertheless, a functionalist <a href="/topic/schema" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">schema</a> suggested by the early-twentieth-century historian Paul Miliukov effectively captures the dynamics of policy reform. Military necessity drove technological and military reform, whose immense costs (commanding up to 90 percent of the budget) necessitated changes in taxation and in mass mobilization. Thus, Peter imposed numerous tariffs and luxury taxes before transforming direct taxation in 1724 from a household basis to a per capita "soul tax" of 74 kopecks, which counted adult males (with certain exemptions). He eliminated slavery, making all former slaves into serfs, who were thus subject to the soul tax and military recruitment. Changes such as these demanded comparable reforms in central and provincial administration, the conducting of regular censuses, and the overhaul of state service.</p><p>Peter's interventions in the landed nobility were particularly momentous. Having done away with the last of the landed militias, and freed from the old system of precedence<i> (Mestnichestvo),</i> Peter pursued <a href="/topic/ad-hoc" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">ad hoc</a> strategies to make service more professional. As before, service remained compulsory, but it was deemed a full-time, lifelong obligation, slowly transforming noble serving men into <a href="/topic/absentee" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">absentee</a> landlords. Seeking to <a href="/topic/loosen" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">loosen</a> the <a href="/topic/stranglehold" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">stranglehold</a> of elite noble clans, Peter collapsed all forms of land tenure into hereditary land, and he elevated several foreigners and lowborn Russians to positions of authority, nominally on the basis of ability. This latter practice was <a href="/topic/institutionalize" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">institutionalized</a> in 1722 with the Table of Ranks and Orders, which pegged specific work to specific ranks, salaries, and privileges. In addition to eliminating virtually all of the Muscovite terms of status, such as "<a href="/topic/boyar" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">boyar</a>" and "boyar's son," the Table of Ranks created a mechanism of advancement, at least on paper, whereby <a href="/topic/untitled" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">untitled</a> servitors could advance first to personal nobility and then to hereditary nobility. Peter also intervened directly in familial inheritance by abolishing partible inheritance in 1714 in favor of unigeniture, wherein one son would inherit the entire estate. Deeply resented by noble families, unigeniture was dropped in 1731 and partible inheritance returned.</p><p>To maintain administration during his frequent absences, he created the Ruling Senate in 1711, which had the power of decree in the tsar's name. Originally composed of his closest advisers, the Senate took on a more <a href="/topic/bureaucrat" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">bureaucratic</a> cast toward the end of his reign, when Peter replaced the Muscovite system of ad hoc civil chancelleries with twelve functionally defined colleges, each of which was to be run by a council rather than by a single individual as in a ministerial system. Each college was represented in the revised Senate. Provincial government underwent a somewhat more modest reorganization in 1708 with the creation of eight vast territorial governments. These territorial governments had almost no direct contact with the populations over which they nominally ruled. As before, the exercise of governmental authority in the provinces relied mostly on a mixture of military presence and <a href="/topic/unpaid" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">unpaid</a> office holding. Exceptions to this rule were tax collecting and military recruitment, placed in the hands of a <a href="/topic/cadre" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">cadre</a> of armed horsemen called fiscals, a group whose name became synonymous with violence and <a href="/topic/brute" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">brute</a> confiscation.</p><p>The disruptions generated by these widely unpopular policies engendered extensive popular <a href="/topic/resentment" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">resentment</a> and periodic waves of armed resistance and defections from his ranks. These included rebellions by Moscow's musketeers<i> (strel'tsy)</i> in 1697, Cossack-led rebellions (Bulavin's revolt in 1707 and Mazepa's defection to the Swedes in 1708), and Old Believer riots (1703–1704 and later). Numerous elements of Russia's population looked upon the era as one of <a href="/topic/oppression" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">oppression</a> and betrayal and upon the tsar as a <a href="/topic/tyrant" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">tyrant</a>, usurper, and <a href="/topic/antichrist" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">Antichrist</a>. All such opposition met fierce <a href="/topic/repression" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">repression</a>; none elicited moderation or concessions.</p><p class='shw' style='font-size:15px; font-weight:bolder'>Succession</p><p>A combination of familial rivalry (the disinheritance of his eldest son, Alexis, and his death in prison before his planned execution in 1718) and <a href="/topic/misfortune" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">misfortune</a> (the death of his youngest son, Peter, in 1716) deprived Peter of direct male heirs. In response, Peter decreed a new form of succession in 1722 in which the reigning monarch named the successor. This shortsighted decision virtually guaranteed periodic <a href="/topic/instability" class="alnk" target="_top" onclick="track('ALINK');assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));">instability</a> at court, especially when a ruler died without naming a successor, as was the case with Peter himself. Unintentionally, however, it opened the way for nearly a century of female rule by displacing the principle of father-son lineage. Peter's widow, Catherine, thus became Russia's first crowned female ruler in 1725.</p><p class='shw' style='font-size:15px; font-weight:bolder'>Bibliography</p><p class='shw'><i>Primary Sources</i></p><p>Pososhkhóv, Iván.<i> The Book of Poverty and Wealth.</i> Translated by L.
