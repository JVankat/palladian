<div><em><span class="storySubHead">After decades of misunderstanding him, <br />
I came to see Paul&rsquo;s tender side.</span></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="storyAuthor">By Reinder Bruinsma</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="cap">A</span>sked what he thought the &#8232;&nbsp;apostle Paul may have &#8232;<span>looked like, Martin Luther reportedly suggested he may have resembled Luther&rsquo;s colleague Philip Melanchthon.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;From historical portraits, we know that Melanchthon was a rather scrawny-looking individual, with facial expressions that&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;did not express much joy in life. And, somehow, I&rsquo;ve also thought of Paul in much the same way. Whereas I had a mental picture of Peter as a rather buoyant individual, whom I might want to invite for a hot drink and an interesting chat, I have imagined Paul as a stern academic who preferred wrestling with difficult theological questions rather than having a good meal with a friend. He did not seem a very social person to me; not a man who would reach out to hug people, take time for small talk, or establish strong ties of friendship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The final chapter of Romans changed my mind.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="storySubHead">A people person</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="blurbRight"><img height="33" width="250" src="site/1/template/intext-top.jpg" alt="" /><br />
When we look at Paul from the perspective of Romans 16, a new picture emerges.<br />
<img height="33" width="250" src="site/1/template/intext-bottom.jpg" alt="" /></span>When Paul wrote Romans from Corinth, around A.D. 55, he had not yet visited Rome. His letter to the church in Rome, a church worshipping at that time in the homes of members, turned out to be his most prominent letter, spelling out in more detail than in any of his other letters his theology of redemption in Christ. But in this article I focus on the epilogue of the epistle&mdash;on the list of greetings we find in chapter 16.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Phoebe, whom Paul mentions at the beginning of the chapter, probably was the one who carried the letter to Rome. She was a prominent female member of the church in Cenchrea, near Corinth. The Greek text seems to indicate that she was a deaconess. The letter she carried contained greetings to no fewer than 29 individuals in Rome.<br />
&nbsp;</div>
Priscilla and Aquila, Paul&rsquo;s former colleagues in tent making, are mentioned first (verse 3). The couple had fled Rome during the persecutions by Emperor Claudius (Acts 18:2). Paul met them in Corinth and Ephesus, and here refers to them as &ldquo;fellow workers in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Paul then greets Epenetus (verse 5), the first convert to Christ in what is now Turkey. Next he mentions Mary, one of many biblical characters with that name. She &ldquo;worked very hard&rdquo; for the church, he says (verse 6). (Let&rsquo;s remember to look for her in the New Jerusalem and find out who she was.)
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I cannot comment on all 29 names. But Andronicus and Junias (verse 7) deserve brief mention. They were &ldquo;outstanding among the apostles,&rdquo; Paul says. This is a remarkable statement, given that there&rsquo;s a considerable chance that Junias was a woman. The name &ldquo;Junias&rdquo; can be either male or female, and for more than 1,000 years, commentaries from theologians referred to this person as female. The fourth-century writer John Chrysostom even expressed his amazement about the fact that there apparently was a woman among the apostles. (However, from the thirteenth century onward it became customary to understand Junias as a masculine name.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Skipping over Ampliatus, Urbanus, Stachys, and Apelles (since all we have are their names), we come to Aristobulus (verse 10). He may have been a grandson of King Herod. Herodion (verse 11) may also have belonged to the Herod family. Narcissus, too (verse 11), may have been a member of high society&mdash;some suggesting he may have been a private secretary at the imperial court.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Further down the list we find the name Rufus (verse 13). His name brings to mind Mark 15:21, where a certain Simon of Cyrene (who carried Jesus&rsquo; cross) is described as &ldquo;the father of Alexander and Rufus.&rdquo; Some Bible scholars believe that Mark&rsquo;s Gospel initially may have been written for Christians in Rome. And perhaps knowing that Rufus eventually ended up in Rome, Mark made the gesture of inserting that detail in his Gospel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img height="267" width="200" align="right" src="site/1/2008-1010/2008-1010-page12-intext1.jpg" alt="" />After the mention of a few additional names, Paul concludes his letter, encouraging his recipients to greet one another with &ldquo;a holy kiss&rdquo; (verse 16), a custom he admonished his readers to follow in other places in his Epistles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="storySubHead">A Different Paul</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Paul had never yet been to Rome; yet he knew nearly 30 persons there by name! And it&rsquo;s remarkable that nine of the 29 persons mentioned are women. Could it be that Paul was not the kind of antiwoman person he is often made out to be? Also, while some in the list were people of considerable status&mdash;in Roman society as well as in the church, Paul also remembered the names of others&mdash;&ldquo;simple,&rdquo; hardworking, dependable people&mdash;who had no notable pedigree or academic background.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When we look at Paul from the perspective of Romans 16, a new picture emerges&mdash;of someone who was intensely interested in people. And as we keep this aspect in mind while rereading the rest of Romans and the other Epistles, we see clear confirmation of this picture in many places. In between, and behind, the theology and the often stern criticism and admonitions, we see <em>a man who loved people and who genuinely cared for them. </em>Where is this more clearly visible than in his letters to Timothy, whom he loves as if he were his own son (2 Tim. 1:1-5)? And his passion for his own nation comes through clearly in Romans 9:2-4: &ldquo;I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, the people of Israel.&rdquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="storySubHead">The Human Face</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a church administrator, I would spend a great deal of my time in meetings, discussing all kinds of organizational and business items&mdash;policies, programs, buildings, money, positions to fill, reports to be evaluated. And that was all part of the job&mdash;a major part. But ultimately I would have failed if I did not see the human face behind the issues, if I did not value people above policies. If what I and other church leaders do has no human face, it had better be left undone.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If we want to work for the church at whatever level, in paid employment or as a volunteer, we must love people. It is significant that the letter to the Romans does not culminate in high-sounding doctrinal statements or theology, but rather with people&mdash;people with names and faces. And so today, whether we&rsquo;re discussing theology, doctrines, difficult moral and social issues, developing policies, or whatever else, all perspectives change when we allow those issues to take on a human face.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Romans 16 has transformed my thinking about Paul. He has become more human to me. He knew 29 people in a church he&rsquo;d never been to! How well do we know the people all around us in the church?</div>
