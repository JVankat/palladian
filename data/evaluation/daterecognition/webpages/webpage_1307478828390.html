                                <p><i>The Convergence of Crime and Terror: Law 
                                  Enforcement Opportunities and Perils </i>provides 
                                  an analysis of the increasingly important link 
                                  between traditional criminal activities and 
                                  terrorism. By cataloging a number of relevant 
                                  cases, the authors have illustrated that terrorists 
                                  routinely resort to &#147;traditional&#148; 
                                  crimes, from drug trafficking to financial scams, 
                                  to further their objectives.</p>
                                <p>As a result, terror prosecutions must find 
                                  inspiration from historical government efforts 
                                  to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate notorious 
                                  violent criminals such as Al Capone on relatively 
                                  minor charges such as tax evasion. The aggressive 
                                  prosecution of such relatively minor offenses 
                                  can serve to disrupt grander malevolent schemes.</p>
                                <p>As the authors suggest, the rise of terrorism 
                                  means that the traditional, reactive law enforcement 
                                  model must change. We cannot afford to wait 
                                  until after a successful terrorist attack occurs 
                                  to investigate and prosecute. The examples from 
                                  Europe included in this paper provide a sobering 
                                  explanation for why that is so. Law enforcement 
                                  officials must consider disruptive investigations 
                                  and prosecutions that may not ultimately lead 
                                  to a criminal trial on terrorism charges but 
                                  that will stop potential terror plots before 
                                  they are put into motion. </p>
                                <p>We face a decentralized, networked, and self-sufficient 
                                  enemy. Independent cells are increasingly purchasing 
                                  that self-sufficiency with the proceeds of criminal 
                                  enterprises. This hard reality provides yet 
                                  another justification for transforming state 
                                  and local first responders into first preventers 
                                  of crime and terror.</p>

                                <p><b>Daveed Gartenstein-Ross</b> is a senior 
                                  fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies 
                                  and director of its Project on Religion, Politics, 
                                  and Radicalism. Gartenstein-Ross also consults 
                                  for a number of clients on issues of terrorism 
                                  and Islamic extremism, including the Manhattan 
                                  Institute&#146;s Center for Policing Terrorism, 
                                  the Christian Broadcasting Network, and law 
                                  enforcement.</p>
                                <p>Born into a Jewish family, Gartenstein-Ross 
                                  converted to Islam in his early twenties and 
                                  worked for the head U.S. office of the Al Haramain 
                                  Islamic Foundation, an international Wahhabi 
                                  charity that was a major al-Qaeda financier. 
                                  Prior to 9/11, Gartenstein-Ross left the Islamic 
                                  faith for Christianity. By the time the FBI 
                                  raided the Al Haramain offices where he had 
                                  worked, he was ready to assist the investigation. 
                                  This experience is detailed in his book <i>My 
                                  Year Inside Radical Islam</i>.</p>
                                <p>Gartenstein-Ross has testified before the U.S.

                                  in prisons. He frequently writes on the global

                                <p>The Soviet Union was a major terrorist sponsor 
                                  during the Cold War. When the USSR collapsed, 
                                  terrorist groups were forced to look elsewhere 
                                  financially, and many turned to criminal activities. 
                                  Some fifteen years later, terrorist groups that 
                                  are not state-sponsored pose the greatest threat 
                                  to the United States.[<a href="#notes">1</a>] 
                                  Consistent with post&#150;Cold War trends, these 
                                  groups have become heavily involved in criminal 
                                  activities. (While this paper discusses a number 
                                  of federal criminal statutes, state criminal 
                                  laws also are applicable; we use federal law 
                                  as a vehicle for discourse as a matter of convenience.)</p>
                                <p>Terrorist involvement in criminal activity 
                                  has two strategically significant aspects. First, 
                                  it allows terrorists to gain financially while 
                                  at the same time damaging the societies they 
                                  target. Terrorists, always on the lookout for 
                                  new ways to fund their violent activities, find 
                                  important sources of revenue in criminal enterprises. 
                                  Close scrutiny of jihadist terrorism since 9/11 
                                  demonstrates that these groups are often funded 
                                  through the drug trade, money-laundering schemes, 
                                  and a variety of financial scams that range 
                                  from the simple to the highly complex. Terrorists 
                                  also use other illegal activities, such as document 
                                  fraud and sham marriages, to facilitate their 
                                  operational objectives.</p>
                                <p>A second strategic aspect is that law enforcement 
                                  can derive some advantage from the crime-terrorism 
                                  nexus. A comprehensive law enforcement model 
                                  for counterterrorism has echoes of the approach 
                                  used to fight the mob in the early to mid-twentieth 
                                  century. This approach was typified by the prosecution 
                                  of Al Capone, who in 1931 was the country&#146;s 
                                  first celebrity criminal.[<a href="#notes">2</a>] 
                                  Everybody knew what Capone was up to: his litany 
                                  of offenses included murder, bribery, and running 
                                  illegal breweries. But the government would 
                                  have had trouble proving Capone&#146;s guilt 
                                  beyond a reasonable doubt for his most notorious 
                                  activities. Instead, he was charged with tax 
                                  evasion, prompting the incredulous mobster to 
                                  say, &#147;The government can&#146;t collect 
                                  legal taxes from illegal money.&#148;[<a href="#notes">3</a>] 
                                  Capone proved to be wrong, and he entered an 
                                  Atlanta prison on May 5, 1932.</p>
                                <p>Shortly after 9/11, then&#150;attorney general 
                                  John Ashcroft recommended that a similar disruptive 
                                  approach be used against suspected terrorists:</p>
                                <blockquote><p>Attorney General [Robert] Kennedy made no apologies 
                                  for using all of the available resources in 
                                  the law to disrupt and dismantle organized crime 
                                  networks. Very often, prosecutors were aggressive, 
                                  using obscure statutes to arrest and detain 
                                  suspected mobsters. One racketeer and his father 
                                  were indicted for lying on a federal home loan 
                                  application. A former gunman for the Capone 
                                  mob was brought to court on a violation of the 
                                  Migratory Bird Act. Agents found 563 game birds 
                                  in his freezer&#151;a mere 539 birds over the 
                                  limit...</p>
                                <p>The American people face a serious, immediate 
                                  and ongoing threat from terrorism. At this moment, 
                                  American service men and women are risking their 
                                  lives to battle the enemy overseas. It falls 
                                  to the men and women of justice and law enforcement 
                                  to engage terrorism at home. History&#146;s 
                                  judgment will be harsh&#151;and the people&#146;s 
                                  judgment will be sure&#151;if we fail to use 
                                  every available resource to prevent future terrorist 
                                  attacks.</p>
                                <p>Robert Kennedy&#146;s Justice Department, it 
                                  is said, would arrest mobsters for &#147;spitting 
                                  on the sidewalk&#148; if it would help in the 
                                  battle against organized crime. It has been 
                                  and will be the policy of this Department of 
                                  Justice to use the same aggressive arrest and 
                                  detention tactics in the war on terror.<br>
                                    Let the terrorists among us be warned: If 
                                    you overstay your visa&#151;even by one day&#151;we 
                                    will arrest you. If you violate a local law, 
                                    you will be put in jail and kept in custody 
                                    as long as possible. We will use every available 
                                    statute. We will seek every prosecutorial 
                                    advantage. We will use all our weapons within 
                                    the law and under the Constitution to protect

                                <p>The Al Capone/mob model for combating suspected 
                                  terrorists is not without its critics,[<a href="#notes">5</a>] 
                                  but it is a sensible response to the threat 
                                  that the country faces. Terrorists have killed 
                                  more innocent Americans than the mob ever did,[<a href="#notes">6</a>] 
                                  and if the next terrorist attack employs weapons 
                                  of mass destruction, it could be even more devastating 
                                  than 9/11.[<a href="#notes">7</a>]</p>
                                <p>As with the mob, prosecutors often have difficulty 
                                  proving involvement in terrorist acts beyond 
                                  a reasonable doubt. But also as with the mob, 
                                  as the government investigates an individual 
                                  who is strongly suspected of terrorist ties, 
                                  it often uncovers evidence of other crimes. 
                                  As Ashcroft suggested, prosecutors have not 
                                  hesitated to &#147;use every available statute&#148; 
                                  against suspected terrorists.</p>
                                <p>The growing post&#150;Cold War terrorist involvement 
                                  in criminal enterprises has provided more opportunity 
                                  for the government to prosecute suspected terrorists. 
                                  From a law enforcement perspective, it is critical 
                                  to minimize the advantage that terrorists gain 
                                  from involvement in criminal activity and maximize 
                                  the opportunity to prosecute them for the full 
                                  range of illegal activities in which they engage. 
                                  With this paradigm in mind, this paper explores 
                                  five areas of criminal enterprise where there 
                                  has been known terrorist involvement: drug trafficking, 
                                  financial scams, cyber-crime, illegal money 
                                  transfers, and immigration violations.</p>

                                <p>Terrorist groups have derived a great deal 
                                  of profit from the illegal drug trade. As <i>U.S. 
                                  News &amp; World Report</i> has stated, &#147;Nearly 
                                  half of the 41 groups on the government&#146;s 
                                  list of terrorist organizations are tied to 
                                  narcotics trafficking, according to DEA [Drug 
                                  Enforcement Agency] statistics.&#148;[<a href="#notes">8</a>]

                                <p>Terrorist involvement in drug trafficking began 
                                  with the collapse of the Soviet Union, as groups 
                                  that lost their major state sponsor were forced 
                                  to look for alternative funding sources. One 
                                  such source proved to be the drug trade. Moreover, 
                                  the fall of the Soviet Union coincided with 
                                  the rise of globalization, which is characterized 
                                  by instantaneous connectivity. This connectivity 
                                  has helped to facilitate terrorist involvement 
                                  in drug trafficking, as explained by Steven 
                                  W. Casteel, the DEA&#146;s assistant administrator 
                                  for intelligence:</p>
                                <blockquote>Globalization has dramatically changed 
                                  the face of both legitimate and illegitimate 
                                  enterprise. Criminals, by exploiting advances 
                                  in technology, finance, communications, and 
                                  transportation in pursuit of their illegal endeavors, 
                                  have become criminal entrepreneurs. Perhaps 
                                  the most alarming aspect of this &#147;entrepreneurial&#148; 
                                  style of crime is the intricate manner in which 
                                  drugs and terrorism may be intermingled. Not 
                                  only is the proliferation of illegal drugs perceived 
                                  as a danger, but the proceeds from the sale 
                                  of drugs provides a ready source for funding 
                                  of other criminal activities, including terrorism.[<a href="#notes">9</a>]</blockquote>
                                <p>The term &#147;narco-terrorism&#148;&#151;which

                                  The DEA defines a narco-terrorist organization 
                                  as &#147;an organized group that is complicit 
                                  in the activities of drug trafficking in order 
                                  to further, or fund, premeditated, politically

                                  1983 with a suicide bombing attack against a 
                                  Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 
                                  241 American servicemen.[<a href="#notes">13]</a> 
                                  With this single attack, Hizballah killed more

                                  These raids were directed at a drug ring that 
                                  had been smuggling pseudoephedrine tablets from

                                <blockquote>Beginning in the early 1990s, Shabib hauled

                                  to California, where his colleagues sold the 
                                  medicine to Mexican gangs that would turn it 
                                  into the street drug methamphetamine. It is 
                                  unclear exactly how much of this money went 
                                  to finance terrorism, but Shabib&#146;s drug

                                <p>Although drugs are forbidden within Islam and 
                                  are particularly taboo in the puritanical strain

                                  This involvement stretches back to the days 
                                  when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. A Western 
                                  antinarcotics official told <i>Time Asia</i> 
                                  that early in 2001, al-Qaeda&#146;s financial 
                                  experts teamed up with top Afghan drug traffickers 
                                  to persuade Taliban leader Mullah Omar to ban 
                                  opium cultivation. Although this move initially 
                                  appeared to combat the drug trade, it was actually 
                                  self-serving: opium prices soared from $30 a 
                                  kilogram to almost $650 after the ban, thus 
                                  benefiting al-Qaeda and its trafficker allies 
                                  who already had large stockpiles.</p>

                                  involvement is higher up the drug chain, where 
                                  profits are fatter and so is their cut of the

                                <blockquote>[Mirwais] Yasini, the Afghan antidrug 
                                  czar, says the terrorists receive a share of 
                                  profits from heroin sales by supplying gunmen 
                                  to protect labs and convoys. Recent busts have 
                                  revealed evidence of al-Qaeda&#146;s ties to 
                                  the trade. On New Year&#146;s Eve, a U.S. Navy 
                                  vessel in the Arabian Sea stopped a small fishing 
                                  boat that was carrying no fish. After a search, 
                                  says a Western antinarcotics official, &#147;they 
                                  found several al-Qaeda guys sitting on a bale 
                                  of drugs.&#148; In January, U.S. and Afghan 
                                  agents raided a drug runner&#146;s house in 
                                  Kabul and found a dozen or so satellite phones. 
                                  The phones were passed to the CIA station in 
                                  Kabul, which found they had been used to call 
                                  numbers linked to suspected terrorists in Turkey, 
                                  the Balkans and Western Europe. &#147;It was 
                                  an incredibly sophisticated network,&#148; says 
                                  the official. In March U.S. troops searching 
                                  a suspected terrorist hideout in Oruzgan province 
                                  after a firefight found opium with an estimated

                                  on its own. Opium continues to fuel half of

                                  a 2% eradication of opium production in 2006.[<a href="#notes">29</a>] 
                                  Al-Qaeda will likely continue to be involved 
                                  for two reasons. First, drug trafficking is 
                                  seemingly a significant source of revenue. Second, 
                                  the drug trade helps to destabilize Afghan president 
                                  Hamid Karzai&#146;s government. Since Karzai 
                                  is unable to tax the illegal sale of drugs, 
                                  the drug trade costs him money and influence.</p>

                                  because of his theological mentors&#151;that 
                                  drug trafficking was acceptable if the profits 
                                  were used to advance Islam. In fact, Jamal Ahmidan, 
                                  a Moroccan drug dealer who helped finance the 
                                  attacks, &#147;traded a load of hashish for

                                  go to bars and discos. <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> 
                                  reported that Ahmidan&#146;s neighbors thought 
                                  of him as &#147;friendly and flashy,&#148; and

                                  other infrastructure. Ahmidan rented a rickety

                                  a headquarters and bomb factory. He enlisted

                                <p>Identity theft is possibly the most lucrative 
                                  enterprise in which terrorists have engaged&#151;and

                                  Dennis Lormel, the chief of the FBI&#146;s Terrorism 
                                  Financial Review Group, explained in testimony 
                                  before the U.S. Senate that technological advances 
                                  have made it easier than ever to commit identity 
                                  theft.[<a href="#notes">37</a>] Advances in 
                                  computer hardware and software as well as the 
                                  growth of the Internet have made it easier to

                                <p>One critical aspect of identity theft, according 
                                  to Lormel, is the &#147;cloak of anonymity&#148; 
                                  that it provides.[<a href="#notes">38</a>] He 
                                  noted that identities are often stolen in order 
                                  to carry out such violations of federal law 
                                  as bank fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, 
                                  mail fraud, bankruptcy fraud, and computer crimes. 
                                  Moreover, this cloak of anonymity means that 
                                  &#147;[t]he use of a stolen identity enhances 
                                  the chances of success in the commission of 
                                  almost all financial crimes.&#148;[<a href="#notes">39</a>] 
                                  In the context of terrorism, identity theft 
                                  poses an additional danger because terrorists 
                                  can use their new identities to avoid the watchful 
                                  eyes of federal investigators as they plan and 
                                  prepare for attacks.</p>
                                <p><i>The 9/11 Commission Report</i> established 
                                  that terrorists have committed identity fraud. 
                                  &#147;For terrorists,&#148; the report noted, 
                                  &#147;travel documents are as important as weapons. 
                                  Terrorists must travel clandestinely to meet, 
                                  train, plan, case targets, and gain access to 
                                  attack.&#148;[<a href="#notes">40</a>] The report 
                                  went on to say that terrorists have used &#147;altered

                                  it warned that &#147;[f]raud in identification

                                  including gates for boarding aircraft, sources 
                                  of identification are the last opportunity to

                                  that the connection between identity theft and 
                                  terrorism received short shrift in congressional

                                  find identity theft desirable: avoiding watch 
                                  lists; obscuring their whereabouts; funding 
                                  terrorist activities; and gaining unauthorized 
                                  access to &#147;entry points such as airline

                                <p>Identity theft doesn&#146;t just benefit terrorists: 
                                  it also harms the society against which it is 
                                  directed. The FBI&#146;s <i>Financial Crimes 
                                  Report</i> to the Public, released in mid-2005, 
                                  noted that identity theft hurts the monetary 
                                  victims of the fraud but can also be devastating 
                                  to the individual whose identity is stolen:</p>
                                 
                                <blockquote>[T]he individual victim of the identity 
                                  theft may experience a severe loss in their

                                  identity. The loss can be short in duration, 
                                  or may extend for years. It may result in the 
                                  inability to cash checks, obtain credit, purchase 
                                  a home or, in the most insidious cases, the 
                                  arrest of the individual for crimes committed 
                                  by the identity thief.[<a href="#notes">46</a>]

                                <p>Identity fraud constitutes a violation of federal 
                                  law. Federal code 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1028 lists 
                                  eight kinds of prohibited activity, including 
                                  producing identity documents without legal authority, 
                                  transferring stolen or forged identity documents, 
                                  possessing such documents, or trafficking in 
                                  false authentication features or false identity 
                                  documents. There is also a federal statute for 
                                  aggravated identity theft that covers acts of 
                                  identity fraud that occur in relation to acts 
                                  of terrorism transcending national boundaries.[<a href="#notes">47</a>] 
                                  However, as previously discussed, it is often 
                                  difficult to prove involvement in a terrorist 
                                  plot beyond a reasonable doubt; that&#146;s 
                                  why Attorney General Ashcroft recommended adopting 
                                  a law enforcement strategy similar to the one 
                                  employed against Al Capone and the mob. Applying 
                                  that model, a suspected terrorist taking part 
                                  in identity theft is more likely to be convicted 
                                  under the statute for simple identity fraud 
                                  rather than aggravated identity theft.</p>

                                <p>A number of individual crimes can be considered

                                  is that they are designed to defraud financial 
                                  institutions. According to the U.S. Code, the

                                <p>Cigarette smuggling is an arbitrage scheme 
                                  that has been used to raise funds for terrorist 
                                  groups from within the United States. Central 
                                  to such smuggling schemes is the variance in 
                                  cigarette tax rates between the states. Some 
                                  states, such as Virginia and North Carolina, 
                                  have low cigarette taxes. Others, like New Jersey 
                                  and New York, have higher cigarette taxes. In 
                                  a cigarette smuggling scheme, the smugglers 
                                  purchase large volumes of cigarettes in states 
                                  that have low tax rates and resell them below 
                                  market prices in states with high cigarette 
                                  taxes. They&#146;re able to undersell the market 
                                  since the smugglers don&#146;t pay taxes on 
                                  the cigarettes they resell. Steven Emerson has 
                                  explained that such schemes can yield extraordinary 
                                  profits:</p>
                                 
                                <blockquote>As a senior ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, 
                                  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] official explained, 
                                  such smuggling is quite lucrative. For example, 
                                  a smuggler could buy a carton (ten packs) of 
                                  cigarettes for around $20 in Virginia (where, 
                                  until September 2004, the cigarette tax was 
                                  2.5 cents per pack), and then resell it in New 
                                  York City (where the tax is $1.50 per pack) 
                                  for about $40 a carton. A single truckload of 
                                  cigarettes can yield a $2 million profit.[<a href="#notes">51</a>]

                                <p>The best-known case of cigarette smuggling 
                                  involved a cell in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
                                  that raised money for Hizballah. Brothers Mohamad 
                                  Hammoud and Chawki Youssef Hammoud would buy 
                                  van loads of cigarettes in North Carolina, where 
                                  the tax was 5 cents per pack, and transport 
                                  them to Michigan, where the tax was 75 cents 
                                  a pack. Douglas Farah has noted that &#147;[t]he 
                                  brothers could clear $8 to $10 per carton, and 
                                  each van load netted them up to $13,000.&#148;[<a href="#notes">52</a>]

                                  groups. By mid-2004, the ATF had more than 300 
                                  open cases of illegal cigarette trafficking, 
                                  and an official reported that several of these 
                                  were linked to terrorist fund-raising. Assistant

                                <p>Cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism are emerging 
                                  threats. Some kinds of cyber-crime are simply 
                                  financial crimes that make use of the Internet. 
                                  For example, from December 1999 to April 2000, 
                                  five Moscow-based hackers stole about 5,400 
                                  credit card numbers from Internet retailers 
                                  and pocketed about $630,000, before their arrest.[<a href="#notes">62</a>] 
                                  As with other kinds of financial crimes, law 
                                  enforcement should maintain a watchful eye for 
                                  terrorist links to cyber-crime.</p>
                                <p>But there is another danger: catastrophic cyber-terrorism. 
                                  So far, this threat has not been actualized. 
                                  But law enforcement&#151;as well as businesses, 
                                  government agencies, and even individuals&#151;should 
                                  be aware of it. H. H. Whiteman, director general 
                                  of Transport Canada&#146;s security and emergency 
                                  preparedness, wrote that &#147;[c]yber terrorism 
                                  must be considered to include the full range 
                                  of threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and technological

                                  economic consequences.&#148;[<a href="#notes">64</a>] 
                                  Civil aviation is a tempting target and is &#147;extraordinarily 
                                  dependent on computer-telecommunications information 
                                  systems.&#148;[<a href="#notes">65</a>] </p>
                                <p>There is evidence that cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism 
                                  are growing increasingly attractive to terrorists. 
                                  Gabriel Weimann, a senior fellow at the United 
                                  States Institute of Peace, has listed five major 
                                  reasons for the attraction to cyber-terrorism.[<a href="#notes">66</a>] 
                                  First, it&#146;s cost effective: all that a 
                                  terrorist needs to carry out an act of cyber-terrorism 
                                  is a personal computer with Internet access. 
                                  Second, there is relative anonymity in cyber-terrorism. 
                                  Terrorists need not be physically present at 
                                  an attack and can use screen names and other 
                                  cloaks of anonymity to disguise themselves from 
                                  authorities. Third, there are a large number 
                                  of targets. A cyber-terrorist could &#147;target 
                                  the computers and computer networks of governments, 
                                  individuals, public utilities, private airlines, 
                                  and so forth.&#148;[<a href="#notes">67</a>] 
                                  Critical infrastructure such as electric power 
                                  grids and emergency services would be vulnerable. 
                                  Fourth, it&#146;s easier for an organization 
                                  to recruit people for cyber-terrorist attacks 
                                  because their remote nature means less need 
                                  for physical training and risk of mortality. 
                                  Finally, cyber-terrorism can affect a larger 
                                  number of people than traditional terrorist 
                                  methods. This fact can be seen in the speed 
                                  with which destructive computer viruses spread 
                                  throughout the world.</p>
                                <p>Terrorists&#146; increasingly sophisticated 
                                  use of the Internet provides further reason 
                                  for concern about the threat of cyber-terrorism. 
                                  One example is a hacker called Irhabi 007, which 
                                  translates as &#147;Terrorist 007.&#148; For 
                                  two years, Irhabi 007 served as an al-Qaeda 
                                  conduit and had &#147;hacked into American university 
                                  computers, propagandized for the Iraq insurgents 
                                  led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and taught other 
                                  online jihadists how to wield their computers 
                                  for the cause.&#148;[<a href="#notes">68</a>] 
                                  A case study produced by the SITE Institute, 
                                  a Washington, D.C.&#150;based counterterrorism 
                                  research center that monitors online jihadist 
                                  activity, explains that &#147;Irhabi changed 
                                  the face of the jihadi Internet world through 
                                  his ability to covertly and securely disseminate 
                                  violent materials including manuals of weaponry, 
                                  videos of jihadist feats, such as the beheadings 
                                  perpetrated by Iraqi insurgents, and other inflammatory 
                                  media files.&#148;[<a href="#notes">69</a>]</p>
                                <p>When Scotland Yard officials arrested four 
                                  youths suspected of taking part in a bomb plot 
                                  in October 2005, one of those men, Younis Tsouli, 
                                  turned out to be Irhabi 007.[<a href="#notes">70</a>] 
                                  Before his arrest, Irhabi managed to pave the 
                                  way for future online jihadists. For example, 
                                  in June 2005 he posted a long message on an 
                                  al-Qaeda message forum titled &#147;Seminar 
                                  on Hacking Websites,&#148; which provided readers 
                                  with a detailed study of hacking that was over 
                                  twenty pages long.[<a href="#notes">71</a>] 
                                  The example of Irhabi 007 shows not only the 
                                  threat of cyber-crime and cyber-terrorism but 
                                  is also indicative of the increasingly sophisticated 
                                  means of propagandizing for terrorist groups.</p>
                                <p>Another sign of this increasing sophistication 
                                  came in the wake of the controversy over Danish 
                                  cartoons satirizing Prophet Muhammad that resulted 
                                  in rioting throughout the Muslim world in February 
                                  2006. In early February 2006, the British computer 
                                  magazine Computer Shopper noted that &#147;[g]angs 
                                  of pro-Muslim computer hackers have unleashed 
                                  a withering cyber attack on Danish and Western 
                                  websites in the past week.&#148;[<a href="#notes">72</a>] 
                                  Some 578 Danish websites were knocked off-line 
                                  in a single week.</p>
                                <p>There are many mechanisms that terrorists could 
                                  use to target the &#147;virtual world.&#148; 
                                  The U.S. Army&#146;s handbook <i>Cyber Operations 
                                  and Cyber Terrorism</i> illuminates some of 
                                  these tools.[<a href="#notes">73</a>] Of particular 
                                  concern are computer worms, which are destructive 
                                  software programs containing codes capable of 
                                  gaining access to a computer or network and 
                                  causing harm by deleting or manipulating the 
                                  data. In a worst-case scenario that policymakers 
                                  fear, a worm that infects the U.S. financial 
                                  sector could shut down Wall Street, or one infecting 
                                  airlines&#146; databases could result in millions 
                                  of missed flights or even downed flights. Another 
                                  concern is computer viruses, which are designed 
                                  to infect and damage software programs.</p>
                                <p>For some time, pure cyber-terrorism has been 
                                  seen as a threat that hasn&#146;t yet actualized. 
                                  A 1999 report released by the Center for the 
                                  Study of Terrorism and Irregular Warfare at 
                                  the Naval Postgraduate School stated that &#147;pure 
                                  cyberterrorism is a thing of the future. For 
                                  the present, terrorists are much more likely 
                                  to pursue cyberterror as an ancillary tool. 
                                  However, as time and resources permit, groups 
                                  of certain ideological types at particular growth 
                                  stages will attempt to build on already existing 
                                  cyberterror capabilities.&#148;[<a href="#notes">74</a>] 
                                  Eight years later, the time may fast be approaching 
                                  when cyber-terror is seen as far more than an 
                                  ancillary tool.</p>

                                <p>This paper has already shown that terrorist 
                                  groups see the United States as fertile ground 
                                  for terrorist fund-raising. Another criminal 
                                  act, complementary to terrorist fund-raising, 
                                  is the illegal transfer of funds to terrorist 
                                  groups. This process has been carried out in 
                                  different ways. This section outlines four examples: 
                                  the Benevolence International Foundation, the 
                                  Holy Land Foundation, Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, 
                                  and Hizballah.</p>
                                <p><b><i>Benevolence International Foundation</i></b></p>
                                <p>The Benevolence International Foundation (BIF) 
                                  was an Islamic charity founded and incorporated 
                                  in Palos Hills, Illinois, in March 1992.[<a href="#notes">75</a>] 
                                  At its inception, one of BIF&#146;s directors 
                                  was Sheikh Adel Abdul Jalil Batterjee, who was 
                                  affiliated with the &#147;Golden Chain&#148; 
                                  group from the Persian Gulf&#151;a group of 
                                  wealthy donors who financed the mujahideen in 
                                  the Afghan-Soviet war during the 1980s and went 
                                  on to become major al-Qaeda backers.[<a href="#notes">76</a>] 
                                  BIF achieved tax-exempt status as a charitable 
                                  organization in March 1993. Around that time, 
                                  BIF replaced Batterjee and the other founding 
                                  directors with new directors, one of whom was 
                                  Enaam Arnaout.[<a href="#notes">77</a>] </p>
                                <p>The FBI began to investigate BIF in 1998 after 
                                  a Washington, D.C., conference that an agent 
                                  attended. There, the agent &#147;learned of 
                                  foreign intelligence reports indicating that 
                                  Arnaout was involved in providing logistical 
                                  support for jihadists.&#148;[<a href="#notes">78</a>] 
                                  Opening a full field investigation in 1999, 
                                  the FBI&#146;s Chicago field office put BIF&#146;s 
                                  headquarters under surveillance and even dug 
                                  through its garbage.[<a href="#notes">79</a>] 
                                  Before 9/11, the FBI was unable to bring a criminal 
                                  case even though agents had come across suspicious 
                                  material during the search and even though the 
                                  agents involved &#147;believed BIF had substantial 
                                  ties to al Qaeda, was supporting jihad, and 
                                  was sending a great deal of money overseas.&#148;[<a href="#notes">80</a>] 
                                </p>
                                <p>After 9/11, more information was made available 
                                  to the FBI. For example, al-Qaeda cooperators 
                                  whom the FBI was allowed to interview after 
                                  9/11 revealed BIF&#146;s financial dealings 
                                  with al-Qaeda in the early 1990s.[<a href="#notes">81</a>] 
                                  This new information allowed the Treasury Department&#146;s 
                                  Office of Foreign Assets Control to freeze BIF&#146;s 
                                  assets as a specially designated terrorist organization,[<a href="#notes">82</a>] 
                                  and the FBI finally garnered enough evidence 
                                  for a criminal case. Ultimately, Arnaout pleaded 
                                  guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy 
                                  for fraudulently diverting charitable donations 
                                  to finance overseas combatants.[<a href="#notes">83</a>]<br>
                                  <br>
                                  At his sentencing, Arnaout admitted to supporting 
                                  various kinds of jihadist groups overseas through 
                                  BIF. He admitted that BIF sent boots to mujahideen 
                                  in Chechnya; boots, tents, and uniforms to soldiers 
                                  in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and uniforms for a provisional, 
                                  unrecognized government in Chechnya. The court 
                                  found that BIF had diverted a total of $315,624 
                                  to overseas fighters.[<a href="#notes">84</a>] 
                                  The indictment also drew heavily from documents 
                                  seized from BIF&#146;s Bosnia offices to link 
                                  BIF and Arnaout to the formation of al-Qaeda.[<a href="#notes">85</a>] 
                                  However, as part of the plea agreement, the 
                                  government agreed to drop charges that BIF had 
                                  supported al-Qaeda and its affiliates. The plea 
                                  agreement prevented the court from weighing 
                                  the evidence on this point.</p>
                                <p>For a long time, BIF was able to use its tax-exempt 
                                  status and reputation as a charitable organization 
                                  to conceal its funding of foreign fighters. 
                                  It hid this funding from authorities by lumping 
                                  its donations to military operations into other 
                                  donations that were devoted to legitimate charity 
                                  work.</p>

                                <p>The organization that came to be known as the 
                                  Holy Land Foundation (HLF) originally assumed 
                                  the name &#147;Occupied Land Fund.&#148; It 
                                  was created in about 1998 for the purpose of 
                                  providing support for Hamas, which has been 
                                  responsible for a large number of attacks against 
                                  Israeli civilians and other targets. Originally 
                                  located in California, the group moved to Richardson, 
                                  Texas, where it eventually became known as the 
                                  Holy Land Foundation, a tax-exempt charity whose 
                                  stated objective was to provide support to the 
                                  needy in the West Bank and Gaza.[<a href="#notes">86</a>]

                                <p>HLF had a long-standing relationship with Hamas. 
                                  During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, HLF 
                                  openly provided support for Hamas, which was 
                                  named a specially designated terrorist organization 
                                  in 1995.[<a href="#notes">87</a>] Shortly after 
                                  its creation, HLF sent approximately $100,000 
                                  to Abu Marzook, Hamas&#146;s future political 
                                  bureau chief. HLF also sent $725,000 to the 
                                  Islamic Center of Gaza, which Hamas spiritual 
                                  leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin established to serve 
                                  as a front for Hamas activity.[<a href="#notes">88</a>] 
                                  HLF sponsored a number of conferences and conventions 
                                  featuring radical sheikhs and Hamas officials 
                                  that were designed to help them raise funds; 
                                  some events featured songs and skits depicting 
                                  the killing of Jews.[<a href="#notes">89</a>] 
                                  After the Oslo Accords, which were designed 
                                  to promote peace between Israel and the Palestinians, 
                                  HLF&#146;s principals met with Hamas activists 
                                  in Philadelphia to try to determine how HLF 
                                  could support Hamas&#146;s &#147;opposition 
                                  to the peace plan and to decide how to conceal 
                                  their activities from the scrutiny of the United 
                                  States government.&#148;[<a href="#notes">90</a>] 
                                  And HLF subsidized Hamas&#146;s &#147;vital 
                                  recruitment and reward efforts in the West Bank 
                                  and Gaza.&#148;[<a href="#notes">91</a>] Multiple 
                                  links exist between HLF and Hamas.</p>
                                <p>The Holy Land Foundation was ultimately indicted 
                                  for money laundering. Money laundering refers 
                                  to the metaphorical &#147;cleansing&#148; of 
                                  money. Individuals and groups can engage in 
                                  money laundering in many different ways, ranging 
                                  from bulk cash smuggling to trade-based money 
                                  laundering to online payment systems.[<a href="#notes">92</a>] 
                                  There are two basic kinds of money laundering.</p>
                                <p>The first kind is designed to disguise the 
                                  fact that drug dealers and others who profit 
                                  from illegal ventures obtained the money illegally. 
                                  Thus, the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
                                  Crime defines money laundering as a &#147;three-stage 
                                  process which disguises illegal profits without 
                                  compromising the criminals who wish to benefit 
                                  from the proceeds. This requires: first, moving 
                                  the funds from direct association with the crime; 
                                  second, disguising the trail to foil pursuit; 
                                  and third, making the money available to the 
                                  criminal once again with the occupational and 
                                  geographic origins hidden from view.&#148;[<a href="#notes">93</a>] 
                                </p>
                                <p>The second kind of money laundering is designed 
                                  not to disguise the source of funds but rather 
                                  their <i>destination</i>&#151;in that the money 
                                  in question is going to finance illegal activities 
                                  overseas. U.S. law prohibits this type of money 
                                  laundering as well.[<a href="#notes">94</a>] 
                                </p>
                                <p>HLF was indicted on twelve counts of money 
                                  laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit 
                                  money laundering.[<a href="#notes">95</a>] The 
                                  indictment charges that HLF &#147;transmitted 
                                  or caused to be transmitted approximately $12,400,000 
                                  to various HAMAS controlled zakat committees 
                                  and organizations.&#148;[<a href="#notes">96</a>] 
                                  The indictment lists seventeen wire transfers 
                                  that were designed to support these organizations, 
                                  as well as twelve instances in which the HLF 
                                  defendants transmitted funds to the West Bank 
                                  and Gaza with the intent to contribute funds, 
                                  goods, and services to Hamas. These wire transfers 
                                  and transmissions allegedly violate U.S. laws 
                                  against money laundering.[<a href="#notes">97</a>]

                                <p>Like BIF, HLF appears to have used its tax-exempt 
                                  status and reputation to conceal the funding 
                                  of terrorism. The criminal case against HLF

                                  Central to the prosecution was the requirement

                                  The actions that investigators honed in on began 
                                  in February 2000, when an Egyptian man wire 
                                  transferred about $150,000 to a bank account 
                                  in Ashland belonging to Al Haramain.[<a href="#notes">104</a>] 
                                  In an e-mail, the donor stated that the money 
                                  was designed &#147;to participate in your noble

                                  one of Al Haramain&#146;s directors, Soliman 
                                  al-But&#146;he, flew from Saudi Arabia to the

                                  Pete Seda (a.k.a Pirouz Sedaghaty). On March 
                                  10, the two men went to a branch office of Bank 
                                  of America and bought 130 American Express traveler&#146;s 
                                  checks, all in the $1,000 denomination.[<a href="#notes">105</a>]

                                  and cashier&#146;s check. On the way out, he 
                                  failed to file a Form 4790 indicating that he 
                                  was transporting $150,000 out of the United

                                <p>A number of individuals and groups that raised 
                                  money for Hizballah in the United States illegally 
                                  transferred money and other items of support 
                                  to the terrorist group. One such case, detailed 
                                  above, is the cigarette-smuggling cell in Charlotte, 
                                  North Carolina. The second superseding indictment 
                                  in that case explains that members of the terrorist 
                                  cell sent money to Hizballah leaders and also 
                                  purchased equipment that they sent to Lebanon. 
                                  This equipment included night-vision goggles, 
                                  global positioning systems, mine- and metal-detection 
                                  equipment, advanced aircraft analysis and design 
                                  software, stun guns, and laser range finders.[<a href="#notes">108</a>] 
                                  Ultimately, the defendants in the Charlotte 
                                  case were convicted under a Patriot Act provision 
                                  that outlaws providing anything of value to

                                  For example, after the indictment of a Dearborn,

                                  and counterfeiting was unsealed in March 2006 
                                  (as mentioned above), the DOJ&#146;s press release 
                                  explained that the group had engaged in these 
                                  criminal enterprises in order to launder money.[<a href="#notes">110</a>]

                                <p>Money raised in the U.S. through both legal 
                                  and illegal means has frequently made its way 
                                  to terrorist groups in the Middle East. Authorities 
                                  can vigorously counteract terrorist financing 
                                  by being cognizant of organizations that are 
                                  known affiliates of terrorists or terrorist 
                                  groups, or else supportive of terrorists&#146; 
                                  messages&#151;and should check their bank and 
                                  other financial records to determine whether

                                  Law enforcement should also keep abreast of 
                                  ways that terrorists adapt in an effort to thwart 
                                  investigations. Stuart Levey, undersecretary 
                                  of the Treasury&#146;s Office of Terrorism and 
                                  Financial Intelligence, said in Senate testimony 
                                  that his office has witnessed &#147;a decrease 
                                  in the average amount of transactions that we 
                                  learn about.&#148;[<a href="#notes">111</a>] 
                                  Levey remarked:</p>
                                 
                                <blockquote>[T]his observation carries across 
                                  various financial conduits and terrorist organizations 
                                  and we have no reason to believe that it is 
                                  unrepresentative. Interpreting this indicator 
                                  is more difficult. It could reflect an overall 
                                  decrease in the amount of money moving to and 
                                  from terrorists. Just as easily, it could indicate 
                                  that terrorists are breaking their transactions 
                                  out into smaller sums, fearing interception. 
                                  Alternatively, the trend could be an outgrowth 
                                  of a movement by terrorist organizations away 
                                  from banks towards less formal mechanisms, like 
                                  cash couriers.[<a href="#notes">112</a>] </blockquote>
                                <p>Terrorists frequently adapt to policing and 
                                  intelligence measures. For example, after learning 
                                  that the National Security Agency could monitor 
                                  only the e-mails that had been sent, some terrorists 
                                  began using shared e-mail accounts (to which 
                                  all members of a cell would have the password) 
                                  and saving messages as drafts. Since the messages 
                                  were never sent, terrorists were able to avoid 
                                  NSA surveillance. Likewise, terrorists may be 
                                  adapting to anti-money-laundering efforts.</p>

                                <p>For many terrorists, immigration violations 
                                  are the first acts taken in a long line of criminal 
                                  activities. A significant number of terrorists 
                                  who came from overseas have done so illegally, 
                                  through such mechanisms as document fraud and 
                                  sham marriages. Michael Cutler, a fellow at 
                                  the Center for Immigration Studies, has written 
                                  that when &#147;an alien acquires immigration 
                                  benefits through fraud and deception, the security 
                                  of the system is breached and it leaves the 
                                  door open to criminals and terrorists gaming 
                                  the system.&#148;[<a href="#notes">113</a>]</p>
                                <p>Individuals who have planned acts of terror 
                                  against the United States or raised money for 
                                  terrorist organizations have often engaged in 
                                  immigration violations. Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind 
                                  of the first World Trade Center attack, in 1993, 
                                  used an altered passport and fraudulent documents.[<a href="#notes">114</a>] 
                                  Some members of the Charlotte cell that raised 
                                  money for Hizballah were in the country illegally. 
                                  Following 9/11, the government has aggressively 
                                  pursued immigration violation cases against 
                                  known Islamic radicals and individuals who are 
                                  suspected of terrorist ties.</p>
                                <p><i><b>Document Fraud</b></i></p>
                                <p>Several kinds of document fraud can occur during 
                                  the immigration process. Document fraud, through 
                                  forgery, lying, false statements, or the misuse 
                                  of visas, is punishable under federal law. The 
                                  Immigration and Naturalization Act makes it 
                                  illegal for an alien to use, acquire, or provide 
                                  fraudulent documents for the purpose of acquiring 
                                  citizenship or naturalization.[<a href="#notes">115</a>] 
                                  Document fraud violations may result in civil 
                                  and criminal penalties. Most significantly, 
                                  there are also immigration consequences: an 
                                  alien who is culpable in document fraud may 
                                  be prevented from receiving visas to be admitted 
                                  to the United States.[<a href="#notes">116</a>] 
                                  Document fraud &#147;is also a ground for deportability.&#148;[<a href="#notes">117</a>]

                                <p>Suspected terrorists have been deported from 
                                  the U.S. or else arrested for document fraud. 
                                  One example is Fawaz Damra, a Cleveland-based 
                                  imam who was born in the West Bank. In 2004, 
                                  Damra was convicted of lying on his citizenship 
                                  application by failing to disclose his links 
                                  to terrorist organizations.[<a href="#notes">118</a>] 
                                  Even though he was convicted of an immigration 
                                  violation rather than terrorism charges, government 
                                  attorneys sought Damra&#146;s deportation &#147;because 
                                  they consider him a national security threat.&#148;[<a href="#notes">119</a>] 
                                </p>
                                <p> Ultimately, Damra agreed to be deported in 
                                  January 2006. Another example is Maher Amin 
                                  Jaradat, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Palestinian 
                                  descent, who was indicted in May 2005 for making 
                                  false statements on his application for citizenship: 
                                  he failed to disclose his membership in the 
                                  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.[<a href="#notes">120</a>]

                                <p>But in the past, there may have been under-enforcement 
                                  of immigration laws when it comes to known terrorists 
                                  operating in the United States. Janice Kephart, 
                                  former counsel to the 9/11 Commission, authored 
                                  a report titled <i>Immigration and Terrorism</i>, 
                                  which examines the histories of ninety-four 
                                  foreign-born terrorists who operated in the 
                                  United States between the early 1990s and 2004.[<a href="#notes">121</a>] 
                                  It concludes that of these ninety-four terrorists, 
                                  &#147;about two-thirds (59) committed immigration 
                                  fraud prior to or in conjunction with taking 
                                  part in terrorist activity.&#148;[<a href="#notes">122</a>] 
                                  Because of these widespread terrorist violations 
                                  of U.S. immigration law, Kephart suggests that 
                                  the &#147;lax immigration system&#148; poses 
                                  a danger and recommends &#147;strict enforcement 
                                  of immigration law&#151;at American consulates 
                                  overseas, at ports of entry, and within the 
                                  United States.&#148;[<a href="#notes">123</a>] 
                                </p>
                                <p>The report details various methods that terrorists 
                                  have used to enter the United States. Those 
                                  covered in her study applied for naturalization 
                                  twenty-one times; twenty applications succeeded. 
                                  Yet she notes that there were &#147;eleven clear 
                                  indications of fraud&#148; in these applications, 
                                  including document fraud and withholding of 
                                  material facts.[<a href="#notes">124</a>] Kephart 
                                  notes that with naturalization comes a U.S. 
                                  passport, which can create particular problems. 
                                  For example, Iyman Faris, who in 2003 admitted 
                                  to plotting to cut the Brooklyn Bridge&#146;s 
                                  suspension cable and derail passenger trains 
                                  on orders from al-Qaeda, was a naturalized U.S. 
                                  citizen.[<a href="#notes">125</a>] Thus, after

                                <p><i><b>Sham Marriages</b></i></p>
                                <p>Sham marriage is a commonly used method of 
                                  allowing terrorists to stay in the United States, 
                                  even opening the door for them to become permanent 
                                  residents or naturalized citizens. Federal law 
                                  allows an alien who is a spouse of a U.S. citizen 
                                  to be considered the citizen&#146;s immediate 
                                  relative, thus allowing the alien to gain lawful 
                                  permanent residency in the U.S.[<a href="#notes">127</a>] 
                                  Great leeway is provided for aliens to remain 
                                  in the United States if they are able to marry 
                                  a citizen. However, federal law also prohibits 
                                  marriage fraud, which is defined as a marriage 
                                  that is entered into solely &#147;for the purpose 
                                  of evading any provision of the immigration 
                                  laws.&#148;[<a href="#notes">128</a>] </p>
                                <p>A number of terrorists and terror supporters 
                                  affiliated with al-Qaeda, Hizballah, and the 
                                  Palestinian Islamic Jihad used sham marriages 
                                  to stay in the United States. One example is 
                                  the Charlotte Hizballah cell, where one of the 
                                  key figures was Said Mohamad Harb. Kephart writes 
                                  that Harb &#147;helped secure three fraudulent 
                                  visas and three sham marriages for the purpose 
                                  of &#145;legally&#146; bringing in the United 
                                  States his brother, his brother-in-law, and 
                                  sister so that they might become legal permanent

                                  who lived together rather than with their &#147;husbands.&#148;</p>
                                <p>Immigration laws should be our first line of 
                                  defense against those who would enter the United 
                                  States to raise money for terrorist groups or 
                                  participate in acts of terrorism. So there is 
                                  a national security reason to ensure that immigration 
                                  laws are not under-enforced when individuals 
                                  violating these laws are suspected of involvement 
                                  in terrorism. Clamping down on immigration violations 
                                  is one of the government&#146;s major tools 
                                  in employing the Al Capone model of preventing 
                                  another major terrorist attack on U.S. soil. 
                                  In mid-2005, the <i>Washington Post</i> noted 
                                  that &#147;in the past two years, officials 
                                  have filed immigration charges against more 
                                  than 500 people who have come under scrutiny 
                                  in national security investigations.&#148;[<a href="#notes">130</a>] 
                                  The reason for the high number of immigration 
                                  charges is that authorities are using immigration 
                                  laws against suspected terrorists.</p>

                                  <b>IMPLICATIONS OF THE AL CAPONE MODEL</b></p>
                                <p>Many analysts have wondered why the United 
                                  States hasn&#146;t been attacked since 9/11. 
                                  Surely, terrorists have not lost their desire 
                                  to attack America, as successful attacks in 
                                  Britain, Egypt, Indonesia, Israel, the Philippines, 
                                  Russia, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey, and many other 
                                  countries make clear. While there is no single 
                                  answer to this question, the government&#146;s 
                                  law enforcement model seems to have played an 
                                  important role.</p>
                                <p>The Al Capone model of anti-terror policing 
                                  holds that law enforcement should disrupt would-be 
                                  terrorists before they can strike. Terrorists 
                                  can be disrupted through prosecution of all 
                                  crimes committed, including minor offenses. 
                                  As this paper has shown, there are many indications 
                                  of heavy terrorist involvement in criminal activity. 
                                  This criminal involvement, coupled with the 
                                  increasing difficulty of winning convictions 
                                  for terrorism offenses, makes pursuing lesser 
                                  offenses worthwhile.</p>
                                <p><i><b>The British Experience</b></i></p>
                                <p>British law enforcement and intelligence has 
                                  had many notable successes in dismantling terrorist 
                                  cells. However, some of the failures of British 
                                  anti-terror policing highlight the importance 
                                  of the Al Capone model&#146;s aggressive pursuit 
                                  of leads and disruptive prosecutions. This pursuit 
                                  of leads involves not only digging until there&#146;s 
                                  no more dirt but also undertaking cross-referencing 
                                  and background checks of other subjects who 
                                  are found to be associated with radicals or 
                                  potential terrorists. Often when an individual 
                                  or group that is being investigated meets or 
                                  develops a relationship with another individual 
                                  or group, it&#146;s for a reason.</p>
                                <p>The British system tends to let radicals operate 
                                  longer because of the intelligence benefits 
                                  gained from seeing what the suspects do. The 
                                  problem is that this policing model allows some 
                                  terrorists to slip through the cracks, as shown 
                                  in the wake of a recently concluded trial in 
                                  which five men were sentenced to life in prison 
                                  for a plot to attack a number of London targets 
                                  with bombs made of fertilizer (known as the 
                                  &#147;fertilizer plot&#148;). Before the fertilizer 
                                  plotters were arrested in March 2004, they had 
                                  come into contact with 7/7 transit-bomb plotters 
                                  Mohammed Siddique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer. 
                                  Agents listening in on a bug monitoring the 
                                  fertilizer plotters heard Khan state that he 
                                  planned to kill non-Muslims; moreover, a tracking 
                                  device was placed in Khan&#146;s car a year 
                                  before the 7/7 attacks, his meetings with radicals 
                                  were reported to British domestic spy agency 
                                  MI5 at least four times, and he underwent terrorist 
                                  training in Pakistan with some of the fertilizer 
                                  plotters.[<a href="#notes">131</a>] Nevertheless, 
                                  counterterrorism officials were forced to concede 
                                  after the fertilizer-plot trial that &#147;intelligence 
                                  that could have raised alarms before the July 
                                  7 transit attacks was never thoroughly investigated.&#148;[<a href="#notes">132</a>] 
                                  Those attacks ended up killing fifty-two people.</p>
                                <p>British counterterrorism officials explained 
                                  that they never thoroughly investigated the 
                                  7/7 bombers because other intelligence leads 
                                  seemed more urgent. The Intelligence and Security 
                                  Committee&#146;s investigation into the London 
                                  attacks states that because of limited resources, 
                                  &#147;it was decided not to investigate [Khan 
                                  and Tanweer] further or seek to identify them. 
                                  When resources became available, attempts were 
                                  made to find out more about these two and other 
                                  peripheral contacts, but these resources were 
                                  soon diverted back to what were considered to 
                                  be higher investigative priorities.&#148;[<a href="#notes">133</a>] 
                                  But MI5&#146;s report on links between the 7/7 
                                  bombers and the fertilizer plotters reveals 
                                  that MI5 <i>did</i> have enough information 
                                  to prosecute Khan and Tanweer&#151;for lesser 
                                  offenses. The report shows that Khan and Tanweer 
                                  met with the fertilizer plotters on five occasions, 
                                  and explained methods of fund-raising to them: 
                                  &#147;Conversations record Khan and Tanweer 
                                  discussing how to raise cash through a variety 
                                  of fraud scams, such as purchasing building 
                                  equipment on credit, defaulting on payment and 
                                  selling the goods on for cash.&#148;[<a href="#notes">134</a>]

                                <p>Under the British model of anti-terror policing, 
                                  Khan and Tanweer were allowed to continue operating 
                                  even though they shared their criminal expertise 
                                  with known terrorists and expressed a desire 
                                  to kill British citizens. In contrast, they 
                                  probably would have been picked up under the 
                                  Al Capone model and tried for their involvement 
                                  in financial scams. In the situation that the 
                                  British faced&#151;when so many potential plots 
                                  are being investigated that not all leads can 
                                  be aggressively pursued&#151;there is even more 
                                  reason to arrest radicals who are clearly involved 
                                  in criminal enterprise in order to disrupt their 
                                  activities. Had the British done so, the 7/7 
                                  attacks may have been prevented.</p>

                                  threat is much less than originally assumed 
                                  or else &#147;the policies of the United States 
                                  have reduced the threat through deterrence, 
                                  and, yes, through excessive vigilance.&#148;[<a href="#notes">137</a>] 
                                  The report then concludes that there seems to

                                  currently within the U.S.&#148; and argues that 
                                  &#147;[a]ny future policy must be premised on 
                                  this conclusion.&#148;[<a href="#notes">138</a>] 
                                  Although this statement is vague, it suggests 
                                  that a less aggressive law enforcement model 
                                  should be adopted.</p>
                                <p>The <i>Terrorist Trial Report Card</i> is clearly 
                                  critical of the Al Capone model of anti-terror 
                                  policing. Its first conclusion is that the current 
                                  model only works if the goal is disruption, 
                                  not if it is deterrence or incapacitation. But 
                                  how do you deter this enemy? The 9/11 attacks 
                                  and our subsequent experience fighting Islamic 
                                  insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq show that 
                                  many Muslim radicals are willing to die for 
                                  their cause. They are unlikely to be deterred 
                                  by a seventeen-year prison term. There is indeed 
                                  a trade-off between disruption and long-term 
                                  incapacitation, but Britain&#146;s failure to 
                                  stop the 7/7 bombers despite all that was known 
                                  about them shows that the value of disruption 
                                  should not be underestimated.</p>
                                <p>The <i>Terrorist Trial Report Card</i> also 
                                  asserts that there are now &#147;few, if any, 
                                  prevalent terrorist threats&#148; in the U.S. 
                                  While it may be true that policymakers overestimate 
                                  the domestic terrorist threat, the <i>Terrorist 
                                  Trial Report Card</i>&#146;s statistics prove 
                                  no such thing&#151;and, in fact, the report&#146;s 
                                  other conclusions undermine this finding. The 
                                  report concedes that the DOJ wants to win convictions 
                                  &#147;no matter how short the period of time 
                                  or how minor the charge&#148; and that DOJ &#147;is 
                                  focused on early detection rather than conviction 
                                  on federal terrorism charges.&#148; This applicable 
                                  prosecution model helps to explain both the 
                                  lack of proof in the courtroom of sleeper cells 
                                  with logistical or tactical links to al-Qaeda 
                                  and the reason that the majority of cases have 
                                  &#147;no link to terrorism once they go to court.&#148; 
                                  This phenomenon is entirely explainable by authorities&#146; 
                                  earlier disruption of plots.</p>
                                <p>Brian Michael Jenkins, senior advisor to the 
                                  president of the RAND Corporation, has noted 
                                  that &#147;suspects may be apprehended while 
                                  their plans are in the talking stage,&#148; 
                                  which makes prosecution difficult because suspects 
                                  &#147;can claim that they were only talking 
                                  and never had serious intentions.&#148;[<a href="#notes">139</a>] 
                                  The practical result is predictable:</p>
                                <blockquote>As a consequence, the number of prosecutions 
                                  is small compared with the number of people 
                                  detained, which reflects a preventive law enforcement 
                                  approach rather than the traditional reactive 
                                  approach. It is sufficient to say that the operational 
                                  capabilities of the jihadists have been degraded 
                                  and that terrorist operations are being thwarted. 
                                  Keeping score is difficult and irrelevant.[<a href="#notes">140</a>] 
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>Jenkins may overstate: perhaps keeping score 
                                  is not irrelevant, but it certainly is difficult. 
                                  It is clear, though, that the <i>Terrorist Trial 
                                  Report Card</i> does not come close to proving 
                                  a lack of jihadist threat inside the United 
                                  States. The only factor that the report considers 
                                  is what has been proved in the courtroom, which 
                                  is far from determinative. The fact that Al 
                                  Capone was only convicted of tax evasion doesn&#146;t 
                                  change the fact that he was a powerful and vicious 
                                  mobster: focusing only on the crime someone 
                                  was convicted of may obscure his actual activities. 
                                  Thus, premising future policy on the <i>Terrorist 
                                  Trial Report Card</i>&#146;s conclusion, as 
                                  the report urges, is a risky path to follow.</p>
                                <p>The value of the Al Capone model should thus 
                                  be apparent: it allows authorities to disrupt 
                                  terrorist activity before plots can become operational. 
                                  It is designed to succeed where other models, 
                                  such as the British model, would allow terrorists 
                                  to continue to operate.</p>

                                  <b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
                                <p>After the 9/11 attacks, the United States was 
                                  faced with an unprecedented challenge. Americans 
                                  learned how devastating a terrorist attack could 
                                  be, and there were fears that the next attack 
                                  could be even worse. An open society like the 
                                  United States has a number of inherent vulnerabilities, 
                                  and when 9/11 occurred, the government had little 
                                  information about other possible terrorist activity 
                                  inside the country. It was then that law enforcement 
                                  adopted the Al Capone model of fighting terrorism.</p>
                                <p>This paper examined five kinds of illegal activity 
                                  that terrorists have engaged in: drug trafficking, 
                                  financial scams, cyber-crime, illegal money 
                                  transfers, and immigration violations. Terrorists 
                                  gain many advantages from engaging in these 
                                  enterprises, advantages that range from raising 
                                  funds to posing a risk of a catastrophic cyber-terrorist 
                                  attack to entering the country in the first 
                                  place. And just as terrorists can gain from 
                                  their illegal activities, law enforcement can 
                                  exploit the crime-terror nexus by charging suspected 
                                  terrorists with lesser&#151;and easier to prove&#151;offenses 
                                  than involvement in a terrorist plot.</p>
                                <p>There are three principles that law enforcement 
                                  should adopt in trying to gain advantage in 
                                  this manner. First, law enforcement should have 
                                  a method of determining who is a possible terrorist 
                                  threat. One important element in this analysis 
                                  is terrorist associations that individuals or 
                                  organizations may have. <br>
                                  Second, law enforcement should be aware of the 
                                  kind of criminal enterprises that terrorists 
                                  have entered. For example, after the government 
                                  learned that terrorists were smuggling cigarettes 
                                  to raise money, more law enforcement resources 
                                  were devoted to combating that practice. It 
                                  is proper to devote more resources to an area 
                                  that has not just criminal, but also national, 
                                  security implications.</p>
                                <p>Third, law enforcement should continue to recognize 
                                  the value of using all available laws to combat 
                                  suspected terrorists. Modifications may be necessary; 
                                  for example, perhaps law enforcement should 
                                  wait longer before making arrests in some cases, 
                                  to maximize the intelligence that it gains. 
                                  But after 9/11, it was proper for authorities 
                                  to prosecute terrorists for the full range of 
                                  offenses that they committed. The value of disrupting 
                                  plots should not be underestimated. The difficulty 
                                  of prosecuting terrorist offenses increases 
                                  the importance of law enforcement using all 
                                  the tools at its disposal that are within the 
                                  law.</p>

                                  Some scholars have even suggested that the links 
                                  between terrorists and drug traffickers are 
                                  so prevalent that the two should not be dissociated. 
                                  However, Alison Jamieson has argued persuasively 
                                  to the contrary:</p>
                                  <blockquote>Organised crime and terrorism are correctly 
                                  viewed as quite distinct phenomena. Essentially, 
                                  the terrorist is a revolutionary, with clear 
                                  political objectives involving the overthrow 
                                  of a government or the status quo, and a set 
                                  of articulated strategies to achieve them. Organised 
                                  crime actors are inherently conservative: they 
                                  tend to resist political upheaval and seek conditions 
                                  of order and stability, those more conductive 
                                  to their business activities. Unlike terrorists, 
                                  who project an &#147;ideal state&#148; for which 
                                  they are prepared to sacrifice their lives, 
                                  organised crime sees no virtue in sacrifice, 
                                  has no comparable sense of &#147;victory&#148; 
                                  or &#147;defeat&#148;, but operates according 
                                  to a set of short- and medium-term goals to 
                                  be realised with maximum profit and minimum 
                                  risk.</blockquote>
                                  <p>In general, the organised criminal power system 
                                  is not &#147;anti-state&#148;, but a parallel 
                                  organisational model with its own legal and 
                                  ethical rules, hierarchy of authority and military 
                                  force. . . . Thus, unlike terrorist actors whose 
                                  raison d&#146;etre is direct confrontation with 
                                  the state against which they practice violence, 
                                  the survival of an organised crime group depends 
                                  upon operating within the state, on the penetration 
                                  by criminal actors of the legitimate political, 
                                  economic and social spheres.</p>

                                <li> Ahmidan was either transformed into a jihadist 
                                  in 2000 while in a Madrid detention center for 
                                  illegal aliens or during a later stint in prison. 
                                  A Spanish antiterrorism official has explained 
                                  that while in the detention center, Ahmidan 
                                  &#147;set himself up as an imam and told the 
                                  guards he would come back and kill them. No 
                                  one took him seriously then, but he already 
                                  had quite a following.&#148; Bruce Crumley &amp;

                                  analysis of money laundering in the United States 
                                  was released. See Money Laundering Threat Assessment

                                  thirteen money-laundering methods, including 
                                  bulk cash smuggling, trade-based money laundering,

                                  <p>The government ultimately dropped the prosecution 
                                    against al-Haramain corporation because neither 
                                    of the persons indicted was in the country 
                                    to stand trial. The defendants insisted that 
                                    the prosecution proceed against the shell 
                                    corporation while the two defendants were 
                                    safely overseas. The government&#146;s motion 
                                    to dismiss explains the prosecution&#146;s 
                                    decision to cease prosecution of the corporation:</p>
                                  <p>[I]t is the actions of the fugitive defendants 
                                    [Pirouz] Sedaghaty and [Soliman] Al-But&#146;he 
                                    which are at the core of the indictment. Those 
                                    actions are also the legal and factual basis 
                                    for AHIF [Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation], 
                                    Inc.&#146;s status as a defendant in the indictment. 
                                    Given the current state of affairs with respect 
                                    to AHIF, Inc. and the fugitive defendants 
                                    Sedaghaty and Al-But&#146;he, expending the 
                                    significant resources necessary to prosecute 
                                    the shell corporation would be inefficient 
                                    and wasteful, until at least one of the individual 
                                    defendants are apprehended. Moreover, even 
                                    were the government to prosecute the corporation, 
                                    a conviction without the presence of one of 
                                    the individual defendants would prove hollow. 
                                    The Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Inc. has 
                                    no currently available assets with which to 
                                    pay a fine, and the only existing responsible 
                                    corporate officers who could authorize the 
                                    payment of a fine, or ensure that the corporation 
                                    complies with any other type of remedial sanction 
                                    in conducting its future affairs, are fugitives 
                                    in the same criminal case. So, even were the 
                                    government to obtain a conviction against 
                                    the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Inc., 
                                    there is no one before the Court, or even 
                                    in the United States, who could truly represent 
                                    the corporate defendant. Expending the resources 
                                    of the Court and prosecution to obtain this 
                                    Pyrrhic victory would not be in the taxpayers&#146; 
                                    best interests.</p>
