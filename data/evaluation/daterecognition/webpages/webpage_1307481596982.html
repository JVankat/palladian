<h3><strong><a name="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION</strong> </h3>
<p>Axons are responsible for the transmission of information between different 
  points of the nervous system and their function is analogous to the wires that 
  connect different points in an electric circuit. However, this analogy cannot 
  be pushed very far. In an electrical circuit the wire maintains both ends at 
  the same electrical potential when it is a perfect conductor or it allows the 
  passage of an electron current when it has electrical resistance. As we will 
  see in these lectures, the axon, as it is part of a cell, separates its internal 
  medium from the external medium with the plasma membrane and the signal conducted 
  along the axon is a transient potential difference<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 
  that appears <em>across</em> this membrane. This potential difference, or <em>membrane 
  potential,</em> is the result of ionic gradients due to ionic concentration 
  differences across the membrane and it is modified by ionic flow that produces 
  ionic currents perpendicular to the membrane. These ionic currents give rise 
  in turn to longitudinal currents closing local ionic current circuits that allow 
  the regeneration of the membrane potential changes in a different region of 
  the axon. This process is a true propagation instead of the conduction phenomenon 
  occurring in wires. To understand this propagation we will study the electrical 
  properties of axons, which include a description of the electrical properties 
  of the membrane and how this membrane works in the cylindrical geometry of the 
  axon. </p>
<p>Much of our understanding of the ionic mechanisms responsible for the initiation 
  and propagation of the action potential (AP) comes from studies on the squid 
  giant axon by A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley in 1952. The giant axon has a diameter 
  in excess of 0.5 mm, allowing the introduction of electrodes and change of solutions 
  in the internal medium. These studies have general relevance because the properties 
  of the squid axon are very similar to non-myelinated nerves in other invertebrates 
  and vertebrates, including man. </p>
<h4><strong><a name="CandR"></a>The Capacitance and Resistance of the membrane</strong>. 
</h4>
<p>The plasma membrane is made of a molecular lipid bilayer. Inserted in this 
  bilayer, there are membrane proteins that have the important function of transporting 
  materials across the membrane. The lipid bilayer acts like an insulator separating 
  two conducting media: the external medium of the axon and the internal medium 
  or axoplasm. This geometry constitutes an electric capacitor<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 
  where the two conducting plates are the ionic media and the membrane is the 
  dielectric. The capacitance <em>c</em> of a capacitor increases with the area 
  of the plates and decreases with the separation between the plates according 
  to the the relation </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img.gif" width="781" height="74" align="baseline"><br>
  where <em>A</em> is the membrane area,<em> d</em> is the separation between 
  the plates or the membrane thickness and is the dielectric constant. In the 
  case of the membrane, it is more convenient to define the capacitance as independent 
  of the amount of area involved and call it the specific capacitance <em>C<sub>m</sub></em> 
  which is defined as the capacitance per unit area<em> or c/A</em>. Replacing 
  this definition in eq (1) we find </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img1.gif" width="781" height="59"><br>
  As the thickness <em>d</em> is only 25 A, the specific capacitance of the membrane 
  is very high, close to 1 �F/cm<sup>2</sup>. Having the properties of a capacitor, 
  the membrane is able to separate electric charge, achieved by a <em>difference</em> 
  in the number of anions and cations on each sideof the membrane; this charge 
  separation, in turn produces a potential difference across the membrane. In 
  a capacitor the potential difference <em>V</em> is related to the charge <em>Q 
  </em>by </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img2.gif" width="781" height="47"><br>
  where <em>C</em> is the capacitance. It is important to notice that in the case 
  of the plasma membrane a small amount of charge separation is able to generate 
  a large potential difference. For example, to obtain a membrane potential of 
  100 mV it is necessary to separate the product of <em>C<sub><font size="1">m</font></sub></em> 
  =1(�F/cm<sup>2</sup>) times <em>V<sub><font size="1">m</font> </sub></em>= 0.1 
  (Volts), that is, <em>Q</em>=0.1 �Coulombs/cm<sup>2</sup>.To get an idea of 
  the magnitude of this charge, we can compute the number<em> p</em> of monovalent 
  ions that must be separated across the membrane to explain this charge </p>
<p align="center"><em>p</em> = 0.1 x 10<sup>-6</sup> (coul/sq cm)/1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup> 
  (coul/ion) </p>
<p align="center">= 6.25 x 10<sup>11</sup> (ion/cm<sup>2</sup>) </p>
<p>which corresponds to only 6250 ions per �m<sup>2</sup> of membrane. </p>
<p align="left">The energy to put an ion into the lipid bilayer is so large that 
  we would expect the membrane to be practically impermeable to ions. However, 
  experimentally, it has been found that the membrane presents a finite permeability 
  to cations and anions. Today we know that this permeability is mediated through 
  specialized proteins that can act as carriers or channels for the passage of 
  charged species. The detail of the operation of channels will be described later 
  in this course. What is relevant here is the fact that ions can penetrate through 
  specialized pathways which constitute the membrane electrical <em>conductance</em> 
  (conductance is the reciprocal of resistance). This conductance will be another 
  element of our electric circuit that will represent the electrical characteristics 
  of the membrane.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="MED98fall.htg/img3.gif" width="781" height="565"> 
</p>
<p align="left">Again we will define units that are independent of the membrane 
  area. If we measure the electrical resistance of a membrane of 1 sq cm of surface 
  area, it will be 10 times larger than the resistance of a membrane with the 
  same characteristics but of 10 sq cm surface area. This is because the resistance 
  decreases as the access area increases. For this reason, we can define the membrane 
  specific resistance <em>R<sub><font size="1">m</font></sub></em> in units of 
  ohms sq cm or specific conductance <em>G<font size="1"><sub>m</sub></font></em> 
  in units of Siemens/cm<sup>2</sup> (S/cm<sup>2</sup>). </p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><a name="MembraneV"></a>The Membrane Potential.</font></p>
<h4><strong><a href="rp1.htm">The Nernst Potential</a></strong>
<p>How is it possible to separate charge across the membrane? Let us take a simple 
  example. Assume that we have a membrane separating two compartments (Fig. 1) 
  that has channels that are only permeable to potassium and no other ions can 
  permeate. Initially the channels are closed and we add 100 mM of KCl to the 
  lower compartment (say the interior of the cell) and 10 mM of KCl to the upper 
  compartment (the outside). As we have added a neutral salt, there will be the 
  same number of cations than anions in the lower compartment and the same will 
  be true for the upper compartment (even though the total number of ions is 10 
  times lower in the upper compartment).The consequence of the electroneutrality 
  in each side will be zero charge difference across the membrane and consequently 
  the membrane potential difference will be zero. This is because from eq. (3) 
  we can write that <em>V=Q/C,</em> where<em> V </em>is the potential difference 
  and <em>Q </em>is the excess charge. The permanent thermal motion of the ions 
  will make them move randomly but they will not be able to cross the membrane 
  because they are poorly permeant through the bilayer and the channels are closed. 
  Suppose that at one point we open the channels. Then, as there are 10 times 
  more K<sup>+</sup> ions in the bottom compartment than in the top compartment, 
  there will be 10 times more chances of an ion crossing up than down. This initial 
  situation is schematically pictured in Fig. 1A where a K<sup>+</sup> ion (the 
  black balls) is crossing the channel in the upward direction leaving a Cl<sup>-</sup> 
  ion behind. This flow, which is proportional to the concentration gradient, 
  increases the top compartment by one positive charge and the lower compartment 
  by one negative charge, producing a charge separation (Fig. 1B). This charge 
  separation introduces a non-random new electrostatic force acting on the ions, 
  as pictured in the box insets of Fig. 1. This electrostatic force tends to drive 
  the ions from the top compartment into the bottom compartment and at the same 
  time it tends to brake the flow in the opposite direction. The final result 
  is that the charge separation will build up a voltage across the membrane (<em>V=Q/C</em>) 
  that will continue to increase until the flow in both directions becomes equal 
  due to the increased electrostatic force that will tend to balance the flow 
  produced by the concentration gradient. When that happens, any ion that crosses 
  in one direction will be counterbalanced by another crossing in the opposite 
  direction, maintaining an equilibrium situation. This potential difference is 
  then called the <em>equilibrium potential</em> or Nernst potential. </p>
<p>The above discussion can be put in more quantitative terms by expressing the 
  net ion flow <em>j</em> in terms of the chemical and electrical gradients: </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img4.gif" width="735" height="78" align="baseline"><br>
  where<em> D </em>is the diffusion coefficient,<em> C </em>is the concentration, 
  <em>R </em>is the gas constant, <em>V </em>is the voltage,<em> z</em> is the 
  valence, <em>F</em> is the Faraday constant, and <em>T</em> is the temperature. 
  When <em>j</em>=0 (no net flow), eq (4) can be integrated and we get: </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img5.gif" width="769" height="78" align="baseline"><br>
  which is the Nernst equation that relates the voltage <em>V</em> across the 
  membrane which is in equilibrium with the concentration gradient established 
  by the concentrations <em>C<sub><font
size="1">o</font></sub></em><sub>, </sub>outside, and <em>C<sub><font size="1">i</font></sub></em>, 
  inside. It is customary to call this voltage the equilibrium potential of the 
  ion &quot;N&quot; <em>E<sub><font size="1">e</font></sub></em>, and by calling 
  the external and internal concentrations of the ion &quot;N&quot; N<sub><font size="1">o</font></sub> 
  and N<sub><font size="1">i</font></sub>, respectively we can rewrite eq. (5) 
  as follows: </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img6.gif" width="781" height="83"> </p>
<h4><strong>More than one specific channel</strong>. </h4>
<p>In the nerve membrane there are several types of channels, each of which is 
  selective to an specific ion, such as Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>. Therefore 
  the situation of zero net flow across the membrane does not depend on one particular 
  ion concentration gradient but it involves the concentration of the other permeant 
  ions and their relative permeabilities. In this situation we have to consider 
  the individual fluxes<em> j<font
size="1"><sub>N</sub></font></em><font
size="1"><sub>a</sub></font>,<em> j<sub><font size="1">K</font></sub></em>, etc. 
  and the solution when the sum of all the flows is zero gives the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz 
  equation which can be written as </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img7.gif" width="781" height="101" align="baseline"><br>
  where the permeabilities for the ion <em>k </em>is written as <em>P<sub>k</sub></em> 
  and the concentrations of the ion are given by its chemical symbol followed 
  by the subindex indicating the side of the membrane, with <em>i </em>for inside 
  and <em>o</em> for outside. Thus, according to this equation, the voltage across 
  the membrane is determined by the concentrations of all the ions and is most 
  affected by the ion with the highest permeability. If<em> E</em>, as computed 
  from eq. (7) is equal to the <em>E</em> of the Nernst equation (eq. 6) for one 
  particular ion, we say that that ion <strong>is in equilibrium</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Real channels are not perfectly selective.</strong> The selectivity 
  of ion channels is not perfect and, for example in K<sup>+</sup> channels, for 
  every 20 K<sup>+</sup> ions that flow through the channel, one Na<sup>+</sup> 
  ion can get through. This means that we cannot apply the Nernst equation to 
  compute the potential that produces zero flow across the channel because more 
  than one ion is involved. Instead, we could use the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation 
  (with <em>P<sub><font size="1">K</font></sub></em>/<em>P<sub><font
size="1">Na</font></sub></em>=20, in the case of the K channel) and the potential 
  predicted by the equation would be called <em>reversal potential</em>, instead 
  of equilibrium potential, at which the net flow of charge through the channel 
  is zero. . <br

<p align="left">We have now described the capacitance of the membrane, mainly 
  given by the bilayer, the resistance of the membrane given by the ionic channels, 
  and we must now include the <em>membrane potential</em>. As explained in the 
  previous paragraphs, this membrane potential exists even in the absence of stimulus 
  or external electric field due to the charge separation produced by the ion 
  redistribution under the influence of chemical and electrical gradients. In 
  resting conditions, this voltage is called the <em>resting potential</em> and 
  it can be represented as a battery that must be in serieswith the membrane resistance 
  (Fig. 2). This battery of electromotive force <a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a><em>E<sub><font

  may be considered as the equivalent electric circuit of the membrane of the

  systems of ionic channels each one with its own conductance <em>g<sub><font size="1">i</font></sub></em> 
  (where <em>g<sub>i</sub></em> =<em>1/R<sub><font size="1">i</font></sub></em>) 
  and reversal potential <em>E<sub><font size="1">i</font></sub></em>. Notice 
  that the battery is in <em>series</em> with the resistance which implies that 
  the membrane potential is equal to <em>E<font size="1"><sub>m</sub></font></em> 
  only when there is no current flow through the resistance <em>R<sub><font size="1">m</font></sub></em>, 
  that is, in open circuit conditions, or when it is measured electrometrically 
  (without draining current through the membrane). </p>

<p>The circuit in Fig. 2 is a minimal representation of the membrane. It is important 
  to note that this representation refers to a membrane element of very small 
  dimensions, such that the potential could be considered constant along each 
  side of the membrane. This is only true if the element is made infinitesimally 
  small bacause any finite size may not be isopotential due to the electrical 
  resistance of the medium and the geometry of the axon. As we will see below, 
  in the case of the axon we will have to locate this basic circuit of the membrane 
  element in the cylindrical geometry of the axon which will make the final circuit 
  quite complicated. But before incorporating the geometry, we can study the basic 
  properties of our elemental circuit which will be extremely useful in understanding 
  the electrical behavior of the elementary unit that constitutes the axonal membrane.

<h4><strong><a name="IonicCurrents"></a>Basic current equation through the conductive 
  pathways:</strong> </h4>
<p>The current through the conductive part of the membrane can be expressed as 
  a product of a conductance and a driving force: </p>
<p><img src="MED98fall.htg/img11.gif" width="775" height="37" align="baseline"><br>
  where <em>V-E<sub><font size="1">e</font></sub></em> is the driving force and<em>

  is the reversal potential for that pathway. If the pathway is selective to only 
  one ion species, <em>E<sub>e</sub></em> corresponds to the equilibrium potential 
  of that species <em>e</em> (the potential predicted by the Nernst equation). 
</p>
<p>There are several types of conductance and their classification is done according 
  to the type of channel involved. Thus, we have: Sodium, selective to Na; Potassium, 
  selective to K; Chloride, selective to Cl; Calcium, selective to Ca, etc. Currents

<p>This expression is similar to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation but it considers

  In several excitable membranes, such as the squid axon, <em>g<sub><font size="1">Cl</font></sub></em>

<p>In this section, we will study the currents through the different ionic pathways 
  and the resulting voltage across the membrane. The conventions will be that 
  the inside of the membrane faces down and all the voltages will be referred 
  to the outside. For example, if the membrane potential is -80 mV it means that 
  the inside is negative with respect to the outside. The variable conductances 
  (or variable resistances) are represented by a box with a side cursor (or arm) 
  that can slide up and down the side of the box (see Fig. 3). Thus, when the 
  cursor is close to the top the resistance between the two ends is minimum and 
  becomes maximum when the arm is close to the bottom (Fig. 3). The equilibrium 
  (or reversal) potentials are represented by batteries with the value written 
  near the battery symbol. In addition, the intensity of the current is represented 
  by the degree of shading of the wires, being black the highest intensity and 
  white zero current. The arrows indicate the direction of positive ions current 
  flow. </p>
<p>With these conventions, we can study the influence of the conductances and 
  reversal potentials in the final membrane potential in the steady state. </p>
<p><strong>First Case</strong>. Only one conductance is present (Figs 4A and 4B). 
  All the other conductances are zero (that is, resistances are infinite) represented 
  by an interruption in the connection of the variable resistor. This means that 
  there is no current circulation in any of the branches with infinite resistance. 
  This is represented in Fig. 4A for the case of finite K conductance and all 
  the others zero. Notice that the membrane potential will be equal to the K equilibrium 
  potential (in this case -73.3 mV) because there is no current circulation through 
  any other resistor and, since we are considering steady state, the capacitor 
  does not drain any current (we will study later the origin of capacitive current). 
  In Figure 4B there is a representation of the case when only the Na conductance 
  is present and all the others are zero. As expected, in this case the membrane 
  potential will be identical to the Na reversal potential, in this case +41.3 
  mV. The situation depicted in Fig. 4 is a rough approximation of what occurs 
  during an action potential: at resting the membrane is selective to K and the 
  membrane potential is near -73 mV and during the action potential the membrane 
  becomes selective to Na and the membrane potential reverses and becomes positive.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second Case </strong>(Figs. 5 and 6). Now we consider the more realistic 
  situation where all the conductances have a finite value, although different 
  among them. In the resting condition, the predominant conductance is potassium 
  as shown in Fig. 5. In the resting condition all the conductances are small 
  but the K conductance is larger than all the others. Notice that the relative 
  values of the conductances (in mS/sq cm) are <em>g<sub><font
size="1">K</font></sub></em>=0.37, <em>g<sub><font size="1">Na</font></sub></em>=0.02 
  and <em>g<sub><font
size="1">L</font></sub></em>=0.3. The K battery will drive an outward current 
  through the K conductance that will be drained by the leakage and Na branches 
  to make the total current equal zero. The resulting membrane potential will 
  be between the K reversal potential and Na reversal potential, but closer to 
  the <em>E<sub><font size="1">K</font></sub></em> because<em> g<sub><font size="1">K</font></sub></em> 
  is the largest conductance. Finally, let us consider the case when the Na conductance 
  predominates as during the rising phase of the action potential. In this case, 
  the actual sodium conductance increases several fold over the resting condition, 
  becoming the dominant conductance. This produces a large flow of inward current 
  through the Na conductance that is drained out by the K and leakage conductances 
  (see Fig. 6). </p>
<p>The <em>action potential is the result of changing the membrane from a K selective 
  condition to a Na selective condition.</em> We must explain now how this occurs. 
  To understand how these conductances shifts occur, we must study their ability 
  to change with the membrane voltage, or their &quot;voltage dependence&quot;.This 
  leads to a description of voltage dependent conductances. In voltage dependent 
  conductances the value of the conductance depends on the membrane potential.
