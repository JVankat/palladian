<strong><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8024550.stm">I'd been to Gary, Indiana before</a>. In April 2009, when the Obama fiscal stimulus had just begun, the city's mayor had told me that all the city needed was $400m of stimulus money in order to "fly like an eagle and make our country proud".</strong></p>

<p>To put this in context you have to know that Gary, home to what is still US Steel Corp's biggest plant, is suffering from one of the most advanced cases of urban blight in the developed world. Its city centre is near-deserted by day. The texture of the urban landscape is cracked stone, grass, crumbled brick and buddleia.</p>

<p>Gary is one third poor, 84% African American, and has seen its population halve over the past three decades. If crime, as the official figures suggest, has recently dropped off then - say the critics - that is because population flight from the city is bigger than the census figures show.</p>

<p>Gary in the end got $266m of stimulus money and has, according to the federal "<a href="http://www.recovery.gov/Transparency/RecipientReportedData/pages/RecipientReportedDataMap.aspx?State=IN&datasource=recipient">recipient reported data</a>" created a grand total of 327 jobs. That's $800,000 per job.</p>

<p>I went back determined to find out how the stimulus dollars had been spent; to get beyond the ideology and recriminations and see why President Barack Obama's stimulus has failed to turn the country around. </p>

<p>Because - if anywhere needs a stimulus it is Gary. If there were ever an easy win to be gained from state spending you would think it might be here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dtribby/sets/72157608831497490/">David Tribby</a>, professional photographer and son of a local steelworker, specialises in exploring urban decay. I persuaded Mr Tribby to take me into some of Gary's wrecked architectural masterpieces. </p>

<p>The striking thing is that they are all structurally dangerous and yet totally accessible. I did not have to cross a single piece of wire, tape or fencing to get in, nor did I encounter a security guard or dog patrol. The city seems to have given up even securing these ruins.</p>

<p><strong>Urban dereliction</strong></p>

<p>We toured the City Methodist Church - built in the 1920s with local stone. We stood on the once-sprung floor of the ballet studio in the Methodist School. We tramped through the remains of the post office, opened by Henry Morgenthau in 1936 as a New Deal reconstruction project, its wood-block floor coming apart; the peep-holes in the overhead walkway showing where Depression-era managers would check on the work-rate of the postal workers below. </p>

<div class="imgCaptionRight" style="float: right; ">
<img alt="" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/forsarah_11DSC_6274_226.jpg" width="226" height="200" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 10px 0 5px 20px;" /><p style="width:226px;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);margin-left:20px;"> </p></div>

<p>I sat on the back row of the Seaman Hall, its seats creaking dustily, and imagined the young steelworkers and their girlfriends in the 1950s, playing Big Daddy and Maggie the Cat in an am-dram production of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, whose playbill is still peeling off the stage door amid the crumbling stonework of the proscenium arch.</p>

<p>I stood where Frank Sinatra stood on the day he came to Gary in 1945. </p>

<p>It was a feisty occasion because hundreds of white Gary school kids had gone on strike against the right of black kids to swim one day a week in the same swimming pool, and share the instruments in the band room.</p>

<p>Ol' Blue Eyes cancelled a $10,000 gig, rushed to the Gary Memorial Auditorium, told the audience this was the most shameful event in the history of education, warned them he could "lick any S.O.B in the room" and then sang. </p>

<p>He did not, <a href="http://vodpod.com/watch/1904199-frank-sinatra-the-house-i-live-in">as in this 1945 propaganda film </a>accuse them of being no better than a bunch of Nazis, but he did sing the song from that film - "The House I Live In" - a schmaltzy paean to what were then seen as core American values: religious tolerance and anti-racism. It was a film that would win Sinatra an Oscar, shortly followed, as the political climate changed, by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist">hounding</a> from Senator Joe McCarthy.</p>

<p>What Sinatra fought against, three decades of industrial decline managed to complete. There has been "white flight" from Gary. More precisely there has been "middle class flight" - ie the salariat, including many of the steelworkers, has moved out, or moved into landscaped and patrolled communities on the edge of town.</p>

<p><strong>Brink of bankruptcy?</strong></p>

<p>So what's the story with Gary and the stimulus? The mayor believes the city is "last in line" when it comes to federal money - because the money is dispensed via the state of Indiana, which is Republican controlled. Mayor Rudy Clay tells me:</p>

<p><em>"I guess they thought, well, Gary voted in large numbers for the president, enabling him to take the state of Indiana, so he will look after them."</em></p>

<p>But it is more complex - Gary's public finances are a mess. It owes tens of millions of dollars to other entities. Its great get-out-of-jail card - tax revenue from casinos - turned out to be a busted flush. Its convention centre is dark most of the time. The one-time Sheraton Hotel, right next to the City Hall, is derelict.</p>

<p>With no ability to raise a local income tax it is reliant on property tax. But the State of Indiana passed laws capping tax raising powers, so by 2012 Gary's tax income from property will halve. </p>

<p>At that point, according to the <a href="http://www.in.gov/dlgf/files/Fiscal_Monitor_Report_12-09.pdf">fiscal monitor appointed by the city</a>, it will lack the revenue to fund even its police, fire and ambulance services. The monitor calls for much of the rest of Gary's services to be privatised - but as city officials point out, once privatised they cannot enforce job guarantees that allow the city to employ local people. Says the monitor, bluntly:</p>

<p><em>"The city will simply have to give up some long-standing - and often important - services that are the responsibility of other governments, even when it is likely that those governments will not provide the same level of service."<br />
</em><br />
In summary, Gary is about two years away from bankruptcy and is being forced to cut taxes and cut spending even as the federal government tries to pump money through. </p>

<p>In this context, with the stimulus money not available to fix the core financial problem, the results were always going to be patchy. </p>

<p>In the event the stimulus dollars have mainly gone to a one-off schools re-organisation project - you can see some of the results of that in my report tonight - and to street renovation, and beefing up the arsenal of the local police. Gary's police have to combine <em>The Wire</em> style policing with a kind of armed social work amid a Gary's night-time chaos of "recreational shooting" and domestic disputes.</p>

<p><strong>Philosophical divide</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9079654.stm">When I speak to the Republican governor of Indiana, Mitch Daniels, about Gary's plight, he is blunt</a>. He blames Congress for micromanagement of where the stimulus could be spent. Could nothing more have been done?</p>

<p><em>"If there been more flexibility about the funds [from the US Congress], it could have, but I think it's important to be charitable here - Gary has been a disaster for many, many years. It is a tragedy what has occurred there and in some other cities here in the US. There wasn't going to be an immediate turn around, no matter how many borrowed dollars you showered on the place. " <br />
</em></p>

<div class="imgCaptionRight" style="float: right; ">
<img alt="" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/bbcmitchdaniels226.jpg" width="226" height="200" class="mt-image-right" style="margin: 10px 0 5px 20px;" /><p style="width:226px;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);margin-left:20px;"> </p></div>

<p>But, how can you enforce fiscal austerity on a place like Gary, at the same time as the official policy of the federal government is to reflate the economy? Surely, I ask Mr Daniels, something has to give? He says:</p>

<p><em>"Gary's the most extreme case that you could find in our state, but there are many others that are a lesser version of that same story, and as I say to those communities - their leaders - all the time: people aren't leaving here because you didn't tax them enough, because you didn't spend enough money on this or that public service - they left because you taxed them too much or you simply did not create the conditions for a private sector to flourish."<br />
</em><br />
And that brings you right back up against the philosophical divide in American politics. </p>

<p>Large parts of the Indiana population believe all taxpayer dollars spent on Gary are wasted. Some Republican candidates in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10263956">the 2 November election</a> are standing on the explicit message that there has been no positive impact at all from the stimulus. </p>

<p>Whereas in Europe, and even parts of Asia, the national government would have taken charge of vectoring regeneration money to a place like Gary, the US does not seem in a mood to do public regeneration.</p>

<p><strong>Uncertain future</strong></p>

<p>Gary's city officials are well aware that there are templates for resurrecting their city, and they've got the basic first steps defined - demolishing 3,000 derelict homes, installing new street lights. The stimulus money applied for in each case has been slow in coming and less than asked for. Beyond the ideology, the American public sector seems very poorly geared to spending money, full stop, despite being in charge of quite a lot of it.</p>

<p>Gary's uncertain future fascinates economists and urban planning experts - along with cities like Detroit and Flint in Michigan it is in danger of just being reclaimed by nature. One of the black community leaders I met in Gary was passionately advocating that they simply raze whole blocks to the ground and set up urban farms.</p>

<p>When you go into the wreck of the Palace Theatre on Gary's Broadway - just across from the wreck of VJ Records, which released the Beatles' first ever single in the US - you get a sense of the splendour of an industrial community at its height. </p>

<p>When it opened, the theatre - like so much of Gary's architecture, built in the "Mission Revival" style - contained blue fountains and crushed velvet, each seat arm moulded into a Moroccan-style arch. </p>

<p>In the orchestra pit there is a squashed grand piano, made in Chicago by Adam Schaff, surely the original one installed there in 1927. I banged its grime encrusted keys and discovered to my astonishment that, amid the clunks and groans, a clear D-sharp three octaves above Middle C.</p>

<p>It took just a single century for Gary to rise and fall. Its people still carry that relaxed pride you find in black communities across the industrial mid-West. It's a developed and quite mature urban culture - where everybody seems to know each other, an edgy community but not really a broken one, despite the night-time drug and gun antics of some young men. Go into the schools and you can feel that its spirit is not broken. What is broken is the landscape.</p>

<p>If it is ever one day fixed we will know that America has found a way to cope with the urban collapse that comes with industrial decline. Conversely Gary may be just the first leafy oasis of a post-industrial dystopia that awaits, maybe a century down the line.</p>

The fundamental issue is being swept under the carpet not proactively assessed and dealt with like an engineer would analyse a problem and develop asolution.<BR /><BR />If it were down to me I would be looking to try to create a system where generally people worked less and that communities have a certain ammount of in-built sustainability which provides abaseline maintenece and food production role for those whom may never be able to get 'jobs' in the current economic model sense. It would work something like a Kibbutz for baseline human needs with everyone contributing, but that would not detract from inventing and trading new products and services as well for those suitable gifted and trained to act in that kind of sphere.<BR /><BR />Such a society would provide a base level sense of self worth and value to society without (hopefully) compromising the excitement that comes with a capitalist dynamic. You could call it sustainable capitalism or intelligent capatalism or managed capitalism if you like.<BR /><BR />From an engineers perspective such a system looks like it would go some way to address the issues of our time, in part brought about by our own sucess as a species.<BR /><BR />The continual frustration for me is that it seems so obvious and so right as an approach but you will not find it expressed as amainstream media view anyway. The whole debate is dominated by media, political and financial leverage which is sucessfully by-passing democracy by what amounts to , essentially, a policy of mis-information to maintain the status quo.<BR /><BR />It is all so very very frustrating, pointless and contributes massively to the burden of unecesarry human suffering.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_239349"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101763234&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101763449"> <span class="comments_comment_number">3.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment3" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101763449#comment_101763449">13:21pm</a> on 12th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=5056328" class="comment_username_235597">duvinrouge</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Fascinating - good journalism.<BR /><BR />Barbarism is coming fast!</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_235597"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101763449&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101764307"> <span class="comments_comment_number">4.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment4" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101764307#comment_101764307">13:37pm</a> on 12th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=14199772" class="comment_username_233551">jauntycyclist</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>..If it is ever one day fixed we will know that America has found a way to cope with the urban collapse that comes with industrial decline..<BR /><BR />caused by which country and its currency manipulation?<BR /><BR />the assumption here is that 'market forces' are at work rather than China's marxist nationalist economic warfare.<BR /><BR />the chinses currency should be the strongest in the world and the usa and gb among the weakest. so jobs should be flooding into the the usa and uk but its not because china keeps its currency weaker than usd and gbp.<BR /><BR />In the same way some see crime in terms of failure of law some [usually on the left] see currency manipulation in terms of the 'failure of capitalism'.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_233551"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101764307&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101769146"> <span class="comments_comment_number">5.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment5" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101769146#comment_101769146">15:12pm</a> on 12th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=5056328" class="comment_username_235597">duvinrouge</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>#2 Jericoa<BR /><BR />"If it were down to me I would be looking to try to create a system where generally people worked less and that communities have a certain ammount of in-built sustainability...Such a society would provide a base level sense of self worth and value to society without (hopefully) compromising the excitement that comes with a capitalist dynamic."<BR /><BR />Doesn't an analysis of capitalism show that only one value matters - the value of money?<BR />Capitalism is all about accumulation - growth for the sake of growth - money making more money.<BR />It is fundamentally at odds with nature &amp;

China has a managed Planned Economy, the USA has a libertarian, free-market economy. They are on the same planet, but they operate with different Constitutions. You have to look at each system from within it's own system and not look at each in terms of each other. Each consider themselves democracies.<BR /><BR />Look up Uderdetermination of Theory by Evidence, it's one of the Three Indeterminacies. This is a matter of mathematical logic and language, which you can not get around. Whilst you are at it, look up Ontological Relativity. To bring that down to earth with a a bump, try to understand that you can generate the same low level code from more than one high level language. You are doing so now as you write comments. China manages its population and its government has a primary duty to its people, not the rest of the world or to shareholders (who could be anywhere in the USA given the NYSE etc). If US companies don't want goods from China and don't want to set up factories in China, it does not have to. It is Americans who have done this, to enrich a minority. <BR /><BR />They only care about the other Americans as consumers.

Gary was not bombed.<BR /><BR />Secondly, if one were to inject a stimulus into say Lagos, would its economy pick up? Would law and order improve? If so, why haven't lots of companies done exactly that to make use of the readily available labour (Nigeria like Bangladesh and Pakistan have become three times the size of the UK population in just the last half century). Note, at the same time, the UK population would have been obviously shrinking were it not for our immigrants.<BR /><BR />Thirdly, you appear to have missed a crucial part of what Paul wrote:<BR /><BR /><i>"Gary in the end got $266m of stimulus money and has, according to the federal "recipient reported data" created a grand total of 327 jobs. <BR />That's $800,000 per job.<BR /><BR />I went back determined to find out how the stimulus dollars had been spent; to get beyond the ideology and recriminations and see why President Barack Obama's stimulus has failed to turn the country around.<BR /><BR />Because - if anywhere needs a stimulus it is Gary. If there were ever an easy win to be gained from state spending you would think it might be here."</i><BR /><BR />If one looks at the ETS video listed, one should begin to see where the problems lie. For that to work though, one has to abandon some cherished assumptions about how plastic people are in response to environmental stimuli. THAT I suggest is a prejudice which most of us since the end of WWII have never adequately questioned. When more do, a lot is going to change. Until we do, it will, I suggest just keep getting worse like a very slow train wreck.<BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_3706369"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101779329&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101781117"> <span class="comments_comment_number">13.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment13" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101781117#comment_101781117">19:42pm</a> on 12th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=14411025" class="comment_username_1965037">Jessica MacGilvray</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p> A world run for profit results in a world not worth living in.

No. What you need to grasp is that ETS has been responsible for most of the <b>national</b> testing in the USA since the 1940s. They should, I suggest, be seen as the monitors of the nation's (genetic) abilities. The NAEP for instance is known a The National Report Card. <BR /><BR />What ETS found most remarkable was that despite this all being well known in the profession, most people just still don't get what's going on. Why might that be do you think?

So what?<BR /><BR />Let me tell you why "white flight" occurs.<BR /><BR />My cousin was a mild-mannered boy and grew up to be a mild-mannered man.  As his Chicago neighborhood became more and more black, he started getting beaten up by the new residents.  Eventually his parents moved away because they were afraid he would be permanently injured.  They had to sell their house for much less than it was worth just a few years before; no one wanted to be the last white family to leave and black families would not / could not offer much money.  Many of my relatives and friends lost money on their houses in this manner and I'm not talking about 10-20% losses.<BR /><BR />A white teenaged girl I know got lost driving in the south side of Chicago.  A police car actually drove up behind her and told her via the loudspeaker to leave the neighborhood.<BR /><BR />A woman I know was driving down a major street in the south side of Chicago.  At a stoplight, a few black boys brazenly entered her car and demanded to be taken to a specific address.  Luckily for her, all they wanted was a ride.  After that, we all locked our doors while driving in Chicago.<BR /><BR />I could go on and on, but I suspect the general mood here is too liberal to listen.<BR /><BR />P.S. Yes, the Jackson family hails from Gary.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_1526535"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101788641&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101788714"> <span class="comments_comment_number">29.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment29" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101788714#comment_101788714">22:41pm</a> on 12th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13744443" class="comment_username_239349">Jericoa</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p> #7 Shireblogger<BR /><BR />Interesting and unexpected snippet of information that which I will look into once I am free from my own leveraged gross capitalist system (i.e the company I work for) tomorrow, as it happens. looking forward to it actually.<BR /><BR />To 'raze blocks and turn them into urban farms'' is definitely an option that should be actively pursued with stimulus money, it is far more likely to leave a positive legacy than ' digging a hole in the road so you can pay someone to fill it in again' .

I have black and white neighbors. I witnessed the racism and white flight of the late 60's and 70's and it was devastating. However the decline of Gary is mainly due to the massive loss of jobs at US Steel due to computerization and mechanization, and the loss of property tax revenue when the state revised the method of property tax calculation. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the tax bills of major companies like US Steel and BP Amoco. Governor Daniels is correct that Gary has always suffered from massive corruption in local government, and he has refused to help Gary in any way because of this. I don't find this to be a realistic approach to our problems.<BR />In any case I thank the presenter for pointing out that the city may go bankrupt in two years, that is a timeline I had not heard before.

Focusing on and distortion problems in the US allow you to divert attention from your own and to help you cope with areas of inferiority that you want to pretend you don't have with regards to how you compare to America.<BR /><BR />For that purpose you will a) exaggerate problems in the US and b) create larger, baseless political conclusions from them in order to add to a narrative you've been hearing that you want to be true but really is not.<BR /><BR />Gary Indiana is not by any stretch of the imagination status quo for the US. It's an anomaly. It's the worst possible case that exists in all of the US and to say that it can be used as a symbol for the entire US is completely absurd. The way that Brits and mainland Europeans fiendishly obsess about places like Gary, Indiana is pretty hilarious. It's just another example of how ant-Americanism is almost always, always based on focusing criticizing the US to the exclusion of any sort of self-criticism. <BR /><BR />Europe is not fairing better than the US. There several instances of former industrial urban areas seeing population decline throughout Europe, including the UK, especially the north of England. I've been to Liverpool and I saw more derelict buildings there than I have in any city I've been to in the US. The European economy is not outperforming the US, but European media is certainly dedicated to creating the illusion that it is, despite the fact that unemployment is higher in the Eurozone than it is in the US. The Eurozone sans Germany was harder hit by recession, declining more and recovering less than the US has thus far. Every single major European government actually has a higher debt relative to GDP than the US does, as shocking as that may seem. European governments are making massive cuts in expenditures, which have provoked riots.<BR /><BR />But hey, everyone. Look at America instead. It's more comfortable that way. </p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_1607901"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101790326&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101790526"> <span class="comments_comment_number">37.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment37" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101790526#comment_101790526">06:49am</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=5056328" class="comment_username_235597">duvinrouge</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>#23 Sasha Clarkson<BR /><BR />You are clearly a very community minded person who cares about the world we live in.<BR />There are many good people in the Green Party, such as Caroline Lucas.<BR /><BR />Perhaps once you have an active local branch you may want to set up a local social forum bringing together all those who want another world where people &amp; the planet come before profit.<BR /><BR />Best of luck.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_235597"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101790526&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101792050"> <span class="comments_comment_number">38.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment38" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101792050#comment_101792050">09:39am</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=2347429" class="comment_username_139150">stanilic</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>30 <BR /><BR />Hullo, Debt Juggler.<BR /><BR />I see you have been spending some time honing your man-management skills.<BR /><BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_139150"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101792050&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101792391"> <span class="comments_comment_number">39.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment39" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101792391#comment_101792391">09:48am</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=2347429" class="comment_username_139150">stanilic</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>27 tabblenabble01<BR /><BR />I must apologise for not spending my life glued to the television.

It’s a solution does not work because the private sector has to produce goods that people want. If people can’t afford or don’t want these goods, the sector does not create new jobs, there is no extra money in people’s pocket, hence the cycle starts all over again.

Grand Rapids is in the midst of a cultural renaissance driven by the energy of local business leaders who refused to allow their town to die.  These people believe in local reinvestment.  Moreover, unlike Flint, Detroit and Gary, Grand Rapids was never dominated by concentrations of heavy industry such as steel or automobiles.  While we had our share of General Motors factories, their closure did not signal the end for us.  The US is still a place of great dynamism and inventiveness.  It is now in the process of reinventing itself according to a capitalist model, albeit one that must be willing to rein in its worst impulses.

One (research) is about building and testing, the other is about construction and destruction with words alone.

Perhaps there is acreeping recognition that the States really will have to re-invent itself in a radical way and that will mean being somewhat less of an influence on the world stage for a while until the spirit of 'Grand Rapids Mitchigan' can prevail again.<BR /><BR />I also note that some of our friends accross the pond have taken offense at the journalistic approach and some of the comments on here.<BR /><BR />I for one am not 'anti American' nor do I revel in Americas current serious problems, nor do I pretend that things are any better here.<BR /><BR />#36 in particular, if you trace back comments on here and past articles you will see that we tend to be much more critical of our own economic state of affairs and politics ( UK and the broader Europe included) as we are of the USA.<BR /><BR />American positivism is a good thing generally, and we could do with some of that over here for sure, equally, sometimes, it is important to be critical of oneself  and take along hard honest look at your situation and recent behaviour on the global stage. It needs abit of humility to do that, I think in my humble opinion, that the USA would benefit from that kind of introspection and in so doing turn this around in apositive way before the humiliation part happens anyway. A little bit of humility now in the US would go along way to avoid a worse future scenario.<BR /><BR />The question is are nations (and I dont just include the US in this) mature enough in behaviour to avoid the current crisis escalating into a full blown currency war. <BR /><BR />Compromises are available for all, but they can only start from amutaul position of humility. The more drum banging that goes on the less positive the outcome for all is likely to be. Free market capitalism at l;east as embodied by the US (and here) has been shown to have grave failings and needs a radical overhaul.

Even accepting that there are between-group differences in sets of characteristics, which is nothing to get excited about, judging an individual of one group by the average of the group that they come from is not just irrational prejudice, it “would be treated as professional incompetence in many areas of human endeavour”. <BR /><BR />“Look through the internet for special interest groups other the KKK, you will find black groups, Jewish groups, Chinese groups etc. What is frowned upon is White groups.” Ignoring for a moment that most Jewish people I know are white, perhaps some of these groups share a common special interest? Perhaps historical persecution by “white groups”? Whatever “white groups” might mean.<BR /><BR />@Kent and Saucymugwump, don’t be so defensive. Paul’s one of the rare journos who makes no attempt to sensationalise. I can’t recall Paul stating anywhere in the report that Gary was representative of America. Paul was pretty upfront in saying that it was an extreme case, and if you had seen or recalled any of Paul’s reports from the North West of England earlier in the year then you might change your mind about this more recent report being about bashing America. Pretty much the same thing as is happening in Gary is happening in Burnley, Stoke, Wigan, and Middlesborough and Sunderland in the North East. And like you say, in many other places in Europe. <BR />And I agree with you totally about The Guardian. The British press in general is almost unreadable, that’s why News Night is a breath of fresh air. And you don’t even need to read to enjoy it, so perfect for you septics.<BR /><BR />But just to pick up on your Piccadilly anecdote. 1) London is not Britain; 2) not many people crossing at Piccadilly Circus could be called locals, most are drifts of tourists; and 3) “I guess Brits never think about whether someone they know is in the ambulance”: surely in a decent society you would make way for an ambulance whether you thought someone you knew was in it or not. There are plenty of lamentable acts of antisocial behaviour in every city in every country, but occasionally people’s humanity does shine through. The tales of self-sacrifice during the aftermath of the 7/7 bombings in London being a good example. <BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_5220985"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101807593&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101807646"> <span class="comments_comment_number">59.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment59" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101807646#comment_101807646">14:53pm</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=14427365" class="comment_username_2100479">_SiD_</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Wonderful and depressing and shocking all in the same measure.

Most of my peers who has family in Gary but who have escaped the grips of that city we laugh at our past, and at the present situation. The beauty that Gary once possesed, explained to me by my parents has now faded away. And all I've seen is the ugliness, the abandoned buildings, the gunshots that I became used to as a child. The broken glass and numerous amounts of drug addicts that were as common to me as the sunrise. It desensitized me. I laughed at Gary, but now it almost brings me to tears.

And black racism toward white people was a major factor in Gary, Detroit, Atlanta, Memphis and many other cities.  Another factor ignored was the effect all that anti-white rhetoric had on business.  Shipping manufacturing and industrial jobs overseas became a no-brainer when they considered that there would be no productivity losses blamed on racial issues.  Since 2000 more than 42,000 factories have been carted up and shipped out of the country which displaced around 15 million American workers.  EVERYONE who fans racist flames in ANY direction can be blamed for this.  The business world wants to rise above this crap.  And so they have.  Nobody even hints at corporate racism when the bulk of the work is done outside of America.  The fact that Obama is president and not working on a farm is certain proof that America has indeed come a very long way since the 50s.

The only alternative is to just abandon the city altogether and offer to rehouse its suffering inhabitants elsewhere.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_5189217"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101819194&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101819405"> <span class="comments_comment_number">75.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment75" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101819405#comment_101819405">19:10pm</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13313734" class="comment_username_262043">Sasha Clarkson</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>@34 I've edited and re-uploaded the two Alex Glasgow songs:<BR /><BR /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B96qKs4-EI8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B96qKs4-EI8</a><BR /><BR /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGPSqE74F0Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGPSqE74F0Q</a></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_262043"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101819405&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101819464"> <span class="comments_comment_number">76.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment76" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101819464#comment_101819464">19:12pm</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=14427365" class="comment_username_2100479">_SiD_</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p> #65 -"You just proved that you have never traveled in the USA and that you are willing to accept any story that reinforces your established bias."<BR /><BR />"We have been sold down the river by corrupt politicians and greedy capitalists."<BR /><BR />Admittedly I haven't travelled extensively in the USA, mostly on the East Coast.

In addition, I have traveled to most of the states.  One of the few places I have not visited is NYC; bed bugs are something I can do without.  I have never seen the aforementioned behavior anywhere except London.  In the Midwest, many people almost run into each other trying to get out of the way of ambulances.  At the risk of generalizing, perhaps certain large cities contain large numbers of selfish numbskulls.<BR /><BR />Years before 9/11, there was the creation of the "I love NY" campaign, with "love" represented by a red heart.  In response, in Denver we had bumper stickers that read "If you love NY, take I-70 east."  For those of you who do not retain a map of the Interstate Highway System in your head, I-70 is a major east-west highway running through the center of the USA.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_1526535"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101823802&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101824101"> <span class="comments_comment_number">82.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment82" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101824101#comment_101824101">21:21pm</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=14647859" class="comment_username_5230809">pginflag</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p> My parents were born in Gary and remember their teenage years during the "hay day" you refer to fondly.

There is a fair amount of derelection concentrated in the back to back housing areas, deserted by people preferring greener neighbourhoods, but the city centre is thriving while Gary`s or Detroit`s are almost dead. The central district is protected by Unesco as a world historic area. The number of skyscraper and apartment buildings built and regenerated in the last decade in Liverpool is stunning. The new shopping quarter, L1, costed 1 bn pounds and is visited by over 30 million people every year. It is almost 100% full and provides for thousands of jobs. The local John Lennon Airport is thriving, the port is planning massive expansion and the three local unis are bursting at the seams, concentrating almost 60.000 students from all over the world. The city is got a world class new arena and conference centre by the Mersey. Liverpool is a world famous brand name. The number of people living there is increasing. Even the car manufacturing industry, represented by Vauxhall-GM and Jaguar Land Rover is growing these days. The city has been through some difficult times but has been helped by the public sector and is getting back on her feet again. Americans, public money is not panacea but neither is private investment. One has to know how best they can combine to get the required result. Liverpool is a beacon for depression infected american cities.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_5230941"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101824983&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101824987"> <span class="comments_comment_number">85.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment85" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101824987#comment_101824987">21:48pm</a> on 13th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=3688838" class="comment_username_1030857">SONICBOOMER</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p> Paul, incisive reporting as usual, thanks.<BR /><BR />Kent, if you think this serious, detailed reporting is such a threat to your self esteem, I suggest it's YOU with the problem - or just too used to the shrieking, fact free emoting of FOX?<BR /><BR />Why would any sane person find pleasure in this economic crisis and it's effects?<BR />Face it, greedy, under-regulated bankers and their shills on Capitol Hill did what Bin Laden failed to do with his attacks in 2001 - cause a Western economic meltdown.<BR />(And the US I used to admire - men on the Moon in 8 years, the WW2 'Arsenal Of Democracy etc, would have re-built those towers bigger and better and done it fast - not engage in nasty, bigoted racism about some minor centre somewhere near the (still) construction site.

I know because I grew up in - and moved away from - Gary. <BR />This paints a picture that Gary was some utopia gone wrong - it wasn't. From the beginning it was a gold rush boom town and you can find these ghost towns all over America as the gold (steel mill jobs) dried up and the people moved on. No one in the US assumes the demise of Tombstone Arizona represents a "decline" of civilization as a whole and neither does Gary, Indiana. <BR />Gary was formed as a "company town" to fuel the new steel mills and, as the forces of capitalism often do, another company found a better location, cheaper manufacturing, access to labor, etc. and the company relocated. Just as the auto industry it supplied has relocated to Kentucky, Pennsylvania and even California, so the steel industry has decentralized. If anything, it is a text book example of capitalism in action.  <BR />As this report points out the decline in Gary started 40 years ago. 18 months and $266m was never expected to magically turn it into Disneyland. At best it was expected to provide enough police to supervise the last few people that don't have enough money to leave. On that measure I think this report shows some success.<BR />Yeah, whats left of the town is a cesspool but it certainly isn't and example of the decline of western civilization or the failure of a current government policy.

I am in process of creating what I am calling the GTTC, or Garts Time Transition Center to house re-entry level residents and provide the critical education needed to help the folks learn that picking up a hammer instead of a gun is a much better deal.

The BBC is carrying stories from the UK and Germany today, and earlier in the week from Holland, all based upon the fear of the same basic premise as the 'Gary Indiana' experience of ethnic replacement or dislocation. <BR /><BR />In all these countries there are mass relocation's being undertaken in some cities, including emigration, but it's not discussed because of the outright fear of being 'labelled' for talking about a real issue. I expect that we will continue along our current path with, as one of today's BBC UK stories describes it, 'some of the most "reckless and unpopular" government policies in generations' until the inevitable occurs, but by then its way to late.   <BR /><BR /><BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_1364151"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101841186&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_101845096"> <span class="comments_comment_number">97.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment97" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?postId=101845096#comment_101845096">14:46pm</a> on 14th Oct 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=14647673" class="comment_username_5229259">jay-1975</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p> Al in SoCal, the solution is simple, raze the town and replace it with something new.

The Mayor of Gary earns $150,000+ and is constantly crying how poor he is. You can imagine how well this is received in the state capitol. Even the Democrat controlled lower house is not fond of Gary. <BR /><BR />Gary has large income flows from casino gaming, the remaining steel mills on Lake Michigan, and other reliable income. They get approximately $60M in taxes to run his city. The problem is that they want to spend $80M. Last year's fiscal audit of the 2008 books noted that Gary runs on a cash accounting basis and that there were large chunks of money that nobody could account for. Cash accounting is fine for a hot dog stand, not a major city. The problems with how they spend their money ran over 150 pages. <BR /><BR />This year they've finally instituted modern accounting but didn't quite sweep all the dirty laundry under the rug. They openly reported in June that in 2009, the city directly contributed $1,300 to Democrat party organizations, a major no-no. The accountants were so astonished at all the other improper giving that they actually didn't notice. <BR /><BR />Oh, and the 100,000 population? It's a fiction, 10 year old numbers from the 2000 census.

It is true that the urban decline is horrific, but it's not clear that after the war years the economy could ever have supported a grand city so near to Chicago.  Even in the 60s there was not a sufficient audience to fill the Memorial Auditorium (which was, I believe a gift from US Steel, like much of the early infrastructure). The relatively prosperous surrounding community is only prosperous relatively.  The big money that results from making steel  has always kept its distance,  and is no longer interested in paternalistic gestures to the people who tend those mills.<BR /><BR />But back to my week back home.   You didn't have time to show us the natural beauty that underlies the ruin. There are miles of sandy beaches, and dunes populated by unique flora along the Lake Michigan shore.  Much of the east side is now a national park.  I rented a beach house (yes, within Gary city limits)and woke to the sun rising over the water (and yes, over the steel mills to the east), deer grazing in front of the house, monarch butterflies drifting through milkweed, water birds of all descriptions, red shouldered hawks, humming bird quarrels.  The sunsets magnify the clearly visible Chicago skyline across the lake in the evening.  and no, I did not feel threatened at all.  It was beautiful, and the sound of the freight trains and the immovable bulwarks of the mills on the shore made it all the moreso.<BR /><BR />I agree with the activist who suggested simply razing the unused buildings.  Too much has been unsuccessfully spent trying to restore a Gary that never really became what it tried to be. I saw with my own eyes that nature can make a swift comeback there.  Let's accept a smaller community  and let's get behind those kids that we saw in your excellent documenatary working  to create beauty, and lives for themselves.   Given a few tools, which surely we can afford, perhaps they can create an environment worth staying for, as well as coming back to. <BR /><BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_5248933"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog140/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=101877159&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>    </ul>  <div class="ieclear">&nbsp;</div>   <div class="comments_pagination"> <div id="comment_pagination_page_status"> <p>Page 1 of 2</p> </div> <ul class="comments_pagination_ul">  <li class="comment_pagination_first_page_inactive">First </li>     <li class="comment_pagination_current_page">1 </li>    <li class="comment_pagination_pages"><a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?module=comments&controller=index&action=index&siteName=blog140&forumId=movabletype140_264252&title=Gary%2C+Indiana%3A+Unbroken+spirit+amid+the+ruins+of+the+20th+Century&limit=100&listNamespace=movabletype140&parentUri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fblogs%2Fnewsnight%2Fpaulmason%2F2010%2F10%2Fgary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html&filter=&preset=blog&postStyle=richtext&comments_page=2#dna-comments">2</a> </li>     <li class="comment_pagination_last_page_active"><a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html?module=comments&controller=index&action=index&siteName=blog140&forumId=movabletype140_264252&title=Gary%2C+Indiana%3A+Unbroken+spirit+amid+the+ruins+of+the+20th+Century&limit=100&listNamespace=movabletype140&parentUri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fblogs%2Fnewsnight%2Fpaulmason%2F2010%2F10%2Fgary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html&filter=&preset=blog&postStyle=richtext&comments_page=2#dna-comments">Last</a> </li>  </ul> <div class="hidden dna-tab-loading loading"><img src="http://static.bbc.co.uk/modules/comments/1.9.4/img/loader.gif" alt="loading" /></div> <div style="clear: both"></div> </div>    </div>  </div> <div class="dna-comments-footer">    <div class="dna-commentbox-logged-out">  <a name="dna-comment-error"></a> <div class="comments-error"></div>  </div>   <div class="dna-commentbox-logged-in" style="display: none;"> <a name="postcomment"></a> <h3>Post a comment</h3>  <a name="dna-comment-error"></a> <div class="comments-error"></div>  <div> <form class="postcomment dna-commentbox" method="post" action="http://www.bbc.co.uk/modules/comments/index/post/" id="submit_new_comment"> <input type="hidden" name="forumId" value="movabletype140_264252" /> <input type="hidden" name="siteId" value="blog140" /> <input type="hidden" name="parentUri" value="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/paulmason/2010/10/gary_indiana_unbroken_spirit_a.html" /> <input type="hidden" name="title" value="Gary, Indiana: Unbroken spirit amid the ruins of the 20th Century"/> <input type="hidden" name="integrityHash" value="66c3723fcb0e6c60133fa223de6dbd56" /> <input type="hidden" name="num_comments" value="130" /> <input type="hidden" name="policy" value="" /> <input type="hidden" name="bbc_id_env" value="id.bbc.co.uk" /> <input type="hidden" name="postStyle" value="richtext" /> <input type="hidden" name="csrftoken" class="dna-comments-csrf" value="+8r8rfLcJ/W/dhNrEHVAIcX/VFL7JtcORj3ljvSvjo7FeHvrl9cFINxPcAKu2fy48yAl6JRfcemGSnmmsC8YTg9G3krOSqaiVLypaDqD2oAZLaiwyig=" />   <p>All posts are pre-moderated. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/moderation.shtml#how" class="no-popup" target="_blank">What does this mean?</a></p>   <p>  <div class="dna-textarea-container"> <textarea id="dna-commentbox-text" name="comment"></textarea> </div>  </p> <p class="dna-comments-footer"> <span class="dna-tab-posting"><span></span><img src="http://static.bbc.co.uk/modules/comments/1.9.4/img/loader.gif" alt="posting" /></span> <input class="dna-commentbox-preview" type="button" value="Preview"/> <input id="dna-commentbox-submit" type="submit" value="Post Comment"/> </p> </form> <div class="dna-comment-preview"></div> </div> </div>    </div> </div>

		   	<div class="inner">
				I'm Paul Mason, Newsnight’s economics editor, a job that takes me from Kenyan shanty towns to Russian hedge funds and Chinese factories. My blog is called Idle Scrawl. It veers wildly across the subject: from house prices, to global poverty; from deconstructing glib terminology to devastating critiques of the England football management. It is occasionally meant to be funny. Follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/paulmasonnews">Twitter</a>
