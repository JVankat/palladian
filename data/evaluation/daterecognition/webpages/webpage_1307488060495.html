                                    <h1>Use of BIM by Facility Owners: An &quot;Expotitions&quot; 
                                      Meeting</h1>
                                    <p>Towards the end of last month, I was invited 
                                      to participate in a meeting of the &quot;Expotitions&quot; 
                                      group, a B2B (Business to Business) roundtable 
                                      of real estate, design, and construction 
                                      professionals located in the San Francisco 
                                      Bay area. This group has been around for 
                                      several years, conducting informal meetings 
                                      every few months to discuss a wide rage 
                                      of issues related to real estate and construction. 
                                      Some of the recent meetings were devoted 
                                      to topics such as scenario planning, flexible 
                                      leasing, flexible facilities, rising construction 
                                      costs, alternate officing, biotechnology 
                                      and health services, offshoring operations, 
                                      and so on. The meeting on April 25, the 
                                      one I attended, was entitled &quot;Building 
                                      Information Modeling: Future Technology 
                                      Shift,&quot; and featured a panel discussion 
                                      of four facility owners who were utilizing 
                                      this emerging technology: the GSA, Intel, 
                                      LucasFilm, and Walt Disney Imagineering. 
                                      The highlights of their presentations and 
                                      the ensuing discussion are captured in this 
                                      AECbytes &quot;Building the Future&quot; 
                                      article. </P>
                                    <p>But first, a brief note about the word 
                                      &quot;expotition,&quot; if you are wondering 
                                      what it means. The Expotitions group defines 
                                      it as &quot;a journey of discovery with 
                                      no predetermined destination.&quot; I hadn't 
                                      heard of this word before I heard of this 
                                      group, and it does not appear in any dictionary 
                                      either. On <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=expotition&hl=en&lr=&rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-28,GGLG:en&start=0&sa=N" target="_blank">researching</a> 
                                      the word on the Internet, I found that it 
                                      comes from A.A. Milne, noted author of the 
                                      Winnie-the-Pooh books, who made it up as 
                                      Pooh's word for a special adventure in the 
                                      classic story &quot;An Expotition To The 
                                      North Pole,&quot; where Pooh and his friends 
                                      set out to find the northern-most place 
                                      on earth. &quot;Expotition&quot; is like 
                                      an &quot;expedition,&quot; but more focused 
                                      on discovery and fun. While mostly used 
                                      in connection with Winnie-the-Pooh, I did 
                                      come across its occasional use online as 
                                      an alternate to the words &quot;expedition&quot; 
                                      or &quot;journey.&quot; </p>
                                    <p>Let's see how the &quot;expotition&quot; 
                                      into BIM for the San Francisco Bay area 
                                      B2B group turned out.</p>
                                    <h2>Presentations by Facility Owners Using 
                                      BIM</h2>
                                    <p>The GSA (US General Services Administration, 
                                      the largest builder-owner of federal projects 
                                      in the country) has been one of the leading 
                                      owners at the forefront of BIM implementation, 
                                      and I have frequently written about their 
                                      presentations at various conferences, most 
                                      recently the Technology for Construction 
                                      2006 conference (see the article, <a href="TFC2006_sessions.html" target="_blank">The 
                                      Executive Forum and Other Sessions at Technology 
                                      for Construction 2006</a>). The GSA has 
                                      even taken the extreme step of mandating 
                                      the use of IFC-based BIM and believes that 
                                      BIM adoption should not be driven by cost 
                                      savings alone, but for its many other benefits 
                                      such as the ability to explore different 
                                      engineering systems, perform energy analysis 
                                      for LEED certification, derive specifications 
                                      automatically, and eventually eliminate 
                                      the use of paper and paper-based processes. 
                                      At the Expotitions meeting, Dr. Calvin Kam 
                                      of the GSA shed some more light on why BIM 
                                      is important to the GSA, both in the near 
                                      term as well as in the long term. BIM is 
                                      currently being used by the GSA for immediate 
                                      needs such as creating as-built documentation 
                                      for existing buildings, space reporting, 
                                      spatial management and tenant management, 
                                      and evaluating how well a proposed design 
                                      meets the program requirements. It is helping 
                                      the GSA take on its biggest challenges&#151;delivering 
                                      high-performance buildings on schedule and 
                                      in a cost-effective manner. The GSA also 
                                      has a more far-reaching lifecycle vision 
                                      of BIM&#151;where its benefits will be realized 
                                      during construction and operation in addition 
                                      to the design phase&#151;but acknowledges 
                                      that it is not there yet. In the meantime, 
                                      it is conducting research and launching 
                                      pilot projects that integrate cost estimating, 
                                      spatial analysis, and energy analysis applications 
                                      with BIM. Another aspect of the design that 
                                      is rapidly emerging as a critical one for 
                                      evaluation, in the wake of both terrorist 
                                      threats and natural calamities, is disaster 
                                      response. For this, the GSA is exploring 
                                      the &quot;avatar&quot; technology from the 
                                      gaming industry that creates the simulation 
                                      of human behavior in virtual people. This 
                                      would allow, for instance, a BIM model to 
                                      be populated with electronic people programmed 
                                      with behaviors such as walking, running, 
                                      turning, detecting the nearest exit, and 
                                      so on, which would allow the egress pattern 
                                      and time in a proposed building to be studied 
                                      in the event of an emergency. This technology 
                                      is not expected to become commonplace any 
                                      time soon, but it is certainly indicative 
                                      of the powerful analysis capabilities that 
                                      can become available when sophisticated 
                                      technologies such as BIM (intelligent virtual 
                                      buildings) and avatars (intelligent virtual 
                                      people) are combined.<br>

                                      Another owner perspective on BIM was presented 
                                      by Mike Alianza of Intel Corporation, which 
                                      by virtue of being one of the largest high-tech 
                                      companies in the world also has a lot of 
                                      facilities to build and maintain, and is 
                                      therefore very interested in the potential 
                                      benefits of BIM throughout the lifecycle 
                                      of a building. Currently, Intel is primarily 
                                      exploiting this potential at the design 
                                      and construction stage by using BIM models 
                                      for better coordination, clash detection 
                                      during design, schedule integration, and 
                                      to study construction sequencing. For Intel, 
                                      the construction phase is currently the 
                                      biggest beneficiary of BIM, with design 
                                      having a relatively smaller portion of the 
                                      pie. At the same time, Intel recognizes 
                                      the tremendous potential of BIM in the operations 
                                      and maintenance phase, in performing what-if 
                                      scenarios of moving people and equipment 
                                      in facilities, analyzing and minimizing 
                                      energy usage, operating facilities more 
                                      efficiently, as well as operating and managing 
                                      them virtually. Another important future 
                                      benefit would be the ability to carry design 
                                      designs all the way into the BIM model, 
                                      so that they can be analyzed at any time 
                                      by back-tracking, which is very important 
                                      for a huge corporation like Intel. Also 
                                      important from the point of view of convenience, 
                                      accessibility, and ease of use is the ability 
                                      to have all the building information stored 
                                      electronically in one or multiple models 
                                      as opposed to receiving a couple of hundred 
                                      boxes of documentation from the design and 
                                      construction team. While the potential of 
                                      BIM at the operations and maintenance phase 
                                      is still far from being realized, it is 
                                      real enough for a company like Intel to 
                                      make a serious effort to start incorporating 
                                      BIM in its building process.</p>
                                    <p>In the last few years, some recent building 
                                      projects have become &quot;poster boys&quot; 
                                      for their advanced use of 3D modeling and 
                                      BIM, of which George Lucas's Letterman Digital 
                                      Arts Center in San Francisco is a great 
                                      example. We have had several presentations 
                                      at various conferences describing the modeling 
                                      aspect of the project by Mitch Boryslawski 
                                      of View by View, the company responsible 
                                      for managing the 3D modeling and coordination. 
                                      At the Expotitions meeting, the owner's 
                                      perspective on this project was presented 
                                      by John Wynne of Lucasfilm. The design for 
                                      the Digital Arts Center was actually done 
                                      in the traditional 2D way, and it was only 
                                      after the permitting process was completed 
                                      that the BIM work began. The primary motivation 
                                      for using 3D modeling was the complexity 
                                      of the project, which made clash detection 
                                      and coordination very critical. George Lucas 
                                      himself was personally involved in all the 
                                      design decisions, and he strongly pushed 
                                      the use of advanced technology for the project. 
                                      The effort of creating and coordinating 
                                      detailed 3D models for all the different 
                                      components of the building was well worth 
                                      it as a lot of conflicts were detected, 
                                      which would have been very expensive to 
                                      fix had they remained undetected until the 
                                      time of construction. In addition to clash 
                                      detection and coordination, the model was 
                                      also successfully used for 3D visualization, 
                                      simulating the construction sequence, and 
                                      energy analysis, which was important since 
                                      this was a Gold LEED project. The model 
                                      was also used to a lesser extent for 4D 
                                      construction scheduling. Construction on 
                                      this project began in January 2003 and is 
                                      now almost complete. There are no definite 
                                      plans yet to continue to use BIM for facilities 
                                      management and operations, although that 
                                      would seem to be the next logical step. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In my newsletter on <a href="../../newsletter/2005/issue_24.html" target="_blank">Autodesk 
                                      University 2005</a>, I briefly described 
                                      the keynote address by Tom McCann of Walt 
                                      Disney Imagineering (WDI), that arm of Disney 
                                      which is responsible for designing and creating 
                                      the thrills and rides in the 11 Disney theme 
                                      parks across the world. The process WDI 
                                      uses to design the attractions has some 
                                      close parallels with the design and construction 
                                      of a building, thus making the use of 3D 
                                      tools equally relevant. At the Expotitions 
                                      meeting, Chris Holm of WDI shed some more 
                                      light on this process. WDI refers to their 
                                      use of modeling technology as &quot;virtual 
                                      design and construction&quot; rather than 
                                      BIM, and needless to say, they cannot use 
                                      traditional BIM tools for designing attractions. 
                                      However, they do create intelligent 3D models 
                                      that are primarily focused on the structure 
                                      of the attraction, for which they use structural 
                                      BIM applications along with structural analysis 
                                      tools. Other non-supporting elements of 
                                      the attraction are also modeled along with 
                                      the components that make up the ride. 4D 
                                      time sequencing is then applied to the model 
                                      to determine critical aspects of the ride 
                                      such as sequence, flow, speed, and so on. 
                                      The model is also used for clash detection 
                                      in the structure, as well as for the prefabrication 
                                      of the steel required to build the attraction. 
                                      In addition, once the attraction has been 
                                      completed and is in operation, the model 
                                      is used to help the operators better understand 
                                      how to operate and navigate the rides. In 
                                      the past, physical models were used for 
                                      the entire process, which was very difficult, 
                                      time-consuming, and prone to errors. The 
                                      move to electronic modeling was initiated 
                                      in 2001, and each year, some additional 
                                      steps are taken towards making the transition 
                                      from paper to digital. </p>
                                    <h2>Audience Q/A and Discussion</h2>
                                    <p>While there wasn't that much time for an 
                                      extensive Q/A session at the meeting, some 
                                      interesting issues did emerge from the discussion. 
                                      The biggest one was that of the transition 
                                      to BIM, and the overall consensus was that 
                                      the &quot;pain&quot; was not really in the 
                                      technology or in learning it, but in the 
                                      change of the business process that is involved. 
                                      To put it in another way, 70% of the change 
                                      that is needed to move to BIM is going to 
                                      be cultural, while the technology will account 
                                      for only 30% of it. All the panelists shared 
                                      their companies' perspectives on the change 
                                      issue. The GSA, because of its size, finds 
                                      itself slower to change, but it is trying 
                                      to be as adaptive and flexible as possible, 
                                      and is committed to BIM. Intel, on the other 
                                      hand, has not yet been able to procure a 
                                      corporate-wide statement of faith in BIM. 
                                      In the case of Walt Disney Engineering, 
                                      the ability to change has become easier 
                                      in the last 18 months, no doubt because 
                                      of the rapidly changing pace of technology 
                                      in general. And as this is only expected 
                                      to accelerate in the future, the AEC industry 
                                      should find that change will be much easier 
                                      and more rapid than is currently anticipated. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For some members of the audience, however, 
                                      the issue of the technology itself was also 
                                      of great importance, in particular the dilemma 
                                      of which BIM solution to adopt. According 
                                      to them, making the leap to BIM would be 
                                      so enormously expensive that it cannot be 
                                      done twice. Unfortunately, there are no 
                                      easy answers to this problem, particularly 
                                      when a firm is open to solutions from any 
                                      vendor rather than predisposed or committed 
                                      to a particular one. The only option then 
                                      is to carry out a systematic evaluation 
                                      of all available solutions to determine 
                                      which one best suits a company's style, 
                                      philosophy, mode of working, and the other 
                                      firms it needs to collaborate with. </p>
                                    <p>Getting back to the owner's perspective&#151;which, 
                                      after all, was what the event was all about&#151;some 
                                      felt that owners need to look beyond the 
                                      immediate benefits of BIM in the design 
                                      and construction phase and focus on the 
                                      long-term benefits they will realize in 
                                      their facilities management and operations 
                                      processes. Others did not think this was 
                                      the right approach as BIM-based FM tools 
                                      are not yet available, so the owner <em>should</em> 
                                      be motivated by the efficiencies in the 
                                      design and construction stage to stipulate 
                                      the use of BIM on their projects. Then there 
                                      were those who even questioned the use of 
                                      BIM in smaller &quot;real world&quot; projects 
                                      of under $50 million, in contrast to the 
                                      larger and signature projects that had been 
                                      showcased by the panel. According to these 
                                      AEC professionals, the overall quality of 
                                      work in the industry was going downhill, 
                                      drawings were getting less detailed, and 
                                      ligitation was increasing. In this context, 
                                      how could BIM help, considering that some 
                                      subcontractors were so removed from technology 
                                      that they did not even use email? </p>
                                    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                                    <p>The Expotitions meeting ended with more 
                                      questions than answers for many members 
                                      of the audience to whom BIM was a new concept, 
                                      and a follow-up discussion on the same topic 
                                      is on the agenda for the next meeting in 
                                      June. As someone who is very familiar with 
                                      BIM, most of the issues that were discussed 
                                      were not new to me and having attended several 
                                      similar sessions in various conferences 
                                      over the last few years, what continues 
                                      to surprise me is the amount of time that 
                                      is still spent on debating BIM. I see BIM 
                                      as a logical evolution from CAD, the next 
                                      technological step for the AEC industry, 
                                      and very much in tune with the technological 
                                      advancements happening in other fields and 
                                      in society as a whole. While BIM may be 
                                      a complex technology, we should try and 
                                      avoid making its adoption so much more complicated 
                                      than it needs to be. We spend far too much 
                                      time dwelling on the difficulties involved 
                                      in making the change, and we are constantly 
                                      trying to look too far ahead to see what 
                                      benefits BIM can bring down the road. While 
                                      a long-term perspective is important, the 
                                      focus should be on what we can achieve with 
                                      BIM in the near term and trying to find 
                                      the best way to do it. I think we can only 
                                      make some serious headway with BIM in the 
                                      AEC industry as a whole when we start taking 
                                      it for granted&#151;just as we take CAD 
                                      for granted now&#151;and focus on the &quot;how&quot; 
                                      rather than on the &quot;why.&quot;</p>
