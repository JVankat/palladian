Wouldn't it be satisfying if the energy being put in to help sort out our
misdirected world could turn things around? It would be comforting to think
so but realistically the banks, corporate media and other transnational
corporations, the merger maniacal 'dark side', are extending their monopolistic
control.
<P>
The modern transnational corporation is an immortal, soulless collusion of
greed that reduces everything it touches to a dollar value. In law a corporation
is a person, able to own property and resources just as a person can only,
it seems, not responsible for the deaths it causes. The present 'War on Terror'
is a fraudulent attempt to create a new Moslem enemy, much like the attack
on the Jew's in the 1930's. Nato and many Western Military masters are following
the <A HREF="2004.htm#gladio" TARGET="_new">same tactics</A> as Hitler's
Nazis.

<P>
The Law has been appropriated, twisted by the establishmet elite and used
as a tool against ordinary people. God's law is simple:
<H3>
  Old Testament: The Ten Commandments:
</H3>
<H4>
  Thou shalt have no other gods before Yahweh (The LORD God)<BR>
  Thou shalt not make nor worship idols<BR>
  Thou shalt not take Yahweh's name in vain<BR>
  Remember the Sabbath day (Saturday) and keep it holy (rest)<BR>
  Honour thy father and mother<BR>
  Thou shall not kill<BR>
  Thou shall not commit adultery (sex outside marriage)<BR>
  Thou shalt not steal<BR>
  Thou shalt not lie<BR>
  Thou shalt not desire thy neighbours property [Exodus 20]
</H4>
<H3>
  New Testament: Jesus's Two Commandments
</H3>
<H4>
  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul and
  with all thy mind.<BR>
  Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself [Matthew 22:36-38]
</H4>
<H3>
  New Testament: The Lord's Prayer
</H3>
<H4>
  Our Father,<BR>
  Who art in heaven,<BR>
  Hallowed by thy name,<BR>
  Thy kingdom come,<BR>
  Thy will be done,<BR>
  On earth as it is in heaven.<BR>
  Give us this day our daily bread,<BR>
  And forgive us our sins,<BR>
  As we forgive those who sin against us.<BR>
  Lead us not into temptation,<BR>
  But deliver us from evil,<BR>
  For thine is the kingdom,<BR>
  The power and the glory,<BR>
  For ever and ever.<BR>
  In Yeshuah's name.

<P>
The Bible encourages us to put faith into action every day. Jesus' (His actual
name was <I>Yeshua. Jesus</I> is a Greek translation) Jesus' direct action
in the temple - overturning the tables of the moneychangers and the traders
who had monopolised the market and were selling overpriced goods for sacrifice
- condemning them all as a 'den of thieves' is one of the most inspiring
moments in the New Testament. Though the fact that it was the only occasion
that Jesus used force in his ministry tells us not to see civil disobedience
as the only solution in what is essentially a spiritual battle, or a battle
for the truth over the lies of the devil and his human servants.

  My <A NAME="spiritual">spiritual</A> beliefs
</H2>
<P>
I have looked at many spiritual beliefs but nothing has spoken to me me on
as high a level as Jesus' teachings and actions. The sermon on the mount
(Matthew 5-7) shows that no-one has ever understood the importance of love,
nor exactly what it means, more than the Messiah long-promised by God.
<P>
Many problems have been caused by some of the Jewish people's refusal to
acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. Many Jews, for example, live in old Testament
Torah Times - believeing they are still 'God's chosen people'. It seems clear
to me that God cut off the Jewish heirarchy from his favour after they pleaded
successfully for the&nbsp;unjust death of his only son.&nbsp;The Israeli
state's brutal and racist treatment of the Palestinian people makes it clear
to me that Israel is&nbsp;no longer interested in the will of God.
<P>
I am a <A HREF="http://www.quaker.org.uk" TARGET="_new">Quaker</A> because
I am not very excited by&nbsp;Britain's establishment church (the CofE) and
'middle men' like vicars &amp; professional priests, or pastors generally.
Nevertheless I recognise that they are caught in a very difficult bind -
between their beliefs and their career and that many are great men and women
of God.
<P>
The Old Testament prophecies that told of the coming of a Messiah, coupled
with Jesus's attitude to the ecclesiastical and legal hierarchies of his
day, have led me to examine the Bible more closely and find, life changing
prophecies of the 'End Times', particularly relating to the re-establishment
of His people, Isreal.
<P>
At least 52 different aspects of Christ's coming were prophesied in the Old
Testament (<A HREF="trib.htm#52" TARGET="_new">see pp. xxvi-xxix, Jewish
New Testament ISBN 965 359 006 5, Jewish New Testament Pubs. Inc. Maryland
N.J. U.S.A.</A>). Yet still He was not recognised as God's 'anointed one'
or 'Messiah' by many Jews.
<P>
With a bit of Bible study we can be sure not to be deceived as the prophecies
of the End Times unfold and Christ returns ultimately in glory for all the
world to see.

We could be in for some serious skullduggery in coming years/months. A
political/financial crisis, combined with spiritual disinformation could
push us into a Fourth Reich, New World Order, with an official world religion
that claims to represent ALL religions. This is what Prince Charles is advocating
NOW. Powerful people will certainly be preparing their version of a spiritual
'panacea' to fill the spiritual gap THEY have created.

<P>
Whilst political action against the greedy and for positive solutions gives
us hope, it doesn't necessarily add up to much against the combined power
of the capitalists, the armed forces and many of the media bosses! So the
solution, it seems, will be spiritual and not political. We are in the middle
of an an undeclared spiritual war and here The Bible is a peaceful but potent
weapon - here are some passages which have meant a lot to me and form a basis
for a different 'church' to the one most of us know. Some churches concentrate
on this side of Christianity but most still use a single paid (and unbiblical)
pastor.
<P>
I found myself drawn to Quakerism because we emphasise individual faith and
testimony: The Society of Freinds was founded in England in the seventeenth
century at the same time as the birth of state capitalism. The merchant classes
in England conducted a comprehensive takeover from the aristocracy.
<P>
For more on The Quakers see the Journal of George Fox, itinerant man of God
and the society's founder. Fox emphasised a direct personal relationship
with God, through the Holy Spirit, and the need to repent in ones heart of
previous sins, to be reconciled to God and forgiven.

  A brief biog.
</H3>
<H4>
  I was born in Gravesend, Kent in 1962 and brought up in Bromley, South London.
  I ended my formal education at Ilkley College in West Yorkshire with a Humanities
  degree, specialising in English Literature, from Bradford University. After
  working for a few years in the family aviation business I decided to have
  a go at radio journalism. <BR>
  Volunteering at the GLC funded
  <I><A HREF="http://www.infoxone.com/main/b340220.htm" TARGET="_new">Radio
  Thamesmead</A> </I>(now Time FM 106.8)&nbsp;in South East London I eventually
  became their full-time volunteer editor of community programmes. RTM applied
  for, and got, an FM licence from the Radio Authority but as part of the financial
  deal manager Bob Smith took many of the best presenters off the air. I therefore
  left in 1991 for a researchers job at
  <I><A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/londonlive/" TARGET="_new">Greater London
  Radio</A></I>, the BBC's station for London. <BR>
  In 1992 I moved to
  <A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/england/radiosolent/" TARGET="_new"><I>BBC
  Radio Solent</I> </A>as a reporter and then on to
  <I><A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/england/wiltshiresound/" TARGET="_new">BBC
  Wiltshire Sound</A>,</I> where I worked as Salisbury reporter, relief presenter
  and documentary maker. When Wiltshire Sound had a 'cash crisis' the BBC decided
  they no longer required my services. I moved to the Lake District where I
  took a year out then moved to Oxford where I got involved with environmental
  campaigning, volunteering at
  <I><A HREF="http://www.tlio.org.uk" TARGET="_new">The Land Is Ours</A></I>
  helping to organise land occupations in the mid to late 1990's. <BR>
  After moving to Bristol and getting into investigative journalism I helped
  establish <I><A HREF="http://www.videonetwork.org" TARGET="_new">i-Contact
  video network</A></I> and
  <I><A HREF="http://www.ecovillages.org/uk/network/" TARGET="_new">Ecovillage
  network UK</A></I>. I spent a year on the National Executive of the NUJ and
  eight years as Secretary, then Vice-Chair of the Bristol branch of the
  <I><A HREF="http://www.nuj.org.uk" TARGET="_new">National Union of
  Journalists</A></I> until the 2009 AGM when I resigned from the Bristol
  executive. <BR>
  I joined the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, in June 2005 and I
  delivered my first lecture on the Seventeenth Century Illuminati in October
  2006. <BR>
  Since Easter 2009 I have produced and presented

<P>
In true 'Desert Island Discs' style I have to here recommend another book
as well as the Bible which I have found a tremendous testimony to the living
God from the more recent past. That is the Journal, effectively an autobiography,
of George Fox. This is the man who founded the Quakers or 'Society of Friends'
during the English Civil War and his life was a tremendous journey as a simple
follower of Christ's discerning message of love. Fox did not look for material
gain and was, just like Jesus himself, regularly persecuted and plotted against
for his simple Christian faith which was considered revolutionary by the
established church. He called a spade a spade and suffered for his honesty,
sometimes being put through terrible ordeals by his so-called Christian
'betters'. Through all this, right through the tulmut of the mid seventeenth
century, God was by his side. <BR>

Action, not words is what changes things. Non-Violent Direct Action is, in

    SRC="squat.jpg">Like the days of Noah society is going way off course, the
family and marriage is becoming uncool in modern junk culture shaped by monied
power. Cultural gatekeepers in the BBC keep crucial issues like landlessness
and monetary reform off the agenda. If they do appear its always in a diluted
form.

  <I>"Landlessness is slavery"</I>

To casual Christians, the logical 'progress' of humanity should mean that
things would be getting better and better with people living in a happier
and increasingly loving world. To them, present world events are puzzling.
However this is a comfortable view which ignores Holy Scripture and its Biblical
prophecies, some of which may have been fulfilled already.
<P>
The ultimate overthrow of evil is predicted in the Bible and the mission
of a loving God but the established churches seem to ignore the most relevant
bits. If a vicar speaks out against the Church establishment he risks getting
kicked out of a job and his rectory home like any other employee.

  Here's a bit of space devoted to quite possibly the greatest comedian ever.
  Certainly the most un-Politically Correct cutting comedy I've ever seen...
</H3>
<H4>
  Was Bill a Christian? - Well you might be amazed to hear I am convinced he
  was. In his unique cheeky style he said some things just before he died that
  convince me he had been hiding his open-mindedness to Jesus' message. If
  you don't believe me do please check out his final televised interviews on
  the net.<BR>
  The official release of this interview has shamelessly edited his pro Jesus
  comments out.<BR>
  Try finding the original recordings of his last interview via. a multimedia
  search engine such as

  "<CITE>The world is like a ride at an amusement park and when you choose
  to go on it you think its real because that's how powerful our minds are.
  And the ride goes up and down and round and round, it has thrills and chills
  and it's very brightly coloured and its very loud and its fun, for a while.
  </CITE>
</H3>
<H3>
  <CITE>Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to
  question: is this real or is this just a ride? </CITE>
</H3>
<H3>
  <CITE>And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and they
  say: hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because: this is just a ride.
  And we....... </CITE>

  at my furrows of worry. Look at my big bank account, and my family... This

</H3>
<H3>
  <CITE>It's just a ride, and we can change it any time we want. It's only
  a choice, no effort, no work, no job, no savings of money, a choice right
  now between fear and love. </CITE>
</H3>
<H3>
  <CITE>The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns,
  close yourself off, the eyes of love instead see all of us as one.</CITE>
</H3>
<H3>
  <CITE>Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride:
  take all that money we spend on weapons and defence each year and instead
  spend it feeding clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would
  many times over, not one human being excluded, and we can explore space together,
  both inner and outer, forever, in peace.</CITE>"

  "Television works to control the society, to keep the culture credulous,

  explanation of the end of Bill Hicks' career and his untimely death, from
  <I>Totally</I>, one of the Bill Hicks videos.

  <P ALIGN=Left>
  [Robert Morton - Producer, The David Letterman Show]:
</H4>
<P ALIGN=Left>
We always pushed the envelope, by seeing OK, just how much of a fuck-you
attitude can you have, without going over the line on network television.
And that was always the thrill of presenting it.
<H4>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  ON OCTOBER 1st 1993 BILL HICKS' TWELFTH AND FINAL APPEARANCE ON THE DAVID
  LETTERMAN SHOW WAS CUT FROM THE TRANSMITTED PROGRAMME
</H4>
<H4>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  [Richard Belzer]:<BR>
  I can't quote you club owners or television executives by name, but I know
  that the nature of what Bill did was not universally applauded and accepted
  because it did challenge the status quo and it might upset certain political
  sensibilities in the audience and in the corporate structure.
</H4>
<H4>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  [John Lahr - Critic, The New Yorker]:<BR>
  When his stuff was taken off the air or whatever, he wrote me a 32-page letter,
  hand-written, a sort of a creed, he couldn't understand the situation, just
  because, he was a free spirit, it was a joke, these jokes had import. But
  it was the prescribing of his freedom which so offended him.
</H4>
<H4>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  [David Letterman]:<BR>
  Well, our relationship with Bill Hicks came to kind of a peculiar ending,
  made all the more peculiar by the man's death. And I have personal regrets
  about how our relationship developed prior to his death. So it makes me doubly
  sad that he is now not around so that we can I think, correct mistakes that
  were made on his behalf. So I feel a personal sense of regret regarding that.
</H4>
<H4>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  [John Lahr - Critic, The New Yorker]:<BR>
  And what it did also do was give him more material for his belief, correct
  in my view, that television worked to control the society, to keep the culture
  credulous, to keep it from thinking, to enchant it literally, to spellbind
  it. And his job, as he saw it, was to break the spell.
</H4>
<H4>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  [Bill Hicks]:<BR>
  Go back to bed, America, your government has figured out how it all transpired,
  go back to bed America, your government is in control again. Here, here's
  American Gladiators, watch this, shut up, go back to bed America, here is
  American Gladiators, here is 56 channels of it, watch these pituitary retards
  bang their fucking skulls together and congratulate yourselves you're living

  An <A NAME="out">out</A>-cry of the poor oppressed people of Britain and
  the world
</H1>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The desire of traders to acquire wealth down the years has turned into greed
of horrific proportions. Bankers, bosses of Transnational Corporations and
media tycoons at the 'top' wash their hands of responsibility for the deaths
of millions of innocent people across the world. "You want to change things...",
they say, "get the politicians to do it!" But they pay and arm the politicians
to do the opposite, to rob the needy and concentrate even more wealth in
the hands of the rich. Its obscene. The politicians may be ours one day every
five years, but they're under the influence of the super-rich for the other
1,824! That gives ordinary people hardly any say at all.

</H4>
<P>
In the forties and fifties technologists invented a weapon that could wipe
out mankind, if not life on earth. The thermonuclear
<A HREF="hbomb.htm">H-bomb</A> meant that if wealth was to be acquired it
would have to be done stealthily and without upsetting governments. For this
and other reasons big business around the world came together to formalize
networks of influence with virtually limitless resources that transcended
national boundaries and they began the final moves towards privatising the
Earth. They knew the main difficulty would be the nation state so they plotted
its downfall. <I><A HREF="bildhist.htm#The">Read more about this</A></I>
<P>
The Earth is, as Gerrard Winstanley and the
<A HREF="land/diggers.htm">Diggers</A> knew: <B><I>'...a common treasury
for all...' </I></B>but its been gradually acquired as the 'private property'
of the super-rich land-lords. Not even individuals but corporations. See
the documentary film <I>The Corporation</I>. No doubt, this is not how God
intended it to work!
<H3>
  And God wants us to know and use his name <I>Yahweh</I> in prayer. The idea
  that it is somehow a 'secret' only for the 'initiated' is diabolical nonsense.

  <P ALIGN=Center>
  YHWH - the Tetragrammaton - God's name - usually written Yahweh<BR>
  One correspondent told me this means simply - "I AM DOING WHAT I AM DOING"<BR>
  Another correspondent added: The Sacred Name of GOD is: "YHVH"- Pronounced:
  Yeh-Ha-Veh, which is the Etymology of "EHYEH-ASHER-EHYEH" translated "I Am
  that I Am". Moses asked what is your name, and GOD answered, "I Am that I
  Am", tell them I AM (EHYEH) has sent you. <BR>
  Names of GOD are: <BR>
  Elowahh - which means "Deity".<BR>
  Elohiym - plural of Elowahh. <BR>
  El - which means "The Almighty".<BR>
  Yehovah - which means "Eternal or Self Existent".<BR>
  Yehovih - same as "Yehovah" but used to prevent repetition<BR>
  Yahh - the short form of "Yehovah" .

<P>
The mainstream media is becoming lifeless with many of the most sensitive
and clued up contributors sacked and edited out. Ideas for programmes are
stolen as a matter of course now and those ideas twisted to the corporate
- money is god - agenda. The arts have been taken over by the CIA (see the
book <I>The Cultural Cold War</I>), advertisers and miserable rich patrons
who want to simply use them to make money or express misery through conceptual
or post-modern art and grotesque public art programmes.
<P>
We all want rewarding work because our time is all we have in this life and
that precious time they want us to waste doing the donkey-work of the
mean-spirited rich. Building their diseased nightmares for them. No wonder
we wage slaves feel sick working for them.
<P>
The 'joys' of prostituting ourselves to the global, corporate top-down business
structures are crumbling around us. Low wages, short term (if any) contracts,
doubts about social security/welfare and pensions, casual labour, union bashing,
all of these trends make working for hire incrementally less attractive.
It's nearly impossible to get out of the system since our fundamental rights
and needs (see <I>Mazlow's hierarchy of needs</I>), especially for land,
have been stripped away. The government even extorts income tax from employees
so that just about everything you do is, at least in part, working for the
corporate state. They love it when we're feeding the whims of the rich.
<H4>
  Why? There is <A HREF="../lucis.htm" TARGET="_new">a deliberate attempt to
  destroy all our political and spiritual aspirations.</A>
</H4>
<P>
The 'democratic' governments of the world have become little more than a
perverted mishmash of public relations and protection racket.
<P>
Anyway... back to what we can do about it.
<P>
First we can refuse to compromise, that means refusing to swallow lies. <B>I
feel better already! </B>We can all acknowledge the sad and sorry tale of
the corrupt system.
<P>
So - we can <I>all</I> shine the spotlight into murky corners where the elites
would rather we didn't. Let the world see what they are up to and see how
they are taking us all for a ride, living off the land and the labour of
others. Secondly we can turn our backs on their rotten hierarchical system
of haves and have nots. "Oh poverty has always been there and it is a natural
part of life that there will be winners and losers", they say... but its
getting worse for those at the bottom at one hell of a rate and that's paganism,
the law of the jungle. We want to live in a caring society where we can reject
man's 'laws' of competition and selfishness in favour of agreements of
co-operation, collectivism and return to God's law. The Ten Commandments
and love thy neighbour as thyself.
<P>
As <A HREF="land/diggers.htm">Gerrard Winstanley the Digger</A> said back
in 1648:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <I>"Dear friends, It hath been the universall condition of the earth (mankind)
  to be over-spread with a black cloud of darkness; and the knowledge of the
  King of righteousness hath been manifested but in some few scattered ones...
  ...I spoke the name of God, and Lord, and Christ, but I knew not this Lord,
  God and Christ; I prayed to a God but I knew not where he was, nor what he
  was, and so walking by imagination, I worshipped that devill, and called
  him God; by reason wherof my comforts were often shaken to pieces, and at
  last it was shewed to me, That while I builded upon any words or writings
  of other men, or while I looked after a God without me, I did but build upon
  the sand, and as yet I knew not the rock." </I> <BR>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="380" HEIGHT="257" SRC="jontiff1.gif">
<P>
Anyway, the second thing is to turn away from the dying system and to start
making our own spaces, like this one, part of a low impact settlement.
<P>
In places like this we can work not for hire but voluntarily for what we
want. We can agree our own rules and continue the process of coming together,
organising in new ways of living. Treading lightly on the earth, not seeing
it simply as a resource to plunder.
<P>
We can get ourselves organised by meeting up with people of a similar mind
and take pride in being regarded as 'serious criminals' according to one
of the UK's latest bits of fascist legislation, the Police Act 1997, because
we dare participate in '...conduct by a number of persons in pursuit of a
common purpose...'
<P>
By doing so we risk our homes and solicitors offices being bugged and camera'd
up by the police and MI5, and our houses being secretly searched, without
a warrant. Under the act, intelligence information on us can now be sold
or 'exchanged for gifts of property' with any business the police think could
make good use of it. Legalised bribery, just as the money system is legalised
counterfeiting.
<P>
The Criminal Justice Act 1995 is a criminal Act of Parliament which, like
the Public Order Act, gives the police power without responsibility. It makes
innocent &nbsp;fringe lifestyles: travellers, ravers etc. virtually illegal
and was part of the militarisation of the police. Just like the Nazis.
<P>
For me Britain had crossed the Rubicon on the journey to a police state.
It was illegal to be outside the government approved system, to be different.
It's what made me decide it wasn't enough to sit by and watch it happen.

<H2>
  THE MORES
</H2>
<P>
John Clare
<P>
Far spread the moorey ground a level scene <BR>
Bespread with rush and one eternal green <BR>
That never felt the rage of blundering plough <BR>
Though centurys wreathed spring's blossoms on its brow
<P>
Still meeting plains that stretched them far away <BR>
In uncheckt shadows of green brown, and grey
<P>
Unbounded freedom ruled the wandering scene <BR>
Nor fence of ownership crept in between <BR>
To hide the prospect of the following eye <BR>
Its only bondage was the circling sky
<P>
One mighty flat undwarfed by bush and tree <BR>
Spread its faint shadow of immensity <BR>
And lost itself, which seemed to eke its bounds <BR>
In the blue mist the horizon's edge surrounds
<P>
Now this sweet vision of my boyish hours <BR>
Free as spring clouds and wild as summer flowers <BR>
Is faded all - a hope that blossomed free, <BR>
And hath been once, no more shall ever be
<P>
Inclosure came and trampled on the grave <BR>
Of labour's rights and left the poor a slave <BR>
And memory's pride ere want to wealth did bow <BR>
Is both the shadow and the substance now
<P>
The sheep and cows were free to range as then <BR>
Where change might prompt nor felt the bonds of men <BR>
Cows went and came, with evening morn and night, <BR>
To the wild pasture as their common right
<P>
And sheep, unfolded with the rising sun <BR>
Heard the swains shout and felt their freedom won <BR>
Tracked the red fallow field and heath and plain <BR>
Then met the brook and drank and roamed again
<P>
The brook that dribbled on as clear as glass <BR>
Beneath the roots they hid among the grass <BR>
While the glad shepherd traced their tracks along <BR>
Free as the lark and happy as her song
<P>
But now all's fled and flats of many a dye <BR>
That seemed to lengthen with the following eye<BR>
Moors, loosing from the sight, far, smooth, and blea<BR>
Where swopt the plover in its pleasure free <BR>
Are vanished now with commons wild and gay <BR>
As poet's visions of life's early day
<P>
Mulberry-bushes where the boy would run <BR>
To fill his hands with fruit are grubbed and done <BR>
And hedgrow-briars - flower-lovers overjoyed <BR>
Came and got flower-pots - these are all destroyed
<P>
And sky-bound mores in mangled garbs are left <BR>
Like mighty giants of their limbs bereft
<P>
Fence now meets fence in owners' little bounds <BR>
Of field and meadow large as garden grounds <BR>
In little parcels little minds to please <BR>
With men and flocks imprisoned, ill at ease
<P>
Each little path that led its pleasant way <BR>
As sweet as morning leading night astray <BR>
Where little flowers bloomed round a varied host <BR>
That travel felt delighted to be lost
<P>
Nor grudged the steps that he had ta-en as vain <BR>
When right roads traced his journeys and again - <BR>
Nay, on a broken tree he'd sit awhile <BR>
To see the mores and fields and meadows smile
<P>
Sometimes with cowslaps smothered - then all white <BR>
With daiseys - then the summer's splendid sight <BR>
Of cornfields crimson o'er the headache bloomd <BR>
Like splendid armys for the battle plumed
<P>
He gazed upon them with wild fancy's eye <BR>
As fallen landscapes from an evening sky
<P>
These paths are stopt - the rude philistine's thrall <BR>
Is laid upon them and destroyed them all
<P>
Each little tyrant with his little sign <BR>
Shows where man claims earth glows no more divine
<P>
But paths to freedom and to childhood dear <BR>
A board sticks up to notice 'no road here'
<P>
And on the tree with ivy overhung <BR>
The hated sign by vulgar taste is hung <BR>
As tho' the very birds should learn to know <BR>
When they go there they must no further go
<P>
Thus, with the poor, scared freedom bade goodbye <BR>
And much they feel it in the smothered sigh <BR>
And birds and trees and flowers without a name <BR>
All sighed when lawless law's enclosure came
<P>
And dreams of plunder in such rebel schemes <BR>

Here is the righteous law; man wilt thou it maintain?<BR>
It may be, is, as hath still, in the world been slain. <BR>
Truth appears in light, falsehood rules in power; <BR>
To see these things to be is cause of grief each hour.
<P>
Knowledge, why didst thou comes to wound and not to cure?<BR>
I sent not for thee, thou didst me inlure.<BR>
Where knowledge does increase, there sorrows multiply, <BR>
To see the great deceit which in the world doth lie:
<P>
Man saying one thing now, unsaying it anon,<BR>
Breaking all&#146;s engagements, when deeds for him are done. <BR>
O power where art thou, that must mend things amiss?<BR>
Come change the heart of man, and make him truth to kiss.
<P>
O death where art thou? Wilt thou not tidings send?<BR>
I fear thee not, thou art my loving friend.<BR>
Come take this body, and scatter it in the four, <BR>
That I may dwell in one, and rest in peace once more.

  John Papworth (of Maida Vale)'s Millennium Prayer
</H2>
<P>
Lord make me an instrument of the war against evil,<BR>
Where there is vandalism against Thy creation<BR>
Let me campaign to stop it,<BR>
Where there is sabotage of Thy genetic ordainings,<BR>
Let me fight like hell to prevent it.
<P>
Where there is conspiracy to dominate Thy world with boardroom greed,<BR>
Let me join with others to wage an unremitting struggle to oppose it.<BR>
Where giant political forces combine with money makers and pocket liners<BR>
to assume control of community concerns such as education, health,<BR>
commerce, banks, law and order and work,<BR>
Let me be quick to affirm the overriding need for such matters to be
restored<BR>
to local community life so that Thy moral laws may prevail.
<P>
Where there is passivity, deference and conformism to the powers of <BR>
darkness which are degrading society and its individual members, let me be
<BR>
a powerful witness to oppose them.
<P>
Divine master, grant that I may not so much seek to live a quiet life as
to be <BR>
in the vanguard of those who would enhance life, not so much to grab as to<BR>
give, not to evade my social obligations as to shoulder them, not to be
afraid<BR>
of power as to be imbued with courage with others to control it for worthy
ends.
<P>
For it is in striving to act with love that we affirm love, and in devoting
ourselves to noble causes we are redeemed, and in giving ourselves utterly
to the service of truth, love and beauty in shared, fully democratic communities
we rise to the life immortal.

  OLD ENGLAND
</H2>
<H4>
  by G.A. Studdert Kennedy - otherwise known a "Woodbine Willie"<BR>
  from his collection 'The Unutterable Beauty', First World War poems
</H4>
<P>
Yes, I'm fightin' for old England<BR>
And for eighteenpence a day,
<P>
And I'm fightin' like an 'ero,<BR>
So the daily papers say.
<P>
Well, I ain't no downy chicken,<BR>
I'm a bloke past forty-three,
<P>
And I'm goin' to tell ye honest<BR>
What old England means to me.
<P>
When I joined the British Army<BR>
I'd bin workin' thirty years,
<P>
But I left my bloomin' rent-book<BR>
Showin' three months in arrears.
<P>
No, I weren't no chronic boozer,<BR>
Nor I weren't a lad to bet;
<P>
I worked 'ard when I could get it,<BR>
And I weren't afeared to sweat.
<P>
But I weren't a tradesman proper,<BR>
And the work were oft to seek,
<P>
So the most I could addle<BR>
Were abaht a quid a week.
<P>
And when me and Jane got married,<BR>
And we 'ad our oldest kid,
<P>
We soon learned 'ow many shillings<BR>
Go to make a golden quid.
<P>
For we 'ad to keep our clubs up,<BR>
And there's three and six for rent,
<P>
And with food and boots and clothing<BR>
It no sooner came than went.
<P>
Then when kiddies kep' on comin'-<BR>
We reared four and buried three;
<P>
My ole woman couldn't do it,<BR>
So we got in debt - ye see.
<P>
And we 'ad a 'eap o' sickness<BR>
And we got struck off the club,
<P>
With our little lot o' troubles<BR>
We just couldn't pay the sub.
<P>
No, I won't tell you no false'oods;<BR>
There were times I felt that queer,
<P>
That I went and did the dirty,<BR>
And 'ad a drop o' beer.
<P>
Then the wife and me 'ud quarrel,<BR>
And our 'ome were little 'ell,
<P>
Wiv the 'ungry kiddies cryin',<BR>
Till I eased up for a spell.
<P>
There were times when it were better,<BR>
There were times when it were worse,
<P>
But to make it altogether,<BR>
My old England were a curse.
<P>
It were sleepin', sweatin', starvin',<BR>
Wearing boot soles for a job,
<P>
It were sucking up to foremen<BR>
What 'ud sell ye for a bob.
<P>
It were cringin', crawlin', whinin',<BR>
For the right to earn your bread,
<P>
It were schemin', pinchin', plannin',<BR>
It were wishin' ye was dead.
<P>
I'm not fightin' for old England,<BR>
Not for this child - am I? 'Ell!
<P>
For the sake o' that old England<BR>
I'd not face a single shell,
<P>
Not a single bloomin' whizzbang.<BR>
Never mind this blarsted show,
<P>
With your comrades fallin' round ye,<BR>
Lyin' bleedin' in a row.
<P>
This ain't war, it's ruddy murder, <BR>
It's a stinkin' slaughter 'ouse.
<P>
'Ark to that one, if 'e got ye<BR>
'E'd just squash ye like this louse.
<P>
Would I do this for old England,<BR>
Would I? 'Ell, I says, not me!
<P>
What I says is, sink old England,<BR>
To the bottom of the sea!
<P>
It's new England as I fights for,<BR>
It's an England swep' aht clean,
<P>
It's an England where we'll get at<BR>
Things our eyes 'ave never seen;
<P>
Decent wages, justice, mercy,<BR>
And a chance for ev'ry man
<P>
For to make 'is 'ome an 'eaven<BR>
If 'e does the best 'e can.
<P>
It's that better, cleaner England,<BR>
Made 'o better, cleaner men,
<P>
It's that England as I fights for,<BR>
And I'm game to fight again.
<P>
It's the better land o' Blighty<BR>
That still shines afore our eyes,
<P>
That's the land a soldier fights for,<BR>
And for that a soldier dies.

</H3>
<H4>
  Have you ever noticed that personal post that is not a bank statement or
  junk mail doesn't appear to arrive on a Monday morning? Have you ever wondered
  why? Have you ever realised the spooks that open our mail don't work at the
  weekend? If so, you, like me, may have been a victim of postal interception.
</H4>
<H4>
  As if that's not bad enough did you know that Deutche Bank, the German national
  bank, is using its unlimited cash resources to buy up all the postal systems
  in Europe, they also have their heavy artillery aimed at Britain's privatised
  Royal Mail?
</H4>
<P>
In what appears to be a crude attempt at intimidation my post has been
selectively intercepted/delayed/opened (at least up to September 2001) and
may even be stolen in transit. Contact me, if you wish, after a reasonable
period of time to confirm delivery of specific items. If anything disappears
I can then pursue the matter with the appropriate UK authorities but I need
to know when and where post has been sent from as well as details of contents.
Please obtain a free 'proof of posting' slip from your local post office
if you send me anything of value that you think might go astray.

<OL>
  <LI>
    It is quite worrying and depressing to see corruptions of the poem, purporting
    to be Niemoeller's original, beginning 'First they came for the Jews...'
    the rounding up of Jews happened towards the end of World War II and was,
    of course, Hitler's 'Final Solution' not 'First' at all.
  <LI>
    What that famous and moving quotation does not mention is that before they
    came for the Communists, they came for the homeless, the mentally disabled,
    the unemployed, and all those categorized as "asocial." (from McSpotlight
    site:
    <A TARGET="_new" HREF="http://194.109.5.47/media/press/bioticbb_24feb99.html">http://194.109.5.47/media/press/bioticbb_24feb99.html</A>
    )
  <LI>
    Once upon a time in Germany the Nazis rounded up citizens and murdered them.
    Other German citizens were so frightened by the Nazis they pretended not
    to see what was happening to their neighbors. Is the press in your country
    so frightened by the Elite your journalists and photo-journalists have become
    a group of "Not-Sees."? Or, are your journalists and photo-journalists "Not-Sees"
    because they can make more money being dishonest then they can from being
    honest? see 2 Peter 2:1 <A HREF="mailto:roundtable@geocities.com">roundtable

Note from "Till Mueller-Schoell" &lt;schoellermuell (at) yahoo.com&gt; September
2004 - Hello Tony, On the Niemoeller-Poem, you write: "What that famous and
moving quotation does not mention is that before they came for the Communists,
they came for the homeless, the mentally disabled, the unemployed, and all
those categorized as 'asocial.'" This is a strange competition, isn't it?
<P>
1) Organised Murder of the mentally disabled started in 1939.
<P>
2) Organised Murder of the Jews started in 1941 with the war against the
SU. Repressions earlier, but usually without camps.
<P>
3) Communists (all MPs and leading members) were imprisoned in Concentration
Camps in 1933, but they were not killed at once.
<P>
4) Organised Murder of Sinti and Roma ('asocial' in nazi-terms) started in
1942, but imprisonment and repression were intense from 1938 on and had a
tradition long before the Nazi-Regime.
