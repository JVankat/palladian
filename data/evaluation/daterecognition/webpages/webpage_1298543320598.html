Field of the Invention<br /><br />The present invention relates in general to a method and apparatus for making secure a hydraulic gang connector in remote or hazardous locations. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for the simultaneous connectionand disconnection of multiple male and female couplers to provide sealed conduits for subsea operations.<br /><br />2. Description of the Related Art<br /><br />Subsea oil and gas production equipment that requires the use of external signals or the supply of fluids for operation is normally connected subsea after installation with interconnecting cables, jumpers, or umbilicals having removableconnectors on each end. Remotely Operated Vehicles ("ROVs") are normally used to connect the removable (outboard) connector to the fixed (inboard) connector on the subsea equipment. Due to operational conditions (such as ROV size and strength, weightof connectors, ocean currents and drag induced by pulling the cables across the seafloor), proper alignment of the removable and fixed connectors can be difficult and time consuming, and improper alignment can damage the components of the fixed and/orremovable connectors.<br /><br />There are three important aspects of connector design: alignment, latching and protection of components. The first requirement (alignment) is to get the fixed and removable connectors aligned quickly and accurately. The second requirement(latching) is to latch the fixed and removable connectors together such that they form a watertight seal with each other. The third requirement (protection) is to protect tubing and other components during storage, handling, transport and installationoperations.<br /><br />There are many alignment schemes currently used in subsea operations. A typical method is to insert a stepped pin into a cylinder having a leading chamfer. As the pin enters the cylindrical receptacle at some entry angle, the pin generates aforce that causes it to align with the receptacle. Two pins are required to get alignment in two planes.<br /><br />Another alignment method used is a cylinder with a symmetrical, outwardly expanding internal notch having 180 degree helical sides extending to its opening end such that a comating pin having a complementary radially outwardly projecting helix,round pin, or other protrusion may be inserted. Engagement of the female helical surface with the male helical surface, the pin, or the can provide up to 180 degrees of rotational alignment in either direction, but the mechanism is long and requires ahigh axial force to achieve alignment.<br /><br />There are also many latching methods in use for securing the removable connector to the fixed connector. The removable connector is normally carried and installed by the ROV with the use of an industry standard torque tool and a flying leadorientation tool ("FLOT"). The usage of the torque tool as a standard practice requires the connector designs to include some kind of threads. The earliest methods relied on remotely engaging a male and female thread subsea and required much care notto cross-thread the connection. Cross-threading usually requires retrieval of the subsea equipment to repair the damaged thread on the fixed connector.<br /><br />A preferred latching method is to use permanently engaged threads on the removable connector with a latching profile that engages the fixed connector. One type of profile currently used is a collet latching onto a fixed hub. This is a commonmethod for making large diameter connections for use in pipelines and wellheads. This concept is compact and works well to pull the halves together but when the operation takes place in deep water where the force to separate the plates is large, thefingers of the collet are susceptible to buckling. The override of this type of connector requires the use of a hydraulic ram to pull a sleeve that captures the collet back thus releasing the collet.<br /><br />In 1982, Exxon patented (U.S. Pat. No. 4,362,413) a method in which the threads are permanently engaged. This method relied on inserting a nut with an external profile into a receptacle and turning the nut 90 degrees until a mechanical stopprevented the nut from rotating any further and restrained the nut axially. A disadvantage to this concept is that the size of the receptacle used in the connector relative to the thread size is not very efficient for designs concerned with size andweight.<br /><br />Two other concepts that are similar to the Exxon patent are the Oceaneering patent by Cunningham (U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,701) and the pending Subsea 7 patent by Glennie (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/477,088) that is in Re-Examination. The Oceaneering patent discloses a specific configuration of components based on the engagement of a receptacle on the fixed connector and a stud with lugs or profiles on the removable connector. The Subsea 7 patent application is based on the sameconcept but also covers an override feature utilizing shear pins.<br /><br />A similar latching mechanism is also used by Intec Engineering, which is based on the Retlock concept acquired from Fuel Subsea. The Intec Engineering system is the DMAC or Diverless Maintained Cluster that is also marketed by Subsea 7.<br /><br />Bayonet-type latching systems have the latch pin mounted on the face of the removable connector and the latch sleeve mounted in the fixed connector. This design leaves the latch pin exposed to damage from storage, handling, transport andinstallation of the removable connector.<br /><br />All of the above-described designs leave the tubing exposed to damage from handling and ROV operations, are susceptible to thread damage and are difficult to align, thereby increasing the probability of damaged tubing or other components duringinstallation.<br /><br />There exists a need for an apparatus and method that provides both a coarse alignment and a fine alignment that is easy and quick to execute.<br /><br />There is a further need to provide a connector with an apparatus and method of latching the parts of the connector together without the need for engaging threads subsea.<br /><br />Furthermore, a need exists for providing a connector design that provides the desired alignment and latching characteristics, while providing a protection mechanism for the tubing, latching system and other components of the subsea connectorsystem.<br /><br />SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br /><br />The present invention relates in general to a method and apparatus for making secure connections in remote or hazardous locations. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for the connection of male and female gangcouplers to provide sealed conduits for subsea operations.<br /><br />One aspect of the present invention is a selectably engagable and disengagable subsea connector system for mating a plurality of mutually comateable male and female couplers located within fixed and removable connectors of a subsea connectorsystem to provide a plurality of sealed conduits.

The subsea connector system 100 is especiallyapplicable for use with stiff cables and bundles of tubes that are difficult to align subsea with ROVs.<br /><br />For ease of understanding, all examples and drawings assume a vertical orientation with the fixed connector the upper connector. The above-described use and orientation are meant by way of example and are not intended to limit the scope of theinvention. The system also can be used for connecting a removable outboard connector and a removable inboard connector (not shown). Typically, the components of the connector system 100 are preferably made of carbon or stainless steel for thestructural parts and rubber such as Viton™ or nitrile for the elastomeric seals.<br /><br />Removable (Outboard) and Fixed (Inboard) Housings<br /><br />FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate the overall geometry of the removable and fixed connectors 200 and 300, respectively, that provides novel alignment characteristics for the subsea connector system 100. An outboard (removable) connector housing 210 issymmetrical about its two principle perpendicular planes and includes a larger square cross-section tube 211, a smaller square tube 213, and a square cross-section truncated reducing pyramidal tube 212 interconnecting the tubes 211 and 213 so that theresultant tubular structure has the same wall thickness throughout smoothly interconnecting adjoining surfaces 211, 212, and 213.<br /><br />The sections of the removable connector housing 210 are all coaxial. The exterior horizontal edges of the top of the smaller tube 213 are liberally rounded with radius 264 to ease misaligned stabbing of the removable connector 200 into theinterior of fixed connector 300.<br /><br />At the lower end of the removable connector housing is located a symmetrical externally projecting transverse end flange 218 of constant width which has a regularly spaced pattern of mounting bolt holes 219 parallel to the axis of symmetry of thehousing 210. The removable connector housing 210 also has a symmetrical inwardly projecting transverse interior flange 216 of constant width for the mounting of a tool guide 230 positioned upwardly from the lower end of the housing 210. The interiorflange 216 has a regularly spaced pattern of mounting bolt holes parallel to the axis of symmetry of the housing 210.<br /><br />Spaced slightly below its upper end in smaller tube 213, housing 210 has a regular pattern of multiple countersunk holes for flathead screws 205 normal to its axis of symmetry. Removable connector housing 210 houses symmetrical removabletransverse end plate 260 with a slip fit at its upper end. Flathead screws 205 engaged through the countersunk hole pattern and engaged in the tapped holes 265 of transverse end plate 260 serve to rigidly mount that plate.<br /><br />Spaced downwardly from the upper end of housing 210 and slightly above the lower end of the smaller square tube 213 is a second pattern of countersunk holes for flathead screws identical to the pattern at the upper end of the housing. Interiorof this portion of smaller tube 213, square latch assembly mounting plate 270 is mounted transversely to the axis of housing 210 by means of a set of screws 205 engaged the second pattern of countersunk holes and the threaded mounting holes 275 in plate270.<br /><br />FIG. 1 illustrates the various access apertures in the housing 210 of the removable connector 200. Access apertures in the removable housing 210 include two sets of rectangular coupler access holes: lower 215 and upper 217. These access holes215 and 217 are symmetrically placed in each side of the removable housing 210. The upper access apertures 217 are also used to access the latching mechanism. Additionally, there is an alignment key 209 provided on a vertical plane of symmetry on oneside of larger tube 211. One embodiment of the alignment key 209 has a rectangular cross-section, external bevels on its upper end, and is mounted to tube 211 by welding. The lower end of key 209 abuts the upper side of mounting flange 218.<br /><br />Tool guide 230 consists of a transverse square mounting plate 231 that has a centrally located vertical right circular cylindrical guide sleeve 233 extending upwardly. A through hole matching the inner diameter of the guide sleeve 233 is cut inthe middle of the mounting plate 231. The inner diameter of the guide sleeve 233 offers a close slip fit to the end of a commercially available wrenching device inserted from below (not shown), so that the wrenching device can be maintained concentricwith the vertical axis of the tool guide and hence with the axis of symmetry of the removable connector 200. This concentricity eases the engagement of the wrenching device with the square profile wrench flats 221 on the bottom end of the drive screw220 of the removable side latching components 151. Mounting plate 231 also has a regular pattern of peripheral bolt holes corresponding to the mounting holes in the interiorly extending flange 216 of removable housing 210, thereby permitting the toolguide 230 to be mounted on the lower side of flange 216 by bolt and nut sets 214.<br /><br />In the event that a wrenching device requiring torque reaction points is to be employed to effect the operation of the latching system 150, such as a ROV torque tool, the upper end of the tool guide 230 can be modified. In such a case, the upperend of tool guide 230 is provided with an integral transverse upper end diaphragm having a central hole to permit extension therethrough of the wrenching socket of the wrenching device. Two diametrically opposed equidiameter reaction pin through holesparallel to and equally offset from the central hole axis of the diaphragm are then provided in order to engage corresponding pins mounted on the end of the ROV torque tool (not shown).<br /><br />As seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the fixed connector housing 310 of fixed connector 300 is structurally similar to removable connector housing 210, but it is made slightly larger so that it has a slip fit over the exterior of housing 210. Fixedconnector housing 310 is symmetrical about its two principal perpendicular planes and includes a larger square cross-section tube 313, a smaller square tube 315 and a square cross-section truncated reducing pyramidal tube 314 interconnecting the tubes313 and 315 so that the resultant tubular structure has the same wall thickness throughout smoothly interconnecting adjoining surfaces 313, 314, and 315 except at the top of housing 310. The sections of the fixed connector housing 310 are all coaxial.<br /><br />At the lower end of the fixed connector housing 310 is located a symmetrical externally projecting transverse end flange 340 of constant width which has a regularly spaced pattern of mounting bolt holes 341 parallel to the axis of symmetry of thehousing 310. Adjacent the top of housing 310, the wall thickness of small tube 315 is locally increased to the inside so that it offers a slip fit to the transverse sides of the fixed end plate 320. This is done so that the size of the squares of thefixed and removable end plates 320 and 260, respectively, is the same.<br /><br />Spaced slightly below its upper end in smaller tube 315, housing 310 has a regular pattern of multiple countersunk holes for flathead screws 205 normal to its axis of symmetry. Fixed connector housing 310 houses symmetrical square fixedtransverse end plate 320 with a slip fit at its upper end. Flathead screws 205 engaged through the countersunk hole pattern and engaged in the tapped holes 325 of transverse fixed end plate 320 serve to rigidly mount that plate. FIG. 1 illustrates thesymmetrically placed rectangular access apertures 316 in each face of smaller tube 315 of the housing 310 of the fixed connector 300. The access apertures 316 are used to access the latching mechanism and the male hydraulic couplings 430. Apertures 316in the fixed housing 310 also provide an outlet for seawater, as the removable connector 200 is inserted further into the fixed connector 300.<br /><br />Additionally, there is an alignment slot 309 provided on a vertical plane of symmetry on one side of larger tube 313. Slot 309 has a rectangular cross-section, external bevels on its lower end, and is cut into tube 313. The lower end of slot309 penetrates the mounting flange 340. Slot 309 is engageable with key 209 and together the interaction of the two when the removable 200 and fixed 300 connectors are assembled together axially ensures that the connectors are properly engaged.<br /><br />Male and Female Coupling Sets 400<br /><br />Illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 are male and female couplings 430 and 401, which together constitute a latchless quick connect coupling system 400. Such quick connect couplings are commercially available for use in externally latched gangconnections. The Staubli Corporation and others offer typical examples of such commercial products. Female coupling 401 has a body 402 composed of right circular cylindrical tubular sections.<br /><br />The cylindrical exterior of body 402 of female coupling 401 has, from its upper sealing engagement first end (shown on the righthand side in FIGS. 6 and 7) two snap ring grooves that are spaced apart sufficiently to admit end plate 260 ofremovable connector 200 and, at its lower end, a symmetrical hexagonal pattern of wrench flats. External snap rings 417 are engageable in the snap ring grooves to retain female coupling 401 in mounting holes of end plate 260. The interior of body 402has, from its first end, a counterbore 420 with a female O-ring groove containing O-ring 411, a through bore with a female O-ring groove containing O-ring 410, a frustroconical abutting surface to limiting coupling poppet travel, and a downwardly openingcounterbore with a snap ring groove containing internal snap ring 415 and, finally, a female sealing thread.<br /><br />Brazeable tube fitting 405 is threadedly engaged and seals into the female thread at the lower end of female coupling 401. The exterior of brazeable connector 405 has, from its upper end, a male sealing thread, a symmetrical hexagonal transverseflange which provides wrenching flats, and a reduced diameter neck. The connector 405 has a concentric through bore with a downwardly opening counterbore that is a close fit to hydraulic tube 406. Brazeable connector 405 and hydraulic tube 406 aretypically assembled by brazing. However, compression fittings can alternatively be used for the interconnection of connector 405 and tube 406.<br /><br />Female poppet 403 is symmetrical about its vertical axis and in mounted in the interior of body 402 so that its upward end projects above the upper end of body 402. The exterior of poppet 403 has, from its upper end, a first cylindrical contactsection, a reduced diameter extension neck, an enlarged sealing cylinder, an enlarged frustroconical abutment shoulder, and a main cylindrical body section. The first cylindrical contact section is a slip fit through the main bore of the body 402, whilethe sealing cylinder section is a slip fit to the main bore of the body 402 and is sealed against O-ring 410 when the two are adjacent. The lower end of the poppet 403 is a slip fit to the lower counterbore of the body 402. The lower end of poppet 403is bored with a conical bore end so that the wall thickness of poppet 403 at the abutment shoulder is relative thin. Multiple flow passages with their axes inclined to and intercepting the poppet longitudinal axis provide a flow path between theinterior and exterior of the poppet.<br /><br />A flat washer 416 is a close fit to the lower counterbore of body 402 and abuts the upper side of snap ring 415. Compression spring 418 abuts both the upper side of washer 416 and the interior shoulder of the bore of poppet 403, thereby biasingpoppet 403 against the downwardly facing abutting surface of body 402.<br /><br />The body 431 of male coupling 430 is composed of right circular cylindrical tubular sections. The cylindrical exterior of body 431 has, from its lower sealing engagement first end (shown on the lefthand side in FIGS. 6 and 7) a large bevel foreasing sealing engagement with O-ring 411, a reduced diameter sealing surface which is a slip fit into the female socket 420 of body 402 and sealable against O-ring 411, an enlarged main cylindrical body section having two snap ring grooves which arespaced apart sufficiently to admit end plate 320 of fixed connector 300 and, at its upper end, a symmetrical hexagonal pattern of wrench flats.<br /><br />External snap rings 417 are engageable in the snap ring grooves to retain male coupling 430 in mounting holes 322 of end plate 320. The interior of body 431 has, from its lower end, a through bore through which the contact end of poppet 403 ofthe female connector 401 can pass, a frustroconical abutting surface to limiting coupling poppet travel, and a upwardly opening counterbore with a snap ring groove containing internal snap ring 436 and, finally, a female sealing thread. Anotherbrazeable tube fitting 405 with attached hydraulic tubing 406 is sealing engaged in the female thread at the upper end of body 431.<br /><br />Male connector poppet 432 has, from its lower end, a sealing cylindrical section with a centrally located male O-ring groove containing O-ring 433, an enlarged frustroconical abutting shoulder, and a cylindrical upper section. The sealingcylindrical contact section is a slip fit through the main bore of the body 431 and is sealed against O-ring 433 when the two are adjacent. The upper end of the poppet 432 is a slip fit to the counterbore of the body 431. Similarly to poppet 403 of thefemale coupling 401, poppet 432 has a coaxial bore with a conical bore end on its upper end and extending sufficiently far into the body of poppet 432 that the wall of the poppet is relatively thin in the region of its abutting shoulder. Multiple flowpassages with their axes inclined to and intercepting the poppet longitudinal axis provide a flow path between the interior and exterior of the poppet 432. A flat washer 437 is a close fit to the upper counterbore of body 431 and abuts the upper side ofsnap ring 436. Compression spring 438 abuts both the upper side of washer 436 and the interior shoulder of the bore of poppet 432, thereby biasing poppet 432 against the upwardly facing abutting surface of body 431.<br /><br />FIG. 2 is a vertical longitudinal cross-sectional view of the fully mated removable connector 200 and fixed connector 300. FIG. 2 illustrates the geometry of the removable housing 210 and the fixed housing 310, along with their internallymounted components of the latching system 150. The components of the latching system 150 are grouped into removable side latching components 151 and fixed side latching components 152. The removable side latching components 151, shown most clearly inFIGS. 3 and 9, along with the exploded FIG. 12, include a latch assembly mounting plate 270, a drive screw 220, a camming sleeve 240, the latch sleeve 250 and female couplers 401 mounted on the removable end plate 260. The components of the fixed sidelatching components 152, shown best in FIGS. 3 and 9 and exploded FIG. 8, include fixed end plate 320, latch pin 330, latch pin hex nut 335, and key 339, along with male couplings 430.<br /><br />Removable Side Latching Components 151<br /><br />In FIGS. 1, 3, and 9, the square removable end plate 260 of the preferred embodiment of the removable connector 200 is shown with a plurality of circular coupling mounting holes for installation of female couplers 401. The female couplings 401are retained in the holes by means of external snap rings 417, as shown in FIG. 4. Holes are positioned in a regular pattern with closely held position tolerances.<br /><br />Also shown is the central latch sleeve hole 263 for maintaining the position of the latch sleeve 250 on the axis of the removable connector 200. The end plate 260 has any number of mounting holes for any number of female couplings 401. Theembodiment shown in FIG. 1 having twelve female couplings is meant by way of example and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br /><br />Removable transverse end plate 260 has a regular pattern of horizontal axis drilled and tapped holes 265 at its horizontal midplane corresponding to the countersunk holes at the upper end of housing 210 around its periphery. A flathead screw 205extending through each of the transverse holes in the upper end of housing 210 and threadedly engaged in a mating hole 265 is used to rigidly mount removable transverse end plate 260 to housing 210.<br /><br />FIGS. 2, 3, 9, and 12 show the square latch assembly mounting plate 270 of the preferred embodiment of the removable side latching components 151 with a plurality of circular clearance holes 278 for passage of each of the hydraulic tubes 406 usedwith the removable connector 200. Holes 278 are positioned in a regular pattern corresponding to that of the holes in the removable end plate 260. Centrally positioned on the axis of symmetry in the latch assembly mounting plate is the central latchsleeve support hole 279 for maintaining the position of the screw support sleeve 271 on the axis of the removable connector 200. Symmetrical transverse latch assembly mounting plate 270 has a slip fit in the interior of smaller tube section 213 ofremovable housing 210 and has a regular pattern of horizontal axis drilled and tapped holes 275 corresponding to those at the lower end of tube 213 around its periphery on its horizontal midplane. A flathead screw 205 extending through each of thetransverse holes in the lower end of housing 213 and threadedly engaged in a mating hole 275 is used to rigidly mount latch assembly mounting plate 270 to housing 210.<br /><br />Screw support sleeve 271 is a right circular cylindrical tube with a outwardly extending transverse flange at its lower end. Sleeve 271 is inserted from below through the latch sleeve support hole 279 in latch assembly mounting plate 270 so thatthe upper side of its flange abuts the underside of the plate 270. Fillet weld 272 around the upper periphery of the flange of sleeve 271 is used to rigidly mount the sleeve to the latch assembly mounting plate 270. Near the upper end of screw supportsleeve is located a horizontal drilled and tapped radial camming pin hole 276. As shown here, the axis of the radial camming pin hole 276 is inclined 45 degrees to the vertical sides of the latch assembly mounting plate 270. Camming pin 228 has malethreads at its inner first end, a smooth shank, and an Allen wrench pocket on its outer end. Camming pin 228 is threadedly engaged in the camming pin hole 276 after assembly of the camming sleeve 240 onto the screw support sleeve with its camminggrooves 241 and 242 positioned over the camming pin hole 276.<br /><br />FIGS. 9, 10, and 11 show the installed drive screw 220 in section, while FIG. 12 shows an oblique view of the drive screw. An industry-standard square profile 221 forms the wrench flats 221 at the bottom of the drive screw 220 for engagement bya wrenching device, such as a ROV torque tool, during the latching operation. Immediately above the wrench flats 221 is a transverse right circular cylindrical flange shoulder 222 that abuts the flange of the screw support sleeve 271 when the drivescrew is inserted into the bore of the sleeve 271.<br /><br />The upwardly extending round shaft of the drive screw has, from the upper side of the shoulder 222, a bearing surface 229 which is a slip fit to the through bore of the screw support sleeve 271, an extended undercut cylindrical shank, anotherbearing surface 229, a small transverse shoulder, slightly reduced diameter lefthand threads 224 for engagement of the keeper sleeve 223, a reduced diameter extended thread relief groove, and an extended section of righthand threads 225 for engaging thelatch sleeve 250. The diameter of the righthand threads 225 is less than that of the lefthand threads 224.<br /><br />The keeper sleeve 223 is a short right circular cylindrical tube having lefthand internal threads 226, a short transverse upper flange, and multiple tapped radial set screw holes at the midheight of the upper flange. The lefthand internalthreads 226 are comateable with the threads 224 of the drive screw 220. At assembly of the removable side latching components 151, drive screw 220 is inserted through the bore of the screw support sleeve 271 from below and then keeper sleeve 223 screwedonto the lefthand threads 224 so that the lower transverse shoulder of the keeper sleeve abuts the upper transverse end of the screw support sleeve 271. Allen head set screws 227 are installed in the radial set screw holes of the keeper sleeve 223 andare screwed in at assembly to abut the cylindrical surface of the long thread relief of the drive screw 220 and thereby prevent relative movement of the keeper sleeve 223 and the drive screw. In this manner drive screw 220 is axially restrained in bothdirections by the shoulder 222 on the bottom and the keeper sleeve 223 on the top.<br /><br />The camming sleeve 240, shown best in FIG. 12, is a right circular cylindrical tube containing multiple radial holes 243 adjacent its upper end for connection to the latch sleeve 250 by shearable threaded pins 244. The bore of the camming sleeve240 is a slip fit to both the upper exterior of the screw support sleeve 271 and the reduced diameter lower end 255 of the latch sleeve 250.<br /><br />Near the lower end of camming sleeve 240 is a high pitch radially cut helical rotation groove 241. In plan view, the angle between the start and finish of the helical rotation groove 241 is about 45 degrees. At its upper end, groove 241smoothly intersects radially cut axially extending axial travel groove 242, which is centrally located in the length of the sleeve 240. When assembled over the upwardly extending screw support sleeve 271, the two intersecting camming reaction grooves241 and 242 of camming sleeve 240 are engageable by the camming pin 228 projecting outwardly from the outer surface of the screw support sleeve 271. Together, the interaction of pin 228 with the intersecting grooves 241 and 242 limit the range ofrotational motion of the camming sleeve 240 and its attached latch sleeve 250 about the vertical axis of the rigidly mounted screw support sleeve 271 to about forty-five degrees while in the first groove 241, while allowing only axial reciprocatorymovement of the camming sleeve and latch sleeve relative to the removable connector 200.<br /><br />FIG. 12 shows an oblique view, while FIGS. 14 and 15 respectively show end and longitudinal cross-sectional views of the latch sleeve 250. Latch sleeve 250 is composed of integral right circular cylindrical tubular sections. When mounted in itsoperating position as shown in FIG. 2, the upper exterior cylindrical surface of latch sleeve 250 is a sliding fit to the center mounting hole 263 of the removable end plate 260. At the lower exterior end of latch sleeve 250, reduced diameter lower end255 is located, with a transverse shoulder adjoining lower end 255 and the main body of the sleeve. Reduced diameter lower end 255 is a close slip fit to the upper interior end of the camming sleeve 240. Multiple radial drilled and tapped holes 251 arepositioned adjacent the lower end of latch sleeve 250 in a pattern matching the holes 243 of the camming sleeve 240 when the upper end of the camming sleeve is abutted against the downwardly facing transverse shoulder at the upper end of the reduceddiameter lower end 255. At assembly, the vertical plane of the camming sleeve 240 which contains both its axial travel groove 242 and its longitudinal axis is aligned with the vertical plane of symmetry of the female splines or clearance slots 254 ofthe latch sleeve 250.<br /><br />From its lower end, as seen in FIG. 15, the interior of latch sleeve 250 has a section of unthreaded axial hole 257, righthand internal threads 252, an upwardly facing internal shoulder, an enlarged internal cavity 256, a downwardly facingfrustroconical latching shoulder 253, and a clearance hole 258 which is a slip fit to the shank of the latch pin 330. The unthreaded axial hole 257 freely passes threads 225 of the drive screw 220, while the threads 252 are engageable with the threads225. The interior diameter of the cavity 256 has a slip fit with the outer cylindrical surface of the male splines or latch dogs 331 of the latch pin 330 of the fixed side latching components 152. The latching shoulder 253 is closely engageable withthe comateable upwardly facing frustroconical surfaces of the latch dogs 331 of the latch pin 330.<br /><br />As shown in FIG. 14, multiple identical regularly spaced axially extending rectangular profile slots 254 extend from the upper end to the cavity 256 of the latch sleeve 250. The width of the female splines or clearance slots 254 is larger thanthe width of the male splines or latch dogs 331 of the latch pin 330. The outer wall of the slots 254 extends to the diameter of the cavity 256 and hence offers a loose clearance for the passage of the latch dogs 331, while the clearance hole 258 forthe shank of latch pin 330 permits passage of the main cylindrical body of the latch pin. Accordingly, when the male splines or latch dogs 331 are aligned with the female splines or slots 254, the latch pin 330 can enter the cavity 256 of the latchsleeve 250. After entry of pin 330 into the cavity 256, sufficient axial rotation of the latch sleeve 250 relative to the latch pin can prevent withdrawal of the latch pin. When the latch sleeve 250 is rotated 45 degrees relative to its stabbingposition, the latch dogs 331 are at their maximum misalignment with the slots 254 of the latch sleeve. The connection 100 may be drawn together safely when this rotation has been achieved.<br /><br />Note that adjusting the length of the cavity 256 and the length of the latch pin 330 can limit the relative axial travel during initial stabbing of the removable connector 200 and the fixed connector 300. In such a case, the lower end of thelatch pin would abut the upwardly facing shoulder at the lower end of the cavity 256. Use of such abutment can prevent communication between the male 430 and female 401 side of the coupling sets 400 until the removable side latching components 151 andthe fixed side latching components 152 are filly latched.<br /><br />Fixed Side Latching Components 152<br /><br />The square fixed end plate 320 of the preferred embodiment of the fixed connector 300 is shown with a plurality of circular coupling mounting holes 322 for installation of male couplers 430, as shown in the exploded view of FIG. 8. The malecouplings 430 are retained in the holes 322 by means of external snap rings 417, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.<br /><br />Holes 322 are positioned in a regular pattern with closely held position tolerances, with the hole pattern the same as the pattern of holes in the removable end plate 260. The configuration of the end plate 320 having mounting holes 322 fortwelve male couplings 430 is meant by way of example and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Also shown is the central hole 324 for mounting the downwardly extending latch pin 330. A rectangular cross-section keyway 326 is cut in aradial position on the edge of central hole 324.<br /><br />Fixed transverse end plate 320 has a regular pattern of horizontal axis drilled and tapped holes 325 at its horizontal midplane corresponding to the countersunk holes at the upper end of housing 310 around its periphery. A flathead screw 205extending through each of the transverse countersunk holes in the upper end of housing 310 and threadedly engaged in a mating hole 325 is used to rigidly mount fixed transverse end plate 320 to housing 310.<br /><br />Latch pin 330, shown in FIG. 8, is composed of integral generally right circular cylindrical segments. From its upper end, latch pin 330 has a male thread 334, a thread relief in which a rectangular cross-section keyway 332 is cut, a centralflange with transverse upper shoulder, and an extended cylindrical shank that has multiple equispaced discrete radially outwardly extending latch dogs 331. The upper and lower sides of each latch dog 331 are segments of frustroconical transitionshoulders, while the lateral sides of each individual latch dog are parallel and equally offset from the longitudinal axis of the latch pin 330.<br /><br />A rectangular cross-section key 339 is installed in the keyway of the latch pin 330 and the latch pin with its key are installed in the central hole 324 of the fixed transverse end plate 320 from below so that the key is also engaged with thekeyway 326 of the end plate. In this manner, the latch pin 330 is prevented from rotation relative to the end plate 320 and, hence, also the fixed connector 300. Note that the orientation of the keyways 326 and 332 are necessarily controlled so thatthe planes of symmetry of the latch dogs 331 of the installed latch pin 330 are parallel to the transverse sides of the fixed end plate 320. Internally threaded hex nut 335 is then threadedly connected to the threads 334 at the upper end of the latchpin 330 to fully rigidize the connection between the latch pin and the fixed end plate 320.<br /><br />OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br /><br />Prior to the use, the removable connector 200 is assembled as shown in FIG. 2. This involves structurally connecting (usually by welding although other methods are acceptable) the parts of the removable housing 210 (the large tube 211, thefrustrated pyramidal reducing tube 212 and the small tube 213) if such connections have not been done previously at manufacture, mounting the female couplings 401 (such as those manufactured by National Coupler) on the removable end plate 260, andattaching the removable end plate 260 to the upper end of the removable housing 210. Assembly continues with connecting the camming sleeve 240 and latch sleeve 250 with shearable camming sleeve mounting screws 244 in holes 243 and 251, slipping theslotted sleeve 240 over the screw support sleeve, and bolting the guide tube 230 to the mounting flange 216 of the removable housing 210. Assembly of the removable connector is completed by inserting the drive screw 220 into the downwardly facing end ofthe latch sleeve 250 and rotating the drive screw 220 such that its external righthand threads 225 fully engage with the internal threads 252 of the latch sleeve 250 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 9.<br /><br />During transport of the assembled removable connector 200 to the installation location, all sensitive components of the removable connector are inside of and, therefore, protected by the heavy-duty removable housing 210. If the installation isto be subsea, then the stabbing together of the fixed and removable connectors is done in an inverted position from that shown in the drawings for the present disclosure. In such a case, when the installation site is reached, an ROV (not shown)maneuvers the removable connector 200 of the preferred embodiment such that the top (in the drawings) of the removable connector 200 enters the bottom of the fixed connector 300. The use of an ROV is meant by way of example and is not meant to limit thescope of the invention. A diver, for instance, could perform the operation instead of an ROV.<br /><br />As shown in FIG. 13, a high degree of coarse, angular alignment of the connector system 100 is provided by taking advantage of the natural alignment properties of the geometrically similar housings 210 and 310 of the removable and fixedconnectors 200 and 300, respectively. The removable connector 200 is inserted into the fixed connector 300, resulting in initial rotational and axial alignment of the connectors 200 and 300. Although the subsea connector system 100 is designed for anyorientation, the following discussion relates to a vertical ROV installation for ease of understanding and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention.<br /><br />FIG. 13 shows a typical vertical alignment operation where the initial alignment of the removable connector 200 into the fixed connector 300 is very skewed. Each external transverse edge of the top of the housing 210 has a radius 264 to preventthat edge from gouging or otherwise seizing in the interior of connector body 310 during stabbing. These rounded corners and the sloping sides of the frustrated pyramidal reducing tube 314 in the fixed housing 310 facilitate the self-correcting behaviorof the alignment process. The rounded corners of the removable housing 210 tend to slide down the interior surface of the fixed housing 310, thereby increasing the alignment forces and assisting in the alignment process.<br /><br />The latch pin 330 is specially designed to be instrumental in the latching process but also assists in the fine alignment process that mates the male and female couplers 401 and 430. The latch sleeve 250 has internal slots 254 for receiving thelatch dogs 331 of the latch pin 330. As the ROV pushes the removable connector 200 further into the fixed connector 300, the dogs 331 slip through the slots 254 and the shank of the latch pin through the clearance hole 258 of the latch sleeve 250 andare guided upward in preparation for the final alignment of the comateable male and female couplers 430 and 401.<br /><br />During the latching operation, the latching system 150 must forcibly pull the removable connector 200 and the fixed connector 300 together to overcome a separation force generated by any internal pressure within the female couplings 401 and/ormale couplings 430. After the coarse alignment of the removable connector 200 into the fixed connector 300 (as described above), the latching process is performed. First, the removable connector 200 is pushed into the fixed connector 300 by the ROVuntil the latch pin 330 has fully entered the latch sleeve 250 of the removable connector 200. FIGS. 3 and 9 show the positions of the components of the latching system 150 at the initially stabbed position for the latching system. An industry-standardwrenching device, such as a torque tool, engages the industry-standard square profile 221 on the exposed end of the drive screw 220.<br /><br />As the torque tool rotates the drive screw 220, the latch sleeve 250 is drawn towards the latch assembly end plate 270 and is forced to rotate forty-five degrees by the reaction of the camming pin 228 in the helical rotation groove 241. Theresultant forty-five degree rotation during this reciprocation of the latch sleeve 250 aligns the latch dogs 331 with the latching shoulders 253. Further reciprocation due to additional engagement of drive screw 220 into the threads 252 of the latchsleeve 250, along with attendant alignment of the camming pin into the axial travel groove 242, causes the upper partial frustroconical faces of the latch dogs 331 of the latch pin 330 to begin to abut on the partial frustroconical latching shoulders 253of the latch sleeve 250. The positions of the components of the latching system 150 in this situation are shown in FIGS. 4 and 10. At this point the entrapment of the removable connector 200 by the fixed connector can be increased by means of screwingdrive screw 220 farther into latch sleeve 250. Fine rotational and angular alignment is provided as the small removable tube 213 with parallel sides engages the parallel sides of the small fixed tube 315.<br /><br />As described above, internal threads 252 of the latch sleeve 250 are permanently engaged with external threads 225 on the drive screw 220. Therefore, the final rotation of the drive screw 220 results in the removable connector 300 moving intothe fixed connector 200, thereby compelling the female connector poppet 403 and the male connector poppet 432 to overcome their respective bias springs 418 and 438 so that the couplings 400 are in their open flowing condition shown in FIG. 7.<br /><br />FIG. 2 shows the subsea connector system 100 after the latch pin 330 is fully latched within the latch sleeve 250 and the hydraulic couplings 400 fully connected. FIGS. 5 and 11 correspond to the condition of the latching system 150 in thisfully latched position.<br /><br />In the event of thread galling or seizing, the latching system 150 can be over-ridden by using the drive screw 220 to apply excessive torque. This causes the shearable camming sleeve mounting screws 244 mounted in holes 242 and 251 to rupture atthe interface of camming sleeve 240 and latch sleeve 250, thereby releasing the camming sleeve 240 from the latch sleeve 250. The latch sleeve 250 can then be rotated forty-five degrees due to the assumed bound or galled condition between the drivescrew 220 and the latch sleeve 250. After rotating forty-five degrees, the removable connector 200 must be forced away from the fixed connector 300 to overcome any vacuum created within the couplings 401 and 430 after their poppets seat.<br /><br />Although the invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that modifications and improvements can be made to the inventive concepts herein without departing fromthe scope of the invention. For instance, various sizes and types of couplings 400 can be used at the same time, and electrical and fiber optic connections also coupled. Furthermore, the transverse cross-sections of the removable and fixed housings canhave polygonal shapes other than the squares shown herein. Hydraulic couplings, which are flush-faced, can also be utilized. The embodiments shown herein are merely illustrative of the inventive concepts and should not be interpreted as limiting thescope of the invention.<br /><br />ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br /><br />The present invention provides several advantages over prior products. The couplings and the latch mechanism are very well protected by virtue of being fully encloseable for the fixed connector and largely enclosed for the removable connector. A very significant advantage is that the operating threads of the latching mechanism are always fully engaged, thereby protecting them from inadvertent damage and avoiding the very problematic stabbing of threaded connections by robotic installationmeans. The geometry of the present invention is readily changed so that a variety of types and numbers of couplings can be utilized with the same latching mechanism. The self-aligning characteristics of the interacting fixed and removable housingsparticularly ease robotic assembly of the connectors. The ability to release the connectors by applying overtorque to shear the connection between the camming sleeve and the latch sleeve in the event of malfunction of the conventional release means isparticularly necessary for subsea connections. These and other advantages combine to make this novel connector particularly desirable for subsea and other robotic use.<br /><br />* * * * * </p><h4>Other References</h4><ul><li style="margin-left: 15px">Duco, Inc., Drawing and Specifications for Construction of Surface Termination, May 25, 1999.</li></ul><div id="fields_of_search" style="padding-top:10px;"><div class="adslike_fos"><p><h2>Field of Search</h2><a class="htt" id="f439352000" href="/class/439/352/With_additional_means_to_cause_or_prevent_unlatching/1.html">With additional means to cause or prevent unlatching</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439362000" href="/class/439/362/Parallel_to_connection/1.html">Parallel to connection</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439953000" href="/class/439/953/WITH_LATCH_ROD_TO_BE_RETAININGLY_RECEIVED_BY_OPENING_OF_MATING_CONNECTOR/1.html">WITH LATCH ROD TO BE RETAININGLY RECEIVED BY OPENING OF MATING CONNECTOR</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439559000" href="/class/439/559/With_sealing_to_panel/1.html">With sealing to panel</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439587000" href="/class/439/587/Sealing/1.html">Sealing</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439577000" href="/class/439/577/COMBINED_WITH_NONELECTRICAL_FEATURE/1.html">COMBINED WITH NONELECTRICAL FEATURE</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439595000" href="/class/439/595/Hinged_or_flexed_detent_on_insulation_engaging_to_secure_contact_within_coupling_part_housing/1.html">Hinged or flexed detent on insulation engaging to secure contact within coupling part housing</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439274000" href="/class/439/274/Combined_with_distinct_cable_sheath_sealing_element_or_material/1.html">Combined with distinct cable sheath sealing element or material</a><br /><br /><a class="htt" id="f439680000" href="/class/439/680/By_key_or_guideway/1.html">By key or guideway</a></p></div><div style="float:left; width:49.9%; padding-left:10px;"><div class="konafilter">
