applying for a rezoning of their property will submit a proposal which, either
explicitly or implicitly, promises to develop the property in a specific
way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>City council members and
neighboring landowners often feel betrayed when such promises are not
kept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>As a result, lawmakers have
developed several methods of zoning which attempt to hold landowners to their

premise underlying the decisions of most state courts approving conditional
zoning ï¿½ that the rezoning would have been appropriate even without the
conditions ï¿½ is not a prerequisite for conditional use zoning as approved in
North Carolina, the supreme court cannot accurately state that it is joining a
growing number of jurisdictions that approve of conditional use zoning. In
fact, North Carolina has instituted a novel zoning approach.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in'>{35}<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ </span>The City of Charlotte has attempted to implement
a purely legislative system of conditional use zoning.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Such a system violates N.C.G.S. ï¿½ 160A-381,
382, and thus is invalid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Although
conditional use zoning has been approved in North Carolina, both the courts and
the legislature have limited such approval to systems which utilize a two step
process ï¿½ a legislative rezoning decision followed by a quasi-judicial
determination of whether to issue a conditional use permit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>No decision of an appellate court in this
state has approved a one-step, wholly legislative, conditional use zoning
procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>By statute, a property owner
who has been granted a rezoning of his property to a conditional use district
is required to apply for a conditional use permit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">ï¿½ </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>See </i>N.C.G.S. ï¿½
160A-381, 382.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Thus, the conditional
use permit may not be written out of a system of conditional use district
zoning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>The City of Charlotteï¿½s
position that the conditional use permit in this case was superfluous and that
its purely legislative process was proper is erroneous.</p>
