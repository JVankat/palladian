Alexander Lukashenko added that Belarus has never had any moot points with the Russian army.<br /><br />Anatoly Serdyukov praised the level of the Belarusian-Russian cooperation in the military area and underlined that “all the serious issues are addressed in time”.<br /><br />On April 30, the joint board of the Defence Ministries of Belarus and Russia plan to sign an intergovernmental agreement on joint technical supply of the regional force grouping of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation and a bilateral agreement on interaction in radioelectronic struggle. <br /><br /><b>Alexander Lukashenko: Russian elections created solid foundation for continuity in Belarusian-Russian relations</b><br /><br />President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko believes it is important that results of the Russian elections had created a solid foundation for ensuring continuity in the development of Belarusian-Russian relations. The President made the statement as part of his Address to the Belarusian nation and the National Assembly on April 29.<br /><br />In his words, the Union of Belarus and Russia has been created and operates with a view to reinforcing the two countries and promoting a real multipolar world. “I can tell those who predicted a rapid demise for the Union that while Russia and Belarus gain more and more power, our union grows stronger,” said the President of Belarus.<br /><br />Alexander Lukashenko also noted, “The geography of international visits over the last few years explicitly indicates major components of our multivector policy: Russia, the CIS states, the Persian Gulf, China, Venezuela, India, and South Africa”. In his words, the country has to diversify its foreign relations, to ensure Belarus’ real economic presence in these countries. “On the other hand, cooperating with these countries we can safeguard Belarus’ economy from threatening changes on global commodity and financial markets. Belarus will continue consistently and pragmatically building up its position in major strategic avenues,” stressed the President of Belarus. <br /><br /><b><li><font color="#CC0A0A">Other Belarusian News...</font></B><br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Sanctions against Belarusian companies undermine trust in US as partner, Sergei Aleinik says</font></H2><br />From: BelTA<br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img width="285" height="272" src="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/image_full/international/photosvideos/photos/george-bush-leads-the-us-towar.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>The actions of the USA against some Belarusian companies do not only undermine trust in the United Sates as a partner but also show a selective attitude of the USA to its international-legal obligations, Permanent Representative of Belarus to the UN Office and other international organisations in Geneva Sergei Aleinik said when taking part in the general discussion of the second session of the Preparatory Committee in the run-up to the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The forum is held in Geneva on April 28-May 9, BelTA was told in the Belarus permanent mission. <br /><br />The diplomat stressed that in the context of NPT, security safeguards are of crucial importance. “For the NPT non-nuclear members the legally binding safeguards are the key to trust and predictability in the relations between states, to the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. Providing security safeguards is an important step in this direction, though not the only one. What is more important and, as it has turned out, more difficult is to observe the given guarantees,” Sergei Aleinik said.<br /><br />According to him, Belarus voluntarily gave up an opportunity to have nuclear weapons and joined NPT as a non-nuclear state in 1993.<br /><br />“Russia, the USA and Great Britain hailed that decision and in 1994 signed a memorandum of security safeguards in connection with Belarus’ accession to NPT. In line with this document, in exchange for the voluntary withdrawal of nuclear weapons, the aforementioned states pledged to respect the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Belarus and not to apply measures of economic pressure. Some ten years later the USA forgot about those safeguards in respect of several Belarusian petrochemical companies. This unfriendly move does not only undermine the trust in the United States as a partner but shows the selective attitude of the USA to its international-legal obligations,” Sergei Aleinik said. <br /><br />According to him, “there comes a logical question: What are the security safeguards of the biggest possessor of nuclear weapons worth of?”<br /><br />“In this connection we stress the importance of signing an international legally binding document on security safeguards,” Sergei Aleinik said. <br /><br /><b>US diplomats who have been declared persona non grata to depart Belarus at a set date</b><br /><br />The US diplomats who have been declared persona non grata will leave the Republic of Belarus within the agreed upon period.<br /><br />As BelTA was told in the Foreign Ministry of Belarus, a working meeting with Charge d’Affaires a.i. of the United States of America in the Republic of Belarus Jonathan Moore took place in the Foreign Ministry on May 1.<br /><br />At a meeting a day before, the US diplomat was informed that as of April 30 the staff of the Belarusian Embassy in Washington was decreased down to 6 people, including the Ambassador. The USA had been informed about the step in advance. In view of the USA’s refusal to follow the Foreign Ministry’s proposal to decrease the staff of the US Embassy in Minsk in a similar manner, Jonathan Moore was given a note of the Foreign Ministry and a list of US diplomats, who are now persona non grata and must leave the Republic of Belarus. <br /><br /><b>Belarus’ Foreign Ministry gives persona non grata list to Jonathan Moore</b><br /><br />Charge d’Affaires a.i. of the United States of America in the Republic of Belarus Jonathan Moore was invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus on April 30.<br /><br />During the meeting the US diplomat was informed that as of April 30 the staff of the Belarusian Embassy in Washington was decreased down to 6 people, including the Ambassador.

However, the statement made by Jeffrey Gedmin, head of the Liberty/Free Europe radio station, is nothing but an emotional and unfounded accusation. Mr Gedmin might have thought, in particular, about liability for slander in mass media before making rash comments”. <br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Ликвидирован крупный пожар на нефтебазе в Бресте</font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://news.tut.by/society/108354.html" target="_blank">Tut.by</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://img.tut.by/n/pojar04-3.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Около 180 тонн бензина сгорело во время пожара на нефтебазе, находящейся в черте Бреста, сообщили "Интерфаксу" в воскресенье в брестском областном управлении по чрезвычайным ситуациям. <br /><br />"Пожар на одной из брестских нефтебаз, в результате которого сгорело 180 тонн бензина, ликвидирован", - сообщили в управлении. <br /><br />По словам собеседника агентства, пожар тушили около 90 единиц техники. Эвакуация населения не проводилась, пострадавших в результате пожара нет. <br /><br />Как сообщалось, в субботу загорелась нефтебаза "Брестоблнефтепродукт", находящаяся в черте Бреста. Пожару была присвоена третья категория сложности. <br /><br />По данным областного управления министерства по чрезвычайным ситуациям Беларуси, "причиной пожара могло стать попадание грозового разряда в резервуар". <br /><br />Всего на нефтебазе расположено шесть резервуаров с бензином, в которых могло находиться около 400 тонн топлива. <br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Belarus thinks it inadmissible to use nuclear weapons in international disputes</font></H2><br />From: BelTA<br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://supak.com/store/videos/images/dr-strangelove.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>As the country which was worst affected by the Chernobyl disaster, Belarus believes it is inadmissible to use and threat to use nuclear weapons in addressing any international dispute, Permanent Representative of Belarus in the UN Office and other international organisations in Geneva Sergei Aleinik said when taking part in the general discussion of the second session of the Preparatory Committee in the run-up to the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The forum is held in Geneva on April 28-May 9, BelTA was told in the Belarus permanent mission. <br /><br />Sergei Aleinik said that for forty years NPT has been the fundamental element of the international security system. Belarus attaches equal importance to all key elements of the Treaty – disarmament, non-proliferation and the right for peaceful nuclear energy.<br /><br />“Belarus was the first state which voluntarily refused from a possibility to possess nuclear weapons which were left on its territory after the Soviet Union collapse. Confirming its commitment to the NPT obligations, Belarus urges to work towards the NPT strategic goal which is nuclear disarmament. In this respect the statements of several nuclear countries on the measures to reduce strategic nuclear weapons are of a positive importance. At the same time Belarus thinks these steps are not enough especially considering the further upgrading of nuclear weapons, development of new weapons and the existence of the defence doctrines which admit the use of nuclear weapons. Belarus believes that the steps of the international community in nuclear disarmament should be supplemented with tangible efforts of the nuclear states both within the framework of the existing and future treaty obligations and also unilaterally,” Sergei Aleinik said.<br /><br />According to him, the Belarusian side welcomes the progress on the way of the entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as the number of the states which have ratified it has been growing. Belarus also urged the countries, on which the entry into force of the treaty depend, to ratify it as soon as possible. “We believe that the existing moratorium on nuclear tests cannot replace the CTBT legal obligations,” Sergei Aleinik said. <br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">No plans for double citizenship in Belarus</font></H2><br />From: BelTA<br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://www.belarusguide.com/images/statehood/passport.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>The concept of the bill on compatriots abroad that will be brought in the House of Representatives of the National Assembly in July 2008 does not provide for introducing double citizenship for ethnic Belarusians abroad, Commissioner for Religions and Nationalities under the Council of Ministers of Belarus Leonid Gulyako said as he met with representatives of the Belarusian diaspora in Minsk on April 30.<br /><br />“Taking into account the forthcoming parliamentary elections the bill is likely to be given the second reading by the new convocation House of Representatives,” remarked Leonid Gulyako.<br /><br />The bill on compatriots abroad was developed by the Foreign Ministry of Belarus with participation of the Office of the Commissioner for Religions and Nationalities. Leonid Gulyako admitted the bill may be amended to take into account Poland’s introduction of the Pole cards. “The bill is unlikely to directly refer to the ‘Pole cards’ however some additional principles in view of the situation will be stipulated,” he remarked. <br /><br /><b>Belarus elected to two UN commissions</b><br /><br />At the organizational session of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in New York Belarus was unanimously elected for a 4-year term to two ECOSOC functional commissions: the Commission on Population and Development and the Commission on the Status of Women, BelTA learnt from Belarus permanent representative office in the UN. <br /><br />The Commission on Population and Development is composed of 47 states. The Commission constitutes an intergovernmental mechanism that plays the primary role in the follow-up to the implementation of the 1994 Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development. Its main objectives are monitoring, reviewing and assessing the implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, providing appropriate recommendations to the Council. The only time Belarus participated in the work of this commission was in 2000-2003.<br /><br />It is symbolic that the election of Belarus to the commission coincided with a relevant statement of President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko. In the State of the Nation Address to the Belarusian people and the National Assembly the head of state underlined that the population of Belarus should increase at least three times and the state considers it vitally important for the future of the nation.<br /><br />Commission on the Status of Women is a central intergovernmental body responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the international UN conferences on women’s rights. The membership of the commission includes 45 states. The commission was created as a mechanism to promote, report on and monitor issues relating to the political, economic, civil, social and educational rights of women. The commission also prepares the recommendations for ECOSOC on most urgent problems in the area of women’s rights that require immediate resolution. Last time Belarus was elected member of the commission was 15 years ago. <br /><br /><b><li><font color="#CC0A0A">Economics...</font></B><br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Belarusian oil Company opens subsidiary company in London</font></H2><br />From: BelTA<br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img width="285" height="207" src="http://n-europe.eu/content/uploads/2007/11/Belneftekhim.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Belarusian Oil Company (BOC) opened a subsidiary company in London - BNK (UK) Ltd., BOC deputy director general of Alexander Demidov told BelTA.<br /><br />According to him, the company was registered in April 2008. It will sell oil products to end consumers in North-Western Europe. The goal is to start using the mechanism of insuring price risks and attracting financial resources. BNK (UK) Ltd. will be working under direct contracts with end users, for example, the companies which have networks of filling stations in that region.<br /><br />The company is expected to start working in H2 this year and will promote sales of Belarusian oil products in North-Western Europe. <br /><br />Alexander Demidov did not rule out that Belarusian Oil Company will be opening its subsidiaries in other curtness including in the neighboring states, for example, Poland and Ukraine. “This is our first subsidiary company. We will be working on opening new ones on other markets,” Alexander Demidov said.<br /><br />Belarusian Oil Company consolidates the exports of Belarusian oil products to increase their efficiency. In Q1 BOC handled around 80% of exports of Belarusian oil products. In H2 the share will be increased to 100%. The exports average 400,000 tonnes a month.<br /><br />In 2008, BOC is expected to export around 6.6 million tonnes of oil products to the tune of $3.7 billion. <br /><br />Belarusian Oil Company was registered in the Republic of Belarus on May 17, 2007. The shareholders are Belorusneft, OAO Naftan, Mozyr Oil Refinery, and Belarusian Oil Trading House. Belarusian Oil Company was founded following the President’s instruction to optimise oil purchases and the export of petroleum products. Belarusian Oil Company is expected to specialise in bulk purchases of oil, oil processing at Belarusian oil refineries and exporting petroleum products. Belarusian Oil Company held the first trading session in petroleum products using Belneftekhim’s e-trade system on June 29. <br /><b><li>Note: BNK - Bel Neft Kem</b><br /><br /><b>Belarus can become one of thirty countries with best investment climate, Piotr Prokopovich says</b><br /><br />In the upcoming years Belarus can become one of thirty countries with best investment climate, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Bank of Belarus Piotr Prokopovich told BelTA.<br /><br />“The plans are feasible,” Piotr Prokopovich said. “By attracting investments we strengthen our economy. Therefore foreign investments are helpful in enhancing economic security, sovereignty of Belarus on the whole,” he said.<br /><br />“The main thing is that the sovereign Belarus has become a reality. This is what President of the country Alexander Lukashenko spoke about in his State of the Nation Address to the Belarusian people and the National Assembly. As a sovereign state we need to ensure our future independence including economic independence,” Piotr Prokopovich added. <br /><br /><b>Ukraine to join Grodno hydroelectric power station construction</b><br /><br />Ukrainian specialists will partake in the development of the construction project of the Grodno hydroelectric power station, BelTA learnt from the Grodnoenergo Company.<br /><br />The general designer of the hydroelectric power station is a research company BelNIPIenergoprom. The most difficult stage is to design the building of the hydroelectric power station and an overflow dam. The specialists of the Ukrainian company Hydroproject were engaged to assist in designing these elements.<br /><br />At present the specialists of the company Grodnopromstroi are preparing a foundation pit that is to be ready by the end of the year.<br /><br />In May, Belarus plans to sign a contract with the Iranian company Marvestan Group on the delivery of equipment for the hydroelectric power station.<br /><br />The Grodno hydroelectric power station will be built in the high-water bed of the river Neman in line with the state comprehensive programme on modernization of the major production funds of the Belarusian energy system. The capacity of the new hydroelectric power station will total 17MW. The Grodno hydroelectric power station slated for the completion in 2010 will develop cheap eco-friendly energy and enhance the stable electric supply of the oblast center. <br /><br /><b><li><font color="#CC0A0A">From the International Press...</font></B><br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">US orders Belarus embassy closed in widening diplomatic rift<br /></font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://my.earthlink.net/article/top?guid=20080501/48194040_3ca6_15526200805012081018909" target="_blank">earthlink.net</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://stockholm.usembassy.gov/images/dos_seal.gif"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>The State Department on Thursday ordered Belarus to close its embassy in Washington and its consulate in New York and said it will shut down the U.S. Embassy in the Belarusian capital.<br /><br />In a new escalation of a diplomatic dispute, Belarus has been given until May 16 to withdraw its six diplomats at the two missions and the American embassy in Minsk will cease operations as early as Friday, officials told the Associated Press. The move is just a step short of severing diplomatic relations and is the latest in a series of tit-for-tat exchanges with the former Soviet republic.<br /><br />The officials said Belarus was notified of the decision in simultaneous meetings between U.S. and Belarusian diplomats in Washington and Minsk at 10 a.m. EDT. They spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement expected later Thursday.<br /><br />Closing a U.S. embassy abroad is extremely rare and usually occurs only in conflict zones or in anticipation of instability, the officials said. It was not immediately clear when the United States had last shut down an embassy for purely political reasons.<br /><br />The United States is one of the fiercest critics of Belarus' authoritarian president, and relations have deteriorated notably this year amid pressure from Washington for Belarus to release political prisoners or face punitive sanctions. Belarus on Wednesday ordered most of the U.S. Embassy staff in Minsk to leave the country in 72 hours.<br /><br />The U.S. ambassador left Minsk in March after Belarus pulled its ambassador from Washington. The U.S. embassy in Minsk, which had 35 diplomats at the beginning of the year, was being forced to cut its staff to four. The officials said the mission would not be able to function with such a small number of personnel.<br /><br />The State Department had protested the expulsions as "unjustified and unwarranted" and on Wednesday said it was considering a wide array of options to respond.<br /><br />"We want to have a good relationship with Belarus and work to try to improve that," spokesman Sean McCormack said then. "But we are not going to do that and sacrifice the principles of pushing for freedom of expression, political freedoms and other freedoms in Belarus."<br /><br />The officials said arrangements were being made with a third country to assume "protecting power" responsibilities for the U.S. interests in Belarus, most notably looking after the care of an ailing American lawyer who is currently in Belarusian custody.<br /><br />The United States has demanded that the lawyer, 54-year-old Emanuel Zeltser, who suffers from diabetes, be released from a psychiatric ward where he is being held. Zeltser was detained on March 12 on suspicion of using false documents and his family says Belarusian authorities are denying him medication. He faces three years in prison if convicted.<br /><br />Relations between Minsk and Washington have spiraled downward in recent months, mainly because of U.S. sanctions imposed on a state-controlled oil-processing and chemicals company, Belneftekhim, as well as travel restrictions on President Alexander Lukashenko and top government officials.<br /><br />The sanctions are designed to punish Lukashenko, who U.S. officials routinely describe as "Europe's last dictator," and his government for its heavy-handed treatment of critics and intolerance of dissent.<br /><br />The United States has repeatedly raised the case of imprisoned dissidents, including opposition leader Alexander Kozulin who was arrested during a protest after challenging Lukashenko in the 2006 presidential election, which the U.S. dismissed as illegitimate. He was convicted of organizing mass protests and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in a high-security prison.<br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">US backs down on Belarus embassy closure</font></H2><br />From: <a href="" target="_blank">AP</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img width="220" height="254" src="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/negroponte.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b>John Negroponte</b></td></tr></table>The United States abruptly backed down on a decision to order the closure of the Belarusian embassy in Washington and consulate in New York just minutes before American diplomats were to inform Belarus of the move on Thursday, U.S. officials said.<br /><br />The State Department had planned to notify Belarus of the step, which had been approved by Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, in both Washington and Minsk. But officials said they were instructed not to do so at the last minute. The change in plan came as a meeting between U.S. and Belarusian diplomats was under way, the officials said.<br /><br />Instead, State Department spokesman Tom Casey said the diplomats had warned that such steps were possible as Washington continues to explore ways to retaliate for Belarus' expulsion of most of the U.S. Embassy staff in Minsk.<br /><br />"We told them we would comply with the expulsion order and we warned them that there is a range of actions that we can take," Casey said. "We have to consider whether, after drawing down our staff, we can effectively operate there."<br /><br />He would not elaborate on what measures might be taken.<br /><br />But orders had been prepared to tell Belarus it had until May 16 to withdraw its six diplomats at its missions in Washington and New York, officials said. At the same time, Belarus was to have been told that the U.S. embassy in Minsk would shut down as early as Friday, they said.<br /><br />Planning for the closure of the Minsk Embassy has been under way for some time and had reached the stage of securing a third country to serve as a "protecting power" to represent U.S. in Belarus, the officials said. <br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">US diplomats leave Belarus amid escalating diplomatic spat</font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jv76g29y-bo8onkFlL6a5iomhZ_QD90E6P7O0" target="_blank">AP</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://ap.google.com/media/ALeqM5iMBpaLR24mK45mxtgVjXI4tJcA1Q?size=s"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Eleven U.S. diplomats left Belarus on Saturday after being declared persona non grata amid escalating diplomatic tensions between Washington and the ex-Soviet nation, an embassy official said.<br /><br />Belarus on Wednesday had ordered 10 of the embassy's 11 diplomats to leave the country, giving them 72 hours to comply.<br /><br />All 11 left Saturday, a U.S. Embassy official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.<br /><br />The departures leave the embassy with just four U.S. staffers, down from 35 at the start of the year.

The authorities learned about it after presentation of the documentary at school. A thorough check-up was organized, as a result of which the chair of the education department of Hrodna city executive committee Siarhei Blazhei, the school director Ihar Akhmetau and Aliaksandr Rabkou could lose their job.<br /><br />The report which the pupils presented for the conference was dedicated to the history of the Lutheran protestant community in Hrodna. Their teacher also prepared a substantial report called ‘Patriotic upbringing of children on the example of the museum of the 23rd army.’ However, the authorities still remember the film. That’s why they decided to take revenge on its authors. <br /><br />At the same time, the documentary is actively distributed in Hrodna.

Moreover, leaflets of the unregistered National Bolshevik Party were found out on the scene.<br /><br />It was found out that Militia Academy cadet Kruhlik, who was walking around night Minsk with his wife, saw three men near the BPF office “drawing inscriptions on the door.“ Moreover, the cadet heard sound of alarm.

"Perhaps you know the situation better than us?" one of them asked a reporter.<br /><br />POLITICAL CRISIS<br /><br />The question of who is in charge matters because Russia has no track record of power-sharing. Observers say there is great potential for confusion and incoherence that could make the vast, nuclear-armed country ungovernable.<br /><br />"You cannot rule out that their (Putin and Medvedev's) views will differ fundamentally on some important question. That will lead to political crisis," analyst Grigory Dobromelov wrote in a comment for the Centre for Political Technologies, a think tank. <br /><br />What is not in question is that Putin will have more power than indicated by the job description for prime minister -- a junior role to the president which for the past eight years has been filled by low-profile technocrats.<br /><br />He controls the legislature through United Russia, the party he has agreed to chair and which has a majority in parliament. That allows him to block some Kremlin decisions, change the constitution or launch impeachment proceedings against the president.<br /><br />In a symbolic move, United Russia has transferred its headquarters to a building near the Kremlin, where its neighbour is the presidential administration.<br /><br />Putin has a sky-high popularity rating, and a network of allies in government who are likely to retain key posts after the handover. Medvedev, by contrast, has spent his political career in Putin's shadow.<br /><br />"Medvedev does not have his own team, his own people. He doesn't have his own bureaucrats or businessmen on which he can rely," said a source with links to the Kremlin.<br /><br />"He can rely only on Putin, therefore he has no choice but to do as he is told."<br /><br />CENTRE OF POWER<br /><br />Putin has also been quietly beefing up prime ministerial powers. One example: he issued a decree on April 28 ordering regional governors to submit annual reports on their performance to the government. Previously, they were filed to the Kremlin.<br /><br />"(There is a) process of 'soft' redistribution of power between the president and the prime minister," Russia's Centre for Current Politics wrote in a research note.<br /><br />"For the first time in the history of post-Soviet Russia, the prime minister's job is being transformed from a technical one to a real decision-making centre."<br /><br />Putin is stepping down as president in line with a constitutional ban on leaders serving more than two consecutive terms. Some supporters had pressed him to seek a third term, but he has always ruled out changing the constitution to do this.<br /><br />Observers say that staying on could have damaged Russia's international standing and dented the reputation Putin cultivated at home as a leader who respects the law.<br /><br />Russian officials hang the portrait of the serving president on their office walls in a mark of respect. Putin, asked by a reporter if Medvedev would adorn his prime ministerial office, said he did not feel the need.<br /><br />Less clear than Putin's power is whether he will exercise it, and if he does, for how long.<br /><br />"It comes down to how that is used," said a diplomatic source. "It is difficult to make a judgement because hard information is so scarce."<br /><br />One theory is that once Medvedev has settled in to the presidency Putin plans to step back and let his protege put his own mark on the job, perhaps by implementing liberal reforms and adopting a less abrasive approach with the West.<br /><br />Others say that is wishful thinking. "Nothing will change," said the source with Kremlin links. "Putin will remain the only effective force in the upper reaches of power."<br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Russia Will Raise Oil Export Tax by 17% to Record </font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aGyKd4AXfF6c&refer=home" target="_blank">Bloomburg</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060919/biz2.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Russia will increase its crude export tax by 17 percent to a record on June 1, after oil prices rose in March and April. <br /><br />The tax will be set at $398.10 a metric ton, the seventh consecutive increase, Alexander Sakovich, deputy head of the Finance Ministry's customs department, said by telephone in Moscow today. The current duty is $340.10 a ton, or $46.40 a barrel. <br /><br />Russia revises its export taxes on crude and oil products every two months based on the previous two-month average price for Urals, the country's benchmark export blend. That stood at a record $102.76 a barrel in the period, Sakovich said. Oil prices have risen 68 percent since the same time last year. <br /><br />``The government is addicted to high oil revenues,'' said Michael Teagarden, a sales trader at UBS AG in Moscow. ``Russia needs to wean itself from this windfall and encourage producers to spend the money developing new fields.'' <br /><br />Russia's oil production, which fell to an 18-month low of 9.72 million barrels a day in April, may decline this year for the first time in a decade as producers struggle with high costs, aging fields and new deposits in increasingly remote areas. The government is considering tax breaks to stimulate investment. <br /><br />Export taxes on refined oil will rise 16 percent to $280.50 a ton for light products, such as gasoline and butane, Sakovich said.

A few may be available in specialist shops; but dolls of Adolf Hitler have also gone on sale in specialist shops both in the U.S. and the UK. The same doll is, in fact, available in Britain. There is nothing unique or remarkable about the fact that these dolls are available to a niche market in Ukraine. <br /><br />We also stated that “Germany’s occupation of Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union, left 2 to 3 million people dead, including 1.5 million Jews,” as reported in the Telegraph. This statement is misleading. It is hard to calculate exactly how many Ukrainians died in World War ii as Ukraine was then part of the Soviet Union. Reliable estimates put Ukraine’s wartime deaths as high as 10 million. <br /><br />The article has been removed from our website and we apologize for any offense we may have caused any of our readers. Thanks to those who wrote in to inform us of our error. The Trumpet remains committed to providing accurate reporting and analysis. <br /><br /><b><li><font color="#CC0A0A">From the Polish Scandal Files...</font></B><br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Self defence clause to be put into penal code</font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://www.polskieradio.pl/thenews/politics/?id=81002" target="_blank">The News</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img width="220" height="335" src="http://www.stallone.pl/images/news/lepper.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Following the Supreme Court’s ruling that Piotr J. is innocent of murder after shooting someone breaking into his house, the government wants a change in the penal code to protect those acting in self defence.  <br /><br />Victims of assaults who killed their attackers in self-defense will probably be able to avoid going on trial.<br /><br />At present, it can take years before their innocence is proved by court. <br /><br />Yesterday the Supreme court declared Piotr J., who in September 2005 shot a man trying to break into his house, not guilty. His trial lasted three years in total. <br /><br />This is why the Ministry of Justice announced plans to amend the Polish penal code in order to protect people acting in self-defence, making it possible for prosecutors to discontinue proceedings against a person at the investigation stage, without taking them to court. This way the procedure would last a couple of months, instead of a couple of years. <br /><br />Penal law experts vary in their opinion concerning the amendment. While some praise it for protecting those who take necessary action when their lives are in danger, others point out that in such grave matters prosecutors will be reluctant to rely on their own moral judgement, and would rather write an indictment and forward the case to a court anyway than discontinue proceedings. <br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Another referee detained in Polish football scam</font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://www.polskieradio.pl/thenews/news/?id=81207" target="_blank">The News</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://www.burnley.gov.uk/youthscene/pics/cards/red_card.gif"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Another referee has been detained today in connection with the ongoing investigation into widespread corruption within Polish football.<br /><br />"We have detained a referee who is suspected of corruption in sports, but our suspicions don't concern any premier league match," Edward Zalewski of the Wroclaw prosecutor's office told the Polish Press Agency. He added that the referee is likely to hear charges today.<br /><br />The investigation on the corruption scandal in Polish football has been underway since May 2005. So far some 100 people have been charged, including sport activists, referees and Polish Football Association officials.<br /><br />Last December the first corruption trail started in a court in Wroclaw, western Poland.

Belarus had no NHL players on its roster Saturday.<br /><br />Ruslan Salei of the Colorado Avalanche should help the Belarus defense starting Monday against Switzerland according to coach Curt Fraser.<br /><br />"Unfortunately for us, when you score five goals, you'd better win the game," Fraser said. "I thought our team as a whole played a very good game."<br /><br />Sweden outshot Belarus 46-24.<br /><br />In the other Group A game, Switzerland defeated France 4-1.

It was his first goal of the tournament and the game-winner. Koivu added a third-period goal and Hannes Hyvonen and Teemu Selanne also scored for Finland.

The youngster has been a revelation on the WTA tour since her breakthrough in 2007'</b></td></tr></table>Olga Govortsova and Victoria Azarenka are among the Belarussian women making waves on the circuit as the former Soviet country seeks to establish itself as a centre of tennis excellence.<br /><br />'Victoria Azarenka is a class act. The youngster has been a revelation on the WTA tour since her breakthrough in 2007'Belarus is less known for its tennis than neighbouring Russia. However, over the past year the country has managed to deliver an increasing number of players onto the WTA tour.<br /><br />Belarus can now boast two top 50 players in the world and both of these talents have enough skill to go even higher, and sooner rather than later. Belarus has been firmly put on the tennis map and major success is not far away.<br /><br />Victoria Azarenka is a class act. Currently destroying her opponents in the Prague Open the youngster has been a revelation on the WTA tour since her breakthrough in 2007. <br /><br />She is still only 18 but has already had a fair amount of success and seems to be getting stronger and more experienced with every match she plays.<br /><br />She is learning from her mistakes, building up her confidence and is being rewarded for her efforts. Already world number 26 Azarenka has what it takes to be at least a top 10 player and has the power game to mix it with the best of the WTA tour.<br /><br />Although 2008 has been less successful than 2007 so far, she is coming back to form with the start of the clay court season, a surface she obviously loves as she reached the final in Estoril last year and the semis in Prague.<br /><br />She can play on any surface and at the later end of 2007 she reached the quarter finals in Los Angeles, Moscow and Luxembourg and had brilliant wins over Maria Sharapova, Nadia Petrova and Agnieska Radwanska.<br /><br />She is a top player and I think a good run at this year's French Open will make her the first player from Belarus since Natasha Zvereva to break into the WTA top 20.<br /><br />Olga Govortsova is equally as talented as Victoria. At only 20 the young player made huge strides up the rankings last year while playing on mainly the challenger circuit at low-key events. However on the US hardcourt season at the end of 2007 she stepped up to the main WTA tour with considerable success reaching the quarter finals in Cincinnati, Quebec and Stanford and also reached semi-finals in Tashkent.<br /><br />I think Govortsova just needs a little more consistency in her game to make the next step up from top 50 player to potential top 20 player, she certainly has the talent!  She is one of the most hard working players on the tour and won an incredible 68 matches in 2007.<br /><br />in 2008 Govortsova has already reached her first WTA tour final, losing in Memphis by Lindsay Davenport.<br /><br />Both Azarenka and Govortsova are young enough to keep Belarussia on the tennis map for many years to come.<br /><br />Even younger is Anna Orlik who is a great prospect at only 15 and success could be soon around the corner for the brilliant junior.<br /><br />Watch out Russia, Belarus is catching you fast!<br /><br /><b><li><font color="#CC0A0A">Cultural scene...</font></B><br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Twenty-one-year-old resident of Vitsyebsk becomes Miss Belarus 2008</font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://naviny.by/rubrics/inter/2008/05/03/ic_news_259_290144/" target="_blank">Naveny</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img width="285" height="245" src="http://naviny.by/media/2008.05_w1/download/show/show-26.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Volha Khizhynkova, a 21-year-old resident of Brest, was named the winners of a biannual national beauty contest, Miss Belarus 2008, in a ceremony held in the Palace of Sports in Minsk on Friday night.<br /><br />She is said to be six feet one inch tall, with a hip size of 36 inches. Ms. Khizhynkova, an instructor at a vocational school, was awarded a 3.53-ounce white gold crown and a one-room apartment in Minsk’s Vyasnyanka neighborhood, which can be valued at more than $70,000. <br /><br />Attending the ceremony was Belarusian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka. <br /><br />More than 2,000 girls took part in the contest, with 26 advancing to the final. Thomas Anders of Germany, Philip Kirkorov of Russia and Belarusian pop singers Dzmitry Kaldun and Ruslan Alyakhno sang at the ceremony.<br /><br /><b><li><font color="#CC0A0A">Endnote...</font></B><br /><br /><H2 align=center><font color="#005B30">Belarus: Lukashenka Abandons Courtship Of West </font></H2><br />From: <a href="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/04/9e79d851-5cf8-48d9-91d3-2f519092e851.html" target="_blank">RFE/RL</a> <br /><table align="left"><tr><td><img src="http://gdb.rferl.org/8d61d1f5-1150-4ef5-b161-351aba0f933c_w220.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td align="center" width=""><b></b></td></tr></table>Dissidents are being rounded up. U.S. diplomats are being kicked out. And European officials are once again pointing accusing fingers at the continent's "last dictatorship."<br /><br />Belarus's tenuous and clumsy courtship of the West has decisively hit the skids. And in case there was any doubt, authoritarian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka made it clear in his annual speech to the nation on April 29 that the West had no right to demand the release of political prisoners. A day later, Belarusian authorities gave 10 U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.<br /><br />In his speech, Lukashenka used a particularly mocking tone -- and some colorful language -- in reference to the person the West has been pushing hardest to have freed: imprisoned opposition leader Alyaksandr Kazulin.<br /><br />"He wanted the entire world to make speeches to free him and for the Belarusian authorities to cave in under the pressure. Who needs you?" Lukashenka told the nation. "You are like used toilet paper, and you think somebody needs you."<br /><br />Kazulin, a former university rector, finished far behind Lukashenka in a 2006 election and was jailed for helping organize mass protests against the results. The United States and the European Union have called for Kazulin's release as a condition for better relations.

<strong>BEING HAD- </strong><br>
The BEING HAD Weblog project was created for the purposes of making a public forum for a case falsely made against me by a corrupt Polish judicial system in 2002 (Please see: <a href="http://beinghad.com/the_case.htm" target="_blank">The Case</a>). For the better part of a whole year I was not allowed to leave Poland and during that time I suffered endless damages to my name and to business. To this day I am still trying to get Poland to acknowledge what they did, and hence, this blog as well as all of the pages of Being Had continues on.  Being Had greatly needs your financial contributions though, both to keep going and to pay for legal and administrative fees involved in the case. Being Had also accepts advertising, offers investment opportunities and page sponsorships as well.

<p class="profile-textblock">I am an American and have been living in Belarus (Poland not withstanding)for a bit more than five years. I am a writer, having completed so far one book (Being Had), many articles and essays, an ongoing  Blog and 11 plays for theatre (including <a href="http://beinghad-pkrus.blogspot.com/">Pod Kablukom</a>, a play in Belarusian, Russian and English languages). I am a lifetime bicyclist and a supporter of global ecology. While in Belarus I have worked as a teacher of English and an editor of Russian/English translations. I have also worked in support of the school bike racing team here in Pinsk. To learn more about the BEING HAD web project, please click <a href="http://beinghad.com/about_beinghad.htm">HERE</a></p>
