It was working fine. While in the middle of printing colorful text (first pages were fine), I could see & hear that it was running out of ink, so I stopped it quickly. I immediately refilled the color that was missing, using a needle kit w/ink specifically designed for this cartridge (HP23). I put the cartridge back and it printed fine for about 1/4 page, then streaks. No amount of cleaning pages improved it. Obviously there's no clog (it was working mins ago) IMPORTANT: about a month ago, I refilled 2 of the 3 colors -- BEFORE they went empty -- in this same cartridge, and it was working fine! I smashed open the last cartridge. Has just a sponge in the reservoir, and metal screens at the print head, and membrane between the two areas. I don't understand the function, but I think my trouble is a 'feature' of the membrane. Can anyone help?</a>

It hasn't been used in months (years), so naturally I'd expect the cartridges to be dried. Using the printing services, I ran the printer through the 'clean' mode a few times. It can now print, but everything is blue and grainy. Upon Googling 'dried ink cartridge', I read that the use of rubbing alcohol can help loosen the ink. With some help of a nail polish remover, I was able to removed the blockage on the colored cartridge, but the black one remained clogged. I left the black one sitting on one of those sanitary wipes overnight, and the tissue had alot of ink on it the next morning. According to the 'estimated ink levels', both cartridges have atleast 85% of their ink, but they continue to print blue stripy images. Is there a way to clean them to print normally, or will I need to purchase new cartridges?</a>
