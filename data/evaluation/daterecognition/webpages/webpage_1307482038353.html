   <h3><a name="s1"></a>Food security in the WANA region, a burning issue</h3>
   <p>West Asia North Africa, the WANA Region, is characterised by a steadily 
    growing population. It is expected that the population will increase by a 
    further 60% till 2030 (<a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>). It is also assumed that, 
    by the year 2030, more than 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the population will live in 
    urban centres without the possibility of producing their own food.</p>

   <p>More people need more food and urbanization changes the diet. With increasing 
    income, people demand more animal protein, fruits and vegetables. Quality 
    and safety of food becomes an important determinant when selecting food from 
    the market (<a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>). ROSEGRANT <i>et al</i>. (1995) 
    prognoses that demand for meat and eggs in WANA will increase till 2020 by 
    47%, whereas the demand for wheat and rice will increase by 24% only. To supply 
    the population adequately with food, the countries of the WANA region have 
    to increase imports of wheat from currently 28.2 million tons (mt) to 41.6 
    mt within the next 20 years. Meat imports are expected to increase even more 
    drastically from currently 1.05 mt to 3.6 mt in 2020, adding substantially 
    to the budget requirement of the concerned countries.</p>

   <p>In consequence of the increasing demand for food and feed, the crop production 
    in WANA has to be increased substantially, also to control the expenses needed 
    to import food.</p>
   <p>However, availability of land and water is scarce in WANA.  The acreage 
    of arable land and permanent crops increased only slightly in the last two 
    decades by about 13% to currently 94 million ha. At the same time, the population 
    increased by 64% to currently 352 million inhabitants, which reduces the per 
    capita land availability from 0.38 ha in 1980 to currently 0.26 ha. In other 
    words, to feed the growing population, the productivity of the existing cropped 
    land has to be increased because horizontal expansion of crop production is 
    hardly possible. But in recent years, there has been little increase in cereal 
    yields in WANA, and yields have become more variable. Consequently, the per 
    capita cereal production is declining (<a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>) and this 
    widens the gap between cereal production and demand.</p>

   <h3><a name="s2"></a>Mineral fertilizers play a dominant role in increasing 
    productivity of the cultivated land</h3>
   <p>In the past, fertilizer use and cereal production in WANA developed fairly 
    parallel (<a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>). Use of mineral fertilizers increased 
    rapidly in the last three decades from 1 to currently 6 mt N+P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>+K<sub>2</sub>O. 
    During the same period, cereal production rose from some 40 to about 70-90 
    mt but with signs of stagnation during the last years. There is also a rather 
    serious decline in the apparent fertilizer use efficiency, FUE, which decreased 
    from some 35 kg cereals per kg NPK to currently 15 kg.</p>

   </table>
   <p>One of the factors responsible for stagnating yields and decreasing FUE 
    is the current unbalanced fertilizer use (<a href="#fig5">figure 5</a>). This 
    refers in particular to the ratio of nitrogen to potassium. About 2/3<sup>rd</sup> 
    of the applied nutrients consists of nitrogen, 25-30% of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> 
    and a meagre 5-7% of K<sub>2</sub>O. On average, the countries of WANA applied 
    39 kg/ha N, 17 kg/ha P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and 4 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O 
    (mean 1997-99). The highest N use is seen in Egypt with 289 kg/ha, applied 
    together with 41 and 10 kg/ha P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>O, respectively. Lebanon applied 
    the highest P rates with 104 kg/ha (together with 72 kg/ha N and 21 kg/ha 
    K<sub>2</sub>O), and Israel the highest K rates of 55 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O 
    with 93 kg/ha N and 34 kg/ha P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (mean 1997-99).</p>

    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The current N:K ratio in the fertilizers used is 1:0.08 that is 12 times 
    more N than K<sub>2</sub>O. This contrasts sharply with the ratio at which
    plants absorb these two nutrients. The N:K ratio is 1:1 in cereals and up
    to 1:1.5 in crops such as potatoes, vegetables or sugar beet. The very wide
    N:K ratio in the WANA region is wider than the average ratio of developing
    countries (N:K = 1:0.21) or the global average (N:K = 1:0.26).</p>
   <p>But, the N:K ratio differs substantially between the countries of the WANA 
    region (<a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>). Turkey and Egypt, the biggest fertilizer 
    consumers, apply N and K at a ratio of about 1:0.03. Iran improved considerably 
    fertilizer use within the last few years and changed the N:K ratio from 1:0.04 
    in 1997 to a current ratio of 1:0.23 (1999). Morocco (1:0.32) and Israel (1:0.59) 
    have a fairly balanced N:K ratio, and Algeria even a very close ratio of 1:0.77 
    (average of 1997-99).</p>

   <h3><a name="s3"></a>Unbalanced fertilization results in soil nutrient mining</h3>
   <p>In <a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>, there is a comparison between N removal 
    by crops and N fertilizer use in WANA. It shows that, during the 70ies, N 
    removal by crops exceeded N use, the deriving N balance was negative. The 
    situation changed rapidly during the last two decades, which shows N fertilizer 
    use and N removal by crops in almost similar quantities.</p>
   <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" align="center">

   </table>
   <p>A comparable situation appears in phosphorus (not shown). After an early 
    period of a negative balance, P use and P removal appear to be in equilibrium.</p>
   <p>A completely different picture is obtained when K removal by crops is related 
    to the use of potash (<a href="#fig8">figure 8</a>). K input with potash fertilizers 
    represents less than 10% of potassium that is taken up by plants and removed 
    with the harvest. The apparent K deficit is estimated at almost 4 million 
    t K<sub>2</sub>O annually or the equivalent of 37 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O. It 
    can be doubted that organic manure, although locally used for horticultural 
    crops, can close this gap in the K balance.</p>

    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The K balance is worst in Egypt with a deficit of 195 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O. 
    Farmers apply with potash fertilizers only a fraction (5%) of potassium that 
    is removed by the harvested crops. The K balance in other countries of WANA, 
    albeit being negative, is less serious than in Egypt. Farmers in Turkey and 
    Lebanon apply about 50 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O less than what is removed by crops, 
    the K deficit in the other countries range between 15 and 30 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O. 
    The exception is Israel, where potash use is well in balance with K removal 
    by crops.</p>
   <p>Negative nutrient balances indicate soil nutrient mining and thus loss in 
    soil fertility.</p>

   <h3><a name="s4"></a>What is the effect of soil K mining?</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><i>Sustainability of soil fertility</i>: Potassium in soils can be differentiated 
     into several fractions according to the availability. The soil K fractions 
     are interrelated to each other by dynamic exchange processes. K in soil solution 
     is immediately available to plant roots. After removing solution K either 
     by uptake or leaching, it is replenished by K from the exchangeable fraction, 
     which is a readily available pool. With exhaustion of this fraction, namely 
     at negative K balances and soil K mining, the plant has to rely on K released 
     from the less readily available pool of the non-exchangeable fraction. However, 
     the release rate of K from the non-exchangeable fraction is much smaller 
     than from the exchangeable fraction.<br>
     A high yielding crop absorbs K at a rate of up to 10 kg K<sub>2</sub>O/ha/day. 
     Failing to match K release from the soil into the solution with the demand 
     of the crop restricts plant growth and yield formation. The more the plant 
     has to rely on K release from the non-exchangeable fraction, the lower becomes 
     the yield.<br>
     Simultaneously, with depletion of the readily available K fraction, the clay 
     minerals start to fix potassium, which makes soil K less available (<a href="#fig9">figure 
     9</a>).<br>
     The same applies to ammonium. Plants grown on K fixing soils require a much 
     higher potash supply than on non-fixing soils and thus, have higher production 
     costs. NH<sub>4</sub> fixation of K depleted soils lowers the N fertilizer 
     use efficiency, which is also a cost factor.</li>

   <ul>
    <li><i>Yield</i>: Numerous field trials with a wide range of crops and soil 
     types could demonstrate that, with soil K mining, the yields decrease because 
     of deteriorating soil fertility. The results in <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a> 
     also show that the response of crops to soil K mining differs with the genotype. 
     Cereal, with its extended root system, is obviously more efficient to extract 
     soil K than dicots such as potato or sugar beet, which have a rather lax 
     root system. This also signals differences in potash requirement and should 
     lead to differentiate critical soil K limits according to the crop type and/or 
     crop rotation. <br>
     Significant yield responses to potash are also known in the WANA region. 
     EL HADI and ETOURNEAUD (1995) could demonstrate already in the early 90ies 
     that use of 60 kg/feddan K<sub>2</sub>O increased in the Nile delta of Egypt 
     yields of berseem, cotton, beans and several cereals by 4 to almost 10% although 
     those soils contain up to 500 ppm exchangeable potassium. Similar results 
     were obtained in Upper Egypt. BADRAOUI <i>et al</i>. (1997) showed with sugar 
     beet that investing one $ in potash returned up to eight $ through higher 
     yield.</li>

   <ul>
    <li><i>Quality</i>: Quality of agricultural products became the dominant factor 
     in selecting food at the market. Quality can be expressed according to the 
     nutritive value, hygienic and organoleptic properties, the functional properties, 
     and the compatibility with the environment at its production. Due to its 
     multi-functionality in the plant, potassium is considered as the nutrient 
     being most involved in quality production. Higher protein content in wheat, 
     oil content in soybean and groundnut, fibre content in cotton, better shelf-life 
     of fruits and vegetables are some of the findings from field trials with 
     potash (<a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>). AGBANI <i>et al</i>. (1999) reported 
     from Morocco that applying 150 kg/ha N and 300 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O has proved 
     to be the most effective combination for the highest extractable sugar content.</li>

   <ul>
    <li><i>Stress tolerance</i>: Nutrition of plants has a substantial impact 
     on the predisposition of plants to be attacked by pests and diseases. By 
     affecting the growth pattern, the anatomy, morphology and particularly the 
     chemical composition, the nutrition of plants may contribute either to an 
     increase or decrease the resistance and/or tolerance to pests and diseases. 
     The ratio between nitrogen and potassium plays obviously a particular role 
     in the host/pathogen relationship.<br>
     PERRENOUD (1990) reviewed almost 2450 literature references on this subject 
     and concluded that the use of potassium decreased the incidence of fungal 
     diseases in 70% of cases. The corresponding decrease of other pests was bacteria 
     69%, insects and mites 63% and viruses 41%. Simultaneously, K increased the 
     yield of plants infested with fungal diseases by 42%, with bacteria by 57%, 
     with insects and mites by 36%, and with viruses by 78% (<a href="#fig12">Figure 
     12</a>). <br>
     The function of potassium in plants as an osmotically active cation and
     its involvement in controlling the water household gives balanced fertilization
     with potash the unique opportunity to improve the tolerance of plants to
     drought, frost and to salinity. WYRWA <i>et al</i>. (1998) could demonstrate 
     that drought reduced grain yield of triticale by 54% on soils low in K whereas, 
     at adequate potash supply, the grain yield was reduced only marginally by 
     16%. This refers to the function of potassium to control stomata movement 
     and thus, the water release at drought stress.<br>
     BOGDEVITCH (2000) showed that oat grown on soils with 234 ppm K could survive 
     late frost without obvious damage whereas oat on K deficient soil (132 ppm 
     K) was almost wiped out. K in plant cells lowers the freezing point that 
     protects the plant from frost damage provided there is adequate supply to 
     the plant.<br>
     Shoot weight of salt affected barley was increased when additional K was 
     applied (HELAL &amp; MENGEL, 1979). The plants treated with extra K had also 
     a higher K and lower Na content in the shoot and showed a much better N conversion 
     into protein than the salt affected plants without the &#147;meliorative&#148; 
     extra K.</li>

   <ul>
    <li><i>Compatibility with the environment</i>: Lower yields in field trials 
     at unbalanced fertilization with inadequate potash imply that the use efficiency 
     of the other fertilizer nutrients is decreased. In this context, DOBERMANN 
     (1999) showed in field trials with rice that the recovery efficiency of N 
     increased from 26% at low K (20 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O) to 36% at adequate 
     K (80 kg/ha K<sub>2</sub>O). This means that less N is left in the rooting 
     zone at adequate K supply, which otherwise could pollute the groundwater 
     when leached or contribute to global warming when volatilized. With lower 
     yield, use efficiency of other inputs such as land, water and energy decreases 
     as well. Therefore, insufficient supply of potash leads to waste of natural 
     resources, it is a threat to the environment and reduces the profit of the 
     farmer.

   </ul>
   <h3><a name="s5"></a>What are the benefits of balanced fertilization for the 
    society?</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><i>Yield and income</i>: Lower yield at insufficient potash supply is 
     synonymous to loosing opportunity yield and income (Figure 10). The farmer 
     could obtain higher yields and income with adequate potash supply. With higher 
     income, the farmer is inclined to spend more money for non-agricultural products. 
     This attracts other business, creates jobs and contributes to the development 
     of the rural area. He also may stay on his farm and will not migrate into 
     urban area because, with higher income, he gains in social security.</li>
    <li><i>Quality and competitiveness</i>: In most of the crop markets, the procurement 
     price is based on quality criteria, such as protein or oil content in cereal 
     and oil seeds, sugar content in beets and cane, or simply by freshness and 
     appearance of fruits and vegetables. Farmers being paid according to the 
     quality will loose their competitiveness at the market when producing crops 
     with inferior quality. Lower procurement prices for crops poor in nutritive 
     value shrink his income and profit from farming. Apart from the direct impact, 
     there is also an indirect benefit of quality-oriented production to the society, 
     for instance in sugar production: each percent sugar less in sugar beets 
     requires about 6% more beets to be transported and extracted to yield the 
     same amount of white sugar. The higher energy consumption and lower profitability 
     in extracting low quality beets are obvious. Furthermore, the higher content 
     of noxious N in sugar beets at unbalanced fertilization with inadequate potash 
     lowers in addition the sugar extraction.</li>
    <li><i>Stress tolerance</i>: Less pest and disease incidences at balanced 
     fertilization reduce the need for agrochemicals, reduce the storage losses, 
     especially in fruits and vegetables, and the marketable crops have a better 
     appearance. This lowers the production costs and increases the competitiveness 
     at the market when offering healthy and safe products. One should also not 
     forget that, in an age of globalization and liberalized international trade, 
     quality such as freedom from pests and diseases became an important non-tariff 
     trade barrier. In not complying with the hygienic standards set by the importing 
     country, the market is quickly lost.<br>
     Variable yields when plants are vulnerable to climatic and soil-borne stress 
     are not only a financial risk for the producer but also impair the planning 
     of the food supply of the nation.</li>
    <li><i>Compatibility with the environment</i>: Consumers will ask more than 
     before whether food is produced in accordance with the environment. This 
     refers in particular to agricultural products. The rapidly increasing market 
     of so-called &#145;bio&#146;-product gives evidence of this development. 
     A higher N fertilizer use efficiency, less pest and disease incidences at 
     balanced fertilization with adequate potash comply with the requirement of 
     safeguarding the environment in agricultural production.</li>

   <h3><a name="s6"></a>Conclusion</h3>
   <p>Extended soil K mining as practised in WANA is a time bomb. It prevents 
    the full exploitation of the genetic potential that modern high yielding varieties 
    contain. By that, unbalanced fertilization deprives the farmer to gain maximum 
    profit from his cultivated fields, which in turn might force him to abandon 
    his fields and to migrate into towns where he adds to the growing number of 
    the poor.</p>
   <p>Prevention of full exploitation of the genetic potential of crops at unbalanced 
    fertilization also means missing the opportunity to improve food supply of 
    the population and to lower the bill for costly imports. The money saved on 
    imports at higher domestic crop production could be spent for other purposes.</p>
   <p>Preventing better crop quality due to unbalanced fertilization lowers the 
    competitiveness at the local and international market. Export of fruits and 
    vegetables from Near East increased in the last 20 years from 3.11 mt worth 
    $1.46 billion to currently 6.5 million t worth $4.26 billion (mean 1997-99, 
    FAO-web 2002). It would be interesting to estimate the gain in export quantity 
    and value if balanced fertilization would be applied to all crops.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, better quality of conventionally cultivated crops at 
    balanced fertilization helps the farmer to comply with the demand to produce 
    enough as well as &#147;healthy&#148; and safe food. Good governance also 
    in respect of nutrient management proves his reliability and gives him advantages 
    at the market. </p>
   <p>Furthermore, balanced fertilization and by that, improving use efficiency 
    of fertilizers, nitrogen in particular, would not only contribute to protect 
    the environment and to safeguard natural resource. It, if promoted by the 
    whole fertilizer industry, would also improve the image of an industry, which 
    is under close observation from the public. This refers in the same way to 
    the farmer and the fertilizer producer.</p>
   <p>It is high time to turn to balanced fertilization in WANA.</p>
