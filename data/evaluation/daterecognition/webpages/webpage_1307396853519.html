Mariotti shipyard in Genoa, Italy." BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>Seabourn took delivery of the new 450-guest Seabourn Quest today at the T. Mariotti shipyard in Genoa, Italy.  The intimate, all-suite ship is the third vessel constructed by Mariotti for Seabourn's fleet, completing a three-year expansion that increased the ultra-luxury line's capacity by more than 200 percent.

<p>"We are very pleased and excited to take delivery of Seabourn Quest," said Richard Meadows, Seabourn's President.  "She is a beautiful vessel, and I have no doubt she will earn as much praise from the experts, and as much affection from our guests as her two sister-ships.  Her officers, staff and crew are ready to welcome travelers on board to experience Seabourn-style cruising on our newest ship."

<p>Emmy and Tony Award-winning actress Blythe Danner will serve as godmother and name the ship during a glittering sunset ceremony at the port of Barcelona on June 20, 2011.  That evening, the ship will depart on a 14-day Maiden Voyage to Athens, stopping at the sort of beautiful seaside towns in France, Italy, Greece and Turkey that are a hallmark of the Seabourn cruise experience.

<p>Seabourn Quest's maiden season includes seven-day Eastern Mediterranean cruises, operating alternately between Athens and Istanbul, and Venice and Athens, as well as a seven-day Black Sea voyage. In the fall, the ship will cruise across the Atlantic Ocean from Malaga, Spain, to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., from where it will sail on a series of round trip voyages in the Caribbean. On January 5, 2012, Seabourn Quest will begin a 109-day Maiden World Cruise from Ft. Lauderdale to Venice on a unique eastbound course via South America, South Africa, the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean.  

<p>Seabourn Quest is the third iteration of the sleek and widely admired design that first appeared as Seabourn Odyssey in June 2009, and has been hailed as "a game-changer for the luxury segment." The second sister-ship, Seabourn Sojourn, entered service in June of 2010.

Also completing dry-dock refurbishments in April were ms Eurodam, ms Volendam and ms Veendam. 

<p>The 1,258-guest Maasdam's added facilities and features included new stateroom furnishings and bathroom upgrades; Canaletto, a complimentary Italian eatery; the sophisticated Showroom at Sea; and the stylish lounge called Mix, which combines three distinct bars into one area. Twenty-nine new Lanai staterooms also were added to Maasdam during the refit, and 16 staterooms across Verandah Suite, Outside and Inside categories were converted into Spa Staterooms. The refurbishment was part of the company's now more than $566 million Signature of Excellence ongoing fleet-wide program.

<p>"Maasdam is our fifth ship to receive these exciting enhancements," said Richard Meadows, CTC, executive vice president, marketing, sales and guest programs.  "The ongoing Signature of Excellence program has touched all 15 Holland America ships in various ways and ensures that our fleet continues to evolve in premium amenities, programming, technologies and activities that our guests expect from Holland America Line." 

<p>Volendam's dry dock in Singapore included new carpet in most of the public areas and restaurants. Audio and lighting enhancements were completed in the show lounge.  Guest staterooms received new carpeting and soft goods, and all furniture was re-upholstered and refinished. Crew cabins and recreation areas were also updated. The hull was repainted and a number of technical maintenance repairs were performed.

<p>Eurodam's dry dock at Freeport involved new carpets, privacy curtains along the Atrium side of the Pinnacle Grill, hull coating and some routine technical upgrades.  Veendam's dry dock, also at Freeport, included routine technical updates.  The aft Lido Deck retreat area was modified with a new design with more open deck space, two pools and two hot tubs. 

<p>Canaletto, a complimentary casual Italian restaurant, was added to ms Maasdam and comes to life for dinner when a section of the Lido is transformed with glass partitions and an Italian ambiance with dishes such as putanesca and penne alla vodka.  Although there is no charge to dine in Canaletto, reservations are suggested.  

<p>Maasdam's piano bar and casino bar were reconfigured into Mix, a multi-themed area with three separate bars: Martinis, Champagne and Spirits & Ales, each serving its namesake libations. The casino was redesigned and the main show lounge was transformed into the Showroom at Sea with nightclub ambiance. 

<p>The upscale Merabella luxury jewelry shop was added to the completely renovated mid-ship shopping area with its signature jewelry and watch boutiques. Other public areas around the ship also were refurbished and received new carpeting.

<p>In addition to Maasdam, these extensive public area Signature of Excellence enhancements can also be found on Veendam, ms Statendam, ms Rotterdam and ms Ryndam. 

<p>Completing the decor enhancements, Maasdam's staterooms received new carpeting, soft goods and completely renovated bathrooms with new vanities and cabinetry. 

<p>Sixteen staterooms near the Greenhouse Spa on Verandah Deck were converted to "spa staterooms" featuring a variety of enhanced amenities. Spa accommodations offer exclusive items such as organic cotton bathrobes and slippers, a yoga mat, a soothing water feature, special room-service menus and treatments, and more.

</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
For the first time, Carnival Cruise Lines will operate an extended schedule of voyages from Boston with a series of round-trip four- and five-day eastern Canada cruises aboard the 2,974-passenger Carnival Glory beginning in June 2012.  Carnival will be the only cruise line offering short cruises from Boston to the Canadian Maritimes. 

<p><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cc_glory_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cc_glory.jpg" ALT="For the first time, Carnival Cruise Lines will operate an extended schedule of voyages from Boston with a series of round-trip four- and five-day eastern Canada cruises aboard the 2,974-passenger Carnival Glory beginning in June 2012." BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>On the new program, Carnival Glory will sail from the recently refurbished Black Falcon Cruise Terminal on four-day "long weekend" cruises departing Thursdays to Saint John, New Brunswick, and five-day voyages departing Mondays and Saturdays to Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Saint John.  The program will operate June 10 to July 26, 2012.  A special seven-day cruise will be offered June 3-10, 2012, with visits to Portland, Maine; and Saint John, Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia.

<p>"We are thrilled to offer these four- and five-day cruises from Boston which is not only a world-class destination but also provides a convenient and affordable drive-to homeport for millions of Northeastern U.S. residents," said Gerry Cahill, Carnival's president and CEO.   "Carnival Glory is a fantastic �Fun Ship' with so much to offer and on these cruises guests can visit charming and historic cities in eastern Canadian Maritimes while enjoying all the fun and excitement that Carnival is known for."

<p>"Massport's facilities are economic engines for the New England region and we expected our $11 million in capital improvements to the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal would not only be appreciated by the more than 300,000 passengers who use the facility each year, but it would generate renewed interest from cruise lines in the Port of Boston," said Thomas J. Kinton Jr., Massport's CEO & Executive Director. "Bringing Carnival Cruise Lines to Boston for regularly scheduled service is not only good economic news, it will provide New England residents more choices in cruising vacations."

<p>"We are pleased to welcome Carnival Cruise Lines to Boston, and will work to make their Boston-Canada sailings a success," said Mike Leone, Massport's Director of the Port. "Carnival Glory provides a great opportunity for New Englanders and others to enjoy Eastern Canada during the summer months, and the shorter itineraries will be a huge draw for those with limited vacation time or who are looking to getaway for an extended weekend."

<p>Saint John is a nature lover's paradise, highlighted by such landmarks as Reversing Falls, where the highest tides in the world intersect with the St. John River and force it to flow backwards twice daily, and the Bay of Fundy, with its gorgeous backdrop of rugged rock formations. Also popular is Saint John's Historic District, lined with stately Victorian homes, elegant churches and quaint boutiques and eateries.

<p>Founded in 1749 and known as the "Gateway to the Canadian Atlantic," Halifax is a charming yet cosmopolitan city with outstanding restaurants, shops, and museums and unique cultural experiences. Here, guests can visit Peggy's Cove, a fishing village famous for its granite coastline, tour the city's many lighthouses, or observe the changing of the guard at The Citadel, a centuries-old fortress.  Other on-shore activities such as kayaking and hiking are also available.

<p>Guests can also experience the many on-board facilities and features of the Carnival Glory � a 270-square-foot Seaside Theatre poolside LED screen displaying movies, concerts and other programming, a 13,300-square foot spa, four swimming pools � one with the line's signature Twister Waterslide � along with spacious and modern play areas for children, 'tweens and teens, and Serenity, an exclusive adults-only retreat.  A wide range of dining venues � from twin full-service dining rooms and a two-level casual poolside eatery featuring a 24-hour pizzeria to a sushi bar and a classic American steakhouse � are available, as well.  

<p>Following its cruises from Boston, Carnival Glory will reposition to New York for a series of four-day voyages to Saint John and five-day voyages to Saint John and Halifax from August 1 through September 3, 2012.  Carnival Glory will also offer five week-long fall foliage cruises round-trip from New York to Halifax, Saint John, Boston and Portland, Maine.   Departure dates include September 8, 15, 22, and 29 and October 6, 2012.                               

<p>The ship will also operate a series of cruises round-trip from Norfolk, Va., in the spring and fall.  Spring six-day Bahamas departures will be available on May 15, 21 and 27.  In the fall, there will be a six-day Bahamas cruise on October 14 and 22; a five-day Bahamas cruise on October 28, and a special two-day cruise on October 20, 2012.

BORDER="0" ALIGN="right"></A>Continuing its commitment to "Partners First," Norwegian Cruise Line announced today that several new tools have been launched to support meeting planners in exploring and booking meetings, incentive groups and corporate events (MICE) aboard its fleet of 11 Freestyle Cruising� ships.

<p>A new MICE website has launched to fully meet the needs of meeting and incentive groups, as well as full ship charters. Planners and buyers can visit www.events.ncl.com to find supporting tools and frequently asked questions. The site outlines the planning process and showcases all the features and flexible options available to MICE groups.  An accompanying planning brochure details the benefits of choosing a cruise over a land-based resort for a corporate event or meeting. It also lists the advantages of utilizing a cruise ship for MICE groups including the ability to visit multiple destinations, flexible dining options, personalized services and access to all the amenities and features of the ship.  The brochure contains a pull-out fleet guide that provides a comprehensive comparison of group space and options for each of Norwegian's 11 ships.  

<p>Travel partners that are enrolled in NCL University, Norwegian Cruise Line's online educational program, have the opportunity to take a MICE specific course. The class, which details how Norwegian's fleet has been specifically designed to accommodate groups, is a way for travel partners who may not be familiar with groups to learn the best approach. 

<p>"Norwegian Cruise Line offers the freedom to create a program that is tailor-fit to the group, the flexibility to design the experience around business needs as well as a variety of entertainment, dining times and cuisines to choose from," said Patrick Mitchell, vice president of global sales, strategy and planning. "These additional resources increase the ease of use for our partners."

<p>In addition to the new website and collateral, the Norwegian MICE team has been visiting key markets, including New York City and Atlanta in a series of road shows. These educational seminars showcase how MICE groups are valuable for travel partners and demonstrate the best way to attract them. Upcoming MICE events are scheduled in Chicago and Toronto. To learn more about Norwegian's meetings, incentives and corporate events, order a brochure or to register for an upcoming event, please visit www.events.ncl.com

BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>Sea Princess recently hosted a group of 25 new graduates from Guide Dogs for the Blind and their owners for the day in San Francisco, to familiarize them with how Princess Cruises can accommodate visually impaired travelers and their canine companions.

<p>The group was able to enjoy a tour of the ship and lunch in the dining room, while learning how Princess can provide for their needs and those of their dogs. The event was hosted in association with Dimensions in Travel, a travel agency that regularly organizes travel for Guide Dogs for the Blind clients, to give new guide dog users a feel for what to expect if they join one of the agency's group cruises, or travel independently. Since 2004, Princess has hosted 11 Guide Dogs for the Blind groups on cruises to destinations such as Mexico and Alaska.

<p>"Working with these clients has changed the way we travel," said Diana Saint James, owner of Dimensions in Travel. "It's not all about what we see when we travel anymore -- it's all of our senses. That's what our relationship with our blind travelers has taught us. It's a different way to see the world."

<p>Aboard Sea Princess guests were able to test out many of the special features offered for visually impaired travelers and their dogs. For the dogs, the ships provide special life jackets, bowls of water in the dining room, and relieving boxes with favored cedar chips. Passengers also have specially translated menus and can enjoy reserved seating in the Princess Theater with room for their dogs. During a cruise, passengers and crew are also invited to meet the dogs during a designated play time.

<p>"These dogs are canine heroes," said Brian Rademacher, Princess Cruises district sales manager. "It's truly a labor of love for us to work with this wonderful organization."

The line selected the homeport of Rotterdam because of the company's deep historical connection to the city as well its easily accessible location in Northwest Europe.

<p>Itineraries being released through spring 2013 include several regional sailings ranging from 14 to 18 days, and two extended voyages that sail 34 and 90 days.

<p>"The city of Rotterdam is where Holland America Line has its roots, and for us to place a ship there year-round is sentimental, exciting and ground-breaking for our line and our guests," said Richard Meadows, CTC, executive vice president, marketing, sales and guest programs. "Sailing from Rotterdam is going to be a wonderful homeport for many of our European guests, but these longer itineraries also will appeal to travelers coming from all over the world."

<p>After concluding its previously announced summer season throughout Europe, ms Rotterdam sails Sept. 15, 2012 on a 14-day Spain & Portugal Explorer cruise that takes guests through the Strait of Gibraltar to Barcelona, Spain, also calling at ports in Portugal along the way there and back.

<p>Two 17-day explorations in September and October take different routes. The Sept. 29 Moorish Empire voyage sails through the Strait of Gibraltar to Civitavecchia (Rome), Italy, and back, calling at popular ports in Spain and Portugal, while the Oct. 16 Canary Island Adventure heads south to the Canary Islands and Morocco, with overnight calls at Funchal, Madeira, Portugal and Tenerife, Canary Islands. The 18-day Canary Island Holiday departs Dec. 22 and offers the same ports of call with an additional overnight at Tenerife to celebrate the New Year. The April 9, 2013, 19-day Canary Island Adventure takes the same route as the holiday cruise but adds a call at Portimao, Portugal.

<p>Departing Nov. 2, 2012, ms Rotterdam sets sail from the port of Rotterdam on a round-trip 34-day Caribbean Odyssey adventure that takes the ship across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean and back. After calling at the Azores, the ship sails to the Caribbean, with calls at Tortola, St. Maarten, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Barbados and all three "ABC" islands � Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao � before returning to Rotterdam via calls at Funchal, Madeira, Portugal and Southampton, England.

<p>Guests looking for a unique adventure can embark on ms Rotterdam's 90-day Passage to the Far East cruise that departs Jan. 9, 2013. The round-trip Rotterdam voyage takes an easterly route to Asia, passing through the Suez Canal and calling at ports in Spain, Greece and India, both before and after a far-reaching journey to the Far East. Guests will enjoy several overnight stays and extended time in port during calls throughout Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore. Another cruise highlight includes an in-depth two-week exploration of Indonesia, a place rich in Dutch heritage, as well as home to many Holland America crew. In addition to the full 90-day voyage, segments ranging from 12 to 53 days are available.

<p><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news_di_fantasy_atrium_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_di_fantasy_atrium.jpg" ALT="The magnificent three-deck atrium lobby on the Disney Fantasy is reminiscent of grand ocean liners of the Golden Age." BORDER="0" ALIGN="Left"></A>The Disney Fantasy is the second of two newly designed Disney Cruise Line ships that take the family cruise experience to new heights. Sister ship to the Disney Dream, which entered service in January 2011, the 4,000-passenger Disney Fantasy will sail week-long Caribbean cruises from Port Canaveral, Fla., with its maiden voyage scheduled for March 31, 2012.

<p>Animator's Palate on the Disney Fantasy brings the magic of Disney animation into the dining room with a new show called "Animation Magic."  The dinner show celebrates the magic of Disney animation and allows families to create and participate in a whole new way.

<p>Like Animator's Palate on the Disney Dream, the venue is wall-to-wall whimsy inspired by a classic animation studio. Throughout the restaurant, pillars are fashioned like huge pencils and brushes. Character sketches, maquettes (three-dimensional character models), film strips and other tools of the animation trade adorn the room.  As a special nod to Mickey Mouse, the dining room chairs feature red and yellow colors and a trademark design � Mickey Mouse pants with two bright yellow buttons.

<p>Upon entering Animator's Palate, guests are surrounded by artwork featuring their favorite Disney characters.  Guests get a sneak peek into the origins of these beloved characters through concept art, storyboards and character studies.

<p>As guests are seated at their tables, they are invited to draw a character of their own using a simple template on their placemat.  Then, just before dinner, house lights dim and a sprinkling of pixie dust illuminates the room.  

<p>Imagery is revealed on several large monitors showing animated, black and white drawings of Mickey Mouse.  Mickey then places the Sorcerer's hat upon his head which transforms him, as well as all of the other pencil drawings shown throughout the room, from black and white to color.

<p>Mickey then invites guests to sit back, relax and enjoy a taste of animation as a montage of memorable food-themed moments from Disney and Pixar films set to "Be Our Guest" begins to delight guests.  After the "Be Our Guest" number is complete, animated curtains are drawn on the monitors for a brief intermission. During this time, guests are encouraged to complete their own drawings, if they have not already done so, so they may be whisked off to Mickey Mouse who is conjuring a magical final act.

<p>While guests enjoy dinner, the restaurant's walls fill with classic Disney and Pixar characters gathering food, eating and drinking together, and celebrating over meals.

<p>After dinner, the animated curtains are opened on the screens and Sorcerer Mickey returns for the exciting finale.  With a flourish and musical crescendo, Mickey works magic as only Disney can do.  Mickey conjures the guests' drawings � now fully animated and brought to life � into the onscreen action.

<p>A parade starts as Mickey leads the guests' drawings in a march across the screens around the dining room.  The animation of the drawings becomes increasingly more elaborate, and then the drawings step into scenes from beloved Disney movies and skip, skate and dance side-by-side with characters such as Mickey Mouse, Jiminy Cricket, Cinderella and Snow White.

<p>At the conclusion of the show, Mickey returns to say "so long" to the guests and, as he does, credits roll on screen showing each guest's name listed as a guest animator. To commemorate the experience, each guest will have their character drawing returned to them, with an added touch� a golden seal proclaiming them an Official Disney Animator.

<p>On the Disney Fantasy, adult guests step into a world that's all their own at Europa � a nighttime entertainment district exclusively for guests 18 and older that features sophisticated bars and trendy lounges inspired by the very best in European travel.

<p>� La Piazza is a lounge that draws inspiration from Italian cities and their decorative outdoor plazas. The bar is modeled after a colorful vintage carousel. Venetian masks, romantic couples' booths and a classic Vespa with a sidecar add Italian flair. 

<p>� Skyline is a chic bar that provides ever-changing birds-eye views of stunning European city skylines that transform from day to night. Skyline's "windows to the world" give guests a glimpse of spectacular locales in panorama such as Paris, London, Barcelona, Athens and St. Petersburg. 

<p>� O'Gill's Pub is a rollicking Irish bar with modern-day twists.  Dark woods, brass accents and a selection of Irish beers create the perfect pub atmosphere where guests can sip a pint while watching live sporting events on one of several high-definition televisions. 

<p>� Ooh La La is inspired by an elegant French boudoir adorned with velvet tufted walls, Victorian furniture and Louis XIV-style chaise lounges. A sensuous color palette is accented with ornate framed mirrors, gold details and a "jewel box" feature bar backed with sparkling diamond-like facets. 

<p>� The Tube transports guests to a vibrant metropolitan club via the London Underground. Guests "mind the gap" as they walk across a Tube route map, lounge among mod furniture, pose by a red English phone booth, dance atop an illuminated Union Jack dance floor and enjoy cocktails at a bar inspired by Big Ben and London's many train stations. 

<p>A new ship means new main stage entertainment at the 1,340-seat Walt Disney Theatre.  New to Disney Cruise Line, "Disney's Aladdin � A Musical Spectacular" takes the stage on the Disney Fantasy.  During this Broadway-style production, guests laugh along with the wise-cracking Genie and the cast from the classic animated Disney film, "Aladdin."  

<p>In this fast-paced musical comedy, Aladdin is back as the "street rat" of Agrabah meeting up with a Genie who grants him three wishes, battling the evil Jafar, and falling in love with Princess Jasmine.

<p>Many of the classic scenes and songs from the movie are re-created on stage and some of the action even spills out into the aisles, like Prince Ali's jubilant arrival in Agrabah on the back of a stallion. Magic lamps, wise-cracking genies, princesses and evil wizards are all part of this musical production. And of course, an Aladdin production would not be complete without a magic flying carpet scene, which combines mechanical wizardry with state-of-the-art projections, allowing Jasmine and Aladdin to soar as they perform a heartfelt duet of "Whole New World."

<p>Many of the songs from the movie are featured in the 45-minute musical production, including "Friend Like Me," which is performed as a lively, Las Vegas-style production number featuring special effects, illusions and more than a dozen dancing genies. Composer Alan Menken, who created the original soundtrack with songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice, composed an original song for the stage production entitled "To Be Free."

<p>At Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique on the Disney Fantasy, aspiring young princesses and pirates receive the full fairy tale treatment with pixie-dusted and piratical makeovers at this very special salon.  

<p>When young princesses-to-be make their royal entrance at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, they are greeted by their very own Fairy Godmother-in-training who transform them with magical makeovers such as the Disney Diva, the Pop Princess or the Fairy Tale Princess. A variety of royal treatment packages include combinations of hairstyle, shimmering makeup and nails. Princess costumes, complete with crown, wand and shoes also are available.

<p>Exclusive to Disney Cruise Line, Captain Mickey Mouse, Princess Minnie Mouse and First Mate Minnie Mouse makeovers plus special Under the Sea packages will be offered.

<p>On pirate party nights aboard the Disney Fantasy, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique transforms into the Pirate's League, where swashbuckling boys, girls and grownups can get ready for the pirate life. 

<p>Each guest checking in at the plunder-filled pirate's lair gets an official pirate name.  Then it's off to Muster Station for applications of beards and bandanas, swords and scars, earrings and eye patches � all done with the savvy skill of a pirate master who shares his own tales of sea-sailing adventures.

<p>After the new buccaneers recite a sacred pirate oath, they are officially part of Captain Jack's motley crew, leaving their old identities behind.  The shipmates and scoundrels are then turned loose on their pirate vessel.

<p>Guests can choose from two pirate packages � First Mate (includes bandana, facial scars tattoos, fake teeth, earring, eye patch, sword and sheath) or Empress (includes bandana, shimmering makeup, face gem, tattoos, nail polish, earring, eye patch, sword and sheath).

<p>The magnificent three-deck atrium lobby on the Disney Fantasy is reminiscent of grand ocean liners of the Golden Age.  Art Nouveau-inspired details and patterns in hues of vibrant blue, green, pink and gold lend to the sophistication.  Glamorous and graceful design elements include a sweeping grand staircase, towering fluted columns, grand piano and an exquisite marble and stone inlay floor. A focal point is a cascading chandelier of stained glass and crystal beads.

<p>The pi�ce de r�sistance of the magnificent space is the atrium lobby statue � Mademoiselle Minnie Mouse.  Inspired by travel of the 1920s and 1930s, Minnie, cast in bronze and dressed in vintage fashion with a parasol and steamer luggage at her side, serves to welcome all guests who board the ship.

<p>At Royal Court restaurant, guests are immersed in the lavish surroundings of an elegant dining room fit for a grand palace.  Royal Court takes design inspiration from the classic Disney films "Cinderella," "Snow White," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Sleeping Beauty."  D�cor features ornate details and custom furnishings and fixtures that incorporate iconic symbols from the films � glass slippers, apples, roses and tiaras.

<p>An Austrian glass chandelier is a focal point, while eight custom brass and glass lighting fixtures modeled after Cinderella's coach adorn the room.  Hand-crafted mosaic tile murals of the princesses � Cinderella, Snow White, Belle, Jasmine, Ariel and Sleeping Beauty (Aurora) � and their princes grace the walls.  Inspired by the mosaic tile murals in Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom, the Disney Fantasy mosaics are being meticulously created by skilled Italian craftspeople using more than 200,000 individual tiles, with 23 mosaic panels depicting six different vignettes.

<p>With careful attention to detail, many of the restaurant's features are modeled precisely from the inspirational films. The Royal Court's chandeliers, chair backs and columns with marble bases and fluted tops are fashioned after those seen in "Beauty and the Beast."  Wall sconces, decorative patterns, throne-style chairs and the circular floor plan are recreated from "Cinderella."

<p>The Disney Fantasy will depart on her maiden voyage March 31, 2012, and will sail out of Port Canaveral on seven-night Caribbean itineraries � alternating eastern (St. Maarten and St. Thomas) and western (Grand Cayman, Costa Maya, Cozumel). Special Eastern Caribbean sailings in November and December 2012 stop at St. Thomas and San Juan, Puerto Rico.  All Disney Fantasy itineraries include a stop at Disney's private island, Castaway Cay.

BORDER="0" ALIGN="Left"></A>Last Wednesday, May 18, marked the one-year anniversary of the launch of Charleston's first year-round cruise program aboard the Carnival Fantasy.

<p>Over the past year, Carnival Fantasy has operated 65 voyages from Charleston carrying approximately 140,000 passengers on fun-filled five- to seven-day voyages to the Bahamas, Grand Turk, Key West and Bermuda.

<p>Charleston has become one of the line's highest-rated homeports, consistently earning top marks for its convenient location, charming downtown area, outstanding shops, boutiques and restaurants and the gracious hospitality of its residents. Many Carnival guests opt for a pre- or post-cruise stay in Charleston, providing additional economic benefit to the local economy.

<p>Carnival has also partnered with local organizations to provide sponsorship and fundraising support.  These organizations include the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Children's Hospital, with Carnival providing in-kind and monetary donations and fundraisers.  Carnival Fantasy employees also make quarterly visits with patients and the company has donated mobile entertainment units and laptops to the hospital.

<p>For the past two years, the company has also sponsored the Cooper River Bridge Run and this year the company hosted a unique fundraising event � Race to the Altar in which a couple was married after the race and Carnival making a $10,000 donation to MUSC Children's Hospital.

</TABLE>
<A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_ws_wind_surf_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_ws_wind_surf.jpg" ALT="Court Approves Sale of Windstar" BORDER="0" ALIGN="right"></A>Ambassadors International, Inc. ("Ambassadors") today this week that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware has granted an order approving the sale of substantially all of Ambassadors' assets, including its principal operating unit, Windstar Cruises, to TAC Cruise LLC, an affiliate of Xanterra Holding Corporation.  The sale is expected to close next week.  

<p>All of Windstar's luxury yachts are sailing as scheduled, serving customers and guests with a high level of attention to their travel experience. 

<p>During a court-supervised competitive bidding process in compliance with Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, TAC Cruise LLC submitted a winning bid of $39 million in cash. 

<p>Windstar will be operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xanterra Holding Corporation of Greenwood Village, CO.  Xanterra Holding Corporation and its affiliates have operated in the hospitality and leisure industry for more than 100 years.

<p>"Windstar emerged as a tremendous long-term opportunity due to the line's exceptional product, loyal following and high level of guest satisfaction in the luxury travel market," said  Andrew N. Todd, CEO of Xanterra Holding Corporation.  "Xanterra intends to maintain Windstar's business and operations and to invest in Windstar's growth following the close of the sale."  

<p>Hans Birkholz, CEO of Ambassadors and Windstar, said, "Windstar is very pleased with the successful outcome of this sale process and expects to complete it by early next week.  Windstar is excited to have its new owner join in building Windstar's world class brand.  Windstar will be well-positioned for long-term profitability and success under new ownership and we will continue to provide exceptional service and extraordinary luxury travel experiences for our guests." 

<p>It is expected that Ambassadors' stockholders and holders of Ambassadors' convertible notes will not receive any distribution following the sale and these securities will likely have little, if any, value following Ambassadors' Chapter 11 proceeding.

P&O Cruises has taken delivery of the latest addition to its fleet, Adonia.

<p>Adonia is currently in the Bahamas undertaking a refit before coming to Southampton for her inaugural celebrations and maiden season.

<p><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_po_adonia_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_po_adonia.jpg" ALT="One of the small ships of Princess Cruises, the 710-passenger Royal Princess, will depart the line's fleet in spring 2011, transferring to sister company P&O Cruises in the U.K. The ship will be renamed Adonia." BORDER="0" ALIGN="right"></A>At  30,000 tonnes and carrying just 710 passengers, Adonia is able to reach many lesser visited, off the beaten track, ports of call, yet is big enough to provide an extensive range of modern on board facilities. Exclusively for adults, Adonia will offer an atmosphere that is intimate and refined � and the on board excellence for which the company is renowned.  

<p>Adonia will be named by Dame Shirley Bassey, DBE in a glittering ceremony in Southampton on Saturday May 21, 2011. Dame Shirley will be joined on the stage by actor Hugh Bonneville, most recently acclaimed as the Earl of Grantham in ITV's Downton Abbey and soon to appear in a nautical Captain's role in �Dr Who'.

<p>"Dame Shirley is Britain's most successful female artiste ever; a national treasure who defines the word �superstar', Hugh is one of Britain's most popular actors. We are Britain's favourite and most successful cruise line and can trace our roots back further than any other line. All in all it's a perfect combination and one which will give Adonia the best start to her life with P&O Cruises" said P&O Cruises managing director, Carol Marlow.

<p>"Adonia will be the jewel in the P&O Cruises crown and will celebrate all those things our regular passengers love about cruising with us � a classic dance floor, Crow's Nest observation lounge, formal nights, classical music recitals, guest speakers, silver service dining and a dedicated card room. Loyal cruisers and those new to cruising alike will be charmed by the refined P&O Cruises experience Adonia will offer," continued Carol Marlow.

<p>Over 500 invited guests will witness the naming ceremony on Adonia's Lido deck in Southampton Docks on Saturday, May 21, prior to the vessel's maiden voyage the following day, a 16 night cruise to the Western Mediterranean, which includes calls to Alghero in Sardinia; Portofino in Italy; Sete in France; Port Mahon and Barcelona in Spain. 

<p>Built in 2001, Adonia has all the facilities you would expect of a modern ship, with a classic and refined interior style. 

<p>Adonia's main restaurant will be the Pacific Restaurant and there will be two further Select dining venues, Italian �Sorrento' and the Ocean Grill by Marco Pierre White. There will also be a buffet restaurant, with some al fresco dining and a barbecue area out on the Lido deck.
For  entertainment, Adonia will have eight bars, including P&O Cruises signature �Crow's Nest' observation lounge; Andersons, the familiar club-style lounge bar; and Raffles, which will also offer a coffee shop menu throughout the day with pastries, chocolates, hot drinks and afternoon tea. There is also a traditional library with fireplace and views on three sides.

<p>Adonia will also feature The Curzon Lounge, where passengers can enjoy a drink with a sea view during the day, and by night enjoy a performance by the Headliners theatre company, concerts, dancing, or after dinner speakers.

<p>There will be the signature Oasis Spa, offering a range of treatments and therapies such as hot stone massages and body scrubs, Aromatherapy, and reflexology. There is also a well equipped gym with panoramic sea views.

<p>Adonia's well appointed cabins will feature Egyptian cotton linen, tea and coffee making facilities so popular with British passengers, and over 75% of the cabins will have a private balcony.

Lauderdale, Florida.  The ship's remarkable 24-day drydock that transformed it from top to bottom also made the vessel a media star with daily video updates that attracted more than a half million views.

<P>The Grand Princess Drydock Journal captured the dramatic process with 26 video updates plus more than 300 photos of the daily progress at the shipyard in the Bahamas,including the unforgettable removal of Skywalkers nightclub from the ship's stern and the complete demolition and rebuilding of the atrium to create the new Piazza.  Hosted by Grand Princess Cruise Director Martyn Moss,the video series delved behind the scenes with reports on all aspects of the drydock process.

<P>The video journal also offered different perspectives on the project with interviews of key players in the revitalization, including the ship's Captain Tony Herriott and Chief Technical Officer Gilberto Vinci, plus Senior Vice President of Technical Services John Gunner and Project Manager Steve Storey, who explained what it takes to coordinate 1'400 contractors working around the clock.  The videos also shared such tidbits as the time it took to cut Skywalkers from the ship (10 hours) and the amount of new carpeting installed (about 50 square miles).

<P>"This drydock has been a monumental effort, and we're very proud of the teamwork by everyone involved to create this sparkling 'new, ship ready to start a season of Europe sailings" said Jan Swartz, Princess Cruises executive vice president. "We know our passengers will appreciate the updated decor, fresh new feel, and especially all the wonderful added features."

<P>Now that the ship has been transformed, passengers will find a completely new Piazza atrium, several new eateries � including Alfredo's Pizzeria and the Crown Grill � and the line's first specialty tea lounge called Leaves.  Also included in the renovation were seven new window suites; remodeled casino, boutiques and art gallery; enhancements to the Horizon Court, Lotus Spa, and wedding chapel; and the addition of Crooner's Martini Lounge.  The new nightclub, The One5, that replaced Skywalkers,will open May 21.

<P>The drydock video journal covered nearly every area involved in the refurbishment project, including work on the underside of the ship, upholstery work, engine control room, new shore power connection, lifeboat updates,new speakers for Movies Under the Stars,mural painting, theater renovations,and a report from the executive chef who was responsible for feeding all the contractors.

Photo Credit: Diane Bondareff/AP Images for Cunard Line" BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>During Queen Mary 2's first Eastbound Crossing of the 2011 Transatlantic Season, Cunard Line welcomed a special reunion on board the 26 April voyage - 15 World War II war brides from Canada and the United States along with their family members. Calling it a "Sentimental Journey" the women retraced their family history by sailing back to England to celebrate the 65th anniversary of when most WWII war brides and their families sailed to North America to be with their servicemen husbands. 

<P>This Queen Mary 2 Crossing holds special significance for these women, as many sailed aboard Cunard ships - Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Aquitania, Mauretania and others - to Halifax (Canada) and New York to be with their husbands during WWII. From 1939 to 1945, Cunard carried more than two million servicemen and their families on board their ships; the fleet was credited by Sir Winston Churchill as helping to shorten the war by a year. 

<P>"It was an absolute pleasure to welcome this group of women and their families aboard Queen Mary 2" said Captain Paul Wright, Master of Queen Mary 2. "Cunard and these women share a unique and proud history of providing service and dedication during war time." 

<P>In addition to Captain Wright, also in attendance to send off the war bride group was Sir Alan Collins,British Consul-General of New York, who said, "I was honoured to meet the war brides and their families aboard one of Britain's finest ships,Queen Mary 2. All of the women have made meaningful contributions to their communities and play an important role in the special relationship that exists between the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada." 

<P>During the voyage, the group attended lectures presented by Bev Tosh, a Canadian war bride daughter and accomplished artist who has focused much of her work on the war bride phenomenon. Eight years ago she painted a large portrait of her mother as a young wife. That painting, which now hangs in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, was the beginning of a passionate pursuit to commemorate all war brides through her artwork. It has evolved into a major touring exhibition called "One-Way Passage" which is the result of hundreds of her personal interviews with war brides in North America, Britain, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>Carnival Cruise Lines,newest ship, the 130,000-ton Carnival Magic, was officially named in a shipboard ceremony in Venice, Italy, earlier today by godmother Lindsey Wilkerson, a former patient at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital who is now serves as an employee and an ambassador of the organization.

<P>Hosted by Senior Cruise Director John Heald, the naming ceremony began with a preview of the line's newest production show, "Destination Unknown."  The spectacular magic revue served to bring Carnival President and CEO Gerry Cahill to the stage as he arrived via helicopter, one of the many illusions that are featured within the new show.

<P>Then, with the assistance of Carnival Magic Captain Giovanni Cutugno, Wilkerson offered the ship and the crew her best wishes and pushed a custom-designed button that rested on a podium resembling the line's iconic winged funnel thus releasing a bottle of champagne across the vessel's bow.

<P>During the ceremony, Carnival presented St. Jude with a $50'000 donation, continuing the line's ongoing partnership of the organization, one of the world's premier centers for the research and treatment of pediatric cancer and other catastrophic diseases.  Through various on-board fundraisers,Carnival endeavors to raise $3 million for St. Jude over a three-year period, as part of the cruise line's Care To Play program.

<P>Following the naming ceremony, Carnival Magic embarked on its inaugural nine-day cruise from Venice to Barcelona, positioning the vessel for a series of seven- to 12-day Mediterranean cruises through October.  The ship will then sail on a 16-day transatlantic then launch year-round seven-day Caribbean cruises from Galveston, Texas,in November.  

<P>As the line's newest ship, Carnival Magic will introduce a host of innovations,including the RedFrog Pub, a colorful Caribbean-inspired watering hole featuring its own private label draught beer; Cucina del Capitano, a family-style Italian restaurant that brings the heritage of Carnival's captains to the table; and SportSquare, an expansive open-air recreation complex with the first ropes course and outdoor fitness area at sea. 

<P>Other features include a WaterWorks aqua park with a 312-foot-long spiral water slide and other attractions; The Lanai, a wraparound promenade with an outdoor barbeque area and whirlpools that extend out over the ship's sides; and Ocean Plaza, a stunning indoor/outdoor caf� and live entertainment venue. 

<P>"With a combination of exciting new features such as the RedFrog Pub, SportSquare and Cucina del Capitano and other popular 'Fun Ship, amenities,Carnival Magic epitomizes our company's continued commitment to providing our guests with fun, memorable vacations at an incredible value" said Gerry Cahill, Carnival Cruise Lines,president and CEO. 

<P>Added Micky Arison, Carnival Corporation & plc's chairman and CEO, "The delivery of a new cruise ship to one of our brands is always a proud and exciting moment" said Micky Arison, chairman and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc.  "It is particularly meaningful that delivery of Carnival Corporation & plc's 100th ship is for the Carnival Cruise Lines brand, which provided the foundation upon which Carnival Corporation & plc was established and, ultimately, grew into the largest cruise operator in the world with 10 global brands."  

<P>Following the May 1 inaugural voyage from Venice, Carnival Magic will sail a series of seven- to 12-day Mediterranean departures from Barcelona through Oct. 16, then reposition to Galveston, Texas,for year-round seven-day Caribbean departures beginning Nov. 14, becoming the largest ship ever based at the port year-round.

</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL Corporation Ltd., "Norwegian" or the "Company") today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2011.

<P>Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2011 improved 37.5% to $81.9 million versus $59.5 million for the same period of 2010. Net Revenue for the quarter increased 20.7% to $368.0 million from $304.9 million in 2010 resulting from a 17.9% increase in Capacity Days,due to the addition of Norwegian Epic to the fleet in June 2010, coupled with an increase in Net Yield of 2.4%. The increase in Net Yield was a result of both improved passenger ticket pricing and increased onboard spend per Capacity Day. Occupancy Percentage for the period was 107.1% compared to 107.9% in the prior period.

<P>Continued pricing discipline and cost control, along with economies of scale attributed to Norwegian Epic, allowed the Company to absorb a 6.6% increase in the per metric ton price of fuel in the period. The Company reported a decrease in Net Cruise Cost per Capacity Day of 1.3% versus prior year. The price of fuel for the first quarter of 2011 increased to $520 per metric ton from $488 in 2010. Excluding fuel expense, Net Cruise Cost per Capacity Day decreased 2.6%.

<p><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_no_epic_sea_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_no_epic_sea.jpg" ALT="Net Revenue for the quarter increased 20.7% to $368.0 million from $304.9 million in 2010 resulting from a 17.9% increase in Capacity Days,due to the addition of Norwegian Epic to the fleet in June 2010." BORDER="0" ALIGN="right"></A>"I am pleased to see that pricing along with the impact of Norwegian Epic drove such a significant improvement in the quarter" said Kevin Sheehan, Norwegian's president and chief executive officer. "On top of the healthy pace our Net Yield grew in the quarter, we also rolled over a very lucrative one-month charter in February 2010 for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Excluding the pricing benefit of this charter, our Net Yield improvement would have been 3.8% for the quarter. In addition, our improved Adjusted EBITDA resulted not only from our increased revenue, but also our continued razor focus on controlling costs without affecting the guest experience." 

<P>Interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased to $47.9 million in the quarter compared to $35.8 million in 2010 due to increased borrowings mainly attributable to the addition of Norwegian Epic. Other income was $2.4 million in 2011 versus expense of $0.6 million in 2010. Net loss for the quarter decreased to $10.6 million on revenue of $495.5 million compared to a net loss of $16.1 million on revenue of $416.5 million in 2010. 

<p>The first phase of enhancements at Great Stirrup Cay, the Company's 250-acre private island in the Bahamas,has been completed. A new marina and dining facility on the island opened in February, representing a significant milestone in the $25 million enhancement project. A new welcome pavilion is scheduled to open this month and construction on a new straw market is commencing. "Great Stirrup Cay was developed to provide our guests an extraordinary island experience and we are thrilled with the exceptionally positive feedback we are receiving on the recent enhancements" commented Sheehan.

<STRONG><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"><I>Royal Caribbean Reports First Quarter Results</I></FONT></STRONG>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. today announced net income for the first quarter 2011 of $91.6 million, or $0.42 per share.  This compares to net income of $87.4 million, or $0.40 per share, in the first quarter of 2010, which included a gain on a legal settlement of $85.6 million, or $0.39 per share.  An $0.11 per share marked-to-market gain on the company's fuel option portfolio is included in first quarter 2011 results.    

<p>Revenues improved to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2011 compared to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of capacity increases and yield improvements.  Net Yields for the first quarter of 2011 increased 4.0% (2.8% on a Constant-Currency basis).  Royal Caribbean said that it saw improvement in both ticket and onboard revenue yields and across all major product groups.

<p>Costs in the first quarter of 2011 were well controlled with most expense categories performing better than expected.  While a less significant factor, some timing shifts to later in 2011 occurred.  NCC were up 0.2%, and NCC excluding fuel increased 0.8%.  Excluding currency impacts,the comparable figures show decreases of 0.1% and increases of 0.6%, respectively.        

<p><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_oasis_arrival2_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_oasis_arrival2.jpg" ALT="Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) this week announced earnings for the first quarter of 2010 and provided guidance for the second quarter and full year 2010." BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>At-the-pump fuel pricing (including the benefit of the company's hedging program) was very similar to earlier calculations at $511 per metric ton.  As previously disclosed, in addition to its fuel hedging activities Royal Caribbean has purchased various fuel options as further protection against rising fuel prices.  Unlike its fuel swaps which largely receive hedge accounting treatment, fuel options are marked-to-market to the income statement at the end of each reporting period.  During the first quarter of 2011 the value of Royal Caribbean's fuel option portfolio increased by $24.2 million, or $0.11 per share, and the associated gain was booked to Other Income/(Expense).   

<p>For the full year, Royal Caribbean said that it  expects Net Yields to improve 5% to 7% on an as-reported basis and 3% to 5% on a Constant-Currency basis.  For the second quarter, Royal Caribbean said that it  expects Net Yields to improve approximately 5% on an as-reported basis and between 1% and 2% on a Constant-Currency basis.

<p>As compared to prior guidance, three significant factors have influenced the company's outlook on yields: geopolitical events,the weakening of the U.S. Dollar and increased tour activities.
Geopolitical:  Bookings at the beginning of the year in the Mediterranean and in Asia were quite strong.  However, events in Northern Africa led to itinerary modifications of 63 sailings and the tragic series of calamities in Japan led to itinerary modifications of 21 sailings. The combination of these events is expected to have a direct negative impact on the company 's yields of approximately 1% for the full year.

<p>Weakening of the U.S. Dollar:  Royal Caribbean said that it's revenues are favorably influenced when the U.S. Dollar weakens versus other currencies.  Assuming current currency exchange rates,the company expects Net Yields for the full year on an as-reported basis to improve between 1% and 2% from its previous guidance as a result of currency.

<p>Increased tour activity:  The company's Spanish brand, Pullmantur, operates a tour company that includes revenue from land tours,air charter and travel distribution.  Recently, Pullmantur has improved its aircraft utilization, and expanded its tour operations and cruise distribution activities in Spain.  This combination is expected to improve Net Yields for the full year by approximately 1%.  

<p>The yield accretion associated with currency exchange rates and increased tour activities will provide more benefit to the company in the third and fourth quarters.  Conversely, the most significant geopolitical yield pressures are expected to occur in the second quarter.  

<p>Royal Caribbean said that it  also noted that it observed a broad slowdown in bookings for Mediterranean sailings following the unrest in Northern Africa.  These booking volumes have now returned to normal levels as a result of reduced pricing.  The effect of this booking disruption has been largely offset by the company's other product groups,including Caribbean and Alaskan itineraries,which continue to show better than expected year-over-year improvement.  

<p>For the full year, Royal Caribbean said that it  expects NCC excluding fuel to increase 4% to 5% on an as-reported basis and 2% - 3% on a Constant-Currency basis.  For the second quarter, Royal Caribbean said that it  expects NCC excluding fuel to increase between 4% - 5% on an as-reported basis and approximately 2% on a Constant-Currency basis. 

<p>Two of the factors influencing the company's yield outlook, currency exchange rates and increased tour activities,are also affecting NCC guidance.  
Weakening of the U.S. Dollar:  While the weakening of the U.S. Dollar has a favorable impact on revenues,it has the opposite impact on costs. Assuming current currency exchange rates,Royal Caribbean said that it  expects 2011 NCC excluding fuel on an as-reported basis to increase approximately 1% for the full year from the previous guidance as a result of currency.

<p>Increased tour activity:  The expansion of tour operations within the company's Pullmantur brand is expected to increase the company's NCC excluding fuel between 1% and 2% for the full year.  The expanded tour activities are not expected to have a material impact on 2011's profitability.

<p>Royal Caribbean said that it  is experiencing some inflationary cost pressures related to food and transportation but this pressure has been offset through savings initiatives in other areas.  

<p>These offsets have been obtained without reducing the strategic marketing, web and consumer engagement investments that the company announced at the beginning of the year.  

<p>Royal Caribbean said that it  does not forecast fuel prices and its cost calculations are based on current at-the-pump prices net of hedging impacts. Based on today's fuel prices the company has included $189 million and $770 million of fuel expense in its second quarter 2011 and full year 2011 guidance, respectively.   

<p>Forecasted consumption is now 56% hedged for the remainder of 2011 at a WTI barrel equivalent rate of approximately $75 bbl, 55% hedged in 2012 at a rate of $86 bbl, 40% hedged in 2013 at a rate of $91 bbl and 10% hedged in 2014 at a rate of $103 bbl.  Additionally, Royal Caribbean said that it  also utilizes fuel options to further protect against escalating fuel prices.  WTI Fuel options at strike prices ranging from $90 bbl to $150 bbl cover an additional 44%, 25%, and 11% of estimated consumption in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>Captain Christopher Rynd has been appointed Commodore of the Cunard Line fleet - Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria - the youngest fleet in the industry and The Most Famous Ocean Liners in the World. Captain Rynd assumes the title held by Commodore Bernard Warner who retired from the company on 19 April 2011. 

<P>"I must put on record our appreciation for the marvellous contribution that Bernie made to Cunard Line. We wish him and his family all the best for his retirement" said Peter Shanks,president of Cunard Line. 

<P>Captain Rynd joined Cunard in 2005 when he took command of Queen Elizabeth 2. While on QE2, he came to appreciate Cunard's distinctive product and traditions. Since then, he has commanded both Queen Mary 2 and Queen Victoria. He took Queen Mary 2 on her Maiden World Voyage and attended the Queen Victoria during her construction and sea trials and later proudly served as her master. 

<P>"I am delighted with the appointment of Captain Rynd as Commodore of Cunard Line and am sure that many of our regular guests will be as pleased as I and will join me in congratulating him on this notable achievement" Shanks said. 

<P>Captain Rynd was born in New Zealand and grew up in Singapore, Sri Lanka, and in the islands of Fiji and Samoa of the tropical South Pacific. He began his sea career in 1970 at the age of 17 in New Zealand. The influence of his father and upbringing helped in this choice. 

<P>After completing his cadetship, Captain Rynd joined his first passenger liner, P&O's Oronsay. His early sea days were in P&O vessels on routes between Australia and the UK, which also included cruising. Since then, most of his career has been in passenger cruise ships on worldwide itineraries. Additionally, he expanded his experience with eight years as a reserve officer in the British Royal Navy. He gained his qualification as Master in London in 1979. During his time with P&O and Princess Cruises,he commanded Royal Princess,Regal Princess,the first and second Pacific Princess,Pacific Sky and Sapphire Princess. 

<P>In 2008, Captain Rynd was elected a Fellow of the Nautical Institute, the international professional body for maritime professionals,and he took time out in 2009 / 2010 to work as a coach under the auspices of the Company's training facility, 'CSmart', in the Netherlands. This was an opportunity to travel in ships across the corporate fleets and be involved in the introduction of new procedures that enhance the safe operations in navigating ships.

BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>In honor of Earth Day, Holland America Line has announced the roll out of its new sustainable seafood program which adopts environmentally responsible purchasing practices and features menus that showcase sustainable seafood.

<P>Working in conjunction with the Marine Conservation Institute � a Washington State partner in promoting sustainable and compatible use of the oceans � Holland America Line's sustainable seafood program emphasizes adopting sustainable seafood purchasing practices. 

<P>"Our sustainability program is an important element in our ongoing commitment to oceans on which we sail and to being responsible corporate citizens in every aspect of our business" said Richard Meadows,CTC, executive vice president, marketing, sales and guest programs at Holland America Line. "We are proud to roll out this program and know our guests will appreciate the fact that their seafood menu selections are responsibly sourced and help promote the continued availability of fish species that are essential to a biologically diverse marine environment."

<P>To determine the sustainability of a particular seafood item, Holland America Line and Marine Conservation Institute referred to well-established seafood ratings/rankings � from Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, Blue Ocean Institute Guide to Ocean Friendly Seafood, World Wildlife Fund Sustainable Seafood Guides,Environmental Defense Fund Seafood Selector and others. Marine Conservation Institute then applied their professional judgment to assess the sustainability of the selection. Each seafood item is evaluated for its abundance, how well the fishery is managed and what damage is done to the surrounding marine ecosystem through catching or farming the seafood. The sustainability program places particular emphasis on maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems. 

<P>"We applaud the efforts of Holland America Line to lead the cruise industry in sustainable seafood practices" said Dr. Elliott Norse, president and founder of Marine Conservation Institute.  "Through leading by example, they convey an important message to their guests,staff, colleagues and particularly to the suppliers that provide seafood to a large company.  What better way than through consumer purchasing behavior to stress to suppliers the need for responsible fishing practices."

<P>Holland America Line will begin the sustainability program with its 2011 Alaska and Europe cruises � and the company plans to extend the program worldwide across the 15-ship fleet over the next year. Menus will be reviewed prior to contracting cycles to ensure that all procured seafood meets the program criteria. New seafood options are evaluated and best-choice alternatives are used whenever possible. The line has provided sustainable seafood specifications to all of its seafood suppliers and modified its procurement process to achieve its goal of all seafood items being responsibly sourced.

<P><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cu_carmen_3d_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cu_carmen_3d.jpg" ALT="Throughout June, the opera "Carmen" - a co-production of RealD and London's Royal Opera House - will be featured, providing viewers the best seat in the house" BORDER="0" ALIGN="right"></A>Throughout June, the opera "Carmen" - a co-production of RealD and London's Royal Opera House - will be featured, providing viewers the best seat in the house, taking them on a magic carpet ride into the heart of this famed opera - immersing them into this exciting story of love, jealousy and betrayal. CARMEN IN 3D is a dazzling film, filled with some of the best-loved music ever written and performed by a world-class cast.

<P>In addition, upcoming summer 3D blockbusters will be shown, including Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. 

<P>Also new this year, professional songwriter and producer Chris Difford, formerly of the 1970's British new wave band Squeeze, will conduct songwriting workshops with four other professional songwriters as part of the Professional Insights series. With Difford's songwriting programme, guests will collaborate in small groups with guitarists,pianists,singers and bass players from Queen Mary 2's performance company. The best songwriters will then have the opportunity to record their songs in a studio on board and be able to take them home.

"Once again, the worlds of theatre, music and literature truly come alive on board, providing guests the combination of accessible world-class entertainment with the opportunity to tap into their own creative sides." 

<P>Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) - The RADA graduate company continues to celebrate its longstanding relationship with Cunard with daily workshops and classic performances. This year, RADA will go beyond Queen Mary 2's Royal Court Theatre to feature several new interactive offerings including dramatic re-enactments throughout the ship. These "street theatre" performances will be taken from such classic works as Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales and Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing: 

<p>� The Pilgrim's Journey: The actors will travel in costume around the ship in characters from The Canterbury Tales as they would travel to Canterbury; they will stop several times for a short scene/improvisation 

<p>� Much Ado Around the Ship: Two groups of actors will perform short scenes from the play around the ship 

<p>� A Bedtime Story: Taking place in the Grand Lobby, one of the RADA actors will sit in an armchair and read a bedtime story, surrounded by a small group of guests; requests can be taken for night six of the voyage 

<p>� The Canterbury Tales Performance, Royal Court Theatre: RADA will perform a different Canterbury Tale each month, performing the complete works over the course of two years; at the end of each performance, the audience will be encouraged to choose their favourite tale; the actors will then ask for short stories to be called The Cunard Tales to be written by members of the audience; these will then be workshopped and performed by the actors and participants 

<p>Also new for 2011, RADA appears in two of Queen Mary 2's lounges,blending musical components with performances featuring poetry, piano and jazz including: 

<p>� Jazz Poetry with the Mark Hodgson Trio, Chart Room: The actors will perform rhythmic, jazz and rap poetry accompanied by the trio 

<p>� Passion and Piano, Winter Garden: The actors will read passionate poetry and prose accompanied by the piano, and will also read chosen pieces and take requests from the audience.

</TABLE>
From the Great Wall to the river markets of Vietnam, Asian culture has long intrigued vacationers who seek exotic lands and exquisite cultural experiences. Premium cruise brand Celebrity Cruises will give vacationers a way to enjoy Asia in style when it introduces its first-ever season in the region, during the winter of 2012-13, on Celebrity Millennium, which Celebrity plans to "Solsticize" in April 2012. 

<p><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cb_millennium_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cb_millennium.jpg" ALT="Celebrity Cruises will give vacationers a way to enjoy Asia in style when it introduces its first-ever season in the region, during the winter of 2012-13, on Celebrity Millennium, which Celebrity plans to "Solsticize" in April 2012. " BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>"Visiting the Far East for the first time is the result of constantly listening to consumers,who have told us they're eager to vacation in the region with Celebrity" said Dan Hanrahan, President and CEO, Celebrity Cruises. "We know that vacationers,time is precious,and by delivering a destination as culturally rich and compelling as Asia, with a luxurious shipboard environment that offers truly extraordinary accommodations,service, cuisine and activities,we are offering them the opportunity to experience a deeply rewarding, memorable holiday." 

<p>Celebrity Cruises coined the word "Solsticize" last year, referring to the addition of some of the most popular venues on the line's widely heralded Solstice Class ships,to its Millennium Class ships. In keeping with those plans,when Celebrity Millennium becomes the first Celebrity Cruises ship to sail an Asia season, she will do so with a new slate of AquaClass staterooms. In a drydock scheduled for April 2012, 70 of the ship's existing Concierge Class staterooms will be converted to Celebrity's signature, industry-first, spa-inspired AquaClass staterooms,and an additional 37 will be built. Guests who book sumptuous "Celebrity Suites" in which to enjoy Celebrity's Asia cruises will also enjoy more time outdoors on a new veranda, as Celebrity plans to add these to Celebrity Millennium's eight existing suites in this category. Celebrity also plans to add six inside staterooms and 17 oceanview staterooms,increasing the total number of available staterooms to 1'079. 

<p>During the 2012/13 winter season, Celebrity Millennium will visit nine countries new to the brand, including Vietnam, Thailand and China, among others. Celebrity's inaugural Asia season will consist of a series of 14-night open-jaw cruises between Singapore and Hong Kong. Overnight stays in ports like Singapore; Bangkok, Thailand; Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Halong Bay, Vietnam and Hong Kong, China offer more opportunities for travelers to immerse themselves in Asian culture. The season also will include two 14-night sailings roundtrip from Singapore with overnight stays in Bali, Indonesia, in January 2013. 

<p>Bookending Celebrity Millennium's core Asia season will be two transpacific voyages offering unique experiences. The westbound cruise will coincide with the total solar eclipse in November 2012. Guests will be able to view the eclipse while at sea, when sailing from Fiji to New Zealand. In April 2013, Celebrity Millennium will reposition from Hong Kong to Shanghai on a cruise featuring overnight calls in Hong Kong and Beijing (Tianjin), China. The ship will then continue eastbound across the North Pacific to Alaska and will call at various ports in China, Japan, and Russia. 

<p>Guests who wish to deepen their experience in Asia can take advantage of one of Celebrity's cruisetours,which combine a cruise with a five-night pre- or post-cruise escorted land package out of Hong Kong.  The cruisetours will feature trips to Xian and Beijing to view the famed Terra Cotta Warriors and the Great Wall of China.  All of these packages are escorted by a local tour director and include hotel accommodations,transportation, select activities,breakfasts and some additional meals. 

<p>While sailing, a variety of shore excursions are available to travelers who wish to immerse themselves in the region. A number of overnight stays in port during the Asia cruises will offer guests the opportunity to enjoy two- or three-day excursions. Examples of these include a two-night/three-day overland experience from Bangkok to Siem Reap to visit Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The tour focuses on the temples of Angkor to see the best examples of stone carvings recovered from temples across Cambodia. During cruises that include an overnight stay in port at Halong Bay (Hanoi), Vietnam, an overnight shore excursion includes a visit to the Old Quarter of Hanoi; an opportunity to witness unique Vietnamese performing arts at the Hanoi Water Puppet Theatre; enjoy dinner at a traditional Vietnamese restaurant; and an overnight stay in a leading hotel in Hanoi. Guests also will experience the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology, the Ho Chi Minh Quarter, One Pillar Pagoda, the Temple of Literature, Hoa Lo Museum, as well as a gentle ride on a traditional street cyclo, and lunch at Vietnamese restaurant. 

<p>Celebrity also recently announced additional expansion in the Eastern Hemisphere - the award-winning, 2'850-guest Celebrity Solstice, will be the newest Celebrity ship to sail a full winter season in Australia/New Zealand in 2012-13.

Lindsey's selection as godmother is a tribute to the special children of St. Jude, as well as an acknowledgement of the groundbreaking efforts the organization has made in the fight against childhood cancer" said Gerry Cahill, Carnival president and CEO.

<p>Last year, Carnival launched its new Care to Play: Carnival For St. Jude Kids program, which encompasses shipboard fundraisers fleetwide that provide guests an opportunity to participate in fun, interactive activities designed to raise funds and awareness in the fight against childhood cancer.  Carnival's goal is to raise $3 million over a three-year period.  The line will also make a $50'000 donation in Wilkerson's honor during the naming ceremony.

<p>"Carnival has been very creative in developing entertaining fundraising opportunities for guests through its Care to Play program" said Richard C. Shadyac Jr., CEO of ALSAC, the fundraising organization of St. Jude. "We were so excited to hear that they selected as godmother of the ship one of our former patients,Lindsey, whose story touched not only our friends at Carnival, but so many others who have had the pleasure of meeting her. She is a true inspiration to us all."

BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"></A>Wilkerson was diagnosed with cancer at age 10 and began treatment as a patient at the St. Jude facility in Memphis,Tenn. After nearly three years of treatment, doctors determined her cancer was in remission and she went on to finish high school and attend college.  She joined ALSAC, the fundraising organization of St. Jude, in 2004 and is now a volunteer specialist helping to engage and support St. Jude volunteers across the country. Wilkerson also volunteers as a tour guide at the hospital and is a member of the organization's Family Advisory Council and the St. Jude Women's Club, the latter for which she serves as president.

<p>"On behalf of all of the children of St. Jude, I'm so honored to serve as godmother to the beautiful Carnival Magic and celebrate this exciting opportunity" said Wilkerson. "I am alive today because of the world class research and treatment at St. Jude. The generous support of Carnival and their guests will help St. Jude continue to provide hope to children stricken with catastrophic illnesses."

<p>Following the naming ceremony, Lindsey and her family will be among the nearly 3'700 guests who will sail on the Carnival Magic as she departs on an inaugural nine-day Mediterranean voyage that ends in Barcelona May 10.  

<p>The ship will operate a series of seven- to 12-day Mediterranean cruises through October then reposition to Galveston, Texas,for seven-day Caribbean cruises beginning in November, becoming the largest cruise ship ever based year-round at that port.

<p><i><b>Last Week's Question</b> - Passengers in the top cabins aboard QE2 today eat in the Queens Grill Restaurant.  It wasn't always that way.  What was the space now occupied by the Queen's Grill called when QE2 first entered service?  Bonus question:  What year did this space become the Queen's Grill? </b>
</i>

<p>
<i>
<b>Answer</b> -  
The space on QE2 now occupied by the Queen's Grill was originally known as Club 736.  736 was the hull number assigned to the ship while under construction by her builders: John Brown & Co. The conversion of the former Club 736 to the Queen's Grill took place in 1972 at the same time as the original penthouse suites were added.

BORDER="0" ALIGN="right"></A>Ambassadors International, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMIE) ("Ambassadors") announced this week that it has entered into an agreement with Whippoorwill Associates,Inc., as agent for its discretionary funds and accounts ("Whippoorwill") to sell Windstar Cruises.  Under the terms of the agreement, Ambassadors proposes to sell substantially all of its assets,including its principal operating unit, Windstar Cruises ("Windstar"), through a court-supervised sale process.  In accordance with the terms of the agreement with Whippoorwill, and to facilitate the sale transaction, Ambassadors and its U.S. subsidiaries today voluntarily filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

<p>Ambassadors and Windstar intend to continue normal business operations during the sale process,which is proposed to be completed in approximately 45 days.  Windstar also plans,subject to court approval, to continue to:
<br>� Operate all Windstar cruises as scheduled;
<br>� Maintain all of Windstar's customer programs and policies;
<br>� Honor all Windstar fares and reservations,including charter contracts;
<br>� Provide commissions and payments to its travel partners as usual and employee wages and benefits without interruption; and 
<br>� Pay all Windstar vendors and suppliers for goods and services received both before and during the reorganization process in connection with the sale. 


<P>Whippoorwill, a private investment firm with over $1 billion under management, intends to maintain Windstar's business and operations and invest in Windstar's growth following completion of the anticipated sale.  

<P>Shelley F. Greenhaus,President of Whippoorwill, said "Windstar is a leading brand in the small ship luxury travel market.  Windstar's unique vessels and itineraries offer a one of a kind cruise experience.  In its short tenure, the existing management team has made significant strides in transforming Windstar's operations.  The various initiatives implemented in the past year have started to turn the business around.  Once it is free of its debt burden, we are confident Windstar will be poised to grow its market share over the long term."  

<P>Whippoorwill has agreed to provide $10 million in new financing under a Debtor-in-Possession (DIP) credit facility, which can be used to help support Ambassadors,and Windstar's continuing operations during the sale process.  With its current cash availability and this additional funding, Ambassadors believes that it has ample liquidity to meet its obligations to Windstar's customers,suppliers and employees without interruption while the sale is being completed.  Upon emergence from this process,Windstar will be financially stronger with substantially less debt and greater financial resources to support its future growth.  

<P>Hans Birkholz, CEO of Ambassadors and Windstar, said, "We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Whippoorwill, and are confident Windstar will have a bright future ahead.  Whippoorwill has been a strong supporter of the business for the past two years and we look forward to continuing this partnership." 

<P>"Windstar has earned its reputation as a world-class brand by providing affordable luxury vacations with attentive service staff and outstanding amenities on each of our vessels -- and we intend to continue delivering on that commitment.  Our customers and guests remain our top priority.  The actions we are announcing today will allow us to build on our strong brand position and guest experience delivery while we position Windstar for profitability and long-term success.  Going forward, Windstar will continue providing the extraordinary experiences and exceptional service that are its hallmarks" Birkholz concluded.

</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The UK cruise market grew again in 2010 and, in the Carnival UK Cruise Report 2011 published today (March 29); Chief Executive Officer David Dingle insists that there should be no fears about over-capacity. 

<P>In fact, talk of market saturation is "frankly absurd", he says,pointing out that Carnival UK brands met their sales growth and pricing targets in 2010 and are optimistic of doing the same this year. 

<P>This optimism is supported by the latest YouGov "Attitudes to Cruising" study* which showed that, amongst those cruising in the last 5 years,consumer awareness of one of those brands - Cunard Line - rose 15% over the past year, whilst there was also a 50% increase in the number of cruisers most likely to choose the brand. 

<P><A HREF="javascript:Start('http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cu_qv_big.jpg')";><IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cu_qv.jpg" ALT="Paying tribute to the "In fact, for recent (last 5 years) cruisers,Cunard's three ships (Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth) are now the most recognised ships in the UK market." BORDER="0" ALIGN="right"></A>In fact, for recent (last 5 years) cruisers,Cunard's three ships (Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth) are now the most recognised ships in the UK market. The same study confirmed another Carnival UK brand, P&O Cruises,as the "most recalled" cruise brand in the UK and the study's sample of P&O Cruises passengers rated it "significantly higher" than its key competitors for high quality food and service, value for money and as a company to trust. 

<P>While confident of continued sustainable growth in the UK cruise market, CEO Dingle also believes that new environmentally-based regulations will require all cruise lines to make changes in the way they operate. 

<P>To meet its own environmental targets,Carnival UK has already reduced fuel consumption by 5% in each of the last two years but higher fuel costs from 2015 created by air emissions regulations will ensure � he says � that the sector will have to modify itineraries to reduce cruise speeds,distances travelled and sometimes the number of ports visited, too. 

<P>As well as the environmental benefits this will produce, any such changes would be in line with evolving cruise passenger tastes. 

<P>As Dingle reports,the new larger ships being operated by brands such as P&O Cruises and Cunard Line are already considered destinations in their own right by passengers who enjoy days at sea as a time to take advantage of the much greater range of activities these multi-facility ships now offer. This trend is evidenced by an increase in demand for shorter cruises out of UK ports. 

<P>Dingle also points out that "people taking overseas cruises on UK-based ships produce significantly more benefits for the UK economy than overseas package holidays." 

<P>The Report also includes: 

<P>� Updates on P&O Cruises,Cunard Line, Princess Cruises,Seabourn, Carnival Cruise Lines,Costa Cruises and Holland America Line 

<P>� Insight on on-board wining and dining trends 

<P>� How cruise brands are now communicating through the social media 

<P>� A futuristic feature where top Carnival UK executives reveal their personal wish-list for the next generation of cruise ships - if money and space were no object. These include:<br><p>� Plasma-walled cabins for the iPad generation <br><p>� Wimbledon-style tennis courts <br><p>� Satellite-linked schoolrooms and offices at sea <br><p>� An underwater restaurant.

European success led to Hyytia's 1998 debut within the Latin-American community by singing in eight episodes of the popular Telemundo television show, "Sue�os De Fama."

<P>"The entertainers appearing on Norwegian Epic for the European summer itineraries performing as Elton John, Whitney Houston and Shakira were specifically selected because of their international appeal and diverse musical styles" said Brian Brigner, chief operating officer for "Legends" producer, On Stage Entertainment. "They are three of the highest quality tribute acts in the world, and they will be joined by the always electrifying Legends singers and dancers,and a rockin, live band."

<STRONG><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2"><I>Carnival Reports Full Details of First Quarter Earnings</I></FONT></STRONG>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<IMG SRC="http://www.cruiseserver.net/images/news/news_cc_Logo.jpg" ALT="Carnival Announces First Quarter Earning " BORDER="0" ALIGN="left">Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK) reported net income of $152 million, or $0.19 diluted EPs,on revenues of $3.4 billion for its first quarter ended February 28, 2011. Net income for the first quarter 2010 was $175 million, or $0.22 diluted EPs,on revenues of $3.2 billion.  The first quarter 2010 included the favorable impact of $0.10 per share from unusual items.  

<P>Carnival Corporation & plc Chairman and CEO Micky Arison indicated that earnings in the first quarter 2011 were at the high end of the company's December guidance due to lower than expected unit costs which offset higher than expected fuel prices.    

<P>Commenting on the first quarter, Arison said, "Net revenue yields increased 2 percent (constant dollars) driven by a significant improvement in ticket prices for our European brands. We remained focused on managing costs and reducing fuel consumption. All of which more than offset rising fuel prices during the quarter." 

<P>During the first quarter, Carnival announced an increase in its regular quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share from $0.10 per share, signifying continuing confidence in the company's future earnings potential.  

<P><strong>2011 Outlook   </strong>

<p>Since the start of the calendar year, booking volumes and prices for the remaining three quarters are running higher than the prior year. At this point in time, cumulative advance bookings for the remainder of the year are at higher prices with slightly lower occupancies versus last year.  

<P>Arison noted, "Despite the uncertain world events that have unfolded during our peak booking period, we have experienced a solid wave season.  Ticket prices for the peak summer season remain particularly strong. The convenience and affordability of a cruise vacation continues to gain recognition as consumers discover the unrivaled experience cruising offers. As a result, long-term fundamentals for our business remain attractive in an environment where consumers increasingly value the importance of taking their holidays."  

<P>Carnival said that it expects full year net revenue yields,on a constant dollar basis,to increase 2.5 to 3.5 percent compared to 3 to 4 percent in its December guidance. As previously announced, the change in yield guidance of approximately $44 million, or $0.05 per share, results from the itinerary changes in the Middle East and North Africa necessitated by the political unrest in that region. Carnival said that it expects net revenue yields on a current dollar basis to increase 4.5 to 5.5 percent for the full year 2011 compared to 2010. 

<P>Carnival said that it  expects net cruise costs,excluding fuel, per ALBD for the full year 2011 to be flat to up slightly on a constant dollar basis compared to flat in its December guidance due to increasing inflation expectations. Slightly lower expectations in other cost categories are expected to offset the slightly higher net cruise costs guidance. 

<P>As previously announced, fuel prices have increased significantly since we provided December guidance. Based on current spot prices for fuel, fuel costs are now expected to increase $355 million for the full year 2011 compared to December guidance, costing an additional $0.45 per share.  However, the weakening of the U.S. dollar since December guidance is expected to benefit earnings by $75 million, or $0.09 per share. 

<P>Taking all the above factors into consideration, Carnival said that it  now forecasts full year 2011 fully diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, compared to its December guidance range of $2.90 to $3.10 and full year 2010 of $2.47. This guidance is slightly better than the update provided on March 11, due to the change in spot prices for fuel and currency.

<P><strong>Second Quarter 2011 </strong>  

<P>Second quarter constant dollar net revenue yields are expected to increase in the 1.5 to 2.5 percent range (4.5 to 5.5 percent on a current dollar basis) compared to the prior year. Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD for the second quarter are expected to be 2.0 to 3.0 percent higher on a constant dollar basis. Fuel costs for the second quarter are expected to increase $140 million compared to the prior year, costing an additional $0.18 per share.

<P>Based on current fuel prices and currency exchange rates,Carnival said that it  expects fully diluted earnings for the second quarter 2011 to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24 per share, down from $0.32 per share in 2010 due to the drag on earnings from the higher fuel prices. 

<P>During the second quarter two new ships will debut in Europe, AIDA Cruises,2'194-passenger AIDAsol and Carnival Cruise Lines,3'690-passenger Carnival Magic, furthering the company's strategy to expand its global presence.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT CLASS="text_specials">What a charming little chain of islands. Walk on pink sand beaches. Swim and snorkel in turquoise seas. Take in the historical sights. They're stoically British and very quaint. Or explore the coral reefs. You can get to them by boat or propelled by fins. You pick. Freestyle Cruising doesn't tell you where to go or what to do. Sure, you can plan ahead, or decide once onboard. After all, it's your vacation. There are no deadlines or must do's.

<TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT CLASS="text_specials">For centuries people have traveled to Europe to see magnificent ruins, art treasures and natural wonders. And the best way to do so is by cruise ship. Think of it - you pack and unpack only once. No wasted time searching for hotels and negotiating train stations. Instead, you arrive at romantic ports of call relaxed, refreshed and ready to take on the world.
