        <h3>Vitamin C</h3>
<br />
<p>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble <a href="../../glossary.html#vitamin">vitamin</a>. 
        Unlike most mammals and other animals, humans do not have the ability to make their own 
        vitamin C. Therefore, we must obtain vitamin C through our diet.</p>
      <p align="center"><a name="function"></a><strong>Function</strong></p>
      <p>Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of collagen, an important structural 
        component of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and bone. Vitamin C also 
        plays an important role in the synthesis of the <a href="../../glossary.html#neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>, 
        norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters are critical to brain function and are 
        known to affect mood. In addition, vitamin C is required for the synthesis 
        of <a href="../../othernuts/carnitine/index.html">carnitine</a>, a small 
        molecule that is essential for the transport of fat into cellular organelles 
        called <a href="../../glossary.html#mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, where the fat is converted to energy <a href="crefs.html#reference">(1)</a>. Research also suggests that vitamin C is involved in the metabolism of 
        cholesterol to <a href="../../glossary.html#bile acids">bile acids</a>, 
        which may have implications for blood cholesterol levels and the incidence 
        of gallstones <a href="crefs.html#ref2">(2)</a>.</p>
      <p>Vitamin C is also a highly effective <a href="../../glossary.html#antioxidant">antioxidant</a>. 
        Even in small amounts vitamin C can protect indispensable molecules in 
        the body, such as proteins, lipids (fats), carbohydrates, and <a href="../../glossary.html#nucleic acids"> 
        nucleic acids</a> (DNA and RNA), from damage by <a href="../../glossary.html#free radical">free 
        radicals</a> and <a href="../../glossary.html#reactive oxygen species">reactive 
        oxygen species</a> that can be generated during normal metabolism as well 
        as through exposure to toxins and pollutants (e.g., cigarette smoke). Vitamin C 
        may also be able to regenerate other antioxidants such as vitamin E <a href="crefs.html#reference">(1)</a>. One recent study of cigarette smokers found that vitamin C regenerated vitamin E from its oxidized form <a href="crefs.html#ref3">(3)</a>.</p>
      <p align="center"><a name="deficiency"></a><strong>Deficiency</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Scurvy</strong></p>
      <p>Severe vitamin C deficiency has been known for many centuries as the 
        potentially fatal disease, <a href="../../glossary.html#scurvy">scurvy</a>. 
        By the late 1700s the British navy was aware that scurvy could be cured 
        by eating oranges or lemons, even though vitamin C would not be isolated 
        until the early 1930s. Symptoms of scurvy include bleeding and bruising 
        easily, hair and tooth loss, and joint pain and swelling. Such symptoms appear 
        to be related to the weakening of blood vessels, connective tissue, and 
        bone, which all contain collagen. Early symptoms of scurvy like fatigue 
        may result from diminished levels of <a href="../../glossary.html#carnitine">carnitine</a>, which is
        needed to derive energy from fat, or from decreased synthesis of the <a href="../../glossary.html#neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> 
        norepinephrine (see <a href="#function">Function</a>). Scurvy is rare 
        in developed countries because it can be prevented by as little as 10 
        mg of vitamin C daily <a href="crefs.html#ref4">(4)</a>. However, 
        cases have occurred in children and the elderly on very restricted 
        diets <a href="crefs.html#ref5"> (5, 6)</a>.</p>
      <p><a name="rda"></a><strong>The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)</strong></p>
      <p>In the U.S., the recommended dietary allowance (<a href="../../glossary.html#rda">RDA</a>) 
        for vitamin C was revised in 2000 upward from the previous recommendation of 60 mg daily for men and 
        women. The RDA continues to be based primarily on the prevention of deficiency 
        disease, rather than the prevention of <a href="../../glossary.html#chronic disease">chronic 
        disease</a> and the promotion of optimum health. The recommended intake 
        for smokers is 35 mg/day higher than for nonsmokers, because smokers are 
        under increased <a href="../../glossary.html#oxidative stress">oxidative 
        stress</a> from the toxins in cigarette smoke and generally have lower 
        blood levels of vitamin C <a href="crefs.html#ref7">(7)</a>.</p>

      <p align="center"><a name="disease_prevention"></a><strong>Disease Prevention</strong></p>
      <p>The amount of vitamin C required to prevent <a href="../../glossary.html#chronic disease">chronic 
        disease</a> appears to be more than that required for prevention of scurvy. 
        Much of the information regarding vitamin C and the prevention of chronic 
        disease is based on <a href="../../glossary.html#prospective study">prospective 
        studies</a>, in which vitamin C intake is assessed in large numbers of 
        people who are followed over time to determine whether they develop specific 
        chronic diseases.</p>
      <p><a name="cvd"></a><strong>Cardiovascular Diseases</strong></p>
      <p><strong><i>Coronary Heart Disease</i></strong></p>
      <p>Until recently, the results of most <a href="../../glossary.html#prospective study">prospective 
        studies</a> indicated that low or deficient intakes of vitamin C were 
        associated with an increased risk of <a href="../../glossary.html#cardiovascular diseases">cardiovascular 
        diseases</a>, and that modest dietary intakes of about 100 mg/day were 
        sufficient for maximal reduction of cardiovascular disease risk among 
        nonsmoking men and women <a href="crefs.html#reference">(1)</a>. A recent <a href="../../glossary.html#meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of 14 cohort studies concluded that dietary vitamin C intake, but not supplemental vitamin C intake, was inversely related to <a href="../../glossary.html#coronary heart disease">coronary heart disease</a> (CHD) risk <a href="crefs.html#ref8">(8)</a>. Thus, some studies did not find significant reductions in CHD risk among vitamin C supplement users in well-nourished 
        populations <a href="crefs.html#ref9">(9-11)</a>. One notable exception 
        was the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 
        I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study <a href="crefs.html#ref12">(12)</a>. This 
        study found that the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases was 42% 
        lower in men and 25% lower in women who consumed more than 50 mg/day of 
        dietary vitamin C <i>and</i> regularly took vitamin C supplements, corresponding 
        to a total vitamin C intake of about 300 mg/day <a href="crefs.html#ref13">(13)</a>. 
        Results from the Nurses� Health Study (NHS), based on the follow-up of more 
        than 85,000 women over 16 years, also suggested that higher vitamin C intakes 
        may be cardioprotective <a href="crefs.html#ref14">(14)</a>. In this study, 
        vitamin C intake of more than 359 mg/day from diet plus supplements or 
        supplement use itself was associated with a 27-28% reduction in CHD risk. 
        However, in those women who did not take vitamin C supplements, dietary 
        vitamin C intake was not significantly associated with CHD risk. Hence, both the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study <a href="crefs.html#ref12">(12, 13)</a> and NHS <a href="crefs.html#ref14">(14)</a> do not support the conclusions of the above meta-analysis <a href="crefs.html#ref8">(8)</a>. Another pooled analysis of nine <a href="../../glossary.html#prospective study">prospective 
        cohort studies</a>, including more than 290,000 adults who were free of 
        CHD at baseline and followed for an average of ten years, found that those

        Therefore, the results of the pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies as well as individual, large prospective studies, such as the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study <a href="crefs.html#ref12">(12, 13)</a> and NHS <a href="crefs.html#ref14">(14)</a>, together with pharmacokinetic data of vitamin C in humans <a href="crefs.html#ref18">(18)</a>, suggest

        in those who consumed vegetables 6-7 days of the week was 54% lower than 
        in those who consumed vegetables 0-2 days of the week. In this population, 
        serum levels of vitamin C were highly correlated with fruit and vegetable 
        intake. Therefore, as in many studies of vitamin C intake and chronic 
        disease risk, it is difficult to separate the effects of vitamin C on 
        stroke risk from the effects of other components of fruits and vegetables, 
        emphasizing the benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables in reducing stroke risk. Hence, plasma vitamin C levels may be a good <a href="../../glossary.html#biomarker">biomarker</a> for fruit and vegetable intake and other lifestyle factors that contribute to a reduced risk of stroke. A recent 10-year prospective study in 20,649 adults found that those in the top <a href="../../glossary.html#quartile">quartile</a> of plasma vitamin C concentrations had a 42% lower risk of stroke compared to those in the lowest quartile <a href="crefs.html#ref21">(21)</a>.

      <p><a name="cancer"></a><strong>Cancer</strong></p>
      <p>A large number of studies have shown that increased consumption of fresh 
        fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for most types 
        of <a href="../../glossary.html#cancer">cancer</a> <a href="crefs.html#ref22">(22)</a>. 
        Such studies were the basis for dietary guidelines endorsed by the U.S. 
        Department of Agriculture and the National Cancer Institute, which recommended 
        at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. U.S. government organizations currently recommend eating a variety of fruits and vegetables daily; the recommended serving number depends on total caloric intake, which is governed by age, gender, body composition, and physical activity level <a href="crefs.html#ref23">(23)</a>. A number of <a href="../../glossary.html#case-control study">case-control 
        studies</a> have investigated the role of vitamin C in cancer prevention.&nbsp; 
        Most have shown that higher intakes of vitamin C are associated with decreased

        stomach, <a href="../../glossary.html#colon">colon</a>-rectum, and lung. 
        Because the possibility of bias is greater in case-control 
        studies, <a href="../../glossary.html#prospective study">prospective cohort
        studies</a> are generally given more weight when evaluating the effect 
        of nutrient intake on disease. In general, prospective studies in 
        which the lowest intake group consumed more than 86 mg of vitamin C daily 
        have not found differences in cancer risk, while studies finding significant 
        cancer risk reductions found them in people consuming at least 80 to 110 
        mg of vitamin C daily <a href="crefs.html#reference">(1)</a>.</p>
      <p>A prospective study that followed 870 men over a period of 25 years found that those 
        who consumed more than 83 mg of vitamin C daily had a striking, 64% reduction 
        in lung cancer compared with those who consumed less than 63 mg per day 
        <a href="crefs.html#ref24">(24)</a>. However, a pooled analysis of eight prospective studies concluded that dietary vitamin C was not related to lung cancer when the analysis was controlled for other dietary factors <a href="crefs.html#ref25">(25)</a>. Although most large prospective studies 
        observed no association between breast cancer and vitamin C intake, two  
        studies found dietary vitamin C intake to be inversely associated with 
        breast cancer risk in certain subgroups. In the Nurses' Health Study, 
        premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer who consumed 
        an average of 205 mg/day of vitamin C from foods had a 63% lower risk 
        of breast cancer than those who consumed an average of 70 mg/day <a href="crefs.html#ref26">(26)</a>. 
        In the Swedish Mammography Cohort, overweight women who consumed 
        an average of 110 mg/day of vitamin C had a 39% lower risk of breast cancer 
        compared to overweight women who consumed an average of 31 mg/day <a href="crefs.html#ref27">(27)</a>. A number of observational studies have found increased dietary vitamin 
        C intake to be associated with decreased risk of stomach cancer, and laboratory 
        experiments indicate that vitamin C inhibits the formation of carcinogenic 
        compounds in the stomach <a href="crefs.html#ref28">(28, 29)</a>. Infection with the bacteria, <i>Helicobacter 
        pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>), is known to increase the risk of stomach 
        cancer and also appears to lower the vitamin C content of stomach secretions. 
        Although two intervention studies did not find a decrease in the occurrence 
        of stomach cancer with vitamin C supplementation <a href="crefs.html#ref7">(7)</a>, 
        more recent research suggests that vitamin C supplementation may be a 
        useful addition to standard <i>H. pylori</i> eradication therapy in reducing 
        the risk of gastric cancer <a href="crefs.html#ref30">(30, 31)</a>. Another intervention trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in more than 14,000 older men participating in the Physicians� Health Study (PHS) II, reported vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for an average of eight years had no significant effect on total cancer or site-specific cancers, including colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer <a href="crefs.html#ref32">(32)</a>. However, the PHS II had several limitations; see the <a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/news/response2.html">Linus Pauling Institute�s response</a> to the PHS II.</p>
      <p><a name="cataracts"></a><strong>Cataracts</strong></p>
      <p>Cataracts are a leading cause of visual impairment throughout the world. 
        In the U.S., cataract-related expenditures are estimated to exceed &#36;3 billion annually <a href="crefs.html#ref33">(33)</a>. Cataracts occur 
        more frequently and become more severe as people age. Decreased vitamin 
        C levels in the lens of the eye have been associated with increased severity 
        of cataracts in humans. Some, but not all, studies have observed increased 
        dietary vitamin C intake <a href="crefs.html#ref34"> (34, 35)</a> and increased 
        blood levels of vitamin C <a href="crefs.html#ref36"> (36, 37)</a> to be associated 
        with decreased risk of cataracts. In general, those studies that have found a relationship 
        suggest that vitamin C intake may have to be higher than 300 mg/day for 
        a number of years before a protective effect can be detected <a href="crefs.html#reference">(1)</a>. 
        A 7-year controlled intervention trial in 4,629 men and women found that a daily antioxidant supplement containing 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, and 15 
        mg of beta-carotene had no effect on the development and progression 
        of age-related cataracts compared to a <a href="../../glossary.html#placebo">placebo</a> <a href="crefs.html#ref38">(38)</a>. Therefore, 
        the relationship between vitamin C intake and the development of cataracts 
        requires further clarification before specific recommendations can be 
        made.</p>
		  <p><a name="gout"></a><strong>Gout</strong></p>
		  <p><a href="../../glossary.html#gout">Gout</a>, a condition that afflicts more than 1% of U.S. adults, is characterized by abnormally high blood levels of uric acid (urate) <a href="crefs.html#ref39">(39)</a>. Urate crystals may form in joints, resulting in inflammation and pain, as well as in the kidneys and urinary tract, resulting in kidney stones. The tendency to develop elevated blood uric acid levels and gout is often inherited; however, dietary and lifestyle modification may be helpful in both the prevention and treatment of gout <a href="crefs.html#ref40">(40)</a>. In an <a href="../../glossary.html#observational study">observational study</a> that included 1,387 men, higher intakes of vitamin C were associated with lower <a href="../../glossary.html#serum">serum</a> levels of uric acid <a href="crefs.html#ref41">(41)</a>. More recently, a <a href="../../glossary.html#prospective study">prospective study</a> that followed a cohort of 46,994 men for 20 years found that total daily vitamin C intake was inversely associated with risk of gout, with higher intakes being associated with greater risk reductions <a href="crefs.html#ref42">(42)</a>. The results of this study also indicate that supplemental vitamin C may be helpful in the prevention of gout <a href="crefs.html#ref42">(42)</a>. Interestingly, a <a href="../../glossary.html#randomized design">randomized</a>, <a href="../../glossary.html#double blind">double-blind</a>, <a href="../../glossary.html#placebo">placebo</a>-controlled trial in 184 adult nonsmokers reported that vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for two months lowered serum concentrations of uric acid compared to placebo <a href="crefs.html#ref43">(43)</a>.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="lead"></a>Lead toxicity</strong></p>
      <p>Although the use of lead paint and leaded gasoline has been discontinued 
        in the U.S., lead toxicity continues to be a significant health problem, 
        especially in children living in urban areas. Abnormal growth and development 
        have been observed in infants of women exposed to lead during pregnancy, 
        while children who are chronically exposed to lead are more likely to 
        develop learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and to have a low IQ. 
        In adults, lead toxicity may result in kidney damage, high blood pressure, and <a href="../../glossary.html#anemia">anemia</a>. 
        In a study of 747 older men, blood lead levels were significantly higher 
        in those who reported total dietary vitamin C intakes averaging less than 
        109 mg/day compared to those who reported higher vitamin C intakes <a href="crefs.html#ref44">(44)</a>. 
        A much larger study of 19,578 people, including 4,214 children from six 
        to 16 years of age, found higher serum vitamin C levels to be associated 
        with significantly lower blood lead levels <a href="crefs.html#ref45">(45)</a>. 
        A U.S. national survey of more than 10,000 adults found that blood lead levels were inversely related to serum vitamin C levels <a href="crefs.html#ref46">(46)</a>. An intervention trial that examined the effects of vitamin C supplementation 
        on blood lead levels in 75 adult male smokers found that 1,000 mg/day 
        of vitamin C resulted in significantly lower blood lead levels over a 
        four-week treatment period compared to placebo <a href="crefs.html#ref47">(47)</a>. 
        A lower dose of 200 mg/day did not significantly affect blood lead levels, 
        despite the finding that serum vitamin C levels were not different than 
        those in the group who took 1,000 mg/day. The mechanism for the relationship 
        between vitamin C intake and blood lead levels is not known, although 
        it has been postulated that vitamin C may inhibit intestinal absorption 
        or enhance urinary excretion of lead.</p>
		 <p><strong><a name="immunity"></a>Role in Immunity</strong></p>
		 <p>Vitamin C affects several components of the human immune system; for example, vitamin C has been shown to stimulate both the production <a href="crefs.html#ref48">(48-52)</a> and function <a href="crefs.html#ref53">(53, 54)</a> of <a href="../../glossary.html#leukocytes">leukocytes</a> (white blood cells), especially <a href="../../glossary.html#neutrophils">neutrophils</a>, <a href="../../glossary.html#lymphocyte">lymphocytes</a>, and <a href="../../glossary.html#phagocyte">phagocytes</a>.

Neutrophils, which attack foreign bacteria and viruses, seem to be the primary cell type stimulated by vitamin C, but lymphocytes and other phagocytes are also affected <a href="crefs.html#ref55">(55)</a>. Additionally, several studies have shown that supplemental vitamin C increases serum levels of <a href="../../glossary.html#antibodies">antibodies</a> <a href="crefs.html#ref56">(56, 57)</a> and C1q <a href="../../glossary.html#complement">complement proteins</a> <a href="crefs.html#ref58">(58-60)</a> in guinea pigs, which&mdash;like humans&mdash;cannot synthesize vitamin C and hence depend on dietary vitamin C. However, some studies have reported no beneficial changes in leukocyte production or function with vitamin C treatment <a href="crefs.html#ref61">(61-64)</a>. Vitamin C may also protect the integrity of immune cells. Neutrophils, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes accumulate vitamin C to high concentrations, which can protect these cell types from <a href="../../glossary.html#oxidative damage">oxidative damage</a> <a href="crefs.html#ref52">(52</a>, <a href="crefs.html#ref65">65, 66)</a>. In response to invading microorganisms, phagocytic leukocytes release non-specific toxins, such as superoxide radicals, hypochlorous acid (�bleach�), and peroxynitrite; these <a href="../../glossary.html#reactive oxygen species">reactive oxygen species</a> kill pathogens and, in the process, can damage the leukocytes themselves <a href="crefs.html#ref67">(67)</a>. Vitamin C, through its antioxidant functions, has been shown to protect leukocytes from such effects of autooxidation <a href="crefs.html#ref68">(68)</a>. Phagocytic leukocytes also produce and release <a href="../../glossary.html#cytokine">cytokines</a>, including interferons, which have antiviral activity <a href="crefs.html#ref69">(69)</a>. Vitamin C has been shown to increase interferon levels <a href="../../glossary.html#in vitro">in vitro</a> <a href="crefs.html#ref70">(70)</a>.</p>
		 <p>It is widely thought by the general public that vitamin C boosts the function of the immune system, and accordingly, may protect against viral infections and perhaps other diseases. While some studies suggest the biological plausibility of vitamin C as an immune enhancer, human studies published to date are conflicting. Further, controlled clinical trials of appropriate statistical power would be necessary to determine if supplemental vitamin C boosts the immune system. </p>

        studies have demonstrated a blood pressure lowering effect of vitamin

        It should be noted that those participants who were taking antihypertensive

      <p align="left"><strong>Cancer</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Studies in the 1970s and 1980s conducted by Linus Pauling, Ewan Cameron, 
        and colleagues suggested that very large doses of vitamin C (10 grams/day 
        intravenously for ten days followed by at least 10 grams/day orally indefinitely) 
        were helpful in increasing the survival time and improving the quality 
        of life of terminal cancer patients <a href="crefs.html#ref78">(78)</a>. 
        However, two randomized placebo-controlled studies conducted at the Mayo 
        Clinic found no differences in outcome between terminal cancer patients 
        receiving 10 grams/day of vitamin C orally or placebo <a href="crefs.html#ref56"> 
        (79, 80)</a>. There were significant methodological differences between 
        the Mayo Clinic and Pauling's studies, and recently, researchers from 
        the <a href="../../glossary.html#nih">NIH</a> suggested that the route 
        of administration (intravenous versus oral) may have been the key to the 
        discrepant results. Intravenous (IV) administration can result in much 
        higher blood levels of vitamin C than oral administration, and vitamin C levels 
        that are toxic to cancer cells in culture can be achieved in humans only
        with intravenous but not oral administration of vitamin C <a href="crefs.html#ref81">(81)</a>. Dr. Mark Levine and colleagues at NIH have investigated the anticancer mechanism responsible for vitamin C and reported that it involves production of hydrogen peroxide, which is selectively toxic to cancer cells <a href="crefs.html#ref82">(82-84)</a>. Thus, it appears reasonable to reevaluate the use of high-dose vitamin 
        C as <a href="../../glossary.html#adjunct">adjunctive</a> cancer therapy.</p>
      <p align="left">Currently, there are no results from controlled clinical 
        trials indicating that vitamin C would adversely affect the survival of 
        cancer patients. Recently, two phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer found that intravenous administration of vitamin C at doses up to 1.5 g/kg of body weight was well tolerated and safe in pre-screened patients <a href="crefs.html#ref85">(85, 86)</a>; other phase I trials are ongoing <a href="crefs.html#ref87">(87)</a>. Additionally, phase II clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of vitamin C in cancer treatment are currently under way <a href="crefs.html#ref87">(87)</a>. Some <a href="../../glossary.html#case reports">case reports</a> have suggested that intravenous vitamin C may aid in cancer treatment <a href="crefs.html#ref88">(88, 89)</a>.

        as well as in those with diabetes <a href="crefs.html#ref14">(14)</a>. In 
        contrast, a 15-year study of postmenopausal women found that diabetic 
        women who reported taking at least 300 mg/day of vitamin C from supplements 
        when the study began were at significantly higher risk of death from coronary 
        heart disease and stroke than those who did not take vitamin C supplements 
        <a href="crefs.html#ref91">(91)</a>. Vitamin C supplement use was not 
        associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular disease mortality 
        in the cohort as a whole. Although a number of <a href="../../glossary.html#observational study">observational 
        studies</a> have found that higher dietary intakes of vitamin C are associated 
        with lower cardiovascular disease risk, <a href="../../glossary.html#randomized controlled trial">randomized

        included vitamin C to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetic

      <p>It is possible that genetic differences may influence the effect of vitamin 
        C supplementation on cardiovascular disease. When the results of one randomized 
        controlled trial were reanalyzed based on haptoglobin genotype, antioxidant 
        therapy (1,000 mg/day of vitamin C + 800 IU/day of vitamin E) was associated with 
        improvement of coronary <a href="../../glossary.html#atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> 
        in diabetic women with two copies of the haptoglobin 1 gene but worsening 
        of coronary atherosclerosis in those with two copies of the haptoglobin

      <p align="left"><a name="cold"></a><strong>Common cold</strong></p>
      <p align="left">The work of Linus Pauling stimulated public interest in 
        the use of large doses (greater than 1 gram/day, also sometimes called "mega-doses") of vitamin C to prevent 
        the common cold <a href="crefs.html#ref95">(95)</a>. In the past 30 years, 
        numerous <a href="../../glossary.html#placebo">placebo</a>-controlled 
        trials have examined the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the prevention 
        and treatment of colds. A <a href="../../glossary.html#meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> 
        of 30 placebo-controlled prevention trials found that vitamin C supplementation 
        in doses up to 2 grams/day did not decrease the incidence of colds <a href="crefs.html#ref96">(96)</a>. 
        However, in a subgroup of marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers training 
        in the Arctic, doses ranging from 250 mg/day to 1 gram/day decreased the 
        incidence of colds by 50%. Overall, the preventive use of vitamin C supplementation 
        reduced the duration of colds by about 8% in adults and 14% in children. 
        Most of the prevention trials used a dose of 1 gram/day. When treatment was 
        started at the onset of symptoms, vitamin C supplementation did not shorten 
        the duration of colds in seven placebo-controlled trials at doses ranging 
        from 1-4 grams/day. Additionally, the same authors completed a meta-analysis of the 15 trials that assessed the effect of vitamin C on cold severity; no consistent evidence that vitamin C was beneficial in ameliorating cold symptoms was found in this analysis. Thus, the overall conclusion of this meta-analysis was that vitamin C is ineffective as a prophylactic against the common cold, but individuals under stress, such as those exposed to strenuous physical exercise or cold weather, may experience some therapeutic benefit <a href="crefs.html#ref96">(96)</a>. More recently, a randomized, double-blind (but not placebo-controlled) study reported that those who took 500 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C had a 66% lower risk for contracting three or more colds in a five-year period compared to those who took 50 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C <a href="crefs.html#ref97">(97)</a>. The authors of this study did not find any significant differences in the two groups when analyzing data regarding cold severity or duration. However, the doses used in this study were smaller than those used in most of the previous studies.</p>

<p>Some authors have asserted that the studies included in the above mentioned meta-analysis <a href="crefs.html#ref96">(96)</a> utilized daily doses of vitamin C that would be too low to observe a therapeutic benefit <a href="crefs.html#ref98">(98, 99)</a>. Additionally, results of a recent pharmacokinetic study suggest that dividing the daily dose and administering it several times throughout the day, thereby increasing dose frequency, would better sustain plasma ascorbate levels <a href="crefs.html#ref81">(81)</a>. Large-scale, controlled clinical trials using pharmacological doses of vitamin C are necessary to determine whether or not higher doses of vitamin C have any therapeutic value in preventing or treating the common cold.

      <p align="left">Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is available in many forms, 
        but there is little scientific evidence that any one form is better absorbed 
        or more effective than another. Most experimental and clinical research uses ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate.</p>
      
        
      <p align="left"><strong><i>Natural vs. synthetic vitamin C</i></strong></p>
      <p align="left">Natural and synthetic L-ascorbic acid are chemically identical 
        and there are no known differences in their biological activities or bioavailabilities
        <a href="crefs.html#ref101"> (101)</a>.</p>
        
      <p align="left"><strong><i>Mineral ascorbates</i></strong></p>
      <p align="left">Mineral salts of ascorbic acid are buffered and, therefore, 
        less acidic than ascorbic acid. Some people find them less irritating 
        to the gastrointestinal tract than ascorbic acid. Sodium ascorbate and 
        calcium ascorbate are the most common forms, although a number of other 
        mineral ascorbates are available. Sodium ascorbate provides 111 mg of sodium (889 mg of ascorbic acid) per 1,000 mg of sodium ascorbate, and calcium ascorbate generally provides 90-110 mg of calcium (890-910 mg of ascorbic acid) per 1,000 mg of calcium ascorbate.</p>
        
      <p align="left"><strong><i>Vitamin C with bioflavonoids</i></strong></p>
      <p align="left">Bioflavonoids are a class of water-soluble plant pigments 
        that are often found in vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables, especially 
        citrus fruits. There is little evidence that the bioflavonoids in most 
        commercial preparations increase the bioavailability or efficacy of vitamin 
        C <a href="crefs.html#ref102">(102)</a>. Studies in cell culture indicate that a number of flavonoids inhibit the transport of vitamin C into cells <a href="crefs.html#ref103">(103-105)</a>, and supplementation of rats with quercetin and vitamin C decreased the intestinal absorption of vitamin C  <a href="crefs.html#ref103">(103)</a>. More research is needed to determine the significance of these findings in humans. </p>
        
      <p align="left"><strong><i>Ascorbate and vitamin C metabolites</i></strong></p>
      <p align="left">One supplement, Ester-C<sup>�</sup> contains mainly 
        calcium ascorbate, but also contains small amounts of the vitamin C metabolites 
        dehydroascorbate (oxidized ascorbic acid), calcium threonate, and trace 
        levels of xylonate and lyxonate. Although the metabolites are supposed 
        to increase the bioavailability of vitamin C, the only published study 
        in humans addressing this issue found no difference between Ester-C<sup>�</sup> and commercially 
        available ascorbic acid tablets with respect to the absorption and urinary 
        excretion of vitamin C <a href="crefs.html#ref102">(102)</a>. Ester-C<sup>�</sup> 
        should not be confused with ascorbyl palmitate, which is also marketed 
        as &quot;vitamin C ester&quot; (see below).</p>
        
      <p align="left"><strong><i>Ascorbyl palmitate</i></strong></p>
      <p align="left">Ascorbyl palmitate is actually a vitamin C ester (i.e., vitamin 
        C that has been esterified to a fatty acid). In this case, vitamin C is 
        esterified to the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid, resulting in a 
        fat-soluble form of vitamin C. Ascorbyl palmitate has been added to a 
        number of skin creams due to interest in its antioxidant properties as 
        well as its importance in collagen synthesis <a href="crefs.html#ref106">(106)</a>. 
        Although ascorbyl palmitate is also available as an oral supplement, it 
        is likely that most of it is hydrolyzed (broken apart) to ascorbic acid 
        and palmitic acid in the digestive tract before it is absorbed <a href="crefs.html#ref107">(107)</a>. 
        Ascorbyl palmitate is also marketed as &quot;vitamin C ester,&quot; which 
        should not be confused with Ester-C<sup>�</sup> (see above).</p>

        confirmed, and there is no reliable scientific evidence that large amounts 
        of vitamin C (up to 10 grams/day in adults) are toxic or detrimental to 
        health. The concerns of kidney stone formation with vitamin C supplementation are discussed <a href="#kidney stones">below</a>. With the latest <a href="../../glossary.html#rda">RDA</a> published 
        in 2000, a tolerable upper intake level (<a href="../../glossary.html#ul">UL</a>) 
        for vitamin C was set for the first time. A UL of 2 grams (2,000 milligrams) 
        daily was recommended in order to prevent most adults from experiencing 
        diarrhea and <a href="../../glossary.html#gastrointestinal">gastrointestinal

      <p align="left"><strong>Does vitamin C promote oxidative damage under physiological 
        conditions?</strong> Vitamin C is known to function as a highly effective 
        <a href="../../glossary.html#antioxidant">antioxidant</a> in living organisms. 
        However, in test tube experiments, vitamin C can interact with some free 
        metal <a href="../../glossary.html#ion">ions</a> to produce potentially 
        damaging <a href="../../glossary.html#free radical">free radicals</a>. 
        Although free metal ions are not generally found under physiological conditions, 
        the idea that high doses of vitamin C might be able to promote oxidative 
        damage in vivo has received a great deal of attention. Widespread publicity 
        has been given to a few studies suggesting a <a href="../../glossary.html#prooxidant">pro-oxidant</a> 
        effect of vitamin C <a href="crefs.html#ref108"> (108, 109)</a>, but these 
        studies turned out to be either flawed or of no physiological relevance. 
        A comprehensive review of the literature found no credible scientific 
        evidence that supplemental vitamin C promotes oxidative damage under physiological 
        conditions or in humans <a href="crefs.html#ref110">(110)</a>. Studies that 
        report a pro-oxidant effect for vitamin C should be evaluated carefully 
        to determine whether the study system was physiologically relevant and 
        to rule out the possibility of methodological and design flaws.</p>
      <p align="left">For example, a study in the June 15, 2001 issue of the 
        journal <i><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=11408659&amp;dopt=Abstract" target="_top">Science</a></i> 
        reported that lipid hydroperoxides (rancid fat molecules) can react with 
        vitamin C to form products that could potentially harm DNA, although the 
        reaction of these products with DNA was not demonstrated in this study 
        <a href="crefs.html#ref108">(108)</a>. To find out why the Linus Pauling 
        Institute considers the study's conclusions unwarranted, see <a href="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/f-w01/cancer.html" target="_top"><strong>Vitamin 
        C doesn't cause cancer!</strong></a> in the Linus Pauling Institute Newsletter.</p>
		  <p align="left"><a name="kidney stones"></a><strong>Kidney Stones</strong></p>
<p align="left">Because oxalate is a <a href="../../glossary.html#metabolite">metabolite</a> of vitamin C, there is some concern that high vitamin C intake could increase the risk of oxalate <a href="../../glossary.html#kidney stones">kidney stones</a>. Some <a href="crefs.html#ref111">(111-113)</a>, but not all <a href="crefs.html#ref114">(114-116)</a>, studies have reported that supplemental vitamin C increases urinary oxalate levels. Whether any increase in oxalate levels would translate to an elevation in risk for kidney stones has been examined in <a href="../../glossary.html#epidemiologic study">epidemiological studies</a>. Two large <a href="../../glossary.html#prospective study">prospective studies</a>, one following 45,251 men for six years and the other following 85,557 women for 14 years, reported that consumption of &ge;1,500 mg of vitamin C daily did not increase the risk of kidney stone formation compared to those consuming <250 mg daily. However, a more recent prospective study that followed 45,619 men for 14 years found that those who consumed &ge;1,000 mg/day of vitamin C had a 41% higher risk of kidney stones compared to men consuming <90 mg of vitamin C daily&mdash;the current recommended dietary allowance (see <a href="#rda">RDA</a>; <a href="crefs.html#ref117">(117)</a>). In this study, low intakes (90-249 mg/day) of vitamin C (primarily from the diet) were also associated with a significantly elevated risk. Supplemental vitamin C intake was only weakly associated with increased risk of kidney stones in this study <a href="crefs.html#ref117">(117)</a>. Despite conflicting results, it may be prudent for individuals predisposed to oxalate kidney stone formation to avoid high-dose vitamin C supplementation. </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Drug Interactions</strong></p>
      <p align="left">A number of drugs are known to lower vitamin C levels, requiring 
        an increase in its intake. Estrogen-containing contraceptives (birth control 
        pills) are known to lower vitamin C levels in plasma and white blood cells. 
        Aspirin can lower vitamin C levels if taken frequently. For example, 
        taking two aspirin tablets every six hours for a week has been reported 
        to lower vitamin C levels in white blood cells by 50%, primarily by increasing urinary 
        excretion of vitamin C <a href="crefs.html#ref118">(118)</a>.</p>
      <p align="left">There is some evidence, though controversial, that vitamin 
        C interacts with anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) like warfarin 
        (Coumadin). Large doses of vitamin C may block the action of warfarin, 
        requiring an increase in dose to maintain its effectiveness. Individuals 
        on anticoagulants should limit their vitamin C intake to 1 gram/day and 
        have their prothrombin time monitored by the clinician following their 
        anticoagulant therapy. Because high doses of vitamin C have also been 
        found to interfere with the interpretation of certain laboratory tests 
        (e.g., serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the guaiac assay for occult 
        blood), it is important to inform one's health care provider of any recent 
        supplement use <a href="crefs.html#ref119">(119)</a>.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong><i><a name="mi"></a>Antioxidant Supplements and HMG-CoA Reductase 
        Inhibitors (Statins)</i></strong></p>
      <p align="left">A 3-year <a href="../../glossary.html#randomized controlled trial">randomized 
        controlled trial</a> in 160 patients with documented coronary heart disease 
        (CHD) and low <a href="../../glossary.html#hdl">HDL</a> levels found that 
        a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and niacin increased HDL<sub>2</sub> 
        levels, inhibited the progression of <a href="../../glossary.html#coronary artery">coronary 
        artery</a> stenosis (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of cardiovascular 
        events, such as <a href="../../glossary.html#myocardial infarction">myocardial infarction</a> (heart attack) and <a href="../../glossary.html#stroke">stroke</a> <a href="crefs.html#ref120">(120)</a>. 
        Surprisingly, when an antioxidant combination (1,000 mg vitamin C, 800 
        IU alpha-tocopherol, 100 mcg selenium, and 25 mg beta-carotene daily) 
        was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects 
        were diminished. Since the antioxidants were taken together in this trial, 
        the individual contribution of vitamin C cannot be determined. In contrast, 
        a much larger randomized controlled trial in more than 20,000 men and women with CHD or diabetes found that simvastatin and an antioxidant 
        combination (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg beta-carotene 
        daily) did not diminish the 
        cardioprotective effects of simvastatin therapy over a 5-year period <a href="crefs.html#ref121">(121)</a>. 
        These contradictory findings indicate that further research is needed 
        on potential interactions between antioxidant supplements and cholesterol-lowering 
        drugs, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).</p>

        <p align="center"> <a name="lpi_recommend"></a><strong>Linus Pauling Institute 
          Recommendation</strong></p>
      </center>
      <p align="left">For healthy men and women, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends a vitamin C intake 
        of at least 400 mg daily. Consuming at least five servings (2&frac12 cups)
       of fruits and 
        vegetables daily provides about 200 mg of vitamin C. Most multivitamin 
        supplements provide 60 mg of vitamin C. To make sure you meet the Institute�s recommendation, supplemental vitamin C in two separate 250-mg doses taken in the morning and evening is recommended.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Older adults (65 years and older)</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Although it is not yet known with certainty whether older 
        adults have higher requirements for vitamin C than younger people, some 
        older populations have been found to have vitamin C intakes considerably 
        below the RDA of 75 and 90 mg/day for women and men, respectively. A vitamin 
        C intake of at least 400 mg daily may be particularly important for older 
        adults who are at higher risk for chronic diseases. In addition, a meta-analysis of 36 publications examining the relationship between vitamin C intake and plasma concentrations of vitamin C concluded that older adults (age 60-96 years) have considerably lower plasma levels of vitamin C following a certain intake of vitamin C compared with younger individuals (age 15-65 years) <a href="crefs.html#ref122">(122)</a>, suggesting that older adults may have higher vitamin C requirements. Studies conducted at the National Institutes of Health indicated that plasma and circulating cells in healthy, young subjects attain near-maximal concentrations of vitamin C at a dose of about 400 mg/day�a dose much higher than the current RDA. Pharmacokinetic studies in older adults have not yet been conducted, but evidence suggests that the efficiency of one of the molecular mechanisms for the cellular uptake of vitamin C declines with age <a href="crefs.html#ref123">(123)</a>. Because maximizing blood levels of vitamin C may be important in protection against oxidative damage to cells and biological molecules, a vitamin C intake of at least 400 mg daily is particularly important for older adults who are at higher risk for chronic diseases caused, in part, by oxidative damage, such as heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, and cataract. </p>
