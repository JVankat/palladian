            <br />Internet News Record
            <br />  CoScripter is a Firefox plug-in
            <br />created by IBM Research, with the
            <br />aim of automating web processes.
            <br />CoScripter is described as a &quot;system
            <br />for recording, automating, and
            <br />sharing processes performed in a web
            <br />browser such as printing photos
            <br />online, requesting a vacation hold for
            <br />postal mail, or checking flight arrival
            <br />times.&quot; In effect it is a plug-in that
            <br />automates the browsing process for
            <br />certain tasks, through the use of
            <br />scripts. You don't need to be a
            <br />programmer to create scripts - just go
            <br />through the normal browsing
            <br />processes and CoScripter records it
            <br />for you. Alternatively you can simply
            <br />select and use a script that someone
            <br />else has built.
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   We recently spoke to Stefan
            <br />Nusser, Senior Manager of User
            <br />Systems and Experience Research at
            <br />IBM Research, to find out more
            <br />about CoScripter.
            <br />   First let's look at how CoScripter
            <br />works. Handily, there's a&quot;Getting
            <br />started with CoScripter&quot; script. It
            <br />shows that to execute a script, you
            <br />can run it in an automated function
            <br />(by clicking &quot;Run&quot;) and/or execute it
            <br />in a step-by-step process (clicking
            <br />&quot;Step&quot;). Typically a combination of
            <br />both, as many web processes require
            <br />human input (e.g. in forms).
            <br />CoScripter works by popping up a
            <br />sidebar in your browser, in which
            <br />you can see the steps as they execute.
            <br />As well as the script, there is also a
            <br />step-by-step textual explanation of
            <br />the process.
            <br />   As of now CoScripter has around
            <br />4000 scripts. A script which shows
            <br />the potential usefulness of CoScripter
            <br />in real-life scenarios is one for
            <br />adding your phone number to the
            <br />U.S. national do not call list. This is
            <br />an example of a multi-step process
            <br />which to many people is a pain to
            <br />carry out. Using this script, the user
            <br />is taken through the first couple of
            <br />webpages automatically, then it stops
            <br />at the point where the user needs to
            <br />enter their area code. Then the user is
            <br />guided step-by-step through the rest
            <br />of the process.
            <br />   Granted, well designed websites
            <br />will make it easy for their users to
            <br />work through processes. But we all
            <br />know that not all websites are easy to
            <br />navigate, so CoScripter comes in
            <br />handy in those circumstances. Not to
            <br />mention that some processes are just
            <br />very long and tiresome - e.g. the
            <br />request a vacation hold for postal
            <br />mail script is 14 steps long.
            <br />   For all its usefulness, there's a
            <br />sense that CoScripter is still too
            <br />geeky for mainstream people. We
            <br />found that using the 'Run' and 'Step'
            <br />links wasn't entirely intuitive.
            <br />   However we can certainly see the
            <br />potential for automating web
            <br />processes. One of the trends of the
            <br />current era of the Web is for
            <br />computers to do more of the 'heavy
            <br />lifting' of our daily tasks - whether
            <br />that be aggregating content, filtering
            <br />it, or automating it. CoScripter
            <br />clearly aims to do the latter. With a
            <br />bit more spit and polish, CoScripter
            <br />could eventually become a handy
            <br />tool to help your everyday web
            <br />browsing.
            <br />   We asked IBM's Stefan Nusser
            <br />what kind of uses he forsees for
            <br />CoScripter. He mentioned that it will
            <br />be useful within enterprises, where
            <br />there are typically many processes
            <br />that would benefit from automation.
            <br />He also mentioned a beta product
            <br />called Play-by-Play, a product built
            <br />on top of CoScripter and which uses
            <br />instant messaging for collaborative
            <br />browsing tasks such as customer
            <br />support and search.
            <br />   CoScripter comes from the same
            <br />team behind IBM's next-generation
            <br />browser platform Blue Spruce, which
            <br />was used to create an online
            <br />&quot;radiology theatre&quot; product. IBM is
            <br />focusing a lot on extending the
            <br />browser these days - and CoScripter
            <br />is another example of that. Check it
            <br />out and let us know what you think in
            <br />the comments. For the geekier
            <br />inclined, you can also incorporate
            <br />CoScripter into your own products.

            <br />  Thomson Reuters, the U.K.-based
            <br />news service, released News Pro
            <br />today, a new application for the
            <br />iPhone, iPod touch, and Blackberry
            <br />that gives users easy, almost real-
            <br />time access to Reuters' news wire.
            <br />We spent some time with the iPhone
            <br />version of the application today (
            <br />iTunes link), and while we like the
            <br />fact that the app gives us easy access
            <br />to a lot of great content, the
            <br />application itself could use a lot of
            <br />polishing, especially when compared
            <br />to some of its closest competitors
            <br />from the Associated Press ( iTunes
            <br />link) and Bloomberg ( iTunes link).
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   It should be noted that the iPhone
            <br />and BlackBerry apps are bit different.
            <br />According to PaidContent's David
            <br />Kaplan, the BlackBerry version is
            <br />more text-centric, while the iPhone
            <br />app puts more emphasis on Reuter's
            <br />video and photo content. The
            <br />BlackBerry app can be found here.
            <br />   Currently both apps are available
            <br />for free (with ads), but Thomson
            <br />Reuters is looking into a subscription
            <br />model as well, though according to
            <br />PaidContent, it will be a few months
            <br />before we will hear more details
            <br />about this. iPhone App Needs Polish
            <br />   We have seen a number of
            <br />impressive news applications for the
            <br />iPhone from prominent players like
            <br />the New York Times ( our review),
            <br />Wall Street Journal, the Associated
            <br />Press, the BBC, and Bloomberg.
            <br />Sadly, the Reuters app turned out to
            <br />be one of the weakest applications in
            <br />this group.
            <br />   Let's start with the good news.
            <br />While a lot of the other apps tend to
            <br />take a long time to start up and
            <br />update their news feeds (though the
            <br />Bloomberg app also starts up and
            <br />updates quite quickly), the Thomson
            <br />Reuters app is ready to go within
            <br />seconds.
            <br />   Unlike all of its competitors,
            <br />though, the Reuters app starts up
            <br />with the Top News feed by default,
            <br />and presents the rest of the news
            <br />categories in a long list, without the
            <br />ability to customize the order of these
            <br />categories. If you want the app to
            <br />show you the latest 'Internet News'
            <br />when you start the program, for
            <br />example, you are out of luck, as you
            <br />have to flick past the stories in the
            <br />'Top News' section first.
            <br />   All the other apps also allow users
            <br />to set shortcuts to their favorite
            <br />sections, while the shortcut menu in
            <br />the Reuters app is static (News,
            <br />Pictures, Video, Markets, and
            <br />Stocks).
            <br />   In terms of presentation, the image
            <br />section is nicely done, but the videos
            <br />look blocky (even with a fast
            <br />connection) and the Bloomberg app
            <br />does a way better job at showing
            <br />information about the stock market.
            <br />Verdict
            <br />   The app has a lot of potential,
            <br />especially thanks to the excellent and
            <br />timely content that Reuters is able to
            <br />offer. Sadly, the iPhone app currently
            <br />falls short and doesn't quite deliver
            <br />the experience to complement the
            <br />quality of the available content. It
            <br />should be relatively easy to rectify
            <br />some of these problems, though, and
            <br />we hope the see a new and better
            <br />version of the app soon. Discuss

            <br />  Ukrainian accused of involvement
            <br />in killing 29,000 Jews at Sobibor
            <br />death camp to undergo medical tests
            <br />   Germany was preparing to stage
            <br />one of the last Nazi trials today
            <br />following the long-awaited arrival
            <br />from the US of John Demjanjuk, who
            <br />faces charges that he helped to kill
            <br />29,000 Jews.
            <br />   Demjanjuk, 89, landed at Munich
            <br />airport early this morning after being
            <br />deported from his home in
            <br />Cleveland, Ohio, following his
            <br />family's failed attempts to block his
            <br />extradition on the grounds of ill
            <br />health.
            <br />   The retired car worker was
            <br />transferred through the morning mist
            <br />on a stretcher from the Gulfstream jet
            <br />into an ambulance of the Bavarian
            <br />Red Cross and taken to Stadelheim
            <br />prison in Munich, where he was due
            <br />to undergo medical tests to determine
            <br />whether he is fit to stand trial.
            <br />   The journey was a reversal of the
            <br />one he took 57 years ago when he
            <br />and his wife travelled from Munich
            <br />to Bremerhaven to board a ship to
            <br />New York. There he convinced
            <br />authorities of his status as a
            <br />&quot;displaced person&quot; and was allowed
            <br />entry into the US as a refugee,
            <br />becoming a citizen in 1958. It took
            <br />25 years before he began facing
            <br />questions about his alleged past and
            <br />32 years of repeated international
            <br />attempts before he was finally
            <br />extradited.
            <br />   Following his return to Germany
            <br />for the first time today a judge was
            <br />expected to formally charge
            <br />Demjanjuk with being an accessory
            <br />to the murder of 29,000 Jews while
            <br />he was a guard at the Nazi death
            <br />camp of Sobibor in occupied Poland
            <br />between March and September 1943.
            <br />   Eyewitnesses say he pushed men,
            <br />women and children into the gas
            <br />chambers.
            <br />   Ukraine-born Demjanjuk has
            <br />denied the charges, arguing that he
            <br />was drafted into the Soviet army and
            <br />spent much of the war as a prisoner
            <br />of war at the hands of the German
            <br />army and that he was never a camp
            <br />guard.
            <br />   Anton Winkler, of the Munich
            <br />prosecutors' office, said the charge
            <br />sheet stretched to 21 pages and there
            <br />was enough evidence to put
            <br />Demjanjuk on trial. &quot;We have his SS
            <br />membership card, as well as his
            <br />transfer orders, the authenticity of
            <br />which have been been verified,&quot; he
            <br />said.
            <br />   There are also written statements
            <br />from witnesses, all except one of
            <br />whom has died since giving evidence
            <br />against him.
            <br />   Prosecutors said it could take a
            <br />year before Demjanjuk is brought to
            <br />trial. If he is found guilty he could
            <br />face between three and 15 years in
            <br />prison. But what is certain is that he
            <br />will never be able to return to the US,
            <br />where his citizenship has been
            <br />revoked.
            <br />   Demjanjuk is at the top of the Nazi-
            <br />hunting Simon Wiesenthal Centre's
            <br />list of most wanted war crime
            <br />suspects.
            <br />   Jewish campaigners welcomed his
            <br />arrest. Charlotte Knobloch, head of
            <br />Germany's Central Council of Jews,
            <br />said she was &quot;relieved and pleased&quot;
            <br />at his deportation following months
            <br />of legal wrangling. But she stressed
            <br />the case was &quot;not about revenge, but
            <br />justice&quot; and urged the authorities to
            <br />push for a trial as soon as possible in
            <br />what she called a &quot;race against time&quot;.
            <br />   Demjanjuk's defence lawyers are
            <br />likely to argue that he has been
            <br />denied his rights because he will not
            <br />be able to see his family in the US
            <br />again  even if he is found not guilty
            <br /> and that he is too ill to stand trial
            <br />anyway.
            <br />   Demjanjuk's past began to catch up
            <br />with him in 1977 when US
            <br />authorities started investigating
            <br />allegations that he was involved in
            <br />Nazi crimes. In 1981 he was stripped
            <br />of his US citizenship and extradited
            <br />to Israel, where he was sentenced to
            <br />death after Holocaust survivors
            <br />identified him as the notorious guard
            <br />&quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; from the
            <br />Treblinka death camp. But the
            <br />conviction was overturned and the
            <br />death sentence quashed in 1993 after
            <br />doubt was thrown on the case.
            <br />   He returned to Cleveland and was
            <br />given US citizenship once again in
            <br />1998 until the following year, when
            <br />the US justice department reopened
            <br />its case against him. A federal judge
            <br />ordered his deportation in 2005 but
            <br />Demjanjuk repeatedly resisted
            <br />attempts to remove him until
            <br />Germany issued an arrest warrant
            <br />linking him to the Sobibor murders in
            <br />March.
            <br />   Demjanjuk's emotional departure
            <br />from his bungalow home last night,
            <br />following US immigration
            <br />authorities' decision to deport him,
            <br />was witnessed by journalists gathered
            <br />outside.
            <br />   His grandchildren and two priests
            <br />were among those who visited him to
            <br />say their farewells before he was put
            <br />in an ambulance and taken to the
            <br />airport. His granddaughter held a
            <br />floral-patterned bedsheet in front of
            <br />his stretcher to shield him from the
            <br />cameras.
            <br />   His son, John Demjanjuk Jr, told
            <br />Spiegel newspaper that he had spent
            <br />90 minutes speaking to his father
            <br />before he was put on the plane. &quot;I
            <br />told him that I was proud of
            <br />everything he'd been through  I
            <br />told him he had to be strong and that
            <br />we would be too.&quot;

            <br />Review If there's a genre of iPhone
            <br />app that's even more prevalent than
            <br />fart apps, it's file transfer and
            <br />viewing apps.
            <br />   File Magic 2.0(click opens iTunes)
            <br />is the newest entry into this market
            <br />from SplashData, an app
            <br />development firm with years of
            <br />history in the mobile space. As with
            <br />the other apps of this type, File
            <br />Magic provides a way to send files
            <br />from a Mac or PC to an iPhone or
            <br />iPod touch, then view those files on
            <br />the handheld.
            <br />   For those of you who are using
            <br />Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac,
            <br />you'll be happy to know that File
            <br />Magic supports the XML-based
            <br />.xlsx, .docx, and .pptx file formats
            <br />for viewing, as well as a number of
            <br />other document, sound, image, and
            <br />video file formats. Like Quickoffice,
            <br />File Magic does not support any of
            <br />the iWork file formats.

            <br />  ( S07E22)&quot;Why did you betray
            <br />me?&quot; - Jack
            <br />   Since next week's finale is actually
            <br />the last two hours of the season back-
            <br />to-back, I think it's safe to refer to
            <br />tonight's hour as Day 7's penultimate
            <br />episode. As is so often the case with
            <br />pivotal installments that precede a
            <br />finale (especially with 24), going into
            <br />it, I couldn't help shake the feeling
            <br />that the bio-terror threat would be
            <br />erased for good only to reveal one
            <br />more crisis ready to spill over into
            <br />next week. I'm not trying to say that
            <br />it was predictable, but ... well ...
            <br />nevermind. It was predictable.

            <br />dropping his cellphone or camera at

            <br />the shockproof, waterproof, and cold-
            <br />resistant Stylus 1050 SW can take the
            <br />beating from fumbles, faceplants or
            <br />full-speed crashes, and still keep
            <br />clicking.
            <br />   About the size and shape as a pack
            <br />of smokes, the 1050 is equipped with
            <br />an accelerometer letting you tinker
            <br />with settings by tapping on the top
            <br />and the sides. This lets you do useful
            <br />stuff like turn the flash on and off
            <br />with a gloved mitt or preview
            <br />pictures with one hand while you
            <br />fend off a tiger shark with the other.

            <br />you change settings without futzing
            <br />with buttons, and the camera can
            <br />handle alpine frigidity with aplomb.

            <br />greater media versatility.

            <br />easily than Ricky Henderson. The
            <br />battery is easily inserted backwards,
            <br />making you think it's dead or the

            <br />zoom and poor macro ability; this
            <br />camera could use a bifocal upgrade.

            <br />   Touted as the thinnest and lightest
            <br />BlackBerry yet, the Curve 8900 has
            <br />some much-needed upgrades over its
            <br />predecessor, but also some
            <br />disappointments.

            <br />camera got a bump to 3.2
            <br />megapixels, the 16 GB MicroSD
            <br />storage can hold up to 20 hours of
            <br />video, and the high-res screen is
            <br />fantastic in any light. On the other
            <br />hand, callers were hard to hear,
            <br />documents were difficult to create,
            <br />and RIM's revamped proprietary
            <br />browser is good for surfing the
            <br />Internet but isn't as smart about
            <br />automatically resizing webpages as
            <br />the browsers on competing
            <br />smartphones.

            <br />Brilliant, high-resolution screen is

            <br />adapters. Near 5-hour battery life is
            <br />most impressive.
            <br />   TIRED 3G is MIA. Despite the
            <br />powerful 512-Mhz processor, the

            <br />they should. Phone quality was

            <br />   This handset (which arrives in
            <br />some of the most gorgeous
            <br />packaging I've ever seen a consumer
            <br />electronic encased in) is almost
            <br />laughably banal in its actual
            <br />construction. A silver slider with
            <br />wide-spaced keys, it posses a passing
            <br />resemblance to the Nokia 5200,
            <br />albeit with a larger (2.2-inch) screen.
            <br />But, once you switch it on and start
            <br />using it, things begin to get
            <br />interesting.
            <br />   The operating system orbits around
            <br />Facebook synchronization. Basically
            <br />you take the phone online, pair it
            <br />with your Facebook account, and all
            <br />of your various Facebook
            <br />applications become active on the
            <br />mobile. Your Facebook address book
            <br />syncs up with the phone's address
            <br />book. Events from your Facebook
            <br />calendar become part of the phone's
            <br />calendar. Take a picture with the 3.2-
            <br />megapixel camera, and you can
            <br />automatically upload those shots to a
            <br />Facebook album.

            <br />   HP has been tinkering with touch
            <br />tech for a couple of years. But they
            <br />have yet to nail the bull's eye with a
            <br />machine that mixes mature hardware
            <br />with a haptic interface that feels like
            <br />more than just a half-assed effort. So,
            <br />we were cautiously optimistic with
            <br />the TouchSmart tx2z. The good
            <br />news? As HP's first multitouch
            <br />convertible tablet, it's got a lot of
            <br />potential.
            <br />   Converting from notebook to tablet
            <br />proved painless, thanks to a solid
            <br />hinge and the included pen. After
            <br />swinging the 1280 x 800 screen
            <br />around (and folding it back), we
            <br />found two goodies. First, using the
            <br />pen automatically disables the
            <br />touchscreen (to prevent palm-related
            <br />havoc), and second, HP included an
            <br />active digitizer for handwritten input.
            <br />This made reckless activities like e-
            <br />mailing while strolling around the
            <br />block surprisingly easy. Even jotting
            <br />down quick notes using a finger
            <br />(instead of the pen) gave us minimal
            <br />hassle.
            <br />   WIRED Fully baked as both a
            <br />touch and tablet device. Travels well
            <br />with its compact and stylish chassis.
            <br />Includes quick keys for rotating
            <br />screen orientation. Mini media
            <br />remote and pen conveniently hide
            <br />away in chassis. Altec Lansing
            <br />speakers strike decent balance
            <br />between volume and clarity. Extra
            <br />goodies aplenty: biometric security,
            <br />webcam, dual headphone jacks,
            <br />802.11n compatibility and 5-in-1
            <br />card reader.
            <br />   TIRED Bloated OS hinders
            <br />performance of otherwise decent
            <br />specs. Occasionally laggy switches
            <br />between notebook and tablet mode.

            <br />   Nero's LiquidTV TiVo PC looks
            <br />like a TiVo and acts like a TiVo, but,
            <br />brother, it ain't no TiVo.
            <br />   Actually, the package makes your
            <br />PC act like a TiVo by adding a USB
            <br />TV tuner and the same TiVo
            <br />software that drives the set-tops. You
            <br />also get a for-reals TiVo remote and
            <br />an IR receiver so you can command
            <br />content from the couch.
            <br />   Ironically, that's where you're
            <br />gonna get pissed. The remote can't
            <br />launch the software, so you'll have to
            <br />physically walk over and mouse it
            <br />open. The remote can be
            <br />programmed to turn your TV on and
            <br />off, but it can't put your PC in
            <br />standby mode or wake it up again. If
            <br />you do that manually, the IR receiver
            <br />fails to wake up with the rest of the
            <br />system.
            <br />   WIRED Includes a one-year TiVo
            <br />subscription, and after that it's a

            <br />Internet News Record
            <br />  Having written about copyright
            <br />issues for so long, we've started to
            <br />notice some trends. For instance,
            <br />many people try to twist copyright
            <br />law to the point where it only applies
            <br />when it helps them, and suddenly
            <br />doesn't apply when it helps them not
            <br />to have it apply. In fact, this is so
            <br />common that many people falsely
            <br />assume that the same is true of us --
            <br />claiming that we'd be pissed if people
            <br />copied our content (it's the usual
            <br />retort to those who are unsure of
            <br />copyright's benefits). Of course, for
            <br />us, it's not true. If people want to
            <br />copy our content for fun or for profit,
            <br />they're free to do so. Yet, it is true
            <br />that we often see people who should
            <br />know better freak out when it's &quot;their
            <br />content&quot; being used. These scenarios
            <br />never make anyone look good.
            <br />   You may recall the group NOM, an
            <br />advocacy group fighting against gay
            <br />marriage, that we talked about on this
            <br />site a few weeks ago because of a
            <br />bogus takedown notice it sent to
            <br />YouTube on content that it almost
            <br />certainly did not own the copyright
            <br />on. NOM also seemed to have no
            <br />sense of fair use.
            <br />   How quickly things change.
            <br />   NOM had no problem then taking 3
            <br />seconds of a clip from the blogger
            <br />known as Perez Hilton and putting it
            <br />in an advertisement. Perez Hilton the
            <br />played the role of the copyright
            <br />bully, sending a highly questionable
            <br />takedown notice, claiming the 3
            <br />seconds was copyright infringement.
            <br />Except, as pretty much anyone would
            <br />tell you, the use was almost certainly
            <br />fair use, and if anyone should know
            <br />that, it's Perez Hilton. Yet, it was
            <br />rather amusing to see NOM, just
            <br />weeks earlier a staunch questionable
            <br />takedown notice issuer, suddenly
            <br />finding themselves on the flipside,
            <br />defending fair use against a DMCA
            <br />takedown.
            <br />   And, how quickly things change
            <br />again. Because just as Hilton is
            <br />claiming that using 3 seconds of his
            <br />own video is copyright infringement
            <br />and not fair use, Ben Sheffner notes
            <br />that Hilton has posted a 10 minute
            <br />video of CNN footage, including his
            <br />own Perez TV overlay and his own
            <br />pre-roll ad at the beginning, along
            <br />with a single sentence beneath the
            <br />video.
            <br />   Personally, I think both uses should
            <br />be perfectly fine (the law, as it
            <br />currently stands, is more likely to
            <br />accept NOM's use, but not Hilton's),
            <br />it's still illustrative of the way many
            <br />people view copyright. It's an issue to
            <br />protect you, but it's a hindrance when
            <br />it gets in your way. Of course, we see
            <br />this quite often with politicians. It's
            <br />why Nicolas Sarkozy, who is pushing
            <br />for incredibly strict new laws relating
            <br />to copyright in France was found to
            <br />have ignored copyright law when it
            <br />suited him. We saw the same thing
            <br />last year when a Canadian politician
            <br />who was pushing for the Canadian
            <br />DMCA was caught infringing on
            <br />copyright himself.
            <br />   While some claim it's just
            <br />hypocrisy, I think it actually
            <br />represents one of the fundamental
            <br />flaws of copyright itself (or, really,
            <br />any monopoly system). Monopolies
            <br />aren't being used to create incentives
            <br />to create. They're used to stifle others
            <br />and to &quot;protect.&quot; These days, almost
            <br />everyone uses them and views them
            <br />as tools of protection rather than an
            <br />incentive to create. When you get so
            <br />far away from the entire purpose of
            <br />copyright law, you have a system
            <br />ripe for widespread abuse.

            <br />Story
            <br />  At the beginning of March, I
            <br />questioned the wisdom of Universal
            <br />Music and YouTube teaming up to
            <br />create a separate site just for
            <br />Universal Music, called Vevo. While
            <br />I thought it could be interesting, it
            <br />really depended on the execution,
            <br />and the early talk about it seemed to
            <br />miss the point. That is, it said that
            <br />YouTube would supply the
            <br />&quot;technology&quot; and Universal would
            <br />supply the music. Of course, what
            <br />that's missing is that much of the
            <br />value in YouTube isn't in the
            <br />technology (which many others have
            <br />replicated), but in the community.
            <br />So, if Vevo was to get anywhere, it
            <br />would need to recognize that fact,
            <br />rather than simply looking at
            <br />YouTube as a tech vendor.
            <br />   At the end of March, in a totally
            <br />separate post, I wrote about my
            <br />surprise at seeing my fellow keynote
            <br />presenter at the Leadership Music
            <br />Digital Summit, Rio Caraeff of
            <br />Universal Music, present a
            <br />reasonable vision for where the
            <br />music industry needed to be: getting
            <br />away from selling &quot;music&quot; and in
            <br />creating better, more valuable
            <br />experiences that simply can't be
            <br />replicated by file sharing. This was in
            <br />stark contrast to what Universal
            <br />Music's own CEO had been saying
            <br />for years. While Caraeff admitted
            <br />that it was still a struggle to get this
            <br />message through to everyone at
            <br />Universal, he believed in it strongly.
            <br />   That's why it's noteworthy that
            <br />Caraeff has now been put in charge
            <br />of the Vevo project. I'm still not
            <br />convinced it's anything more than a
            <br />boondoggle that will go nowhere
            <br />quickly, but putting Caraeff in charge
            <br />of it immediately makes it a much
            <br />more interesting project to follow.
            <br />The real question is what he does
            <br />with it, and whether the bosses back
            <br />at Universal Music actually give him
            <br />enough free reign to let him turn the
            <br />site into what it needs to be. I wish I
            <br />could be optimistic, but given the
            <br />major record labels' track record in
            <br />dealing with such things, I still think
            <br />the chances are pretty slim.

            <br />   Dry your eyes, plasma junkies. The
            <br />untimely demise of Pioneer's Kuro
            <br />line doesn't mean you'll have to forgo
            <br />those deliciously deep blacks and
            <br />theater-perfect colors for long. In
            <br />fact, even as the last of the Pioneer
            <br />Kuro Elites make its way into a few
            <br />lucky U.S. homes, a new lineup of
            <br />HDTV sets are already poised to
            <br />seize the plasma king's vacant throne.
            <br />   Key to this plasma's visual appeal
            <br />is its integrated THX mode. In
            <br />addition to blessing various audio
            <br />components, the home-theater ninjas
            <br />at THX began bestowing plasma and
            <br />LCD certification a few years back.
            <br />Each set is subjected to
            <br />approximately 400 individual tests,
            <br />ranging from evaluations in signal
            <br />processing to luminosity. Basically,
            <br />the idea behind G10's THX mode is
            <br />to recreate the precise color gamut
            <br />filmmakers use during the in-studio
            <br />post-production process.
            <br />   WIRED Mind-boggling blacks
            <br />with tons of detail. THX mode is a
            <br />godsend for movie buffs. Integrated
            <br />SD card slots transform your plasma
            <br />into a giant digital photo frame.
            <br />Amazing color saturation.
            <br />   TIRED THX mode is bit dim for

            <br />connectivity is nice for VieraCast,
            <br />but Wi-Fi would've been better.
            <br />Three HDMI ports (two in the back,
            <br />one on the side) don't cut it. More
            <br />power-hungry than LCD TVs.

            <br />   The PogoPlug is a device, which

            <br />plugs into almost any external hard
            <br />drive (even a USB stick) and then

            <br />and capable cellphone, but in most
            <br />others, it's dumber than the gorgeous

            <br />Internet News Record
            <br />  As part of the Streaming Media East
            <br />conference in New York, Adobe has
            <br />unveiled &quot; Strobe,&quot; the &quot;open
            <br />framework&quot; for its Flash video player
            <br />that the company first announced last
            <br />month. It's expected to be available
            <br />in the third quarter of this year.
            <br />   Since you were probably
            <br />wondering: No, Adobe is not
            <br />tweaking the pronunciation of
            <br />&quot;Strobe&quot; so that it rhymes. Thank
            <br />goodness.
            <br />   But here's what it is: Strobe is a
            <br />product and architecture for
            <br />accompanying plug-ins based on
            <br />Adobe's Flash technology that lets a
            <br />company build a custom video player
            <br />more easily, should it want to host
            <br />online videos in-house rather than
            <br />relying on YouTube or its ilk.
            <br />   While Adobe's ActionScript
            <br />language is &quot;very flexible,&quot; explained
            <br />Jennifer Taylor, director of product
            <br />management for Flash distribution,
            <br />&quot;everybody's sort of had to recreate
            <br />that from scratch, and as a result it's
            <br />taken people longer than they've
            <br />wanted to to to get their video
            <br />players up to get their video online.&quot;
            <br />   The meat of Tuesday's
            <br />announcement at Streaming Media
            <br />East is that a host of big new partners
            <br />are on board, from content delivery
            <br />networks to analytics firms. The full
            <br />list of supporters is Adap.tv, Akamai,
            <br />Blip.tv, Brightcove, CDNetworks,
            <br />Digital Smiths, Eyewonder,
            <br />GlanceGuide, Grab Media, Incited
            <br />Media, iStreamplanet, KickApps,
            <br />Level3, Limelight Networks,
            <br />Multicast, Nielsen, Omniture,
            <br />Panache, PointRoll, ScanScout,
            <br />Thumbplay, Visible Measures, and
            <br />YuMe.
            <br />   Strobe is &quot;taking the mystery out of
            <br />creating video players, and also
            <br />streamlining and simplifying that
            <br />process, so people can do it much
            <br />faster than they could before,&quot; Taylor
            <br />said. She added that ComScore
            <br />statistics have said that Flash is used
            <br />to serve up 80 percent of all online
            <br />videos.
            <br />   While Adobe is calling the project
            <br />an &quot;open framework&quot; and is inviting
            <br />developers to contribute, the
            <br />company has not yet hinted whether
            <br />the code will be released under an
            <br />open-source license, either initially
            <br />or down the road. CNET News has
            <br />contacted the company to clarify.
            <br />   But regardless of license, the
            <br />Strobe framework will be free, and
            <br />Adobe does not have plans to charge
            <br />for it. &quot;Our intent is to not monetize
            <br />Strobe directly,&quot; Taylor said.
            <br />&quot;Obviously, we anticipate and hope
            <br />that Strobe will help accelerate the
            <br />adoption of Flash video, and the
            <br />rising tide helps all boats: it's going
            <br />to help our partners and those who
            <br />provide plug-ins for the framework.&quot;

            <br />   Friend Lists has long been an
            <br />underused feature in Facebook. The
            <br />feature allows users to split their
            <br />friends up into different groups,
            <br />choosing different privacy settings
            <br />for each one. It is clear now that
            <br />Facebook has bigger plans for the
            <br />feature and it's getting serious about
            <br />trying to persuade people to use it.
            <br />Recently, Facebook automatically
            <br />created Friend Lists for its users in an
            <br />effort to help them filter and better
            <br />consume their Live Stream. Now,
            <br />Facebook has redesigned their Chat
            <br />feature in order to take advantage of
            <br />Friend Lists. Users can now organize
            <br />their previously unwieldy Chat lists
            <br />into groups, defined by their Friend
            <br />Lists.
            <br />   Upon loading up Chat for the first
            <br />time since this change, Facebook
            <br />users are prompted to say which
            <br />Friend Lists they want to add to Chat.
            <br />Users can segment these friends into
            <br />sublists for Chat, and everyone else
            <br />gets dumped into a generic &quot;Other
            <br />Friends&quot; list. This alone is going to
            <br />be enough for a lot of users to put
            <br />these previously uncategorized
            <br />friends into a List. While there
            <br />apparently wasn't enough motivation
            <br />for users to group their friends
            <br />before, now that they are grouping
            <br />them for the purposes of a clean Chat
            <br />list, the rest of the functionality of
            <br />Friend Lists throughout the site is
            <br />unlocked. Suddenly users can now
            <br />filter by these Lists that they have
            <br />taken the time to create, send Inbox
            <br />messages to whole lists, and create
            <br />customized privacy settings. I have
            <br />no doubt that Facebook has more
            <br />plans for Friend Lists as well.
            <br />   Not only does this new grouping by
            <br />Friend Lists give users a cleaner view
            <br />of their online friends, but users can
            <br />also toggle whether they appear
            <br />offline or online for a certain group.
            <br />This is yet another feature that is
            <br />going to provoke people to start
            <br />organizing their friends.
            <br />   Facebook has been doing a lot of
            <br />work lately, building new
            <br />functionality into the site. On Friday,
            <br />the site brought &quot;refresh alerts&quot; to its
            <br />home page and now it just rolled out
            <br />this newly enhanced Chat. It looks
            <br />like the Facebookers are working
            <br />overtime to try to win back the hearts
            <br />of some of the users that they
            <br />angered in their last major redesign.

            <br />  David Smith meets award-winning
            <br />Zimbabwean playwright Cont
            <br />Mhlanga, whose work grows sharper
            <br />as government harassment of him
            <br />increases
            <br />   Leaning forward with my
            <br />Dictaphone in the front room of a
            <br />bed and breakfast, I asked Cont
            <br />Mhlanga, gap-toothed playwright and
            <br />dissident, what constraints there were
            <br />on free expression in his native
            <br />Zimbabwe.
            <br />  &quot;You have no idea,&quot; he said,
            <br />looking at me fixedly. &quot;You have no
            <br />idea.&quot;
            <br />   Mhlanga has been a constant thorn
            <br />in the side of president Robert
            <br />Mugabe. After the curtain call at one
            <br />of his earliest plays, officials from
            <br />the state took to the stage to
            <br />denounce him and his work. How
            <br />dare he criticise the black heroes of
            <br />the liberation?
            <br />   Asked to explain himself there and
            <br />then, Mhlanga, himself black, said
            <br />his writing had spoken for him. The
            <br />actors were asked, but said they
            <br />could not speak for the playwright.
            <br />Then members of the audience spoke
            <br />up to praise the work for giving them
            <br />a voice.
            <br />   I asked Mhlanga how far he had
            <br />dared go with his most recent play,
            <br />The Good President, which was as
            <br />bitterly sarcastic and thinly disguised
            <br />as the title suggests.
            <br />   Remarkably, it played in Harare
            <br />under the president's nose. After each
            <br />performance, Mhlanga would sit
            <br />down and discuss it with his
            <br />audience. Each night, he noticed a
            <br />series of secret policemen taking a
            <br />seat, each more senior than the one
            <br />before, all equally stony-faced.
            <br />   But when he took the play to
            <br />Matabeleland something snapped.
            <br />The actors were in their dressing
            <br />rooms, the audience were in their
            <br />seats, when police arrived and
            <br />ordered Mhlanga to cancel. He
            <br />refused. They went away but came
            <br />back in the cars and garb of traffic
            <br />cops, making it appear that he would
            <br />be arrested for speeding.
            <br />  &quot;Go on stage now and tell them
            <br />there is no play tonight,&quot; they told
            <br />him. He replied: &quot;I will not tell them.
            <br />You must tell them.&quot; So the show did
            <br />not go on. But the following night,
            <br />Mhlanga decided to try again.
            <br />   The first scene played without
            <br />incident. Then, uproar. Armed police
            <br />stormed the auditorium, descending
            <br />from the balcony and shouting at
            <br />people to leave or face the
            <br />consequences. The audience fled in
            <br />panic. At that point, Mhlanga called
            <br />the production off, realising that
            <br />someone could get hurt. This is a
            <br />man who will sacrifice himself, but
            <br />not others, for his art.
            <br />   It is apparently Robert Mugabe's
            <br />intention to render political theatre
            <br />invisible in today's Zimbabwe. So
            <br />Mhlanga turned the idea against him
            <br />with what he calls &quot;invisible theatre&quot;.
            <br />He took unknown actors into
            <br />shopping malls to act out scenes and
            <br />interact with the public. Sometimes,
            <br />after the actors had moved on, the
            <br />public were still debating. But
            <br />eventually, even these guerrilla
            <br />performances came under the
            <br />scrutiny of spies in the crowd.
            <br />   I asked Mhlanga how old he is. It
            <br />was the only question he refused to
            <br />answer, stroking his white beard and
            <br />telling my Dictaphone that he is &quot;an
            <br />old man&quot;. It struck me that he was
            <br />enduring a warped existence that
            <br />might come from the darkest recesses
            <br />of Franz Kafka's imagination.
            <br />   Posters for his plays are torn down.
            <br />Stories appear in newspapers
            <br />painting him as an enemy of the
            <br />people. Secret policemen let it be
            <br />known that they are looking for him.
            <br />How? They visit his home in the
            <br />knowledge he is not there so the
            <br />word will get out. They question
            <br />neighbours, market traders and actors
            <br />about him, so he will soon learn they
            <br />are on his trail. &quot;Then I have a
            <br />choice,&quot; he says. &quot;Do I stay and
            <br />maybe die, or do I run for the
            <br />border?&quot;
            <br />   He could go into exile, and yet he
            <br />decides to stay and fight with the
            <br />only weapon he has: the pen. One
            <br />time, detained at the central police
            <br />station, he decided that if he was
            <br />going to jail he would start an
            <br />outreach programme to bring theatre
            <br />into prisons. He was released, but
            <br />started the outreach programme all
            <br />the same.
            <br />   Mhlanga's international reputation
            <br />is now his best defence. Whenever he
            <br />is brought in for questioning, the
            <br />news spreads like wildfire and the
            <br />outcry soon brings about his release.
            <br />There is now effectively a ban on his
            <br />work except in a village where he got
            <br />himself elected councillor.
            <br />   Just as the Market Theatre in South
            <br />Africa held up a mirror to apartheid,
            <br />so Mhlanga believes in the power of
            <br />theatre to change Zimbabwe. He
            <br />says: &quot;Art is most important of all.
            <br />With the news you only get one
            <br />version of events. Art is the best way
            <br />of telling the rest of the world what is
            <br />happening.&quot;
            <br />   And inevitably, every play
            <br />currently performed in Zimbabwe
            <br />crackles with political significance.
            <br />&quot;You can't get more political than
            <br />Shakespeare, who wrote about
            <br />kings,&quot; Mhlanga says. &quot;But even
            <br />when you tell a joke in the street, that
            <br />is political. When there is so much
            <br />going on, everything is political.&quot;
            <br />   I wished I had a camera when he
            <br />got up and showed me his impression
            <br />of Mugabe descending the stairs
            <br />from a plane, dancing nimbly and
            <br />preening his jacket. The urban myth
            <br />has it that the president flies to China
            <br />before his birthday every year to be
            <br />drained of all his blood, then
            <br />replenished with the blood of the
            <br />young.
            <br />   We were talking in Pretoria on the
            <br />eve of Jacob Zuma's inauguration as
            <br />South African president. We agreed
            <br />that, for all their country's problems,
            <br />South African journalists and writers
            <br />enjoy freedoms that Mhlanga can
            <br />only dream about.
            <br />   Finally, after an hour and a half, I
            <br />stopped recording and wished him
            <br />well. Mhlanga was about to head to
            <br />London, where last year he won the
            <br />inaugural Orient Global Freedom to
            <br />Create prize, which honours the role
            <br />of the arts in promoting human
            <br />rights.
            <br />   I thought about South Africa's own
            <br />recent struggle as I climbed past
            <br />statues and war memorials in the
            <br />grounds of the Union Buildings. The
            <br />crowds roared and whistled as Zuma
            <br />was sworn in. Then I looked down
            <br />and felt in my pocket. My
            <br />Dictaphone had gone, liberated by a
            <br />light-fingered thief. My conversation
            <br />with Mhlanga had gone with it. It
            <br />was not, I hoped, an augury at the
            <br />inauguration.

            <br />Internet News Record
            <br />  If Warner Bros. had their own
            <br />Facebook profile, their most recent
            <br />status update would inevitably read,
            <br />Warner Bros. went from being
            <br />single to being in a relationship
            <br />with Facebook.
            <br />   Why, you ask? Thats because the
            <br />two have just inked a deal to allow
            <br />viewers to simultaneously watch
            <br />Watchmen on Blu-ray Disc Live (BD
            <br />-Live) while exchanging comments
            <br />with their Facebook friends.
            <br />   Even though BD-Live viewers
            <br />could already connect with each
            <br />other mid-screening, the new
            <br />Facebook deal adds a greater
            <br />community element - i.e. Facebooks
            <br />200 million users- to the video
            <br />watching experience. According to
            <br />the Hollywood Reporter, there was
            <br />no money exchanged in the deal,
            <br />which will let users sync their BD-
            <br />Live buddy lists with their friend
            <br />networks on Facebook.
            <br />   Only the Blu-ray Watchmen
            <br />Directors Cut will have the
            <br />additional layer of social
            <br />connectivity, and it will be made
            <br />available in late July via iTunes and
            <br />Amazon on Demand for $35.99.
            <br />   And even though wed love to
            <br />think that studios are starting to get
            <br />hip to the joys of social media, the
            <br />reality is something a little less
            <br />flowery. Studio execs and Blu-ray
            <br />proponents are hoping that the
            <br />additional goodies, coupled with the
            <br />Facebook integration, will make the
            <br />premium DVD alluring to audiences
            <br />even at the much higher price point.
            <br />   Regardless of rhyme or reason, the
            <br />Warners and Facebook deal
            <br />represents a huge step forward in
            <br />bringing our social graph to entities
            <br />beyond the Web for our personal
            <br />computers. We see todays news as
            <br />not just an advancement in BD-Live
            <br />technology, but a look towards the
            <br />future of movie watching trends and
            <br />behaviors. Reviews: Blu, Facebook

            <br />  Ever since the launch of social
            <br />networking application platforms on
            <br />Facebook, MySpace, and others,
            <br />gaming has taken a sharp turn
            <br />towards social media. For many,
            <br />playing games is best as a shared
            <br />experience on consoles, so it makes
            <br />sense that companies would utilize
            <br />social media to build stickier games.
            <br />Yet its still amazing how rapidly
            <br />social gaming is growing.
            <br />   Case-in-point? Zynga, the social
            <br />game and application developer,
            <br />reached a big milestone this week,
            <br />surpassing 10 million daily active
            <br />users across its portfolio of social
            <br />games. Having that many
            <br />simultaneous players every day is an
            <br />impressive feat, and this is just one
            <br />application company.
            <br />   Zynga develops games primarily
            <br />for Facebook, other social networks,
            <br />and the iPhone. Some of its most
            <br />popular interactive applications
            <br />include Scramble, Mafia Wars, and
            <br />Texas HoldEm Poker. They have
            <br />become big hits not only because of
            <br />their gameplay, but also because of
            <br />the ability to do things like challenge
            <br />and compete with Facebook friends.
            <br />   This is the social media in action -
            <br />its simply a more relevant and
            <br />meaningful experience when youre
            <br />playing against your best friend.
            <br />   There are plenty of other
            <br />companies in the space doing big
            <br />things as well, including Playfish and
            <br />Social Gaming Network(SGN).
            <br />Combined, these companies and their
            <br />games have experienced strong
            <br />growth and raised some serious
            <br />money. The growth of the iPhone as
            <br />a gaming platform has only been a
            <br />boon to these companies as well.
            <br />   Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft:
            <br />you should be on guard, because
            <br />social media is making some major
            <br />headway in your industry. Maybe we
            <br />could have Facebook Connect
            <br />integration with the next Mario
            <br />game? Reviews: Facebook, MySpace
            <br />   Tags: social gaming, Zynga
            <br />  About a year ago, Facebook
            <br />launched its own IM system, FbChat.
            <br />And while its a useful way to
            <br />connect with friends directly, there
            <br />are still many people who dont use it
            <br />for one reason for another. Now
            <br />though, Facebooks added another
            <br />great reason to use FbChat with the
            <br />release of Friend Lists within
            <br />FbChat.
            <br />   Not only is the ability to create and
            <br />edit Friend Lists available from the
            <br />Facebook chat bar, but you can now
            <br />control who sees you online via
            <br />friend lists. Say you want to be on
            <br />FbChat, but dont want your
            <br />coworkers to see that youre online.
            <br />Now you can simply exclude your co
            <br />-workers friend list from chat and
            <br />viola! - youre invisible to just them.
            <br />   This type of control has never been
            <br />available in FbChat, and is really
            <br />only something that Facebook can do
            <br />with its large social graphs and its
            <br />useful friend lists feature. The ability
            <br />to only have your favorite group of
            <br />friends appear in chat and to control
            <br />who sees you online is a significant
            <br />advancement for the social networks
            <br />IM product.
            <br />   The new FbChat comes with two
            <br />tabs in order to execute this
            <br />functionality - Friend Lists, which is
            <br />where you edit and display specific
            <br />lists, and Options, which is where
            <br />you can now change FbChat settings.
            <br />To disappear from FbChat for a
            <br />specific list, you just have to move in
            <br />-chat sliders from the on position
            <br />(green) to the off position (grey).
            <br />   Just like most of Facebooks site-
            <br />wide changes, this one is being rolled

            <br />  Evernote is one of our readers'
            <br />favorite note-taking tools, its iPhone
            <br />app is one of our must-haves, so
            <br />we're guessing BlackBerry users will
            <br />be happy to know that Evernote is
            <br />now available for the BlackBerry.
            <br />   Evernote for BlackBerry can create
            <br />notes containing text, images, audio
            <br />recordings, and file attachments on-
            <br />the-go, and like the iPhone version,
            <br />any note you create from your
            <br />BlackBerry will be automatically
            <br />uploaded to and synced with
            <br />Evernote wherever you have it
            <br />installed. Likewise, the BlackBerry
            <br />app supports viewing, searching, and
            <br />filtering all of your notes. Currently
            <br />the Evernote for BlackBerry requires
            <br />BlackBerry OS 4.6, but more devices
            <br />will be added in time. We haven't
            <br />been able to put it through the paces
            <br />next to its iPhone counterpart, so if
            <br />you give it a try, let's hear how you
            <br />like it in the comments. Evernote for

            <br />in a camp for earthquake survivors.
            <br />But a cosy -armchair sits in a corner
            <br />and a bright curtain screens off their
            <br />bed. In their laps, the couple hold
            <br />cherished possessions from the days
            <br />before the disaster: framed
            <br />photographs of his late wife and her
            <br />late husband.
            <br />   Today will mark the first
            <br />anniversary of the 7.9-magnitude
            <br />shock that tore through Sichuan,
            <br />killing up to 90,000 and leaving 5
            <br />million people homeless. In
            <br />Beichuan, where the couple lived, as
            <br />few as 4,000 of the town's 22,000
            <br />residents survived. Most were
            <br />separated from those they loved  the
            <br />quake struck in early afternoon, when
            <br />families were scattered across fields,
            <br />-factories, shops and schools.
            <br />   For both Huajun and Yuncui, it
            <br />destroyed marriages spanning two
            <br />decades. Yet eight months later, in
            <br />January, they chose to wed again.
            <br />   At least 600 survivors from the
            <br />town have remarried and officials
            <br />hope that more will follow in the
            <br />near future. The authorities have paid
            <br />for group weddings and plan to hold
            <br />a matchmaking fair. A local women's
            <br />group has hired an agent to help
            <br />widows find love again.
            <br />   These &quot;restructured families&quot; offer
            <br />more than emotional support.
            <br />Sichuan is a poor region. Households
            <br />with two adults are more likely to
            <br />support themselves financially. They
            <br />also require not two homes but one,
            <br />lessening the strain of the mammoth
            <br />reconstruction programme.
            <br />   Yang Yongfu, Beichuan's deputy
            <br />civil affairs chief, has warned that
            <br />remarriage will be &quot;anything but
            <br />easy&quot;. Enduring grief, and disputes
            <br />over property, children and
            <br />responsibilities, all pile pressure on
            <br />couples. &quot;These new families often
            <br />have children and in-laws from the
            <br />previous marriage. Some families
            <br />need to care for eight elderly people
            <br />and four children,&quot; he added.
            <br />   Huajun and Yuncui's children are
            <br />grown up and supported their parents'
            <br />decision. But her son Wang Cao slips
            <br />from the room, eyes red with grief, as
            <br />his mother recalls his &quot;gentle,
            <br />hardworking&quot; father.
            <br />  &quot;Sometimes she talks about her late
            <br />husband and I mention my late wife.
            <br />We trust each other,&quot; said Huajun.
            <br />   Both were away from their homes
            <br />when the quake struck at 2.28pm on
            <br />12 May 2008. Struggling to his feet,
            <br />Huajun looked across the valley to
            <br />his house and saw only a mound of
            <br />rubble.
            <br />   Yuncui survived because she was
            <br />slow to escape from the third floor of
            <br />her factory. Seven women fleeing
            <br />ahead of her disappeared as the
            <br />staircase collapsed. Then the roof fell
            <br />in, pinning her and her colleague
            <br />under rubble.
            <br />  &quot;We screamed for help all afternoon
            <br />but no one came. We had no idea
            <br />how terrible it was outside,&quot; she said.
            <br />   Buildings had keeled over or
            <br />crumbled, landslides had buried large
            <br />parts of the town and boulders the
            <br />size of cars had crushed everything in
            <br />their path.
            <br />   Glimpsing a tiny speck of daylight,
            <br />Yuncui vowed to work herself free.
            <br />Hours later, she hauled herself out
            <br />and pulled her friend free. They
            <br />stepped off the building: the third
            <br />floor now stood just one metre above
            <br />ground.
            <br />   Across town, her home had
            <br />collapsed upon her husband. &quot;I
            <br />couldn't accept that he was gone.
            <br />Every man I saw looked like him,&quot;
            <br />she said.
            <br />   In August, she was among 5,000
            <br />survivors to move into the settlement
            <br />in Mianyang. A few streets away,
            <br />Huajun was living alone and drinking
            <br />heavily: &quot;I hoped to make myself
            <br />numb,&quot; he said. But when his aunt
            <br />introduced him to Yuncui he could
            <br />not help noticing both her sweet
            <br />nature and her dogged independence.
            <br />She was struck by his respect for her
            <br />children and his dedication to his job
            <br />as a community worker. A few
            <br />months later, they wed.
            <br />   The accelerated pace of their
            <br />relationship reflects the speed with
            <br />which survivors have tried to rebuild
            <br />their lives. In Yongxing there are
            <br />grocery shops, cafes, and a shop
            <br />selling TV sets and electric fans.
            <br />New year messages are pasted at the
            <br />doorways and neighbours gather to
            <br />chat. But the illusion of normality is
            <br />a thin one. Families of six are often
            <br />squeezed into these little cubes, and
            <br />the sound of the television next door
            <br />reverberates through slight walls.
            <br />Outside, posters along the streets
            <br />illustrate common trauma symptoms.
            <br />   The government has promised
            <br />Beichuan residents permanent homes
            <br />by the end of the year. But despite
            <br />impressive reconstruction efforts, the
            <br />scale of need remains overwhelming.
            <br />Across the earthquake zone, some
            <br />still live in makeshift shelters of
            <br />planks and canvas. Others wonder
            <br />how to scrape together cash for even
            <br />the affordable new homes promised
            <br />by the government. There is plenty of
            <br />casual labour on construction sites,
            <br />but few long-term jobs on offer.
            <br />   In this transient environment,
            <br />people who have lost everything
            <br />yearn for a new anchor.
            <br />  &quot;In the older generation, Chinese
            <br />people didn't remarry after their
            <br />spouse died,&quot; said Zhang Yong, the
            <br />settlement's burly policeman, who
            <br />wed again recently. &quot;But if you live
            <br />alone there's no one to talk to and
            <br />share your thoughts with. My wife
            <br />lost her son so her hurt is even worse
            <br />than mine.&quot;
            <br />   He hoped for companionship,
            <br />financial stability and a maternal
            <br />influence for his 11-year-old twin
            <br />daughters. But his home unit lacks
            <br />the cosiness of Yuncui and Huajun's.
            <br />It is sparsely furnished, with a desk
            <br />but no sofa and bunk beds in the
            <br />corner. A pink plastic mirror taped to
            <br />the wall is the sole feminine touch.
            <br />  &quot;Legally we are married, but not
            <br />-practically,&quot; he said. His new wife is
            <br />an official too, assigned to a centre
            <br />two hours away. His daughters board
            <br />at school in the week. When shifts
            <br />work out, they see each other
            <br />weekly; more often, they snatch a
            <br />day or so each fortnight. For Zhang,
            <br />as for millions across Sichuan, the
            <br />warmth and security of his past life
            <br />remains a distant dream.
            <br />   He pulled on his cigarette and
            <br />gazed at the ceiling. &quot;After
            <br />everything settles down we will all
            <br />live together and make a real family,&quot;
            <br />he promised himself.

            <br />  (S02E24) &quot;If you think we're bad,
            <br />you should have seen our parents.&quot; -
            <br />Gossip Girl about those who
            <br />complain about today's youth
            <br />   After weeks, if not months, of
            <br />hearing about it, we finally saw what
            <br />the Gossip Girl spin off could be like.
            <br />Set in the 80s, the spin off would star
            <br />Brittany Snow as a young Lily,
            <br />Krysten Ritter as her sister Carol, and
            <br />Andrew McCarthy as their father.
            <br />The action would, as expected,
            <br />follow Lily's life as a young woman
            <br />trying to make sense of the world and
            <br />find her place in it.
            <br />   This past week, the Internet has
            <br />been filled with reports that the
            <br />potential spin off was dead even
            <br />before this week's episode aired.
            <br />Other reports claimed that there was
            <br />still a chance for the spin off to be
            <br />picked up and find its way on The
            <br />CW's 2009-2010 schedule. How
            <br />about we don't listen to those reports
            <br />and make our own decision on if the
            <br />network should give the spin off a
            <br />chance?

            <br />   It seems as if Castle just started and

            <br />did just start, in a way, as it didn't

            <br />  Toshiba's Cell-based SpursEngine
            <br />HD video co-processor has made
            <br />plenty of appearances within
            <br />monstrous gaming machines, but this
            <br />marks the very first time where it has
            <br />stepped out of the laptop chassis and
            <br />into a portable enclosure. Granted,
            <br />the language barrier is killing us
            <br />here, but it seems as if the Leadtek
            <br />WinFast HPVC1100 wraps a
            <br />SpursEngine encoder into an on-the-
            <br />go solution that can be lugged around
            <br />with a standard laptop in order to
            <br />churn through video while on set, in
            <br />the field or on the road. Other specs
            <br />include 128MB of RAM, a PCI-
            <br />Express slot and a weight of 1.54
            <br />pounds; there's no word just yet on
            <br />pricing or availability. One more shot
            <br />is after the break.

            <br />  Remember the halcyon days of
            <br />2007, when Beyonce's
            <br />&quot;Irreplaceable&quot; rocked the charts and
            <br />Samsung revealed its 30-nm
            <br />manufacturing process, promising a
            <br />128GB memory card in every
            <br />digicam? We're still not quite there
            <br />yet, but the company is finally
            <br />releasing the first cards to utilize that
            <br />manufacturing process, the biggest
            <br />offering 32GB of storage goodness.
            <br />That's twice the capacity of its 40nm
            <br />cards, which never made it past the
            <br />16GB mark. 30nm moviNAND chips
            <br />are in production now in 4GB, 8GB,
            <br />16GB, and 32GB sizes, and
            <br />hopefully will hit retail before that 33
            <br />megapixel Mamiya we've had on

            <br />  Aw, snap. Just when you thought
            <br />the 4K market couldn't get any more
            <br />dominated by RED and the gang,
            <br />along comes JVC to shake things up.
            <br />For reasons unknown, the company
            <br />has chosen now (and not a few weeks
            <br />back at NAB) to unleash its
            <br />prototype 4K and 8K camcorders,
            <br />both of which boast D-ILA
            <br />technology and can capture clips at a
            <br />downright mind-blowing 8,912 x
            <br />4,320 or 3,840 x 2,160 resolution.
            <br />There's also a more &quot;compact&quot;
            <br />sibling which does 4K only, but even
            <br />it provides plenty of pixels to zoom
            <br />and pan in unprecedented clarity on.
            <br />So JVC -- you, us, CEDIA 2009. It's
            <br />a date, cool?

            <br />  We don't see an official press
            <br />release yet but Pocket-lint and other
            <br />UK sites are claiming that Sony's
            <br />OLED Walkman will hit the UK high
            <br />streets starting tomorrow. The hotly
            <br />anticipated X-series Walkman will be
            <br />priced at 209 for the 16GB model or
            <br />279 for the 32GB model. We'd
            <br />translate those numbers to US dollars
            <br />but we don't want to scare the natives
            <br />with the UK markup for consumer
            <br />electronics. We'll update you with
            <br />official US numbers just as soon as
            <br />they're out.

            <br />  When &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; finale
            <br />begins tonight, the father-and-son
            <br />team of Ron and Mike Morelli, the
            <br />last team on the ranch with both of its
            <br />members, will find out which one of
            <br />them will compete against Tara Costa
            <br />and Helen Phillips for the $250,000
            <br />grand prize.
            <br />   Last week, despite impressive 10-
            <br />pound weight losses each, the guys
            <br />were pushed below the yellow line
            <br />by the two remaining women in the
            <br />competition. That means that Ron
            <br />and Mike's future is being decided by
            <br />America, who voted on which of the
            <br />two would get to move on.
            <br />  &quot;I'm okay with the fact that at least
            <br />one of us is there,&quot; Ron says. &quot;I mean
            <br />we're both going to be standing there
            <br />on that same stage. But Mike and I
            <br />are pretty competitive with each
            <br />other, and I wouldn't want to be up
            <br />against him in the top three.&quot;
            <br />  Remember the Nokia E71? It was
            <br />one awesome smartphone. Now that
            <br />a U.S. carrier (AT&amp;T) has decided to
            <br />offer up the device they've lowered
            <br />the price but sacrificed some of our
            <br />fave features.

            <br />  This post is part of Mashables
            <br />Spark of Genius series, which
            <br />highlights a unique feature of
            <br />startups. If you would like to have
            <br />your startup considered for inclusion,
            <br />please see the details here. The series
            <br />is made possible by Microsoft
            <br />BizSpark.
            <br />   Name: Goalkeeper
            <br />   Quick Pitch: Goalkeeper is a hosted
            <br />free online project management
            <br />application, team collaboration and
            <br />issue tracking software.
            <br />   Genius Idea: Online project
            <br />management is a big business, and
            <br />for good reason - Web technology
            <br />has made it far easier for companies
            <br />and organizations to collaborate and
            <br />manage projects and staff. And while
            <br />there are already some great tools out
            <br />there (i.e. Basecamp and
            <br />Freshbooks), a new startup,
            <br />Goalkeeper brings to the table a
            <br />simple interface with a lot of very
            <br />useful features for big companies and
            <br />freelancers alike.
            <br />   Goalkeeper is an all-encompassing
            <br />project management system. With it,
            <br />you can create new projects, chat
            <br />with your team, and even track
            <br />website issues. Goalkeeper didnt
            <br />skimp on the feature-set. The litany
            <br />of tasks you can perform include
            <br />creating support tickets, sharing files,
            <br />adjusting priorities, tracking project
            <br />progress, creating checklist, backing
            <br />up projects, customizing your
            <br />dashboard, and assigning tasks. And
            <br />all of that is just under the Projects
            <br />tab.
            <br />   For those who are familiar with
            <br />project management software, most
            <br />of these features are standard. So
            <br />where does Goalkeeper stand out?
            <br />The first area where I believe it
            <br />excels is in the interface - its very
            <br />easy to learn and places some of the
            <br />most important information in a very
            <br />useful right hand column. Theres
            <br />also a detailed help section if you
            <br />dont understand something.
            <br />   Another strong suit of Goalkeeper
            <br />is timeline and all of its calendar-
            <br />based features - theyre superb. It
            <br />was easy for me to navigate through
            <br />information on a specific month, day,
            <br />or week. The calendar widget in the
            <br />right hand column makes it easy to
            <br />jump to a specific day. It also comes
            <br />with overview modes and even a
            <br />gantt chart. Its perfect for when you
            <br />need a quick glance or a deep
            <br />drilldown.
            <br />   Goalkeeper also has an easy-to-use
            <br />web chat system and even budget
            <br />tracking for complex projects. The
            <br />price is fair too: $29 for a freelancer
            <br />account and $69 for a professional
            <br />account with a month-long free trial.
            <br />There are still a few bugs and quirks
            <br />in Goalkeeper, primarily that this
            <br />Serbia-based startup has awkward
            <br />English and could really use some
            <br />copy help from a fluent English
            <br />speaker (also goalkeeper, I suggest
            <br />you change your tagline).
            <br />   Still, this doesnt detract from
            <br />Goalkeepers functionality or
            <br />usefulness. Its another well-made
            <br />service for extensive project
            <br />management. Sponsored by

            <br />  Last week, Bravo hosted a virtual
            <br />viewing party for The Real
            <br />Housewives of New York season
            <br />finale, and they were desperate for
            <br />you to tweet them during this
            <br />interactive live stream that combined
            <br />Facebook Connect, Sign In with
            <br />Twitter, and mobile chat.
            <br />   Now that the drama has played out
            <br />on-air and the Web, we know that
            <br />their efforts prevailed. Overall the
            <br />campaign more than doubled Bravos
            <br />(@bravotv) Twitter follower count,
            <br />resulted in a huge spike in Twitter
            <br />mentions during the virtual viewing
            <br />party, and attracted record numbers
            <br />to Bravos website. Plus, as it turns
            <br />out, one of the housewives, Bethenny
            <br />(@Bethenny), was a trending topic
            <br />on Twitter during the season finale.
            <br />   Peaking at 2,089 tweets mentioning
            <br />bravotv on May 5th, Bravo may
            <br />not have achieved anywhere near the
            <br />same mindblowing numbers that
            <br />CNN pulled in during the
            <br />Inauguration, but its certainly
            <br />nothing to scoff at for a cable
            <br />program. Here are a few more
            <br />notable stats:
            <br />   1. 2,089 total tweets mentioning
            <br />bravotv on May 5th, and 2,906
            <br />total tweets from the 4th - 6th
            <br />   2. BravoTV increased their
            <br />follower count 121.18% (from 3,111
            <br />to 6,641) during the course of the
            <br />campaign
            <br />   3. The percentage of news stories
            <br />mentioning bravotv jumped 15%
            <br />during the period, with coverage now
            <br />up 55%
            <br />   4. BravoTV.com page views for the
            <br />finale exceeded 1 million and were
            <br />159% higher than normal, with 47%
            <br />more video streams than the previous
            <br />episode
            <br />   5. The Real Housewives of New
            <br />York site accounted for 66% of all
            <br />BravoTV.com traffic on finale day
            <br />   6. 40% of viewers participated via
            <br />Sign in with Twitter
            <br />   With these numbers, Bravos foray
            <br />into interactive live streaming of
            <br />traditional TV-only content isnt
            <br />likely to be their last. We can only
            <br />hope that more networks will start
            <br />experimenting with online broadcasts

            <br />only 11 months
            <br />   Obama wants to step up the hunt
            <br />for Bin Laden
            <br />   Barack Obama replaced his top
            <br />general in Afghanistan yesterday in
            <br />an attempt to turn round a war that
            <br />has been going badly for the US and
            <br />to step up the hunt for Osama bin
            <br />Laden.
            <br />   General David McKiernan, who
            <br />was in overall charge of the Nato-led
            <br />-mission and had been appointed for
            <br />18-24 months, lost the job after only
            <br />11 months.
            <br />   Taliban forces have been making
            <br />steady advances in Afghanistan, in a
            <br />war that the US thought it had won in
            <br />2001.
            <br />   The defence secretary, Robert
            <br />Gates, speaking at a Pentagon press
            <br />conference, indicated there was a
            <br />need for a less conventional
            <br />approach. McKiernan is to replaced
            <br />by Lieutenant General Stanley
            <br />McChrystal, a soldier who has
            <br />-specialised in unconventional
            <br />warfare, having spent most of his
            <br />career in the most secretive special
            <br />forces in the US. The sacking
            <br />effectively brings to an end
            <br />McKiernan's military career.
            <br />   Gates told reporters: &quot;Our mission
            <br />there requires new thinking and new
            <br />approaches by our military leaders.&quot;
            <br />Asked for a specific reason why
            <br />-McKiernan was being removed,
            <br />Gates said: &quot;Nothing went wrong and
            <br />there was nothing specific.&quot;
            <br />   McChrystal, who has been in
            <br />-overall charge of special forces in
            <br />Iraq, was responsible for the army's
            <br />Delta Force and led operations in
            <br />Iraq aimed at targeting particular
            <br />individuals, such as the one that
            <br />resulted in the killing of the al-Qaida
            <br />leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-
            <br />Zarqawi, in 2006.
            <br />   George Bush outed him at the time
            <br />by publicly praising him for hunting
            <br />down Zarqawi.
            <br />   McKiernan's approach to the
            <br />-worsening situation in Pakistan was
            <br />to ask for more US troops, saying he
            <br />needed at least 30,000 more troops
            <br />for what he warned was going to be a
            <br />tough 12 months.
            <br />   Obama gave him only two-thirds of
            <br />that, and this included troops who
            <br />would not have a combat role but
            <br />instead are to train Afghan forces.
            <br />   The Obama administration wants
            <br />different approaches in Afghanistan,
            <br />one that concentrates on building up
            <br />the Afghan army and police forces
            <br />and entering into deals with local
            <br />warlords or provincial leaders. At the
            <br />same time, it wants to try to win
            <br />hearts and minds with agricultural
            <br />and other economic developments.
            <br />   Gates touched on this yesterday,
            <br />saying that Afghanistan's problems
            <br />cannot be solved by military means
            <br />alone. But, in an apparent rebuke to
            <br />McKiernan, he added: &quot;And yet,
            <br />from the military perspective, we can
            <br />and must do better.&quot;
            <br />   Obama made a big play during the
            <br />presidential election campaign of
            <br />-capturing Bin Laden, who is
            <br />believed to be in hiding across the
            <br />border in Pakistan. US special forces
            <br />have crossed the border from
            <br />Afghanistan in the hunt for al-Qaida
            <br />suspects and the Obama
            <br />administration may have decided that
            <br />McChrystal, -having found Zarqawi,
            <br />might stand a better chance than
            <br />McKiernan.
            <br />   There was initial speculation that
            <br />McKiernan was taking the fall for a
            <br />US air raid in Farah province last
            <br />week in which more than 100
            <br />civilians were killed. But McKiernan,
            <br />who led US ground forces in the
            <br />2003 invasion of Iraq, was informed
            <br />by the Pentagon of his removal
            <br />several weeks before the air raid.
            <br />   The coming months are potentially
            <br />fraught for US and Nato forces as the
            <br />-Taliban in past years have used
            <br />spring and summer to mount their
            <br />offensives. The Afghanistan election
            <br />scheduled for this year gives them
            <br />even more of an incentive to create
            <br />chaos.
            <br />   McChrystal could turn out to be a
            <br />controversial choice. He faced a
            <br />Senate confirmation hearing last
            <br />year, with senators asking about
            <br />alleged mistreatment of detainees by
            <br />army rangers, navy seals and other
            <br />special operations troops in under his
            <br />command in Iraq and Afghanistan.
            <br />   In a statement issued yesterday,
            <br />-McKiernan said it had been an
            <br />honour to command forces in
            <br />Afghanistan, adding: &quot;I have never
            <br />been prouder to be an American
            <br />soldier&quot;.
            <br />   He said last year that the problem
            <br />posed by Afghanistan was tougher
            <br />than Iraq. He described Afghanistan
            <br />as &quot;a far more complex environment
            <br />than I ever found in Iraq&quot;.
            <br />   The country's mountainous terrain,
            <br />rural population, poverty, illiteracy,
            <br />400 tribal networks and history of
            <br />civil war all made for unique
            <br />challenges, he said.

            <br />to know back when it was
            <br />announced. When it got delayed, we
            <br />were bummed, but only a little,
            <br />because we knew we'd soon have it
            <br />in our hands. And now, it's finally
            <br />here.
            <br />   55 levels and 40 challenges of
            <br />some of the most addictive gameplay
            <br />there has ever been. Controls feature
            <br />a &quot;precision wheel&quot; on the side of the
            <br />screen that will let you line up your
            <br />shot perfectly. All of the Peggle
            <br />masters and powers in the regular
            <br />version made it to the iPhone as well.
            <br />If you've ever played Peggle, you
            <br />probably already know that at $4.99,
            <br />this is a steal, and if you've never
            <br />played Peggle, we can almost
            <br />assuredly tell you it's more than
            <br />worth the price (though there is a free
            <br />trial for the Mac just in case you're
            <br />not 100% sure).
            <br />   Peggle for the iPhone is out. Your

            <br />Free Blame the influence of friends; I
            <br />do. Because we couldn't get the Aqua
            <br />Teen Hunger Force movie to play
            <br />right, we ended up jumping into
            <br />Volume 2 of Squidbillies. Now I'd
            <br />seen part of one episode of this
            <br />(where Rusty makes his deal with the
            <br />devil), but I changed the channel. I'm
            <br />not sure why I resisted the Cuylers. I
            <br />love ATHF, so you'd think it would
            <br />be right up my alley, considering it's
            <br />by one of ATHF's creators. Hell, it
            <br />even features the voice of Master
            <br />Shake as Granny.
            <br />   Even when we first started
            <br />watching it last night, with Season 3,
            <br />Episode 1 I was reluctant to say I was
            <br />enjoying it. Eleven episodes later and
            <br />I was laughing out loud when Granny
            <br />was transformed with road kill skin
            <br />grafts and an udderly disgusting boob
            <br />job. It's a tradition in our house to
            <br />look at one another at the end of each
            <br />episode of ATHF and say &quot;what the
            <br />f**k did we just watch?!&quot;
            <br />Squidbillies gives me that same
            <br />feeling of ridiculous. Not to mention
            <br />the characters remind me of some of
            <br />the people who live in the small
            <br />Midwest town I find myself now.

            <br />  Dan Quayle played golf in Arizona.
            <br />Al Gore taught journalism in New
            <br />York. But Dick Cheney is breaking
            <br />with the tradition that former vice
            <br />presidents quietly leave Washington
            <br />and the public eye when they exit the
            <br />White House. Even Cheneys ex-
            <br />boss, George W. Bush, has refrained
            <br />from criticizing the Obama
            <br />administration, saying the new team
            <br />deserves his silence. But Cheney was
            <br />positively gabby on a Sunday talk
            <br />show.
            <br />   While many in official Washington
            <br />were recovering from Saturday
            <br />evenings White House
            <br />Correspondents Association dinner
            <br /> where President Barack Obama
            <br />got off some memorable one-liners
            <br />and comedian Wanda Sykes took aim
            <br />at radio talk jock Rush Limbaugh,
            <br />among others  Cheney gave a
            <br />lengthy interview to Face the
            <br />Nation on CBS television. The
            <br />replay of clips from that chat were
            <br />still reverberating on Mondays
            <br />morning shows on CNN, NBC and
            <br />ABC.
            <br />   On waterboarding terror suspects,
            <br />which critics say doesnt work in
            <br />getting useful information  aside
            <br />from it being torture  Cheney
            <br />disagreed. Khalid Shaikh
            <br />Mohammed  an evil, evil man
            <br />thats been in our custody since
            <br />March of 03  did not cooperate
            <br />fully in terms of interrogations until
            <br />after waterboarding. Once we went
            <br />through that process, he produced
            <br />vast quantities of invaluable
            <br />information about Al Qaeda.
            <br />   Any regrets about his time in the
            <br />White House? No regrets. I think it
            <br />was absolutely the right thing to do.
            <br />Im convinced, absolutely convinced,
            <br />that we saved thousands, perhaps
            <br />hundreds of thousands of lives.
            <br />   What about the detention center at
            <br />Guantanamo, which Obama has said
            <br />will be closed within a year? We
            <br />had to have a place, a facility, where
            <br />we could capture these people and
            <br />hold them until they were no longer a
            <br />danger to the United States  we
            <br />released hundreds already of the less
            <br />threatening types. About 12 percent
            <br />of them, nonetheless, went back onto
            <br />the fight as terrorists. The group
            <br />thats left, the 245 or so, these are the
            <br />worst of the worst.
            <br />   And what about Cheneys
            <br />Republican Party, now dealing with
            <br />the defection of high-profile Senator
            <br />Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania?
            <br />Should it move to the left to broaden
            <br />its appeal to voters? We are what we
            <br />are. Were Republicans  I think we
            <br />win elections when we have good
            <br />solid conservative principles to run
            <br />upon and base our policies on those
            <br />principles.
            <br />   If he had to choose between Rush
            <br />Limbaugh and Colin Powell  the
            <br />former Secretary of State and former
            <br />head of the military Joint Chiefs of
            <br />Staff  Cheney said hed pick
            <br />Limbaugh.
            <br />  Well, if I had to choose in terms of
            <br />being a Republican, Id go with Rush
            <br />Limbaugh, I think. I think my take on
            <br />it was Colin had already left the
            <br />party. I didnt know he was still a
            <br />Republican.
            <br />   Does any of this matter? After all,
            <br />Cheney is no longer in government.
            <br />You tell us: should Cheney continue
            <br />to speak out or does he owe the
            <br />Obama administration his silence in
            <br />its early months?

            <br />  After the Obama teams big
            <br />announcement on health care and an
            <br />even bigger deficit, now comes the
            <br />hard part  actually sitting down
            <br />and figuring out how much its going
            <br />to cost, and how to make it cost less.
            <br />President Barack Obamas first
            <br />public appearance today is a round-
            <br />table discussion with business leaders
            <br />on cutting employer health care
            <br />costs.
            <br />   Later, behind closed doors at the
            <br />White House, Obama and Vice
            <br />President Joe Biden meet with
            <br />Commanding General Raymond
            <br />Odierno, the head of the Multi-
            <br />National Force-Iraq, and U.S.
            <br />Ambassador to Iraq Chris Hill. Then
            <br />the president meets with Defense
            <br />Secretary Robert Gates, one day after
            <br />Gates replaced the top U.S.
            <br />Afghanistan commander.

            <br />questioning from the Senate

            <br />   Despite talk of early signs of
            <br />economic recovery, a U.S. Federal
            <br />Reserve official sounded a note of
            <br />caution. Things are better than they
            <br />were, but the crisis isnt over yet,
            <br />Atlanta Federal Reserve President
            <br />Dennis Lockhart said: I believe that
            <br />conditions are now calmer but it is
            <br />too soon to breathe easy.
            <br />   As if to confirm this, the U.S. trade
            <br />gap widened in March for the first
            <br />time in seven months  but not as
            <br />much as some analysts had feared.
            <br />So though the news isnt good, it
            <br />isnt as bad as it could be.
            <br />   Perhaps this counts as one of those
            <br />green shoots of economic recovery
            <br />we keep hearing about? You tell us:
            <br />is this a sign the economy is turning?

            <br />  D-Link has added CAPTCHA
            <br />confirmations to some of their
            <br />routers, ensuring that the entity trying
            <br />to log into your super router is a
            <br />human and not an animal or robot.
            <br />   For those not in the know,
            <br />CAPTCHA is essentially a challenge
            <br />-response test that separates robots
            <br />from humans. If youve ever seen
            <br />those squiggly graphics you
            <br />sometimes have to type in to confirm
            <br />a web-form submission, youve seen
            <br />a CAPTCHA. By adding CAPTCHA
            <br />D-Link ensures that automated
            <br />attacks on most routers are difficult -
            <br />but not impossible - for hackers to
            <br />carry out. CAPTCHA isnt 100%
            <br />secure, obviously, so this is a
            <br />deterrent not a preventative measure.

            <br />   Additional Safety Measure Helps
            <br />Defend Computers from
            <br />   Worms, Viruses and Other
            <br />Growing Security Threats
            <br />   FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif.,
            <br />May 12, 2009 - A series of recent
            <br />Internet security attacks on home and
            <br />small office computers are
            <br />compromising networks where users
            <br />least expect it - their routers. These
            <br />malicious software invasions, in
            <br />which users unknowingly download
            <br />a Trojan horse when performing
            <br />common tasks, invade the router to
            <br />detect wireless capabilities, then alter
            <br />the victims domain name system
            <br />(DNS) records so that all future
            <br />traffic is diverted through the,
            <br />attackers network first.
            <br />   In response to the growing number
            <br />of these attacks and subsequent user
            <br />security concerns, D-Link has
            <br />integrated CAPTCHA - a system,
            <br />designed to detect whether responses
            <br />are human or computer-generated -
            <br />into its popular home and small
            <br />office routers as an extra safety
            <br />measure. CAPTCHAs are used to
            <br />prevent malicious software from
            <br />performing actions that degrade the
            <br />quality of service on a network, such
            <br />as those found in worms, viruses and
            <br />Trojan horses.
            <br />   The term CAPTCHA is an
            <br />acronym for Completely Automated
            <br />Public Turing test to tell Computers
            <br />and Humans Apart. CAPTCHA is a
            <br />type of challenge-response test used
            <br />in computing to ensure that responses
            <br />are generated by humans, not
            <br />computers. A common type of
            <br />CAPTCHA requires the user to type
            <br />letters or numbers from a distorted
            <br />image that appears on the screen.
            <br />  Unlike other brands, the majority
            <br />of D-Link routers are not as easy to
            <br />be compromised since our design is
            <br />proprietary. However, were excited
            <br />to be the first in the market to
            <br />announce we have taken the initiative
            <br />to implement CAPTCHA into our
            <br />routers, thus providing yet another
            <br />layer of security to our customers,
            <br />said AJ Wang, chief technology
            <br />officer of D-Link.
            <br />   Popular D-Link router models that
            <br />now feature CAPTCHA include the
            <br />DIR-615, DIR-625, DIR-628, DIR-
            <br />655, DIR-825, DIR-855, DIR-685,
            <br />and DGL-4500. To upgrade routers
            <br />with CAPTCHA, customers need to
            <br />visit support.dlink.com to download
            <br />the upgrade.
            <br />  Those little scamps over at Adafruit
            <br />are always up to something. This
            <br />time they built a pager scanner
            <br />which is basically a system that grabs
            <br />all of the pages transmitted on pager
            <br />networks and displays them. Sadly,
            <br />the pager network isnt as juicy as it
            <br />used to be and now only doles out
            <br />sports scores and emergency
            <br />broadcasts.
            <br />   Whats that you say? What if,
            <br />during my day-to-day, activities,
            <br />these haX0rs try to steal my pages?
            <br />Well, remember, if youre still using
            <br />a pager youre either a doctor or a
            <br />drug dealer stuck in 1992 so you
            <br />either dont care if someone sees
            <br />your pages or you deserve to be
            <br />snooped upon.
            <br />   One concern: the video is pretty
            <br />darn obtuse so unless you know what
            <br />bit banging is, Id avoid giving this
            <br />a try. Still, they give you the full
            <br />breadboard diagram and a bit of
            <br />background so you can try this trick
            <br />yourself.

            <br />  Ryan Zimmerman is halfway to
            <br />history, according to a headline
            <br />Sunday on MLB.com  the
            <br />Washington Nationals third baseman
            <br />has hit safely in 28 straight games,
            <br />half the total of Joe DiMaggios
            <br />record 56-game hitting streak. But
            <br />Zimmerman is far from halfway
            <br />assured of tying DiMaggio; hes only
            <br />about a 50-50 bet to even reach 32
            <br />games, at least by my admittedly
            <br />simplistic estimate. Getty Images
            <br />   Ryan Zimmerman has a ways to go
            <br />to achieve a streak as rare as Royals
            <br />pitcher Zack Greinkes.
            <br />   Lets assume Zimmermans chance
            <br />of getting a hit in any given at bat is
            <br />34.6%, since hes hitting .346 this
            <br />season; thats a generous assumption
            <br />because his career average is .286.
            <br />Lets also assume he continues his
            <br />pace of 4.33 at-bats per game. Then
            <br />his average chance of getting a hit in
            <br />a game is about 84%. Getting hits in
            <br />four straight games, then, is a 50%
            <br />proposition. And stringing together
            <br />seven such four-game streaks from
            <br />here is a 1-in-127 long shot. This is
            <br />also generous because it doesnt
            <br />account for certain games where he
            <br />might face a particularly tough
            <br />pitcher or get walked repeatedly.
            <br />   Another way of looking at how
            <br />unlikely it is that Zimmerman will
            <br />match the record: Some 42 players
            <br />other than Joe DiMaggio have
            <br />amassed hitting streaks of 30 games
            <br />or more. None besides DiMaggio
            <br />even reached 46 games.
            <br />   How has Zimmerman even made it
            <br />this far? In part by getting lucky. On
            <br />Baseball Daily Digest, Jeff Lubbers
            <br />points out that Zimmerman is getting
            <br />hits on 39.4% of the balls he puts
            <br />into play. While batters have some
            <br />control over this statistic  hitting
            <br />more line drives than weak ground
            <br />balls helps  Zimmermans average
            <br />on batted balls in three prior full
            <br />major-league seasons has never
            <br />exceeded .329.
            <br />   Joe DiMaggios brother Dom, who
            <br />died Friday at age 92, knew
            <br />something about the role of luck in
            <br />hitting streaks. In 1949 he amassed a
            <br />34-game hitting streak that was
            <br />stopped on a day when he was hitting
            <br />the ball well; his brother, Joe, caught
            <br />his final attempt, a well-hit line drive
            <br />that Dom recalledwouldnt drop.
            <br />   Hitting streaks dont always signify
            <br />great seasons. The year Dom
            <br />DiMaggio hit in 34 straight games,
            <br />he finished the year with a good but
            <br />not outstanding .307 batting average.
            <br />His teammate, Ted Williams, hit .343
            <br />but couldnt match the hitting streak
            <br />of his teammate, in part because he
            <br />walked so often. (Williamss longest
            <br />hitting streak, despite his career
            <br />batting average of .344, was just 23
            <br />games.) Adam Dunn is no Ted
            <br />Williams, but Zimmermans
            <br />Nationals teammate has had a better
            <br />season despite never hitting safely in
            <br />more than five straight games, his
            <br />current streak. Dunn, like Williams
            <br />before him, walks a lot, and doesnt
            <br />always get credit for that.
            <br />   The most amazing streak in
            <br />baseball this season isnt
            <br />Zimmermans  not yet, anyway.
            <br />That honor belongs to Zack Greinke,
            <br />who held opposing batters scoreless
            <br />over 38 straight innings. Though that
            <br />feat was 20 innings shy of Don
            <br />Drysdales 1968 record of 58
            <br />innings, it was just as improbable
            <br />because more runs are being scored
            <br />in an average game today, according
            <br />to Sky Andrecheck of Baseball
            <br />Analysts. (In a follow-up article,
            <br />Andrecheck identified three other
            <br />scoreless streaks more improbable
            <br />than Greinkes and Drysdales,
            <br />including Orel Hershisers record 59-
            <br />inning streak.)
            <br />  Derrick Rose seemed to validate the
            <br />Chicago Bulls decision to draft him
            <br />with the first pick this year, leading
            <br />all rookies in assists, finishing second
            <br />in scoring, leading the Bulls to the
            <br />seventh game of their first-round
            <br />series against the defending
            <br />champion Boston Celtics  and
            <br />winning the NBA Rookie of the Year
            <br />award. But David J. Berri, an
            <br />economist at Southern Utah
            <br />University and NBA stats pundit,
            <br />says Rose was far from the leagues
            <br />best rookie. In fact, he was
            <br />essentially an average point guard.
            <br />Getty Images
            <br />   Did Kevin Love deserve the
            <br />Rookie of the Year award?
            <br />   Berri bases his analysis on a
            <br />statistic called wins produced, which
            <br />incorporates all major numbers from
            <br />the box score. Rose was near average
            <br />among NBA points guards in most
            <br />measures  slightly better in that he
            <br />scored more points and committed
            <br />fewer fouls, slightly worse in assists
            <br />and notably worse in steals. In sum,
            <br />all these numbers tell us that Rose
            <br />was essentially little better than an
            <br />average player in 2008-09, Berri
            <br />blogs. And this is because he really
            <br />didnt do anything exceptionally
            <br />well. Four rookies were more
            <br />productive: Kevin Love, Brook
            <br />Lopez, Marc Gasol and Mario
            <br />Chalmers.
            <br />   So why did Rose win? Berri
            <br />suspects it has a lot to do with his
            <br />draft position, the success of his team
            <br />and his points scored. To test this
            <br />hypothesis, he analyzed 62 Rookie of
            <br />the Year candidates who received
            <br />some consideration over the last
            <br />seven seasons, and produced a model
            <br />that predicted voting points based on
            <br />these criteria that favored Rose, plus
            <br />number of games played and market
            <br />size. Points scored per game, team
            <br />wins, and draft position are all
            <br />statistically linked to voting points,
            <br />with points scored having the largest
            <br />impact, Berri writes. In addition,
            <br />games played also matters. Market
            <br />size, though, was not statistically
            <br />significant.
            <br />   Then Berri goes a step further,
            <br />adding to his model the other box
            <br />score stats that he feels get no
            <br />respect. And hes right. His first
            <br />model correctly predicts 75% of the
            <br />difference in vote totals between
            <br />candidates. Add in assists, steals and
            <br />the rest, and you get a model that
            <br />predicts  75% of voting variation.
            <br />This, it turns out, is consistent with a
            <br />similar test of how coaches vote for
            <br />the All-Rookie team.
            <br />   Of course, Berris wins-produced
            <br />stat doesnt directly incorporate team
            <br />wins, a more conventional measure
            <br />that favors Rose and is prioritized by
            <br />many voters. The Bulls won eight
            <br />more games with their new point
            <br />guard than they did last year, while
            <br />Loves Timberwolves improved their
            <br />record by only two wins.
            <br />   Lest you think Berris system is
            <br />biased against point guards, consider
            <br />that it attributes more wins to Chris
            <br />Paul than to Most Valuable Player
            <br />LeBron James. Paul should, at
            <br />minimum, have gotten a few more
            <br />MVP votes, according to Berris
            <br />stats.

            <br />appetite for literature. All the menus
            <br />read themselves off when you mouse
            <br />over them, and they have keyboard
            <br />shortcuts, which is useful if you have
            <br />reduced vision. Jill is pretty good at
            <br />recognizing words. We tried out

            <br />   Apple's newest Shuffle (almost 50
            <br />percent smaller than previous
            <br />Shuffles) could easily be mistaken
            <br />for a stick of Trident, features no
            <br />buttons, and pimps voice-
            <br />identification technology. But even
            <br />given its apparent readily
            <br />consumable stature, there are a few
            <br />features on the Shuffle that are a bit
            <br />tough to swallow.
            <br />   The biggest gripe on the 4-GB
            <br />Shuffle we tested is definitely the
            <br />control set. First off, it's completely
            <br />counterintuitive; Apple says you can
            <br />easily use it without looking. We still
            <br />don't have the hang of it after a few
            <br />days of testing. What's worse, if you
            <br />have a decent set of earbuds (say, a
            <br />pair of Shures or Ultimate Ears)
            <br />you're totally hosed  you'll have to
            <br />endure the 'buds that come with the

            <br />   Rather than foam, gel or
            <br />compressed-air cushioning, the soles
            <br />on Newtons have a series of &quot;actuator
            <br />lugs&quot; just below the ball of the foot.
            <br />The lugs are designed to help
            <br />encourage you to land on your
            <br />forefoot, to protect that part of the
            <br />foot, and (best yet) to propel you
            <br />forward. When you land, the lugs
            <br />push into hollow chambers in the
            <br />midsole. This cushions your landing,
            <br />and helps make it comfy to land
            <br />midsole or forefoot rather than on the
            <br />heel as you might be accustomed. As
            <br />your foot moves forward, these lugs
            <br />then essentially lever out, and as you
            <br />lift your foot, they return the energy
            <br />by pushing up and out in the same
            <br />direction as your stride. Newton
            <br />claims this makes them more
            <br />efficient than traditional foam or gel
            <br />soles that simply absorb energy but
            <br />don't return it.

            <br />   The Firebird features a hybrid
            <br />design  using 2.5-inch hard drives
            <br />(two 320-GB models) and dual
            <br />graphics cards originally designed for
            <br />laptops  but powers it all with a
            <br />desktop CPU and desktop-sized

            <br />built in, but the power supply is not:
            <br />To save on wattage, HP breaks out
            <br />the (enormous) power adapter instead
            <br />of integrating it into the box.
            <br />   As cool as the Firebird is on the
            <br />whole, it isn't without some foibles.
            <br />The inclusion of an ExpressCard slot
            <br />is on the baffling-to-useless side, and
            <br />the external power supply (it's huge)
            <br />is more annoying to deal with than it
            <br />sounds. But our biggest gripe is that
            <br />the Firebird's streamlined shell means

            <br />   After dividing up 16 &quot;regular
            <br />caffeine users&quot; (sounds so clinical!)
            <br />into two groups, researchers gave
            <br />half of them the equivalent of 20
            <br />ounces of strong coffee per day,
            <br />while the other half thought they
            <br />were getting the same fix. The big
            <br />reveal is that everyone, getting real
            <br />caffeine or fake, saw their brain
            <br />getting more blood flow and activity,
            <br />and the placebo crew felt just as
            <br />awake or tired throughout the day as
            <br />their temporarily lucky counterparts.
            <br />   Unfortunately, the placebo takers
            <br />also had unmistakable headaches
            <br />and, temporarily, occasional
            <br />decreases in alertness or energy.
            <br />Once a heavy caffeine dependent got
            <br />past their withdrawal symptoms,
            <br />however, it appears their brain was
            <br />happy to keep up the illusion that a
            <br />caffeine-free beverage break at 3
            <br />p.m. was just as good as the real
            <br />thing. Update: As a few commenters
            <br />point out (some more helpfully than
            <br />others), actual placebos are only as
            <br />effective as the illusion that they're
            <br />the real thing, or just something
            <br />helpful. So perhaps this is a trick best
            <br />employed with a friend's sneaky help,
            <br />or by keeping yourself distracted
            <br />enough with something else that the
            <br />mere action of raising a mug to your
            <br />lips activates your Caffeine Equals
            <br />Waking Up impulses.

            <br />a Golden Arches, Rich-and-Creamy-
            <br />Blended-Beverage kind of way. Then
            <br />there's sugar, which is ever-present in
            <br />modern grocery staples. Sugar Stacks
            <br />illustrates this sucrose subterfuge
            <br />using sugar cube illustrations.

            <br />section site, with snacks, breakfast
            <br />foods, beverages, and other food
            <br />categories listed with serving sizes,
            <br />calories, and calories from sugar. But
            <br />it's the equivalent sugar cubes
            <br />stacked next to each food that get

            <br />&quot;Yeah, it's organic sugar, but it's still
            <br />as much as your average kid's
            <br />cereal.&quot;
            <br />   Sugar is, of course, just one
            <br />element of diet and health, and by no
            <br />means an entirely unhealthy thing to
            <br />eat. But knowing how to avoid sugar
            <br />where you don't expect it is a nice
            <br />way to get any diet moving back
            <br />toward health and stability.

            <br />drive and ports galore (three USB
            <br />and an HDMI)? You betcha! Best of
            <br />all, with its fetching brushed
            <br />aluminum chassis, no one will
            <br />mistake this for a budget notebook.

            <br />has all the telltale signs of some
            <br />obvious corner cutting. Forget about

            <br />integrated GMA 4500MHD graphics
            <br />card, even moderately intensive titles
            <br />won't run properly. But our main
            <br />beef with the UC7807u is the feeble
            <br />6-cell battery which clocked in at a
            <br />disappointing 3 hours, 25 minutes

            <br />   It's no wonder this watch ran away
            <br />with my heart; for the competitive
            <br />runner or multisport athlete seeking a
            <br />personal best in 2009, the Polar
            <br />RS800CX is the required training
            <br />device. Because of incredibly robust
            <br />desktop software, tracking of obscure
            <br />performance metrics, and a wide
            <br />variety of add-on sensors, the
            <br />RS800CX can help you measure,
            <br />analyze and improve nearly every
            <br />aspect of your training program.
            <br />   WIRED Offers better heart-rate

            <br />from in-watch display, to software
            <br />interface, to training programs. GPS
            <br />and barometric altimeter combined
            <br />with location tracking mean you'll
            <br />never wonder where you wandered.

            <br />   The pocket rocket we've been
            <br />packing in our pants recently (full
            <br />name: Optoma DLP EP-PK-101 Pico
            <br />Pocket Projector) is one of the first
            <br />mini projectors to hit the market. It's
            <br />also one of the best, even though a
            <br />number of flaws spill from the tiny
            <br />device.
            <br />   Styled like a '40s-era Zippo, the
            <br />piano-black portable feels more
            <br />natural in the hand than a lot of
            <br />cellphones. But it's not size that
            <br />matters to us, it's the video
            <br />components! The projector is
            <br />comprised of a combo-rig LED lamp
            <br />and a DLP chip (courtesy of Texas
            <br />Instruments) that sets the resolution
            <br />at 480 x 320 pixels with a range
            <br />output of 9 lumens. Yes, we know
            <br />this is low compared to full-bodied
            <br />projectors like Benq's gargantuan
            <br />MP512 ST 2500-lumen projector but
            <br />for something this small, it's
            <br />remarkable.
            <br />   WIRED Perfect projector for
            <br />parties. Rectangular lens creates wide
            <br />image that keeps the image from
            <br />stretching. Fine picture quality, 8-96
            <br />inches. Startup time &gt; 4 seconds.
            <br />Dead-sexy hardware.
            <br />   TIRED Lithium-ion batteries die

            <br />  Whoa heavy and a bottle of bread!
            <br />Corsair just released a 256GB SSD
            <br />SATA II 3.0Gbps drive for $660
            <br />*head spins like wolf in cartoons that
            <br />has just been clobbered by a mallet*.
            <br />   Thats right. This bugger is$658.22
            <br />at NCIX and is in stock. For
            <br />something a little more sane you can
            <br />rock their 128GB drive for $299 but
            <br />who wants to go all chintzy when
            <br />were talking a lump of storage so
            <br />dense that matter falls into it when
            <br />you pass by.
            <br />   Advanced Controller and Drive
            <br />Technologies Deliver Industry-
            <br />Leading Performance and
            <br />Compatibility
            <br />   Fremont, CA, May 11th, 2009 
            <br />Corsair www.corsair.com, a
            <br />worldwide leader in high-
            <br />performance computer and flash
            <br />memory products, today announced
            <br />the launch of the Corsair Storage
            <br />Solutions P256 high-performance
            <br />256GB solid-state drive (SSD).
            <br />   The Corsair Storage Solutions
            <br />P256 has been designed using cutting
            <br />-edge technology to deliver the
            <br />highest performance and
            <br />compatibility, in a capacity that is big
            <br />enough to replace conventional
            <br />storage solutions in a high-
            <br />performance PC. The P256 uses
            <br />specially selected Samsung MLC
            <br />flash memory and a sophisticated
            <br />Samsung Controller IC, coupled with
            <br />128MB of super-fast cache memory
            <br />and Native Command Queuing
            <br />(NCQ) support for blistering, stutter-
            <br />free performance, delivering read
            <br />speeds of up to 220MB/sec and write
            <br />speeds of up to 200MB/sec.
            <br />  The Corsair Storage Solutions
            <br />P256 delivers the best computing
            <br />experience of any single storage
            <br />drive available today, said John
            <br />Beekley, VP of Applications
            <br />Engineering at Corsair, Using the
            <br />P256 results in immediate and
            <br />dramatic improvements in system
            <br />startup and shutdown, game level
            <br />loading, application startup, and
            <br />many other everyday tasks.
            <br />Additionally, the P256 is more
            <br />durable and reliable than hard disk
            <br />drives, and has been shown in the
            <br />Corsair Labs to provide up to 25%
            <br />longer battery life in portable
            <br />computers.
            <br />   The large, 256GB capacity
            <br />provides ample space for the most
            <br />advanced operating systems, multiple
            <br />applications, and large music, photo
            <br />and video collections. The Corsair
            <br />Storage Solutions P256 is one of the
            <br />most compatible solid-state drives
            <br />available today due to the extensive
            <br />validation of the Samsung controller
            <br />and flash memory technology in
            <br />multiple OEM systems.
            <br />   The Corsair Storage Solutions
            <br />P256 SSD is available immediately
            <br />from Corsairs authorized
            <br />distributors and resellers worldwide,
            <br />and is backed by a Two Year Limited
            <br />Warranty. Complete customer
            <br />support via telephone, email, forum

            <br />  TokyoFlash is giving away a watch
            <br />to three winners of their TokyoFlash
            <br />landmark contest. The rules are
            <br />pretty simple: simply create an image
            <br />of a famous horological landmarks
            <br />redesigned with TokyoFlash faces
            <br />i.e. Big Ben with the Rogue face
            <br />built-in.
            <br />   Get creative and submit your own
            <br />ideas for a new landmark clock to
            <br />clocks@tokyoflash.com for the
            <br />chance to win the watch of your
            <br />choice from Tokyoflash!
            <br />   You can send an image,
            <br />description, news story or
            <br />combination, but please keep it to
            <br />less than 500 words. You can use
            <br />your own way of telling the time or
            <br />use the display from any of our
            <br />watches.
            <br />   How To Enter:
            <br />   1. Email your enty of a famous
            <br />landmark that has a Tokyoflash way
            <br />of reading the time to
            <br />clocks@tokyoflash.com
            <br />   2. Closing date is 26th May 2009
            <br />when three winners will be chosen to
            <br />win a watch from Tokyoflash.
            <br />   3. Winners will be able to select a
            <br />watch of their choice.
            <br />   4. You may submit as many entries
            <br />as you wish.
            <br />  Not much detail here, but some
            <br />creative soul squeezed a Fender amp
            <br />into an old cigar box. Although not
            <br />entirely practical, its a fine example
            <br />of a good way to re-use something
            <br />youd otherwise discard. Remember,
            <br />re-use is better then recycling; and
            <br />reduction in consumption is better
            <br />than both!
            <br />   And here I was feeling clever about
            <br />cutting a 55-gallon drum in half to
            <br />use as my fire pit.

            <br />   It's not as hard as you might think.

            <br />Facebook groups, there are a variety
            <br />of ways to connect with &quot;Star Trek&quot;

            <br />   Star-Trek If you're a Twitter
            <br />fanatic, the Tweetworks Star-Trek
            <br />group might be worth checking out.
            <br />It's not a vibrant community--there
            <br />are just a few dozen members--but
            <br />it's the largest &quot;Star Trek&quot; Twitter
            <br />group on the Tweetworks network.
            <br />You'll find other Twitter users to
            <br />communicate with. And you can
            <br />leave as many tweets as you want
            <br />about the movie. But until it grows,
            <br />consider it your last destination.
            <br />  &quot;Star Trek&quot; Facebook group The
            <br />&quot;Star Trek&quot; Facebook group is the

            <br />has over 2,400 members. Its
            <br />discussion board is brimming with
            <br />messages about topics ranging from

            <br />features the movie's newest trailer.
            <br />And if you want to see scenes from
            <br />the film, it has a couple clips for you
            <br />to watch. But it's the page's forums
            <br />that will keep you coming back.
            <br />More than 22,000 &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans
            <br />are currently discussing the movie,
            <br />the franchise, and everything in

            <br />Night Live&quot; skits to scenes from the
            <br />original show. The TrekSpace forum
            <br />is the site's best feature. It's filled
            <br />with discussions about the &quot;Star
            <br />Trek&quot; storyline, information about
            <br />individual shows, and much more. I
            <br />spent an hour on the site just reading
            <br />through the various threads. If you're
            <br />a real &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, and you want
            <br />to connect with others, TrekSpace is
            <br />a great place to do it.
            <br />   TrekUnited TrekUnited was
            <br />originally formed to save &quot;Star Trek:
            <br />Enterprise&quot; from cancellation. It
            <br />didn't work. Since then, it has grown
            <br />into one of the largest &quot;Star Trek&quot;
            <br />sites on the Web. Besides &quot;Star Trek&quot;
            <br />news, the site provides up-to-date
            <br />information on upcoming
            <br />conventions. But with more than
            <br />4,000 members, the site's community
            <br />is second to none. You can chat with
            <br />others or engage them in discussion
            <br />in the site's forums. Those forums are
            <br />some of the most active of any &quot;Star
            <br />Trek&quot; thread on the Web. You'll
            <br />definitely spend some time in there.
            <br />Check out TrekUnited. I think that
            <br />you'll like what you see.

            <br />   A brand-new BlackBerry app
            <br />joined the Evernote family on
            <br />Monday. The multiplatform,
            <br />multimedia note-taking service has
            <br />already been uploading voice, text,
            <br />images, and files from the desktop (
            <br />Mac| Windows), Web, Windows
            <br />Mobile phones, and the iPhone. The
            <br />addition of BlackBerry rounds out
            <br />Evernote's presence on major
            <br />smartphone operating systems,
            <br />though it's likely that if the Palm Pre
            <br />takes off, the company will continue
            <br />development for Palm's Web OS.
            <br />   Like Evernote on other mobile
            <br />platforms, Evernote for BlackBerry
            <br />(download) lets you upload a text
            <br />note, voice clip, picture, or file to
            <br />your cloud-based Evernote account.
            <br />The signature green interface is
            <br />clean, and quick and easy to navigate
            <br />on the BlackBerry Bold, my test
            <br />device. Simply scroll with the track
            <br />ball to move through the four
            <br />notetaking icons on the start screen,
            <br />or pop down to the bottom to search
            <br />a note by its tag. Pressing the Menu
            <br />key reveals options to view recently-
            <br />created notes, notes pending
            <br />uploading, and an option to activate
            <br />GPS.
            <br />   The application's performance
            <br />depends heavily on how strong your
            <br />data connection is. On a weak data or
            <br />Wi-Fi network, loading your history
            <br />of notes could test your patience, but
            <br />on a fast connection, the notes you
            <br />took on the desktop or Web are easy
            <br />enough to browse or search by tag.
            <br />We should note that the method for
            <br />playing back voice notes requires
            <br />you to download or open the
            <br />captured voice file on the
            <br />BlackBerry's media player--too bad
            <br />there's no direct method to bring the
            <br />player's functionality into Evernote
            <br />itself. However, the app also includes
            <br />some keyboard-skirting shortcuts that
            <br />let you populate the descriptions area
            <br />of an upload with previously-used
            <br />tags.
            <br />   Evernote for BlackBerry is a
            <br />freemium product; the core capturing
            <br />and search features are free, but
            <br />subscriptions for storing multimedia
            <br />notes online beyond the first 40MB
            <br />per month sell for $5 per month (or
            <br />$45 per year.) The application is
            <br />compatible with the Bold, Storm, and
            <br />Curve 8900 series phones, and
            <br />should also work on future phones
            <br />running operating systems 4.6 and
            <br />higher. As of today, Evernote for
            <br />BlackBerry is exclusively available
            <br />through the BlackBerry App World
            <br />application.
            <br />  The Minnesota Supreme Court
            <br />orders the disclosure of the computer
            <br />code operating the state's drunken-
            <br />driving breath-testing machines. Still,
            <br />even if flaws in the code are found, it
            <br />is unlikely that thousands of DUI
            <br />convictions will be overturned.

            <br />  Super Bit Mapping for Video
            <br />(SBMV) is the new secret sauce
            <br />Sony thinks will enhance the Bluray
            <br />experience, allowing for superior
            <br />color gradation quality. The company
            <br />announced the first Bluray disc for
            <br />the Japanese market today[JP] that
            <br />makes use of the new technology.
            <br />   Sony chose the anime title
            <br />EVANGELION1.11 YOU ARE
            <br />(NOT) ALONE for the SBMV
            <br />debut and also shows the screenshots
            <br />you see above in their press release.
            <br />The problem is I hardly see a
            <br />difference, but maybe thats just me
            <br />(the top row shows two screengrabs
            <br />using SBMV, while SBMV is not
            <br />used for the two on the bottom).
            <br />   The disc goes on sale in Japan on
            <br />May 27 for $60 (you need to own a
            <br />SBMV compatible Sony Bluray
            <br />player that accepts Japanese discs).
            <br />   Japanese tech news site AV Watch
            <br />has more screenshots. The site is
            <br />Japanese but you can compare the
            <br />screenshots made with SBMV on the
            <br />right hand side with screenshots
            <br />made without using SBMV on the
            <br />left.
            <br />  Newsflash: people love Guitar Hero
            <br />and Rock Band. You can tell because
            <br />Logitech makes a $200 guitar
            <br />controller thats currently
            <br />backordered 2 to 4 weeks.
            <br />   Gizmodo spent a little quality time
            <br />with the aforementioned wireless
            <br />PS2/PS3 controller and said that the
            <br />all-wood guitar is definitely solid
            <br />and that the weight of it was
            <br />comparable to an actual guitar.
            <br />   The controller touts hundreds of
            <br />hours of battery life and virtually
            <br />silent fret buttons and strum bar. It
            <br />looks nice, too, if you can get past
            <br />the goofy colored buttons. I like
            <br />Guitar Hero and Rock Band as much
            <br />as anyone but if Im gonna throw
            <br />down for some big boy instruments, I
            <br />think Id pony up an extra $100 for
            <br />the Ion drum set instead.

            <br />  Say hello to the Dell Mini 10v. Its
            <br />an awful lot like the Dell Mini 10
            <br />except that it uses an Intel Atom
            <br />N270 CPU at 1.6GHz instead of an
            <br />Intel Atom Z520 or Z530 CPU at
            <br />1.33GHz or 1.6GHz, repectively.
            <br />Wait, theres more!
            <br />   The Mini 10v manages to shave off
            <br />a few ounces of weight somehow,
            <br />starting at 2.5 pounds versus the Mini
            <br />10s 2.8-ish pound starting weight.
            <br />And the 10vs starting price is $299
            <br />as opposed to the Mini 10s $399
            <br />starting price.
            <br />   Unlike the Dell Mini 10, the 10v is
            <br />only available with a 1024576
            <br />display. The Dell 10 offers a $35
            <br />upgrade to a 1366768 screen, which
            <br />is a downright steal if you ask me.

            <br />  Ever since the mid-'60s, when
            <br />thousands of bored and/or hopped-up
            <br />Beatles fans wore out their needles
            <br />playing Revolver backward, music
            <br />fans have searched recordings for
            <br />hidden messages. Often, the findings
            <br />reflect nothing more than enhanced
            <br />imaginations: If you really hear
            <br />Robert Plant pledging his devotion to
            <br />Satan on &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; you
            <br />may need to cut down on the hot-
            <br />knifing. But plenty of real missives
            <br />are embedded in your favorite
            <br />albums and videos. Can you dig 'em?
            <br />   1967 The 3-D lenticular album art
            <br />on the Rolling Stones' Their Satanic
            <br />Majesties Request contains tucked-
            <br />away images of the Beatles.
            <br />   1970 Vinyl pressings of Led
            <br />Zeppelin III are discreetly inscribed
            <br />with quotes from British occultist
            <br />and &quot;sex magick&quot; hedonist Aleister
            <br />Crowley.
            <br />   1971 The liner notes on Violet
            <br />Sedan Chair's album Seven Suns list
            <br />a missing 11th song, and the
            <br />penultimate track is rumored to
            <br />produce hallucinatory effects when
            <br />played on multiple turntables.
            <br />   1984 On Purple Rain's &quot;Darling
            <br />Nikki,&quot; Prince closes with gibberish
            <br />that, when played backward, sounds
            <br />like &quot;Hello, how are you? I'm fine,
            <br />'cause I know that the Lord is coming
            <br />soon.&quot;
            <br />   1991 Nirvana buries an unlisted
            <br />song, &quot;Endless, Nameless,&quot; 13
            <br />minutes after the finale of
            <br />Nevermind; hidden tracks soon
            <br />become a staple of '90s alt-rock.
            <br />   2000 A booklet concealed under
            <br />the CD tray of Radiohead's Kid A
            <br />contains images of gun-toting teddy
            <br />bears, fanged monsters, and a
            <br />demonic-looking Tony Blair.
            <br />   2000 What appears to be an airport
            <br />sign (J33-3) on the cover of U2's All
            <br />That You Can't Leave Behind is a
            <br />biblical reference to Jeremiah 33:3.
            <br />   2005 Beck pays homage to Mad
            <br />magazine's Al Jaffee by sneaking his
            <br />name onto a TV screen in the &quot;Girl&quot;
            <br />video.
            <br />   2006 Tupac Shakur fans claim to
            <br />hear the message &quot;Yes, you'll see me,
            <br />I'll be back&quot; back-masked on the
            <br />posthumous release Pac's Life.
            <br />   2008 Coldplay includes two
            <br />&quot;hidden&quot; tracks on Viva la Vidabut
            <br />then reveals the names of the songs
            <br />online, ruining the surprise.
            <br />  Right now, its relatively easy to
            <br />create a Twitter trending topic (see
            <br />them at search.twitter.com).
            <br />Example: start a game, get a couple
            <br />of friends to join in, and if it catches
            <br />on, youve got yourself a trend.
            <br />Unfortunately, this also means that
            <br />its easy to manipulate the trending
            <br />topics for purposes of spam or even
            <br />worse.
            <br />   Currently, theres a trending topic
            <br />called #TwitterPornNames. Its
            <br />supposed to be a game to pass the
            <br />time, but according to PC World, its
            <br />   nothing more then a disguise to
            <br />get users to publicly post answers to
            <br />their online security questions. The
            <br />current game has a few variations
            <br />you take the name of your first pet
            <br />combine it with the street you grew
            <br />up on or your mothers maiden name.
            <br />All of these are common security
            <br />questions to access your online
            <br />accounts and bank information.
            <br />   Sounds like a miserable attempt at
            <br />a scam, but the topic is popular, so
            <br />maybe someone is buying into it.
            <br />Dont.
            <br />   There is, however, another take on
            <br />the origins of this topic. According to
            <br />WhatTheTrend, its a
            <br />  scam was started by PC World
            <br />so they could write a story and get
            <br />money from adsense payments when
            <br />you clicked on the link
            <br />   Now, I sincerely doubt the latter is
            <br />the case. But Im pointing out both
            <br />explanations to show how confusing
            <br />trending topics can be; especially for
            <br />the casual Twitter user. Without even
            <br />going into whos scamming who, the
            <br />fact is that Twitters trending topics
            <br />are currently easy to manipulate, and
            <br />that Twitter needs to do something
            <br />about it before they become too
            <br />spammy/scammy to be used at all. If
            <br />Twitter wants to be a real search
            <br />engine, they need to start
            <br />implementing real anti-spam
            <br />measures; its not easy, but its
            <br />necessary. Reviews: Twitter

            <br />  Twitter has rapidly become an
            <br />invaluable tool for news outlets:
            <br />news anchors are using Twitter
            <br />constantly to ask questions and
            <br />gather feedback from their audience,
            <br />while CNNs Breaking News account
            <br />is the #2 most followed user on
            <br />Twitter. But what ABC and Twitter
            <br />are about to do tops our list for the
            <br />boldest use of Twitter within
            <br />traditional media.
            <br />   So whats ABC conjouring up?
            <br />Well, its popular Nightline news
            <br />program and anchors are going to
            <br />host a weekly online news program
            <br />that uses Twitter for debate and
            <br />questions. Its called NightTline.
            <br />Yes, thats Nightline with two Ts.
            <br />The show airs its first episode this
            <br />Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. EST.
            <br />   According to ABC, the show will
            <br />take on Nightlines Face-Off model,
            <br />which pits two opposing sides on an
            <br />issue that an ABCNEWS anchor
            <br />provides and moderates. Its a model
            <br />that causes a lot of heated debate and
            <br />verbal exchanges, perfect for an
            <br />easily-distracted online audience.
            <br />The first question on NightTline?Is
            <br />torture ever acceptable?
            <br />   Twitter will be integral to the entire
            <br />show. There will be a Twitter widget
            <br />that allows viewers to chime in on
            <br />the discussion or ask questions
            <br />during the debate. The Nightline
            <br />anchors will also use Pixel
            <br />touchscreen technology to display
            <br />and interact with the debate
            <br />occurring on Twitter.
            <br />   The show will air digitally on the
            <br />Nightline website as well as ABC
            <br />News Now, ABCs digital
            <br />distribution network. Were very
            <br />interested to see how much the show
            <br />will rely on user participation via
            <br />Twitter for questions or responses to
            <br />the debaters. This could a be very
            <br />cool concept or this could fall flat on
            <br />its face. Well just have to watch to
            <br />find out. Reviews: Twitter

            <br />Internet News Record
            <br />  Last week I was able to catch up
            <br />with Charanjit Singh(@charanjit on
            <br />Twitter), one of the three co-founders
            <br />of the start-up Cinergix, creators of
            <br />the collaborative diagram creation
            <br />platform called Creately. Charanjit,
            <br />along with co-founders Nick Foster
            <br />and Chandika Jayasundara, have
            <br />spent the past eight months
            <br />developing a unique and powerful
            <br />tool for creating diagrams and
            <br />flowcharts that combine a process-
            <br />driven approach to project creation,
            <br />but also a social aspect that allows
            <br />for quick collaboration and sharing
            <br />of works.
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   The Idea
            <br />   Like many of us, the Creately team
            <br />wondered why all the tools out there
            <br />for creating business flowcharts
            <br />either fell in to one of two extremes:
            <br />simple, almost generic programs like
            <br />Visio or Dia that are frustrating to
            <br />use, or extremely pricey and complex
            <br />applications that include templates
            <br />that employ logic but are really only
            <br />designed for specific vertical
            <br />markets. Add to this the fact that all
            <br />of these tools were stand-alone, in
            <br />other words, they were used by one
            <br />person at a time to create files that
            <br />were often only readable by another
            <br />copy of the same application. The
            <br />Platform
            <br />   Creately combines several
            <br />technologies to overcome the
            <br />traditional shortcomings of these
            <br />types of products. First, it is built on
            <br />a web platform which means that
            <br />only a relatively modern browser and
            <br />network connection is required to use
            <br />the application. Loads of stock
            <br />templates are already available and
            <br />getting started is easy. Second, the
            <br />objects used in creating diagrams
            <br />often are imbued with logic, allowing
            <br />objects that are connected together to
            <br />evaluate their surroundings. For
            <br />example, a diagram of a simple
            <br />computer network can tell the user if
            <br />adding that additional server will
            <br />exceed the total bandwidth of the
            <br />network.
            <br />   Finally, Creately allows teams to
            <br />collaborate quickly and dynamically
            <br />on creating and refining charts,
            <br />allowing other users to be invited in
            <br />to review, comment on, and update a
            <br />diagram in a matter of minutes
            <br />without having to go through the
            <br />process of saving a copy of a file,
            <br />attempting to email it, making sure
            <br />the recipient has the same program,
            <br />and waiting for a reply.
            <br />   Charanjit sums this up the Creately
            <br />goal succinctly when he says:
            <br />  &quot;We want to offer users an easy to
            <br />use visual platform that will have the
            <br />richness of specialized tools without
            <br />the clutter, complexity and price tag
            <br />that comes with them - for the
            <br />networked generation.&quot; Our Take
            <br />   We found Creately fun to use and
            <br />definitely easier and more logical
            <br />than other diagramming tools we
            <br />have used in the past. Every part of
            <br />the user interface has been carefully
            <br />considered to optimize your time
            <br />creating the chart, not dealing with
            <br />getting arrows exactly lined up and
            <br />other annoyances. Creately sports a
            <br />wide range of object sets from simple
            <br />flowchart types to a variety of
            <br />attractive clipart sets. Also,
            <br />collaboration was easy. There is a
            <br />sidebar that can be used to invite
            <br />other people to collaborate, and
            <br />revision history is always available.

            <br />   Last but not least, Charan came
            <br />through for ReadWriteWeb readers

            <br />  Where do you get your news from?
            <br />While there's a lot of reasons to visit
            <br />Twitter online, it's essentially a place
            <br />to learn about what's going on in
            <br />your world. For the first time last
            <br />month, the site saw more unique
            <br />visitors than the websites of both the
            <br />New York Times and the Wall St.
            <br />Journal.
            <br />   Tameka Kee noticed the numbers
            <br />via traffic analysts Compete.com and
            <br />posted about them briefly on
            <br />PaidContent today. Traffic numbers
            <br />are fickle but Compete competitor
            <br />Quantcast puts Twitter even further
            <br />in the lead.
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   Kee attributes the surge to last
            <br />month's Oprah, Ashton, CNN
            <br />lovefest for Twitter. We suspect that
            <br />is just one of a number of factors.
            <br />Twitter is also really useful, fun and
            <br />captivating.
            <br />   Of course Facebook is much, much
            <br />bigger - but for some reason non-
            <br />users tend to take Facebook more
            <br />seriously than Twitter. It's probably
            <br />the Harvard connection and the
            <br />similarity with MySpace. Twitter is a
            <br />different animal. It's more interesting.
            <br />   And now it's more visited online
            <br />than the New York Times and Wall
            <br />St. Journal sites. That's pretty
            <br />incredible. Of course Twitter doesn't
            <br />create original content. Does it?
            <br />   We found the PaidContent post via
            <br />NY Times designer Jeremy Zilar ( on
            <br />Twitter) who was passing it along
            <br />from the Twitter account of
            <br />Harvard's Nieman Journalism Lab.
            <br />The Lab posted a video tour of the
            <br />New York Times R&amp;D lab this
            <br />morning, where the very forward-
            <br />looking newspaper giant is exploring
            <br />ways to deliver its content to new
            <br />devices, to satisfy advertisers in a
            <br />changed media world, and to aim
            <br />(presumably) not lose to Twitter as
            <br />the news outlet of the future.
            <br />   The Times is watching Twitter
            <br />closely. The Twitter API
            <br />(Application Programming Interface)
            <br />has been key to Twitter's success.
            <br />The NYT has released a bevy of
            <br />great APIs of its own. Tomorrow the
            <br />company will announce a new up-to-
            <br />the-minute view of all its stories
            <br />called Timeswire, linked to from the
            <br />front page of the site. PR for that
            <br />product said &quot;Think Twitter &amp;
            <br />Facebook redesign.&quot; That product is
            <br />built on top of the company's
            <br />newswire API. At a news room
            <br />strategy meeting yesterday the
            <br />company said it &quot;believes [it] can
            <br />create significant revenue streams
            <br />from APIs.&quot; That could well be the
            <br />future of news.

            <br />(BK), Options, Financial Crisis
            <br />   Late Monday, The Bank of New
            <br />York Mellon Corporation(NYSE:
            <br />BK) unveiled its plan to sell $1.2
            <br />billion worth of stock in order to
            <br />repay its TARP loan to the U.S.
            <br />Treasury Department. The company
            <br />priced 42 million shares at $28.75 a
            <br />piece, a discount of 3% to the stock's
            <br />close on Monday.
            <br />   Even though BK passed the
            <br />government's stress test with no
            <br />trouble, the bank is nonetheless eager
            <br />to raise funds and pay off its debt to
            <br />the government. Other financial
            <br />firms selling stock to repay TARP
            <br />loans include Capital One
            <br />Financial(NYSE: COF) and U.S.
            <br />Bancorp(NYSE: USB).
            <br />   However, investors seem none too
            <br />pleased with BK's dilutive stock
            <br />offering. The security shed 2.5%
            <br />within the first 10 minutes of today's
            <br />trading, extending BK's retreat from
            <br />double-top resistance at the $33
            <br />level. The shares first shied away
            <br />from this region in mid-April, and
            <br />pulled back from the $33
            <br />neighborhood again last week.

            <br />General Motors (GM) Late Monday,
            <br />regulatory filings revealed that six of
            <br />the top executives at General
            <br />Motors(NYSE: GM) sold roughly
            <br />200,000 common shares. These
            <br />transactions occurred between Friday
            <br />an Monday, as the shares jettisoned
            <br />between $1.45 and $1.61 per share.
            <br />Among those relinquishing their
            <br />shares were Vice Chairman Thomas
            <br />Stephens and Vice Chairman Robert
            <br />Lutz.
            <br />   This move comes as GM tries to
            <br />entice its creditors to exchange their
            <br />bonds for 10% in GM stock. Of
            <br />course, I'm not sure that debtors will
            <br />take on stock from a company that is
            <br />more than likely headed for
            <br />bankruptcy. I'm not too sure how the
            <br />company expects to entice such a
            <br />move; it may have to offer a lot more
            <br />than 10% stock -- like maybe new
            <br />cars.

            <br />   What really did happen Friday? I
            <br />keep thinking about this because,
            <br />surely, if you saw how well the Wells
            <br />Fargo(NYSE: WFC) ( Cramer's

            <br />presume that there would be and will

            <br />U.S. stock futures were mixed
            <br />Tuesday morning, changing direction
            <br />a few times already, in an indication
            <br />of the bull and bear battle going on
            <br />these days on Wall Street. Following
            <br />a two-month rally, bulls are
            <br />optimistic about the economy. Bears,
            <br />on the other hand, are more
            <br />concerned, and say that even if a
            <br />recovery is set to begin at the end of
            <br />the year, it will not be a V-shaped
            <br />one the bulls hope for.
            <br />  [ Update: By 8:00 am, futures
            <br />turned positive across the board.]
            <br />   Bulls are encouraged not just about
            <br />the economy, but the financial sector
            <br />too, especially following Federal
            <br />Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's
            <br />remarks late Monday. Bernanke said
            <br />the banks' stress tests appear to be
            <br />helping banks gain access to private
            <br />capital, a key element in economic
            <br />recovery. He assured that the dollar
            <br />would be strong, because the U.S.
            <br />central bank would keep inflation at
            <br />bay.
            <br />   On Monday, the White House
            <br />reported that 750,000 jobs will be
            <br />saved or created by August as a
            <br />result of the $787 billion stimulus
            <br />package.

            <br />  While lots of lawyers like to dump
            <br />trademark law into the same category
            <br />as patents and copyright as
            <br />&quot;intellectual property,&quot; it's somewhat
            <br />misleading. They come from entirely
            <br />separate parts of the law and the
            <br />purpose of trademark is entirely
            <br />different than patents or copyright.
            <br />Patents and copyright is to create
            <br />incentives to create. Trademark is
            <br />designed as consumer protection.
            <br />Lumping them together,
            <br />unfortunately, has made companies
            <br />look to treat trademark law more like
            <br />patents and copyright, and that's been
            <br />a problem. Unfortunately, over the
            <br />past few decades, this has resulted in
            <br />an extension of trademark law
            <br />beyond its original intentions
            <br />(specifically the whole concept of
            <br />&quot;dilution&quot; which is a relatively recent
            <br />addition to trademark law).
            <br />   Of course, it's also true on the
            <br />flipside, that criticism of trademark is
            <br />coming from the same folks who
            <br />criticize copyright and patent law.
            <br />The latest, as sent in by many of you,
            <br />is an interesting piece in PC World
            <br />suggesting that the open source
            <br />community should be just as angry
            <br />about trademark law as they are
            <br />about patents and copyrights. I'm not
            <br />sure that's true. While I do agree they
            <br />should be angry about the misuse of
            <br />trademark law, and any attempt to
            <br />make it more like copyright or
            <br />patents, the fundamental nature of
            <br />trademark law (to avoid consumer
            <br />confusion and potential harm from
            <br />that confusion) still makes sense. The
            <br />problem is when people falsely
            <br />believe that trademark law allows
            <br />you total exclusion, rather than only

            <br />Story
            <br />  The driver of a Boston trolley that
            <br />caused a crash that injured about 50
            <br />people was apparently sending text
            <br />messages at the time of the accident,
            <br />despite a transit authority ban on
            <br />such activity. This latest incident
            <br />comes after the horrible crash in
            <br />California last year that killed scores
            <br />of people, in which the train
            <br />conductor was said to be texting, and
            <br />highlights how bans like this,
            <br />whether covering the drivers of trains
            <br />or cars, really aren't effective. A
            <br />reasonably intelligent person driving
            <br />a trolley or other mass-transit vehicle
            <br />doesn't need a ban to tell them that
            <br />texting while driving isn't such a
            <br />good idea. If they aren't smart
            <br />enough to figure that out, they're
            <br />probably just going to ignore the ban
            <br />anyway, like this driver in Boston,
            <br />undermining the point of the rule.
            <br />Again, it goes back to personal
            <br />responsibility, something that
            <br />politicians and rulemakers won't be
            <br />able to conjure up out of legislation,
            <br />try as they might. This isn't to say
            <br />that people like trolley drivers should
            <br />be allowed to text while working --
            <br />far from it. But to think that putting a
            <br />ban into place will, in itself, simply
            <br />and easily eliminate the problem and
            <br />make everybody safer is misguided.

            <br />Story
            <br />  Fortune has a story that's getting
            <br />plenty of attention claiming that
            <br />Google&quot;seriously considered&quot; an
            <br />opportunity to purchase 19% of the
            <br />NY Times that is being held by
            <br />hedge fund Harbinger Capital
            <br />Partners. Of course, no one seems to
            <br />explain why Google would seriously
            <br />consider such an investment. It seems
            <br />like any analysis, whether serious or
            <br />not, would suggest that such an
            <br />investment would make almost no
            <br />sense for Google, and almost
            <br />certainly would cause more trouble
            <br />than it was worth. It would, for
            <br />example, freak out other newspapers,
            <br />who despite their sudden desire to get
            <br />Google to fund them, would claim
            <br />that Google was unfairly favoring the
            <br />NY Times at their expense. It would
            <br />also raise all sorts of questions about
            <br />how Google runs a content play.
            <br />While Google has experimented with
            <br />content plays with things like Knol,
            <br />the company's focus has always been
            <br />on enabling content creation -- not on
            <br />funding content itself. In fact, it's this
            <br />fundamental misunderstanding that
            <br />has newspapers incorrectly thinking
            <br />Google is trying to kill them, rather
            <br />than recognizing it's actually helping
            <br />them.

            <br />  Perhaps the most notable thing
            <br />about mobile TV is how it's been
            <br />right on the cusp of huge market
            <br />success (if you believe its
            <br />cheerleaders) for about five years.
            <br />The fact remains that mobile TV isn't
            <br />popular, and people just don't seem
            <br />interested. But don't worry: the 2010
            <br />World Cup will make mobile TV
            <br />popular, at least in Africa, says an
            <br />exec from Nokia Siemens. Of course,
            <br />that's the same thing people said
            <br />before the Beijing Olympics, before
            <br />the Euro 2008 soccer tournament,
            <br />and before the last World Cup in
            <br />2006. What's different this time
            <br />around? Apparently the fact that it's
            <br />being held in South Africa will drive
            <br />mobile TV adoption on the continent
            <br />-- but in markets like Kenya, where
            <br />the average monthly mobile spend
            <br />is$4-$7, it's still hard to see much
            <br />future for the services.

            <br />survive in this internet era? The New
            <br />York Times made mention this
            <br />weekend of a particularly interesting
            <br />project in the Czech Republic.
            <br />Google is providing local staff to
            <br />train reporters in one hyperlocal
            <br />news network in the use of services
            <br />like Google Maps, Google Translate
            <br />and YouTube.
            <br />   An Amsterdam based holding
            <br />company called PPF and the Paris
            <br />based World Association of
            <br />Newspapers are funding a fascinating
            <br />project that will launch 30 different
            <br />websites covering hyperlocal news
            <br />throughout the Czech Republic.
            <br />Google will provide technical
            <br />training and the sites will run
            <br />AdSense in exchange. In order to
            <br />maximize contact with the local
            <br />community, the project has hired 90
            <br />mostly young reporters who will
            <br />work out of offices with public
            <br />coffee and internet shops built into
            <br />the facilities.
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   Will this idea work? Who knows,
            <br />but it sure sounds like a fun
            <br />experiment. There are lots of
            <br />different factors at issue, not the least
            <br />of which is the hyper-local nature of
            <br />the news being reported. Eric Pfanner
            <br />in the Times says &quot;think garbage
            <br />collection schedules, not Group of 7
            <br />diplomacy.&quot;
            <br />   The idea brings to mind the
            <br />Lawrence Journal World, a well
            <br />known model of effective local
            <br />online reporting. If Google and other
            <br />online specialists could help more
            <br />newspapers rock like LJWorld.com
            <br />does, then things could really look up
            <br />for local news.
            <br />   To be fair, some people attribute
            <br />LJWorld's success to its local near
            <br />monopoly across different media
            <br />types - but the company has been
            <br />wildly innovative in terms of types of
            <br />content, interactivity, mobile and the
            <br />creation of a content management
            <br />system (Django) that is now used by
            <br />newspapers around the world. The
            <br />company even offers an RSS feed of
            <br />their most-clicked classified ads and
            <br />displays those in a widget throughout
            <br />the site. That's cool. Anyone
            <br />interested in local news online should
            <br />make sure to spend some time
            <br />looking around the website of the
            <br />Lawrence Journal World.

            <br />   Why not have web specialists offer
            <br />training to more old fashioned news
            <br />organizations in order to create a
            <br />more compelling product? This
            <br />morning I was watching a trailer for
            <br />an immersive multiplayer game
            <br />about to launch and thought: lots of
            <br />people are willing to pay $20 to $50
            <br />once or as a subscription for these
            <br />really compelling game experiences -
            <br />couldn't the news organizations of
            <br />the future better leverage the internet
            <br />to create an experience that people
            <br />would pay for? Either pay for or
            <br />view advertisements through? From
            <br />games to iPhone apps to really useful
            <br />software otherwise, I know I'm
            <br />willing to pay for things. The local
            <br />news rag just doesn't do anything
            <br />moving enough for me to pay for it,
            <br />other than a weekend print edition
            <br />that I have delivered to my house.
            <br />Their website certainly isn't
            <br />interesting enough to visit.
            <br />   Be it through subscriptions,
            <br />micropayments or advertising, this
            <br />whole historic dilemma of the death
            <br />of newspapers, local news and
            <br />investigative reporting sure seems
            <br />like it would be a different scenario if
            <br />the news producers just made a more
            <br />compelling product. Our expectations
            <br />are higher these days because we
            <br />have the internet. So make something
            <br />awesome that takes advantage of all
            <br />this technology. (Granted, this
            <br />doesn't take into account the
            <br />reticence of local advertisers to buy
            <br />online. That's not the only problem
            <br />newspapers are facing, though.)
            <br />   Programs that put technical
            <br />specialists into the newsroom to
            <br />teach technical skills sound like a
            <br />great avenue to explore. It would be
            <br />good to see Google's program in the
            <br />Czech Republic expand outside of
            <br />that country and for other vendors to
            <br />be offering similar services. Let's see
            <br />a Vimeo Professional Services.
            <br />Reddit is used by papers but not
            <br />nearly as well as it is on Reddit.com.
            <br />How many microblogging services
            <br />could do themselves and the local
            <br />paper a lot of good with some
            <br />symbiosis through training services?
            <br />I think this is a very interesting idea.
            <br />   For more on this general topic, I'm
            <br />going to listen to this collection of
            <br />podcasts by Dave Winer and NYU

            <br />  On Monday, Amazon.com put out a
            <br />small tweak to its Kindle application
            <br />for Apple's iPhone( iTunes link) that
            <br />takes users to an iPhone-optimized
            <br />store when they click on the &quot;get
            <br />books&quot; button.
            <br />   There's now a page that lets users
            <br />search either by title, author,
            <br />keyword, or category. It also lists
            <br />some of the New York Times best
            <br />sellers, and items that have been
            <br />recommended based on past
            <br />purchases and browsing habits.
            <br />Previously it would simply offer up a
            <br />link to the desktop version of
            <br />Amazon's Kindle Web store, which
            <br />required a whole lot of pinching and
            <br />zooming around to find what you
            <br />were looking for.
            <br />   Despite the change, the application
            <br />still kicks users out to the Safari
            <br />application instead of implementing
            <br />the browsing experience within the
            <br />Kindle app itself. It's safe to assume
            <br />this will change in the next iteration,
            <br />since Amazon acquired the company
            <br />that created the popular Stanza
            <br />eBook reading application in late
            <br />April, which includes a built-in
            <br />catalog of books that users can
            <br />purchase.
            <br />   There's also the soon-to-be-released
            <br />iPhone 3.0 OS update, which will
            <br />allow developers to add in-app
            <br />micropayments--something that's
            <br />perfect for eBooks. As it stands you
            <br />still need to handle that end of the
            <br />transaction on Amazon's site, instead
            <br />of on the Kindle app.
            <br />   Clicking on the &quot;get books&quot; button
            <br />in Amazon's Kindle app for the
            <br />iPhone now takes users to a thumb-
            <br />friendly version of Amazon's
            <br />storefront. However, clicking any of
            <br />these options will kick you out to
            <br />Amazon's Web app in Safari.(Credit:

            <br />application stand out, but I like prefer
            <br />something punchier when it comes to
            <br />showing me which tab is active.
            <br />Chromium on the Mac uses stronger
            <br />contrast than Firefox and Safari to
            <br />spotlight the active tab, which is a
            <br />step forward in usability at least in
            <br />my tab-infested life.
            <br />   The user interface itself was
            <br />familiar coming from Windows,
            <br />aside from the aforementioned menu
            <br />change. For example, opening the
            <br />browser or a new tab shows, by
            <br />default, the array of nine Web page
            <br />thumbnails that Windows gets.
            <br />   One of my favorite parts of the
            <br />Mac, the multitouch trackpad, is
            <br />largely ignored by Chromium for
            <br />now, alas.
            <br />   But I uncovered some niceties, too.
            <br />First of all, I love the way new tabs
            <br />sprout up--and that's coming from a
            <br />person who disables menu
            <br />animations in Windows. Second, I
            <br />found that the new-tab view scales
            <br />down the thumbnails when I shrank
            <br />the window. It turns out that Chrome
            <br />on Windows does this, too, but not
            <br />with live images of the thumbnails
            <br />resizing, so it's hard to notice.
            <br />   When I surveyed readers about
            <br />what it would take to get them to
            <br />switch to Chrome, the second-place
            <br />answer was lack of Mac support.
            <br />Overall, it's clear that the Mac
            <br />version, while certainly not ready for
            <br />prime time, is well on its way. So all
            <br />you curious Mac OS X users, take
            <br />the plunge.

            <br />justifications for his moves. But
            <br />when they turned to Cheese and
            <br />asked him how he knew the way to
            <br />tweak the proteinsfor example, by
            <br />orienting hydrophobic sidechains
            <br />toward the protein corehe
            <br />shrugged and said, &quot;It just looks
            <br />right.&quot;
            <br />   And that is exactly what Baker was
            <br />looking for. &quot;When I said early on
            <br />that I hoped Foldit would help me
            <br />find protein-folding prodigies, it was
            <br />hopeful speculation,&quot; he says. &quot;It's
            <br />fantastic to see it come true.&quot;
            <br />   The next CASP is two years away,
            <br />and Baker doesn't want to lose
            <br />Foldit's momentum. He and Popovi
            <br />have given the players a challenge:
            <br />Design a new protein. Baker's lab is
            <br />developing targets for cancer, AIDS,
            <br />and Alzheimer's, and the folders' task
            <br />is to build a small protein drug with
            <br />the right shape and binding
            <br />properties. This isn't just an
            <br />intellectual exercise. Baker says he
            <br />will synthesize the most promising
            <br />structures and test them in his lab.
            <br />These proteins could actually have
            <br />therapeutic value in the real world,
            <br />outside the game. And if they do, the
            <br />Foldit players will share the credit. It
            <br />might be the first time that a
            <br />computer game's high score is a
            <br />Nobel Prize.

            <br />   I spent the better part of Monday
            <br />trying out the Mac OS X version of
            <br />Chromium, the open-source project
            <br />on which Google Chrome is based,
            <br />and I'm favorably impressed.
            <br />   The software, available for
            <br />download from the Chromium Web
            <br />site, is incomplete and definitely
            <br />buggy, as one would expect for a
            <br />developer version that reflects all the
            <br />latest changes programmers are
            <br />making with the project. But for Mac
            <br />users who've been clamoring for the
            <br />software, I can tell you that overall, it
            <br />works, and it shows glimmers of
            <br />what I liked about the open-source
            <br />browser on Windows.
            <br />   I used build 15752, released at 8
            <br />a.m. PDT, but just to give you a
            <br />flavor of the pace of publicly
            <br />available Chrome development, 19
            <br />new versions arrived in less than 12
            <br />hours afterward.
            <br />   So you'd be ill-advised to call this
            <br />well-tested software that's had time
            <br />to mature into stability. But I think
            <br />it's good enough for the Mac curious
            <br />to try.
            <br />   Chromium for Mac OS X will be
            <br />familiar to those who've used
            <br />Chrome for Windows.(Credit:
            <br />Screenshot by Stephen
            <br />Shankland/CNET) So why bother?
            <br />   There was a day, about a decade
            <br />and a half ago, when a Web browser
            <br />was a revolutionary technology.
            <br />Google's browser is not that, but
            <br />Chrome does have its moments, in
            <br />my opinion: high performance in
            <br />launching, loading pages, and
            <br />running Web-based JavaScript
            <br />programs; a get-out-of-the-way user
            <br />interface; and a combination search
            <br />and Web address bar called the
            <br />Omnibox (though it should be noted
            <br />that many see the Omnibox as a
            <br />privacy invasion, not a useful tool).
            <br />   Those advantages aren't enough to
            <br />get most folks to install a new
            <br />browser, much less uproot and
            <br />change to a new default. But if you're
            <br />a tech enthusiast, give it a whirl, and
            <br />if you're a Web developer, take it
            <br />seriously, given Google's muscle and
            <br />its stated ambition to use Chrome to
            <br />advance the state of the art for Web
            <br />applications.
            <br />   Google has put a lot on the line
            <br />with the project, pushing Chrome by
            <br />funding many programmers, paying
            <br />for TV ads and launching
            <br />promotional stunts, and Google is
            <br />moving fast, and it's catching up to
            <br />rivals' features.
            <br />   Here's a snapshot of today's to-do
            <br />list. Extensions, which in Chrome's
            <br />case reuse Web page coding
            <br />methods, are gradually maturing and
            <br />should be available in more than their
            <br />present rudimentary state. Themes,
            <br />which will permit a custom look to
            <br />the browser, are imminent: A &quot; first
            <br />pass&quot; at the technology arrived
            <br />Saturday in what will become a new
            <br />developer version of Chrome.
            <br />   Local storage, a feature of the still-
            <br />unfinished HTML 5 standard that can
            <br />improve performance and let Web
            <br />applications work better offline, is
            <br />due &quot;real soon now,&quot; according to
            <br />Chrome programmer Aaron
            <br />Boodman. RSS feed subscription is
            <br />en route.
            <br />  &quot;Stay tuned for some exciting new
            <br />features we hope to land in the Dev
            <br />channel,&quot; said Google Chrome
            <br />Program Manager Mark Larson in a
            <br />blog post Friday.
            <br />   Chromium doesn't even qualify as
            <br />stable enough to be called an Alpha,
            <br />so guess what? It's buggy.(Credit:
            <br />Screenshot by Stephen
            <br />Shankland/CNET) Bugs, naturally
            <br />   The worst shortcoming I found for
            <br />ordinary Web surfing was that Adobe
            <br />Systems' widely used Flash
            <br />technology didn't work. Sure, that
            <br />means I didn't have to grimace
            <br />through the Intel Sponsors of
            <br />Tomorrow demo of banana
            <br />aerodynamics, but it also means
            <br />YouTube didn't work, which is a
            <br />showstopper.
            <br />   Also in my day's testing I got three
            <br />crashes, none during particularly
            <br />unusual activities. The first, while
            <br />clicking a link in a Gmail message,
            <br />took down the whole browser. The
            <br />second two--while using Google
            <br />Translate and Facebook chat--just
            <br />crashed the tab while the rest of
            <br />Chromium marched on unfazed.
            <br />   Three crashes in a day is bad, but
            <br />again, this is about as raw and
            <br />untested as software gets, so I'll cut
            <br />the developers slack.
            <br />   I also had other problems. In
            <br />Gmail, attachments didn't work, and
            <br />in a Gmail message, labels were
            <br />stacked on top of each other instead
            <br />of running side by side. I had some
            <br />sluggish visits of Web pages. I
            <br />missed some keyboard shortcuts to
            <br />command the browser to show
            <br />downloads and to move back to the
            <br />last page, for example. Google Docs
            <br />wouldn't load until I appended the
            <br />&quot;?browserok=true&quot; option to the Web
            <br />address, and then, as with some other
            <br />sites, it trouble with its frame across
            <br />the top of the page.
            <br />   But most pages did work for me,
            <br />even ones such as Yahoo Mail and
            <br />Microsoft Hotmail where I've had
            <br />new-browser teething problems in
            <br />the past. Most straight-up Web pages
            <br />rendered just fine and only broke
            <br />down when dealing with more
            <br />elaborate JavaScript actions.

            <br />tests
            <br />   Even better, Chromium loaded
            <br />them very quickly in my unscientific
            <br />side-by-side tests of Firefox 3.5 beta
            <br />4, Safari 4 beta, and Chromium. I
            <br />was trying this out on a 2.8GHz dual-
            <br />core MacBook Pro with Mac OS X
            <br />10.5.6.
            <br />   Somewhat more quantified were
            <br />my launch-speed tests. Here,
            <br />Chromium and Safari tied at about 3
            <br />seconds to launch after a reboot,
            <br />though subsequent relaunches were
            <br />all faster at about a second. One of
            <br />the most pleasurable aspects of
            <br />Chrome on Windows for me is its
            <br />near-instant launch, especially given
            <br />my need to reboot Windows XP
            <br />about once a day, so I was glad to see
            <br />this performance on the Mac, as well.
            <br />   I'm also glad to see Mozilla has put
            <br />faster launch speed in its priority list
            <br />for the successor to Firefox 3.5, but
            <br />to be fair, it's the only browser here
            <br />that has extensions, so I'm willing to
            <br />overlook a bit of programming
            <br />overhead.
            <br />   Then I did some real tests of
            <br />JavaScript speed. All three browsers
            <br />have been pushing heavily to
            <br />improve how fast Web-based
            <br />programs written in this language
            <br />perform, with the likely end result
            <br />that we'll see faster and richer Web
            <br />applications. Google, developer of
            <br />JavaScript-powered Web apps such
            <br />as Gmail and Google Docs, has the
            <br />most at stake of these browser
            <br />vendors.
            <br />   So it was interesting to see that on
            <br />two prominent JavaScript speed tests,
            <br />SunSpider 0.9 and Google's V8
            <br />benchmark, Chromium came out on
            <br />top. On V8, where big numbers are
            <br />better, Chromium scored 2,968 to
            <br />Safari's 2,212 and Firefox's meager
            <br />140. On Sunspider, where short
            <br />scores are better, Chromium scored
            <br />669 to Safari's 772 and Firefox's
            <br />dismal 9,541.
            <br />   However, on the Google-sponsored
            <br />JavaScript Experiments site,
            <br />Chromium didn't fare as well.
            <br />   On my favorite, Ball Pool
            <br />Chromium couldn't handle the
            <br />sloshing window-shake effects, and it
            <br />looked to me like it lagged Safari in
            <br />performance. Both fared better than
            <br />Firefox, which was poky.
            <br />   On another, RayTracer, Chromium
            <br />handled the default graphics
            <br />rendering in 5.8 seconds to Safari's
            <br />8.5 and Firefox's 25.6. On Wavy
            <br />Scrollbars, Safari worked with
            <br />aplomb, Chromium was broken with
            <br />a static display, and Firefox wouldn't
            <br />load it at all.
            <br />   Chromium for the Mac, at top, puts
            <br />more visual emphasis on tab
            <br />navigation than Firefox, the middle,
            <br />or Safari 4, at bottom.(Credit:
            <br />Screenshot by Stephen
            <br />Shankland/CNET) Does it look the
            <br />same?
            <br />   One Chromium-on-Mac aspect I
            <br />was particularly curious about was to
            <br />see how well the software fit in with
            <br />the Mac. Would Google aim for
            <br />something that looked identical to the
            <br />Windows version, or try to fit in with
            <br />the general Mac user interface?
            <br />   Overall, the answer is the latter.
            <br />For example, the Windows version
            <br />puts its two menus for dealing with
            <br />windows and tools to the right of the
            <br />combination address and search bar
            <br />Google calls the Omnibox. On the
            <br />Mac version, menus are the plain old
            <br />kind in the menu bar that always
            <br />lives across the top of the screen,
            <br />disassociated from the browser
            <br />window itself.
            <br />   And Chrome's blue color scheme
            <br />on Windows adopts the Mac's neutral
            <br />gray. Apple's subdued window-frame
            <br />tones are nice when it's time to let the

            <br />  As soon as Zoran Popovi saw the
            <br />hair, he knew he was looking at
            <br />David Baker. It was unmistakable:
            <br />Baker's face is surrounded by an
            <br />umbra of curls that organize
            <br />themselves into unpredictable
            <br />spiralsnot unlike the complex
            <br />protein molecules he studies. They
            <br />hadn't met before; Popovi is an
            <br />expert in graphics, a computer
            <br />scientist at the University of
            <br />Washington in Seattle, and Baker is a
            <br />biochemistry professor with a
            <br />laboratory a few blocks away. But
            <br />David Salesin, another computer
            <br />scientist and a friend of Baker's, had
            <br />arranged for the three of them to
            <br />meet for lunch in a restaurant near
            <br />campus, because Baker needed help
            <br />with a tricky problemand it was
            <br />exactly the kind of problem Popovi
            <br />was good at solving.
            <br />   Baker was the Most Valuable
            <br />Player in the protein chemistry
            <br />world's biennial World Series, a
            <br />competition to see who can predict
            <br />the shape a protein will fold into,
            <br />knowing nothing more than the
            <br />sequence of its constituent parts. It's
            <br />called the Community-Wide
            <br />Experiment on the Critical
            <br />Assessment of Techniques for
            <br />Protein Structure Prediction, or
            <br />CASP.
            <br />   With the help of a formidable
            <br />weapon called Rosetta@home,
            <br />Baker's team had dominated CASP
            <br />since 1998. Like SETI @home, the
            <br />screensaver that taps spare home
            <br />computer cycles to sort through radio
            <br />signals from space, Rosetta farms out
            <br />computation to volunteered PCs. The
            <br />86,000 computers around the world
            <br />that run it would give Baker the
            <br />rough equivalent of a 77-teraflop
            <br />supercomputer for the November
            <br />2006 iteration of CASP a few weeks
            <br />later. But Rosetta@home was getting
            <br />stumped by puzzles that Baker
            <br />thought humans, with their superior
            <br />spatial reasoning, would solve easily.
            <br />   Baker suggested that users should
            <br />have some way to tell the screensaver
            <br />to try a different approach. Popovi
            <br />shook his head. &quot;No one's going to
            <br />care about that,&quot; he said. &quot;If you
            <br />really want people to get engaged,
            <br />you should put people at the center.&quot;
            <br />   Salesin thought so, tooin fact, he
            <br />thought protein folding would make
            <br />a terrific computer game. That's why
            <br />he'd set up this lunch. Baker, thinking
            <br />about the intense focus he'd seen on
            <br />the face of his preteen son when
            <br />playing videogames, agreed.
            <br />   The game they came up with,
            <br />Foldit, doesn't have orcs or quests or
            <br />gravity hammers. It simply serves up
            <br />a multicolored knot of spirals and
            <br />clumpsa 3-D render of a protein.
            <br />Players use the cursor to grab, bend,
            <br />pull, and wiggle the chain of amino
            <br />acids anywhere along its length,
            <br />folding the protein into its optimum
            <br />shape. The only rules are based on
            <br />physicsopposite charges attract,
            <br />atomic bonds have limited angles of
            <br />rotation, and the parts of the
            <br />molecule that stick to water tend to
            <br />point outward. The closer your
            <br />model's properties adhere to those
            <br />rules, the more points you get.
            <br />   More than 100,000 people have
            <br />downloaded Foldit since last
            <br />summer, turning the game into
            <br />massively multiplayer
            <br />competitionglobal online
            <br />molecular speed origami. And when
            <br />they came up with potentially
            <br />accurate CASP protein structures,
            <br />Baker entered those into the
            <br />competition.
            <br />   Whoever cracks the hidden secrets
            <br />of protein folding will push us that
            <br />much closer to new antibiotics,
            <br />cancer treatments, and biofuels.

            <br />  Crowds gather at Tempelhof airport
            <br />to remember operation that saved
            <br />city from starvation
            <br />   On the 60th anniversary of the
            <br />lifting of the Soviet blockade of
            <br />Berlin, the city honoured the veterans
            <br />and mourned the victims of one of
            <br />the most extraordinary international
            <br />operations in aviation history: the
            <br />airlift that saved its people from
            <br />starvation.
            <br />   Crowds came to Tempelhof airport,
            <br />where at the height of the airlift an
            <br />allied plane landed every 62 seconds,
            <br />to honour 120 British, American and
            <br />French veterans attending the
            <br />ceremonies. For 15 months from 26
            <br />June 1948 they were joined by pilots
            <br />from Canada, Australia, New
            <br />Zealand and South Africa in 278,000
            <br />flights carrying 2.3m tonnes of food,
            <br />medicine, coal and other supplies
            <br />into the besieged city.
            <br />   On both the Soviet and the allied
            <br />sides, the fate of Berlin became part
            <br />of the propaganda war which
            <br />escalated into the cold war of the
            <br />1950s.
            <br />   As the Soviet claws closed 
            <br />cutting off all land and sea routes 
            <br />the airlift, nicknamed Operation
            <br />Vittles, was the only way in for the
            <br />desperately needed necessities of life
            <br /> and occasionally a few luxuries.
            <br />   The veterans who returned
            <br />included &quot;the Lollipop Bomber&quot;, Gail
            <br />Halvorsen, a pilot from Utah. Early
            <br />in the airlift he shared two sticks of
            <br />gum with some children, and was
            <br />moved to watch others sniffing and
            <br />licking the wrappers. He promised to
            <br />drop them some sweets the following
            <br />day, using handkerchiefs as
            <br />parachutes and his own rations: he
            <br />continued it on every flight
            <br />throughout the months, helped by
            <br />thousands of donated handkerchiefs
            <br />and sweets as the story spread  a
            <br />tradition honoured in hundreds of
            <br />packets of chocolate raisins dropped
            <br />from one of the original aircraft as
            <br />part of the celebrations.
            <br />   The monument outside the airport,
            <br />intended to symbolise the three air
            <br />corridors into the city, bears the
            <br />ominous nickname the Hunger Claw.
            <br />It carries the names of the 39 British
            <br />and 31 American pilots who lost their
            <br />lives in the operation.
            <br />   After the celebrations, Tempelhof
            <br />will return to the echoing silence
            <br />which descended last October when,
            <br />despite a campaign to retain what is
            <br />one of the world's oldest airports 
            <br />partly inspired by its imposing art
            <br />deco architecture, partly by its place
            <br />in the city's history  all flights
            <br />ended. Its fate is still to be decided.

            <br />   Things Touch 1.3.5 has been
            <br />released along with Things 1.1 and,
            <br />among a heap of bug fixes and UI
            <br />improvements, you'll find a new
            <br />feature for syncing Areas of
            <br />Responsibility from your Mac to
            <br />your iPhone (it's not yet possible to
            <br />create Areas in Things Touch). The
            <br />feature requires Things 1.1 on the
            <br />Mac side, which was officially
            <br />released today, but has actually been
            <br />available (sans release notes) for
            <br />about a week (assumedly waiting for
            <br />Things Touch to make it through
            <br />App Store approval).
            <br />   Another new addition (which is
            <br />more exciting, to me) is full
            <br />AppleScript support in Things on the
            <br />Mac. I haven't had a chance to dive
            <br />into it yet, but it's a topic I discussed
            <br />with Cultured Code at the last
            <br />Macworld Expo and I'm excited to
            <br />see it come to fruition. People using
            <br />Things in any kind of group setting
            <br />will appreciate the reconsidered
            <br />approach to task delegation, as well.
            <br />   For those who aren't familiar with
            <br />Things in general, I'll take a quick
            <br />step back. Things for the Mac has
            <br />been a staunch competitor in the Mac
            <br />task-management colosseum.
            <br />Battling it out with OmniFocus and
            <br />newer gladiators like The Hit List,
            <br />it's been recognized by many for its
            <br />simplicity and elegance. Things is
            <br />powerful and flexible, while
            <br />remaining reliable and simple.
            <br />Things Touch is its iPhone
            <br />companion, usable on its own or
            <br />synced with Things Mac.
            <br />   You may be asking, what's an
            <br />&quot;Area of Responsibility?&quot; This is one
            <br />of the features of Things which was
            <br />hardest for me to grasp. It's not quite
            <br />a GTD context, and it's not a folder
            <br />for projects. Basically, Areas provide
            <br />a flexible means of handling tasks
            <br />which aren't part of a &quot;project&quot; and
            <br />aren't necessarily sequential in
            <br />nature. In the words of Cultured
            <br />Code:
            <br />   With an Area of Responsibility (or
            <br />simply &quot;Area&quot;), you don't ask
            <br />yourself about the desired outcome,
            <br />but what standards you would like to
            <br />maintain. An Area corresponds to an
            <br />ongoing activity. These could be, for
            <br />example, job responsibilities, roles
            <br />you have taken on in your family, or
            <br />personal responsibilities like health.
            <br />   Things is available for download as
            <br />a free trial, and can be purchased for
            <br />$49.95US. Things Touch, the iPhone
            <br />version, is available in the App Store
            <br />for $9.99US.

            <br />  True, Sanyo's LP-WXU700 is
            <br />limited to a WXGA (1280 x 800)
            <br />pixel image. But it's still the world's
            <br />first to transmit that video over
            <br />802.11b/g/n (draft 2.0). Grabbing
            <br />wireless video off your Vista PC is a
            <br />snap thanks to the projector's
            <br />Windows Embedded CE 6.0 software
            <br />with Video Streaming Function that
            <br />links back to Vista's Network
            <br />Projector Function. Spec-wise we're
            <br />looking at a 0.74-inch 3LCD panel
            <br />capable of projecting a 100-inch
            <br />image at a distance of 2.5 to 4-meters
            <br />at 3,800 lumens with a 500:1 contrast
            <br />ratio. Sanyo even tosses in a single
            <br />HDMI jack in addition to the usual
            <br />analog inputs. While, it's targeted at
            <br />offices and schools, it wouldn't
            <br />surprise us to see this  62,790 (about
            <br />$642) projector show up in make-
            <br />shift home theaters and gaming
            <br />rooms when it launches in June.
            <br />   Update: Oops, dropped a 0 from
            <br />the price. It's actually 627,900 or
            <br />about $6,445 according to the native
            <br />English press release -- but even that
            <br />doesn't sound right.

            <br />  The netbook formula hasn't evolved
            <br />much since its inception, still
            <br />offering largely the same
            <br />configuration and performance as it
            <br />ever has. That likely won't change
            <br />until the end of the summer, with
            <br />Intel announcing that it's even
            <br />thinking about retiring the newer
            <br />Atom N280 processor and GN40
            <br />chipset entirely, leaving the older and
            <br />more common N270 with its
            <br />945GSE as the main choice until
            <br />September, when the new Pineview
            <br />Atom chips might finally hit
            <br />production. The company is also
            <br />creating a whitebox N270-based 8.9-
            <br />inch netbook that it's shopping
            <br />around to resellers, again not doing
            <br />any favors to fans of variety. Moving
            <br />up to skinny 12- to 13-inch
            <br />notebooks, Intel is still pushing its
            <br />CULV architecture, and has its dual-
            <br />core Calpella platform poised for
            <br />inclusion in anything with a targeted
            <br />MSRP of $1,200 and above -- and a
            <br />release date sometime after the third
            <br />quarter. That's a few months too late
            <br />to catch the needy college freshman
            <br />crowd, Intel.

            <br />  Wonder what the future of the
            <br />netbook is -- or at least what's
            <br />coming after Intel's roadmap runs out
            <br />of paper? Lenovo's in-house analyst
            <br />Matt Kohut may have the answer,
            <br />chatting with TECH.BLORGE to
            <br />make some entirely sensible
            <br />predictions about the next netbooks.
            <br />He indicates that touchscreens and
            <br />the like will become increasingly
            <br />popular, helping to drive the
            <br />popularity of Windows 7 and its top-
            <br />notch touch support, and continuing
            <br />the move away from Linux that
            <br />Lenovo identified back in 2007. He
            <br />also thinks netbooks will start to get
            <br />bigger, pushing the 12- to 14-inch
            <br />range, a trend we're already seeing
            <br />the beginnings of with rumors of
            <br />ASUS and its supposed 11.6-inch
            <br />Eee PC. Finally, he figures machines
            <br />will get even cheaper than they
            <br />already are, and that 3G will be more
            <br />or less standard soon. It's challenging
            <br />stuff, this prediction business, but
            <br />feel free to try your hand at it below.

            <br />  It would appear that the Canadian
            <br />Parliament is no big fan of
            <br />transparency. When some activists
            <br />started posting video and audio of
            <br />various Parliamentary committee
            <br />proceedings online, in order to both
            <br />increase transparency and to
            <br />comment on those proceedings,
            <br />lawyers apparently sent them a cease
            <br />and desist, claiming it was &quot;contempt
            <br />of Parliament.&quot; They've also been
            <br />sending takedowns to YouTube and
            <br />other video hosting sites, claiming
            <br />that this content is somehow
            <br />proprietary, covered by &quot;crown
            <br />copyright&quot; (something, thankfully,
            <br />we don't have in the US) and subject
            <br />to severe licensing restrictions. While
            <br />it sounds like some Canadian
            <br />politicians recognize the need to
            <br />change, in the meantime, they're
            <br />making a travesty of any sense of
            <br />governmental openness.

            <br />  It's always amusing to see what
            <br />people feel they &quot;deserve.&quot; Reader
            <br />Brad writes in to point out that
            <br />Aretha Franklin apparently told a
            <br />radio reporter recently that she
            <br />deserves royalties for any sales of the
            <br />famous hat she wore to the
            <br />inauguration. It's unclear if she was
            <br />joking (one hopes she was)... But it
            <br />does seem to be a common theme,
            <br />where people suddenly think they
            <br />automatically deserve a cut of
            <br />something, despite not having set up
            <br />an agreement for that beforehand.
            <br />Newspapers want a cut of Google's
            <br />revenues. Record labels want a cut of
            <br />ISP revenue (and Apple's revenue). It
            <br />just happens so often that it's worth
            <br />calling out -- even in a totally
            <br />ridiculous discussion about a hat. No
            <br />one deserves a cut of anything if they
            <br />didn't actually negotiate it
            <br />beforehand.

            <br />  Whats your process for notifying
            <br />new contacts of your social presence
            <br />online? Is it an extensive email
            <br />signature with prominent social site
            <br />links? A mobile business card app? A
            <br />myriad of tweets, phone calls, or IM
            <br />chat sessions? Maybe all of the
            <br />above?
            <br />   GizaPage, which launches today, is
            <br />a social network organizer that aims
            <br />to make this process a lot less
            <br />daunting. Yes, weve seen the idea
            <br />before  think chi.mp and Cliqset
            <br />but GizaPage has a few extra twists
            <br />worthy of mention, one of which is to
            <br />provide you with a public profile
            <br />webpage with all your social profiles
            <br />side-by-side.
            <br />   With GizaPage, users start by
            <br />importing their contacts from
            <br />LinkedIn, Gmail, Yahoo, AOL,
            <br />Plaxo, Hotmail, Lycos, Orkut, or
            <br />Rediff Mail. This makes it easy to
            <br />connect if these contacts join
            <br />GizaPage at a later date. The next
            <br />step is to individually add new sites,
            <br />or pin profiles, to your GizaPage.
            <br />   Theres more than 40 sites to
            <br />choose from, and the list includes
            <br />obvious favorites like Facebook,
            <br />Twitter, Digg, and more niche
            <br />services like Pandora, Furl, and
            <br />Magnolia. The process is one-by-one,
            <br />but no passwords are required, and
            <br />for each site, users specify whether it
            <br />should be public, private, or just
            <br />accessible to friends.
            <br />   The accumulated end result of
            <br />social profiles is a single site with
            <br />tabs that let visitors toggle through
            <br />views of each of your profiles. So, if
            <br />you have your Facebook, Flickr,
            <br />FriendFeed, and Furl accounts
            <br />configured, anyone you share your
            <br />GizaPage link with can (depending
            <br />on your privacy settings) quickly tab
            <br />through each site to get a complete
            <br />view of what youre doing, and
            <br />where, online. Essentially, the idea is
            <br />that youre not only owning your
            <br />social identity, but also making it
            <br />super simple for new contacts to find
            <br />you online.
            <br />   Now that Googles trying to
            <br />connect the dots with public profiles,
            <br />and making it imperative for you to
            <br />use them, we have to wonder if a
            <br />new site like GizaPage can make
            <br />themselves stand tall against a giant
            <br />of a competitor. Sure GizaPage does
            <br />so much more, and Google profiles
            <br />leave much to be desired, but with
            <br />stiff competition, is there room for
            <br />another social network organizer to
            <br />succeed? Let us know what you think

            <br />  In the last couple of weeks,
            <br />Facebook has started improving all
            <br />sorts of little things around the site: it
            <br />added semi real-time notifications
            <br />about new posts in your stream, and
            <br />most recently it added the possibility
            <br />of creating custom friend lists in
            <br />Facebook Chat.
            <br />   Now, its added popup alerts above
            <br />the chat box, which instantly notify
            <br />you about events such as one of your
            <br />friends writing on the wall and the
            <br />like. The popups appear
            <br />automatically, stay up for a couple of
            <br />seconds and then are gone; you can
            <br />still find a list of all the notifications
            <br />by clicking on the icon in the lower
            <br />right corner of the screen.
            <br />   Normally, Im happy about real-
            <br />time updates on Facebook; I loved
            <br />the live feed and I still miss it, but
            <br />this time Im not so sure.
            <br />Notifications include a lot of ads and
            <br />spam from applications youve
            <br />installed, and I dont want to be
            <br />constantly nagged by a popup, saying
            <br />that (for example) I have new
            <br />SpeedDate matches.
            <br />   You can turn off specific types of
            <br />notifications, by clicking on the X to
            <br />close the popup, after which youll
            <br />be asked to permanently turn off
            <br />future notifications of that same type.
            <br />However, the option to completely
            <br />kill popups of any kind would be
            <br />nice. Reviews: Facebook

            <br />   The Kindle 2 is zippier, with pages
            <br />turning 20 percent faster (yes, you
            <br />can tell the difference). It has more
            <br />memory (2 gigabytes, enough for
            <br />storing more than 1,500 books
            <br />onboard). And it flaunts a more
            <br />powerful built-in battery: Amazon
            <br />claims that the Kindle lasts four to
            <br />five days with the wireless on (we
            <br />got 4.5 days in our first test) and up
            <br />to two weeks with it off. After a
            <br />week of limited wireless, my meter is
            <br />around 50 percent. Amazon also says
            <br />that after 500 charges, it will hold 80
            <br />percent of its original juice. That
            <br />means that most users won't have to
            <br />replace the battery (a $60 procedure)
            <br />for about a decade or so.
            <br />   Looking over the horizon, it's clear

            <br />   The iWOW adapter from SRS Labs
            <br />promises to coax more &quot;immersive&quot;
            <br />sound from your iPod, and it actually
            <br />delivers  provided you're listening
            <br />to the right kind of music. Setup is
            <br />easy: Snap on the slick little 1-inch
            <br />extension, plug in some spendy
            <br />headphones, press a button, and you
            <br />do indeed get a fuller sound with
            <br />more depth  especially if you enjoy
            <br />songs like Sting's &quot;Fragile,&quot; a track
            <br />hand-picked by SRS to highlight the
            <br />effect.
            <br />   But when iWOW was applied to
            <br />songs that were heavy on low-end
            <br />thump or had multilayered sound
            <br />(Exhibit A: Beck's &quot;Cold Brains&quot;) the

            <br />At top volume, bass beats splintered,
            <br />while at lower volumes tracks

            <br />Instead of relying solely on computer
            <br />cycles to accelerate his research,
            <br />Baker has harnessed neurons and the
            <br />human urge to play. And if his army
            <br />of gamers yields a few savants? So
            <br />much the better, Baker says. &quot;We're
            <br />looking for prodigies.&quot;
            <br />   Hydrogen, the most common
            <br />molecule in the universe, is just two
            <br />atomseach with one proton and
            <br />one electron.
            <br />   Proteins, the chemical structures
            <br />that underpin everything from
            <br />muscles to mothers' milk, are at the
            <br />other end of the complexity scale:
            <br />Built on long, kinky backbones of
            <br />molecules called amino acids,
            <br />proteins can comprise more than
            <br />10,000 atoms apiece.
            <br />   The key to how any protein works
            <br />is its three-dimensional shape,
            <br />determined by all the ways its atoms
            <br />interact. Trying to push two atoms
            <br />closer when they want to repel is like
            <br />holding magnets together when
            <br />they're oriented the wrong way. You
            <br />can force them, but nature prefers
            <br />configurations that follow the path of
            <br />least resistance. In a simple molecule,
            <br />that path is pretty clear: WaterH 2
            <br />Ois hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen
            <br />balanced perfectly in a V-shape at a
            <br />104.4-degree angle. This push and
            <br />pull is inevitable. Physics is destiny.
            <br />The Challenge
            <br />   The online game Foldit is designed
            <br />to reveal the shortcuts nature uses to
            <br />weave a tangle of amino acids, like
            <br />the one shown here, into a protein.
            <br />Players click to move pieces around
            <br />until they fit.
            <br />   But the bigger the molecule, the
            <br />more complex these negotiations
            <br />become. And proteins are colossal.
            <br />Of course, there is another way to
            <br />figure all this out: Shining x-rays
            <br />through a crystallized lump of
            <br />protein can help reveal the exact
            <br />position of its folded-up atoms. But
            <br />that takes time just 50,000 protein
            <br />structures have been cracked since
            <br />the late 1950s, while the sequences
            <br />of millions of protein-coding genes
            <br />have been discovered in the past 10
            <br />years alone. To make headway in
            <br />figuring out what all these proteins
            <br />do, scientists need a faster approach.
            <br />   So why not just do the math?
            <br />Calculate the energy of all the
            <br />different ways a given protein can be
            <br />folded and find the most efficient.
            <br />Bang: You're done.
            <br />   But no. Scientists can only estimate
            <br />the total energy for a molecule as big
            <br />as a protein, and that's not accurate
            <br />enough to predict its structure. Even
            <br />worse, there are more ways to fold a
            <br />protein than there are atoms in the
            <br />universe. It's like a combination lock
            <br />with 1,000 dials. Yet proteins fold
            <br />themselves into shape in a fraction of
            <br />a second. No one knows how. Early
            <br />last year, CASP's organizers hit up
            <br />laboratories around the world to find
            <br />proteins whose structures were about
            <br />to be solved. From these they
            <br />compiled a list of more than 120
            <br />puzzles, which they started posting
            <br />on the CASP server in May.
            <br />   Popovi designed an interface for
            <br />Foldit that renders any protein as a
            <br />cartoon assemblage of spirals,
            <br />zigzags, squiggles, and geometric
            <br />loops. Every part of the protein is
            <br />movablepush two sheets together
            <br />and shimmering connectors
            <br />(representing hydrogen bonds) glue
            <br />them tight. Try to fit a loop into a
            <br />hole that's too small and red stars
            <br />flash at the collision sites. A &quot;wiggle&quot;
            <br />shakes an entire chunk of the
            <br />structure to try to get pieces to settle,
            <br />like dry pasta finding a more
            <br />compact formation in a jar. Add a
            <br />chat window and a score tally and
            <br />you've got yourself a game.
            <br />   The same day Foldit came out,
            <br />May 8, 2008, an article on the game
            <br />appeared in The Economist. The
            <br />ensuing surge of players swamped
            <br />the server. Working on test proteins
            <br />for which Baker already knew the
            <br />structures, folders quickly started to
            <br />make friends via the in-game chat
            <br />channel. They shared insights and
            <br />half-finished puzzles; teams
            <br />emerged, and collective efforts
            <br />proved far more successful than any
            <br />solo folder. A member of the leading
            <br />team named Jason Kuznicki (game
            <br />handle: Diderot) set up a wiki that
            <br />Popovi adopted as Foldit's official
            <br />manual. &quot;We even built a mini-
            <br />Facebook for them,&quot; he says.
            <br />   The friendly atmosphere drew
            <br />about 100 new players a day, and the
            <br />fierce competition among
            <br />teamsFreedom Folders, Richard
            <br />Dawkins Foundation, Folders for
            <br />Obamapushed everyone to keep
            <br />improving. In early June, Baker's
            <br />team released five CASP proteins to
            <br />the Foldit community and crossed
            <br />their fingers.
            <br />   Close to midnight on July 28 of last
            <br />year, Laurent de Jerphanio n (screen
            <br />name: Dejerpha) stared in disbelief at
            <br />the multicolored tangle floating on
            <br />his computer display. The 43-year-
            <br />old Paris-based marketing manager
            <br />had been working on puzzle T0461
            <br />for several long evenings. There
            <br />didn't seem to be any improvement
            <br />left to be made. He was cruising to
            <br />victory.
            <br />   Then he looked at the scoreboard.
            <br />He had been overtaken by a 13-year-
            <br />old American named Cheese. The kid
            <br />(real name: Aristides Poehlman) had
            <br />just accomplished an astonishing 20-
            <br />point jump in a single moveonly
            <br />an hour before the deadline. But de
            <br />Jerphanion didn't get to be one of the
            <br />best Foldit players in the world
            <br />without grit. &quot;  nous deux
            <br />maintenant,&quot; he muttered. Bring it
            <br />on.
            <br />   On the other side of the world,
            <br />around 7 pm in Virginia, the
            <br />Poehlman household was in an
            <br />uproar. Cheese's parents were
            <br />folding, too, on computers upstairs.
            <br />Upon her son's great leap forward,
            <br />Athena, his mother, typed &quot;Wow!
            <br />Way to go!&quot; into the Foldit global
            <br />chat window. More encouragement
            <br />rolled in from the rest of his
            <br />teamAnother Hour, Another
            <br />Pointscattered worldwide. But
            <br />within minutes, de Jerphanion had
            <br />made more progress on the puzzle
            <br />and pulled ahead by a point. It was
            <br />anyone's game.
            <br />   Poehlman's version of the protein
            <br />looked good. Too good, he thought.
            <br />No way was he going to make
            <br />another 20-point jump. That had
            <br />come from a drastic rebuild of a
            <br />deeply buried amino acid loopa
            <br />risky move. He forced himself to
            <br />focus on smaller tweaks. He marked
            <br />two spots on the backbone and
            <br />clicked an onscreen button to execute
            <br />a wiggle followed by a sidechain
            <br />shake. The section of amino acids
            <br />shivered like a wet dog, but his score
            <br />didn't budge.
            <br />   Meanwhile, in Paris, de Jerphanion
            <br />rotated his version of the protein and
            <br />peered at its innards. One solid
            <br />improvement would make him
            <br />unbeatable. He grabbed a loop and
            <br />nudged it into a gap but pushed too
            <br />hard. The protein exploded into a
            <br />Christmas tree of alarms and warning
            <br />lights, amino acids colliding. He
            <br />undid the move.
            <br />   Poehlman, too, was trying to
            <br />squeeze out another point. He spun
            <br />the protein around and eyed a loop
            <br />dangling from the end of the largest
            <br />helix. In pull mode, he guided it
            <br />along the protein's flank and did
            <br />another wiggle. The program updated
            <br />his score. Poehlman banged out a
            <br />message to his team: &quot;I just pulled
            <br />ahead by 1 pt.&quot;
            <br />   With just a minute to go,
            <br />Poehlman's parents came downstairs
            <br />to find their son pacing back and
            <br />forth in front of his computer, biting
            <br />his nails with a mouth full of braces.
            <br />He knew that de Jerphanion could
            <br />snipe him at any moment.
            <br />   Then the clock ran out. Poehlman
            <br />danced and hooted while his three-
            <br />dimensional protein structure
            <br />uploaded to Baker's server.
            <br />   At 9:40 am an announcement came
            <br />over the microphone. &quot;Is anyone
            <br />from the Baker group here?&quot; Three
            <br />hundred scientists looked around the
            <br />ballroom. Outside, a cold December
            <br />wind blustered under a slate-gray
            <br />sky, but the Hotel Setar Palace, near
            <br />Cagliari, Sardinia, was warmand
            <br />tense. As it did every two years, the
            <br />CASP community had gathered for
            <br />the results.
            <br />   The overall scores had just been
            <br />posted on the Web, and the whole
            <br />room was beating up the hotel Wi-Fi
            <br />to get a look. To determine the tally
            <br />for each puzzle, CASP judges used a
            <br />formula that compared the guesses
            <br />against experimentally measured
            <br />data. In the no-holds-barred series, in
            <br />which competitors can use human
            <br />brains, computers, and anything else
            <br />to solve the puzzles, Baker's team got
            <br />the highest score in the hardest
            <br />category, where the puzzles don't
            <br />look like any known proteins.
            <br />Everyone pretty much expected that.
            <br />But the question remained: Had
            <br />Foldit players contributed any of the
            <br />winning puzzles?
            <br />   Two of Baker's PhD students,
            <br />James Thompson and Robert
            <br />Vernon, groggy from a sleepless
            <br />night and months of relentless CASP
            <br />work, finally arrived with the answer.
            <br />After a brief wrestle with a laptop,
            <br />they loaded their results. Of the 15
            <br />Foldit solutions that Baker submitted
            <br />to CASP, seven had finished in the
            <br />moneyall of them folded by
            <br />Poehlman and his teammates. One of
            <br />their solutions even took first place.
            <br />A band of gamer nonscientists had
            <br />beaten the best biochemists.
            <br />   Arguably, though, the real Foldit
            <br />victory had come a few months
            <br />earlier. The 
            <br />creators of the game
            <br />invited the top players to Seattle,
            <br />seeking their help in making the app
            <br />better. Popovi contacted Poehlman's
            <br />parents. The kid was shocked.
            <br />&quot;Aristides didn't believe us until we
            <br />showed him the email,&quot; his mother
            <br />says. &quot;The silent stare he gave us was
            <br />priceless.&quot; Poehlman and his dad,
            <br />Louis, flew into Seattle late; they
            <br />played Foldit for hours in their hotel
            <br />before going to bedjust like at
            <br />home.
            <br />   At UW's computer lab, Popovi and
            <br />his grad students filmed the
            <br />Poehlmans playing Foldit and
            <br />interviewed them about their
            <br />techniques. Louis was exacting in his
            <br />analysis of how he approached each
            <br />puzzle, supplying sophisticated

            <br />By Gethin Chamberlain (World
            <br />news | guardian.co.uk)

            <br />  &quot;To put that into context, normal
            <br />seasonal flu probably affects around
            <br />10% of the world's population every
            <br />year, so we are heading for a flu
            <br />season which is perhaps three times
            <br />worse than usual  not allowing for
            <br />whether this virus is more severe
            <br />than normal seasonal flu viruses.&quot;
            <br />   The study, which was published in
            <br />the journal, estimated contagiousness
            <br />of the disease by analysing the
            <br />number of people travelling to
            <br />Mexico who became infected, and
            <br />comparing that with the study of a
            <br />Mexican village where the disease
            <br />has spread. The research also
            <br />examined how the virus was
            <br />mutating.
            <br />   It estimated that swine flu had
            <br />killed between 0.4% and 1.4% of its
            <br />victims in Mexico. Lead author
            <br />Christophe Fraser said it was too
            <br />early to predict what the death rate
            <br />was likely to be outside Mexico.
            <br />  &quot;My hunch is that the death rate will
            <br />be lower elsewhere  Mexico has
            <br />underlying issues with respiratory
            <br />disease,&quot; he said.
            <br />   The researchers said this H1N1
            <br />virus appears to be about equal in
            <br />severity to the flu of 1957, and less
            <br />severe than the deadly 1918 version.
            <br />  &quot;At the moment the virus is not
            <br />spreading fast in the northern
            <br />hemisphere because we are outside
            <br />the normal flu season, but come the
            <br />autumn it is likely to cause a really
            <br />major epidemic,&quot; Ferguson said.
            <br />   He declined to put an estimate on
            <br />the number of deaths that may occur.
            <br />  &quot;We have some assessment, but the
            <br />uncertainty is still quite broad,&quot; he
            <br />said. &quot;We can say it is not going to be
            <br />as catastrophic as the Spanish flu
            <br />pandemic of 1918, it is milder than
            <br />that.
            <br />  &quot;But it is still possible it could be
            <br />[like] 1957  where about three to
            <br />four out of 1,000 people who were
            <br />infected died and overall about 3
            <br />million to 4 million people died that
            <br />year because of the pandemic
            <br />worldwide  or it could be even
            <br />milder than that, like the 1968
            <br />pandemic which was barely worse
            <br />than a normal seasonal flu year.&quot;
            <br />  &quot;I am not predicting three million to
            <br />four million [deaths]. That was what
            <br />happened in 1957. The world is a
            <br />very different place today. There are
            <br />more people in the world, but there is
            <br />also a much better healthcare system.
            <br />We have drugs and vaccines,
            <br />particularly in developed countries,
            <br />which should markedly reduce the
            <br />burdens of the disease.&quot;
            <br />   Ferguson said the findings of the
            <br />study confirmed that decisions must
            <br />be taken swiftly on vaccine
            <br />production.
            <br />  &quot;One of the key decisions which has
            <br />to be made this week by the world
            <br />community is how much do we
            <br />switch over current vaccine
            <br />production for seasonal flu to make a
            <br />vaccine against this particular virus?&quot;
            <br />   Today Cuba and Thailand
            <br />confirmed their first case of the virus.
            <br />The patient in Cuban is a Mexican
            <br />student attending a Cuban medical
            <br />school.
            <br />   At least 61 people have been killed
            <br />by swine flu around the world, and
            <br />the WHO has confirmed about 4,800
            <br />cases.
            <br />   Fidel Castro accused Mexico of
            <br />failing to disclose the spread of swine
            <br />flu until after Barack Obama had
            <br />visited the country on 16 April. In a
            <br />newspaper column, the former Cuban
            <br />leader wrote: &quot;Mexican authorities
            <br />did not inform the world of the
            <br />presence [of swine flu], while they
            <br />waited for Obama's visit.&quot;

            <br />   At least 47 people were killed
            <br />today and more than 50 injured when

            <br />treating casualties of the fighting in
            <br />north-eastern Sri Lanka.
            <br />   A doctor working in the hospital
            <br />said the shell appeared to have been
            <br />fired from government positions. The
            <br />UN described the attack as a war
            <br />crime.
            <br />   The attack was confirmed by two

            <br />working in the hospital, set up in
            <br />Mullaivaikal East primary school.
            <br />The Sri Lankan military has denied

            <br />   According to the Sri Lankan

            <br />Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
            <br />(LTTE).
            <br />   The UN estimates that between
            <br />50,000 and 100,000 civilians remain
            <br />trapped inside the tiny pocket of
            <br />land.
            <br />   Medical staff said this morning's
            <br />attack happened at 7.30am local time
            <br />(0200 BST), when a single shell
            <br />landed on the admissions ward.
            <br />   Dr V Shanmugarajah told the
            <br />Guardian 47 people were killed and
            <br />56 were injured. The dead included a
            <br />member of the medical staff and two
            <br />volunteers.
            <br />   A second doctor, Dr Thurairaja
            <br />Varatharajah, the government-
            <br />appointed regional health director for
            <br />Mullaitivu, put the death toll at 49,
            <br />and said it was expected to rise.
            <br />   A UN official in Colombo said the
            <br />fighting was clearly continuing
            <br />despite concerns expressed by the
            <br />UN secretary general last night. The
            <br />official said of the attack on the
            <br />hospital: &quot;It is clearly a war crime.&quot;
            <br />   The Sri Lankan military said this
            <br />morning its infantry had crossed an
            <br />earth barrier constructed by the
            <br />Tigers, and that after the initial
            <br />thrust, special forces moved in and
            <br />wiped out the remaining rebel
            <br />fighters in the area. The military said
            <br />its troops had advanced a further 300
            <br />metres.
            <br />   The UN yesterday condemned
            <br />attacks in Sri Lanka as a
            <br />&quot;bloodbath&quot;after days of heavy
            <br />shelling killed hundreds of civilians
            <br />trapped in the war zone. Colombo
            <br />has denied using artillery or aircraft,
            <br />and accused the Tigers of using
            <br />mortars to fire on civilians for
            <br />propaganda purposes. There is no
            <br />way of verifying any of the claims or
            <br />casualty figures, because independent
            <br />journalists are denied access to the
            <br />conflict zone.

            <br />Tonight's episode didn't have to be
            <br />two hours. I already suffered from
            <br />watching a three-hour finale of The
            <br />Celebrity Apprentice, and when I
            <br />saw the show start with a
            <br />professional group dance, I knew this
            <br />episode was going to be padded. That
            <br />three-minute buffer of dancing could
            <br />be worse; Samantha Harris could
            <br />have tried to interview the celebrities
            <br />for three minutes.
            <br />   I caught Samantha Harris this
            <br />afternoon on the syndicated version
            <br />of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?,
            <br />covering for Meredith Vieira, and she
            <br />was a little better on that show. I
            <br />have to think that she just can't roll
            <br />with the punches as well as Tom
            <br />Bergeron. Her flaws really kicked in
            <br />tonight as she fumbled through the
            <br />whole show. Can't we have a contest
            <br />to find a new co-host?

            <br />  Earlier today we wrote about the
            <br />new version of the Times Reader
            <br />desktop app, notable for swapping
            <br />out Microsoft's Silverlight
            <br />technology for Adobe's AIR platform
            <br />- a significant win for Adobe over its
            <br />RIA (Rich Internet Apps) rival. The
            <br />New York Times has followed up by
            <br />debuting another online news reading
            <br />product. This one is called Times
            <br />Wire and it aims to be a real time
            <br />'river of news', taking a large leaf
            <br />from the book of Twitter and
            <br />Friendfeed. The site is described as
            <br />&quot;a new layout of New York Times
            <br />news in reserve chronological order.&quot;
            <br />It updates every minute with the
            <br />latest news and blog posts from
            <br />across NYTimes.com.
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   Times Wire readers can choose to
            <br />view the full stream of content from
            <br />across the site or just the Business &amp;
            <br />Technology section. More
            <br />interestingly, and much like
            <br />FriendFeed, users can customize
            <br />their view from their favorite
            <br />sections and blogs. Times Wire also
            <br />features a photo gallery, displaying
            <br />the latest news in pictures.
            <br />   Times Wire is the first NYT
            <br />product built with its own Newswire
            <br />API. The product will be officially
            <br />launching tomorrow with a tab on the
            <br />NYT homepage, but you can see it in
            <br />action now.
            <br />   Times Wire is a useful new product
            <br />and shows that the NYT is actively
            <br />tapping into two big trends on the
            <br />Web currently: real time information
            <br />and personalization. The 'river of
            <br />news' format isn't as overwhelming
            <br />as it is on the new FriendFeed page,
            <br />where a torrent of content will scroll
            <br />past the bewildered user in the blink
            <br />of an eye. I blinked a lot of times
            <br />over the course of a couple of
            <br />minutes before I saw an update to the
            <br />'All News' section in Times Wire.
            <br />This is probably a good thing for a
            <br />news site, because people need at
            <br />least a bit of time to digest news.
            <br />   The New York Times is proving
            <br />itself to be a leader among the big
            <br />newspapers in not only keeping up
            <br />with the latest Internet trends, but
            <br />sometimes extending them. This
            <br />particular product probably won't be
            <br />hugely useful for the general public,
            <br />it seems more like a product that info
            <br />junkies (like bloggers) and
            <br />newshounds would enjoy. But it's
            <br />definitely a worthwhile experiment.

            <br />  Today, Amazon finally released an
            <br />iPhone-specific version of its Kindle
            <br />eBook store, which makes it a lot
            <br />easier to browse and buy books while
            <br />on the go. Sadly, though, Amazon
            <br />did not release a new version of the
            <br />Kindle app with a built-in browser
            <br />(yet). So users are still being kicked
            <br />out of the iPhone app and taken to
            <br />Safari in order to browse the store
            <br />and complete transactions. A button
            <br />that takes users back to the Kindle
            <br />app only appears after a purchase in
            <br />Safari has been completed.
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   The iPhone-optimized site is
            <br />basically just an eBook-specific
            <br />version of Amazon's regular mobile
            <br />site. Except for the ability to send
            <br />eBook purchases to your mobile
            <br />devices - the Kindle and the iPhone -
            <br />nothing really sets the iPhone Kindle
            <br />store apart from the rest of Amazon's
            <br />mobile site. The mobile site itself is
            <br />quite well done and makes it easy to
            <br />browse and buy books (or anything
            <br />else that Amazon sells for that
            <br />matter).
            <br />   Conflict with Apple?
            <br />   A lot of the discussion around the
            <br />new iPhone optimized Kindle store
            <br />currently focuses on the fact that
            <br />Apple, with the upcoming iPhone 3.0
            <br />OS update, will make it easy for
            <br />developers to charge for transactions
            <br />from within a specific app.
            <br />Obviously, eBooks would be one of
            <br />the many areas where developers
            <br />could not only make good use of this
            <br />capability, but where Apple could
            <br />also get a nice 30% cut from every
            <br />transaction. By going through the
            <br />web, Amazon can bypass Apple
            <br />completely. What About Stanza?
            <br />   What will be more interesting to
            <br />see, though, is if Amazon will also
            <br />start to integrate some of the
            <br />technology it acquired when it
            <br />bought Stanza last month. Stanza
            <br />already featured the ability to browse
            <br />books without ever having to leave
            <br />the app, though the final transactions
            <br />were also handled on the sellers'
            <br />websites. Before the acquisition,
            <br />Stanza had also been working with
            <br />Adobe to create a standard for online
            <br />book catalogs, based on Stanza's own
            <br />specifications, and we hope that the
            <br />Stanza team will continue this work
            <br />under Amazon and maybe the next
            <br />version of the Kindle app will
            <br />integrate some of this work. Discuss
            <br />  Filed under: Analysis / Opinion,
            <br />Hardware, Software It was one of
            <br />those slow weekends. A good time, I
            <br />thought, to clean up some odds and
            <br />ends on my to-do list. Often, my list
            <br />involves things relating to my
            <br />computers, and this weekend was no
            <br />exception.
            <br />   Item #1. Install Windows 7 RC1
            <br />using VMWare. I didn't have a super
            <br />urgent reason for doing so, but the
            <br />time seemed right. I went to the
            <br />Windows 7 download site, followed
            <br />the instructions and the download
            <br />never started. Just an animated
            <br />thingy. I assumed the Microsoft
            <br />Servers were busy, so just let it go. A
            <br />few minutes passed. The thingy kept
            <br />spinning. Finally, after an hour I said
            <br />the hell with it. Oh, I wasn't just
            <br />staring at the screen for an hour. I
            <br />DID have other things to do.
            <br />   I tried again later in the day. I
            <br />thought, well, maybe this download
            <br />is really popular, but it has been out
            <br />for a few days, and certainly
            <br />Microsoft has plenty of bandwidth. I
            <br />tried a few tests downloads of other
            <br />things, and everything was peachy.
            <br />   Just for the heck of it, I tried
            <br />downloading the RC with Firefox.
            <br />Blam! It started right away. I'm sure
            <br />other people know this, but a quick
            <br />Google didn't give me any obvious
            <br />joy. For whatever reason, Safari just
            <br />won't connect. A subtle message
            <br />from MS? Or just one of those
            <br />things? Anyway, save yourself some
            <br />frustration, and use Firefox. It just
            <br />works. (Note: there were some
            <br />comments about this in Steve's
            <br />Windows 7 post)

            <br />   In the aftermath (heh heh) of the
            <br />bass-heavy Beats by Dre Studio
            <br />headphones, Monster decided to pack
            <br />the Doctor's finicky sound quality
            <br />specs into two tiny earbuds.
            <br />Naturally, audiophiles (including
            <br />myself) were skeptical. Sure the
            <br />Beats suffered from shoddy
            <br />construction and fell apart after a few
            <br />months of ownership, but they also
            <br />provided some of the best bass we've
            <br />ever heard in a set of cans.
            <br />   Sure enough, the bass response
            <br />from these things is rich and full. The
            <br />lowest frequencies rumble with a
            <br />force akin to the thud of a decent
            <br />subwoofer. Keep in mind these are
            <br />not miniaturized 12-inch Kickers
            <br />designed to blow your eardrums out.
            <br />But for a device that is essentially a
            <br />tiny speaker with no auxiliary power,
            <br />they're superb  especially when
            <br />compared to the white earcruds doled
            <br />out by Apple with every iDevice.
            <br />   WIRED Excellent all-around
            <br />frequency definition and particularly
            <br />impressive bass response. Monsters

            <br />   TIRED The bright red cable is
            <br />slightly ostentatious. Peak bass only
            <br />hits at earwax shattering volumes.

            <br />   It's not quite a netbook, not quite an

            <br />depressing tradeoffs to achieve those
            <br />scores. Battery life is three hours, 40
            <br />minutes (22 percent longer than the

            <br />But there are tradeoffs with going

            <br />   The Rockets needed no such

            <br />87, on Sunday. Houston led by
            <br />double figures all game, thanks to

            <br />second-teamers who were pressed
            <br />into action by injuries to the teams
            <br />stars  Yao Ming, wholl miss the
            <br />rest of the playoffs with a broken
            <br />foot, is the most recent casualty 
            <br />and big-name backups. Jonathan
            <br />Feigen of the Houston Chronicle
            <br />offers an appreciation of six-foot,
            <br />160-pound point guard Aaron
            <br />Brooks, who shouldered a Yao-sized
            <br />load on Sunday and scorched the
            <br />Lakers for 34 points.
            <br />   Perhaps equally surprising was the
            <br />23-point eruption from Houstons
            <br />dedicated defense/intangible
            <br />specialist, Shane Battier. If someone
            <br />had claimed that Rockets forward
            <br />Shane Battier would outscore Los
            <br />Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant
            <br />in Game 4 of the Western

            <br />game in this series  such a
            <br />statement probably would have been
            <br />met with laughter, the Chronicles
            <br />Sam Khan Jr. notes. The win  and
            <br />Battiers 23-to-15 scoring edge over
            <br />Kobe  was a needed salve for
            <br />Rockets fans who saw their star
            <br />centers season end with foot
            <br />problems, again, but theres still
            <br />plenty of reason for Yao-related
            <br />anxiety, Harvey Araton writes in the
            <br />New York Times.
            <br />   After riding a brilliant effort from
            <br />Dirk Nowitzki to a near-win on
            <br />Saturday, the Mavericks found
            <br />themselves 106-105 losers and down
            <br />3-0 in the series, victims of the most
            <br />infamous non-call of the playoffs.
            <br />Carmelo Anthony sank a game-
            <br />winning three-pointer after a pair of
            <br />meant-to-be-intentional fouls from
            <br />Mavericks forward Antoine Wright
            <br />went un-whistled. While the NBA
            <br />apologized for the missed call a mere
            <br />three hours after the game, the
            <br />Mavericks received little sympathy
            <br />from Bradford Doolittle of
            <br />Basketball Prospectus, who thinks
            <br />Wright shouldve been a little more
            <br />obvious about his intentions. Was it
            <br />a foul? Maybe. Probably. But not
            <br />definitely, Doolittle writes. When
            <br />youre giving a foul, give it. In the
            <br />Dallas Morning News, Jean-Jacques
            <br />Taylor wonders if the Mavs can get
            <br />past being hosed to pick up a

            <br />Vancouver-Carolina Stanley Cup
            <br />Final, the highest-profile series of the

            <br />have a chance at wrapping up a six-
            <br />game series win tonight. While
            <br />Ovechkin found himself in the

            <br />-knee hit on Pens center defenseman
            <br />Sergei Gonchar that may have
            <br />knocked Gonchar out for the playoffs
            <br /> Jeff Z. Klein of the New York
            <br />Times situates the official response

            <br />willing to overlook a sketchy call or
            <br />two for a series with this much star
            <br />power.
            <br />  Maybe they arent the next Magic
            <br />Johnson and Larry Bird, who raised
            <br />the level of NBA prominence and
            <br />prosperity in the 1980s, Mariotti
            <br />writes. But in a hockey context,
            <br />Ovechkin and Crosby are luring
            <br />more eyeballs back to a sport that
            <br />went flat among the American
            <br />masses for 20 years.

            <br />the end of the Southern 500, when 50

            <br />for a second time  and first since
            <br />1993. It was a big win for Martin, but
            <br />Jay Hart of Yahoo Sports thinks the
            <br />bigger story only begins with the
            <br />racer who was first to the checkered
            <br />flag. All four of the other racers in
            <br />the top five were, like Martin, driving
            <br />for Rick Hendrick.

            <br />Motorsports is doing now, Hart
            <br />writes. Its not just that Hendrick is
            <br />better. Thats been on display

            <br />Johnson has cruised to each of the
            <br />last three titles. Its the separation.
            <br />Since 2006, Hendrick has won 38
            <br />races. The closest challenger is
            <br />Roush, who has won 26 with five
            <br />cars to Hendricks four.

            <br />   The hiring of Chuck Daly  who
            <br />died Saturday at age 78  as the
            <br />head coach of the New Jersey Nets
            <br />was a watershed in your Fixers
            <br />adolescence. Here, miraculously and
            <br />inexplicably, was the perennially
            <br />benighted, mockery-magnet team
            <br />from my home state bringing in a
            <br />coach whod won two championships
            <br />with the Detroit Pistons and brought
            <br />home Olympic gold as coach of the
            <br />1992 Dream Team. His Garden State
            <br />tenure lasted just two years, and he
            <br />never got the Nets out of the first
            <br />round of the playoffs, but I remember
            <br />loving Daly, both for the fleeting
            <br />prestige he lent the organization and
            <br />because he seemed, despite a closet
            <br />full of really sharp suits and those
            <br />two championship rings, a strangely
            <br />perfect fit for New Jersey. In a lovely
            <br />eulogy in the Detroit Free Press,
            <br />Mitch Albom proves that it wasnt
            <br />just this Nets-crazed Jersey kid who
            <br />saw Daly as that most oxymoronic of
            <br />figures: everyday royalty.
            <br />  He wasnt a former NBA or college
            <br />star, Albom writes. He actually
            <br />worked real jobs before becoming a
            <br />coach: a dishwasher, a bouncer, a
            <br />grunt in a lime pit, slapping leather
            <br />hides. He knew there was a bottom as
            <br />well as a top, and he would tell me
            <br />that were all just a snap away from
            <br />going back, here then gone. I think
            <br />he coached that way, with a shadow
            <br />behind him, the shadow of normalcy.
            <br />He won in the NBA and he won in
            <br />the Olympics and we called him
            <br />Daddy Rich but he always laughed
            <br />at that. He was Chuck from
            <br />Punxsutawney, the son of a
            <br />salesman, a child of the Depression.

            <br />which is the season 2 finale, kind of
            <br />blew my mind. Sheldon is almost a
            <br />real boy! Not only was he able to
            <br />correctly identify emotions not once,
            <br />but twice, but he has started pulling
            <br />honest-to-goodness pranks. Funny
            <br />ones, at that! The whole bedtime
            <br />conversation between he and
            <br />Leonard about Penny wanting him
            <br />carnally? You know that wouldn't
            <br />have happened a year ago.
            <br />   Speaking of Penny, there was one
            <br />glaring thing about this otherwise
            <br />enjoyable episode -- she was
            <br />practically non-existent! Granted, she
            <br />played a big role in the over-arching
            <br />storyline if not the episodic one, but
            <br />nonetheless, her absence was
            <br />definitely noticeable.

            <br />  (S05E24) If you've been watching
            <br />House for any serious length of time,
            <br />you know that things are never what
            <br />they seem. And, moreover, if you've
            <br />seen any of the previous season
            <br />finales of the show, you know that
            <br />there are major fireworks in store.
            <br />Going off the precedent set by last
            <br />season's gut wrenching two-parter,
            <br />&quot;House's Head&quot; and &quot;Wilson's
            <br />Heart&quot;, I was expecting a killer
            <br />episode. So, for the first 30 minutes, I
            <br />kept wondering when we were
            <br />getting to the good stuff. After the
            <br />final 10 minutes? Well, I reserve the
            <br />right to change my mind, but after
            <br />first viewing, it feels like a rotten bait
            <br />and switch. Follow me after the jump
            <br />for the big reveal.

            <br />received a rough-cut copy of
            <br />HIMYM's season finale. I was all
            <br />giddy and wanted to pop it in the
            <br />DVD player right away, but I wanted
            <br />to wait until I saw tonight's episode
            <br />first, figuring it would set up the
            <br />finale, as it did in past seasons. This
            <br />episode does so, at least a little bit.
            <br />But the most important part of the
            <br />story -- the results of Ted's chance
            <br />meeting with Stella on that street
            <br />corner -- was at once disappointing

            <br />  Part New Tech, part Tech Set, all
            <br />Southern California, the Twiistup
            <br />events are a product of the rampantly
            <br />blossoming Los Angeles tech scene.
            <br />They combine an admixture of micro
            <br />- and mainstream celebrity with
            <br />Hollywood production values in over
            <br />-the-top glam settings for photo
            <br />opportunities any tech hipster would
            <br />die for.
            <br />   Mike Macadaan started Twiistup
            <br />two years ago when he was a
            <br />UX/design creative executive at
            <br />AOL. When he moved from NorCal
            <br />to SoCal, he started the event to
            <br />make friends and networking
            <br />connections, not planning on
            <br />growing the event beyond the initial
            <br />two instances. Instead of just
            <br />concocting another mixer, he added a
            <br />few twists, and Twiistup gained
            <br />popularity and a hundred or so
            <br />attendees with each occurrence.
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />  &quot;With Twiistup 4, he said 'Screw it.
            <br />I'm gonna go big.' He bought out the
            <br />whole pool at the Viceroy he had a
            <br />room full of 80s arcade games - it
            <br />was a technology carnival,&quot; said
            <br />newly hired event producer Francisco
            <br />Dao.

            <br />  &quot;Conferences are boring as sh*t, but
            <br />Twiistup was just this party. He sold
            <br />600 tickets and had 600 people on
            <br />the waiting list. At at that point,
            <br />Twiistup became L.A.'s flagship
            <br />event. Twiistup 5 this February was
            <br />held in a hangar in the Santa Monica
            <br />airport, all decked out in this
            <br />cyberpunk, Blade Runner kind of
            <br />thing. Mike had 1,000 people with a
            <br />400-person waiting list. He really
            <br />never planned for it to be this big. It's
            <br />too big and valuable to just stop, but
            <br />it also became too big for Mike to
            <br />take it to the next level.&quot;
            <br />   Enter Dao, a &quot;funemployed&quot; SoCal
            <br />entrepreneur, author, and blogger.
            <br />  &quot;It's a natural fit when you learn
            <br />that, in a former life, he was both a
            <br />standup comic and life coach,&quot; wrote
            <br />Sean Percival of Dao in today's
            <br />installment of LaLaWag.
            <br />  &quot;Tired of having to make a scene at
            <br />other people's events, Francisco
            <br />started to arrange his own unique
            <br />series of fun-inspired get-togethers.
            <br />Rumor has it he may even make a
            <br />career out of it, bringing you a new
            <br />type of tech event, with a twist.&quot;
            <br />   Hint, hint.
            <br />   So when silent investors bought the
            <br />brand, Dao was brought on board. He
            <br />is raising the stakes by making
            <br />Twiistup 6 a two-day event. He's
            <br />thinking of it as &quot;a mini-TED&quot; with
            <br />an evening party and a all-day stage
            <br />event the following day. Already,
            <br />Dao has secured several tech and
            <br />mainstream persons of note as
            <br />speakers.

            <br />   Twiistup is already known for its
            <br />New Tech-esque &quot;Showoff&quot;
            <br />competition and signature evening
            <br />event; the addition of a full
            <br />conference agenda and the seeding of
            <br />similar event models in other cities
            <br />are two immediate enhancements
            <br />announced with the influx of new
            <br />capital.
            <br />  &quot;The groundswell of community
            <br />support for Twiistup in other states,
            <br />let alone Los Angeles, has been
            <br />incredible to watch and it's the
            <br />driving reason Twiistup's reputation
            <br />has spread so far and wide,&quot; said
            <br />Macadaan. &quot;People from New York,
            <br />Colorado, Miami, Seattle, Atlanta,
            <br />Chicago, and even Switzerland have
            <br />reached out wanting to create a
            <br />similar experience to help bring their
            <br />communities together. I'm thrilled
            <br />that Twiistup will get the dedicated
            <br />time and focus it needs to become
            <br />bigger and even better.&quot;
            <br />   There have also been suggestions
            <br />that Twiistup should be a regional
            <br />event with national reach, such as
            <br />South by Southwest. &quot;It should be on
            <br />the level of Blogwold, TechCrunch
            <br />50, a young and hip tech show,&quot; said
            <br />Dao. &quot;The one thing I'm sure about is
            <br />that Twiistup is going to be a lot
            <br />bigger.&quot;
            <br />   The next Twiistup will take place
            <br />July 30-31 at the Universal Hilton in
            <br />Universal City, Los Angeles. Discuss
            <br />  With a name like SocialMedia.com,
            <br />it had better be good - right? The
            <br />company called SocialMedia is
            <br />launching a number of new
            <br />advertising products today and they
            <br />beg a question that could be
            <br />fundamental to the financial viability
            <br />of this new online world - do people
            <br />want to talk about products and be
            <br />active participants in advertising
            <br />campaigns? We're not sure how we
            <br />feel about this idea and we're curious
            <br />about your perspective.
            <br />   SocialMedia.com has raised
            <br />millions of dollars in financing and
            <br />says it's seen excellent results in
            <br />previous campaigns on Facebook and
            <br />other social networks. Now it's going
            <br />to bring its strategy to Twitter,
            <br />dedicated microsites and elsewhere
            <br />around the web. The strategy is
            <br />essentially to track, highlight and
            <br />prompt casual conversations online
            <br />about an advertiser's product. Do you
            <br />want to be part of those kinds of
            <br />conversations?
            <br />   Sponsor
            <br />   Social Media's Nick Gonzalez says
            <br />the company's previous campaigns
            <br />have been found to &quot;increase
            <br />purchasing intent 6% over standard
            <br />digital campaigns and in target
            <br />audiences that went up to 13% over
            <br />standard digital campaigns.&quot; Those
            <br />campaigns asked users of things like
            <br />Facebook applications what they
            <br />thought about a product, then shared
            <br />the answers out with respondents'
            <br />friend networks on Facebook.
            <br />   Do you want to talk and listen to
            <br />other people talk about products
            <br />online at the prompting of
            <br />advertisers?( poll)
            <br />   Now the company is going to roll
            <br />out a service that tracks Twitter
            <br />mentions of a company, product or
            <br />keyword. The discovered search
            <br />results will be filterable, can be
            <br />limited to a particular group of users,
            <br />and can then be displayed in a widget
            <br />or microsite. For an additional fee
            <br />SocialMedia will purchase ads in
            <br />popular Twitter clients that prompt
            <br />users to Tweet about an advertiser.
            <br />Twitter users don't get paid for doing
            <br />so, they just get the opportunity to
            <br />offer public feedback, perhaps with a
            <br />common hashtag so all the related
            <br />tweets can be viewed publicly with
            <br />ease. We can imagine people going
            <br />for that. RSS readers can click here
            <br />to participate in a poll on this topic
            <br />and view the results.
            <br />   Other new products being rolled
            <br />out today include branded
            <br />embeddable polls and activity stream
            <br />publishing microsites that will
            <br />function a little like Twitter but will
            <br />stand alone on an advertiser's site.
            <br />This doesn't sound terribly
            <br />complicated and in fact sounds like it
            <br />could work quite well. But will you
            <br />welcome these kinds of
            <br />conversations into your social media
            <br />experience? The &quot;your friend is a fan
            <br />of this product&quot; ads on Facebook are
            <br />a touch creepy already. Are you
            <br />ready to see this paradigm proliferate
            <br />through the work of companies like
            <br />this?
            <br />  &quot;I came here to talk about my
            <br />thoughts, feelings and experiences
            <br />with friends and a global network of
            <br />diverse people - and you want me to
            <br />write about your product?&quot; Discuss

            <br />the cast of Step by Step would've
            <br />sworn was never possible way back
            <br />when, but eASIC is far from
            <br />satisfied. To that end, it's introducing
            <br />a new H.264 codec aimed to bring
            <br />high-def capabilities to all manners
            <br />of devices, including (but certainly
            <br />not limited to) toys, baby monitors,
            <br />public transportation, wireless video
            <br />surveillance and wireless webcams.
            <br />The highly integrated eDV9200 is
            <br />said to &quot;dramatically lower the cost
            <br />of entry into the high-definition
            <br />video market, enabling a new class of
            <br />low-cost applications to fully
            <br />leverage the benefits offered by HD
            <br />technology.&quot; Best of all, these guys
            <br />aren't just blowing smoke, as the chip
            <br />-- which captures streaming data
            <br />directly from a CMOS sensor,
            <br />compresses it, and transfers it to a
            <br />host system or to a variety of storage
            <br />devices -- is priced at just $4.99 each
            <br />in volume. HD oven timers, here we

            <br />  And here we go again, with yet
            <br />another post about the troubled
            <br />business of the newspapers, but this
            <br />time I've got three separate articles
            <br />that, combined, give a pretty good
            <br />explanation for why the newspaper
            <br />business has been in trouble.
            <br />Basically, the newspapers failed to
            <br />innovate, they failed to engage with
            <br />their communities -- and worst of all,
            <br />they failed to actually do much
            <br />reporting.
            <br />   First up is Frank Rich's column on
            <br />how the American mainstream press
            <br />is on &quot;suicide watch.&quot; He does a
            <br />decent job describing the problem, in
            <br />discussing the industry's fear (or
            <br />outright disgust) towards any sort of
            <br />innovation, while others did the
            <br />innovating for them. He compares
            <br />how the newspapers have acted to
            <br />how the movie studios acted when
            <br />TV first became popular.
            <br />   But... then, he falls into the same
            <br />old fallacy. Assuming that those who
            <br />are talking about new models mean
            <br />&quot;citizen journalists&quot; with no business
            <br />model: Reporting the news can be
            <br />expensive. Some of it -- monitoring
            <br />the local school board, say -- can and
            <br />is being done by voluntary &quot;citizen
            <br />journalists&quot; with time on their hands,
            <br />integrity and a Web site. But we can't
            <br />have serious opinions about
            <br />America's role in combating the
            <br />Taliban in Pakistan unless brave and
            <br />knowledgeable correspondents (with
            <br />security to protect them) tell us in
            <br />real time what is actually going on
            <br />there. We can't know what is
            <br />happening behind closed doors at
            <br />corrupt, hard-to-penetrate institutions
            <br />in Washington or Wall Street unless
            <br />teams of reporters armed with the
            <br />appropriate technical expertise and
            <br />assiduously developed contacts are
            <br />digging night and day. Those
            <br />reporters have to eat and pay rent,
            <br />whether they work for print, a TV
            <br />network, a Web operation or some
            <br />new bottom-up news organism we
            <br />can't yet imagine. Indeed. But no one
            <br />has ever said otherwise. No one has
            <br />said that &quot;unpaid&quot; reporters will
            <br />replace all of the paid ones. We're
            <br />just saying that the paid reporters
            <br />may end up doing their jobs in a
            <br />different way and getting paid via
            <br />other business models. And, Rich
            <br />also seems to be underestimating the
            <br />ability of the people who are already
            <br />in those places to be a part of the
            <br />journalism process -- not necessarily
            <br />the core component of it, but
            <br />certainly a part of it.
            <br />   The second article worth reading is
            <br />Robert Niles discussion of how the
            <br />ruling in the 1995 lawsuit Stratton
            <br />Okamont v. Prodigy scared
            <br />newspapers away from engaging in
            <br />online conversations. The ruling
            <br />effectively found Prodigy liable for
            <br />anonymous comments on its message
            <br />board because it had hired a
            <br />moderator for those boards. While
            <br />the passage of the CDA the following
            <br />year -- and specifically section 230 of
            <br />the CDA granting safe harbors --
            <br />effectively erased that decision, &quot;risk
            <br />averse&quot; newspaper feared to actually
            <br />engage with readers in comments or
            <br />forums for fear that it would
            <br />suddenly make them liable for the
            <br />content written by the community.
            <br />Thus, they ignored their own
            <br />communities and did little to really
            <br />interact with them.
            <br />   The final piece may be the most
            <br />interesting. Walter Pincus talks about
            <br />how so many newspaper reporters
            <br />have stopped reporting and really
            <br />started repeating the messages being
            <br />handed to them. For all the talk of
            <br />&quot;investigative reporting,&quot; there's very
            <br />little of that being done. Most
            <br />reporting isn't reporting. It's not
            <br />digging up the details and presenting
            <br />an informed piece that gets at the
            <br />facts. It's simply parroting what
            <br />someone told them, and then perhaps
            <br />presenting an alternate point of view
            <br />(what Jay Rosen has referred to as
            <br />&quot;he said, she said&quot; journalism)
            <br />without any effort whatsoever to
            <br />actually determine who's right. It's as
            <br />if journalists have figured that
            <br />&quot;balanced&quot; reporting is to present two
            <br />sides to any story, and then leave it
            <br />up to you to do the actual work.
            <br />Pincus seems to be one of the first
            <br />we've seen in this ongoing debate to
            <br />make the point that we've been
            <br />focusing on for a while: the
            <br />newspapers aren't adding value.
            <br />   Pincus also highlights another point
            <br />that we've mentioned, but which is
            <br />almost always ignored in these
            <br />discussions: the big newspapers put
            <br />themselves into massive debt over
            <br />the past two decades. Many are still
            <br />profitable, but not profitable enough
            <br />to service the debt. And when they
            <br />top that off by not innovating, not
            <br />engaging with their community
            <br />(which is their most valuable asset)
            <br />and not actually doing real reporting,
            <br />but just acting as stenographers, is it
            <br />really any surprise the business is
            <br />struggling?

            <br />back in 2003, wondering whether it
            <br />was really a violation of privacy for
            <br />police to put a GPS tracking device
            <br />on a suspect's car. In 2005, a court
            <br />said it was perfectly legal, though
            <br />there were concerns about what this
            <br />meant. We're seeing the same
            <br />concerns as another court has ruled
            <br />the same way. The reasoning and the
            <br />logic is effectively the same: if you
            <br />are traveling on public roads, anyone
            <br />could (theoretically) drive behind
            <br />you and see where you are going --
            <br />even without a warrant. So is it really
            <br />a violation of privacy if that tracking
            <br />is done by a little black box attached
            <br />to your car instead of a big black box
            <br />with four wheels?
            <br />   Of course, the flipside to that, is
            <br />that if you are driving you can also
            <br />see (for the most part) if there is
            <br />another car following you and that
            <br />other car cannot follow you onto
            <br />private property that you own. A
            <br />hidden GPS device is quite different
            <br />on those points. So while the courts
            <br />seem to be coming down on the side
            <br />of this not being a violation of
            <br />privacy, I can definitely see where
            <br />privacy advocates are troubled by
            <br />these rulings. The fact that they
            <br />effectively suggest the police can
            <br />simply put a hidden GPS device on
            <br />any car for no reason at all raises
            <br />plenty of questions -- especially in an
            <br />era when information can and is
            <br />regularly abused.

            <br />  Filed under: Bad Apple, iPhone,
            <br />App Store If it's Monday, there must
            <br />be a few more stories of iPhone apps
            <br />rejected for curious and spurious
            <br />reasons. Today's contenders are up to
            <br />the line... and away they go!
            <br />   First, it's Maza's Drivetrain app, a
            <br />remote control for the Transmission
            <br />client for Bittorrent running on the
            <br />user's computer. Rejected! In this
            <br />case, the reason is that Bittorrent is
            <br />sometimes used for the trading of
            <br />third-party copyrighted material.
            <br />Yeah, but... um... the iPhone app isn't
            <br />a torrent client at all, it's just a UI for
            <br />a client running elsewhere. How does
            <br />that make any kind of sense?
            <br />iLounge quotes the developer as
            <br />saying the rejection is &quot;ridiculous,&quot;
            <br />and it's hard to disagree.
            <br />   Second, if you've ever wanted to
            <br />replace the face of Jesus with your
            <br />own, well, you can't do it with an
            <br />iPhone app. SAI reports that the
            <br />developer of the previously-approved
            <br />Animalyzer(which let you replace
            <br />animal faces with your photos) has
            <br />gotten a rejection notice for the Me
            <br />So Holy app that extends the face-
            <br />replacement to religious figures.
            <br />Apple's justification for the rejection
            <br />is the catch-all &quot;objectionable
            <br />content&quot; clause 3.3.12 of the
            <br />developer agreement, which states
            <br />  &quot;Applications must not contain any
            <br />obscene, pornographic, offensive or
            <br />defamatory content or materials of
            <br />any kind (text, graphics, images,
            <br />photographs, etc.), or other content or
            <br />materials that in Apple's reasonable
            <br />judgement may be found
            <br />objectionable by iPhone or iPod
            <br />touch users.&quot;
            <br />   Could one reasonably judge that
            <br />some iPhone or iPod touch users
            <br />might object to an app that lets users
            <br />replace a divine visage with a
            <br />mugshot or LOLcat? Sure, they
            <br />might... but when an app that lets you
            <br />aim virtual urine at a toilet sails
            <br />through to the store without a hiccup,
            <br />'reasonable judgement' doesn't seem
            <br />to be a valid operating standard any
            <br />longer. There are hundreds (if not
            <br />thousands) of 'offensive' apps in the
            <br />store already -- but offending
            <br />religious sensibilities is clearly
            <br />different than grading feces.

            <br />   I reviewed the Village Tronic
            <br />ViDock a while back, and I was
            <br />happy to have the opportunity to take
            <br />a look at one of their more entry-
            <br />level solutions for adding additional
            <br />monitors to machines without an
            <br />additional video port. This one, the
            <br />ViBook, is a USB-to-DVI solution.
            <br />   As was the case with my previous
            <br />experience with Village Tronic
            <br />products, I was duly impressed by
            <br />their classy packaging. But I won't
            <br />dwell on the shell here (no more
            <br />rhyming, I mean it!). The device
            <br />itself is compact, well-engineered
            <br />and, yes, shiny. It connects to your
            <br />computer via a standard USB cable
            <br />plugged into any powered USB 2.0
            <br />slot.
            <br />   It's designed to connect in one of
            <br />several ways to the monitor: directly
            <br />attached to the monitor's video port
            <br />via a compact male-to-male adapter,
            <br />via a cable directly connected to its
            <br />embedded female adapter, or -- in a
            <br />related manner -- via a short cable
            <br />with the body of the device semi-
            <br />permanently mounted on the back of
            <br />the monitor with the included cradle
            <br />and 3M adhesive pads. It's designed
            <br />well enough that no matter where
            <br />you put it, it will fit nicely and stay
            <br />put (it has a studded rubber base,
            <br />too). It is, by the way, both Mac and
            <br />PC compatible. Read on for the rest
            <br />of the review ...

            <br />airing of World War II specials
            <br />(many of featuring, well, Hitler).
            <br />Perhaps they were thinking of that
            <br />reputation when they put together
            <br />their new slate of specials, which,
            <br />according to Broadcasting &amp; Cable,
            <br />includes specials hosted by Jon
            <br />Stewart and Lewis Black of The
            <br />Daily Show.
            <br />   Stewart will be given two hours
            <br />with which to target the immigration
            <br />issue in a special called The

            <br />economic implications of
            <br />immigration and its role in last year's
            <br />presidential campaign, there should
            <br />be plenty for Stewart to work with to
            <br />keep the special current. Stewart has
            <br />already begun work on it, according
            <br />to B&amp;C. The special will follow
            <br />eight people on the track to becoming
            <br />U.S. citizens. the special will air in

            <br />  Firefox users no longer have to
            <br />register with Mozilla to install an
            <br />experimental Firefox extension; now
            <br />it's just one click. So here's some low
            <br />-hassle ways to get cleaner reading,
            <br />new tab features, and other goodies.
            <br />   Note: Despite the one-click
            <br />registration process, these Firefox
            <br />extensions are still unapproved by
            <br />Firefox's maker, Mozilla, and require
            <br />the standard warning to use at your
            <br />own risk, because they're both
            <br />unofficial and not tested by as wide
            <br />an audience as for approved
            <br />extensions. Still, many experimental
            <br />extensions are often just in the queue
            <br />for approval, so it can be worth living
            <br />on the bleeding edge for a great new
            <br />add-on. Identify
            <br />   Are you a social snooper? Do you
            <br />like to (or, for your work, have to)
            <br />search out contact information and
            <br />related pages whenever you stumble
            <br />across a fairly intriguing person?
            <br />Identity does the leg work for you.
            <br />Hit Alt+I (that's an &quot;i,&quot; by the way)
            <br />on any home pageblog, Twitter
            <br />profile, Flickr stream, etc.and the
            <br />extension uses Google's Social Graph
            <br />API to crawl around that person's
            <br />inter-connected pages and return all
            <br />their links and any short bio
            <br />information they've posted.
            <br />Potentially stalker-iffic, but also a
            <br />cool tool for an increasingly inter-
            <br />connected web. TidyRead
            <br />   We showed you a bit of TidyRead's
            <br />smartphone-friendly bookmark
            <br />power last week, but its Firefox
            <br />extension could be a boon to anyone
            <br />who likes to, or would like to, do
            <br />some actual reading on their laptop
            <br />or desktopif it weren't for all those
            <br />ads, compressed, off-font text, and
            <br />other distraction. TidyRead's
            <br />extension doesn't require any clicks
            <br />or keyboard shortcuts once you get it
            <br />going. Its &quot;Smart Mode&quot;
            <br />automatically converts any page with
            <br />a centrally-focused block of text into
            <br />a more readable format, from which
            <br />you can modify the font, size, and
            <br />margins (or go with what you set in
            <br />TidyRead's defaults). There's also an
            <br />&quot;Allow List&quot; and &quot;Block List,&quot; if you
            <br />just want, say, the Washington Post
            <br />and New Yorker to show up in more
            <br />readable fashion, while letting Perez
            <br />Hilton be as splashy/trashy as he
            <br />wants. Desktop
            <br />   Until Mozilla makes their
            <br />functional New Tab Page final in
            <br />Firefox 3.5, anyone who wants
            <br />something more than a blank
            <br />background or a home page on their
            <br />new tabs has do a little DIY
            <br />configuration. Desktop lets you do
            <br />exactly that, adding web page
            <br />thumbnails, search boxes right from
            <br />your installed search bar plug-ins, or
            <br />even file links and previews from
            <br />your own desktop. Everything's
            <br />either a &quot;widget,&quot; a &quot;search,&quot; or a
            <br />&quot;folder,&quot; but it seems open-ended
            <br />enough to inspire some pretty geeky
            <br />new tab designs. From our
            <br />rudimentary tests, it also seems to
            <br />load pretty quickly, even with sites
            <br />like Gmail thumbnailed. Don't take

            <br />   WebReview
            <br />   Along the same lines of Desktop,
            <br />WebReview gives you a start page
            <br />that's a lot more functional than white
            <br />nothingness, but this one's a lot more
            <br />automated. Tracking your browsing
            <br />habits and site history (without
            <br />reporting anything back over the net),
            <br />WebReview gives you four
            <br />categories of links on every new tab
            <br />page: Recently Closed, Most Visited,
            <br />Visited Daily, and Proposals for
            <br />Today. The first three are kind of self
            <br />-explanatory (and Visited Daily is a
            <br />neat little psychological hack), but
            <br />Proposals for Today is the neatest
            <br />one. It looks at your browsing history
            <br />across weekdays, weekends, and
            <br />other date data, and figures out that if
            <br />you, for instance, only head over to
            <br />BoingBoing on weekends, well, it's
            <br />Saturday, so here's a link.
            <br />WebReview also offers actual charts,
            <br />graphs, and organizational charts
            <br />showing how you usually get from
            <br />one page to another. If you've ever
            <br />wanted to know way more about how
            <br />you spend your time online, this
            <br />here's the extension for you.
            <br />   Got an experimental extension
            <br />that's worth the beta-test burden? By
            <br />all means, tell us about it in the
            <br />comments, and tell us what you think
            <br />of this batch as well.
            <br />  All platforms ( Adobe AIR): You
            <br />can't accuse the New York Times of
            <br />not trying something new. Their
            <br />latest product, Times Reader v2, puts
            <br />the skim-friendly powers of print into
            <br />an Adobe Air desktop window.
            <br />   The app is similar in layout to the
            <br />previously mentioned Article
            <br />Skimmer, using more of a screen's
            <br />horizontal space to lay out the front
            <br />page and various news sections. A
            <br />previous version used Microsoft's
            <br />Silverlight platform to achieve a
            <br />similar effect, but v2 is an Adobe
            <br />AIR release that seems to run well on
            <br />any computer that can run, for
            <br />instance, TweetDeck.
            <br />   The big, notable difference is that,
            <br />while the Article Skimmer is free on
            <br />every click, and leads you to the

            <br />  Pontiff due to give mass in Garden
            <br />of Gethsemane as his pilgrimage in
            <br />the Holy Land continues
            <br />   Pope Benedict XVI was visiting
            <br />some of the most important religious
            <br />sites in Jerusalem's Old City today on
            <br />the second day of his pilgrimage in
            <br />the Holy Land.
            <br />   He began at the Temple Mount or
            <br />Haram al-Sharif, which houses the
            <br />Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa
            <br />mosque, one of the holiest sites in
            <br />Islam. Then accompanied by Israel's
            <br />chief rabbis he saw the holiest site in
            <br />Judaism, the Western Wall. He was
            <br />to have meetings with the chief
            <br />rabbis before visiting the Cenacle,
            <br />the apparent site of the Last Supper.
            <br />   Later today he will say a mass in
            <br />the Kidron Valley at the Garden of
            <br />Gethsemane, just outside the walls of
            <br />the Old City.
            <br />   The pope was publicly criticised
            <br />yesterday, at the start of his visit, for
            <br />not going far enough in his
            <br />condemnation of the Holocaust in a
            <br />remembrance service at Yad
            <br />Vashem, Israel's official Holocaust
            <br />memorial.
            <br />   After landing in Tel Aviv, Benedict
            <br />had delivered a speech calling for the
            <br />creation of a Palestinian &quot;homeland&quot;,
            <br />but also speaking out against
            <br />antisemitism, saying its continuance
            <br />across the world was &quot;totally
            <br />unacceptable&quot; and should be
            <br />combated.
            <br />  &quot;It is right and fitting that, during
            <br />my stay in Israel, I will have the
            <br />opportunity to honour the memory of
            <br />the 6 million Jewish victims of the
            <br />Shoah,&quot; he said, using the Hebrew
            <br />word for the Holocaust, &quot;and to pray
            <br />that humanity will never again
            <br />witness a crime of such magnitude.&quot;
            <br />   His comments seemed intended to
            <br />repair damage done this year when
            <br />he lifted the excommunication of
            <br />four bishops, including the Briton
            <br />Richard Williamson, who denied the
            <br />existence of the Nazi gas chambers.
            <br />The Holocaust is an issue that has
            <br />long divided Israel and the Vatican,
            <br />notably over the actions, or inactions,
            <br />of the second world war pope, Pius
            <br />XII.
            <br />   After meeting Shimon Peres,
            <br />Israel's president, the pope visited
            <br />Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. He did
            <br />not see the museum, where a photo
            <br />caption criticises Pius XII for not
            <br />speaking out against the Holocaust.
            <br />But he did attend a service at the hall
            <br />of remembrance, rekindling the
            <br />eternal flame. He laid a wreath of
            <br />flowers in yellow and white, the
            <br />papal colours, and prayed over a
            <br />stone slab beneath which are buried
            <br />the ashes of Holocaust victims.
            <br />   He told the audience the Catholic
            <br />church felt &quot;deep compassion&quot; for the
            <br />victims remembered at Yad Vashem.
            <br />&quot;They lost their lives but will never
            <br />lose their names,&quot; he said. &quot;May the
            <br />names of these victims never perish.
            <br />May their suffering never be denied,
            <br />belittled or forgotten.&quot; But he
            <br />avoided any reference to the church's
            <br />wartime history.
            <br />   Moments after the pope had left,
            <br />Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, chairman of
            <br />the Yad Vashem council, told Israeli
            <br />TV he was disappointed by the
            <br />speech. &quot;There certainly was no
            <br />apology expressed here,&quot; he said.
            <br />   Lau criticised the pope for not
            <br />specifically saying 6 million were
            <br />killed, though Benedict did use the
            <br />figure in his earlier speech. The rabbi
            <br />had made the same criticism of
            <br />Benedict's predecessor, John Paul II,
            <br />who spoke at Yad Vashem in 2000.
            <br />   Benedict, 82, is only the third pope
            <br />to visit the Holy Land, and the
            <br />Vatican only officially recognised
            <br />Israel in 1993; an agreement between
            <br />the two sides on property rights and
            <br />hugely valuable tax exemptions has
            <br />still not been implemented.
            <br />   An interfaith meeting the pope
            <br />attended on Monday night was
            <br />interrupted by a Muslim cleric,
            <br />Taysir Tamimi, who is also the
            <br />Palestinian chief justice. He gave an
            <br />angry, 10-minute speech in Arabic
            <br />criticising Israel and the &quot;oppression
            <br />of the Israeli occupation&quot;. Some in
            <br />the crowd tried to walk out, others
            <br />applauded.
            <br />   Tamimi had not been due to speak
            <br />at the meeting at the Notre Dame
            <br />centre in Jerusalem. The pope sat
            <br />through the speech and left shortly
            <br />afterwards.
            <br />   The papal spokesman, Father
            <br />Federico Lombardi, described the
            <br />intervention as &quot;a direct negation of
            <br />what a dialogue should be&quot;.
            <br />  &quot;We hope that such an incident will
            <br />not damage the mission of the pope
            <br />aiming at promoting peace and also
            <br />inter-religious dialogue, as he has
            <br />clearly affirmed in many occasions
            <br />during this pilgrimage,&quot; Lombardi
            <br />said.

            <br />is after Apple again, this time with a
            <br />30 second TV spot[YouTube link]
            <br />complaining about the costs of filling
            <br />an iPod, and what an absolute
            <br />bargain the Zune Pass is.
            <br />   Claiming that it would cost
            <br />$30,000US to fill a 120 gigabyte
            <br />iPod with music, and only 15 dollars
            <br />a month for a Zune pass, Microsoft
            <br />wants to make a point that in these
            <br />trying economic times, Microsoft
            <br />products make the most sense.
            <br />   Of course, a lot of the math here is
            <br />fuzzy, and if you stop buying the
            <br />Zune pass you lose all your music,
            <br />except for the ten tracks you get to
            <br />keep a month. It also doesn't address
            <br />how many people, like myself, use
            <br />their iPod. I have a large collection of
            <br />music on CD going back to the
            <br />1980's. I want it to be portable, and to
            <br />have in the car, so I rip the music in
            <br />iTunes, and it costs me nothing
            <br />additional to have about 500 CDs at
            <br />my beck and call.
            <br />   For a company as dominant as
            <br />Microsoft is, they seem plenty
            <br />worried about Apple. Of course, the
            <br />Zune hasn't exactly been a world
            <br />beating product, and who can forget
            <br />the little New Year's Day present
            <br />when a lot of Zunes simply expired?
            <br />   I give Microsoft props for trying. It
            <br />keeps the Apple fans riled up and on
            <br />their toes, and certainly choice is a
            <br />wonderful thing in consumer
            <br />electronics.

            <br />  Researchers claim if virus continues
            <br />spreading at current rate a pandemic
            <br />will hit the west next autumn
            <br />   The swine flu virus will infect a
            <br />third of the world's population if it
            <br />continues to spread at its current rate,
            <br />scientists warned today.
            <br />   In what the journal Science
            <br />describes as the &quot;first quick and dirty
            <br />analysis&quot; of swine flu, a study by
            <br />researchers at London's Imperial
            <br />College predicted the virus was
            <br />likely to cause an epidemic in the
            <br />northern hemisphere next autumn.
            <br />   One of the authors, the
            <br />epidemiologist and disease modeller
            <br />Neil Ferguson, who sits on the World
            <br />Health Organisation's emergency
            <br />committee for the outbreak, said the
            <br />virus had &quot;full pandemic potential&quot;.
            <br />   Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today
            <br />programme, he said: &quot;It is likely to
            <br />spread around the world in the next
            <br />six to nine months, and when it does
            <br />so, it will affect about one-third of
            <br />the world's population.
