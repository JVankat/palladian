<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>ZIMMERMAN, Chief Justice</u>:</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This matter comes before
us on the motion of Juvenile Court Judge Sharon P. McCully. Judge McCully
asked this court to reverse the Judicial Conduct Commission's ("the Commission")
order recommending that she be publicly reprimanded. The Commission found
that Judge McCully, in her official capacity as juvenile court judge, allowed
a litigant to submit a sworn affidavit signed by Judge McCully and containing
her opinions and conclusions on the ultimate issue in a judicial proceeding
then pending before a district court judge. The Commission found that this
conduct amounted to "conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice
which brings a judicial office into disrepute" under article VIII, section
13 of the Utah Constitution and section 78-7-28(1)(e) of the Utah Code.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Initially, Judge McCully
moved this court for summary disposition, arguing, first, that the Commission
failed to make required findings and, second, that the statute the Commission
found her to have violated is unconstitutionally vague and infringes her
right to freedom of speech. This court denied Judge McCully's motion for
summary disposition and subsequently considered additional evidence and
heard oral argument from both parties pursuant to its authority under article
VIII, section 13 of the Utah Constitution. We affirm.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We begin by stating the appropriate
standard of review before presenting the parties' stipulated facts and
the Commission's findings. In <u>In re Worthen</u>, we determined the applicable
standard of review for judicial conduct cases:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>[W]e will not overturn
the Commission's findings of fact unless they are arbitrary, capricious,
or plainly in error, but we reserve the right to draw inferences from the
basic facts which may differ from the Commission's inferences and grant
no deference to the Commission's ultimate decision as to what constitutes
an appropriate sanction.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>926 P.2d 853, 865 (Utah 1996).
In this case, the parties stipulated to the following facts:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>1. At the direction
of the Utah Legislature in 1993, a general audit of the foster care system
in Utah was undertaken. As part of that audit, the Legislative Auditor
. . . asked Third District Juvenile Court Guardian ad litem David E. Littlefield,
Esq. . . . to provide records relating to Littlefield's services as guardian
ad litem in juvenile court, including records on individual children whom
Littlefield represented as guardian ad litem.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>2. Littlefield declined to
produce the requested records on the grounds that they were confidential
or privileged. The Auditor did not agree that the records were confidential
or privileged and caused a legislative subpoena to be issued and served
on Littlefield. In response . . . Littlefield filed a motion to quash the
legislative subpoena in the Third Judicial District Court in a case . .
. assigned to Judge Homer F. Wilkinson.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>3. The parties filed memoranda
or trial briefs with the Third District Court in support of their positions
on Littlefield's motion to quash the legislative subpoena. Upon receiving
the memorandum from the Legislative General Counsel, Littlefield called
Judge McCully and expressed concern that the facts outlined in that memorandum
did not accurately reflect the role and function of a guardian ad litem
in juvenile court. Littlefield informed Judge McCully that he expected
to subpoena her to testify at the hearing on his motion to explain the
role and function of a guardian ad litem in juvenile court. Sometime later,
Littlefield told Judge McCully that all testimony at the hearing would
be presented by affidavit and requested her to prepare an affidavit to
explain the role and function of the guardian ad litem in juvenile court
and the expectations of juvenile court judges of a guardian ad litem when
appointed. Judge McCully prepared an affidavit and delivered it to Littlefield
in lieu of giving testimony under personal subpoena. . . . Littlefield
filed Judge McCully's affidavit with the court and used it at the hearing
to support his motion to quash the legislative subpoena.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>4. On August 6, 1993, Judge
Wilkinson granted Littlefield's motion to quash the legislative subpoena.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Legislative counsel later filed
a complaint with the Commission, challenging the propriety of Judge McCully's
submission of the affidavit. The Commission investigated the matter, held
a formal hearing, and issued its findings and conclusions. It found fault
with two statements in the affidavit that Judge McCully prepared and allowed
Littlefield to present to Judge Wilkinson. First, Judge McCully's affidavit
stated, "To allow a non-lawyer to perform [the] functions [of a Guardian
ad Litem] would be to allow the unauthorized practice of law." Second,
the affidavit stated, "The Guardian ad Litem would also be violating his
duties as an officer of the court if he allowed anyone to have access to
his attorney/client records with regard to his Guardian ad Litem appointment."
On the basis of these statements and testimony it received during a hearing
on this matter, the Commission found that Judge McCully had engaged in
"conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings a judicial
office into disrepute." <u>See</u> Utah Const. art. VIII, 13(5); Utah Code
Ann. 78-7-28(1)(e). The Commission recommended that Judge McCully be publicly
sanctioned for this conduct. Pursuant to our constitutional and statutory
authority, we must now review the Commission's findings and conclusion
and implement, modify, or reject the Commission's recommendation as to
sanction. <u>See</u> Utah Code Ann. 78-7-30(5)(a).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We begin our analysis with
a review of the requirements for finding that a judge has committed prejudicial
conduct, which we outlined in <u>Worthen</u>, 926 P.2d at 870-72. The statutory
language requires that the Commission find that a judge has engaged in
"conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the
judicial office into disrepute." In <u>Worthen</u>, we outlined the requirements
of this ground for judicial discipline in two parts: (i) "prejudicial conduct,"
which we defined to be unjudicial conduct committed in a judicial capacity
but without bad faith,<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup> where "unjudicial
conduct" is defined to be a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct;
and (ii) "disrepute," which we defined as conduct that would appear to
an objective observer to be prejudicial to public esteem for the judicial
office. <u>Id.</u> Although the Commission did not have the benefit of
our opinion in <u>Worthen</u> at the time it issued its opinion in this
case, the Commission's findings and conclusions indicate that it found
Judge McCully's conduct to meet both parts of the test.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>First, as to its finding
of "conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice," our definition
requires the Commission to find (i) that Judge McCully's conduct violated
the Code of Judicial Conduct, (ii) that it was committed in her judicial
capacity, and (iii) that it was not committed willfully, i.e., it was committed
without bad faith.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As to the first requirement
of this test, while the Commission's findings of fact and conclusions of
law did not ultimately contain reference to specific canons of the Code
of Judicial Conduct, the findings did, when taken in context, indicate
that the Commission found that Judge McCully's conduct violated the Code.
The language of the Commission's ultimate findings mirrored that of canon
3(B)(9).<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> Canon 3(B)(9) provides, "A judge
shall not, while a proceeding is pending or impending in any court, make
any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect its outcome
or impair its fairness . . . ." The Commission's ultimate finding closely
mirrors the language of this canon.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After hearing testimony of
several witnesses, the Commission found the facts to be that "[t]he Judges
of the Juvenile Court, including Judge McCully, were keenly interested
and concerned regarding the legislative auditor's attempt to inspect the
guardian ad litem's files." Given that interest in the outcome of the litigation
before Judge Wilkinson, and the plain language of the affidavit, the Commission
concluded that the statements in Judge McCully's affidavit were "at least
in part intended to influence Judge Wilkinson's ultimate decision, to-wit:
whether or not to quash the legislative subpoena." Therefore, the Commission
found that Judge McCully had acted inappropriately by "voluntarily offering
testimony . . . in [her] official capacity, where a purpose of the testimony
[was] to influence the outcome of the hearing, or lend the weight of [her]
judicial office to one side of the controversy." In the future, the Commission
should specifically link its findings with the individual canons of the
Code of Judicial Conduct as required by our decision in <u>Worthen</u>.
In this case, however, where that language was stricken before <u>Worthen</u>
was decided and at the behest of Judge McCully, the failure is not fatal.
Here, the language of the findings the Commission made closely mirrors
the language of canon 3(B)(9) and clearly indicates that the Commission
actually found Judge McCully's affidavit to violate that canon.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The second and third requirements
for a finding of "prejudicial conduct," i.e., that the conduct was committed
in the judge's official capacity but without bad faith, have also been
met. Judge McCully prepared her affidavit in her official capacity as a
juvenile court judge, specifically identifying herself as such in both
the caption and the text of the affidavit. Further, the Commission found
that Judge McCully's actions were not committed in bad faith. Instead,
the Commission found that "Judge McCully acted in good faith and with good
intentions." Thus, the Commission made the proper findings to support its
conclusion that Judge McCully's conduct was "prejudicial," as that term
is defined in <u>Worthen</u>.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Turning to the second prong
of the statutory test, the conduct complained of must appear to an objective
observer to be prejudicial to public esteem for the judicial office. In
this regard, the Commission found that Judge McCully's actions would cause
an objective observer to reach a conclusion that the judicial office was
being used to influence another judge and would bring the judicial office
into question. Further, such conduct would likely affect the general perception
of the impartiality of the proceedings. All of the foregoing brings the
judicial office into disrepute.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Thus, the Commission satisfied
the "disrepute" prong of the statutory test.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
These findings support the Commission's ultimate conclusion that Judge
McCully's conduct violated section 78-7-28(1)(e) of the Code.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Returning to the standard
of review, we can find nothing in any of the Commission's factual findings
to indicate that they are in any way arbitrary, capricious, or plainly
in error. To the contrary, the Commission's findings are well supported
by the evidence we have reviewed on the record. Further, we agree with
the Commission's inferences and its conclusion that Judge McCully's conduct
was prejudicial and did bring the judiciary into disrepute.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Before discussing Judge McCully's
constitutional arguments, we turn to the issue of the proper sanction.
The Commission is authorized to recommend removal, suspension, censure,
involuntary retirement, or public or private reprimand. Utah Code Ann.
78-7-28(1). As with the declining severity of the grounds for discipline,
<u>see</u> <u>Worthen</u>, 926 P.2d at 870, the sanctions available to
the Commission also appear in order of declining severity, removal being
the most severe. The statute does not dictate what factors the Commission
must consider in recommending a sanction. It does provide that the Commission
may not recommend a private reprimand once it has conducted a formal hearing.
Utah Code Ann. 78-7-30(4). Once the Commission has made its recommendation
as to sanction, this court must review the Commission's proceedings below
and enter an order implementing, modifying, or rejecting the Commission's
recommendation. <u>Id.</u> 78-7-30(5)(a).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We note that the Commission
has adopted guidelines for sanctions, gleaned from case law in other states.
Specifically, the Commission considers the following nonexclusive list
of factors:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>"(a) whether the
misconduct is an isolated instance or evidenced a pattern of conduct; (b)
the nature, extent and frequency of occurrence of the acts of misconduct;
(c) whether the misconduct occurred in or out of the courtroom; (d) whether
the misconduct occurred in the judge's official capacity or in his [or
her] private life; (e) whether the judge has acknowledged or recognized
that the acts occurred; (f) whether the judge has evidenced an effort to
change or modify his [or her] conduct; (g) the length of service on the
bench; (h) whether there have been prior complaints about this judge; (i)
the effect the misconduct has upon the integrity of and respect for the
judiciary; and (j) the extent to which the judge exploited his [or her]
position to satisfy his [or her] personal desires."</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>In re Blauvelt</u>, 801 P.2d
235, 240 (Wash. 1990) (quoting <u>In re Kaiser</u>, 759 P.2d 392, 400 (Wash.
1988) (additional citation omitted)) (adopted by Utah Judicial Conduct
Commission on February 7, 1996).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In this case, the Commission
recommended that Judge McCully be publicly reprimanded for her conduct.
Although the Commission did not specifically tie its findings to its own
guidelines regarding sanctions, nevertheless, its order clearly reflects
that it considered the guidelines and found some factors pointing in favor
of sanction but other factors mitigating against the more severe sanctions.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Commission found that
Judge McCully's conduct resulted from an error in judgment, and it was
concerned about her statement, made at the hearing before the Commission,
that if she were faced with a similar factual situation in the future,
she would follow the same course of action. The Commission found that a
public reprimand was necessary to correct Judge McCully, to guide other
judges, and to restore the public's faith in the high standards of integrity
expected from the judiciary. However, the Commission found the more severe
sanction of suspension or removal unnecessary because Judge McCully had
acted without malice or bad faith and was motivated solely by altruistic
concerns and a perceived need to protect the integrity of the juvenile
court. The Commission noted that Judge McCully's actions occurred in the
midst of constitutional tensions between the legislative and judicial branches
and that she had acted out of a good-faith but mistaken belief that her
actions were appropriate. The Commission also found that "Judge McCully's
conduct does not reflect adversely, in any way whatsoever, on her ability
to serve as a Juvenile Court Judge." While we would prefer that the Commission
be more specific in referencing its own guidelines and explaining the reasoning
it employed in reaching its recommendation as to sanction, we find that
the Commission's findings in this case are clear enough.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Finally, Judge McCully argues
that publicly reprimanding her for her conduct would violate both her right
to due process, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution, and her First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Judge
McCully first argues that the prejudicial conduct ground for judicial discipline
is unconstitutionally vague in that it does not give reasonable notice
to judges as to what conduct would be sanctionable. We reject this argument.
Due process requires, at a minimum, adequate and timely notice. <u>Worthen</u>,
926 P.2d at 876. While a statute may violate due process rights if it is
overly vague, "'[a] statute is not unconstitutionally vague if it is sufficiently
explicit to inform the ordinary reader what conduct is prohibited.'" <u>State
v. Frampton</u>, 737 P.2d 183, 192 (Utah 1987) (quoting <u>State v. Theobald</u>,
645 P.2d 50, 51 (Utah 1982)).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The statutory language "conduct
prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings a judicial office
into disrepute" is broad, but it is not so vague as to be without meaning.
For example, an average judge would understand that violation of the Code
of Judicial Conduct would fall within the meaning of "prejudicial conduct"
even absent our recent decision in <u>Worthen</u>. <u>See</u> 926 P.2d
at 868. As noted above, canon 3(B)(9) states that it is improper for a
judge to "make any public comment that might reasonably be expected to
affect [the] outcome" of a case before another court. Opining as to the
ultimate issue before another judge is a public comment that may be reasonably
expected to affect the outcome of that proceeding. <u>Cf.</u> <u>In re
Charge of Judicial Misconduct</u>, 47 F.3d 399, 400 (10th Cir. 1995) (criticizing
judge for holding news conference and commenting on case pending before
him); <u>Furey v. Commission on Judicial Performance</u>, 743 P.2d 919,
928 (Cal. 1987) (disciplining judge for writing letter to judge who was
replacing him on case from which he had been disqualified telling succeeding
judge that defendant had lied); <u>Gubler v. Commission on Judicial Performance</u>,
688 P.2d 551, 568 (Cal. 1984) (disciplining judge for writing note to court
commissioner regarding outcome of case from which judge had previously
been disqualified); <u>Roberts v. Commission on Judicial Performance</u>,
661 P.2d 1064, 1068-69 (Cal. 1983) (sanctioning trial judge for telephoning
presiding judge to discuss ruling with which trial judge disagreed, before
time for rehearing had expired). Indeed, here an intent to impact the outcome
can reasonably be inferred. Thus, a reasonable judge, reading the statutory
language and canon 3(B)(9) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, would be on
notice that the conduct in which Judge McCully engaged would violate both
the statute and the canon.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Analogously, the Utah Ethics
Advisory Committee has issued an opinion that it would violate canon 2(B)
for a judge to testify as an expert witness in a proceeding before another
judge. Utah Ethics Advisory Committee, Informal Op. No. 88-8 (Sept. 15,
1988). We do not hold that Judge McCully's conduct violated canon 2(B),
because neither we nor any other authority has addressed whether the fact
that the proceeding in question was between public entities (as discussed
by the dissent) makes any difference to the appropriateness of a judge's
giving opinion testimony. However, the fact that the Utah Ethics Advisory
Committee and other ethics advisory committees have held that such testimony
violates one of the canons informs our opinion that such testimony also
violates the prohibition in canon 3(B)(9) on publicly commenting on a case
in a way intended to influence the outcome. <u>See, e.g.</u>, American
Bar Association, Committee on Professional Ethics, Informal Op. No. 1311
(March 11, 1975) (finding it improper for court to take part in cause where
it would become or appear to be advocate for either side); Arizona Judicial
Ethics Advisory Committee, Op. No. 90-1 (March 12, 1990) (holding that
providing affidavit to one party in legal malpractice action is giving
opinion testimony favoring one side and creates appearance of partiality);
Louisiana Supreme Court Committee on Judicial Ethics, Op. No. 119 (July
6, 1994) (holding judge's rendering opinion testimony ethically impermissible,
as it violates canon 2(B) of Code of Judicial Conduct by creating appearance
of partiality and lending prestige of office to advance private interest
of another); Washington Ethics Advisory Committee, Op. No. 85-4 (May 3,
1985) (distinguishing between providing subpoenaed factual testimony in
legal malpractice action and providing opinion testimony and finding opinion
testimony unethical under canon 2(B)). A judge seeking guidance on whether
submitting opinion testimony in another court would be ethical would find
numerous ethics advisory opinions holding that such testimony would be
improper.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Most importantly, Judge McCully
acknowledged in her answer to the Commission's formal notice that she understood
she was being charged with a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.
The Code of Judicial Conduct and ethics advisory opinions from this state,
the ABA, and other states all make clear that it is ethically improper
for a judge to give opinion testimony in a case pending in another court.
All these sources give meaning to the statutory language "conduct prejudicial
to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into
disrepute." Because she had adequate notice that her conduct could be subject
to discipline, Judge McCully's due process rights were not violated.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Judge McCully next argues
that any reading of the statute that defines her conduct as "prejudicial"
would violate her right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment
to the United States Constitution. The right to freedom of speech is not
absolute. In this case, Judge McCully voluntarily assumed the office of
judge and, as such, is bound by the Code of Judicial Conduct and other
laws governing judicial conduct. Many provisions of that Code restrict
her right to free speech. It would be absurd to hold that a person cannot,
by taking a public position of trust, subject herself to sanctions for
exercising her right to freedom of speech in a manner that is inconsistent
with her sworn duties of office. In this case, there are no prior restraints.
Judge McCully was free to exercise her speech rights, subject to the disciplinary
machinery in place to handle violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As a final note, we observe
that Judge McCully's conduct, while a technical violation of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, occurred in the context of a political confrontation
between the legislature and the department of human services' division
of child and family services, a confrontation that the juvenile court judges
were drawn into and, in effect, took sides in with the best of intentions.
This does not, however, excuse Judge McCully's conduct. As the United States
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted in <u>In re Charge of Judicial
Misconduct</u>, 47 F.3d at 400:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A judge should be
above the fray; he or she should not . . . appear to be caught up in or
contribute to [] public clamor. When a judge becomes embroiled in a controversy,
the line between the judge and the controversy . . . becomes blurred .
. . .</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We therefore conclude that Judge
McCully should be publicly reprimanded for engaging in conduct prejudicial
to the administration of justice which brought a judicial office into disrepute
in violation of section 78-7-28(1)(e) of the Utah Code because she prepared
and allowed a litigant to submit an affidavit containing not only facts
regarding the operation of the juvenile courts, but also her opinion as
to the ultimate issue before the court in which the affidavit was submitted.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>

<p><a NAME="N_1_"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>1. "Prejudicial
conduct" also encompasses willful misconduct that was committed in bad
faith but that did not occur in office. <u>Worthen</u>, 926 P.2d at 871.
This part of the definition is not, however, at issue in this case.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>2. Ironically,
the original draft of the Commission's findings of fact and conclusions
of law included specific reference to canon 3(B)(9) of the Code of Judicial
Conduct, but upon Judge McCully's objection the Commission agreed to delete
that reference. In light of our <u>Worthen</u> opinion, this finding should
have been retained. However, the detailed language supporting a finding
that Judge McCully's conduct violated canon 3(B)(9) remained unchanged
in the opinion.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><a NAME="N_3_"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>3. Although
the dissent has "difficulty" with the Commission's finding as to whether
an objective observer would conclude that Judge McCully's actions brought
her judicial office into disrepute, this court is bound by the standard
of review under which we may not overturn the Commission's factual finding
unless it is "arbitrary, capricious, or plainly in error." <u>Worthen</u>,
926 P.2d at 865.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><u>STEWART, Associate Chief
Justice, dissenting</u>:</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I respectfully dissent.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The majority opinion holds
that Judge McCully's action in this case amounted to "conduct prejudicial
to the administration of justice which brings a judicial office into dispute"
as that term is used in article VIII, section 13 of the Utah Constitution
and Utah Code Ann. 78-7-28(1)(e). I disagree.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>To make that showing, the
Commission must show that a judge's conduct violated the Code of Judicial
Conduct, in this case either canon 2(B) or canon 3(B)(9). Canon 2(B) states,
inter alia, that "a judge shall not lend the prestige of the judicial office
to advance the private interests of others." Canon 3(B)(9) states that
"a judge shall not, while a proceeding is pending or impending in any court,
make any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect its
outcome or impair its fairness."</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The conduct charged against
a judge must appear to an objective observer to be prejudicial to public
esteem for the judicial office. The Commission found that Judge McCully's
actions would cause an objective observer to reach a conclusion that the
official office was being used to influence another judge and would bring
the judicial office into question. Further, such conduct would likely affect
the general perception of the impartiality of the proceedings. All of the
foregoing brings the judicial office into disrepute.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The difficulty I have with
the Commission's findings is that they address Judge McCully's conduct
as if it had occurred in the ordinary adversarial-type proceeding between
two private parties or between the State and a person, as in a criminal
proceeding. That, however, was not the context in which her action should
be judged. Here, the legislative auditor was evaluating the merits of the
foster care program and the role of guardians ad litem, which the State
had established and funded in an effort to protect children's rights in
litigation which affected them.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Juvenile court judges were
intimately involved with the guardian ad litem program and the manner in
which the guardians function in relation to the children they represent.
The juvenile court judges undoubtedly had a better understanding of the
nature of that program than anyone else. Their views on the subject, and
in particular the relationship of the guardians ad litem to the children
they represent, should have been views of great importance to the legislative
auditor. That Judge Wilkinson was willing to consider those same views
therefore is not surprising. In this particular context, it was appropriate
for him to do so.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The majority expresses great
concern that the prestige of Judge McCully's office somehow improperly
influenced Judge Wilkinson's decision. While there may be circumstances
in which a testifying judge can have such an influence on a fact finder
(e.g., a lay jury), it is ludicrous to suggest that a district court judge
is such a wilting violet that he cannot objectively consider testimony
offered by a juvenile court judge concerning the affairs of her court when
the district court judge is called upon to examine issues of public concern
governing the operation of juvenile courts. District court judges are perfectly
capable of determining what constitutes competent evidence in such circumstances.
What we have here is a case concerning the admissibility of proffered evidence
that has been converted into a vehicle to impugn the integrity of a diligent
and conscientious judge.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When Judge McCully expressed
herself on the role of the guardian ad litem, she did so in the context
not of advancing the "<u>private interests of others</u>" in a <u>private</u>
proceeding, <u>see</u> canon 2(B), but rather in the context of a <u>public
legislative</u> inquiry into the efficacy of a program. In light of that,
it strikes me as being highly unrealistic to conclude that her conduct
"would bring the judicial office into question" in the view of an "objective
observer," as the Commission found. Furthermore, I find it far-fetched
to conclude that her conduct would "likely affect the general perception
of the impartiality of the proceedings," as the Commission found. In short,
I do not believe that what she did, even if a mistake, brought her "judicial
office into disrepute."</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The majority opinion acknowledges
that the context of a dispute between public entities over matters of public
concern has not been addressed in any ethics opinion of this Court, but
nevertheless cites to an informal opinion of the Utah Ethics Advisory Committee.
<u>See</u> Informal Op. 88-8 (Sept. 14, 1988). The opinion cited is wholly
irrelevant to the issues in this case, and the majority employs it to misstate
the law governing testimony offered by judges. The ethics opinion was expressly
limited to the question of whether an active judge could offer expert opinion
testimony on the issue of whether a settlement was reasonable. The opinion
concluded that because a judge typically has no special knowledge of the
factors underlying settlements, the only reason for calling a judge to
testify on such matters was the impermissible purpose of enhancing a litigant's
case by adorning it with the prestige of the judge's office.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>But that proposition has
nothing whatsoever to do with the facts of this case and canons 2(B) or
3(B)(9). In addition, it is incorrect to cite the informal ethics opinion
for the proposition, as the majority suggests, that it is <u>always</u>
impermissible for a judge to offer expert testimony. The opinion itself
implicitly assumes that there are instances when a judge may so testify.
Judges clearly can offer <u>factual</u> testimony in any proceeding over
which they are not personally presiding, as long as their testimony is
relevant and competent;<sup><a href="#N_1a_">(1)</a></sup> and with respect
to the question of <u>expert opinion</u> testimony, that must be decided
under the rules of evidence and the Code of Judicial Conduct.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Finally, I note that the
hearing before Judge Wilkinson on the motion to quash the legislative subpoena
was to be resolved initially at a hearing on the basis of live testimony.
Had Judge McCully been subpoenaed to appear, and had legislative counsel
deemed her appearance inappropriate at that point, counsel could then have
objected, Judge Wilkinson could have ruled at that point on the issue,
and this whole proceeding would have been avoided. Furthermore, when her
affidavit was submitted, after it was decided that the hearing could be
conducted on the basis of affidavits, it was a simple matter for the legislative
counsel to move to strike the affidavit so that the issue could have been
disposed of then and there. In either event, Judge Wilkinson's ruling could
have been appealed and the matter settled in the ordinary course of appellate
review, where the governing law could have been established in what is
a murky area of the law without sullying the reputation of a highly reputable
and very conscientious juvenile court judge.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
