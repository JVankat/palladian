Doomed plane's gaming system exposes holes in FAA oversight</a></b></big>
<br>Even on an airline famous for its service, Swissair's night flight from 
<br>New York to Geneva was something special.&#160; Flight 111 was dubbed 
<br>&#34;the U.N. shuttle&#34; for its popularity with United Nations officials, although 
<br>passenger lists regularly carried the names of prominent scientists,
<br>researchers and business executives, too.&#160; Hours after the jumbo jet 
<br>crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on Sept. 2, 1998, killing all 229 people 
<br>aboard, Canadian and U.S. aviation authorities zeroed in on something else 
<br>that was distinctive about Flight 111.&#160; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas" title="Go to article &#34;McDonnell Douglas&#34; in Wikipedia">McDonnell Douglas</a> MD-11 was
<br>one of only a few jets in the world with a pioneering interactive entertainment 
<br>system that let passengers select and watch movies on personal consoles, 
<br>shop and, on various international flights, use credit cards to play computer 
<br>casino games.&#160; Although the final accident report has not yet been released, 
<br>the Canadian government has considered the system's electronics as a 
<br>possible source of an electrical fire that may have caused the crash...
<br>Mlynarczyk says IFT's system was very rudimentary and unsuitable for
<br>aircraft use, but the company pressured him to accelerate the certification
<br>process.&#160; He says much work was needed before the equipment could pass
<br>FAA tests, including environmental and electromagnetic interference tests. 
<br>&#34;They had no clue what it would take to get an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Type_Certificate" title="Go to article &#34;Supplemental Type Certificate&#34; in Wikipedia">STC</a>,&#34; says Mlynarczyk.
<br>&#34;They would send some information about the system, and when we'd say,
<br>'That's not good enough,' they'd say, 'You're trying to gouge us for more 
<br>money.'&#160; They were running out of funds and trying to shortcut so many 
<br>things&#34;... In August 1997, the MD-11 jet that would later crash as 
<br>Swissair Flight 111 entered a hangar for a maintenance overhaul by Swissair 
<br>mechanics and an entertainment system installation by Hollingsead.
<br><span class="commentpopup" title="Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.">IFT</span> directors began leaving the company in the fall, a year before the crash...

<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2003-02-25-our-view_x.htm">
FAA failings in Swissair crash follow a too-familiar pattern</a> 
<br>...In all three tragedies, the FAA botched its paramount mission: 
<br>to make sure that those inspecting, maintaining and modifying 
<br>commercial airliners do their jobs properly... The Swissair crash 
<br>underscores the risks of further delay.&#160; USA Today reported 
<br>last week that the airline had fitted some of its planes with a 
<br>sophisticated entertainment system that let passengers watch 
<br>movies, shop and gamble.&#160; The FAA failed to oversee the
<br>installation, and problems later surfaced with both the system 
<br>and Santa Barbara Aerospace, the company that signed off on 
<br>the safety of the planes.&#160; Before the crash, the FAA repeatedly
<br>cited the firm for poor performance and even briefly suspended
<br>it while the entertainment system was being installed on Swissair 
<br>planes.&#160; Those concerns should have prompted the FAA to take 
<br>a closer look at the project.&#160; But it didn't.&#160; Swissair Flight 111 
<br>carried a system suspected of sparking a deadly electrical fire, 
<br>though an official cause has not yet been released.&#160; Only after 
<br>the crash did the FAA acknowledge risks with the system 
<br>and Santa Barbara Aerospace's procedures...

Crash report points to wiring</a>
<br>An electrical wiring problem was the most likely cause of a fire that
<br>caused Swissair Flight&#160;111 to crash into the Atlantic Ocean near Halifax,
<br>Nova Scotia, in&#160;1998, Canadian investigators said in a report Thursday...
<br>The entertainment system was made by a U.S. company, Interactive
<br>Flight Technologies.&#160; After the crash, Swissair disconnected the system
<br>from its planes and the Federal Aviation Administration, citing problems
<br>with its design, banned it from airliners...

Brian Carey: Swisscom should learn from Swissair crash</a>
<br>...The experience of Swissair, whose Icarus-like demise was caused by overexpansion, still chastens those who govern the cantons.&#160; And the parallels are not only valid, they are downright eery.&#160; Swissair was once known as the &#34;flying bank&#34;, such was its financial stability.&#160; The airline then decided to put itself at the centre of an alliance of smaller European airlines, taking stakes in Sabena and TAP and purchasing two regional French airlines.&#160; As a result of its &#34;hunter strategy&#34;, the small airline racked up huge borrowings, and in the wake of 9/11 collapsed under the strain.&#160; The airline was grounded on October&#160;2, and when the planes started flying again, pilots had to carry cash in satchels at the front of the plane to pay for fuel...

<br>Swissair/MDL-1269, in regards to an air crash near Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia.&#160; This Multi-district litigation, which is being overseen by the United States District Court for the Eastern Division of Pennsylvania, relates to the crash of Swissair Flight No.&#160;111 on September&#160;2, 1998.&#160; The aircraft involved in the crash was a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 equipped with an in-flight interactive entertainment system developed by the Interactive Entertainment Division that The Network Connection acquired from us.&#160; Since then, a number of claims have been filed by the families of the victims of the crash.&#160; We have been named as one of the many defendants, including Swissair, Boeing, DuPont and The Network Connection, in this consolidated multi-district litigation.&#160; Our aviation insurer is defending us in the action.&#160; We have $10&#160;million in insurance coverage related to the action.&#160; With respect to additional insurance coverage, a court has ruled that an umbrella policy for an additional $10&#160;million in insurance does not cover the Swissair action.&#160; Currently, we do not plan to appeal such ruling in connection with the Swissair crash.&#160; If liability is assessed against us, to the extent this liability exceeds the available insurance, our business will be adversely affected.&#160; If found liable for an amount substantially in excess of the limits of our coverage, we could lose all of our assets...

Doomed plane's gaming system exposes holes in FAA oversight</a></big>
<br>...Although the final accident report has not yet been released, the Canadian government has considered the system's electronics as a possible source of an electrical fire that may have caused the crash... Mlynarczyk says Interactive Flight Technologies' system was very rudimentary and unsuitable for aircraft use, but the company pressured him to accelerate the certification process.&#160; He says much work was needed before the equipment could pass FAA tests, including environmental and electromagnetic interference tests.&#160; &#34;They had no clue what it would take to get an STC,&#34; says Mlynarczyk.&#160; &#34;They would send some information about the system, and when we'd say, 'That's not good enough,' they'd say, 'You're trying to gouge us for more money.'&#160; They were running out of funds and trying to shortcut so many things&#34;...

Boeing Intervenes</a>
<br>Santa Barbara Aerospace Inc. hit more turbulence Friday in its bid to be acquired by a South Carolina-based company.&#160; Concerned that Santa Barbara Aerospace had a role in the September 1998 crash of a SwissAir passenger jet, aviation giant Boeing&#160;Co. convinced a bankruptcy court judge to delay the sale closing date by four days.&#160; In that time, Boeing investigators will be allowed to review Santa Barbara Aerospace's business records on the chance that they may find a &#34;smoking gun&#34; related to the air disaster off Nova Scotia.&#160; All 229&#160;passengers and crew members were killed in the crash.&#160; Boeing built the MD-11 airplane, but Santa Barbara Aerospace &#8211; an aircraft maintenance firm based at San Bernardino International Airport &#8211; issued a safety certificate for the plane's in-flight entertainment system.&#160; Faulty wiring in the entertainment system is a suspected cause of the crash.&#160; However, no official cause has been determined... As for the SwissAir investigation, the airline has already filed a complaint against Santa Barbara Aerospace and other companies involved in the manufacture and installation of the in-flight entertainment system.&#160; The system was built by Interactive Flight Technologies Inc. and installed by Hollingsead International.&#160; Santa Barbara Aerospace never actually had the plane at its hangar, but the firm reviewed documents pertaining to the entertainment system and issued a safety certificate stating that the work met standards set by the Federal Aviation dministration.&#160; The FAA routinely contracts out this type of work...

FAA failings in Swissair crash follow a too-familiar pattern</a>
<br>...USA Today reported last week that the airline had fitted some of its planes with a sophisticated entertainment system that let passengers watch movies, shop and gamble.&#160; The FAA failed to oversee the installation, and problems later surfaced with both the system and Santa Barbara Aerospace, the company that signed off on the safety of the planes.&#160; Before the crash, the FAA repeatedly cited the firm for poor performance and even briefly suspended it while the entertainment system was being installed on Swissair planes...

Crash report points to wiring</a>
<br>An electrical wiring problem was the most likely cause of a fire that caused Swissair Flight&#160;111 to crash into the Atlantic Ocean near Halifax, Nova Scotia, in&#160;1998, Canadian investigators said in a report Thursday... The entertainment system was made by a U.S. company, Interactive Flight Technologies.&#160; After the crash, Swissair disconnected the system from its planes and the Federal Aviation Administration, citing problems with its design, banned it from airliners... USA&#160;Today reported Feb.&#160;17 that the faulty systems were improperly installed and certified by contractors without adequate FAA oversight.&#160; The TSB said mistakes were made by contractors Hollingsead International and Santa Barbara Aerospace.&#160; Hollingsead employees did an electrical analysis for the entertainment system, even though they had no experience with MD-11 jets, the TSB said.&#160; Neither Santa Barbara, which certified the system met FAA safety standards, nor Hollingsead had staff members familiar enough with the MD-11's electrical design to judge whether the system was compatible, the TSB said...

<br>later, while over the US-Canadian border, something began to go terribly 
<br>wrong... By re-setting that circuit breaker he's re-energising that wire 
<br>bundle, that system, and essentially creating an arc track event that 
<br>can then melt down through succeeding bundles, knock out all his flight 
<br>control systems, his navigation systems etc, and bring down the aircraft...

Practical Advice on Wiring Maintenance Provided by Job Aid 1.0</a>
<br>...The recent mandate to inspect electrical wiring is of great 
<br>significance.&#160; For the first time in its history as a regulatory 
<br>authority, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has decreed 
<br>that wiring needs attention and continuous maintenance throughout 
<br>the life of the airplane... The regulation is an outgrowth of the 
<br>efforts of the Aging Transport Systems Rulemaking Advisory 
<br>Committee (ATSRAC), which determined that the state of wiring 
<br>on old aircraft (those with 20 or more years of service) was 
<br>deficient.&#160; Based on those findings, ATSRAC recommended wiring 
<br>inspections for the entire fleet of transport category aircraft...
<span class="comment87">
<br>Note by ICS:
<br>This article includes nine excellent photographs illustrating 
<br>various ways in which aricraft wiring can be damaged by careless 
<br>or incompetent installation.&#160; These photographs are of a much 
<br>better quality than any I've seen online provided by any other 
<br>organization &#8211; including those in the TSB Final Report 
<br>on the Swissair Flight 111 crash.

Agency Accuses Airline of Sloppy Maintenance 
<br>While Sidestepping Its Own Safety Oversight Shortcoming</a>
<br>...In the case of the Swissair MD-11, the Transportation Safety 
<br>Board (TSB) of Canada found that electrical arcing caused a 
<br>fire in the space above the ceiling in the forward passenger 
<br>cabin, which quickly became a runaway fire because of the 
<br>flammable materials in the area and the lack of fire detection 
<br>and suppression.&#160; The airplane crashed in Canadian waters...

Cargo Jet Fire Seems a Replay of Deadly Inferno</a>
<br>...The crew reported smoke and fire just to the rear of the cockpit. 
<br>It was sufficiently intense to force them to evacuate via a cockpit 
<br>window... Electrical arcing occurred in the process of powering up 
<br>the aircraft pursuant to engine start... The Airborne Express pilots 
<br>are luckier than the Swissair flight 111 pilots and passengers on 
<br>the night of 2 September 1998.&#160; All 229 aboard the MD-11 were killed 
<br>when a fire in the attic space above the forward galley, ignited by 
<br>arcing, sustained by flammable metalized mylar insulation blankets, 
<br>and reinforced by a burned-off end cap to an emergency oxygen line, 
<br>burned its way into the cockpit.&#160; Captain Urs Zimmerman was driven 
<br>out of his seat by molten globs of ceiling plastic falling on him, 
<br>and First Officer Stefan Loew was unable to maintain control of the 
<br>airplane in the night sky as the flight instrument screens blanked 
<br>out as a result of the progressive electrical failures triggered 
<br>by the fire...

The Tragic Legacy of Swissair Flight 111</a>
<br>...Someone had to speak out for all the senseless deaths and 
<br>the many families destroyed by the FAA's lack of attention to:
<br>&#8226;&#160; The hazards associated with specific aircraft wiring insulation types,
<br>snaked throughout the airliner and long known for their propensity to

Twelve Years of Half Measures</a>
<br>...While Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) has achieved 
<br>only about a 20% acceptance rate for its Swissair flight 111 
<br>recommendations, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board 
<br>(NTSB) may not have fared much better in its TWA flight 800 
<br>recommendations, even though a general comparison indicated 
<br>a 40% acceptance rate.&#160; The TSB's accounting is generous, and 
<br>even the one-in-five acceptance rate that it has attained in 
<br>the ten years since the Swissair disaster in Halifax may be 
<br>a stretch...&#160; A close reading of the voluminous correspondence 
<br>concerning the recommendations reveals a similar FAA pattern 
<br>of delay, partial measures, and outright obstructionism. 
<br>Part of the problem lies with the NTSB recommendations, which 
<br>strike one as duplicative, of secondary or tertiary importance, 
<br>or avoiding altogether the big issues &#8211; such as why fuel 
<br>tank inerting has not been required all along, and why flawed 
<br>electrical wiring insulation... has not been subject to 
<br>stringent risk analysis and maintenance protocols...

A New Mission in Life</a>&#160; CBC Broadcast Date: 22 December 2002
<br>When Lyn Romano lost her husband Ray in the Swissair&#160;111 crash, she channeled her grief into an ambitious project seeking to prevent similar tragedies.&#160; Using money obtained in a settlement from Swissair, Romano formed the International Aviation Safety Association (IASA) to improve aircraft safety and do the job she says the U.S.&#160;Federal Aviation Administration failed to do...

<a href="http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/menu/intro-3.htm">
A New Mission in Life</a>&#160; IASA Introduction
<br>On September 2nd 1998, Raymond M Romano boarded Swissair Flight&#160;111 at JFK&#160;Airport, New York on a scheduled flight to Geneva, Switzerland, with 214&#160;passengers and 14&#160;crewmembers.&#160; About 53&#160;minutes after departure, while cruising at flight level&#160;330, the flight crew smelled an abnormal odour in the cockpit.&#160; 13&#160;minutes later the aircraft's flight data recorder began to record a rapid succession of aircraft systems-related failures.&#160; The flight crew declared an emergency.&#160; One minute later, radio communications and secondary radar contact with the aircraft were lost, and the flight recorders stopped functioning.&#160; Five and a half minutes later, the aircraft crashed into the ocean about five nautical miles southwest of Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada.&#160; Raymond, together with the other two hundred and twenty eight people, was dead.&#160; It was against this tragic, horrific background that Raymond's wife, Lyn S Romano, formed the International Aviation Safety Association&#160;(IASA).&#160; IASA, a non-profit organization, was officially formed on March&#160;4th 1999, albeit the idea was conceived within weeks of the crash.&#160; A&#160;crash that in addition to the lives it abruptly and needlessly ended, has directly affected hundreds if not thousands of people.&#160; In Raymond's case, the crash robbed Lyn of a husband, three children of their father, a mother of her son, a sister of her brother, a mother-in-law of her son-in-law, a sister-in-law of her brother-in-law and so on.&#160; Then there were his friends, work colleagues and professional associates.&#160; The point is, aviation safety should never be considered in a vacuum; passengers are not the same as 'seat numbers' and when regulatory agencies speak in terms of 'perceived benefit' they should take stock of not only the lives lost in this and other tragedies but those left behind whose nights are plagued with nightmares and whose days are an ongoing battle to try to make some sort of sense of the loss they have suffered.&#160; This&#160;is&#160;why&#160;IASA&#160;was&#160;formed...

Fire in the Sky</a> ...Here the controversy begins.&#160; Instead of immediately heading for the nearest airport and landing, the pilot decided to go though his long checklist for smoke in the cabin.&#160; Precious minutes were lost.&#160; Nearly four and a half minutes after declaring smoke in the cockpit, Swissair&#160;111 was asked by Halifax Air Traffic Control to descend from twenty&#160;five thousand feet to three&#160;thousand...

<br>List of 50&#160;Reports from 1988 to 2001...
<br>This is a chronological list, with brief summaries, of reports of aircraft entertainment systems related events including significant system failures, smoke and/or fires.&#160; This list is by no means intended to represent all such events known but rather is an attempt to focus more clearly on those available... Of course aircraft systems should not emit smoke or cause fires because proper circuit design expressly is supposed to stop this... Critical to proper documentation of any such safety problems is the clear understanding of problems expressed through the most commonly used Databases made available to the public via the Internet...

Solve This One</a> ...Unfortunately, with electrics (in an electric jet), once things stop playing the game according to Hoyle you are in a world of hurt (and total confusion because it's literally beyond your experience and training).&#160; The MD11 was simply not designed for electrical cataclysms &#8211; yet that is precisely what happened.&#160; The failures were outside the parameters for which it was designed.&#160; That occurred courtesy of Kapton wiring, metallized mylar insulation, cost-cutting the third crewman, commercial pressure to incorporate the <span class="commentpopup" title="In-Flight Entertainment System">IFE</span>, poorly designed smoke-masks and goggles and a critical smk/elec switch designed by Nero.&#160; Of course the smoke checklist design philosophy should get a mention &#8211; but at the end of the day the battle was lost because of an initial human failure setting off a chain of seemingly distinct (but actually concerted) events...

Surveillance Cameras to Help Detect In-Flight Fires on Swissair Jets</a>
<br>...Vowing never again to lose an airplane to a runaway electrical fire in flight, Swissair is modifying its fleet of MD-11 aircraft to reduce the probability of a spreading conflagration and to improve its aircrews' ability to cope should such an emergency occur... These efforts are a direct outgrowth of the fatal September&#160;2, 1998 crash of a Swissair&#160;MD-11, Flight&#160;111 (SR111), at Halifax, Canada...  The accident struck the Swiss carrier like a gunshot.&#160; Concerned about a rising rate of incidents and non-routine occurrences, company officials were in the midst of corporate seminars addressing the need for improvements in safety management when the accident occurred. &#34;The participants were jolted away from the endless listing of cost problems, budget restrictions... punctuality reports and others by the explosive report of the hard and dramatic reality of an aircraft accident&#34;... The minutes of the company's last safety management seminar were dated September&#160;1, 1998, the very day before the accident...

<br>...The disastrous crash of Swissair Flight 111 on the night of Sept. 2, 1998, was not the result of a single damaged wire, a moment's lapse of judgment or a chance encounter with fate.&#160; Like so many disasters before it, the tragedy that claimed the lives of all 229&#160;people aboard the MD-11 jet was born of a chain of events and failures &#8211; all of them, ultimately, human.&#160; Aged and volatile electrical wiring.&#160; A taxing new inflight entertainment system.&#160; A fuselage lined with highly flammable insulation blankets.&#160; A veteran pilot with a Germanic devotion to the book.&#160; And a flawed book.&#160; Remove any one and the chain collapses.&#160; Swissair Flight&#160;111 passes quietly through the darkness unnoticed off Peggy's Cove, landing in faraway Geneva...

Arc Fault breaker dances through first test, no trips!</a> (pdf)
<br>...Arc fault circuit breakers are designed to detect and prevent electrical arcing caused by breaks in wire insulation before that arcing can lead to a fire or other catastrophe. Such faults are prone to occur where microscopic cracks, abrasions or breaks in the wire's insulation result as the wire ages, or is improperly installed or maintained. Thermal circuit breakers currently used in most military and civilian aircraft only detect classic &#34;bolted&#34; short circuits...

EASA Notice of Proposed Amendment 2007-01, 2007 March 13<br>
<a href="http://www.easa.europa.eu/doc/Rulemaking/NPA/NPA%202007-01.pdf">
Amendments...Electrical Wiring Interconnection...</a> (pdf) 148 pages
<br>...Electrical wiring systems perform functions essential to the safety 
<br>of the entire aeroplane.&#160; They distribute power throughout the 
<br>aeroplane, transmit signals for control, and send data.&#160; Over time, 
<br>as more sophisticated computerized systems have been introduced 
<br>into aeroplane controls, their electrical wires, cables, and associated 
<br>components have become increasingly important to safe flight.
<br>Historically, manufacturers have been required to provide 
<br>maintenance-related information for aeroplane systems.&#160; However, 
<br><b><big>there has never been a requirement for maintenance 
<br>information specifically for wiring systems</big></b>...
<br>Safety concerns about wiring systems in aeroplanes were brought 
<br>to the forefront of public and governmental attention by a mid-air 
<br>explosion in 1996 involving a 747&#160;aeroplane.&#160; Ignition of flammable 
<br>vapours in the fuel tank was the probable cause of that fatal accident 
<br>and the most likely source was determined to be a wiring failure 
<br>causing a spark to enter the fuel tank.&#160; All 230&#160;people aboard were 
<br>killed.&#160; Two years later, an MD-11 aeroplane crashed into the Atlantic 
<br>Ocean,  killing all 229&#160;people aboard.&#160; Although an exact cause 
<br>could not be determined, a region of resolidified copper on a wire 
<br>of the inflight-entertainment system cable indicated that wire arcing 
<br>had occurred in the area where the fire most likely originated.
<br>Investigations of those accidents and subsequent examinations of 
<br>other aeroplanes showed that deteriorated wiring, corrosion, 
<br>improper wire installation and repairs, and contamination of wire 
<br>bundles with metal shavings, dust, and fluids, which would provide 
<br>fuel for fire, were common conditions in representative examples 
<br>of the &#34;ageing fleet of transport aeroplanes.&#34; It was concluded that 
<br><b>current maintenance practices do not adequately address 
<br>wiring components, wiring inspection criteria are too general, 
<br>and unacceptable conditions, such as improper repairs and 
<br>installations, are not described in enough detail in maintenance 
<br>instructions.</b>&#160; Wiring failures result in aeroplane delays, unscheduled 
<br>landings, in-flight entertainment system problems, nonfatal accidents, 
<br>and fatal accidents.&#160; <b>Up until this time, aeroplane wiring has 
<br>never been singled out for special attention during maintenance 
<br>inspections.</b>&#160; Although close attention is paid to safe design within 
<br>systems, it was assumed that for the wiring providing power to 
<br>those systems, standard industry practice was appropriate, and 
<br><b>modifications have often been performed without scrutiny for 
<br>the effect their wiring additions may have on other systems in 
<br>the aeroplane.</b>&#160; Damaged wire and insulation can cause electrical 
<br>arcing, providing the spark that can cause fire. Dust, dirt, lint, 
<br>contamination, and vapours provide fuel for fire.&#160; Recent rules have 
<br>established requirements for wiring connected to fuel tank systems. 
<br>This proposal goes further; to address all the wiring contained in 
<br>an aeroplane, as systems on their own, and provides scrutiny of 
<br>the conditions that affect their safe functioning.&#160; It aligns with 
<br>the requirements for fuel tank wiring.&#160; This Notice of Proposed 
<br>Amendment (NPA) introduces requirements and associated 
<br>guidance material as they relate to Electrical Wiring Interconnection 
<br>System (EWIS).&#160; It is harmonised with the FAA.&#160; Amendments to 
<br>CS-25 are envisaged to enhance the design requirements related to 
<br>wiring as well as improved provisions to assure the continuing 
<br>airworthiness of EWIS.&#160; However to address the safety issue at 
<br>hand <b>it is not sufficient to address future designs only</b>, which 
<br>is the result of an amendment to CS-25.&#160; To achieve the full safety 
<br>benefit the Regulatory Impact Assessment...concludes that 
<br><b>the Enhanced Zonal Analysis Procedure should also be 
<br>performed on existing designs</b> to improve the instructions 
<br>for continuing airworthiness.&#160; Therefore at the end of this NPA 
<br>a draft measure...requiring type certificate holders to produce 
<br>instructions for continuing airworthiness...

Federal Aviation Administration Report to 
<br>U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary E. Peters 
<br>on American Airlines MD-80 Groundings</a> Executive Summary
<br>...After the Swissair 111 accident in September 1998 involving 
<br>an MD-11, both the FAA and industry learned a great deal about 
<br>wiring and the related safety issues.&#160; In January 1999, the 
<br>National Transportation Safety Board issued a recommendation 
<br>addressing the inspection and examination of wiring on MD-11 
<br>airplanes.&#160; The examinations were for loose wire connections, 
<br>inconsistent wire routings, broken bonding wires, small wire 
<br>bend radii, and chafed and cracked wire insulation.  
<br>The inspections revealed chafed and cut wires; damaged, 
<br>cracked, or chafed wires; and inconsistencies in the routing 
<br>of wires and wire bundles....

Die by Wire: everything you didn't want to know about airliner wiring</a>
<br>...This catastrophic crash may become the turning point on an issue of 
<br>air safety that remains largely hidden. The Canadians now have it in their 
<br>grasp to prove something that has been suspected for twenty years. 
<br>A new and frightening truth is emerging from beneath the calm waters 
<br>of Peggy's Cove... Every large modern passenger jet contains some 
<br>150 miles [240 km] of wiring.&#160; These hidden blood vessels carry 
<br>power for the thousands of functions today's modern jets must perform. 
<br>For years the manufacturers have treated wire as wire.&#160; Fit and forget. 
<br>But that's all changing.&#160; Wiring is not as innocent as it first looked. 
<br>90% of the planes flying today come under the wing of the Boeing 
<br>Aircraft Company.&#160; Until eight years ago, most of its aircraft contained 
<br>a particular aircraft wire insulated with a plastic material known colloquially 
<br>as &#34;Kapton&#34;. This is a piece of Kapton insulated wire. It's still made today 
<br>and flies in over a third of the world's commercial planes.&#160; Kapton is best 
<br>when young.&#160; It's feather weight, the thickness of only about three human 
<br>hairs, flame resistant, tough.&#160; That's the good news.&#160; And this is the bad. 
<br>The Kapton insulation can explode like a firework if it's chafed or rubs 
<br>against metal...&#160; Worse still, salt water or solvent can penetrate the 
<br>insulation and cause the same problem...&#160; Most wires, when they 
<br>short-circuit, simply spark and blow a fuse.&#160; But with Kapton insulation, 
<br>the spark explodes and arcs setting fire to the plastic insulation...

Aging aircraft wiring</a> by Michael Westergren
<br>Wiring is the backbone of all aircraft systems.&#160; Some compare it to
<br>the arteries and veins inside our bodies.&#160; However it is looked at,
<br>failures in the wire system can range from minor irritants to major
<br>catastrophes.&#160; Commercial aviation is particularly concerned with
<br>this issue.&#160; Wiring has emerged as a critical safety-of-flight system
<br>because of the increasing complexity, high density, and critical
<br>interface between electrical and electronic subsystems.&#160; Wiring
<br>failure is implicated in the...downing of SwissAir flight 111 in
<br>the North Atlantic...

Multitude of causes lined up for crash of Flight 111</a>
<br>...&#34;The crash of Swissair Flight 111 is likely to be one of those
<br>seminal events that changes design practices and operational <br>procedures throughout the airline industry,&#34; said David Evans,
<br>editor of the industry newsletter <i>Air Safety Week</i>.&#160; &#34;I think the
<br>tragedy did not so much raise new issues of air safety as to <br>bring old problems into sharp focus.&#160; They have been lurking,

Cruel Lessons of Aircraft Fires Mandate More, Not Marginal Capability</a>
<br>...As an example of the information gap, Tom Phillips, chairman of the 
<br>accident survival committee of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), 
<br>offered this illustration: High over the Atlantic, a warning light illuminates on 
<br>the cockpit center console, indicating a possible fire in the aft belly hold. 
<br>In a chill of anxiety, the pilot activates the fire suppression system, which 
<br>squirts a bottle-full of Halon into the hold.&#160; The light remains on.&#160; He has 
<br>no idea if it is a false warning (the false alarm rate is about 160:1), or if 
<br>a fire is raging down below that could soon burn through the belly 
<br>compartment and spread through the aircraft.&#160; He can divert to one of two 
<br>airfields.&#160; One is 300 miles [500 km] distant &#8211; a former military base with 
<br>no significant airport rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) capability.&#160; The other 
<br>airport is 600 miles [1000 km] distant with full ARFF capability.&#160; &#34;Which 
<br>one do you divert to?&#34; Phillips asked.&#160; &#34;All we have is that little light&#34;...

<br>...The shattered pieces were taken to an aircraft hangar outside Halifax
<br>where TSB officials painstakingly pieced them together.&#160; What they found 
<br>was a chain of events that were as unusual in their circumstance as they were
<br>tragic in their outcome.&#160; &#34;A fire during a flight is very rare,&#34; Vance explained 
<br>in a recent interview from his office in Ottawa.&#160; So are crashes into the ocean. 
<br>In the case of Swissair Flight 111, the plane was intact until it hit the ocean 
<br>and that allowed investigators to get a rare look at a fire's progress until the 
<br>instant it was extinguished.&#160; &#34;We basically had a stoppage of time,&#34; said 
<br>Vance.&#160; &#34;I don't think that has ever happened (before) and may never happen <br>again.&#160; It gave us the opportunity to place the aircraft pieces back where 
<br>they belong, trace the history of the fire, and see what it was actually doing&#34;...

<br><span class="comment61">[boldface emphasis added]</span>
<br>
<br>Safety concerns about wiring systems in aeroplanes were brought to the
<br>forefront of public and governmental attention by a mid-air explosion
<br>in 1996... Two years later, an MD-11 aeroplane crashed into the Atlantic
<br>Ocean,  killing all 229&#160;people aboard.&#160; Although an exact cause could not
<br>be determined, a region of resolidified copper on a wire of the inflight
<br>entertainment system cable indicated that wire arcing had occurred in
<br>the area where the fire most likely originated.&#160; Investigations of those
<br>accidents and subsequent examinations of other aeroplanes showed that
<br>deteriorated wiring, corrosion, improper wire installation and repairs,
<br>and contamination of wire bundles with metal shavings, dust, and fluids,
<br>which would provide fuel for fire, were common conditions in
<br>representative examples of the &#34;ageing fleet of transport aeroplanes...&#34;
<br>
<br>It was concluded that <b>current maintenance practices do not
<br>adequately address wiring components, wiring inspection criteria
<br>are too general, and unacceptable conditions, such as improper
<br>repairs and installations, are not described in enough detail in
<br>maintenance instructions.</b>&#160; Wiring failures result in aeroplane delays,
<br>unscheduled landings, in-flight entertainment system problems,
<br>nonfatal accidents, and fatal accidents...
<br><span class="comment61">[boldface emphasis added]</span>
<br>
<br><b>Up until this time, aeroplane wiring has never been singled out
<br>for special attention during maintenance inspections</b>...
<br><span class="comment61">[boldface emphasis added]</span>
<br>
<br>Although close attention is paid to safe design within systems, it was
<br>assumed that for the wiring providing power to those systems,
<br>standard industry practice was appropriate, and <b>modifications have
<br>often been performed without scrutiny for the effect their wiring
<br>additions may have on other systems in the aeroplane.</b>...

Swissair 111 Human Factors: Checklists and Cockpit Communication</a>
<br>...problems with the MD-11 checklist were uncovered during the TSB's 
<br>investigation of the Swissair&#160;111 accident.&#160; Past research indicates that 
<br>Flight Officers may have difficulty communicating with captains and 
<br>that this difficulty increases during times of high stress... 
<br>
<br>One of the criticisms of the pilots and Swissair culture was an overreliance 
<br>on checklists.&#160; Captain John Nance, pilot, author, attorney, and ABC TV 
<br>Network safety analyst, believed that Swissair's culture emphasized the 
<br>checklist causing the pilots to spend precious time going through a 
<br>logic tree rather than preparing to land... 
<br>
<br>More troublesome for the TSB was the location of landing preparations 
<br>on the checklists.&#160; Neither the Swissair nor the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas" title="Go to article &#34;McDonnell Douglas&#34; in Wikipedia">McDonnell-Douglas</a>
<br>Smoke of Unknown Origin Checklist stated that preparations for an 
<br>emergency landing should be considered immediately.&#160; In fact, landing 
<br>was the last item on the checklist.&#160; With Swissair&#160;111, the TSB found 
<br>that even if landing had been first on the list, the aircraft would not have 
<br>had enough time to land safely at Halifax.&#160; Also, as noted above, the pilots 
<br>did begin preparations for landing before initiating any checklists.&#160; While 
<br>inconsequential for Swissair&#160;111, however, placement on the checklist 
<br>could endanger future flights.&#160; The Smoke of Unknown Origin Checklist
<br>could take more than 30 minutes to complete...the TBS warned that for
<br>ongoing in-flight fires 30&#160;minutes may be too long... 
<br>
<br>The MD-11 checklists and the smoke switch used in the procedure were 
<br>developed to replace the multiple steps a flight engineer carried out for many 
<br>years on the DC-10.&#160; While it is true that the procedures and the development 
<br>of a single switch in some respects simplified smoke troubleshooting, it also 
<br>placed the workload previously handled by three crew members onto the 
<br>shoulders of only two crew members... 
<br><br>
Excessive obedience may cause as many as 25% of all airplane accidents... 
<br><br>
One of the most controversial moments in the flight came when the aircraft 
<br>changed course away from Halifax and out to sea to dump fuel.&#160; The TSB 
<br>emphasized in the TSB Final that the pilots did not know, and could not have 
<br>known, how far the problem had already developed...&#160; Multiple failures are
<br>extremely improbable considering the highly automated and redundant 
<br>systems found in modern passenger aircraft.&#160; They do happen, however, 
<br>as illustrated by Swissair 111.&#160; While the checklists did not play a role in the
<br>outcome of Swissair 111, conflicts did arise between two of the checklists...

The Tragic Legacy of Swissair Flight 111</a>
<br>...Someone had to speak out for all the senseless deaths and
<br>the many families destroyed by the FAA's lack of attention to:
<br>&#8226;&#160; The hazards associated with specific aircraft wiring
<br>insulation types, snaked throughout the airliner and long known 
<br>for their propensity to arc when chafed or cracked.
<br>&#8226;&#160; The dangers of the metallized Mylar thermal 
<br>acoustic insulation blankets, present throughout the airframe 
<br>and highly flammable when ignited by an arcing wire.
<br>The FAA was alerted to this deadly hazard by the Civil Aviation

FAA failings in Swissair crash follow a too-familiar pattern</a>
<br>...In all three tragedies, the FAA botched its paramount mission:
<br>to make sure that those inspecting, maintaining and modifying
<br>commercial airliners do their jobs properly... The Swissair crash
<br>underscores the risks of further delay.&#160; USA Today reported
<br>last week that the airline had fitted some of its planes with a
<br>sophisticated entertainment system that let passengers watch
<br>movies, shop and gamble.&#160; The FAA failed to oversee the
<br>installation, and problems later surfaced with both the system
<br>and Santa Barbara Aerospace, the company that signed off on
<br>the safety of the planes.&#160; Before the crash, the FAA repeatedly
<br>cited the firm for poor performance and even briefly suspended
<br>it while the entertainment system was being installed on Swissair
<br>planes.&#160; Those concerns should have prompted the FAA to take
<br>a closer look at the project.&#160; But it didn't.&#160; Swissair Flight 111
<br>carried a system suspected of sparking a deadly electrical fire,
<br>though an official cause has not yet been released.&#160; Only after
<br>the crash did the FAA acknowledge risks with the system
<br>and Santa Barbara Aerospace's procedures...

Swissair Crash Tests Relations With Insurers</a>
<br>...The relationship between Swissair, which hadn't had a crash in 
<br>19 years, and the victims' families got off to as good a start as 
<br>could be expected after the Sept. 2, 1998, tragedy.&#160; Within hours, 
<br>the airline &#8211; in conjunction with Delta Airlines, its 
<br>code-sharing partner on the flight &#8211; had employees at 
<br>New York's Kennedy Airport provide limited information and 
<br>grief counseling.&#160; Following the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800, 
<br>airlines have been required by law to take this step in crashes 
<br>involving every flight that takes off from or lands in the U.S. 
<br>Walter Vollenweider, the Swissair executive then in charge of 
<br>the Americas, arrived at Kennedy Airport within an hour to 
<br>personally comfort family members.&#160; In addition, Swissair and 
<br>Delta flew multiple family members to Halifax, near where 
<br>the crash occurred, at their expense...

<br>The entertainment system was made by a U.S. company, Interactive
