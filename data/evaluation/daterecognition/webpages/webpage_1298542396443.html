<strong>HISTORY:</strong> Home of the Ute and Paiute Indians, Utah was first explored by
Spanish monks in 1776. Most influential in the state's development were Mormon refugees
from religious persecution in the East, who settled Salt Lake City in 1847. While others
had shunned Utah's dry desert land, the Mormons made the land bloom through hard work.
Admission of Utah to the U.S. was not achieved until after the Mormon Church ended its
support of polygamy, the practice of a man having more than one wife. National parks like
Zion, Arches, and Bryce draw many tourists each year and top filmmakers flock to the
Sundance Institute in the mountains outside of Salt Lake City, where independent films are
nurtured. </p>

<strong>SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH </strong><br>
<br>
Fleeing from religious persecution in Illinois, a group of Mormons led by Brigham Young
came to the Salt Lake Valley in the Summer of 1847. A desolate expanse of land, Young told
his group that this was where they would build their new settlement and worship their
Mormon religion. Today, that spot is the thriving Salt Lake City, capital of Utah, and
headquarters of the Mormon Church (seen here). Utah is 70 percent Mormon and Mormon
beliefs influence its politics. <br>
<br>
Officially called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormon religion was
born in Palmyra, New York in 1823. Here, an 18-year-old man named Joseph Smith told of his
vision of an angel named Moroni who told him of a book made of gold leaves, revealing the
true nature of the Christian Church and explaining the lost tribes of Israel. Though
ridiculed by many, Smith did attract followers, called Mormons. <br>
<br>
Smith and other Mormons were persecuted in New York and they moved to Ohio, and then to
Missouri, where they were attacked and 17 Mormons killed. They then moved to Illinois,
where they were promised peace to practice their new religion. <br>
<br>
It was in Illinois that Smith said God told him that Mormons should practice polygamy, the
taking by a man of more than one wife. This made non-Mormons hostile toward the Mormons. <br>
<br>
In 1844, Smith declared himself a presidential candidate and Brigham Young was chosen to
take over leadership of the Mormon Church. That same year, a mob killed Smith and his
brother in Illinois. Two years later, in 1846, Young and his Mormons headed west facing
much hardship along what came to be called the Mormon Trail; they landed in the Salt Lake
area. <br>
<br>
Finally, the Mormons found a place to practice their religion in peace. As for polygamy,
some Mormons are known to practice it very quietly, even though it became officially
illegal when Utah became a state -- American law outlaws the practice of a man having more
than one wife. </p>
