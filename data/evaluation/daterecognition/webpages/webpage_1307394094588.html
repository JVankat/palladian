        </center>
      </h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economists and other 
        social scientists have demonstrated that the R&amp;D activities of private 
        firms generate widespread benefits enjoyed by consumers and society at 
        large. As a result, the overall economic value to society often exceeds 
        the economic benefits enjoyed by innovating firms as a result of their 
        research efforts. This excess of the <em>social rate of return</em> over 
        the <em>private rate of return</em> enjoyed by innovating firms is described 
        by economists as a positive externality or spillover. These spillovers 
        imply that private firms will invest less than is socially desirable in 
        research, with the result that some desirable research projects will not 
        be undertaken, and others will be undertaken more slowly, later, or on 
        a smaller scale than would be socially desirable. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These spillovers flow 
        through a number of distinct channels. First, spillovers occur because 
        the workings of the market or markets for an innovative product or process 
        create benefits for consumers and non-innovating firms ("market spillovers"). 
        Second, spillovers occur because <em>knowledge </em>created by one firm 
        is typically not contained within that firm, and thereby creates value 
        for other firms and other firms' customers ("knowledge spillovers"). Finally, 
        because the profitability of a set of interrelated and interdependent 
        technologies may depend on achieving a critical mass of success, each 
        firm pursuing one or more of these related technologies creates economic 
        benefits for other firms and their customers ("network spillovers"). </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ATP would like 
        to invest in projects that have a high social rate of return, but that 
        would be underfunded, delayed or otherwise inadequately pursued in the 
        absence of ATP support. This objective can be furthered by pursuing projects 
        for which the gap between the social and private rates of return ("the 
        spillover gap") is large. Existing ATP analyses--including examination 
        of broad-based economic benefits, consideration of whether a technology 
        is "enabling," and consideration of the need for ATP funding-- implicitly

      <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="I."></a> I. INTRODUCTION 
        AND OVERVIEW</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economists use the 
        term "spillover" to capture the idea that some of the economic benefits 
        of Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities accrue to economic agents 
        other than the party that undertakes the research. Purchasers of better 
        or cheaper products, competing firms that imitate a successful innovation, 
        and firms whose own research benefits from observation of the successes 
        and failures of others' research efforts all garner such spillover benefits. 
        As these examples suggest, these spillovers are created by a combination 
        of the new knowledge resulting from an R&amp;D effort, and the commercialization 
        of the new technology in terms of a product or process that is successfully 
        implemented in the marketplace. Thus a complete understanding of the R&amp;D 
        spillover phenomena requires an unusual combination of scientific/technical 
        and business/economic analysis. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Standard economic 
        analysis postulates that economic agents try to maximize their self interest. 
        In the context of R&amp;D, this implies that firms make decisions about 
        the level and focus of their R&amp;D efforts based on maximization of 
        their long-run profit. Firms deciding whether or not to pursue a particular 
        line of research, or deciding on the margin what level of resources to 
        devote to a research project, try to balance, in some rough way, the cost 
        of the R&amp;D against the future profits that the effort might yield, 
        taking into account the tremendous uncertainty about both the overall 
        costs and benefits. Because of research spillovers, there are benefits 
        that are created for the economy and for society when a firm undertakes 
        a research project (or increases its level of commitment to an ongoing 
        project) that are ignored in this cost/benefit calculation.<a name="Back to 1"></a> 
        <a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The social rate of return to R&amp;D 
        will generally exceed the private rate of return.<a name="Back to 2"></a> 
        <a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Since firms make their decisions based 
        only on the private rate of return, they will fail to undertake some projects 
        that are socially desirable, and they will generally pursue the projects 
        that they do undertake at a level of resource commitment that is lower 
        than is desirable from the point of view of society as a whole. In economists' 
        jargon, there is a "market failure" with respect to R&amp;D that results 
        in market forces allocating fewer of society's overall resources to R&amp;D 
        than is desirable. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">R&amp;D spillovers 
        are thus an example of a positive externality. Other examples of activities 
        that generate positive externalities (and hence are underprovided by a 
        laissez-faire market system) include prompt garbage removal, inoculations 
        and employee training. The concept of positive externalities is very closely 
        related to the concept of "public goods." In the limit, the benefits of 
        an activity may be so diffuse that no individual or firm would undertake 
        the activity on their own, such as national defense. R&amp;D (and the 
        other examples in this paragraph) fall in an intermediate range in which 
        the activity generates sufficient benefit to the party undertaking it 
        that market forces generate some, but not enough, of the activity. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The market failure 
        created by R&amp;D spillovers is one of the primary justifications for 
        government policies designed to encourage R&amp;D. This report will describe 
        what is known by economists about the phenomenon of R&amp;D spillovers, 
        and assess the relevance of this knowledge for the ATP. A thorough understanding 
        of the spillover process is important to the ATP for at least three reasons. 
        First, since a large fraction of aggregate R&amp;D expenditures are funded 
        by other government programs, and the U.S. tax code creates significant 
        incentives to privately-funded R&amp;D, the policy justification for the 
        ATP rests on a demonstration that the program incrementally increases 
        social returns, relative to what would occur in its absence. In other 
        words, it is insufficient simply to cite the existence of spillovers. 
        The ATP must be able to show that the government policy portfolio including 
        the ATP is more effective at correcting the R&amp;D market failure than 
        the portfolio without the ATP would be. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Second, better understanding 
        of the spillover process will facilitate selection of projects for funding 
        by the ATP so as to maximize the social rate of return to the ATP expenditures. 
        While there is inherently much uncertainty regarding the spillover potential 
        of particular projects (just as there is much uncertainty about their 
        technical potential), it is possible to identify generic features that 
        will tend, on average, to be associated with a greater likelihood of spillovers. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Finally, to the extent 
        that the policy justification for the ATP lies in creating spillovers, 
        then any attempt to evaluate the ATP's success must try to measure those 
        spillovers. Hence a better understanding of the process will foster the 
        development of data collection and research efforts that are appropriate 
        to quantification of the spillovers generated by the ATP investments. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The spillover phenomenon 
        is not the only factor that may cause socially desirable research efforts 
        to be underfunded. In particular, capital market imperfections have the 
        effect that risk and financial factors may also impede socially desirable 
        research and development efforts. This report does not provide an explicit 
        analysis of these other factors, but does consider their likely interaction 
        with the spillover process, and the consequences of this interaction for 
        the ATP. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The next section 
        of this report will discuss the analytical underpinnings of the spillover 
        concept in more detail, and relate this analytical framework to analyses 
        already undertaken by the ATP. Section III will discuss the findings of 
        economic research regarding the magnitude of spillovers, and the circumstances 
        that make them more or less likely. Section IV then suggests ways in which 
        the current ATP analysis of spillovers could be expanded, and considers 
        the difficult issues raised by the interaction of spillovers, risk, and 
        private decisions regarding R&amp;D expenditures. Section V discusses 
        the issue of designing research and data collection to measure spillover 
        impacts and improve the ability of the ATP to assess the likely spillover 
        potential of project proposals. Section VI provides concluding comments.

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="II.A"></a>A. Sources 
        of Spillovers </font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spillovers have been 
        of interest to economists since at least the nineteenth century. At that 
        time, organized scientific research was uncommon in industrial firms. 
        Technological knowledge was built more by informal "tinkering" and learning 
        by doing. Alfred Marshall, one of the founders of modern microeconomics, 
        made such informal learning a centerpiece of his analysis of the evolution 
        of the modern, large industrial firm. He wrote that: </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of those economies 
        in the use of specialized skill and machinery which are commonly regarded 
        as within the reach of very large establishments, do not depend on the 
        size of individual factories. Some depend on the aggregate volume of production 
        of the kind in the neighborhood; while others again, especially those 
        connected with the growth of knowledge and the progress of the industrial 
        arts, depend chiefly on the aggregate volume of production in the whole 
        civilized world. (Marshall, 1920) </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> He argued that R&amp;D 
        spillovers were on the rise, remarking, "the secrecy of business is on 
        the whole diminishing, and the most important improvements in method seldom 
        remain secret for long after they have passed from the experimental stage." 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analytically, it is 
        useful to distinguish several different mechanisms by which R&amp;D generates 
        spillovers. For convenience, I refer to these as "knowledge spillovers," 
        "market spillovers," and "network spillovers." In order to think through 
        the implications of spillovers for the ATP, it is useful to consider each 
        of these separately, and then to note that they also interact in a way 
        that tends to increase their combined effect. </font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="II.A.1"></a>1. <strong> 
        Knowledge spillovers </strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quote from Marshall 
        refers to the phenomenon of knowledge spillovers. Knowledge created by 
        one agent can be used by another without compensation, or with compensation 
        less than the value of the knowledge. Knowledge spillovers are particularly 
        likely to result from basic research, but they are also produced by applied 
        research and technology development. This can occur in obvious ways, such 
        as "reverse engineering" of products, and also in less obvious ways, such 
        as when one firm's abandonment of a particular research line signals to 
        others that the line is unproductive and hence saves them the expense 
        of learning this themselves. The spillover beneficiary may use the new 
        knowledge to copy or imitate the commercial products or processes of the 
        innovator, or may use the knowledge as an input to a research process 
        leading to other new technologies. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In some circumstances 
        the creation of knowledge spillovers is intentional on the part of the 
        innovator; the publication of scientific papers is, at least in part, 
        intended to spread new knowledge so that it can be used by the widest 
        possible audience. In the case of patented inventions, society requires 
        disclosure of new knowledge as a quid pro quo for the granting of monopoly 
        rights in the commercial use of an invention. The effect of this disclosure 
        is, in principle, to make the new knowledge available to others for the 
        purpose of facilitating new and different applications, while at the same 
        time protecting the inventor against copying. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knowledge spillovers 
        also occur when researchers leave a firm and take a job at another firm 
        (or start their own). While trade secret law gives firms some ability 
        to protect knowledge they have created, it is extremely difficult to effectively 
        protect tacit knowledge about successful and unsuccessful approaches, 
        mechanisms etc. Further, important innovative successes are likely to 
        increase the incentives for researchers to capitalize on their tacit knowledge 
        by moving to another firm or starting their own. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More generally, commercial 
        development and use of new knowledge will tend to cause it to spread, 
        despite any desire of the inventor to prevent such spread. Economic exploitation 
        of new knowledge requires the sale of new commercial products embodying 
        that knowledge or the incorporation of that knowledge into new commercial 
        production processes. Such commercialization tends, in general to reveal 
        at least some aspects of the new knowledge to other economic agents. Hence 
        the very process of economically exploiting the knowledge that research 
        creates tends to pass that knowledge to others. Because the spread of 
        knowledge is greatly affected by the commercial use of new technology, 
        even the analysis of "knowledge" spillovers must be informed by an understanding 
        of the market mechanisms that govern the spread of new technology. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="II.A.2"></a> 2. <strong> 
        Market spillovers</strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Market spillovers 
        result when the operation of the market for a new product or process causes 
        some of the benefits thereby created to flow to market participants other 
        than the innovating firm. It is this "leakage" of benefits through the 
        operation of market forces, rather than the flow of knowledge itself, 
        that distinguishes market spillovers from knowledge spillovers. Any time 
        a firm creates a new product, or reduces the cost of producing an existing 
        product, the natural operation of market forces will tend to cause some 
        of the benefits thereby created to be passed on to buyers. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consider first the 
        case of new or improved products. It is likely that a firm that sells 
        a better mousetrap will charge a price that is higher than that being 
        charged for ordinary mousetraps. But innovative products, even those that 
        are patented or otherwise protected from direct competition, will generally 
        be sold at prices that do not <em><strong>fully</strong> </em>capture 
        all of the superiority of the new product relative to what was available 
        before. As a result, consumers will be made better off by the introduction 
        of the new product. This increase in consumer welfare is a social benefit 
        from a new product that is not captured by the innovator. <a name="Back to 3"></a><a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 
        Similarly, if a company does R&amp;D to lower its production cost, it 
        will typically lower its selling price as a result. Again, the innovator's 
        customers are better off, and a benefit is created that is not captured 
        by the innovator. Of course, innovation often results in both higher quality/performance 
        and lower prices; thereby benefiting customers even more. </font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="II.A.3"></a>3. <strong> 
        Network spillovers </strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Network spillovers 
        result when the commercial or economic value of a new technology is strongly 
        dependent on the development of a set of related technologies. An example 
        of network spillovers exists among all of the different developers of 
        application software for use with a new operating system platform. If 
        one firm develops a particular application, people will buy it only if 
        many other firms develop other sufficient applications so that the platform 
        itself is attractive and widely used <a name="Back to 4"></a><a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 
        </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If the commercial 
        payoff to <strong><em>each</em></strong> of a set of related research 
        projects is dependent on <em>all</em> or a significant fraction of the 
        projects being completed successfully, then private firms might hesitate 
        to undertake any one of the projects, for fear that the others will not 
        be undertaken. Conversely, if any one firm decides to undertake such a 
        project, it creates a positive externality for all the other firms, by 
        increasing the probability that the "critical mass" will be achieved. 
        Note that this positive externality or spillover exists even if there 
        is no knowledge spillover among the firms (although it is likely that 
        knowledge spillovers would also be occurring). </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The existence of network 
        externalities creates a "coordination problem" that is another possible 
        market failure associated with research. Where network externalities are 
        important, it is possible that firms' inability to coordinate their efforts 
        will lead to a misdirection of research effort, away from the activities 
        associated with network externalities, even if firms are in the aggregate 
        undertaking a socially efficient <em><strong>level</strong></em> of research 
        effort. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important to 
        emphasize that the coordination problem only arises if there are reasons 
        why a single firm cannot develop all of the necessary related components 
        (or contract with others for their development) and thereby internalize 
        the network externality. Thus while you cannot run a computer without 
        an operating system, the need for the operating system software does not 
        create an important coordination problem, as the hardware manufacturer 
        can either write the operating system itself or contract for its creation. 
        What distinguishes the operating system (which does not create a significant 
        network externality) from the need for applications programs (which might) 
        is the likelihood that <em><strong>many</strong></em> different applications 
        will ultimately be necessary, and that it is unlikely that one firm would 
        have all the capabilities to create all of these different applications, 
        or even to know what the set of necessary applications will ultimately 
        look like. To put it differently, synergistic market interactions among 
        a small number of technologies is unlikely to create a coordination problem, 
        but when the number of technologies that must be developed is large and 
        the necessary capabilities are diverse, the coordination problem may become 
        severe. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are a number 
        of different mechanisms by which the coordination problem created by network 
        externalities can be handled. Research joint ventures, in which a number 
        of companies combine forces, can be used to pursue the interrelated approaches 
        whose commercial success is interdependent. By fostering the creation 
        of such joint ventures, the ATP assists this process. In addition, the 
        formation of focused programs targeted at a set of interrelated technologies 
        can be used to try to ensure that a critical mass will be reached. Focused 
        programs are discussed in section IV.C. </font>

      out of firm 1's profit and into the benefits captured by firm 1's customers. 
      </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economists would say 
        there is an "appropriability" problem, because firm 1 is not able to appropriate 
        to itself all of the benefits created by its investment in research. Of 
        course, firms will attempt to solve the appropriability problem, using 
        various mechanisms to try to capture the fruits of research. Economists 
        studying the innovation process have identified a number of such appropriability 
        mechanisms, and have identified market conditions that tend to make them 
        more or less successful. This research is discussed in Section III.B. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is obvious from 
        Figure 1 that the market spillovers will not be realized unless the innovation 
        is commercialized successfully. Market spillovers accrue to the customers 
        that use the innovative product; they will not come to pass if a technically 
        successful effort does not lead to successful commercialization. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An interesting case 
        -- and one that illustrates the dividing line between knowledge spillovers 
        and market spillovers -- occurs when a firm invests its resources in developing 
        an improved input to its own production process, such as a new material 
        or a new machine tool. Often, the firm will then work with its supplier 
        firms to produce this new input. The innovator will get the benefit of 
        the innovation in its own production (and its <em><strong>customers</strong></em> 
        will enjoy market spillovers), but the supplier may, in turn, sell the 
        improved input to other firms, creating profits for itself and benefits 
        to those purchasing firms (and their customers). </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One could think of 
        this as a knowledge spillover, in the sense that the knowledge created 
        by the innovator has leaked to its supplier. But the transfer of knowledge 
        to the supplier is not an accident, it is a necessary step in implementing 
        the innovation. In theory, one could imagine the innovator writing a contract 
        with the supplier that ensures that all of the benefits of future sales 
        are captured by the innovating customer. In practice, such a contract 
        is impossible to write; the inability to write such a contract is a market 
        imperfection that creates the market spillover. In other words, knowledge 
        spillovers can be thought of as benefit leakages that occur in the absence 
        of a market interaction between the innovator and the spillover beneficiary, 
        whereas market spillovers result from a market interaction between them. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note that market spillovers 
        occur whether the purchaser of the new product is a household or another 
        firm. In the case of improved intermediate products, then the market spillover 
        benefits will be passed to the purchasing firms, which will in turn tend 
        to pass at least some of this benefit to their customers. For example, 
        if a supplier to the auto industry develops a better material, that material 
        will be sold to auto companies at a price that does not fully reflect 
        its improved properties. In turn, the auto companies will sell the better 
        autos to consumers at a price that is either lower than before (if the 
        new material significantly reduced production costs) or else results in 
        a price/quality combination that is superior from the consumers' point 
        of view. Such a chain of spillovers can be quite long; a new catalyst 
        could permit economic production of a new polymer that results in a better 
        fiber that is used in better fabric that is eventually incorporated in 
        a better garment. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An important case 
        of market spillovers associated with intermediate goods is where the innovation 
        is an input to the research process, such as a new material or instrument. 
        The purchaser is another researcher, who will typically use the new device 
        in ways that create further spillovers. This case of "infratechnologies" 
        is discussed further below. </font>

        Pure knowledge spillover </strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 2 illustrates 
        the effect of adding a "pure" knowledge spillover. By "pure," I mean a 
        knowledge spillover that flows to firms that do not compete in firm 1's 
        markets. Their increase in knowledge as a result of firm 1's research 
        allows them to improve their products or lower their costs, increasing 
        their profits and customer benefits in their markets.<a name="Back to 7"></a><a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> 
        Both these profits and the consumer benefits are part of the social return, 
        but are not captured by firm 1, and so the spillover gap is increased.</font>

        </font> 
      </center>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note that even in 
        the case of knowledge spillovers, the social return is created by the 
        <em><strong>commercial use</strong></em> of a new process or product, 
        and the profits and consumer benefits thereby created. The difference 
        between market spillovers and knowledge spillovers is that in the former 
        case the commercial benefits are created in the market for the new product 
        or process that is the direct "output" of the research effort, while in 
        the case of knowledge spillovers the commercial benefits are created indirectly 
        through the creation of new or improved products or processes in other 
        markets. Though as a society we value "knowledge for knowledge's sake," 
        I am not including such non-economic value within the concept of knowledge 
        spillovers used here. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 2 indicates 
        that the knowledge spillovers flow to some extent from firm 1's creation 
        of new knowledge, and to some extent from firm 1's commercialization efforts. 
        This reflects the idea that other firms may learn to some extent from 
        papers, patents, departing employees, and other disembodied outputs of 
        firm 1's research, but they are likely to learn more when firm 1's research 
        results are actually embodied in new commercial products and processes. 
        The relative importance and the speed of these two pathways will vary, 
        depending on the nature of the research. In general, knowledge spillovers 
        from more basic research would be expected to flow mostly from the research 
        results themselves, and to take a fairly long time to have the commercial 
        impact indicated in the lower part of Figure 2.<a name="Back to 8"></a><a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> 
        On the other hand, knowledge spillovers from applied research and development 
        are more likely to flow from the products or processes embodying the research 
        results, and thereby have a quicker economic impact. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, for the kinds 
        of applied research and development projects that are the focus of the 
        ATP, the realization of spillover benefits, and social returns more broadly, 
        is strongly dependent on successful commercialization of the new technology. 
        This is true both for market spillovers (which depend entirely on commercialization) 
        and knowledge spillovers (which are likely to be largely dependent on 
        and speeded by commercialization). New technology that remains "on the 
        shelf" does not benefit customers, and hence does not create market spillovers, 
        and the knowledge spillover impact is likely to be limited. Basic research 
        of the sort that is the mission of other federal agencies besides the 
        ATP is likely to create knowledge spillovers that are more diffuse and 
        slower to materialize. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="II.B.3"></a> 3. <strong> 
        The interaction of market and knowledge spillovers</strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It will often be the 
        case that at least some of the firms that benefit from the knowledge spillover 
        will be competitors or potential competitors of firm 1. The extreme case 
        of this is pure imitation, where other firms copy the innovations of firm 
        1; more generally, firms making similar or related products may be able 
        to improve their products or lower their costs on the basis of things 
        they are able to learn as a result of firm 1's research. As shown in Figure 
        3, this complicates the picture in two ways. First, the introduction of 
        these cheaper or better products into firm 1's markets creates some additional 
        customer benefits, and some profits for these other firms, both of which 
        constitute social returns not captured by firm 1. These increase the spillover 
        gap. </font> 
      <p> 
      <center>
        <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 3</font></h2>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="gcr708-3.gif" width=641 height=495 alt="Figure 3"> 
        </font> 
      </center>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time that 
        this increased competition increases social returns, it will likely <em><strong>reduce</strong></em> 
        firm 1's profit from its own innovation. That is, the combination of knowledge 
        spillover with competitive interaction increases the spillover gap both 
        by <em>raising</em> the social return and <em>lowering</em> the private 
        return. Thus "pure" knowledge spillovers increase the social rate of return 
        to R&amp;D, but they do so in a way that at least does not reduce the 
        private return. When knowledge spillovers are combined with competition, 
        however, the effect is likely to be an actual reduction of the private 
        rate of return. Put differently, the interaction of knowledge spillovers 
        and market spillovers aggravates the firm's appropriability problem: not 
        only does the firm create benefits that it cannot capture, but its own 
        profits from marketing its innovation are competed away. Understanding 
        this interaction has important implications for identifying which research 
        projects are likely to have large spillovers. In Section III.B, I discuss 
        the factors that economists have identified that affect firms' ability 
        to deal with this appropriability problem. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, Figure 3 
        can also be used to illustrate the possibility that research effort of 
        any given firm can create a <em><strong>negative</strong></em> externality 
        for other firms. Suppose that the improved products of "other" firms in 
        Figure 3 came from their own research, rather than from a spillover of 
        knowledge from firm 1. In this case, there would still be a diminution 
        of firm 1's profits as a result of this new competition. This <em><strong>reduction</strong></em> 
        in profits of other firms is a negative spillover, just as the increase 
        of profits of other firms in Figure 2 is a positive spillover. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To make this concrete, 
        consider the market for anti-ulcer drugs. In the 1970s, the drug Tagamet 
        was introduced, which, for the first time, reduced the stomach's production 
        of acid rather than just neutralizing acid once produced. This was an 
        important medical advance that generated large social benefits and also 
        large expected profits for the firm that introduced it. Subsequently, 
        Zantac was introduced, a drug that accomplishes the same objective as 
        Tagamet, though with somewhat fewer side effects. The maker of Zantac 
        has made large profits, because its slightly superior performance has 
        allowed it to take much of the market away from Tagamet. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From a social point 
        of view, the introduction of Zantac had 3 effects. On the plus side, the 
        maker of Zantac has earned large profits, and consumers have gotten some 
        benefit from Zantac's superior features and price competition between 
        the two firms. On the minus side, the maker of Tagamet has <em><strong>lost</strong> 
        </em>a large stream of profits that it otherwise would have enjoyed. Altogether, 
        it is quite possible that the incremental social value of Zantac has been 
        quite modest, despite the fact that its maker has earned large profits. 
        Hence, in this case, the private rate of return to innovation likely <em><strong>exceeded</strong> 
        </em>the social rate. Given that significant research resources were devoted 
        to the introduction of this marginally valuable (from a social point of 
        view) innovation, it is quite possible that the social rate of return 
        to this innovation was actually negative. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More generally, the 
        introduction of a new technology will often make some previous investment 
        in R&amp;D obsolete. Part of the profits to the innovator can be thought 
        of as being taken away from the previous technological leader. This is 
        a negative externality, i.e. it is a negative social effect of research 
        that is not considered when a firm makes its own R&amp;D decisions. At 
        a purely theoretical level, it is possible that this effect dominates 
        the other two, so that the laissez-faire level of private R&amp;D is too 
        high rather than too low. In reality, the empirical evidence is overwhelming 
        that such is not the case, i.e. the net effect of the positive and negative 
        externalities is positive.<a name="Back to 9"></a><a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> 
        Nonetheless, the existence of this negative effect has some implications. 
        In particular, if we can identify situations where it is likely to be 
        unusually large, then we can surmise that these are situations where the 
        net spillover benefits are likely to be small or even negative, suggesting 
        that this would not be a good area for ATP funding. </font>

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="II.C"></a>C. Relationship 
        of Spillover Concepts to Existing ATP analysis</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spillovers are already 
        very much a part of ATP discussions and analysis, although different words 
        are sometimes used. In this Section, I will relate the terms and analyses 
        that are currently used to the spillover concepts as I have described 
        them. </font> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="II.C.1"></a>1. <strong> 
        Broad-based economic benefits </strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One explicit criterion 
        of project selection is the creation of broad-based economic benefits. 
        Under this criterion, the ability of a proposed project to enable new 
        economic activity is evaluated. The significance of potential market applications, 
        and their impact on productivity, employment, output and quality of life 
        (if applicable) are considered. Applicants are asked to discuss timing 
        issues, and to explain why ATP assistance is needed, what difference it 
        will make, and why taxpayer support is justified. The overall incremental 
        benefits created by the project are compared to its overall incremental 
        costs. Although economic benefits include purely private benefits, and 
        thereby encompass much more than spillovers, this analysis is also closely 
        related to the kinds of impacts on productivity, employment and output 
        that determine the magnitude of market spillovers. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As shown in Figures 
        2 and 3, knowledge spillovers also lead, eventually, to economic benefits. 
        One way to think of this is to view market spillovers as creating <em><strong>direct</strong></em> 
        economic benefits, and knowledge spillovers as creating <em><strong>indirect</strong></em> 
        economic benefits. Thus, at least in principle, both of these effects 
        would be a part of what is currently analyzed under the rubric of broad 
        economic benefits. </font>

        Enabling technology</strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concept of "enabling" 
        technology is widely used as a general description of the mission of the 
        ATP, and as a criterion for discussing individual projects. I believe 
        that the notion of enabling technology can be related to the concepts 
        of market and knowledge spillovers, and the important interactions between 
        the two. There are a number of different ways in which a technology can 
        be thought of as enabling. In this subsection, I consider different ideas 
        of enabling technology that are used within the ATP, and how each relates 
        to the spillover concepts that I have elucidated. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em><strong>Multi-use 
        technology</strong></em>. A multi-use technology is defined within the 
        ATP as "a technology that has many distinct applications." In the framework 
        that I have presented, a multi-use technology can be thought of as one 
        that generates many distinct paths of knowledge spillover. Referring to 
        figure 2, if the lower pathway that begins with "Other firms' knowledge" 
        being augmented by spillovers from the research of firm 1 is replicated 
        many times over, then firm 1 is generating multi-use technology. The many 
        different and distinct applications of a multi-use technology make knowledge 
        spillover likely, because the original developer of the technology is 
        unlikely to be able to pursue all of these distinct applications, suggesting 
        that others will likely pick up the idea and commercialize (and hence 
        profit from) many of the resulting applications. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One way a technology 
        can have multiple uses is where "proof of concept" is important. For example, 
        the attempt to develop a catalyst for a certain polymerization reaction 
        that is based on an entirely new mechanism could be a multi-use technology; 
        the successful demonstration of the validity of the new mechanism may 
        well allow others to develop new catalysts for a whole range of other 
        polymerization reactions. Another form of multi-use technology is where 
        improved performance of a specific component is the "bottleneck" preventing 
        higher performance in many different applications. The proponent wants 
        to make a quantum improvement in this component, and redesign <em><strong>one</strong></em> 
        of these applications to exploit the improved performance. But once the 
        improved component is available, all the other applications can be improved 
        as well. Thus a multi-use technology has significant knowledge spillovers 
        because it has a wide variety of distinct applications, not all of which 
        are likely to be implemented by the firm that successfully demonstrates 
        the first application. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <em><strong>distinctness</strong></em> 
        of the applications is important. If I invent a better automobile windshield 
        wiper, one might argue that this is a multi-use invention, as it can be 
        used on every car, truck, and tractor in the world. But these are not 
        distinct applications, by which I mean no significant additional research 
        has to be done to adapt the idea to these different uses. There is little 
        to stop me from making all of these sales myself (assuming I have adequate 
        manufacturing capacity). In contrast, when there are numerous distinct 
        applications, the time and application-specific knowledge that it takes 
        to undertake the application-specific research necessary to implement 
        the generic idea in different areas will make it difficult for any one 
        firm to capture all of these areas. This makes spillovers likely. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em><strong>Pathbreaking 
        technology.</strong></em> Another way in which a technology can be enabling 
        is to be "pathbreaking," defined as "a technology that induces revolutionary 
        change in existing fields or that promises to open up new fields of activity." 
        Whereas a multi-use technology can be thought of as one for which the 
        knowledge spillover impact is likely to be "wide," we can think of a pathbreaking 
        technology as one whose knowledge spillover impacts are "deep." That is, 
        the solution to certain stubborn technical problems can be expected to 
        open up a new line of technological developments, creating in the process 
        entire new markets or even new industries. It is extremely unlikely that 
        the firm that originally opens up this line will capture all or even most 
        of the economic benefits thereby created. As discussed below, for example, 
        the firm that invented the "CAT" scanner did not last long in the commercial 
        market, as subsequent products that built upon but improved the original 
        idea were marketed by other firms. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em><strong> Infratechnologies.</strong></em> 
        Tassey (1995) defines "infratechnologies" as "a set of 'technical tools' 
        for making the entire economic process more efficient, or, in some cases, 
        possible in the first place." Examples given by Tassey of infratechnologies 
        include standards, scientific and engineering data, measurement and test 
        methods, production practices and techniques, and interfaces. Clearly, 
        infratechnology as relevant to the ATP is a narrower concept. The ATP 
        defines infratechnology as "technology that supports the R&amp;D, production, 
        and business of entire industries." </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In my view, infratechnologies 
        can be thought of as generating two kinds of spillovers. First, development 
        of measuring and testing methods, interfaces, and certain production practices 
        have elements of network externalities. That is, these technologies often 
        have features that depend on the establishment of <em>standards</em> that 
        are shared by multiple industry participants. It does me no good to develop 
        an interface unless many others are going to use it. Similarly, the value 
        of measuring and testing methods is greatly enhanced when the same methods 
        are widely used, so that test results can be shared and used as the basis 
        for market transactions. For the reasons discussed above, activities that 
        have this element of the creation of standards, with the attendant network 
        externalities, are likely to be underprovided by competitive markets. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea of infratechnologies 
        appears, however, to be broader than just standards. Another dimension 
        is the development of technologies that are essentially <em><strong>inputs</strong></em> 
        to the research process. Even without the issue of standards, the development 
        of certain kinds of scientific and engineering data, or the creation of 
        measuring and testing instruments, facilitate the research process. One 
        way to think of this is to view infratechnologies as inventions whose 
        "market" is the research process itself. That is, the customers are other 
        researchers, and the market spillovers come in the form of increases in 
        the efficiency of others' research programs. Now, to the extent that the 
        research process <em><strong>generally</strong></em> involves the creation 
        of spillovers, the generation of market spillovers that come in the form 
        of more efficient research ought to generate particularly large social 
        returns, since the research endeavors that benefit will typically go on 
        to generate further spillovers. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, then, the 
        various notions of "enabling" technologies can be thought of as capturing 
        several specific mechanisms by which market and knowledge spillovers operate 
        and interact. As discussed in Section IV, understanding the significance 
        of these spillover pathways provides an analytical basis for evaluating 
        the spillover potential of proposed projects. </font>

        Necessity of ATP support</strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, an additional 
        element of the existing review process that relates to spillovers is the 
        necessity of ATP support. Conceptually, the existence of large spillovers 
        is one obvious explanation why a technically important project with significant 
        economic benefits might not be carried out without ATP support. Often, 
        the spillover connection is implicit rather than explicit: proponents 
        and/or reviewers will cite the diffuse and high-risk nature of the potential 
        benefits as reasons why private capital is not forthcoming, or note that 
        the project is not part of the proponent's core business. </font>

        OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE RELATING TO SPILLOVERS</font></h2>
      <p> 
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="III.A"></a>A. Estimating 
        rates of return and the magnitude of spillovers </font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A possible excuse 
        for the delay between the time Alfred Marshall talked about spillovers 
        and the time economists made serious efforts to measure them is that they 
        are inherently difficult to observe. As Paul Krugman has noted, "knowledge 
        flows...are invisible; they leave no paper trail by which they may be 
        measured and tracked, and there is nothing to prevent the theorist from 
        assuming anything about them that she likes" (Krugman, 1991, p. 53). As 
        a result, empirical measurement of spillovers is necessarily somewhat 
        indirect. Most analyses take the form of measuring the innovative effort 
        or output of one agent or set of agents, and looking for a correlation 
        between this measure and the innovative output of another agent or set 
        of agents. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To make such an analysis 
        tractable and meaningful, one must identify which agents are the likely 
        recipients of spillovers from particular research efforts. This typically 
        involves developing a metric for measuring the "closeness" of different 
        agents -- either in terms of technological similarity, geographic proximity, 
        or economic relationships, such as vendors and their customers. To infer 
        the existence of spillovers from a correlation between the research effort 
        of one group of agents and the research output of other agents that are 
        somehow "close," it is necessary to control for (1) the innovative <em><strong>effort</strong></em> 
        of the second group, and (2) variations in "technological opportunity" 
        that might be affecting the productivity of research effort for both the 
        "spilling" and "receiving" agents, inducing a correlation between an agent's 
        research success and the effort of other firms that need not be related 
        to spillovers. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies of this sort 
        allow the calculation of the "excess return" to R&amp;D investment, i.e., 
        the difference between the rate of return calculated including the effects 
        of the investment on the recipients of spillovers, and the rate of return 
        calculated excluding spillover effects. Depending on the nature of the 
        study, this excess return or spillover gap may encompass knowledge spillovers, 
        market spillovers, or both. In general, the spillover gap is found to 
        be positive, suggesting that the negative competitive externality is generally 
        outweighed by positive effects of knowledge and consumer surplus externalities.

        of market spillover</strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The oldest line of 
        work focuses on spillovers embodied in products and measures closeness 
        using supplier-customer relationships. For example, Terleckyj (1974) looked 
        at industry data, constructing a measure of "borrowed" R&amp;D for each 
        industry on the basis of the R&amp;D of the industries from which it purchased 
        intermediate inputs, including capital equipment. He found that the productivity 
        effects of R&amp;D in downstream industries implied an excess return to 
        industry R&amp;D of 20% to 50% (compared to a private rate of return of 
        about 30%). This measure of market spillovers may also contain an element 
        of knowledge externalities, to the extent that the downstream firms are 
        engaged in their own research and benefit indirectly from the research 
        of their suppliers. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scherer (1982 and 
        1984) took another cut at this problem. By examining patent data, he estimated 
        the fraction of inventions <em>originating in</em> each industry that 
        would be <em>used by</em> each industry. This allows the creation of a 
        "technology flow" matrix which can be used to allocate industrial research 
        by the industry in which it will be "used" regardless of the industry 
        in which it is performed. He shows that this "used" R&amp;D variable is 
        more strongly correlated with industry productivity growth than is a variable 
        measuring R&amp;D performed in the industry. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mansfield, et al (1977) 
        used a case study approach instead of looking at aggregate industry R&amp;D 
        statistics. They identified 17 specific innovations, and attempted to 
        estimate the actual cost and overall social benefits of each. In particular, 
        they took great care to analyze the impact of the innovations on customers, 
        and also on competitors. They did not, however, specifically seek to identify 
        knowledge externalities. For this group of innovations, the median private 
        rate of return was about 25% and the median social rate of return was 
        about 50%. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bresnahan (1986) and 
        Trajtenberg (1990) have quantified the consumer surplus spillover from 
        mainframe computers in the 1960s and the CT scanner in the 1970s. Bresnahan 
        calculates that between 1958 and 1972 financial service firms paid $68 
        million for computing services, but received benefits equal to $200 to 
        $400 million. This difference between the cost of the computers and the 
        benefits they created is a measure of market spillovers, and suggests 
        that the social rate of return to this innovation was several times the 
        private rate. Trajtenberg calculates that the social rate of return to 
        <em><strong>improvements</strong></em> in CT scanners averaged between 
        180 and 350 percent per year, depending on how foreign R&amp;D investments 
        are treated. While Trajtenberg does not calculate private rates of return, 
        approximately half of the producers, including EMI, the original innovator, 
        eventually left the business, apparently because of mounting losses. </font>

        Measurement of knowledge spillovers </strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In my 1986 paper, 
        I used patent data for about 500 manufacturing firms to characterize the 
        "technological proximity" of all pairs of firms on the basis of the extent 
        of overlap of technological classification of their patents. I then constructed 
        a measure of the "spillover pool" for each firm, as the sum of all other 
        firms' R&amp;D, weighted by their proximity to the receiving firm. I found 
        that the pool variable had positive effects on firms' patents, profits 
        and market value, all controlling for the firm's own R&amp;D. For patents 
        -- a purely technological measure of research output -- roughly half of 
        the aggregate impact of R&amp;D was in the form of spillovers, or, conversely, 
        the social productivity of research was roughly twice as great as the 
        private productivity. For economic measures of research output such as 
        profits, productivity and market value, I found that the spillover effect 
        was roughly half as large as the private return <a name="Back to 10"></a><a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> 
        </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interestingly, the 
        effect of the pool was found to be itself a function of firms' own R&amp;D. 
        The more R&amp;D a firm does itself, the more it benefits from spillovers 
        from others. With respect to profits and market value, firms that have 
        significantly less than the mean R&amp;D level actually suffer a negative 
        effect from the spillover pool. This is interpreted as saying that both 
        knowledge and competitive externalities are present, with the former outweighing 
        the latter on average, but the latter outweighing the former for firms 
        that do little R&amp;D themselves. </font>

        Summary of estimates of spillover magnitudes</strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Griliches (1992, Table 
        1) summarizes the results of many of these studies. He concludes "R&amp;D 
        spillovers are present, their magnitude may be quite large, and social 
        rates of return remain significantly above private rates." While all of 
        this work carries econometric limitations and presents only indirect evidence 
        that spillovers exist, the weight of the evidence does seem to be increasingly 
        convincing that spillovers create a large gap between the private and 
        social rate of return. There are two ways to look at this gap. In absolute 
        terms, it appears that the <em><strong>excess</strong></em> of the social 
        rate of return over the private rate --the rate of spillover -- is something 
        like 15 to 30 percent, with some estimates much higher than that. Another 
        way to look at this is relative to the private rate of return.<a name="Back to 11"></a><a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a> 
        Again, estimates vary somewhat, but spillovers seem to create a gap between 
        the private and social return that is equal to 50 to 100% of the private 
        rate of return. Note that the individual studies underlying these ranges 
        tend to emphasize either knowledge externalities <em><strong>or</strong></em> 
        market externalities. I can think of no study that, at a conceptual level, 
        is designed to capture both, although relationships between the two in 
        the data make it likely that each kind of study picks up some of the other 
        effect. Hence it is likely that these estimates have some tendency to 
        underestimate the combined effects.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="III.B"></a>B. Mechanisms 
        of Appropriation </font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In parallel to the 
        efforts to measure rates of return, economists have worked to understand 
        how firms respond to spillovers. U.S. firms spent about $100 billion of 
        their own money on R&amp;D in 1995, so they obviously think that there 
        are significant private returns to capture. This does not mean, as discussed 
        above, that the social return is not even higher, but it does suggest 
        that understanding the mechanisms by which firms "appropriate" the returns 
        to R&amp;D is likely to be helpful in understanding where and when spillovers 
        are likely to be large. From this point of view, spillovers are likely 
        to be largest when the mechanisms of appropriation are unavailable or 
        do not work well. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a broad conceptual 
        level, there are 4 important ways that firms appropriate the returns to 
        R&amp;D. <a name="Back to 12"></a><a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a> 
        First, to minimize knowledge spillovers, they can try to legally preclude 
        others from using knowledge that they create, through the use of intellectual 
        property protections such as patents, copyrights, and employment contracts 
        that attempt to prevent scientists and engineers who leave the firm from 
        using knowledge they take with them. Second, for certain kinds of new 
        knowledge, secrecy can be effectively maintained. Third, in some cases, 
        simply being first conveys sufficient advantage that an innovator can 
        capture a significant share of the benefits to innovation, even if the 
        knowledge is otherwise unprotected Finally, despite the simple model of 
        knowledge as a public good, economic exploitation of new knowledge often 
        requires other assets or abilities that may not be easily obtained or 
        duplicated. Investment in these "cospecialized" assets (Teece, 1986) may 
        allow an innovating firm to capture a larger share of the overall returns 
        to a new technology. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intellectual property 
        protection is most successful with knowledge that can be easily described 
        and codified. Thus patents tend to be most effective in the chemical industries, 
        including drugs, and in some industries based on relatively simple mechanical 
        technologies (Levin, et al, 1987).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em><a name="Back to 13"></a></em><a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> 
        Also, patents are generally viewed as more effective at protecting <em><a>product 
        </a></em>innovations than <em><a>process</a></em> innovations. Conversely, 
        secrecy is most effective in protecting tacit knowledge that is difficult 
        to codify (and hence difficult to copy), and is more useful in protecting 
        process innovations than product innovations. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="Back to 13">First-mover 
        advantages possessed by an innovator derive from two primary sources. 
        First, being the first to market a new technology may allow a firm to 
        create customer loyalty that protects profits to some degree even if other 
        firms eventually are able to imitate the new product. Second, for production 
        technologies where "learning curve" effects cause production costs to 
        fall as production experience is accumulated, the first firm to market 
        may garner a cost advantage that is dynamically self-sustaining. That 
        is, the first firm acquires production experience first, leading to lower 
        cost; this lower cost allows the first-mover to maintain a large market 
        share which serves to increase production experience and lower cost further. 
        </a></font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="Back to 13">Finally, 
        the need for cospecialized assets, such as large-scale production capability, 
        a network of sales and service organizations, a reputation for reliability 
        within a line of products, or the ability to navigate a maze of regulatory 
        approvals necessary to market some products may allow some innovating 
        firms to protect themselves from the more serious competitive effects 
        of knowledge spillovers. Conversely, for products where these assets are 
        important, firms that do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>possess them are 
        likely to have difficulty appropriating a large fraction of the returns 
        to their research. They will either have to license their technology to 
        a firm that does possess the other assets (giving up a significant chunk 
        of the profits in the process) or else knowledge spillovers make it likely 
        that they will soon face competition from other firms that can benefit 
        from the knowledge they have created, and which possess significant competitive 
        advantages in the marketplace. </a></font>

        IV. FRAMEWORK FOR EXPLICIT EVALUATION OF SPILLOVER POTENTIAL OF ATP PROPOSALS</a></font></h2>
      <p> 
      <h3> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="IV.A"></a> A. The 
        Underlying Criterion for Project Selection </font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is a generally 
        accepted criterion of public policy that expenditure programs should seek 
        to maximize the social rate of return of the expenditures they make. In 
        the case of the ATP, this basic objective is qualified by a number of 
        constraints, including a need to identify projects that produce enabling 
        technologies, that entail overcoming challenging technical difficulties 
        requiring a research agenda that pushes the state of the art of industrial 
        practice in the fields in question, and have the potential for significant 
        economic benefits to parties other than the project proponents. Among 
        projects satisfying these constraints, however, the ATP would like to 
        spend its funds to create the greatest possible social return. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maximizing the social 
        return on the ATP's investment is complicated by the possibility that 
        ATP funds may be partially or wholly displacing private R&amp;D resources, 
        implying that the social benefits of the research would have come about 
        without the ATP.<a name="Back to 14"></a><a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> 
        The possibility of displacement induces a distinction between the social 
        rate of return to the project and the social rate of return to the ATP 
        expenditure. If ATP funds a project with a high social rate of return, 
        but in so doing largely displaces private funds, then the social return 
        <em>to the ATP expenditure</em> (the public rate of return on the government 
        investment) will be low despite the high social return <em><strong>to 
        the project</strong></em>.<a name="Back to 15"></a> <a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> 
        Thus the danger of displacement means that what the ATP must try to do 
        is fund projects that have a high social rate of return, <em><strong>and</strong></em> 
        a low probability that ATP funds are displacing private funds. Of course, 
        the ATP can never know for sure the extent to which it is displacing private 
        funds, and project proponents have an inherent incentive to understate 
        the likely extent of displacement. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The difficulty with 
        simultaneously seeking projects with high social returns and low probability 
        of displacement is that many factors pointing toward high social returns 
        also point towards higher likelihood of displacement; conversely, factors 
        pointing towards low probability of displacement may signal low social 
        returns. The reason for this connection is that the likelihood and extent 
        of private investment in a project are going to be affected by its <em><strong>private</strong> 
        </em>rate of return. Any factors that tend to simultaneously increase 
        both the private and the social rates of return will tend to make the 
        danger of displacement high on projects with high social rates of return.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="IV.A.1"></a>1. <strong>Minimizing 
        displacement by maximizing the spillover gap</strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The path through this 
        dilemma is to look for factors that cause the social and private rates 
        of return to diverge: the presence of such factors signals the possibility 
        that social returns may be high at the same time that the risk of displacement 
        is low. Strong likelihood of research spillovers is just such a factor. 
        Hence by trying to identify project proposals where the likelihood of 
        spillovers is particularly high, the ATP will fulfill its statutory mandate, 
        and do so in a way that will yield a high social return by minimizing 
        the extent of displacement.<a name="Back to 16"></a><a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

        among the social rate of return, the private rate of return and the danger 
        of displacement are illustrated by Figure 4, which graphs the social and 
        private rates of return for various hypothetical projects. Obviously, 
        there will always be tremendous uncertainty <em><strong>ex ante</strong> 
        </em>about the private and social returns to a project. Conceptually, 
        Figure 4 should be thought of in terms of the <em><strong>expected</strong> 
        </em> returns, i.e., the magnitude of the return if successful, times 
        the probability of success. The public sector seeks to maximize the expected 
        social return, and the private sector seeks to maximize the expected private 
        return.</font>

        up on the diagram have higher social returns, in the absence of the displacement 
        concern and other constraints, the ATP would simply seek to find projects 
        that are as far up as possible. From the private sector point of view, 
        projects to the right (higher private return) are more likely to be funded, 
        all else equal. Of course, the likelihood of private funding for any particular 
        project will depend on its riskiness and the financial environment of 
        the project proponents. Although it is a gross oversimplification, for 
        the purposes of discussion I have arbitrarily divided the projects into 
        3 groups: "good" commercial prospects that are likely to be well-supported 
        by the private sector, "marginal" commercial prospects that are less likely 
        to be funded and may be funded at inadequate rates, and "poor" commercial

        (Their social rates of return exceed their private rates.) If the ATP 
        seeks to choose projects with the highest social rate of return, then 
        project "C" is the most desirable of these projects, and ought to be the 
        prime candidate for funding. If society as a whole faced an all or nothing 
        choice among these projects, we might want to choose C, since its overall 
        social rate of return is higher. But it is likely that C will be funded 
        by the private sector, whereas it is likely that A and B will not be, 
        or will be underfunded. If the ATP ranks projects based on the "spillover 
        gap," then projects A and B would indeed be favored over C. Hence if we 
        want the ATP to generate high returns from projects that would not otherwise 
        be funded, then we would be better off looking at the spillover gap than 
        the overall social return. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Project D illustrates 
        the extreme version of this problem. This hypothetical project generates 
        high social and private returns, but its net spillovers are negative. 
        This might be the profile of a product like Zantac that is highly successful 
        but drives out a close substitute technology. If we were to seek to select 
        projects only on the basis of social returns, this project would rank 
        as higher than A, despite the fact that its private rate of return exceeds 
        its social rate. The government has no business funding this project, 
        given that its net effect on all parties, other than the firm performing 
        it, is negative. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In reality, of course, 
        we will have only coarse estimates of the social rate of return <em><strong>or</strong> 
        </em>the spillover gap. The fact that these prospects can only be known 
        with great uncertainty strengthens the superiority of the spillover gap 
        over the social rate of return as a decision criterion. Although projects 
        like A do exist, there will in general be some correlation between the 
        private and social rates of return. For example, all else equal, both 
        rates will be higher for projects with higher success probabilities and 
        projects whose product (if successful) serves a larger market. If we focus 
        only on the social rate of return, then there is a danger that we will 
        fund projects that appear to have a high social rate of return, where 
        the only reason the private sector is not pursuing this project is because 
        its overall prospects (affecting both the private and social returns) 
        are being overestimated or overstated by the project proponents. If we 
        focus on the spillover gap rather than the apparent overall social rate 
        of return, we are less likely to step in to fund projects for which the 
        explanation for lack of private funding is that they are not really very 
        promising projects. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To state this point 
        slightly differently, the ATP decision process should recognize that its 
        information is imperfect, and that errors are going to be made. Further, 
        information that is available about a project ought to be examined not 
        only for what it says explicitly about social returns, but also for it 
        what it <em><strong>implies</strong></em> about the probability of errors 
        being made. In some cases, the "facts" being put forth to support the 
        likelihood of large social returns for a project are facts that equally 
        well support the likelihood of large private returns (e.g., a large market 
        for the resulting product). If these purported facts are true, then both 
        private and social returns from the project will be high, i.e. we will 
        be at points like C (or even D) in Figure 4. Now, the ATP cannot know 
        with certainty if the "facts" are really true, and cannot know why, if 
        they are true, the private sector would not fund the project on its own. 
        Logically, there are several possibilities: (1) the facts as presented 
        are actually false, i.e., the market is not really large or else the probability 
        of success is so low that the expected (social) net present value of the 
        investment is negative;<a name="Back to 17"></a><a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> 
        (2) the facts as presented are true, and the private sector knows it and 
        would, indeed, fund the project with or without government help; or (3) 
        the facts are true, and there is some reason why the private sector will 
        not fund the project (or will not fund it adequately or in a timely way) 
        despite the potential payoff. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some projects will, 
        of course, fall into category (3), but the ATP should be worried about 
        possibilities (1) and (2). This worry can be minimized by seeking a large 
        spillover gap, not just a large social return. If projects with apparently 
        high potential private returns are to be funded, there should be a careful 
        analysis of the reasons as to why the project is not being funded despite 
        its large potential payoff. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="IV.A.2"></a>2. <strong>Commercialization, 
        business risk and the spillover gap </strong> </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Point "A" in Figure 
        4 raises additional issues. This hypothetical project has good social 
        returns, but very low private returns. Because market size, success probability 
        and other factors tend to affect both private and social returns, projects 
        like "A" will come about only in cases where there are particularly strong 
        problems with appropriating the returns, leading to a large spillover 
        gap and low private returns. It is unclear what the ATP's attitude towards 
        a project like A should be. There is a large spillover gap, and a very 
        low risk of displacement, so this would appear to be a particularly good 
        funding prospect. The qualification of this conclusion rests on the observation 
        made above that the realization of spillover benefits from R&amp;D projects 
        will likely be dependent to a large extent on successful commercialization 
        of the output. Projects like A with very poor commercial prospects are 
        not likely to be commercialized, even if technical success is achieved. 
        Hence the danger with funding projects like A is that <em><strong>few</strong></em> 
        spillover benefits will actually be achieved, because commercialization 
        will never occur. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again, the realization 
        that information is imperfect complicates this analysis. Faced with a 
        proposal with apparently poor commercial prospects, the ATP will not know 
        for sure whether the project is really an "A" or a "B". In principle, 
        rational profit-maximizing companies obligated to share the cost of ATP 
        projects are not likely to propose projects like A. To the extent that 
        the cost-sharing burden is real, and the proponents can be trusted to 
        be acting to maximize profits, the ATP ought to ignore the danger of points 
        like A in its decision-making, seek to maximize the spillover gap, and 
        rely on the proponents to screen out projects where the private returns 
        are so low that commercialization is unlikely even if technical success 
        is achieved. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, 
        to the extent that companies cannot be relied upon to screen out projects 
        like "A," then the ATP must be concerned both with seeking a large spillover 
        gap <em><strong>and</strong></em> expected private returns sufficient 
        to make commercialization likely. For example, R&amp;D labs or research 
        divisions of large companies may not be disciplined effectively by their 
        management to pursue only commercially tenable projects. This means that 
        the ATP has to undertake the analysis necessary to ensure that proposals 
        from such organizations are not projects like "A" that are unlikely to 
        be commercialized and hence unlikely to produce significant spillover 
        benefits.<a name="Back to 18"></a><a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> 
        </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This issue is important 
        because, holding constant the size of the market for the potential output, 
        factors that inhibit innovators' ability to protect their innovations 
        will simultaneously increase the spillover gap <em><strong>and</strong></em> 
        reduce private returns. Thus, as discussed above, a project proponent 
        that has the ability to manufacture and market a new product successfully 
        is more likely to appropriate the returns than one that would have to 
        license the technology to others, or else become a competitor in a market 
        where it does not have a historical market presence. From the point of 
        view of spillover analysis, the proponent's lack of manufacturing and 
        marketing ability ought to increase the ATP's interest in a project (all 
        else equal), because it increases the likelihood of spillovers. On the 
        other hand, the lack of these other abilities may make the likelihood 
        of commercialization so low that the spillovers will never come about. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no resolution 
        to this dilemma except to separate the two issues. Analytically, the spillover 
        gap is important, and factors that are likely to inhibit a proponent's 
        ability to capture the returns to its innovations make spillovers more 
        likely. At the same time, it may be true that, in combination with other 
        factors affecting the business risk of a particular project, limitations 
        on the ability of the proponent to capture the returns could eventually 
        tip the balance toward a decision that the project, despite its spillover 
        potential, has too low a probability of commercial success for ATP involvement.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="IV.C"></a>C. Implications 
        for the Focused Programs</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As discussed above, 
        there are some areas of technology where, in addition to the market and 
        knowledge spillovers, there is an additional externality due to the dependence 
        of profitability for each of a set of related projects on some "critical 
        mass" of projects being successful. The existence of an area of technology 
        where projects interact via these network externalities yields an argument 
        for government action to solve the coordination problem that might otherwise 
        prevent any of the different research projects from being undertaken. 
        </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analytically, the 
        possible existence of network externalities can be seen as part of the 
        motivation underlying the creation of focused programs within the ATP. 
        Thus, the justification for the Component-Based Software program is not 
        that there is too little research effort devoted to developing new software. 
        Rather, there may be "enough" software development going on, but firms 
        are unlikely to expend significant resources on developing tools and capabilities 
        for the development of software "components," since the economic payoff 
        to the creation of such components is largely dependent on a wide range 
        of component availability, so that users can solve their overall applications 
        needs through the selection of such components rather than custom programming. 
        By creating a focused program, the ATP attempts to solve this coordination 
        problem, assuring each of the participants that the overall program activities 
        will create a reasonable chance that the component-based approach can 
        fly. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is difficult, however, 
        to assess the validity and importance of the network spillover arguments 
        for focused programs in a general way. The mere observation that uncoordinated 
        action is not likely to be optimal does not, by itself, reveal what the 
        coordinated action should be. There is a danger that government intervention, 
        despite the best of intentions, can lead to "lock-in" of a certain approach 
        that is not in fact optimal. Further, although the theoretical possibility 
        of network externalities is real, markets do manage to solve many coordination 
        problems. In other words, to determine whether and to what extent the 
        network externality phenomenon would justify a focused program in a particular 
        technical area requires careful analysis. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By noting the connection 
        between network externalities and the possible government role in solving 
        the resulting coordination problem, I do not mean to suggest that this 
        coordination role is the only reason for the existence of focused programs. 
        There may be other benefits to focused programs besides addressing the 
        network spillover problem. The effect of knowledge spillovers may be magnified 
        by having a number of researchers working on distinct but related projects. 
        There may be administrative efficiencies to having a set of related projects, 
        and developing the in-house expertise to understand and manage them. Finally, 
        in a world of extremely imperfect information, focused programs may be 
        necessary to ensure that potential industry participants are sufficiently 
        aware of the ATP and what it does in order to maximize the quality of 
        the proposals that the ATP receives. Because of these other considerations, 
        the value of focused programs need not ultimately rest on the network 
        externality argument. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In any event, the 
        existence of focused programs does not eliminate the desirability of choosing 
        individual projects that are likely to yield high spillovers. To the extent 
        that the conditions listed above will be the same for the various proposals 
        in any given focused competition, they will not serve to discriminate 
        among the proposals in a focused competition. Other considerations will 
        differ, however, so that the need to identify the spillover potential 
        of individual proposed projects is not eliminated by evaluating them in 
        the context of a focused program. </font>

      <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="VI."></a>VI. CONCLUSION</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to be effective 
        in achieving its statutory objectives, the ATP must try to determine which 
        projects proposed to it will generate large spillovers, and which will 
        not. Economists and other social scientists have identified certain aspects 
        of a project's technological and market environment that tend to be associated 
        with large or small spillovers. By incorporating the explicit analysis 
        of such factors into both project choice and evaluation of project impact, 
        the ATP can make better decisions </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This task is complicated 
        by the interaction of a number of factors that cannot be disentangled 
        from each other. With some loss of important details, the problem can 
        be summarized as follows: </font> 
      <p> 
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ATP wants 
          to fund projects that will have significant, broad-based economic benefits. 
          </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The ATP wants 
          to fund projects with minimal "displacement" of private R&amp;D funds. 
          </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In general, projects 
          with significant broad-based economic benefits will tend to be those 
          that also offer the potential for significant private returns. </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Project proponents 
          have better information than the ATP about the prospects for private 
          funding, and also have an incentive to conceal this information. </font> 
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The realization 
          of spillover benefits is likely to be heavily dependent on commercialization 
          of the research results, making a clear path to commercialization important 
          to likely success. </font> 
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Combining points 1-4, 
        the ATP should seek to fund projects that will have a significant economic 
        impact, <em><strong>and</strong></em> where there are specific attributes 
        of the project and its environment that make spillovers likely. Neither 
        of these conditions is sufficient in itself. Specific features of the 
        technology and the business and economic environment of the proposal that 
        make spillovers likely are crucial, both for ensuring that benefits from 
        this government expenditure will be widely felt, and for reducing the 
        likely extent of displacement. On the other hand, point 5 means that there 
        may be cases where the appropriability problems that create a large spillover 
        gap, when combined with other business aspects of the proposal, make the 
        likelihood of commercial success too low. To oversimplify, the ATP seeks 
        projects with large spillovers, but not projects where the spillovers 
        are so great that the remaining private return is insufficient to maintain 
        commercial momentum. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus there is an inherent 
        tension in the ATP decision-making process. We want project proponents 
        to be committed to a project, and to have reasonable prospects for commercial 
        success. A company that is going to do some research but leave it in the 
        laboratory is less likely to generate spillovers or large social returns; 
        hence projects that are unlikely to be commercialized do not achieve the 
        ATP's objectives. All else equal, however, anything that improves the 
        prospects for commercial success increases the expected profits or private 
        returns, thereby decreasing the spillover gap and increasing the likelihood 
        that ATP funding will displace private funds. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no way to 
        eliminate this tension, but recognizing it explicitly and separating the 
        issues of spillover potential and business risk should facilitate better 
        decisions. In evaluating business risk and the likelihood of successful 
        commercialization, it is appropriate that factors that support the proponent's 
        likely ability to appropriate the profits from the invention, such as 
        plans to protect inventions with patents, or the existence of a successful 
        marketing organization, would be considered a plus. Within the spillover 
        evaluation, however, it is equally appropriate that the feasibility of 
        patenting the output, or the presence of other appropriation mechanisms 
        such as a strong marketing arm, would be considered a negative factor 
        in determining the extent and likelihood of spillovers. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ultimate project 
        funding decision in any given case will have to depend on these considerations 
        placed in the context of the overall proposal. For a project whose direct 
        output is likely to be patented, the ATP may still determine that the 
        overall spillover potential is large, <em><strong>if </strong></em>there 
        are other considerations pointing towards large spillovers, such as a 
        technology with strong generic attributes. In the <em><strong>absence</strong></em> 
        of other spillover indicators, however, a project that produces an easily 
        patented output should be viewed as low spillover potential and hence 
        low priority for funding. On the other hand, in cases wheresuccessful 
        patenting is <em><strong>unlikely</strong></em>, this is an indicator 
        of potentially large spillover potential. If this indicator, together 
        with other aspects of the technology, creates a strong case for likely 
        spillovers, then the decision to fund could turn on whether, despite the 
        lack of patent protection, other aspects of the proposal or its proponents 
        provide the basis for concluding that the business risk is manageable 
        and successful commercialization likely. If so, then the project is a 
        good funding prospect; if not, it should be a low funding priority because 
        of the absence of commercialization mechanisms. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is an inherently 
        difficult and uncertain task, and it is one that requires an unusual combination 
        of technical, business and economic analysis. Perfect prediction cannot 
        be achieved, any more than it can be achieved for the purely technical 
        success of research. We know enough about spillovers to improve the ATP's 
        selection by a more systematic, explicit treatment of spillover effects. 
        Further research can improve and extend our knowledge of spillover phenomena 
        and how to measure them, in order to provide a firmer foundation for a 
        program with the mission, goals, and strategies of the ATP. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The empirical evidence 
        suggests that the <em><strong>average</strong> </em>research project generates 
        spillovers. If the ATP can succeed in targeting projects with <em><strong>better-than-average</strong></em> 
        spillover potential, then it will generate large social returns that would 
        not otherwise have been achieved. </font>

        </font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economists 
        use the term "consumer surplus" to describe the value that the purchasers 
        of a product derive from a product minus the price paid for it. If the 
        price of a product falls, consumers enjoy greater consumer surplus from 
        its consumption. If the quality of a product rises, and the price does 
        not rise commensurably, there is a similar increase in consumer surplus. 
        Thus what I am calling the "market spillover" amounts to an increasing 
        consumer surplus. </font></a>

        </font></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The term 
        "network spillover" is chosen because the different related research projects 
        are like the different users of a network. The value of a network to any 
        one participant is an increasing function of the number of participants; 
        here the expected value of any one research project is an increasing function 
        of the number of different projects undertaken. </font></a>

        cases, an innovating firm may not be in a position to utilize its new 
        technology, but will need to license or sell the technology to another 
        firm before the product or process can be implemented. In this case, imperfections 
        in the licensing market will generally result in an additional spillover 
        to the licensing firm. </font></a>

        firm 1 will have been earning profits and consumers gaining benefits before 
        the R&amp;D was performed; strictly speaking the returns are the <em>increased</em> 
        profits and <em>increased</em> consumer benefits. The figure ignores this 
        for simplicity. </font></a>

        would consist of the <em>incremental</em> profits and consumer benefits 
        created when other firms' research benefits from the knowledge spillover. 
        Again, this complication is ignored simply to keep the picture clear.

        If I synthesize a molecule that has never before existed, it is presumably 
        relatively easy to satisfy the "novelty" standard necessary to obtain 
        a patent, and also relatively easy to prove that someone else selling 
        the same molecule has infringed. Conversely, it may be hard to show that 
        a complex electronic or mechanical system is or is not substantially different 
        from what has come before. </font></a>

        sharing, then the project is being accelerated, but $300,000 in public 
        funds are producing only a $100,000 increase in research effort. Each
