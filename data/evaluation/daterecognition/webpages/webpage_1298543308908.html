  <DT><B>Spring Flounder at Gulf Passes</B>
  <DT>The basic relationship between flounder and fish passes is widely understood
  among coastal anglers. Flounder migrate through them into bays in the spring
  and out toward Gulf spawning grounds in the fall. The bulk of rod and reel
  pursuit of flounder occurs in and around these passes as the spring and
  fall &quot;runs&quot; take place.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>There is more to this flounder/pass connection than meets the eye however.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>For starters, from late February through mid April, it is best to target
  passes on an incoming tide. Flounder are not the best swimmers in the world
  and a strong incoming tide aids them in moving through the passes toward
  their inland territories. For many years, the ideology behind flounder
  fishing on the Gulf Coast is that it was a fall thing only and that outgoing
  tides and big cold fronts were the motivating force behind flounder migration.
</DL>
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD COLSPAN="3" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><DL>
  <DT>As knowledge of the spring run filtered through the fishing community,
  some anglers still carried the outgoing tide connection into spring fishing.
  This is not to say you cannot catch flounder on outgoing tides in the spring
  because you certainly can. The migratory aspects of the species and what
  I consider the best fishing is centered on the incoming tides.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>With that said one of the most overlooked areas during spring is on
  the outer edges of fish passes. These fish will stage on both ends of the
  migration and if there are &quot;eddies&quot; or areas of slack water on
  the outside of a pass, it will give flounder both a place to rest and eat.
  Small baitfish cannot negotiate strong tides very well and when they end
  up in eddies they tend to try and stick around them. Flounder have figured
  those out over the years and you will find lots of them in these eddies
  on the outside of passes.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>If the spot you are fishing, vertical fishing might be the only alternative,
  so try a heavy jigging spoon tipped with a piece of shrimp. If the waters
  are conducive to using the trolling motor you can cover the entire eddy
  within a few minutes. I recommend making small, slow lifts with the rod
  and allowing the lure to sink slowly. If there are flounder there, you
  should get a hit pretty quickly.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Although few anglers pursue flounder in the surf, there are quite a
  few flounder inhabiting the surf within a1/4 mile or so of big fish passes.
  These areas are extremely tidally driven and typically have more structure
  and a higher concentration of baitfish than other areas.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>As noted in my book, Flounder Fever, the typical drill for flounder
  is to stay out in deeper water in the surf during low tides and move into
  the shallows when it is high. That is actually quite typical of all predatory
  species, but for flounder, it is especially true.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>It is very difficult to find big schools of flounder in the surf. The
  fish usually scatter out, but there are places to look for them. To a novice
  a stretch of surf look like any other but to the experience angler there
  are dramatic differences and certain &quot;structure&quot; to consider.
  <DT>Let us start with points first.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Points are parts of the shore that extend into the water and they can
  be small or quite large. The most common configuration extends out at right
  angles to the beach. Occasionally the beach will turn and a &quot;point&quot;
  will look more like a &quot;bend but they are essentially the same things.
  Smaller points are less noticeable but still detectable by the current
  rips they produce or by the way the breaking waves crash on them.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Most anglers choose to fish at the tip of the point because that is
  where the most baitfish congregate and thus predators show up. Going back
  to the beach, the sides of a sandy point are good, especially in the &quot;pocket&quot;
  which is a depression crashing waves and current scoop out of the beach.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Bowls are another type of surf structure. Bowls typically indent into
  the shore and form between two points. Many bowls form in what many dedicated
  surf anglers call a &quot;teacup&quot; configuration. If you ever hear
  someone saying they caught fish in the &quot;teacup&quot; they are not
  speaking in codes but probably talking about a bowl in the surf. Some bowls
  are subtler and you can only seem them when tides are low and that bring
  up a good point. During winter months when low tides are common after northers
  go out to the stretch of surf you fish, bring a GPS and camera. Photograph
  the structure and mark it on the GPS. This will give you a huge advantage
  over other anglers who spend less time preparing and help you eliminate
  a lot of surf when the fish are biting around the spring run.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Fishing a bowl involves working along the edges and paying special
  attention to the upper rims or spots where the bowl makes a transition
  to a point. The center of a bowl can be great too because these are often
  the deepest points and in shallow surf sudden depth usually means fish.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Troughs or &quot;guts&quot; are the long depressions or ditches running
  parallel to the shoreline and sandbars. Surf anglers often talk about fishing
  between the sandbars which refers to fishing the troughs in the surf. The
  sandbars can either be the bottom between the troughs or an actual &quot;bar&quot;
  formed by current.
  <DT>In deeper water, flounder will feed along the sloping sides of a trough
  but in deeper surf, they feed in the center. Old timers say they gravitate
  toward the sharpest edge of the trough. Sand bars as we explained earlier
  are parallel the shore for great distances. For surf fishing for flounder,
  concentrate on the inner bars closest to the fish pass. Most surf fishing
  experts agree that fish feed along the outer sloping front side of bar.
  They tend to gravitate toward the bottom where the sloping front of the
  bar ends.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Some flounder never leave these passes (or at least they don't travel
  very far) after the spring run. A prime example can be found at Rollover
  Pass on the Bolivar Peninsula in Texas. This small piece is famous for
  its flounder runs but following suit with common knowledge, most of the
  flounder fishermen hit the area in the fall with a smaller, hardcore group
  targeting spring action.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>&quot;I catch flounder there from March through December and some of
  my best fishing for big fish is actually in the summer,&quot; said Nathan
  Spencer of League City, TX.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Spencer said that beginning in mid April through late September; big
  outgoing tides push flounder from the nearby Intracoastal into the southern
  end of the pass.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>&quot;A lot of those big fish like the deep water. That is why giggers
  like the stretch of shoreline between Rollover and the Stingaree area.
  When we get strong outgoing tides of any kind, good numbers of flounder
  move down on the side of the pass to feed,&quot; he said.
  <DT>Spencer targets them with live finger mullet on a fish finder (Carolina)
  rig finished off with a small treble hook through the lips of the bait.
  <DT>&quot;Flounder aren't really that hook shy and since I rarely catch
  undersize ones there I use a treble hook to increase my chances of getting
  the big fish. I don't like to miss many of those.&quot;
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Some anglers like to target flounder in the passes by simply throwing
  out a half dozen rods rigged with live bait on the bottom and simply let
  them sit. Most flounder fishing involves dragging bait across the bottom
  and literally hitting a flounder to grab their attention. This method more
  or less revolves around the theory that in passes during migrational periods
  flounder will be moving through and will come across your bait as they
  move through.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>A couple of years ago, I sort of stumbled into this method while launching
  at the Chicken Crossing in Sabine Pass. An elderly gentleman had a bunch
  of rods set out and when I asked him if they had caught anything, he pulled
  up an impressive stringer of flounder. He said when the fish were moving
  through the cut at Texas Bayou which were launching at during March, it
  was not surprising to have two or more fish on at the same time.
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT>Pass fishing for flounder can seemingly be very one-dimensional but
  for those who do not mind trying new things there are many ways to catch
  a stringer of flounder at their migratory points, even when the migration
  is not a factor.<BR>
