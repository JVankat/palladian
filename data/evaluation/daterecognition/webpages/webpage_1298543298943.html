<h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>Kenneth Galbraith has been at the center of the American economy since before the First World War. In this his new book, he offers a distillation of these years in both the public and the private sectors, the academy and the government, and explains where we are and how we got there. Galbraith argues that inherent in our economic system is a continuing divergence between reality and "conventional wisdom," or as he puts it self-serving belief and contrived nonsense, or "fraud." He contends that we observe the current state of the nation in a cloud of myth, believing that stockholders and owners run our corporate world. In reality, it is the management of giant corporations that controls not only the private sector, but also the public sector, too, from politicians, to the Federal Reserve Bank, to the Pentagon.<BR><BR>In a work filled with provocative ideas that come from his years as an astute observer, Galbraith looks at today's economy and America's military actions in Iraq and sees that the gap between myth and reality has never been wider.<BR><BR>Fraud within the American Economy:<BR>The myth of stockholder ownership<BR>The myth of a market economy<BR>The myth of the Federal Reserve System<BR>The myth of two sectors; public and private<BR>The myth that war is justifiable</p>

John Kenneth Galbraith has been immersed in economics for most of his long and remarkable life. The purpose of this extended essay is to illuminate examples of "innocent fraud" or the gulf between perception and reality in the modern American economic system--a system he had a hand in creating during his tenure in FDR's administration. Though tackling serious subjects, the book sparkles with wit and sly understatement. "A marked enjoyment can be found in identifying self-serving belief and contrived nonsense," he writes, clearly enjoying himself. <p>    The dominant role of the corporation in modern society is one such form of innocent fraud, and he explains how managers hold the real power in our system, not consumers or shareholders as the image would suggest. Despite the "appearance of relevance for owners," capitalism has given way to corporate bureaucracy--"a bureaucracy in control of its task and its compensation. Rewards that verge on larceny."<p>    He also explains how the public realm is effectively controlled by the private sector. The arms industry is but one example of this: "While the Pentagon is still billed as being of the public sector, few doubt the influence of corporate power in its decisions."  He also looks at the financial world which "sustains a large, active, well-rewarded community based on compelled but seemingly sophisticated ignorance," and in particular the Federal Reserve System, "our most prestigious form of fraud, our most elegant escape from reality." In essence, Galbraith says that the Fed, for all of its power and prestige, effectively does nothing. And he has little problem with this: "Let their ineffective role be accepted and forgiven."<p>    Both a guide to the present and an aid to shaping the future, this slim, satisfying book is a font of wisdom, conventional and otherwise, from a respected elder statesman in the twilight of his life. --<I>Shawn Carkonen</i>

<br>
In this thin volume, Galbraith, the noted economist and presidential adviser, serves up a pessimistic view of today's U.S. economy. Drawing on the omnipresent headlines of corporate scandal and greed, Galbraith explains that as the economy suffers, the overall state of American society declines as well. He points to a number of cases of "innocent fraud," or the gap between reality and conventional wisdom. The author bemoans the emphasis on gross domestic production, or GDP, rather than cultural or artistic advances. Companies, not the public, decide what products to make. Galbraith believes that decisions in various corporate arenas are made based on profits, rather than sound business strategies. Furthermore, he says that shareholder meetings, with a few rare exceptions, are pointless because "Shareholders-owners-and their alleged directors in any sizeable enterprise are fully subordinate to the management.... An accepted fraud." He also calls the rapid Internet growth and subsequent bubble another example of fraud as millions of analysts predicted rapid growth for so many companies, but ultimately many employees were laid off. Even more dismaying to Galbraith is the power of the Federal Reserve, which is credited with prompting economic resurgence when, in his view, the institution has limited real power. This brief treatise is a well-written, logical argument about the state of the economy. However, readers may be disappointed because the short concluding chapter offers few realistic solutions. <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

<br>
Galbraith, renowned economist, explains how economics and larger economic and political systems cultivate their own version of the truth. These "frauds" do not connect to reality, and although legal and not criminal, they reflect social and personal beliefs run amuck. He observes the notion that shareholders rule corporations when the power is now with managers. Labeling capitalism a market system makes the consumer appear to have sovereignty, yet the reality is that the market is subject to well-financed, skilled, and comprehensive management of the public response both in politics and consumerism. The economic and social dominance of big business is accepted, and the distinction between the public and private sectors has no meaning as corporate power extends to politics and government. In reality, corporations dominate our military, public finance, and the environment. As a prominent antiwar advocate, Galbraith believes war is a decisive human failure. This thought-provoking book will have wide appeal, including those whose politics and views differ from the author's. <i>Mary Whaley</i><br><i>Copyright &copy; American Library Association.

<span class="reviewtitle">Some of this is not so innocent<img height="11" width="56" name="pngImage" class="custReviewStars" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/associates/network/star50_tpng.png" alt="5"></span>
<br>This book is a 62-page essay on fraudulent aspects of the current economic and political reality in the United States as seen by an illustrious economist and one of the most influential men of our time.  Noteworthy is the fact that John Kenneth Galbraith was 95-years old when he wrote this a year ago.  Judging from the wisdom and clarity of his expression, I can only say (to recall a line from a Meg Ryan movie, if you will): "I'll have what he's having."
<br />
<br />I identified ten "frauds" as I was reading, but I think I may have missed one or two.  Before I list them and comment, let me quote the last line in the book because I think it is important: "War remains the decisive failure."
<br />
<br />Why Galbraith chose the word "decisive" is something of a puzzle.  Decisive for what or for whom?  Is he implying some sort of "decision" as regards humankind?  Does he think we are going the way of the dodos?  For myself it is clear that unless the war system is ended, most human beings will never progress beyond a tribal mentality, and will continue to suffer what Galbraith calls "death and random cruelty, [and the] suspension of civilized values..." (p. 62) 
<br />
<br />The "innocent" frauds that Galbraith calls to our attention are actually not all that innocent.   What he means by "innocent" is that for the perpetrators, there is "no sense of guilt or responsibility" as though the fraudulent were children.  Indeed from the perspective of Professor Galbraith's extensive experience and learning, many of the people who run our economies and our political systems are children.  At any rate, there is a somewhat lofty and even grandfatherly tone to this treatise.
<br />
<br />The first "fraud" is the use of the euphemistic "market economy" instead of the slightly stained "capitalism" to describe the present economic system.  (By the way, Galbraith does not number his frauds.  I do it for the sake of keeping them straight in my mind.)
<br />
<br />The second is the fact that in the modern corporation, ownership--that is, the stockholders--have little to no authority while the professional managers call all the shots including setting their own compensation (fraud #7).  Galbraith attributes this to the fact that corporations have become so vast and complex that the relatively unsophisticated ownership cannot really understand how to run the enterprise and so must yield to management.
<br />
<br />Fraud number three is one that interests me a lot.  Galbraith writes, "Reference to the market system as a benign alternative to capitalism is a bland, meaningless disguise of the deeper corporate reality--of producer power extending to influence over, even control of, consumer demand." (p. 7)  This really is one of the most pressing problems of our time because the corporate power, through its ability to influence and control its legions of employees and the media, also has "influence over, even control of" who runs for office and who is elected in national and state governments.  Indeed, in fraud #8 Galbraith notes that "A large, vital and expanding part of what is called the public sector is for all practical effect in the private sector." (p. 34)  He specifically identifies the "defense" industry as being largely controlled by defense contractors in the private sector.  Elsewhere in the essay, Galbraith refers to "the control of consumer choice and sovereignty" indicating that he understands that the control extends to the electorate. (p. 13)
<br />
<br />Fraud number four is the way we hypocritically value "work."  For some it is toil and for others it is a pleasure and indeed largely the reason for living, and yet how differently we are compensated, with those who need it least often getting the most in financial reward.
<br />
<br />Fraud five refers to the corporate bureaucracy.  While corporate people sneer at government agencies as being bureaucratic, large corporations have become just as bloated or even more so.  (Chapter V: "The Corporation as Bureaucracy.")
<br />
<br />Fraud #6 is the phony celebration of small businesses and family farms in the political rhetoric.  Galbraith comments, "For the small retailer, Wal-Mart awaits.  For the family farm, there are the massive grain and fruit enterprise and the modern large-scale meat producer." (p. 25)
<br />
<br />Fraud #9 (I've mentioned numbers 7 and 8 above) is the fraud of economic predictions.  Galbraith observes: "The financial world sustains a large, active, well-rewarded community based on compelled but seemingly sophisticated ignorance" (i.e., stockbrokers, stock analysts and other financial prognosticators).   He  adds, "...those...who tell of the future financial performance of an industry or firm, given the unpredictable but controlling influence of the larger economy, do not know and normally do not know that they do not know." (p. 40)
<br />
<br />Finally there is the quaint fraud of the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, which Galbraith claims have no real effect on the economy.
<br />
<br />For an interesting book on the corporation as a psychopathic entity (yes, psychopathic) see, The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power by Joel Bakan.  In fact Galbraith should read this book.  It would further part of his thesis.
<br />
<br />In part this modest book is a succinct warning about how corporations are becoming more and more powerful as they gain greater and greater control over our lives.  Perhaps what Galbraith is saying in his laconic way is that there is a very real danger that bit by bit we are on the way to a nation controlled not by a democratic electorate or even by republican checks and balances, but by an oligarchy of corporate power.

<br>Although professor Galbraith has little proclivity for numbers not all economic ideas are best expressed as such. To reach the masses one must present simple valid arguments with suitable justification for assumptions.
<br />
<br />Dr. Galbraith does just this in his essay.
<br />
<br />He makes explicit what the masses know implicitly especially in light of Enron, Worldcom, ad infinitum.
<br />
<br />Contrary to what some readers have posted ( I sometimes wonder if they actually read the book ) the author does not advocate "socialism, marxism," etc ( as if these terms had an unambiguous meaning ) but simply points out certain beliefs prevalent in society and proceeds to show that they are indeed myths. Some beliefs he clearly states are "innocent" by-products of circumstance.
<br />
<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book unable to put it down until it was read. I can only hope Dr. Galbraith continues to publish and provide us with his unique perspective.</p>

<br>John Kenneth Galbraith says he had fun writing this compact treatise, but it makes for painful reading. The much-honored Harvard professor claims that the gap between common wisdom about national economics and reality has widened alarmingly in recent years.<p>The center of the book's thesis is that what we once called "capitalism", and now usually call a "Market System", has morphed into a "Corporate System" controlled by management bureaucracy. Here are two short fragments to give the flavor of Galbraith's tract:<p>Myth: Shareholders own corporations.<br />"No one should be in any doubt: Shareholders-owners-and their alleged directors in any sizable enterprise are fully subordinate to the management. Though the impression of owner authority is offered, it does not, in fact, exist."<p>Myth: The public sector is entirely independent of the private sector.<br />"At this writing, corporate managers are in close alliance with the President, the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense. Major corporate figures are also in senior positions elsewhere in the federal government; one came from the bankrupt and thieving Enron to preside over the Army."<p>In earlier times, this book would have been burned in the public square. These days, it may simply be pushed off the bookshelves by a blizzard of withering reviews.</p>
