<P class="Body-Text-P" style="margin-top:0px"><span class="Body-Text-C">I was born in Escanaba, Michigan at St. Francis Hospital. We had a home in the country
    about seven miles outside of town. Lake Michigan was not far from my home and when
    I came to Illinois, I wondered where all the lakes and trees were, not anywhere in
    sight that I could see. So much flat land that it did not seem to be enriched with
    green trees and overflowing water.</span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">All my life I searched for the meaning of God’s love in my life. When I was in grade
    or high school, I remember only one time before going to Midnight Mass on Christmas
    Eve that the thought about becoming a Sister came to my mind. However, I did not
    know any religious sisters and it never came to mind after that one instance. My
    parents were people of faith. They brought us up in the Catholic Church. We went
    to Mass every Sunday and when I was younger we would pray the family rosary. My mother
    was a convert; at the age of sixteen she turned Catholic against her parents’ wishes.
    However, as I was growing up, I remember going to Church and wondering why God was
    so far out of reach. I approached Him as someone you honored, but not like a Father,
    as Jesus would say “Abba,” a father who cares for all our needs lovingly. I was shy
    but enjoyed life. Mom and dad were good to us and loved us. We did a lot of simple
    things together as a family. </span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">As life went on and after graduation, I began working in the cafeteria at the hospital
    in Escanaba. My mother got ill and our family was wounded. It gave our whole family
    a helpless and scared feeling. I experienced many emotions such as anger, frustration
    and so on. I would go to church on Tuesday evening and make a novena to Our Mother
    of Perpetual Help and ask Mary to intercede for our family. I searched for God’s
    love and wondered if He was really real in my life. Mary brought me to the feet of
    Jesus in prayer. There was a picture of Jesus in the Agony of the Garden on the wall
    next to where I would sit in church. After a while I could feel the strength from
    Jesus’ pain carrying me through and giving me hope that someone does care.</span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">Working at the hospital was a good experience for me. I was making new friends and
    even started to date the cook. It was fun renting a house and learning to be on my
    own. I always thought I would get married and have six children because I loved children.
    Sister Amadeo was in charge of the Dietary Department where I worked. We would have
    fun. She was a great cook and at times our whole dietary staff would have meals together.
    She would bring us together like a family, which brought much joy to our hearts.
    She would encourage me to become a Sister but at that time I did not feel the call
    to religious life. I began to attend daily Mass at my parish church and felt a desire
    to develop a closer relationship with Jesus. God planted a seed in my heart that
    needed to grow. He fed it with His own body and blood in the Eucharist. What a gift!
    &nbsp;To this day the Eucharist is the center of my life. Without receiving Christ, I
    could not strive to live for Him and glorify the Father.</span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">As time went on I felt a longing and persistent desire in my heart to answer “yes”
    to God’s call to enter religious life. I began to speak to Jesus as a friend in my
    heart and would tell Him I would not make a good sister. I am too weak and not very
    intellectual. However the desire continued to grow in me and I would pray and ask
    God to help me do what he was asking of me. Finally I realized that I would find
    Jesus’ love and peace by responding to His invitation to enter the convent. At that
    time I worked for The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis. Even though I was
    frightened about the idea of becoming a Sister, courage was not one of my virtues,
    only God’s strength would guide me through my life’s journey of faith. The Sisters
    helped me understand that God does call people to consecrated life, even if they
    are not highly educated or perfect. The Lord wanted me in my humanness, and through
    my weakness He would bring His strength.</span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">I remember one day being at a laundromat and seeing an ad about buying a book on
    bible stories. I always longed to read about Jesus in the bible so I mailed the form
    and expected to get something through the mail. One evening, a knock came at my door
    and when I answered the door there was a middle age man who wanted to talk to me
    about the bible. He shared some of the Scripture stories with me and his vocation
    story. I talked about God’s love and that I was going to enter religious life. It
    gave me a sense of peace sharing my story with him. Before he left he told me to
    never lose what I had. At that time I wondered what he meant. As time went on, I
    realized that he meant the gift of faith. God gives us the gift of faith and we must
    respond to this gift daily by putting all our trust in his promise of being with
    us always.</span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">The preparation for entering the convent was not without its challenges. I needed
    to get a priest’s recommendation and have interviews with the Major Superior and
    the Formation Director. I volunteered at the Hospital after work and on week-<wbr>ends
    so I did not get involved in many activities at the parish where I was registered.
    The priest knew me from attending daily Mass and receiving the Sacraments but not
    personally. After three attempt of getting an interview with Father, we talked and
    he was very nice. He said he could give me a recommendation on the spiritual part
    of my life but they would have to talk with Sister Amadeo for the personal recommendation.
    He encouraged me to look into other religious communities; however, I knew that I
    found the one that was meant for me. </span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">On August 15, 1976, I entered the convent. The novitiate was the springtime of my
    religious life. I loved my classes on Scripture, Franciscan Spirituality and many
    other classes that taught me more about my Catholic faith and on living consecrated
    life. We had Mass everyday and prayed the Divine Office together and had time for
    personal prayer. I worked in different areas in the convent and got to know and enjoy
    the Sisters. We had fun together no matter what we were doing. The grounds at the
    Motherhouse are beautiful, just walking outside and quietly enjoying nature made
    my heart sing to the Lord in silence. St. Francis always felt an oneness with creation
    and that seem to radiate through my being. The novitiate set the foundation for living
    my consecrated life. I made my first religious retreat in the convent and through
    the years I came to love being on retreat and strived to silence my heart and listen
    to the voice of my Lord deep within my being. Only by spending time with the Lord
    can I deepen my relationship with Him and receive the wisdom to walk in the footsteps
    of Christ. </span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">After the years in the novitiate and taking my First Temporary Vows, I went to St.
    James Hospital in Pontiac, IL. It was there I took my Licensed Practical Nurses training.
    I prayed, worked and had fun with our Sisters there in community. I took care of
    God’s people. As our Foundress, Mother Frances Krasse said, “Nurse the sick with
    the greatest care and love then God’s blessings will be with you.” I loved caring
    for the sick.</span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">On February 11, 1984, I made profession of Perpetual Vows after the homily during
    the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. I rejoiced in being united to my bridegroom for life.
    I pronounced the Vows of Consecrated Chastity, Poverty and Obedience to God, to the
    Church and to our Franciscan Community forever. The Bishop placed a silver ring signed
    with the crucifix on my right index finger. My whole life would be lived for God
    alone! In the silence of my heart, I heard God say, “I have called you by name; you
    are mine…” (Is. 43:1).</span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">Each day I live out my consecrated life. A commitment of love, filled with many challenges,
    that needs to be lived day by day. After professing Final Vows, I was missioned to
    Rockford, IL at Saint Anthony Medical Center and worked as a Licensed Practical Nurse
    for about two years and then in Pastoral Care Services for twenty years. Late in
    October of 2006, I was missioned to our Motherhouse in East Peoria to serve as secretary
    to our Congregation and was placed on the boards of our OSF Healthcare System. </span></P>
<P class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">Our Lord has been good to me. He provided the strength and comfort in the challenging
    years and blessed me with much joy and happiness as I continue to serve Him in whatever
    service he calls me to. I often think of Mother Teresa and how she would bring out
    in her writings, “smile no matter what comes your way,” She took care of the poorest
    of the poor. A great gift from God! My life is a journey of faith and trust in God’s
    providence. I ask Mary to help me seek to do God’s will in all things and be a true
    handmaid of the Lord. He loves us so much and desires that we all come to him and
    rest in His love. Often I pray to Saint Padre Pio and ask him to intercede to deepen
    my devotion to the Eucharist and assist us in caring for the poor, sick, injured
    and dying. A life of faith is seeking to live deeper into the heart of Christ with
    the Father and Holy Spirit which means a reaching out to others and bringing them
    into the Divine Family of Love.</span></P>
