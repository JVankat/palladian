				ON the evening of September 11 this year, a small circle of American diplomats and soldiers stood around the main flag pole at the US embassy in Kabul performing a quiet ceremony in memory of the attack seven years earlier that brought the Americans here to Afghanistan.

		<p>One flag after another was run up the flagpole, left there for a few seconds, then pulled down again to be wrapped up as a memento for families of the 9/11 victims or other Americans wanting to remember the attacks that prompted the US invasion of Afghanistan.<br /><br />"This flag flew over the US embassy in Afghanistan on 9/11" was the message that each flag bore.</p><p>About 40m away another flagpole fluttered with a more surprising ensign, the green and yellow boxing kangaroo that became famous during the America's Cup campaign of 1983. When I asked the diplomat who was leading me to the US ambassador's apartment for a press briefing what that flag was doing there, she hesitated for a few seconds, then lied. "Oh, it's just a gift some Aussies gave us," she said. That did not sound right, so three times I asked again, and each time she insisted the flag was flying there for no particular reason.</p>

		<p>The truth is that Australia's embassy works out of the US embassy and American diplomats have been asked not to tell anybody. On the website of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, this is the only Australian diplomatic presence in the world for which the address is withheld. Call Canberra and ask consular officials or DFAT press spokesmen and they will refuse to tell you where Australia's diplomats are based in Kabul. Foreign Minister Stephen Smith issued a statement earlier this year saying the diplomats had temporarily moved into the US compound after the bombing of the hotel where they had been based, but DFAT refuses to acknowledge that they are still there.</p><p>The boxing kangaroo is fluttering away because it is against US regulations to fly the official flag of another nation over a US embassy. The secrecy is hardly a matter of security because the US compound is the most protected piece of real estate in the country.</p><p>"It's actually about political appearances," a US official explained later. "Your Government doesn't want it to look like you are a branch office of our embassy."</p><p>The coyness surrounding our secret embassy says much about the state of the conflict in Afghanistan. The war is going poorly, its popularity is falling in Australia and there is widespread uneasiness about Washington's leadership. In fact, a week of briefings in Kabul with military and civilian leaders from the US, multilateral organisations, other countries and Afghanistan found a lack of clear leadership, blurred lines of command and confused strategies as NATO, the US, the UN and two dozen military allies operate with their own visions, aid plans and rules of military engagement. There is no agreement on how to spend aid, how many troops should be deployed or where they should come from, how to respond to the opium industry, whether the local government should be reaching out to the Taliban and how to deal with Pakistan.</p><p>Many of these policy splits can be found within the US administration, let alone between foreign nations, multilateral bodies and the Afghan Government.</p><p>The top US officer, General David McKiernan, says for instance that there can be no resolution in Afghanistan without first dealing with the support the Taliban receives from Pakistan. US ambassador William Wood disagrees, saying Pakistan is not an essential element in solving Afghanistan's problems.</p><p>On the issue of heroin Wood, whose previous posting was cocaine-producing Colombia, made it clear during the briefing in his apartment that night that he would like to see aerial spraying to wipe out opium crops. The British, who have taken the lead in fighting opium, firmly oppose spraying for fear it would push ordinary farmers towards the Taliban.</p><p>The UN's top envoy, Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide, complains with some exasperation that a fundamental problem is the tendency of the two dozen nations with military presences to direct their aid spending to the provinces where their own troops operate. "They want to stabilise the areas where their own troops are but that is unfair to the other regions and is not the most effective way of spending money." It is like "looking at the map of Afghanistan through a straw" and has allowed the Taliban to make a comeback in some of the neglected provinces, he says.</p><p>Mohammed Ehsan Zia, the Rural Development Minister and one of Afghanistan's most effective ministers, agrees with Eide that it would be much more productive to distribute aid nationally. "The problem now is it has become impossible to co-ordinate all these different programs. In Oruzgan (the southern province where Australian and Dutch troops are based) we don't even know what sort of projects are being done by the Dutch and Australians and we don't know how much money is being spent."</p><p>While the Dutch target most of their aid at that province, Australia directs only about 10per cent of its overall spending there. But the Australian Government has stationed its one Afghanistan-based Ausaid officer inside the fortified Dutch-Australian base next to Oruzgan's biggest town, Tarin Kowt, so he can co-ordinate Australia's development projects with the work of the Australian troops.</p><p>There is little doubt that he would be much more effective if he were working in a more secure province where he could move around more freely or even if he were liaising more closely with the Afghan Government by working out of that mysterious embassy that DFAT says is "somewhere in Kabul".</p><p>THE simple, nimble kites made famous by the novel The Kite Runner are busily dipping and diving over the streets of Kabul, a sign of normality in an increasingly nervous city.</p><p>Vendors push carts of nuts and fruits down noisy streets and restaurants defy electricity shortages and the growing security dangers by staying open for wealthy locals and the city's cautious band of foreigners.</p><p>Occasional suicide bombings in the capital and the advance of Taliban attacks closer and closer to Kabul have left foreigners jittery and often relying on armed guards and flak jackets. When I was driven near the main US base in the city centre, we were detained after one of the thousands of private security contractors working for the foreign forces spotted a camera in our car. We were not released until our irises were scanned and our hands checked for chemical residues of explosives.</p><p>Kabul businessman Nasrullah Rahmati rarely travels without a bodyguard but says his biggest security threat is not suicide bombers. "I have been robbed at gunpoint by our own police and I am more scared of them than I am of the Taliban," he said in his factory, where 250 workers make uniforms.</p><p>Afghanistan's politicians and government officials are as corrupt as the police, locals say, and a striking feature of Kabul is the "poppy palaces", mansions being built by strangely wealthy locals in a country that ranks behind only Somalia on the UN's list of the poorest and most dysfunctional countries. A British official working against the heroin trade jokes that the mansions are triumphs of "narchitecture". What is not so funny is the corrosive effect open corruption and poor governance have on the Afghan Government's legitimacy.</p><p>It seems to be conventional wisdom in Kabul that President Hamid Karzai's brother Ahmed Wali Karzai is an important drug dealer, a view many US officials privately share. Installed by the Americans, then endorsed in national elections, Hamid Karzai is likely to retain US support in elections due next year despite his ineffective rule. Karzai certainly has been a disappointment to the relatively few educated liberals in Afghanistan, who say he is not the champion of liberal democracy that he seems to many in the West. He has not championed women's rights with any great vigour and local journalist union officials say he warned them some time ago that his support for free speech did not extend to issues relating to the Islamic faith. When death sentences were pursued against two men for publishing unapproved translations of the Koran, the President offered only a muted response.</p><p>FORTY kilometres northeast of Tarin Kowt is the township of Chora. Viewed from a helicopter gunship as one flies over the barren, sand-coloured mountains of Oruzgan, it suddenly appears as a lush oasis at the juncture of several strategically important valleys. Its main street is a row of dilapidated mud huts with a dozen or so shops, a medical centre and a school. Donkeys and goats wander the street while men in traditional dress lounge in shop entrances and nod to a passing patrol of Dutch soldiers.</p><p>A 108-strong Dutch infantry company maintains a forward patrol base near an Afghan National Army camp on the edge of Chora, the type of mid-size town that the Karzai Government and its Western allies must make their own if they are to have any chance of holding more than just Kabul.</p><p>Children wave and try to practise their English with the Westerners. Men occasionally come up to ask for work or reconstruction contracts and one stern middle-aged man insists on trying on my sunglasses. Asked how the locals view the foreigners, a Dutch officer says: "They see us as money, money on legs."</p><p>But even here, almost in the shadow of the Dutch base, the Taliban are strong enough to make most adults nervous about being too closely aligned with the Government.</p><p>In the small, white-washed medical centre, which was built by a Dutch aid group, a tired 30-year-old doctor expresses frustration that many locals still will not visit the clinic for fear of Taliban retribution.</p><p>"People, especially women, are told they will be punished if they come here," the doctor says. "Lately the Taliban (has) been threatening the families of my trainee nurses and if I am not careful they will cut my head off. They kill doctors because they do not want development of the country. Even my patients could inform on me for talking to the Dutch."</p><p>After giving the liaison officer from the visiting Dutch patrol a list of new supplies and equipment he would like for the clinic, he asks a personal favour. It is coming up to his holiday and he would like a lift in a helicopter to Tarin Kowt. It is dangerous for an educated man to ride the bus because the Taliban regularly kidnap passengers seen as too close to the Government. Without making any promises, the liaison officer says he will see what he can do.</p><p>Oruzgan is the birthplace of Mohammad Omar, the Taliban's founder, but it is neither the safest nor the most dangerous province in Afghanistan. Bamyan to the north, where New Zealand soldiers are based, had two insurgent attacks earlier this year, while the Canadian-patrolled Kandahar to the south had 552. Oruzgan had 91, mainly roadside bombs.</p><p>Yet the security situation is still so fraught that the only Western aid workers who are willing to be based outside the Western military base at Tarin Kowt are four nervous Europeans from the German development agency GTZ who have set up an office in Tarin Kowt guarded by a South African security consultant. A German member of the group says they are instinctively determined to have as little to do with the military as possible. "We have to remain independent. The problem is it is not so safe doing that."</p><p>Commissioned by the Dutch Government to build a 40km road from there to Chora, GTZ has decided the project is too dangerous, so it plans to build part of the road, then hope that things improve. Typically enough, the Dutch officer commanding the patrol base in Chora knows nothing about that plan and has not even been contacted by GTZ for advice on security in Chora.</p><p>Afghan aid workers have been able to operate more safely. Amanullah Atif, a provincial officer for Equip, a Western-funded aid group linked to the Afghan Education Ministry, says that if his group had the money that the Australian military was spending building schools it could build more schools more quickly and would ensure that those schools were better used by communities by co-ordinating more closely with the locals.</p><p>A school built by the Australian troops in Chora, for instance, has been under-used because inadequate consultation saw it fall foul of local tribal rivalries, according to Atif. The Australians say they built the school between two tribal areas to try to bring the communities together but acknowledge that there could have been more consultation.</p><p>Ringed by razor wire and high walls, the Dutch patrol base was next door to the compound of the district governor, Rozi Khan, a popular and well-connected ally of President Karzai. Time did not permit me to visit Khan's office and it would be the last chance to interview him. A few days later he was shot and killed in Tarin Kowt by Australian troops who mistook him for an insurgent.</p><p>AHMED Shah is one of the more encouraging faces of Afghanistan's future. The 22-year-old army sergeant is a trainer at the Kabul Military Training Centre, working to churn out competent soldiers in a US-funded scramble to strengthen the local armed forces. Washington has belatedly realised that the quicker it can build up Afghanistan's own security forces, the more chance it will have of stopping the Taliban's resurgence and shifting much of the fighting burden on to local troops.</p><p>Iraq, which has fewer people, smaller territory and less hostile terrain, has an army of 255,000, but the Afghan National Army numbers only 65,000. The goal is to double the ANA in as little as two or three years, so Shah and his fellow trainers are working harder than ever on the dusty drill squares, shooting ranges and training fields at the KTMC.</p><p>Shah says relying more on ANA troops will also help to keep the public onside as local troops are much less likely to kill civilians. "Our enemies like to hide among the people and the foreigners often do not know who is an insurgent and who is a civilian. Anyone wearing our uniform knows who the enemy is. We need better equipment and more weapons, but we are very keen to defend ourselves so soldiers from other countries can go home."</p><p>The recruits are partly attracted by the wage of $100 a month - one-third of what the Taliban pays but three times the national average - but Western military trainers say they are committed, brave and natural fighters. Many of them have fought in tribal conflicts since the age of 15.</p><p>The greatest shortcoming of the recruits is that most cannot read. Unlike Iraq, Afghanistan has a huge shortage of skills and education. The national literacy rate is 28per cent, and just 18 per cent for women, so many government departments lack the basic competence to deliver services.</p><p>"In the whole country we do not have a single team of Afghan engineers capable of organising a major water and energy system," Rural Development Minister Zia says. While Western aid efforts in Afghanistan are generally labelled reconstruction programs, the reality is that they are often trying to introduce services that were never provided in the first place. The dilapidation shows up in a thousand ways, from civil servants who do not have the basic computer skills needed to operate a half-modern bureaucracy, to the fact even Shah's most senior superior officers must sleep in their offices for lack of proper dormitories.</p><p>Some Western generals estimate that the ANA is at least a decade away from being able to operate without the support of its Western allies but it is already the most professional and respected institution in the country. A depressing contrast is the Afghan National Police, which generally has been the frontline force dealing with the Taliban and the Afghan public, with equally disastrous results. The country has no tradition of effective, corruption-free policing and little progress has been made in the past seven years.</p><p>In many cases Karzai appointed favoured warlords as provincial governors, and in the words of one US general "that meant the warlord's top henchman became the chief of police and their militia became the police". Police wages were routinely siphoned off by politicians and police chiefs, leaving policemen to bribe and steal for a living, making the Taliban look more attractive to many Afghans.</p><p>In Chora I met one policeman who is notorious for putting on his uniform and turning up for work only on payday. Even the warlords who missed out on government posts have adapted to Western commercial ways; more than one private militia has suddenly been rebadged a "security contracting firm" available to the highest bidder.</p><p>Germany initially was responsible for retraining the police force, but US officials complain privately that the German program was more appropriate for "teaching a traffic cop in Dusseldorf" rather than stamping out corruption and giving the police the fighting skills to deal with the Taliban.</p><p>The US military has taken over the police retraining program but senior officers concede that "it is going to take us a generation to make real headway", and they bitterly regret their slow start.</p><p>US President George W. Bush's defiant declaration just before the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 that "we're not into nation building, we're focused on justice and we are going to get justice", was followed by several wasted years before the Americans realised that they do indeed need to build the basic mechanisms of a functioning nation-state.</p><p>FOR a school principal who relies on the support of the Karzai Government and Western military forces, Haji Brahim is quite open in praising the Taliban who used to rule Afghanistan. "They were interested in education and they built this school," says the black-turbaned head of the largest school in Chora during a visit by a Dutch military patrol. "I think there was too much emphasis (under the Taliban) on teaching religion rather than other subjects like English and chemistry, but nowadays we don't teach enough religion."</p><p>Brahim is no fervent liberal. He served quite happily as school principal under the Islamic hardliners who ran the country in the 1990s and, while he says it is good that girls are allowed to attend school, his administration has increased the female student body to just 35 out of 1393 students.</p><p>He draws a sharp line, though, between the original Taliban and the more diverse mix of insurgents who are fighting the Karzai Government. "There are still good Taliban who want to develop the country but they are not in control of the Taliban any more. Eighty per cent of them now are enemies of Afghanistan, mainly from Pakistan. Last week a convoy of books coming here from Kabul was destroyed by the enemies of Afghanistan. Why would anybody who loved their country want to destroy books?"</p><p>The insurgents who are lumped under the Taliban label include many more Afghans than people such as Brahim would like to admit. Surprisingly little is known about them, but they are a mix of locally born Islamic extremists and foreign jihadis with what some US generals call the "small-t" Taliban: mercenaries, criminals and relatively moderate nationalists. Oddly enough, one person whose name never crops up in official briefings about the insurgents is Osama bin Laden, the man whose capture was the main aim of the 2001 invasion.</p><p>Guy Dolmans, commander of the Dutch base in Chora, says his troops have seen no sign of foreign fighters. "We keep hearing about Chechens being here fighting, but my assessment is that there are no foreign combatants here at all," he says. "In fact I'm 100 per cent sure we have not encountered Chechens. They go in for more conventional military attacks and are good snipers. What we see is more asymmetric, people who are not highly trained firing a shot in our direction, then running off. I think we are dealing with a hard core of travelling Taliban supported by locals who will make an attack and then bury their weapons and go back to farming."</p><p>The divisions within the insurgency have become the focus of the desperate Western search for a winning strategy, perhaps involving a more serious effort by the Karzai Government to split its enemies by reaching out to moderates. US generals and other Western officials concede time and again that a military solution in Afghanistan is impossible, but they complain with some frustration that little progress is being made towards finding a political solution.</p><p>The catch, many say, is that such negotiations can succeed only if launched from a position of military dominance and that cannot be achieved while the Taliban can keep using low-cost tactics such as roadside bombs and can continue finding a safe haven, recruits and money across the border in Pakistan.</p>
