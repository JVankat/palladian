<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Commissioner Spalding introduced an initial presentation on 
development plans for the corner of 10<SUP>th</SUP> and V, which incorporates 
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">First</st1:PlaceName> 
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">African</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName 
w:st="on">New</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType 
w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> accorded landmark status through 
the efforts of the CSNA and ANC1B.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Tom Yockey, President of Broad Street Ventures, Paul Thomas from Shaw 
Pitman, and Bill Bonstra were present to give the initial presentation.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Yockey stated that they are intent 
on preserving the fa�ade of the church, but that the interior is in very bad 
shape due to the lack of a working roof for the past few years, and that the 
vines growing up the back of the building may be what are keeping it from 
falling apart.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The church plus the 
building constructed on the adjacent vacant lot and a small property to the east 
along <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street> are projected at this point to comprise a 
forty-four unit condominium building.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Mr. Yockey said that they are early in the design process and want to get 
community input as the design is refined in work with the Office of Historic 
Preservation.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Yockey stated 
that they would also be seeking some BZA variances if the project remains 
similar to current designs, and that an affordable housing component would be 
included using the additional .5 FAR and providing approximately 1200 square 
feet of affordable floor area.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Architect Bill Bonstra presented numerous elevations of the working 
designs for the project.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This will 
be a 100% residential project with one and possibly a second level of 
underground parking as site conditions allow.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The main entry will be off <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">10<SUP>th</SUP> 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street> between the church building and the new 
structure on V.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The parking will be 
accessed via the alley off <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">10<SUP>th</SUP> Street</st1:address></st1:Street>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The residential space will begin with a 
terrace level partially below grade, and there will be a total of six floors of 
residential in the new building reaching a height of sixty-five feet.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding asked about the 
height of the existing church building, and Mr. Bonstra stated that they do not 
have an exact figure yet, but the top of the spire on the church is estimated to 
be approximately sixty feet.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There 
will be four units housed in the church building, and one will be accessed 
through the original entryway.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
remaining church units will be accessed through the main entry between the 
structures.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The new structure is 
designed to not overpower the church structure, but the detailing is meant to 
reflect materials and design elements of the church while not forcing period 
replication.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Julian Pipperov from 
Bonstra Architects described the deliberate reflection of the materials and 
rhythms on the new building facing 10<SUP>th</SUP> to compliment the church and 
nearby properties.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The main entry 
uses glass along the side fa�ade of the church and allows the eye to follow the 
volume of the church.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The top floor 
of the fa�ade on 10<SUP>th</SUP> will be in lighter colored materials to 
minimize the visual impact next door to the church front fa�ade.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Yockey explained that they have 
minimized the balconies on the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">10<SUP>th</SUP> St.</st1:address></st1:Street> fa�ade, while 
emphasizing them on the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V 
St.</st1:address></st1:Street> fa�ade.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Chairperson Thomas asked if the naming of the new development will 
recognize the historic component, and Mr. Yockey said that they have not decided 
on naming the project yet, but would endorse this suggestion and search for a 
historically appropriate name.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Spalding asked if the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">10<SUP>th</SUP> <st1:place 
w:st="on">St.</st1:place></st1:address></st1:Street> fa�ade on the new building 
was flush with the fa�ade of the church, and Mr. Pipperov stated that the brick 
elements on the new building were indeed flush with the front of the church 
building.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The glass bay on the 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">10<SUP>th</SUP> 
St.</st1:address></st1:Street> fa�ade would be in public space and reflect the 
tower structure (also in public space) of the church�s front fa�ade.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding asked what BZA 
variances they would be seeking, and Mr. Thomas responded that it would probably 
residential recreation space, a rear yard variance, and there may be penthouse 
and roof element questions.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Skinner stated that he was worried that the new structure 
will overpower the historic church building, and that the developer needed to 
pay increased attention to highlighting the historic nature of the 
property.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner 
asked if there was a way to incorporate some space in the building to pay homage 
to the history represented by the landmarked building, and that the church was 
being dwarfed by the new residential building.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Yockey responded that on the north 
side of the service alley there is a fifty foot residential building currently 
being developed, and that the church would read appropriately in the context of 
the two flanking new buildings.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. 
Yockey also indicated that in many meetings with <st1:PersonName 
w:st="on">Stephen Callcott</st1:PersonName> of the Office of Historic 
Preservation, that the church structure was an infill and not a prominent corner 
property, and that the design of the new structure should maintain the original 
street rhythm.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Skinner repeated 
his request for more homage to the history embodied by the church, and Mr. 
Yockey responded that they would attempt to incorporate the suggestion as the 
designs move forward through the review process.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><st1:PersonName w:st="on">Tim 
Arnold</st1:PersonName> of CSNA asked the developer to meet with his committee, 
and said that his first impressions were disappointing.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Arnold stated that in similar 
projects where new structures were built next to historic structures, the 
connection between the two should be lower than the gabled front of the existing 
building.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The trade off might be an 
increase in the FAR on the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street> elevation to compensate the developer for 
losing space in decreasing the massing close to the church.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Arnold also asked the developer to 
explore pulling back the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">10<SUP>th</SUP> St.</st1:address></st1:Street> fa�ade of the new 
building to further enhance the church building�s massing and fa�ade.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Arnold also addressed the possible 
variance on residential recreation space, and indicated that the loss of 
recreation space in the community needed to be offset in some manner e.g. an 
ongoing relationship with <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName 
w:st="on">Harrison</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType 
w:st="on">Square</st1:PlaceType></st1:address></st1:Street> <st1:PlaceType 
w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> or other local recreation 
facilities.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot 
added that ANC1B had worked with CSNA on the preservation of the church, and had 
contributed $3,210 (corrected by Commissioner Spalding to the figure of $1,750) 
towards the land marking and hoped that the preceding comments of Commissioner 
Skinner and Mr. Arnold be put in the motion of support.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding stated that there 
would be no motion tonight, that this was simply an initial presentation of the 
possible design and request for community input.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Constituent Mark Larson who lives next 
door to the proposed project questioned the multiple uses of the alley system in 
the block.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>All of the current 
development proposals including the large Rhapsody project are proposing using 
these ten foot service alleys to access their parking facilities, and the strain 
on these alleys and noise would seriously affect the current property 
owners.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Larson also mentioned 
the tunnel of brick effect that the pairing of the <st1:place 
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Garnet</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName 
w:st="on">Patterson</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType 
w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> across the street combined with the 
sixty-five foot height of the new building and its effect on the light of 
current property owners, many of whose buildings are merely twenty-five feet in 
height.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Brian Martin Firvida, past 
President of the CSNA, stated that the new building appeared to be �stapled on 
to� the existing church building.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Mr. Martin Firvida explained that CSNA is charged with monitoring the 
historic district and that he looked forward to meeting with the developer with 
plans incorporating the dialogue that had taken place this evening, and with 
ideas generated at the CSNA Historic Preservation Committee�s reviews.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Al Hedin and Doug Yurechko from PN Hoffman stated that they 
are actively developing plans for submission in the RFP for Parcel 34.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Parcel 34 is a NCRC site between 
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Belmont</st1:City></st1:place> and 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Florida 
Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street> just to the west of <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">14<SUP>th</SUP> St.</st1:address></st1:Street> 
and it is currently vacant.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Hoffman 
is preparing a design that will include fifty residential units and fifteen 
thousand square feet of retail space.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The plans for the retail are to entice a grocery store, which in their 
initial input from community members was a preferred commercial use.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They are planning on one to one parking 
for the residential component provided on site, and also the zoning required 
parking for the retail component.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>They will be partnering with Michael Sussman who the community may know 
from his work with Clifton Terrace and <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">Florida Avenue</st1:address></st1:Street>, and the architects are 
projected to be Hickok, Warner Cole.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Mr. Hedin stated that the affordable component set out in the RFP is 20% 
in a percentage of AMI schedule set by NCRC.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner asked developer to 
consider the possibility of expanding the affordable component beyond the 
required 20%, and to develop designs that were not exclusively junior one 
bedroom, since many of the seekers of affordable units were single parents with 
children.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Yurechko responded 
that they would be fulfilling all of the zoning requirements, and that in the 
design process they will attempt to reflect the needs of possible tenants for 
the affordable units.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Our designs 
are very flexible at this point, and it would be in our best interest to design 
the units to meet the demand currently expressed in the community.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot stated that he had to 
address a matter of conflict of interest.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I sit on the Board of the Columbia Heights Development Corporation, and 
we are developing a proposal for Parcel 34.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The law in the District is that if you 
can deal with it fairly, you have to announce it and I�m announcing it, and I 
will deal with it fairly.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Spalding directed constituents to the NCRC web site to get 
much more detailed information on this parcel, and also asked if they would 
continue to work with the 14<SUP>th</SUP> and U Main Streets Initiative.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Hedin responded that they currently 
have a relationship in regard to the development on the east side of <st1:Street

w:st="on">14<SUP>th</SUP>

continue the relationship in regard to the development of Parcel 34.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><st1:PersonName w:st="on">Tim 
Arnold</st1:PersonName> asked if the proposed commercial tenant being a grocery 
store meant that they were abandoning the same possibility for the 
14<SUP>th</SUP> and V site, and Mr. Hedin stated that they have not excluded the 
possibility of a grocer in either space.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Mr. Arnold stated that the square footage was inadequate for most large 
grocers, and wondered if they are soliciting Trader Joe�s for either space, and 
Mr. Yurechko responded that they are working with Trader Joe�s as one possible 
grocer for the commercial spaces.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>They have also asked Magruder�s to visit the sites and assess their 
interest.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Yurechko also asked 
constituents to lobby neighborhood grocers who would serve their interests.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A long term constituent reminded 
everyone that there was a Safeway in the same location before the riots, and 
that the new grocer should be someone who serves the average community 
member.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding asked 
the developer to leave information for community members who wanted to contact 
them with ideas, and both agreed to leave business cards behind for any 
community members to use in contacting them.<SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal>Commissioner Spalding presented a request from Scott Pomeroy 
of the 14<SUP>th</SUP> and U Main Streets Initiative for a letter of support for 
the �Green Team�.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Pomeroy 
stated that this will be the second year for the Green Team, and that last year 
it was a demonstration project with five part time and five full time 
workers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is a partnership with 
the Coalition for the Homeless and the University of the <st1:State 
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">District of Columbia</st1:place></st1:State>, and 
they are hoping to expand the project to include thirty workers.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They will be soliciting funding from 
District agencies and foundations, and they are seeking letters of support from 
neighborhood organizations and individuals to use as support for their financial 
requests.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Of the thirteen employees 
participating in the program all started out in transitional housing, and twelve 
have now moved on to permanent housing, and all are participating in career 
training programs sponsored by UDC.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Spalding moved that a letter of support be written, and it 
was seconded and adopted unanimously (7-0-0). </P>

<P class=MsoNormal>ABRA application No. 50282 was introduced by SMD Commissioner 
Spalding.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This is a transfer of an 
existing license from the closed venture at the corner of 13<SUP>th</SUP> and W, 
and would be relocated to the commercial space next door to the Ellington 
apartments.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This is a class B 
license, and the hours would be from 10AM to 10PM.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding stated that he had 
solicited input on this transfer through the local list serve and in person, and 
had found very little concern with the relocation.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Applicant was present and described a 
beer and wine component added to their present store.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A constituent asked about the status of 
the license for the store that was at 13<SUP>th</SUP> and W, and Commissioner 
Spalding responded that once the transfer was made that any new tenant at 
13<SUP>th</SUP> and W would have to apply for a new license for the 
location.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Bryan Martin Firvida 
stated that he lives across the street from the original license location, and 
that the community had no trouble with the original location.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding added that the 
applicant has been working with the 14<SUP>th</SUP> and U Main Streets 
Initiative and is prepared to work with the Ellington�s owners Donatelli &amp; 
Klein, and he moved support of the transfer of the Class B license to 1351 U

Tabaq Bistro to be located at <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">1336 
U St.</st1:address></st1:Street> was considered.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Applicant was present and gave an 
account of his relationship to both the <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">U St.</st1:address></st1:Street> and Adams Morgan areas, as well as an 
introduction to their plans for <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">1336 U St</st1:address></st1:Street>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The family owns three restaurants 
currently one on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">U 
St.</st1:address></st1:Street> (Utopia) and two in Adams Morgan (Mezze).<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The new restaurant will be a further 
exploration of Mediterranean tapas culture.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In order to blend with the <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">U St.</st1:address></st1:Street> cultural scene 
they want to provide jazz performers, specifically targeting new young 
talents.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The building is currently 
a vacant property in the middle of the south side of the 1300 block of 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">U St.</st1:address></st1:Street>, 
and they are preparing to renovate the entire building.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The kitchen and dining areas will be on 
the first and second floors, and they will also incorporate a rooftop enclosed 
area.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding stated 
that there is concern about the fact that the roof deck will be facing an 
abutting residential area on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">Wallach Place</st1:address></st1:Street>, and that it will be very 
important to assure that noise does not affect the <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Wallach Place</st1:address></st1:Street> 
residents.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding 
also indicated that the lack of immediate parking would require that, like in 
Adams Morgan, the applicant work with other commercial tenants in organizing, 
coordinating, and perhaps even in helping develop parking for this block.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Applicant stated that he�s eager to work 
with the other businesses, and that since he and his family also live in the 
residential neighborhood nearby they would be particularly sensitive to noise 
concerns of other residents.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Spalding also noted that the hours of operation appeared to 
allow daytime use, and encouraged the applicant to develop daytime use.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Applicant stated that they have been 
successful with weekend brunch service, and are planning to serve luncheons as 
well in the new restaurant.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Guyot asked if they have had ABRA training, and applicant 
responded that all of his family members have been trained.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot stated that MPD had 
asked businesses on the corridor to participate in a rolling closing hour�s 
format and asked if applicant would participate, and applicant said that he 
would be happy to join in this effort.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Constituent Reginald Kelley asked why they are seeking a tavern license 
if there�s such an emphasis on food in their restaurants, and applicant 
responded that with the combination of food and entertainment they were more 
comfortable with the requirements of the tavern license.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Constituent Ron Renchard pointed out 
that Utopia began as a restaurant license, and once the community was 
comfortable with his operation he moved to a tavern license.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Applicant responded that for the 
business model they felt more secure in applying for the tavern license.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding moved support for 
both a stipulated license and a new tavern license for Tabaq Bistro, and it was 
seconded and adopted unanimously (8-0-0). </P>

Commissioners that we have amended our rules to allow us to consider ABRA

Democrat, but that this is where the Congressional Republicans meet.<SPAN

partisan and the political reality is that this is not a license request that we 
should take on.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Petition date is

indicated that she would like to see the applicant�s appear before the

the Commission, and if they don�t appear they won�t get my vote.<SPAN

Graham�s office stated that this was no different that the preceding debate and 
that we should support this renewal.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

the applicant before the Commission and still get a response in to ABRA.<SPAN

Commission that we voted to support an absent applicant in the previous case, 
and in this case we also have no negative sentiment raised about the applicant 
and we should treat the cases in a similar fashion.<SPAN

thought it should be the SMD Commissioner�s call, and Commissioner Guyot 
responded that there was no argument from him that the SMD should make the

and participating in the debates.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>In regard to the Coach and Four operating inside a government building or 
not will be decided by other arms of the government, and not by this ANC.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>As to the liquor license it has been 
noted that they have been operating inside the laws set by ABRA.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The issues that have been raised by my 
constituents include the traffic that�s being directed by the MPD through the 
residential streets and neighborhoods.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>This is a problem.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This is 
one of the reasons that this ANC voted to support the best practices process 
developed by the Hospitality Institute.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>These problems need to be addressed in the context of the larger 
community.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I am requesting that 
Coach and Four along with all other liquor license holders to be mindful that 
the residents are being affected by what happens after the businesses close 
down.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I expect all of them to work 
together to find workable solutions to these recurring problems.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My offer still stands that I�m willing 
to work with any and all parties concerned with these issues.<SPAN

Four, stated that they serve lunch and are open two nights.<SPAN

that they have had no violations on their liquor license, and that they are 
actively supporting the community.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>We have been working with both Campbell Heights Apartments and the MPD on 
better directing traffic.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The

w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Reeves</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType

w:st="on">U.</st1:PlaceType></st1:place><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Calvin Woodland stated that Councilmember Graham is opposed to the 
renewal, and he has sent a letter to ABRA opposing the renewal.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Woodland also described the 
opposition of the current head of the Office of Property Management who has 
written a detailed letter to ABRA protesting the renewal of this license.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Ms. Mitten�s letter indicates that the 
lease has expired, that MPD has been called seventy-five times to investigate 
criminal activity, and that the operation of a nightclub has never been 
authorized as a part of the lease agreement, and that the business currently 
owes the District more than $175,000 in back rent under the expired lease 
agreement.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson Thomas 
responded that these issues have been raised before ANC1B numerous times, and we 
can discuss these issues all night.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Guyot stated that he strongly, unequivocally and without 
caveat associate myself with the Chairperson�s position.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This is a decision for the ABC Board, 
and from the White House to the outhouse, the only body that has jurisdiction on 
this is the ABC Board.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I want to 
remind everyone that the highest award for emergency preparation was awarded to 
an agency in that building.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
other matters are so pregnant with involvement, but I�m going to stick with you 
and let�s deal with this on the merits.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Skinner stated that when he heard of the issues of violence 
associated with this license he was very concerned, and to be candid, in DC I 
look like the victim.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I took the 
time to visit this club on Thursday nights, and I found that they have a lot of 
security and that they�re taking an aggressive approach to how to manage 
activities on a large scale on a consistent basis.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I also check with ABRA and as far as 
them serving liquor there were no violations.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think we need to make sure that 3D 
does a good job.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It�s often that 
the most successful clubs get targeted for the problems.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If JoJo sees a lot of police officers 
he�s less likely to stab RayRay, but if he doesn�t see anyone out there then we 
do have issues.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It�s up to us to 
convince 3D that we need the kind of presence and enforcement that Adams Morgan 
gets.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Esters asked Mr. 
Parker to describe their security efforts, and how they react if there�s a 
shooting in a nearby alley.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. 
Parker stated that after an incident, the club increases their efforts on the 
following night.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Their security is 
already tighter than the Pentagon�s; you�re not going to get through our metal 
detectors with change in your pockets.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>People are met by police security at the entrance to the building, and 
then they are searched by our security personnel, and then they have to go 
through a metal detector, and then we have security personnel who usher them to 
the front of the restaurant, and then they�re id�d then they can enter the club 
where we also have crowd control people.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Since the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName 
w:st="on">Reeves</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType 
w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> has so many entrances and exits, we 
also have security personnel at these points, and we also have security people 
at the bathrooms.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner 
Esters asked about their relationship with MPD, and Mr. Parker stated that they 
have a good working relationship.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>We�d like to be able to employ off duty police personnel, but that�s 
restricted by DC laws.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson 
Thomas moved support for the renewal of Coach and Four�s CR license including 
the stipulation that they will continue to work with the community to address 
the problems that have been addressed in the debate, and it was seconded and

Street</st1:address></st1:Street>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>There will be thirty seats, and the reason for the tavern application is 
the perceived difficulty in maintaining the proscribed percentage of food 
sales.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They will be serving 
Ethiopian food and there will be live performances, however, there will be no 
dancing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding 
stated that he is concerned over the concentration of licenses in this block, 
but that this location was advantaged by not backing up to residential 
properties.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding 
indicated that the concentration would also affect the parking situation, and 
then referred to Commissioner Guyot�s statements that the owners in this block 
are working together to solve the parking problems.<SPAN

and managed the parking facility in the vacant lot in the middle of the 
block.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding also 
indicated that with the applied for hours of operation they could conduct a 
luncheon service, and encouraged the applicant to court more daytime use and

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><st1:PersonName w:st="on">Tim 
Arnold</st1:PersonName> from CSNA stated that their reason for seeking the

policy of CSNA to oppose licenses on an ad hoc basis.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding added that he 
agreed with the direction that this opposition had taken, that he preferred the 
ANC to write and monitor the voluntary agreements rather than the many 
neighborhood associations.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Spalding stated that he�s unaware of any existing voluntary 
agreements with ANC1B, and wanted some guidance on how we should monitor the 
terms and react to any possible complaints.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot explained that once

requested that the Commission reconsider the previous months vote on a liquor 
license for <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">1119 V 
St</st1:address></st1:Street>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. 
Nayman explained the short notice of the application prior to consideration at 
ANC1B�s July meeting, and the Commission�s refusal to honor the SMD 
Commissioner�s request for more time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Mr. Nayman stated that there are currently eighty-one signatures on 
protest petitions, and some of the neighbors have come to tonight�s meeting 
hoping to express their concerns.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Chairperson Thomas stated that we have already placed a new license 
request on the agenda, and that in order to reconsider the vote taken last month 
on 1119 V we would have to have a Commissioner who voted for the application 
request the reconsideration, and Commissioner Wright stated that he was willing 
to do so.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot stated 
that this only meant that the motion to reconsider was open to a vote.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Wright stated that he now 
understood that the community members were not given an adequate opportunity to 
voice their concerns, and he apologized to the constituents assembled to voice 
their concerns over this license application.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson Thomas returned the 
Commission to Commissioner Skinner�s new item on the agenda.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner stated that Mr. 
Fasil Asnake (applicant) had been attempting to contact him on a phone that was 
currently out of service, and apologized to the Commission for the confusion and 
the late submission.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There is an 
abandoned building at <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">2904 Georgia 
Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street>, and an experienced businessman who wants to 
transfer a Class A liquor license to this new location, and he�s seeking a 
stipulated license which requires ANC approval.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Applicant was present and explained that 
he had a business near the new convention center at <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">706 6<SUP>th</SUP> 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street>, and their building is being torn down for a 
new development.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He stated that he 
has purchased the building on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">Georgia Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street>, and hopes to run a clean and 
neighborhood friendly business.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Constituent Reginald Kelley asked if this was a store that was going to 
sell hard liquor at the corner of Georgia and Harvard, and applicant agreed that 
was his intention.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Kelley 
stated that there�s already a liquor store at Sherman and Harvard and questioned 
whether another liquor store was needed this close to an existing store.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding stated that we�ve 
not received any notification from ABRA, and asked if the location had been 
placarded.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner 
responded that they have not yet been placarded.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding noted that this 
troubles him since the intention of notification and placarding is to give 
community members a chance to assess and speak to the merits of the 
application.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding 
stated that in the case of a Class A license, it seemed imperative to give the 
community members more notification to discuss the proposed business.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner noted that he is 
also the President of the Lower Georgia Avenue Business Association, and had 
taken the applicant to meet with neighboring business owners.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This was an upscale downtown operation, 
and they�re proposing bringing that same caliber operation to <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Georgia Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This is also the case of an abandoned 
building that has been a problem for the community, and bringing in an owner 
with a responsible business is important to developing the <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Georgia Avenue</st1:address></st1:Street> 
business corridor.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner 
Guyot stated that Commissioner Skinner is treating a business like a business 
rather than criminalizing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Esters stated that this location is across the street from 
his SMD, and it is a location that has recently housed a liquor store.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What would you do if you get the 
temporary license, and then you find that you�re facing community 
opposition?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Mr. Asnake responded 
that the placarding should be up by next Tuesday, and that if faced with 
opposition from the community he would work with community groups and go door to 
door if necessary.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner 
Esters asked what would happen if they did not receive a license, and applicant 
responded that they would open a different business in the building, or if 
necessary rent the building out to another commercial tenant.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner moved support of a 
stipulated Class A license for Arena Liquor at <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">2904 Georgia Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street>, 
and it was seconded and adopted on a vote of (7-0-1). </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Commissioner Wright�s motion to reconsider the previous 
month�s vote on a new CR license for Tena Caf� located at <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on"><st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">1119 V St</st1:address></st1:Street>.</st1:address></st1:Street> was 
seconded.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot stated 
that this is the second time that ANC1B has dealt with this location, which I 
want to remind the Commission does not have a capacity of twenty people.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I want the Commission to be reminded of 
the original attack on this establishment by the same people before us 
today.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Their argument at our last 
ANC meeting was the same that was presented before.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I remember it so well.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>�We�re not attacking this place, our 
strategy is the camel�s nose under the ten�, and what they wanted to prevent at 
that time was the establishment of a building that no longer exists as a 
business.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Now they come to us and 
say �we want to attack this license�.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>At our last ANC meeting we listened to that argument, and there were 
quite a few people here who lived in that area, and one of the ladies who was 
supposed to have written a note was here and testified against them, and gave 
the same testimony as when we first considered this.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The proprietor agreed to close the back 
court, because there was a concern about noise.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Scott Pomeroy pointed out that he had 
supported this in the first application, and he made a point of saying to the 
applicant (interrupted).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We then 
proceeded to vote in a fair and open manner, and I think the motion to 
reconsider is untimely and without justification.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding spoke in favor of 
reconsideration.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>At last month�s 
meeting it was my intention to table this consideration until tonight�s meeting, 
which would have allowed us to be both considerate of the residential neighbors 
and timely in responding to the ABRA deadlines.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The intention of that motion was to give 
the community members time to discuss the application with the applicant, and 
time to find a compromise on those issues that concerned them.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I have heard that there are currently 
four petitions circulating and two organizations that plan on protesting this 
license.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I would like to suggest to 
the Commission that it would be much more effective if this Commission were to 
organize and lead the negotiations, than if there are multiple protests and 
participants in the voluntary agreement negotiating process.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I do expect that if this license is 
granted it will be the result of a voluntary agreement, and I�d rather see the 
Commission take the lead and prevent multiple parties to negotiating that could 
be a very protracted process.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Skinner asked if the applicant was present, and they were 
not.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner asked if 
they were notified to come to this meeting, and Commissioner Spalding responded 
�how can they be notified when the debate is initiated at the meeting�, and 
Commissioner Guyot added �why should they be notified�.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner asked that if 
Commissioner Spalding had this advance knowledge of the debate why hadn�t he 
notified the applicant.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Spalding indicated that he was given copies of the petitions 
at tonight�s meeting, and that there�s no way to put an issue on the agenda if 
there�s no preceding request to do so.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Fred Smith who lives on the corner of 13<SUP>th</SUP> and V Streets 
stated that the neighbors had almost no time to react to the news of the 
application prior to last month�s meeting.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The Commissioner who just left said that he�s concerned about being fair 
and open and those are the same concerns of the community members.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I don�t think that most of us are 
opposed to the license, but we�re concerned with the way that it has been 
handled. I moved here from Adams Morgan, and one of the reasons for the move to 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">U Street</st1:address></st1:Street> 
was that there�s a better mix of residential and commercial properties.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I am concerned about the creeping of 
liquor licenses off <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">U 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street> and into the residential areas like 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Let�s give everyone a chance to have a voice on this application.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Resident Reginald Kelley described his 
long association with this neighborhood and stated that there has never been a 
liquor license on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street>, and there is no need for a liquor license on 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V 
St</st1:address></st1:Street>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I 
live in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place 
w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City> condominiums and it�s a wooden framed 
building that easily conducts noise from the neighborhood.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Alcohol makes people gregarious, and 
you�re going to have noise and parking problems.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Allowing the spread of liquor licensed 
establishments into overwhelmingly residential streets like <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V Street</st1:address></st1:Street> will create 
chaos.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Another constituent stated 
that adequate review of this application in light of the changes in the 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V Street</st1:address></st1:Street> 
neighborhood was very important.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It 
is being rebuilt as a wholly residential street.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Those of us who have chosen to live in 
this neighborhood understand the nature of the commercial district on 
<st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">U Street</st1:address></st1:Street> 
and embrace it; however, this movement into the residential neighborhood is one 
that we�re all concerned with.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I 
have been in to use this business, but I don�t think this is a viable business 
plan.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I am a small business person 
myself, but I don�t think that this has been adequately presented or 
reviewed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We�re willing to come 
back and review this with the owners at any time.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Sean Steffy, <st1:Street 
w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on"><st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">1223 V St</st1:address></st1:Street>.</st1:address></st1:Street>, and 
I�ve lived here three and a half years and I�ve managed to collect twenty-eight 
signatures in opposition to the liquor license right on V Street.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We�re stating this as an opposition 
since ABRA requires that you oppose granting the license in order to gain 
standing in the process and have your concerns addressed.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A major concern is that this applicant 
wants to stay open until 2AM on weeknights and 3AM on weekends, and for a 
restaurant in the middle of a dense residential street this is a serious concern 
for us.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We�re not, as some have 
implied, out to run these people out of the neighborhood.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Last week as I was walking by the 
business I introduced myself to the owners and expressed the concerns raised by 
the neighbors, and the owners were unaware of any neighborhood concerns.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think there�s been some breakdown in 
the process of reviewing this application, and we�re here to try to get the 
process working again.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Sean Sands 
who also lives on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">V 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street> stated that with all of the neighbors gathered 
tonight shows the concern that the neighborhood has over this license.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>When we could my partner and I 
patronized the restaurant because we wanted to see it flourish as a 
business.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We�re also living in an 
area where license holders are operating in flagrant violation of the 
limitations of their licenses, and extending these licenses into the residential 
communities is a serious concern.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I�m also troubled by the vociferous support by Commissioners who do not 
represent the locality of the application, and the idea of someone who 
represents <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">LeDroit</st1:PlaceName> 
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> saying that my 
neighbors should not have a voice in what�s going into our neighborhood offends 
me.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Tom Key who also lives on V 
Street stated that he was offended when he got a copy of the transcript of last 
month�s meeting when it indicated that Commissioner Guyot stated that he didn�t 
want the neighbors to have an opportunity to come in and be heard and opposed 
the motion to table.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The purpose of 
this Commission is to listen to and speak for its constituents.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I don�t know why you wouldn�t want to 
hear from us, or why you would think that our input is so unimportant.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Please give us an opportunity to be 
heard.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I personally wouldn�t have a 
problem with this business selling beer or wine to go with a dinner, but to ask 
for hours that extend into the early morning hours two houses down from my home 
is a problem.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There are tons of 
bars all around us and I respect that, but <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">V Street</st1:address></st1:Street> is residential and I ask that you 
reconsider.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Scott Pomeroy asked to 
support the suggestion of Commissioner Spalding that the ANC be the lead 
representative in any agreement negotiated with the applicant.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I worked with the previous applicant 
through the process of negotiating the hours, and I�m speaking as someone who 
lives just a block away from <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">1119 V 
Street</st1:address></st1:Street>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I�m concerned about any place that would be open until two or three 
o�clock in the morning that completely surrounded by residents.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I hope you�ll vote to reconsider and 
I�ll save my comments on the application.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Calvin Woodland stated that he was once a Commissioner with ANC1B, and 
questioned why the request of the SMD Commissioner in whose territory this 
applicant was located is not allowed deference.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Why is there such animated interest by 
other Commissioner�s in the license in other members SMD?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If the people voted for their SMD 
Commissioner shouldn�t they expect that he would be listened to as representing 
their concerns?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot 
stated that he was glad that so much of the discussion was directed at him, 
because I�m going to say something that will shock and amaze you.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I�m not opposed to the motion to table, 
and I�m so convinced� Commissioner Spalding corrected to say that the motion was 
to reconsider, which was accepted by Commissioner Guyot.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I�m just that convinced that the people 
who are talking about reconsideration are really talking about killing that 
application, and I wait to be vindicated.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>These people came to destroy they should have the opportunity to 
destroy.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Motion to reconsider last 
month�s vote on Tena Caf�s application was adopted unanimously (8-0-0).<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot moved that this issue 
be put on the next agenda, and that the owner be notified so we can witness his 
death.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Motion was seconded.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner stated that we 
represent all of y�all.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Each 
Commissioner represents two thousand voters.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We all get on this dais to speak to 
neighborhood concerns, because going around taking a vote throughout the 
community every meeting on all these issues would be twenty-two thousand people 
being polled, so every two years you elect somebody to represent your 
issues.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We�re here to uphold 
laws.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Sometimes when individual 
Commissioners are pressured to do certain things that we as a collective looking 
at the letter of the law act as a balancing act for all of us.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It�s not trying to intrude on anybody�s 
fiefdom, because they�re not fiefdoms.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>We�re a representative body, and it may not seem effective in certain 
instances, and I think it�s less effective in some instances while in some 
instances it�s very effective.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Because sometimes its politics within a certain area that don�t allow the 
law to be studied as closely as it should be.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So, there�s a process that ABRA has with 
the contesting process, and we�ve gone through iterations to try to improve that 
so that if someone doesn�t see that their ANC didn�t do what it�s supposed to 
do, then there�s other processes that people can also have to help make sure 
that they have a say so in the process.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Any perception of flaw, there probably are flaws in the system, but all 
the people who are here have their good days and bad days and you�re here to 
help us and we�re here to help you.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>We do our best not just to represent people who show up on the night, but 
we also try to act as a body that tries to be fair.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>To hear these cutting comments�</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Chairperson Thomas stated that Commissioner Skinner�s time 
had elapsed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding 
responded that this is an application for a liquor license in my single member 
district, and Commissioner Guyot stated that Commissioner Spalding was out of 
order.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson Thomas requested 
that Commissioner Guyot allow her to run the meeting and allow Commissioners the 
right to speak.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner 
Spalding stated that this is a business that is going to be located in my single 
member district, and notably in a residential area.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was not given adequate time for my 
constituents to consider or air their concerns.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I may have concerns about the location 
of a Class A license on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Georgia 
Ave</st1:address></st1:Street>, but <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">Georgia Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street> is a commercial street.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address 
w:st="on">V Street</st1:address></st1:Street> is a residential street, and the 
people here tonight live in close proximity to this proposed business.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They�re concerned and they should be 
heard.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This has an immediate effect 
on their quality of life and they�ve come here tonight to ask us to hear their 
concerns.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Guyot stated 
that they came in force and they won.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>They wanted reconsideration and they got it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Why go to the merits of something of 
something that we�ll consider at the next ANC meeting?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My concern is this, no individual on 
this Commission, or no set of individuals on this Commission can be given great 
weight.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Great weight is applied to 
this Commission.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is the 
responsibility of us to collectively make decisions about each applicant.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I will assert my opinion in every 
application at every time until y�all turn me out of office.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Motion to reconsider at the August 
meeting was adopted on a vote of (5-1-2). </P>

stated that this is a group that is a very contributing very positive 
group.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I understand that there are 
difficulties with the request.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I�m 
asking that the Commission support the request contingent upon a submission that 
conforms with the expectations of the Treasurer.<SPAN

adopted (7-0-1).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Treasurer Esters

<P class=MsoNormal>Commissioner Skinner presented a request to the Commission to 
cosponsor Georgia Avenue Day.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We�re 
asking the Commission to participate in order to alleviate some of the fees for 
the use of Banneker Field.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Outside 
groups can be assessed fees up to $15,000, but government agencies normally get 
a break in those fees.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson 
Thomas asked what was being asked for, and Commissioner Skinner responded that 
it was actually not a grant application but sponsorship.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson Thomas asked what that 
meant, and Commissioner Skinner replied that the ANC is being asked to sponsor 
those fees that are assessed for the use of Banneker Field.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson Thomas asked why that 
couldn�t be written up as a grant application, and Commissioner Skinner replied 
that they�re asking the Commission to cosponsor it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Treasurer Esters asked how much money we 
were talking about, and Commissioner Skinner stated that Parks and Rec has not 
quoted a number yet, but if the ANC cosponsors then we definitely think it will 
be less than $15,000.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It could be 
as much as $15,000 and it could be as little as nothing.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Spalding asked whether it 
was not possible to work with someone at Parks and Rec and at least get a number 
from them?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I like the idea of the 
cosponsorship, however, without any idea of the cost I�m not sure how we can 
vote on this.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I won�t commit this 
Commission to spending a possible $15,000.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Skinner responded that for the timeliness I�m not going to 
state whether this is worth $15,000, but I think it is.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It would be prudent to have a dollar 
figure, I can take that as a friendly amendment to endorse the cosponsorship and 
then return with the dollar figure to be voted on at the next meeting.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson Thomas asked why it was 
possible to support entertainment or street festivals, which she thought was not 
allowed?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner 
stated that we can�t do anything with entertainment, but we can do something 
that�s a cultural activity, or relates to education and all those type of 
activities.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I did speak to Gottlieb 
Simon and he said it was fine.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Chairperson Thomas asked why this was not submitted as a grant 
application, and why doesn�t anything have any dollar amounts attached to 
it?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner stated 
that they�re not asking for a grant they�re asking for a cosponsorship, and the 
check would not go to the Lower Georgia Avenue Business Association but directly 
to the Dept. of Parks and Rec.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Commissioner Guyot offered an alternative motion which would entail the 
Commission agreeing to cosponsor, but we do not have to agree to the amounts 
involved until our August meeting.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Constituent Ousley recommended that if cosponsoring the event that the 
Commission might want to consider liability and insurance. Commissioner Esters 
stated that this request not only does not have a dollar value, it also has no 
description of what the costs will entail or any detail of what those costs will 
be.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I just can�t in good conscience 
vote for something when I don�t know what the money will be spent on.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Can we accomplish a resolution 
supporting this with a cosponsorship since a cosponsorship implies a financial 
liability?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This Commission is 
totally unaware of what that liability will be.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Commissioner Skinner responded that 
they�re seeking support as a sponsor, and then determining the amount at the 
next meeting.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We�re not saying, and 
I�ve been doing this six years now, that we�re committing to any dollar 
sum.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Once we�ve got the 
cosponsorship we can go to the Dept. of Rec which eliminates the use of the 
field.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Now this is an event that�s 
been held for several decades and we�re asking for a way to alleviate fees.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Back in the day you didn�t have to pay 
anything for the field.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So I�m 
trying to say that instead of using non profits only to try to use the field, 
we�re asking for our ANC, and it�s in our ANC Commission district, and he said 
he supports the activity, and what we�re asking for the Commission to act as a 
cosponsor.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A single member district 
could say �I want to be a cosponsor as a single member district�, but we�re 
asking for the Commission to be a cosponsor.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chairperson Thomas stated that she 
understood that the Commission was being asked to provide a letter of 
support.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN
