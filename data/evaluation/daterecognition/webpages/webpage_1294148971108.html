<p><a href="http://primaries.techcrunch.com"><img style="float: left" src='http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/tcp.jpg'class="shot" alt="" /></a>It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99PcP0aFNE">sadly clear</a> that our current leaders have little understanding of technology and why it&#8217;s important to our economy and culture. That has to change.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been interviewing  2008 presidential candidates for the last few months to get them to state, on record, their positions on ten key technology related issues (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/26/qa-with-senator-barack-obama-on-key-technology-issues/">Barack Obama</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/12/mccain-embarrassed-by-yahoo%E2%80%99s-actions-in-china-also-calls-google-to-the-mat/">John McCain</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/19/senator-edwards-defender-of-net-neutrality-and-open-spectrum-allocations/">John Edwards</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/01/mitt-romney/">Mitt Romney</a>, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/08/presidential-candidate-mike-gravel-does-things-a-little-differently/">Mike Gravel</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/05/kucinich-banned-by-abc-talks-to-techcrunch-sort-of/">Dennis Kucinich</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/20/who-will-be-the-first-tech-president-help-us-endorse-a-candidate/">December</a> we announced that we were also holding a <a href="http://primaries.techcrunch.com">Tech President primary</a> here at TechCrunch, where readers could vote on the candidate that they thought had the best policies on these ten key issues. The poll ended yesterday, and the results can be seen <a href="http://primaries.techcrunch.com/results">here</a>. Barack Obama won the Democrat side, with 60% of the votes (John Edwards took second). Ron Paul won the Republican vote with 73% of those votes (John McCain took second).</p>
<p>Those results are meaningful indicators of how our readers feel about the candidates. In addition, taking into account those votes as well as our own analysis, we are <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/?epi_menuItemID=8529ea2ad8631dcd3bb97904c6908a0c&#038;epi_menuID=887566059a3aedb6efaaa9e27a808a0c&#038;epi_baseMenuID=384979e8cc48c441ef0130f5c6908a0c&#038;ndmViewId=news_view&#038;newsLang=en&#038;newsId=20080129005870">endorsing one candidate from each party</a>: Barack Obama for the Democrats and John McCain for the Republicans.<br />
<big><strong><br />
Senator Barack Obama &#8211; Democrat</strong></big></p>
<p><img style="float: right" src='http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/baracks.jpg'class="shot2" alt="" />Senator Obama has put more time and effort into defining his technology policies than any other candidate. In November he released a detailed <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/14/barack-obamas-google-friendly-technology-platform/">position paper on technology issues</a>, and we had a one-on-one<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/26/qa-with-senator-barack-obama-on-key-technology-issues/"> interview</a> with him two weeks later.</p>
<p>He is staunchly in favor of net neutrality, and has promised to make it a priority to reinstate it in his first year in office. He has proposed intelligent programs for increasing technology education and access to children. He doesn&#8217;t believe the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/31/fcc-fails-to-mark-their-place-in-history/">FCC went far enough</a> in their proposed rules for opening up the 700MHz spectrum auctions. He wants to see increases in the number of H1-B visas given out each year. He strongly supports research into renewable energy sources and he has a realistic, market based approach to capping carbon emissions.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, Senator Obama talks about the future with a sense of optimism that the other candidates seem to lack. America has done great things in the past, and we can do great things in the future, so long as our leaders support our home-grown and immigrant entrepreneurs, or at least get out of the way. Jobs will be lost in some sectors, but growth in technology can drive our economy ever forward. Senator Obama seems to understand that, and has spent a great deal of time addressing technology issues and talking to Silicon Valley leaders. Some of the other Democratic candidates have staked out similar positions as Senator Obama on tech issues &#8211; but I get the sense that they are playing &#8220;me too&#8221; rather than showing real leadership and thoughtfulness on the issues.</p>
<p>Senator Obama also continues to surge when it comes to using the Internet to amplify his voice. I talked about his online surge <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/05/obama-surges-online-and-off/">earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>Senator Obama is the candidate of optimism and leadership, and he will be getting my personal vote.<br />
<big><strong><br />
Senator John McCain &#8211; Republican</strong></big></p>
<p><img style="float: right" src='http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/johnmccain.jpg'class="shot2" alt="" />Choosing Senator Obama for our Democrat endorsement was relatively easy. We had a lot more trouble with the Republicans. The trouble comes because, based on their positions on the issues, none of them are the perfect candidate. The leading candidates &#8211; Romney, Huckabee and McCain &#8211; all have flaws. And while Ron Paul won the TechCrunch primary by a very large margin, he too has flawed technology policies &#8211; not the least of which is that he is staunchly against net neutrality, and doesn&#8217;t want the FCC to get too involved with spectrum allocation rules.</p>
<p>The problems stem from Republicans&#8217; general rule to &#8220;let the market decide,&#8221; which appeals to my libertarian leanings but can cause real problems in a monopoly-type markets. People tend to have few choices when it comes to Internet or mobile providers. In those cases using government to force a level playing field and open access is what actually stimulates economic growth. Republicans also tend to shy away from &#8220;green&#8221; issues such as pollution (carbon emissions), and alternative fuel research. Finally, their reluctance to get the Federal government involved directly in education means that they avoid issues like increasing math and science curriculums in public schools, or providing Federal funding or incentives to address the digital divide (in particular, getting computers and Internet into schools). Their resulting policies tend to put off technology focused voters.</p>
<p>Taking all of the Republican candidates positions into consideration, as well as TechCrunch reader voting, we are endorsing Senator McCain as the best candidate from that side of the aisle. Senator McCain, more so than any other Republican candidate, is at least willing to go on record on any issue we brought up in our <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/12/mccain-embarrassed-by-yahoo%E2%80%99s-actions-in-china-also-calls-google-to-the-mat/">interview</a> with him.</p>
<p>He is standoffish on net neutrality, mobile spectrum rules and the digital divide. And he has <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/presidential/issue.php?issue=10">voted against </a>some bills to fund renewable energy research.</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s made it clear that he&#8217;ll address inequities that arise from his hands-off policies on net neutrality and mobile allocations, which other Republican candidates refuse to do. And his <a href="http://primaries.techcrunch.com/">positions</a> on Internet Taxes, H1-B visas, China/human rights violations and other issues are strongly pro-technology. Romney and, to a lesser extent Huckabee, by contrast, have shown little inclination to even discuss their position on these issues.</p>
<p>Senator McCain also has more pure leadership experience than any other candidate running for office. He is the elder statesman of the election, and that experience counts for something. Finally, his pro-business leanings will do much to promote the technology economy in the U.S.</p>
<p>Now, as an aside, McCain did say that he was &#8220;illiterate&#8221; when it comes to computers, which isn&#8217;t uncommon for his generation. His campaign has clarified that position somewhat since then, and it&#8217;s clear that McCain has surrounded himself with enough technically savvy individuals that he&#8217;s likely to avoid a &#8220;series of tubes&#8221; type comment down the road. Frankly, I don&#8217;t give a damn if McCain ever turns on a computer or not. I just want a president who has the right top-down polices to support the information economy or, as I said above, be smart enough to just get out of our way and let us do our thing.</p>

<p>My point wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t want to know YOUR opinion. I&#8217;d welcome that as well! But the voting page clearly said that it was based on the votes and &#8220;input from our community of technology leaders and entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless that just means you deciding, then it&#8217;s quite misleading.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also note that the reason you got all the media coverage for this seems to be the idea of letting your readers vote. I don&#8217;t have a problem with you endorsing who you want to, on your own private website, but you should have at least told people that was how it was going to work.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think that Paul&#8217;s policies on those issues would be bad, but you (and others) do. That wasn&#8217;t (and isn&#8217;t) my point. My point is that the voting page suggested that it was the votes that were important.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re saying is that because no one plans on voting for him, and because YOU don&#8217;t like some of his policies, he didn&#8217;t win the endorsement. That would be fine if you had advertised it as a personal endoresment and hadn&#8217;t bothered with all the voting.</p>
<p>You can argue that you never said that it would be the votes alone that would decide the result, but thats not the line you used when trying to get coverage of the event in the media:</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4023566&#038;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4023566&#038;page=1</a></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;giving its opinionated readership a voice on policy issues close to tech-savvy Americans&#8217; hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting today, TechCrunch, &#8230; , will allow readers to vote on its site for a Republican and a Democratic presidential candidate&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea for reader-endorsed candidates began after users responded strongly to the site&#8217;s podcasts with candidates this fall&#8221;</p>
<p>you even said you&#8217;d be checking for bots to make sure the vote was accurate.</p>
<p>Looking more at the CNET link&#8230;</p>
<p>Candidate:   Internet Friendly Votes (%):</p>
<p>McCain &#8211; 31.25%<br />
Paul &#8211; 80.00%<br />
Huckabee, Romney, Giuliani &#8211; N/A (As not in Senate or Congress during this time)<br />

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-682569" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>peteremcc &#8211; the polling definitely came into consideration in choosing McCain over Romney, huckabee or paul. You’ve got to rememeber that even though Paul is a force online, no one is really planning on voting for him. And some of his policies on net neutrality and 700 mghz, and education, are just not good for the country.</p>
<p>Sir, with all due respect, you could not be more wrong.  Plenty of people have already voted for Ron Paul.  Despite a near total media blackout, he currently stands in 4th place in total votes for republicans.</p>
<p>I personally know about 500 friends, family and acquaintances who plan to vote for Ron Paul in their upcoming primaries, and I convert at least one new person to the freedom train every day.</p>
<p>Apparently, you think the nanny state is a good thing and that everything needs direction and control from the federal government.  Ron Paul wants We the People to have freedom.  He trusts us and thinks we&#8217;re intelligent enough to run our own lives without the nanny state.  In essence, you are saying that you don&#8217;t think we have sense enough to manage our lives, our pocketbooks, ourselves, the internet or how our children are educated without Big Brother intervening.</p>
<p>In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, our economy is tanking.  Maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter to you, maybe you&#8217;re extremely wealthy and insulated from the inflation most of us middle class type folks have been feeling for a long time.    Maybe you don&#8217;t care about the fact that, according to David Walker of the GAO, we currently have a $50+ trillion unfunded debt for entitlement programs covering social security, medicare and so on.  Ron Paul has REAL answers to fix those problems: cut spending overseas and take care of things at home.  He believes in America and Americans FIRST.  Check out his impeccable voting record; he&#8217;s been saying this for many, many years.</p>
<p>Contrast that with McCain&#8217;s: amnesty, no tax breaks, more spending war, war, war.  How are we going to pay for all that?  Who is going to fight those wars? (hint: Ron Paul has received more donations from the military than any other candidate, Obama is second).  I sure hope you&#8217;re not 42 or under or you&#8217;ll be eligible for the draft.  Legislation is already on the table.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re certainly free to endorse whomever you please but sincerely don&#8217;t hope I have to say, &#8220;I told you so&#8221; in the next couple of years.</p>

This sentence contains a few misunderstandings. First, &#8220;let the market decide&#8221; is no longer a Republican rule, but that of Ron Paul. He stands against the statism that pervades both parties, and evidently TechCrunch too.  Second, the &#8220;real problems&#8221; you see in &#8220;monopoly type markets&#8221; displays a) a deep, but understandable, ignorance of economics, and b) a position on net neutrality that I find very wrong. The internet is the one great hope for the future freedom of humanity. Any and all governmental interference can only serve the interests of the government, and not those of the people. Shame on you!</p>

seriously, if you are not going to consider what 73% of your readers think at least provide some decent argument that supports your position.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, you pointed out that Ron Paul has flawed technology policies &#8211; not the least of which is that he is staunchly against net neutrality, and doesn’t want the FCC to get too involved with spectrum allocation rules.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you quite read/understood his positions. He is against Government regulation of the inrnet becuase he believees that No government should have the power to decide what you should read or not read, see and not see, he wantes the internet free.</p>
<p><span style='text-align:center; display: block;'><object width='640' height='390'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/ogx-16xpzAg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' /><param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /><embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/ogx-16xpzAg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' width='640' height='390' wmode='opaque'></embed></object></span></p>
<p>In 2006, a &#8220;Technology voter guide&#8221; by CNET awarded Paul a score of 80%, the highest score out of both houses of Congress. He believes the internet should be free from government regulation and taxation and opposes internet gambling restrictions and net neutrality.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s that a bad technology policy?</p>

Since when does ignoring an insignificant blogger&#8217;s silly questions make you worse off than a man that &#8220;is standoffish on net neutrality, mobile spectrum rules and the digital divide. And he has voted against some bills to fund renewable energy research&#8221;. I&#8217;d rather take my chances with someone who hasn&#8217;t talked to you about the issues yet than take someone like that who is also so prowar that we&#8217;ll all be fighting and mourning too much to care about his stance on tech issues.</p>

Also, you site &#8220;real problems in a monopoly-type markets&#8221; as it relates to &#8220;Internet or mobile providers&#8221; as the foundation of your decision not to endorse Ron Paul. It is very clear by reading Ron Paul&#8217;s literature on the subject that his philosopihies on &#8220;free markets&#8221; as they pertain to the internet concern CONTENT and really have nothing to do with &#8220;Internet or mobile providers&#8221;. When barriers to entry such as government regulations are cleared to allow for pure competition in an industry like the Internet, anyone even basically educated in business can tell you that when market segments make money, they will draw in competition. Congressman Paul&#8217;s record on technology and the Internet are clear and his comittment and consistency in this regard are laudable.</p>
<p>You have lost one subscriber by this poor choice and I hope the free-market teaches you just how unforgiving it can be when a product no longer serves to provide quality.</p>

I was even excited when I saw that you were interviewing presidential candidates. But it&#8217;s clear from this disaster that you are a just too heavy handed to be in a position to speak for the technology community in any way.</p>
<p>Your writing implies that your positions on these issues are in some way what TC readers think or worse yet&#8212; what the tech community as a whole thinks. Youso obviously -know- what is &#8216;just not good for the country&#8217;.</p>
<p>I get that the poll isn&#8217;t scientific and the ronbots inflated the numbers. But, the ignoring of the polling just exacerbates the already present sense that you just personally picked your favorites and misused your own readers. The only reason the candidates gave you the time of day was do to your readers&#8230; yet your sentiment is arbitrary, dismissive and arrogant toward the idea that many of your readers may not agree with you on many issues.</p>
<p>I hope that this episode demonstrates to you the difference between amusingly arbitrary opinions on tech startups and the representation of your readers in politics. It&#8217;s a very different scenario and your first approach at it isn&#8217;t sitting too well with many of your readers. I hope it&#8217;s a learning experience and next time you&#8217;ll take a less heavy handed approach.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t know if you read my comment in the original request, but that pretty much explains my position re both candidates. Except of course that back then I was positive about Ron Paul, because I thought he might be less loony than his supporters. Since then we&#8217;ve learnt that he&#8217;s either a foaming racist, or allows foaming racists to write articles under his byline.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to break this to the majority of posters who&#8217;ve been bussed into this thread, but Ron Paul is a tit. His supporters are less than tits. Areolae, you could say. He&#8217;s the candidate of those cats who fall down stairs in YouTube videos. If United States democracy worked along the same lines as Digg and had &#8216;power users&#8217; or &#8216;super users&#8217; or whatever, he&#8217;d probably win, but thank God, it doesn&#8217;t and he won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>67&#8242;s comment that if you&#8217;re a libertarian, you must support Ron Paul is extremely revealing. No true libertarian would ever write a sentence that contained the words &#8216;you must&#8217; or &#8216;you should&#8217;. Ron Paul&#8217;s fanbase isn&#8217;t libertarian, it&#8217;s cultish. It&#8217;s &#8220;We are we, and if you are not we in every single respect, you are they, and they are damned&#8221;. Binary thought at its best &#8211; the perfect match to the 1s and 0s of the Internet, and completely adrift from the real, 3-dimensional universe.</p>

Most companies is against Internet tax is Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Dell, Oracle, Facebook, Yahoo, ASK, cisco, intel, Myspace, Youtube, Sony, and all internet companies.</p>
<p>Most of people will not go online or purchase anything on triple taxation. Kids will not go online for wikipedia or do book report.  Christmas sales won&#8217;t be good either. It will hurt 90% startups and airline tickets, movie ticket sales.</p>
<p>Release this internet tax is like triggering perl harbor&#8217;s surprise attack. In addition, internet tax can always be political crime &amp; defraud companies millions dollars.</p>

<p>But then again, this is online media. Your readers are the people who live online. Ron Paul has the biggest support amongst the online crowd so no wonder he&#8217;s coming in first in an online poll.</p>
<p>I mean, what you are saying is basically that the voting results in Florida, New Hampshire or any other state are not valid because they do not take into consideration the views of the people in, say, Montana.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, you&#8217;re free to say whatever you like on your blog, but then do not pretend to be asking your readers for their opinion on the matter only to reject them if they don&#8217;t match your own personal views.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the actual political issues themselves: You&#8217;re basically saying that more taxes, more regulation and more government are beneficial to technological and economic development and that &#8216;too much&#8217; freedom on the other hand is detrimental?<br />
What about privacy issues and civil liberties? Don&#8217;t you think these are of great importance to the tech crowd, too? Creativity and progress require freedom of thought.</p>

<p>Until Ron Paul turned out to be against it, Net Neutrality was a big tech issue that just about everyone on the various tech sites liked and promoted.  Suddenly it&#8217;s a bad thing?</p>

<p>Being in a family of teachers (wife, mother and father) you would be blown away at the unbelievably silly, ridiculous, and pathetic policies and politics that rule public schools here in the US.</p>
<p>Just this year, my wife has 7 kids that can hardly speak English in her class (she cannot speak Spanish and she can&#8217;t communicate with the parents becasue they don speak English..would these children not be better served with a teacher that can properly communicate with them!) on top of that she has a student that very clearly should be in a special education class but he is not because the school administration says &#8230;I kid you not&#8230;he is too low for special ed!!</p>
<p>This is a normal 2nd grade class room&#8230;in the 5th grade there was a 15 year old who was bumped to 9th grade after the Christmas break.</p>
<p>Sadly this is the norm&#8230;every year it&#8217;s a new group of children and a more unbelievable set of circumstances&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how teachers do it but I greatly respect them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one&#8217;s planning on voting for him&#8221;- Except myself and almost everyone I talk to, including all of the people who&#8217;d never heard of him because the mainstream media tries to ignore him hoping he&#8217;ll go away.  Considering his policy stances are researched and represent the people, not the government, that should tell you something.  Paul is against Net Neutrality because he believes it is not within the government&#8217;s power to say ANYTHING regarding free speech on the internet.  The protection of personal rights is safeguarded by property rights and libel laws.  If an actual crime is committed, agents of the law can follow up on that but to even allow government to make regulations at will regarding the internet is to ask for FCC-like monopoly making.</p>
<p>The internet has, save for its original government support, been an exercise in free-market economics.  It&#8217;s proven that the vast exchange of unencumbered information leads to unrestrained creativity and also great wealth for those who have workable ideas.  In other words, it&#8217;s been everything that would have been in the United States in general if not for government interference.</p>
<p>Allowing the government to step in and do to the internet what they do to bandwidth and disaster relief, not to mention taxation and openly spying, is absurd and Unconstitutional.  Only Ron Paul will stand up for your rights on these and other issues.  How you can even think of a technophobe who doesn&#8217;t even understand economics, let alone  the internet like McCain is insane.</p>

<p>1. Everyday we get the weather report and every day they give you the record high and the record low for that day.</p>
<p>Now if the planet is about to explode into a ball of flames from global warming then why are we non consistently having new record highs on a weekly basis?  Seriously, start watching your local weather reports more closely&#8230;</p>

<p>3.  We&#8217;ve only have really good records of weather for the past 60-70 years (if that long) so how can we say any climate change is not a result of weather cycles that are longer than our records can back up?</p>

<p>Ron Paulites have become infamous with spamming polls &#8211; admittedly I have no evidence of it being the case here.  It was a light qwip at the end not a serious accusation that the poll was biased.  I think Ron Paul should have won based on the votes cast and a follow up post from Micheal could have put accross his/techcrunches view after (if at all seeing as this is a tech blog not a politics blog and this just seems to alientate readers for no real reason.)</p>

So any &#8220;Net Neutrality&#8221; bill that comes out of congress will be as orwellian as NAFTA or &#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221;. It will serve big companies like comcast and verizon and they will fight with the other big companies&#8230; and our rights will be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Go read HR1955. THAT is the future of net neutrality. There will be no real net neutrality. Even Obama would see to that. They might call it net neutrality, but it will be something as orwellian as the Patriot Act. How can you not understand this? How is not totally transparent to you? You need to learn how your government works! After all that&#8217;s happened in the last 12 years, this is as predictable as the sun rising.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal for all the big corporations like at&amp;t and verizon is to eliminate the ability for free thinking people to share ideas&#8230;. ideas which lead to the candidacy of people like Ron Paul. Big media will unite against that, because they know that Ron Paul wants to take away their pie. It doesnt take a genius to realize that when you start abridging people&#8217;s rights to have free flow and exchange of ideas, it becomes a serious impediment to technological progress (and eventually, to progress of any kind). Yet that&#8217;s what big media&#8217;s lobbying arm is slowing releasing on us, with legislation such as HR1955.</p>
<p>Freedom is what makes technology boom. That&#8217;s why so many tech savvy people do support ron paul.</p>

What if TechCrunch had to comply with a Washington law stating that all your readers must have equal weight in determining the content TechCrunch publishes?</p>
<p>What if the lawyer you had to hire to comply with this new &#8220;User Gen Neutrality&#8221; law determined that it meant that if you have a poll: you must use the results of that poll as the official results of TechCrunch &#8211; and to deny them their voice would be grounds for financial penalties.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s ridiculous. As the reactions here show &#8211; plenty of readers are voting with there eyeballs and have decided not to return &#8211; giving TechCrunch financial incentives &#8211; if warranted &#8211; to improve how it engages readers in the future&#8230;</p>
<p>You say: &#8220;People tend to have few choices when it comes to Internet or mobile providers. In those cases using government to force a level playing field and open access is what actually stimulates economic growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does anyone really belive this? Why not use good journalism and state some facts? How many isp&#8217;s are there in the us? I don&#8217;t know &#8211; but I know I have plenty of choices. Thousands? Tens of thousands?<br />

<p>And you think there will be more or less ISPs if we allow lawmakers in D.C. &#8211; not tech innovators or customers &#8211; telling them how to run their networks?</p>
<p>Re: mobile market: Did Apple need government regulation to introduce the iPhone and shake up the market? Did Google with its Android? There are WiFi networks being built by innovative companies. There are companies like Skype and Netgear selling wifi mobile phones for this slow &#8211; but growing network. Are we to trust DC to determine what the mobile network will look like 10 years from now?</p>
<p>When has more regulation by special-interest-tied politicians helped rather than hindered, artificially favoring one area of industry over others?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no Ron Paul fanboy. I can just use some common sense.  (Go Rudy! &#8211; A guy who turned around NYC&#8217;s economy by Reducing regulation and taxes on small businesses.)</p>

Sorry, but if the government didn&#8217;t charge billions of dollars to license the airwaves and then have us pay taxes to help the government censor speech on the radio and TV then there wouldn&#8217;t be a reason for the FCC.  Paul goes to the source of every problem and doesn&#8217;t dance around it like every other candidate.  The whole point Dr. Paul makes is that you don&#8217;t need government organizations to oversee everything.  For example, the spectrum auction unfortunately creates a $5B fee, in addition to the general startup costs of actually building a network, to license the spectrum and start a business.  Who knows how many smaller companies could start offering services if it weren&#8217;t for a government tax $5B (starting at). And who do you think puts all those taxes on your mobile phone bill?<br />
If the government gets involved with the internet via Net Neutrality we will only end up with a bigger bill just like our mobile phone bills.</p>

I watched the google interview and realized that for the first time in my life I was looking at a candidate that was worth voting for.  I have now voted for him in two separate straw polls and actually donated to his campaign several times. I most certainly plan to vote for him, but I can&#8217;t really say that I plan to read your blog any more.</p>

Yes, it is absolutely important to limit government interference in private business&#8230; except in case of monopolies.  Net Neutrality represents one of these necessary exceptions, without them the monopolistic carriers will completely stifle any kind of innovation that they can&#8217;t profit from.  These same carriers have already been colluding with each other and abusing their monopolies to keep our broadband reach artificially low all in efforts to pad their bottom lines, all while the infrastructure of every other first-world country has surpassed us by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to break up these monopolies and protect the people!  Ron Paul is actually supporting these megacorporations.  His would-be policies are dangerous and you Ronbots are lapping it all up.  Yes, I get you are disgusted with the current status quo&#8230; we all are.  But PLEASE get informed about who you are supporting and the slippery slope that this faulted man will lead you!</p>

<p>What about the corporations that only serve the interests of the their shareholders, and not those of the people? Are there currently ANY mobile providers in the US that are serving the interest of the people?</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-682850" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mad Hatter: I&#8217;m no Ron Paul fanboy. But in response to your:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just whining about government interference doesn’t do much good if you don’t have a cogent plan for pulling the government out of human affairs, or if you don’t have a plan for getting the legislative branch to adopt this withdrawal.&#8221;</p>
<p>I offer this: &#8220;Pulling Government Out of Human Affairs 101&#8243;</p>
<p>+ 1) Vote for a politician who wants the economy to grow by Reducing burdens on the economy: by reducing taxes, by reducing competition-stifling regulations, by being protectionist regarding trade affairs. Look for politicians who know that innovative individuals and small businesses greatly help drive this economy when they can remain innovative.</p>
<p>+ 2) How do you know who will do this and who won&#8217;t? Listen to candidates. All Democrats want to raise taxes and introduce laws that shift more power to the central government to regulate more of how the market should function. McCain and Huckabee even talk and have practiced (including Romney&#8217;s Mass. healthcare law) some of this &#8211; which is one reason why Republicans are so upset by their choices.</p>
<p>+ 3) But really: &#8220;if you don’t have a cogent plan for pulling the government out of human affairs&#8221; I have a very simple and cogent plan for pulling government out of human affairs and stifling innovation and growth: it&#8217;s called &#8220;Vote Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know the tech set are predominantly left-leaning. Yet imagine the internet was ruled as many Democrats want to run other industries like the health industry, auto industry, the energy industries&#8230; Talk about regulation stifling growth&#8230; yikes&#8230;</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-682859" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;Am I the only Paul supporter who isn’t grinding my teeth because the editors of a blog editorialized? They can pick who they want, and they explained that they still took into account the voting . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree and no, you are not alone in this.  I have libertarian leanings, I am a Paul supporter, and though I&#8217;d love the sort of regulation that Japan has seen spur forward momentum in bandwidth availability, I still think the market can respond to such a need without governmental regulation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep reading TC (as I always have), as I don&#8217;t tune out media just because of these constant reminders of the need for critical analysis.  Of course, regardless of what the TC polls show and who Arrington ended up endorsing in the name of TC, there are a few interesting contradictions for Arrington to own up to:</p>
<p>1) &#8220;We are certainly not discounting the reader polling; on the contrary I’m highlighting it. But I get to have an opinion, too…so we’re publishing both our poll results as well as my own opinion.&#8221;  The concern among readers seems to be less about you publishing both  your opinion and the the poll results and more about the fact that your opinion significantly trumped the poll results in leading to an &#8216;endorsement&#8217;.  Perhaps if you had offered a dual endorsement for Paul and McCain there could have been a more honest dialog in the preceding comments?  Further, you talk about &#8216;we&#8217; when backing up the decision and &#8216;I/my&#8217; when referring to the opinion itself.  Decide whether TC is an editor, a staff, or a community and remain consistent.</p>
<p>2) &#8220;The problems stem from Republicans’ general rule to “let the market decide,” which appeals to my libertarian leanings but can cause real problems in a monopoly-type markets. . . . In those cases using government to force a level playing field and open access is what actually stimulates economic growth.&#8221;  First, monopoly-type markets often occur as a result of selective governmental regulation and strategic partnerships when developing publicly-supported infrastructures.  Second, the government acts as a monopoly in itself when it decides what is best for the market.  Third, if a Senator or a citizen knows what is best for a market or economy, they could best demonstrate their wherewithal by starting a highly successful company.  For more on monopolies, please read: <a href="http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/microsoft_monopoly.html" rel="nofollow">http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/microsoft_monopoly.html</a></p>
<p>3) Contrast the statement on &#8216;monopoly-style markets&#8217; with the conclusion, &#8220;I just want a president who has the right top-down polices to support the information economy or, as I said above, <b>be smart enough to just get out of our way and let us do our thing.</b>&#8221;</p>
<p>4) Your article rests largely on the premise of net neutrality as an indisputable boundary line of tech politics, though it is clearly not.</p>
<p>Other than that, thanks for creating yet another forum for thoughtful discourse on the matters that affect us most.</p>

<p>Many tech savvy people use lolspeak and make All Your Base jokes. Is it because lolspeak and All Your Base have an inherent comedic quality that only tech savvy people can see? No, it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re part of a culture  of which those memes are part &#8211; call that culture geekdom, nerddom, tech savviness, whatever you want. When you make or laugh at a lolspeak joke, it&#8217;s because you &#8216;get&#8217; something that others don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Ron Paul is just another Internet meme. Supporting him is a way of simultaneously belonging and excluding. He&#8217;s not the only libertarian in America and he&#8217;s certainly not the most attractive or consistent. So why him? Doesn&#8217;t matter. Why All Your Base?</p>
<p>The fact that Ron Paul is a meme and not a candidate also explains why all the money and exposure in the world won&#8217;t get him mainstream support. He&#8217;ll never break out of the group, without the group he is nothing. If everyone said &#8220;I can has cheeseburger&#8221; instead of &#8220;Could I have a cheeseburger&#8221;, it would cease to be funny. If Ron Paul was regarded as a serious candidate, he would lose all appeal.</p>

<p>A litle reasearch may help inform:</p>
<p>A 2 second Google search: &#8220;http://www.isp-planet.com/research/rankings/usa.html&#8221;<br />
Shows At&amp;t with a monopolistic? 18% of the isp market? It takes the top 4 competitors to (not even) equal 50% of the market share?  When are 4 separate competitors considered a single monopoly? (And remember there are Thousandsof isps out there.)</p>
<p>Mike: &#8220;and abusing their monopolies to keep our broadband reach artificially low all in efforts to pad their bottom lines&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how tying themselves to the $10/mo dial up modem isp service that has devastated AOL &#8211; would be less desirable than the $50/mo high speed access that Every isp wants to offer by the millions. So much so that Verizon has done what its competitors consider the unthinkable and spent billions bringing fiber optic lines directly to homes (the last mile) with their FiOS service.</p>
<p>Long live competition.</p>
<p>And re: regulating the mobile market. Ask yourself this: do you want cell phones that cost 3 or 4 times as much as they do now? Do want what various European nations do and regulate which mobile service providers phone manufacturers can partner with? Do we want an iPhone that costs 2x or more than it does now here &#8212; as European laws have forced Apple to do in Europe.</p>
<p>Yes, forced. They said, Apple you may not enter in exclusive deals with mobile service providers, which help reduce costs on the phone &#8211; as Apple can partake in negotiating for some of the profit from the service subscriptions as they currently do in the US with At&amp;t.</p>
<p>Americans are smart and innovative and know what works.</p>

<p>You fail at understanding, Bar. :) Try again later when you actually understand what&#8217;s going on. RP has wide appeal on the internet from random people. Simultaneously his biggest strength and weakness is that he doesn&#8217;t know how to organize or control the massive number of people who like him. He may have hit a maximum number of supporters (i.e. maybe it&#8217;s not growing like it was), but those supporters are very real.</p>
<p>Reading the above posts, I don&#8217;t see much fanatacism&#8211; just a lot of people voicing their opinions in a blog&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p>I find it scary that others don&#8217;t recognize they&#8217;d be asking the same question if Romney won the popular TC vote by a landslide but somehow McCain got the endorsement.</p>

Case in point is Ted Stevens remark about the internet tubes.

<p>Wait, let me understand your logic. Obama wants more control of the Isp&#8217;s not from any individual or company that wants to offer that service &#8211; but would rather write a law defining the terms of service? What&#8217;s &#8220;writing a law that determines the terms of service?&#8221; It&#8217;s politicians in DC &#8211; as influenced by special-interest lobbyists (which is now including the beloved Google?) to enhance their interests.</p>
<p>How is centralizing the rules in Congress rather than letting any company or person with a dell server Decentralizing?</p>
<p>Decentralizing, by definition, means not concentrating power for these decisions in DC and letting the market chase what customers want. Decentralizing means letting Customers decide the merits of the services they purchase &#8211; and not DC.</p>

<p>Secondly, the net-neutrality issue has been clearly addressed above, the renewables issue hasn&#8217;t yet.  I&#8217;ve been promoting solar thermal systems for 22 years and have literally fought the US government on all sides.  They recognized it&#8217;s potential in the 80&#8242;s and allowed big energy companies to help them decide to delay it&#8217;s pursuit.  Then when Spain got the same idea, they even bought into their development program to &#8216;help&#8217; them with all their gained experience.  The result?  &#8230;Spain&#8217;s 2002 project got delayed for an extra few years.  Meanwhile, us small-timers couldn&#8217;t fight the regs to qualify for a single grant anywhere in the country.  The non-profits and &#8216;paid research organizations (universities)&#8217; couldn&#8217;t assist us because they were required to look to &#8216;energy experts&#8217; on whether something was viable or not.  Those &#8216;experts&#8217; were specified to come from the big energy companies so again we lost out.  Long story short is that after 2 decades of this game some of us are getting the ducks lined up all on our own and this stuff is hitting the market.  If the government had gotten out of the way and not &#8216;promoted&#8217; the joke of a solution in solar PV and wind (let alone the nuclear and fossil fuels), we wouldn&#8217;t be in the energy crisis we&#8217;re in now.  So don&#8217;t even try to tell me that government &#8216;support&#8217; or &#8216;assistance&#8217; or &#8216;aid&#8217; is better than market driven solutions.  All the government ever does is sell out it&#8217;s support to the highest bidder and create state managed monopolies!  You, sir, could not be less informed.</p>
<p>This awareness of how the real world works is the main un-reported driving force behind the internet geeks.  For clarification, that means tech-savvy professionals capable of researching cause and effect of each issue to it&#8217;s final conclusion.  Unfortunately, it takes more than sound bites to learn this.  This is why the revolution is going slow but also why it doesn&#8217;t backtrack either.  Why else do you see &#8220;Google Ron Paul&#8221; or &#8220;Research On Your Own&#8221; all over the place?  They&#8217;re telling you it takes more than &#8220;Friends, &#8230;&#8221; to see what&#8217;s behind the curtain.</p>

He challenges traditional politics, but how can someone honestly think that he is going to unify either the House or Senate on ANY issue?  We do not have a dictatorship in this country, so we need a president who can actually get something accomplished by working with Congress.  Can we really revamp how we budget money and implement &#8220;Austrian style economics&#8221; in eight years?  Are we going to focus on goals that are pipe dreams or are we going to work together to make the country better?</p>
<p>There are nations that do not believe the government should meddle in the economy or social programs a la Ron Paul.  They are typically THIRD WORLD NATIONS.  Most U.S. federal tax dollars go to defense spending, so cutting federal tax dollars towards education, health care, and infrastructure is not only dangerous, it doesn&#8217;t solve our budget problems.</p>
<p>BTW, TechCrunch guys, please let the people know at the Obama camp to make it easier to embed and email Obama&#8217;s speeches directly from the Obama home page.  You can get them from YouTube, but it can&#8217;t hurt them to make it directly accessible from the site.  I asked them once already.</p>

What you&#8217;re seeing is a genuine organic, grassroots phenomenon.  Many people of diverse backgrounds have come across Ron Paul&#8217;s message and have gotten excited about it.  There is no command center directing people to &#8220;attack&#8221; this site or that one.</p>
<p>That said, the only thing that really matters is the content of Ron Paul&#8217;s message.  Examine what he says for yourself &#8211; either you will think it makes sense or it doesn&#8217;t.  Trying to discredit him as a candidate because of your perceptions of some of his supporters doesn&#8217;t seem like a very thoughtful way to evaluate a candidate.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Also, we all knew who the popular Republican would be, and I would have learned nothing from Arrington rehashing Paul&#8217;s position.  As a non-republican, I&#8217;m hoping Paul&#8217;s nominated, and if he is, I&#8217;ll vote for him.  But if he ISN&#8217;T I don&#8217;t want to be left in the dark as to the other candidates on that side of the aisle.  In addition, Arrington&#8217;s right about Paul&#8217;s position on net neutrality.  That&#8217;s a tough one for me, being both a lover of the freedom the internet offers, and being a fairly libertarian businessman.</p>
<p>In any case, I find this all very encouraging.  I can identify with both the popular vote here and the official endorsements.  That gives me hope in the full event this November.</p>

<p>Why take power from Jane and Joe Apartment and Small Company, LLC and even Big Company, Inc and hand it to business and economy-numb, Professional-Politician Smith &#8212; who most likely is also supported with lobby dollars by one of any arguing two sides in an industry argument such as this &#8211; ie, either a Google, Yahoo or Microsofts Or the opposing At&amp;t, Verizon, Commcasts&#8230;</p>

If you&#8217;ve paid any attention to these third-world countries to which you refer, they are INVARIABLY the opposite of Austrian economics.  Their economies are highly controlled, typically by dictators, and their people have very little economic freedom.  America became the dominant economic power in the world PRECISELY because of our unprecedented economic freedom, something which, sadly, has been diminishing steadily over the past century.</p>
<p>But, you are correct that a Ron Paul presidency would be severely limited by an uncooperative Congress.  So is that justification to pursue goals that are wrong-headed just to get Congress&#8217; cooperation?  I would much rather have a president who understands what is needed and would do whatever he can toward those ends regardless of how much he may be stymied by members of Congress and their special interests.</p>

<p>It is not Dr. Paul&#8217;s understanding of technology that is flawed, Mr. Arrington, but your understanding of markets.</p>
<p>The problem comes in monopolies?  Please, then, name for me one monopoly that could exist without government intervention in the markets preventing the individual actors in said markets from reallocating their scarce resources to more cost or service effective providers.</p>
<p>I cannot purchase internet service from any provider but Comcast in my local area because my local government chose to be protective.  Unfortunately, their choice was to be protective of the cable company monopolies.  They forced &#8220;competition&#8221; into Indianapolis by divying up the city into micro-monopolies.  Now, several companies have protected territory thanks to government racketeering.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the golden calf of net neutrality is certainly appealing on the surface, but its enactment will only serve to stifle innovation and competition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to continue but lunch is over and I must get back to productive participation in the economy.</p>

I changed my voter registration to Republican just so I could vote for him and I did vote for him.  I don&#8217;t agree with everything he says he wants to do, but the majority of it I do agree with.  I did a lot of research before deciding who to back, and Ron Paul is definitely the one that I think would do the best job for the country as a whole.  His ideas for technology issues don&#8217;t matter all that much because we are still supposedly in a democracy and all of us who are passionate about net neutrality and such can write our congresspeople with our views if it were to ever come up.</p>

What is not being addressed is that Mr. Arrington&#8217;s little poll here get publicized with the label of &#8216;the techie&#8217;s poll&#8217; and that is a misrepresentation.  For one reason or another, many people have do not read past the headline.  They will come away thinking that McCain has the support of the majority of this poll.  Bad form, Michael!</p>
<p>We have gotten so far off track in this country that we no longer have the very things that this country was founded on.  So the questions become, who will restore states&#8217; rights, personal privacy, genuine competition in all industries, and America&#8217;s standing in the rest of the world?  Who will stop the arrogant foreign policies that have instigated so much bloodshed recently?  Who will stop wasting our economic prowess on lobbied endeavors that are bankrupting us now?  Who will empower the American people to dump their apathy and become involved in their government again?  There&#8217;s only one candidate with a passionate enough support to be able to call to the citizens and get congress to change some of these things.</p>
<p>I have personally converted over a hundred people to this more clear understanding and will continue to do so.  It&#8217;s amazing how easy it is when you have facts plus Paul&#8217;s pristine record to back it up.  How many McCain supporters can say that?</p>

<p>What I am referring to is the principle of setting laws governing how industries should or should operate. The tax-payer supported R&amp;D at the Department of Defense, private and public universities and other organizations in academia starting 46 years ago (oh yeah and Al Gore!) &#8211; were not laws determining how anyone or any company should operate.</p>
<p>You are referring to the devlopment of a collection of process definitions, http://, html, imap etc that developed over time &#8211; that were handed over to the public domain by the owners of that intellectual property: the people of the contributing governments and institutions. They are not laws saying individuals and companies should or shouldn&#8217;t use these processes in any particular ways &#8211; or even, if people Have to use those protocols&#8230;</p>
<p>(Though you do have to ask should governments be in the business of creating industries that upset other industries? Or would it be better to encourage such growth by reducing the barriers for private people and companies (&amp; private dollars looking for smart returns) to create these things themselves?)</p>
<p>Was there a law that said private industry or anyone else couldn&#8217;t create their own competing network? Was there a law that said any commercial use of these protocols had to conform to any mandates? Where were the laws telling companies and individuals how they should or shouldn&#8217;t Use it? Thankfully, there were none &#8211; and mostly to this day there are still none.</p>
<p>Imagine if someone in congress decades ago actually thought getting entangled in the unknown, nascent technology could bring votes &#8211; (and perhaps backed with lobbying dollars from Ma Bell for instance) &#8211; and thought they knew what the internet should look like decades ago? Imagine that the government&#8217;s role and it&#8217;s control actually extended past the initial r&amp;d of offering the world an optional protocol framework? Imagine if the rules of the game in this new, still-developing area were Mandated by Congressional law?</p>
<p>Scary.</p>
<p>And we are still in the early days here&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m someone who won&#8217;t vote for Ron Paul. But I am curious what kind of journalistic research/data you used to come to the conclusion: “People tend to have few choices when it comes to Internet or mobile providers. In those cases using government to force a level playing field and open access is what actually stimulates economic growth.”</p>
<p>Ie, that a government-regulated internet favoring the appeals of one set of large companies at the expense of another set of large companies is in the interest&#8217;s best interest &#8211; or that it creates a &#8220;level playing field&#8221;?</p>
<p>And regarding principle: I wonder your reaction if a similarly zany law passed that regulated blogs and your TechCrunch business were to pass re: the 129 post.</p>

<p>Actually, we&#8217;re angry American patriots.  I&#8217;ve watched many presidents come and go.  Each with their own wrapper and the same chewey nuget.  They all promise to make this big change and then nothing but the same or worse.  Genuine character and track record are about the only things you can really count on.  This is the only candidate I&#8217;ve seen since the late 60&#8242;s that has both on his side.</p>
<p>The reason we&#8217;re &#8216;angry&#8217; is that this opportunity is being stolen by the MSM by slighting, slander and omission in their reporting.  We, online, have only one medium of free communication left where big brother or some corporate interest isn&#8217;t filtering or summarizing our opinions for us.  Your selling out is threatening that last venue.  What are you going to tell your kids and grandkids when they ask you when they find out about Ron Paul&#8217;s campaignin 30 years why people in the 00&#8242;s put &#8216;just another corporate lawyer or lying warmonger&#8217; in office?</p>

<p>The research is all posted at <a href="http://primaries.techcrunch.com" rel="nofollow">http://primaries.techcrunch.com</a> &#8211; we have, as far as it&#8217;s been stated, the candidates positions on the ten key questions.</p>
<p>To everyone angry with the way we&#8217;ve bifurcated user voting and our official endorsement: get over it. I see this as a dual endorsement &#8211; what the readers think and what we think. Both are being reported in the press (watch the clip above where I talk about Ron Paul before John McCain). I carefully presented my reasons for going with McCain above. And after talking with Ron Paul directly, I stand by that endorsement. To suggest that I should not be allowed to put my own opinions next to those of our readers shows a gross misunderstanding of what this blog stands for.</p>
<p>And oh yeah. MSM isn&#8217;t silencing Ron Paul. He just hasn&#8217;t gotten the attention to warrant it. MSM wants and needs attention. Ron Paul&#8217;s actual support is so small that he&#8217;s off the radar for them. Just like Mike Gravel and Dennis Kucinich, who we&#8217;ve also interviewed. We&#8217;ve given these candidates a forum, and it&#8217;s up to readers to judge them. As much as you people love Ron Paul (I like him too, a lot), he ain&#8217;t going to be our next president.</p>

<p>Yes, monopolistic carriers&#8230; as in regional monopolies.  Most parts of the country only have one highspeed ISP available to serve the people, and have been able to successfully elbow out any competitors from entering.</p>

<p>Obama is the only candidate with a strategy for change not some pieced together plan to just get elected. He is also not taking fundings from lobbyist or PAC&#8217;s so he doesn&#8217;t owe anything to anyone.</p>
<p>Also John you seem to be focused on just the internet or ISP&#8217;s, technology is bigger than just that. I am more worried about giving the little guy the opportunity to compete with the big guy. Their shouldn&#8217;t be any government contracts given to any large corporations, but rather given to smaller corporations and managed on a state level. Spread the wealth. Obama is for the middle and lower class, the mom and pop, and the startups.</p>

<p>I hope you learned your lesson and will never again deign to think about expressing your own opinion here on this site. In the future, please pay close attention to online poll results (but not offline polls, mind you, and indeed, only those polls which you yourself run) and, without so much as verifying the validity of said poll results, modify the position you think you hold so as to be in accordance with the voice of the voting majority.</p>
<p>Dare not to fly in the face of the mob opinion, lest ye be flogged and waterboarded into submission. What, did you think that America was founded on the principle of individual freedom? No no no. The point of an endorsement should have absolutely nothing to do with how *you* feel after having done research and spoken to candidates and thinkers and advocates. It should be based solely and exclusively on whomever has the loudest, most mobile group of support.</p>
<p>Gosh, Michael, I thought you were smarter than all that.</p>
<p>Next time maybe just publish a worthless post with some poll results that can already be seen on countless other pages.</p>
<p>Take my advice, and you&#8217;re golden.</p>
<p>Courteously,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<p>What I want to know, though, is your logic for backing the principle of government meddling in the internet industry (even when a large portion of your audience seems to say &#8220;hey a Hands-Off-candidate should gets bonus points &#8211; not the other way around&#8221;).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just hard to understand how someone who has benefited so much from a hands-off  gov internet policy justifies how he wants others to be regulated in this domain.</p>
<p>Neither your article nor the link you just posted says why government regulation is helpful for growth&#8230; yet you base your choices on what looks like a fairly blind acceptance of those who support the buzzwords of the day&#8230;</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t want angry readers, then do not go back on your word.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if there are so many people who like Ron Paul the most, but will not vote for him because of a mob mentality&#8230;</p>
<p>We might as well give up the country to the Bolshevik Hilary, or the Super-Socialist Barrack Obama.  In the future when the highly productive people flee the oppression of extreme taxation to countries like Ireland, you will look back on the year of 2008 and be sad that you did not have the courage to stand up for correct principles.</p>

<p>One of your latest comments have now solidified my feeling of never visiting TechCrunch again. Well probably not never, who knows, but you guys have lost me as a reader.</p>
<p>you showed our opinion and your opinion [Not TC's right?] of who you support. That is perfectly fine; this is America after all.</p>
<p>What did it for me is<br />
&#8220;And oh yeah. MSM isn’t silencing Ron Paul. He just hasn’t gotten the attention to warrant it. MSM wants and needs attention. Ron Paul’s actual support is so small that he’s off the radar for them. Just like Mike Gravel and Dennis Kucinich, who we’ve also interviewed. We’ve given these candidates a forum, and it’s up to readers to judge them. As much as you people love Ron Paul (I like him too, a lot), he ain’t going to be our next president.&#8221;</p>
<p>What planet do you live? Uranus? Mars? if you actually lived in America, I don&#8217;t know if you do, but if you do, then please tell me how Ron Paul has little support? Official Polls don&#8217;t count. I am an immigrant and it disgusts me the way the MSM and obviously you know, treat and think about Ron Paul. Of course the MSM has a HUUUUGE bias about him&#8230;I mean c&#8217;mon&#8230;are you joking me? This is a man who is fighting for your freedoms to be FREE. I guess that doesn&#8217;t mean much these days as to someone who comes from an oppresive regime in a 3rd world country.</p>
<p>Shame on you sir for that statement. Shame on your ignorace. It doesn&#8217;t take a conspiracy theorist to see how badly the MSM tries to ignore him DESPITE HIS HUGE SUPPORT ACROSS THE WORLD.</p>

<p>Seriously, he receives 10 percent in Iowa and beats Guilliani(sp?) and Fox excludes him from a debate while Rudy is allowed in even with a poor showing. The power of a private corporation to make it&#8217;s own rules. I&#8217;m fine with that, but that&#8217;s bias. Heck, call me a kook, but the only excitement (besides the predictable attacks coming from the candidates) is when Ron Paul gets to speak because the truth is feisty. Also, he got 6 minutes of talk time at the last MSNBC debate out of 90 minutes even though there was only 5 candidates.</p>
<p>Also, call me a crazy, but I think it&#8217;s very exciting when a candidate who receives no coverage because he doesn&#8217;t have traction suddenly lands 2nd place in Nevada and 2nd in Louisiana(most likely first).</p>
<p>Once again, I know you haven&#8217;t been ignoring him, I know his campaign recently found out about your Q&amp;A session but that&#8217;s not what I am aiming at.</p>

<p>I am a daily visitor to this site, and this is my first comment.</p>
<p>I just wanted to add that, along with over half the internet and a sizeable portion of this nation, I am ashamed that you did not endorse Dr. Ron Paul.</p>
<p>By negating the votes that 4 out of 5 voters placed for this man, you have effectively called everyone who voted for him an idiot.<br />
Not only have you offended 73% of the readers who voted in your primaries, but have lost many of their loyal readership as well.</p>
<p>It is individuals who share in your mindset that causes the apathy of this nation.  Dr. Paul is as viable as McCain or Romney.  He is on the ballot, just like they are.  By ruling him out while he is an option, is like ruling out the Giants for making the Super Bowl because they were the 5th seed. (Giuliani would be the 6th in this case, since Dr. Paul has been beating him handily.)</p>
<p>This is ridiculous, if it was even remotely close, I would understand endorsing McCain, but he finished far behind Dr. Paul.</p>
<p>I suggest you issue an apology, respect the votes of those that support you and your website, and endorse Dr. Ron Paul instead.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Paul has a fervent base that is growing exponentially.  As his message resonates, his support keeps getting larger.  He has beaten several of the &#8220;frontrunners&#8221; multiple times, including as previously stated, two SECOND PLACE finishes, with a possible 1st place finish in Louisiana still a very real possibility once all of the provisional ballots are counted.</p>

Contrary to what you and your fellow silicon valley friends may believe, there are a lot of tech savvy people out there who OPPOSE NET NEUTRALITY.  Some of those people are Ron Paul supporters and many of those same people people are not (I find myself somewhere in between).</p>
<p>Also, you should look into the definition of &#8220;full disclosure&#8221; before your next TV appearance.  Even if you support net neutrality, be honest when you are asked to define the issue.  There is a lot more to it than &#8220;charging people more money to go to certain websites&#8221;.  Believe it or not, there are two sides, each with legitimate arguments: Network providers vs. Content providers.  The true issue is that neither side wants to foot the bill for the next generation of telecom, which is why they&#8217;ve both been lobbying congress so emphatically for the last two summers.  Network providers want to see a return [$] for all of the (govt subsidized) investments they have made in new (fiber optic) networks [see Verizon], so they are attempting to create a tiered pricing structure based on usage.  Content providers do not want to start paying more money for network usage because they have very successful business models in place that they do not want to change/alter [see Google].  I would be reluctant to change my business model too if my industry as a whole had been experiencing profit margins of nearly 30% for the last decade.</p>
<p>Next time you go on TV to shill for your silicon valley cohorts, be sure to mention that you are a corporate hack for silicon valley companies and you do not represent the opinions of the tech community as a whole.  I imagine you would expect the same from anyone advocating drilling for oil in Alaska.</p>
<p>Finally, just to clear something up about Ron Paul.  I doubt he is much more computer savvy himself then any of the other candidates.  He just strongly disagrees with all forms of government regulation and has more faith in the free market than government bureaucracy.  Right or wrong, this is why he opposes net neutrality.</p>

<p>4)  @ M Arrington</p>
<p>You say &#8220;He just isn’t getting enough traction to warrant MSM attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is just obscene. Raising $20 million in one day wasn&#8217;t enough? The amount of support he has isn&#8217;t enough? I do realize that neither of these are worthy of talking about everyday, but, more importantly, what is it that the other candidates are doing that gives them more &#8220;traction&#8221; with the news?</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they all on the same campaign trail, essentially doing the same thing?</p>
<p>I thought so&#8230;</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-683263" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good going, Michael Arrington. I particularly liked your paraphrase of the   Staples Singers at the end of the endorsement. Let&#8217;s hear for cultural literacy!  It is especially notable because some of the most culturally illiterate people in the country are accosting you. The Paulites have no real grasp of how our culture works. If they did, they would know the gold standard will not be returning. That the Federal Reserve is not a conspiracy of the Illuminati. That even in some hellish alternative reality in which Ron Paul could be elected president he would not be able to do what he would like &#8211; abolish public education, repeal all civil rights laws (because, he says, racial segregation was better), overturn Roe v. Wade, etc.</p>
<p>As for Paul not getting enough attention, he has gotten plenty in the last month as The New Republic and other publications have discovered his decades long record of publishing blatantly racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic columns in his newsletters. According to Paul, your endorsee Barack Obama is an &#8220;animal&#8217; because he is African-American.</p>
<p>The country will better off when the elderly bigot&#8217;s campaign folds. His relative handful of followers will no longer be flooding the Internet with nonsense and Ron Paul can return to attending his semi-secret meetings with neo-Conderates and neo-Nazis. There is no worse fool than an old fool, and we have had  enough of this one.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-683268" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ok Zim,</p>
<p>I read through all of Obama&#8217;s &#8220;plan&#8221;.  While he has a few ideas that are ok, but most of them are horrible.</p>
<p>Keeping on topic of Internet regulations here&#8217;s his plan according to the &#8220;Blueprint for Change&#8221;:</p>
<p>["Protect the Openness of the Internet: Obama supports the basic principle that network providers should not be allowed to charge fees to privilege the content or applications of some web sites and Internet applications over others."]</p>
<p>You know what?!  Maybe he&#8217;s onto something.  I don&#8217;t think McDonalds should be allowed to charge me more for my Double Quarter Pounder meal than they charge for the Happy Meal, it&#8217;s just not fair!  And my State government shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to charge more for a license plate for my Dump Truck than they do for my Civic.  And the local College shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to charge more for full-time tuition than it does for part-time, and my Cable company shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to charge me extra for premium movie channels either!</p>
<p>Give me a break, this guy is an idiot.</p>
<p>As for some of his other &#8220;ideas&#8221;:</p>
<p>["Protect Striking Workers: Obama supports the right of workers to bargain collectively and strike if necessary. He will work to ban the permanent replacement of striking workers, so workers can stand up for themselves without worrying about losing their livelihoods."]</p>
<p>I guess the company and any non-union workers that are affected by the strike aren&#8217;t worth &#8220;protecting&#8221;?</p>
<p>["End Wasteful Government Spending: Obama will stop funding wasteful, obsolete federal government programs that make no financial sense."]</p>
<p>Sounds good, but&#8230;</p>
<p>["Obama has called for an end to subsidies for oil and gas companies that are enjoying record profits"]</p>
<p>And replaced it with&#8230;..</p>
<p>["Invest $150 Billion over 10 Years in Clean Energy: Obama will invest $150 billion over 10 years to advance the next-generation of biofuels and fuel infrastructure,"]</p>
<p>["Obama will also tackle wasteful spending in the Medicare program."]</p>
<p>And give us a universal healthcare mess that costs $100 Billion per year!</p>
<p>[Health Care Plan<br />
"Guaranteed Eligibility: No American will be turned away FROM ANY INSURANCE PLAN because of illness or pre-existing -conditions."<br />
"Insurers would have to issue every applicant a policy, and charge fair and stable premiums that will not depend on how -healthy you are."]</p>
<p>Gee, I wonder what forcing guaranteed eligibility will do to everyone else&#8217;s premiums?   Maybe he can force auto insurers to provide coverage to people with vehicles that are already wrecked for the same price as ones that aren&#8217;t too.</p>
<p>["His plan will force insurers to pay out a reasonable share of their premiums for patient care instead of keeping -exorbitant amounts for profits and administration. His new National Health Exchange will help increase competition by -insurers."]</p>
<p> Ahh of course!  A Government Beaureaucracy to increase competition, what a wonderful idea.  After all, It has worked so well for government education and healthcare in other countries.</p>
<p>["Strong Safety Net for Family Farmers: Obama will fight for farm programs that provide family farmers with stability and predictability."]</p>
<p>Why not just end the subsidies all together?  I&#8217;d much rather choose what food I&#8217;d like to pay for rather than the government deciding for me.</p>
<p>["Prevent Anticompetitive Behavior Against Family Farms"]</p>
<p>So, Government farm subsidies are Pro-Competitive???  This is a bit hypocritical and illogical isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>["Combat Methamphetamine: Methamphetamine use has increased 156 percent nationwide since 1996. Obama has a long record of fighting the meth epidemic. "]</p>
<p>Why not expand the war on drugs?  After all, it&#8217;s working so well.</p>
<p>["The Bush tax cuts give those who earn over $1 million dollars a tax cut nearly 160 times greater than that received by middle-income Americans."]</p>
<p>Gee Barack, maybe it has to do with those persons paying nearly 160 times more tax to begin with.  The problem is not that wealthy people are not paying enough taxes; rather everyone is paying too much.</p>
<p>["Fight Global Poverty"]<br />
["Obama will embrace the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015, and he will double our foreign assistance to $50 billion to achieve that goal."]</p>
<p>More of our money will go to corrupt foreign governments.</p>
<p>["Strengthen NATO"]<br />
["Obama will rally NATO members to contribute troops to collective security operations, urging them to invest more in reconstruction and stabilization operations, streamlining the decision-making processes, and giving NATO commanders in the field more flexibility."]</p>
<p>More War and more reduction of US Sovereignty in favor of NATO.</p>
<p>["Expand the Military"]<br />
["We have learned from Iraq that our military needs more men and women in uniform to reduce the strain on our active force. Obama will increase the size of ground forces, adding 65,000 soldiers to the Army and 27,000 Marines."]</p>
<p>Hmmm, again this is only needed if he plans on maintaining the empire.</p>

<p>Obama is the only candidate that will get you what you are asking. He will be the president of the people. The only statement Obama has made I don&#8217;t agree with is that corporations should have one seat at the table not the entire table. I am sure he is saying one seat so as to not shut down our economy by scaring everyone. I think corporations shouldn&#8217;t get a seat anywhere at any table. If the republicans want to let the market decide then sure lets let them decide without government interference or assistance. No backing airlines if they cannot compete with Southwest then let them all go out of business. Same goes for the music industry, newspapers, and soon television. And overhaul the patent system.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should understand the facts before you make stupid statements.  Yes, Arrington can &#8220;personally endorse&#8221; whomever he wishes.  The issue is that in the TechCrunch Presidential Poll, Ron Paul received 73% of the vote compared to McCain&#8217;s 16%.  Yet Arrington still went with McCain despite the fact that his readers chose Ron Paul.  No one is telling Arrington to change his personal choice, just change the TechCrunch endorsement that we all voted on.</p>

A $200/month basic connection ISP charge is not neutral to me, but neither is allowing ISP&#8217;s to create favoritism based on economic interests. And unless you really think their are &#8220;internets&#8221; and you can march off to another one, you&#8217;ve got to recognize that solutions to these issues won&#8217;t be left to the marketplace except as to who can by the most members of Congress. Left solely to the marketplace we may all discover that we can download high definition episodes of American Idol in 5 seconds and can&#8217;t get to our own home page.</p>
<p>What we need to know, and probably can&#8217;t know, is who three years from now will be the President&#8217;s Chief Advisor on Technology. And this set of interviews only slightly helps us to know how a candidate might pick that person.</p>
<p>Frankly, I want a President who is familiar with Afghanistan and China as overall economic and military issues and with healthcare policy, not &#8220;those there tubes.&#8221;</p>

<p>An election for President of the United States is not a freaking horse race. The point of both the election (and endorsements) is not to pick the winner, but rather to vote for (endorse) the candidate who most accurately reflects your views and positions. To pick someone who doesn&#8217;t accurately reflect your (or your readers&#8217;) views and position, is to reveal a shocking lack of integrity.</p>

<p>But, it IS the opportunity for people to shape the future by deciding the next President.  Let&#8217;s imagine, completely hypothetically, that it was a known FACT that only 10% of the population supports candidate C.  And let&#8217;s imagine that candidate B has 44% of the nation&#8217;s support, and is aligned with candidate C on most issues (but not all).  Candidate A has 46% of the nation&#8217;s support, but unfortunately has a penchant for eating kittens, bombing foreign nations on a whim, and stripping us of our constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Should C&#8217;s supporters bend?  Is it acceptable for them to compromise their &#8220;integrity&#8221; (as you put it) by saying &#8220;I&#8217;ll join forces with B, who agrees with much of what I believe anyway&#8221;?  Because the only way that the kitten-eating war-monger won&#8217;t win is if B joins C or if C joins B.</p>
<p>Unwavering, uncompromising, inflexible personal conviction &#8212; at what cost?</p>

I see this as a dual endorsement &#8211; what the readers think and what we think. Both are being reported in the press.  To suggest that I should not be allowed to put my own opinions next to those of our readers’ shows a gross misunderstanding of what this blog stands for.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>No you idiot, you gave all of US a &#8220;gross misunderstanding&#8221; about how you were going to present the results to the press.  You made it sound like there was going to be ONE unified result from EVERYONE presented to the media about what who we thought the next president should be based on tech credentials. What you did, without warning us, was belittle your readers opinion by making the opinion of 1 person just as prominent as that of thousands. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re pissed off.</p>
<p>And with a comment like &#8220;get over it&#8221; it&#8217;s a good thing that you don&#8217;t actually make or sell a real product for a living that you ask someone to pay for; customers don&#8217;t like to be told things like that. But I guess that&#8217;s what Web 2.0 is all about anyway right? Selling a bullshit service that anyone can do without any real business skill.</p>

While it&#8217;s very much likely this election year will be an exception&#8230;Senators historically DO NOT get elected President.  Only 3 in history have&#8230;JFK being the last one. Why is that?  Because their voting records are there for all to see.  Governor&#8217;s don&#8217;t have the type of laundry aired out.</p>

<p>Be honest, that&#8217;s what you are feeling inside.  You don&#8217;t have the &#8220;guts&#8221; to go with Paul because you want to be &#8220;mainstream&#8221; oh so bad, and you&#8217;re afraid that other media will look at you weird by promoting Paul.</p>

I did not mean to imply that RP doesn&#8217;t support free speech, I am sure that he certainly does. The point I was trying to make is that I find it odd that the people who seem to be the most angry with Mike seem to be peeved that he expressed his own opinion on his own blog, something that their candidate, RP, surely would support.</p>

<p>If you believe in Liberty, keep the Federal Government limited as our founding fathers envisioned, a large, one size fits all Government is always going to become oppressive as it already has and people like you just keep begging for more, amazing!</p>
<p>If you think our founding fathers thought that simply giving us the ability to elect the reps of our Federal Government was going to make this a free and libertarian country you need to read the Federalist and Anti-Federalist papers to see why they created an all powerful Senate where the Governors sent the reps to prevent the Feds from over-powering the states, the reasoning for the 10th amendment (which in all reality does not really exist anymore) and the reasoning for the electoral collage.</p>
<p>There cannot be true liberty when 500 people in one place have all the power to decide on everything under the sun, I don&#8217;t care how many times you vote, it will not mean anything.</p>

<p>People who make money by tips should be allowed to keep them untaxed.</p>
<p>Getting rid of the FCC media censorship controls.</p>
<p>Getting rid of the IRS &amp; possibly switching to a sales tax that brings illegal aliens &amp; corporate | individual tax cheats (who exploit tax loopholes) into the tax system.</p>
<p>Getting rid of corporate lobbying system that buys &amp; pays politicians.</p>
<p>Revaluing our devalued dollar, by going back to having the dollar be backed by something of value (Gold like before 1974)<br />
Why? Because right now&#8230;.we just print more money when we need it&#8230;.making the dollar worth less &amp; less. That means when you buy something with your paycheck.. it doesnt go very far&#8230;.because companies don&#8217;t value your dollar very much in comparison to other countries money.</p>
<p>Making a foreign policy that makes a very strong military to defend America, without telling other countries how they have to live (Which only makes them hate us).</p>
<p>Making the government much smaller which allows the taxes to go down even further.</p>
<p>Getting the government out of our private lives, by telling us what to do &amp; issuing &#8216;sneek peek&#8217; warrants that allow the govt to go into your home without your permission | take a look &amp;  leave.</p>
<p>Democrats are the same as most Republicans&#8230;.do not be misled.</p>
<p>Investigate Ron Pauls voting record. He stands now where he stood when he first took office as a congressman. All the others give typical election year opinion changing mamby pamby ness.</p>

<p>The American military pounds Iraq with Artillary, bombs, and the like, destroying large sections of cities, and infra-structures, then Halliburton comes in to rebuild. Halliburton and Halliburton associated companies have raked in ten&#8217;s of billions.</p>
<p>Obama is just like the BIG HALIBURTAN. Haliburton has contracted to build detention centers in the U.S. similiar to the one in Quantanammo Bay, Cuba. Halliburton does nothing to earn the Two Dollars for each meal an American Serviceman in Iraq eats.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/151342/a_new_chapter_in_the_ong.." rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/151342/a_new_chapter_in_the_ong..</a>.</p>
<p>Halliburton was scheduled to take control of the Dubai Ports in The United Arab Emiirate. The deal was canceled when Bush was unable to affect the transfer of the American Ports.</p>
<p>Now we see what some might suspect as similiar financial escapading from the Democrats.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Iraq&#8217;s Ministry of Electricity gave a $50 million contract to a start-up security company &#8211; Companion- owned by now-indicted businessman (TONY REZKO) Tony Rezko and a onetime Chicago cop, Daniel T. Frawley, to train Iraqi power-plant guards in the United States. An Iraqi leadership change left the deal in limbo. Now the company, Companion Security, is working to revive its contract.<br />
Involved along with Antoin &#8220;Tony&#8221; Rezco, long time friend and neighbor of Democratic Presidential hopeful Barack Obama, and former cop Daniel T. Frawley, is Aiham Alsammarae. Alsammarae was accused of financial corruption by Iraqi authorities and jailed in Iraq last year before escaping and returning here.</p>
<p>Obama should be vetted and disclose his connection to the criminal money generating underworld. Besides, his connections to the REZCO MAFIA types, his up-coming tax fraud charges &#8212; Obama needs to disclose why he is a Muslim and stop suppoting our intervention in IRAQ. It&#8217;s time to shove an introduction to this fake rip-off Obama and invite the thief pipsqueke to meet the Waukesheake Police Department.</p>

With your help and support, we can make this happen on November 4th. Stand with us now and join our team.

<p>I’m for lower taxes and smaller government, because lower taxes are better for families, property owners, and small businesses.  With lower taxes, businesses have more money to invest, hire, and provide services.  Less government bureaucracy improves the business climate, promotes economic growth, and reduces unemployment.</p>
<p>And if we limit the scope of the federal government in accordance with the constitution, we decrease spending and reducing taxes, increasing our liberty in several ways:</p>
<p>(1) Liberty is increased when government is reduced to its essential and necessary functions, because there is no longer a role for lobbyists fighting to increase pork for their favorite non-essential, unnecessary programs.</p>
<p>(2) Liberty is increased when more government functions and decisions are handled at the state and local levels, closer to the American people.</p>
<p>(3) Liberty is increased when individual citizens have more responsibility and when government has less control.</p>
<p>(4) Limited government leads to lower taxes, and with lower taxes, liberty is increased because businesses have more of their own money to invest, hire, and provide services.  Less government bureaucracy improves the business climate and promotes job growth.</p>
<p>(5) Limited government leads to lower taxes, which is better for families and property owners.  With lower taxes, liberty is increased because individuals and families have more of their own money &#8211; increased take-home pay &#8211; for their needs: food, clothing, housing, education, health insurance, and retirement.</p>
<p>(6) When people are able to provide for themselves, they are more likely to achieve prosperity and less dependent on government programs.  In turn, this leads to further reduction in government spending, allowing the remaining money to be targeted to legitimate needs, such as military veterans, orphans, and people with severe disabilities.</p>

<p>Barack Obama is a racial-minority individual, and in his heart and mind he inevitably does not endorse hate crimes committed by George W. Bush.</p>
<p>George W. Bush committed hate crimes of epic proportions and with the stench of terrorism (indicated in my blog).</p>
<p>George W. Bush did in fact commit innumerable hate crimes.</p>
<p>And I do solemnly swear by Almighty God that George W. Bush committed other hate crimes of epic proportions and with the stench of terrorism which I am not at liberty to mention.</p>
<p>Many people know what Bush did.</p>
<p>And many people will know what Bush did—even to the end of the world.</p>
<p>Bush was absolute evil.</p>
<p>Bush is now like a fugitive from justice.</p>
<p>Bush is a psychological prisoner.</p>
<p>Bush has a lot to worry about.</p>
<p>Bush can technically be prosecuted for hate crimes at any time.</p>
<p>In any case, Bush will go down in history in infamy.</p>

I am not sure where I had read it before, but anyway, it is a linguistically excellent statement, and it goes kind of like this: “If only it were possible to ban invention that bottled up memories so they never got stale and faded.” Oh wait—off the top of my head—I think the quotation came from my Lower Merion High School yearbook.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-683530" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What is the University Study Program? It is a program by the College Board which can allow students to acquire college credit at many major colleges including Stanford and University of New York. There are exams in dozens of subjects including Human Relations and Calculus.</p>
<p>Having taken a number of the examinations myself, I can attest to their validity as a wonderful program to get low cost credits. Read a textbook on the subject; I myself read a text on Psychology. The next step is to register for a proctored examination through a test center. Check the College Board website to search for testing centers around your area. Depending on the immediate area you live near there may be up to a dozen various test centers. Each exam costs $55 but there is often an additional charge stipulated by the test center which vries in price.</p>
<p>At the testing center, you will have to check in with the program coordinator. Next you will be brought into a room with terminals which run special software. The examinations are all done on computer and offers students outstanding flexibility in taking the test. One can go back to questions, mark them to review, skip questions, see the number of questions one has reminding or any number of other operations. The program also has a graphing calculator should you be taking a math examination.</p>
<p>One of the country&#8217; leading colleges which accepts test out credits is the Monterey Polytechnic Institute. Monterey Polytechnic is a private institution in Monterey Bay, CA which offers a variety of undergraduate and graduate degrees specializing in Business Administration, Professional Development, Public Adminsitration, Human Relations, and a number of other fields in the arts and sciences. Work experience degree programs are also available. Monterey Polytechnic&#8217;s flexible schedule of lecture and correspondence courses is specialized for working adults. Monterey Polytechnic is known as one of the most respected, hands on, and prestigious universities in the nation.</p>
<p>So, why should you try it? If you are currently a high school senior striving to finish up degree requirements, if you are knowledgeable in a particular field of study and want recognition for it, or if you simply want to bypass the ridiculouslarge costs imposed by universities then University Testing Program is for you. It is very cheap, usually $55 for the exam and a processing fee which is almost always under $15. It is definitely a good way to get college credit based on what you already know without sitting through an college class for a year. If you take pre-calculus in High School, for instance, there is no corresponding AP, but for college credit, consider taking a CLEP. It is one day of your life and merely an hour and a half in length. Additionally, you will find out if you pass immediately. Typically a score of over 50 is good enough for credit for most colleges. Check with your university for more information.</p>
