PREFACE 

The unit operation, liquid extraction, has rapidly assumed major indus- 
trial significance as a means of separating the components of solutions. 
Whereas simple extraction procedures have been a^Omrngn and familiar 
laboratory practice for many years, in the technical application to large- 
scale industrial processes a wide variety of complex flowsheets and equip- 
ment types has been developed, the usefulness of which has not been thor- 
oughly explored. As so frequently happens, the needs of the chemical 
industry have advanced much more rapidly than the accumulation of design 
data necessary for adequate application of these techniques. Much of the 
resulting confusion and possible hesitancy in applying extraction to separa- 
tion problems can be removed by outlining its potentialities and limitations 
in organized form. It is sincerely hoped that this book will be of service in 
this respect. 

Relatively little instruction is given in liquid extraction in undergraduate 
chemical-engineering courses, and graduate courses have been developed 
only recently. As a consequence, many chemical engineers and chemists 
who must work with extraction have had little if any formal introduction 
to the subject. It is one of the purposes of this book to provide a text 
suitable not only for organized courses, but also for those who must study 
without benefit of guidance. To this end, the book contains many illustra- 
tive examples worked out in detail and a collection of problems for student 
practice. In addition, for those who may wish to investigate sources of 
original data, fairly complete bibliographies are appended to each chapter. 
In so far as it was possible a consistent notation was used throughout the 
book; the number of mathematical symbols required was so great, however, 
that duplicate meanings for a few could not be avoided. The table of nota- 
tion at the end of each chapter provides adequate definition of these so that 
there should be no confusion. 

It is the additional purpose of this book to set forth in logical order the 
known facts concerning liquid extraction and as far as possible to establish 
from them general principles which can be used as guides in evaluation. 
It would be presumptuous to suppose that, in the present early stages of 
technical development of the operation, this has been entirely successful; 
there is as yet too much that is contradictory. Indeed, in the preparation 
of this manuscript I have been singularly impressed by the wisdom of the 
observation of Sir Charles Singer, the medical historian: "If from the facts 
no laws emerge, the facts themselves become an obstacle, not an aid, to 



vi PREFACE 

scientific advance." On the other hand, if knowledge of the shortcomings 
of our available information leads to more logically organized research and 
investigation in the future, much will have been gained. 

The contribution of many industrial firms, technical organizations and 
publications, and individuals to this book have been acknowledged at ap- 
propriate places throughout the text, but this cannot indicate the trouble 
to which many of them were put and the very considerable cooperation 
which they offered. This rather inadequate mention of their assistance is 
in no way indicative of my gratitude. In addition, I wish to thank J. C. 
Elgin, W. E. Lobo, V. S. Morello, and J. H. Rushton, who were helpful 
in many ways; and my colleagues at New York University, T. W. Davis, 
John Happel, Morris Newman, and J. E. Ricci, who read and criticized 
portions of the manuscript. Most of all my thanks are due my wife, 
Gertrude I. Treybal, who assisted so much in the preparation of the manu- 
script.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 

One of the most frequently occurring problems in the field of chemical 
engineering is the separation of the components of a liquid solution. Con- 
sider a dilute solution of two substances which it is desired to separate 
into its component parts with recovery of each in substantially pure form. 
There are available to the engineer several general techniques whereby 
this separation may be brought about, some of which may be inapplicable 
because of certain physical properties peculiar to the system at hand. 
Because of the requirement that the components be recovered in nearly 
pure form, these techniques are usually physical rather than chemical 
operations. Many depend upon the tendency of a substance, when dis- 
tributed between two insoluble phases, to come to different concentrations 
in each of the phases at equilibrium. 

Fractional distillation, whereby a portion of the solution is vaporized 
resulting in a vapor richer in one of the components than the original 
solution, may be used as a separating means. This is perhaps the opera- 
tion most frequently resorted to when both components of the original 
solution are volatile. In certain instances, however, it is found that this 
technique is inconvenient. For example, in the case of some systems, 
the enrichment occurring on partial volatilization is relatively insignificant, 
requiring the use of large amounts of heat and cooling water for reflux, 
and large equipment. In other instances, substantially complete separa- 
tion by ordinary fractional distillation is impossible because of the forma- 
tion of an azeotrope, or constant boiling mixture. In still others, high 
boiling temperatures necessitate the use of low-pressure operation in order 
to reduce the likelihood of thermal decomposition of one of the components. 
If the solute of the solution is less volatile than the solvent, then the ma- 
jority of the original solution will have to be vaporized, again with the 
expenditure of large quantities of heat and cooling water. 

For separations potentially feasible by ordinary fractional distillation 
but rendered difficult by the presence of an azeotropic mixture or by low 
relative volatility of the components, azeotropic distillation or the newly 
developed techniques of extractive distillation may sometimes be employed. 
In the case of the former, a third component is added to the original mix- 
ture which will form with one of the components of the solution an azeo- 
trope which may be separated easily from the solution. This azeotrope

must then be separated by another means. Extractive distillation involves 
the addition of a relatively nonvolatile third component which increases 
the degree of separability by distillation of the original components, and 
which itself may be separated from the mixture with ease. 

If the solute in solution is nonvolatile, the solvent may be removed by 
evaporation, resulting in the deposition of crystals of the solute after the 
solubility limit has been reached. Crystallization can also be brought 
about by cooling such a solution or by a combination of evaporation and 
cooling. Obviously the application of these types of operations is limited 
to solutions containing one nonvolatile component. 

In certain instances, it has been found that a solute may be preferentially 
adsorbed from a solution onto some activated substance such as carbon, 
alumina, silica, or certain clays. The adsorbed material may then be 
recoverable from the solid by leaching or evaporation. The number of 
successful applications of such a process has been increasing in recent years. 

The removal of a volatile solute from a relatively nonvolatile solvent 
may be accomplished by the operation of stripping, whereby some chemi- 
cally inert gas such as air is brought into intimate contact with the solution. 
The volatile material is then vaporized into the unsaturated gas and carried 
away, leaving behind the solute. The vaporized material must then be 
recovered from the gas phase by condensation (brought about by cooling 
and compressing), or adsorption. 

The addition of an inorganic salt, such as sodium chloride, will frequently 
result in the precipitation of an organic solute from its aqueous solution, 
and this constitutes the operation of "salting out." Variants of this 
operation involving the use of liquid third components are known, where 
the added material may be either entirely or only partially miscible in the 
components of the original solution. 

Liquid extraction as a means of separation may be carried out in several 
ways, all involving the distribution of a substance between two insoluble 
liquids. The original solution may be washed with a second liquid, im- 
miscible with the solvent of the original solution, thereby preferentially 
dissolving the solute. The original solution may be cooled or heated so 
that it forms two liquid phases, whereupon the concentrations of solute 
in each phase will differ. The cooling or heating may be carried out after 
the addition of a third liquid. In the most complex of these operations, 
two mutually immiscible liquids are added to the original solution, each of 
which preferentially dissolves a different component of the original (frac- 
tional extraction). On infrequent occasions simultaneous chemical reaction 
and liquid extraction occur. 

All of the operations described are applicable not only to the separation 
of two-component solutions such as that used as an example, but also, 
by proper manipulation, to the separation of multicomponent mixtures. 



INTRODUCTION 3 



Before proceeding with the detailed discussion of extraction, several 
important factors influencing the choice of one of the various separative 
operations for particular circumstances should be emphasized. It will 
frequently happen that the nature of the original solution will prevent 
application of one or more of the processes, but usually at least a limited 
choice is possible. 

1. Those operations such as azeotropic and extractive distillation, 
salting out, and liquid extraction which require the addition of extraneous 
material to the original mixture are usually considered less desirable in 
industrial practice than the others. The presence of a third component 
complicates the choice of materials of construction to ensure resistance 
to corrosion. Sometimes large inventories of a third component must be 
kept on hand, thus tying up relatively large amounts of capital. Plant 
equipment will practically always be larger for such processes, since storage 
and recovery facilities must be available, in addition to extra piping, 
pumps, etc. The processes always require solvent-recovery systems, in 
themselves consumers of heat and power. The opportunity for con- 
tamination of the ultimate product by a material not normally expected 
to be associated with it is always present. For these reasons, at least, 
such processes are to be avoided if possible. 

2. In choosing between liquid extraction and other applicable processes 
as a means of separation, cost of the operation as a whole is of primary 
interest. Distillation processes which are most frequently considered 
are inherently expensive since part of the original mixture must be vola- 
tilized, necessitating the expenditure of heat. Distillation operations 
requiring high reflux ratios are especially expensive because of the large 
heat and cooling-water requirements and also because of the large plant 
equipment required to handle large volumes of vapor. Distillation of 
dilute solutions where large quantities of solvent must be volatilized are 
expensive, especially if the solvent is water which has a high latent heat 
of vaporization. Liquid extraction is frequently useful in these cases. 

3. Liquid extraction is a means of separation based upon chemical 
characteristics rather than such physical properties as boiling point and 
relative volatility. Many industrial solutions are mixtures of substances 
of different chemical types of overlapping volatility or boiling points. 
In these cases, liquid extraction offers perhaps the only feasible method 
of separating the various chemical types short of direct chemical reaction. 

4. Liquid-extraction operations must always be followed by solvent- 
recovery systems, and these are usually distillation processes. It follows 
that the combined extraction and recovery system must be more economi- 
cal than any other single process or combination which might be applicable, 
and this is a distinct handicap operating against the choice of extraction. 

There are other more subtle differences and even similarities between 



4 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

liquid extraction and other separation operations which will be considered 
at the proper time. Despite obvious disadvantages, there are many 
situations where extraction seems to be the only method which will accom- 
plish the purpose at hand. Its potentialities have not been fully realized, 
and there are many occasions where extraction might have been chosen 
rather than another operation, had more engineering information been 
available to assist in its evaluation. 

Extraction is relatively new in chemical-engineering practice. Although 
the literature reveals several instances of the use of the operation dating 
back to before 1900, it was not until the 1930's that installations began to 
appear in appreciable numbers. Since that time, research in the subject 
has been limited, and data for design are somewhat scanty. There are 
nevertheless many basic principles which may be drawn upon to help 
the engineer in this field, and it is the purpose of this book to bring these 
together into one place. 

Four major principles must be considered in a study of the factors which 
have a bearing upon the design of extraction processes: 

1. Phase-equilibrium relationships which describe the concentrations 
of substances distributed between insoluble phases. 

2. Rates of extraction and diffusion, which depend upon the departure 
from equilibrium which exists in the system as well as physical charac- 
teristics of the fluids. 

3. Material balances, which describe the quantities of the various sub- 
stances involved in the several parts of the process. 

4. Capacities and performance characteristics of equipment. 

In what follows, these principles are each considered in some detail. 



CHAPTER 2 

LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 

There are two approaches to the study of phase equilibria, both of which 
are of importance in systematizing the large number of data which have 
been accumulated and in simplifying the gathering of new data. These 
are the phase rule (18) and the laws of distribution. 

Phase Rule. For the present purposes, this may simply be stated: 

F = N - P + 2 (2.1) 

where F = the number of degrees of freedom, or the number of independent 
variables (limited to temperature, pressure, and concentration) 
which must be fixed to define completely a system at equilib- 
rium 

N = the number of components, or the lowest number of inde- 
pendently variable constituents required to express the com- 
position of each phase 

P = the number of phases. A phase is defined as any homogeneous 
part of a system, bounded by surfaces, and capable of mechani- 
cal separation from the rest of the system 

The definition of these terms must be made most carefully for proper 
application of the rule. A complete discussion is beyond the scope of this 
book; for this and a derivation of the phase rule the reader is referred to 
the standard works of physical chemistry and others dealing specifically 
with the subject (16, 21, 53). It is important to emphasize here that the 
rule applies only to systems at equilibrium and that additional restrictions 
imposed on a system have the effect of reducing the value of F by one for 
each restriction. 

Laws of Distribution. These laws, frequently empirical, attempt to 
systematize the relationship among concentrations of various components 
in the various phases of a system at equilibrium. Unfortunately, there is 
no satisfactory rule which can be used to describe all situations, and what 
generalizations are available will be considered at the appropriate time. 

TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEMS 

Two-component liquid systems may be classified according to whether 
the components are completely or only partially miscible. In liquid 
extraction, only those systems exhibiting limited solubility are of interest, 

5

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



and these alone will be considered. From a practical viewpoint, it may be 
sometimes considered that complete immiscibility occurs, such as in the 
case of the system mercury-water, but it should be realized that actually 
all liquids dissolve in each other if only to a limited extent. 

Consider two liquids A and , exhibiting only partial miscibility. If at 
first A is added in only small amounts to , complete solution will occur. 
Since N = two components, P = two phases, one liquid and one vapor, 
F = 2 2 + 2 = 2. The system is bivariant, and the variables tem- 
perature, pressure, and concentration may be independently varied within 
limits in pairs without changing the number of phases. Thus, tempera- 
ture and concentration may both be independently varied without the 
appearance of a new phase, but the pressure will be fixed by the system as 
long as a liquid and vapor phase are present at equilibrium and is outside 
the control of the experimenter. 

As more A is added to the solution, eventually the limit of solubility 
of A in B at the prevailing temperature is reached, and further addition 
of A results in the appearance of two liquid phases which are saturated 
solutions of A in B, and of B in A. The appearance of the additional 
liquid phase results in a univariant system, and only one of the principal 
variables is now under the control of the experimenter. For example, 
at constant temperature addition of still more A will merely change the 

relative amounts of the phases present 
without affecting their composition or 
their vapor pressure. Sufficient addi- 
tional A y however, will again bring the 
system to a condition of one liquid 
phase when all the B present will dis- 
solve. Thus, for a substantial range of 
compositions for the system as a whole, 
there exist at a fixed temperature two 
liquid phases of constant composition, 
the saturated solutions. The variation 
of the composition of these saturated 
solutions with temperature is conven- 
iently shown graphically. 

Figure 2.1 is a plot of the composi- 
tions of the saturated liquid phases at 
equilibrium as a function of tempera- 
ture for a system of the type just 
described. In this diagram, the pressure is not constant but rather is the 
equilibrium vapor pressure of the various liquids; the vapor composition 
is not shown. The curve KDM shows the composition of saturated solu- 
tions of B in A as a function of temperature, and LGM those of A in B.

LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 7 

The area above the curves represents the mixtures which form a single 
liquid phase, while that below the curve represents mixtures which form 
two mutually saturating liquid solutions. Consider a mixture whose over- 
all composition and temperature are given by the point S. The two satu- 
rated solutions formed by such a mixture, called conjugate solutions, are 
those at D and (?, and the horizontal line DG which joins these is a tie line. 
It may be imagined that there are an infinite number of such horizontal 
tie lines in the area below the curve. 

Let weight fraction of A in the mixtures be D, S, and (7, respectively, 
at these points. A material balance for the entire system is 

Weight of S = weight of D + weight of G (2.2) 

A material balance for component A is 

S (weight of S) = D (weight of D) + G (weight of (?) (2.3) 
If the equations are solved simultaneously there results 

Weight of D = G - 8 _ GS (9 . 

Weight of G S - D SD 

or, as it is usually stated in words, the relative weights of the two saturated 
phases formed are inversely proportional to the lengths of the tie-line 
segments. This provides a convenient graphical method of obtaining 
material quantities. If the composition is plotted in terms of mole frac- 
tion and the quantities of the saturated solutions in moles, the same rule 
applies. 

Systems with an Upper Critical Solution Temperature. In the case 
described in Fig. 2.1, which is typified by the system phenol-water, the 
solubilities of A in B and B in A increase with increase in temperature, so 
that at some elevated temperature the two conjugate solutions become 
identical and the interface between them consequently disappears. This 
temperature, termed the critical solution temperature (C.S.T.), or conso- 
lute temperature, occurs at the point M in the figure and represents the 
temperature above which mixtures of A and B in any proportions form 
but one liquid phase. Point M is the maximum on the continuous solu- 
bility curve but is not ordinarily at the midpoint of composition, nor are 
the solubility curves ordinarily symmetrical. The C.S.T. is the point 
where the two branches of the solubility curve merge, and the constant 
temperature ordinate is tangent to the curve at this temperature. The 
phase rule may be applied to this significant point: 

N = 2 components 

P = 3 phases (2 liquid, 1 vapor) 

F = 2 3 + 2 restriction that the liquid phases be identical 

F = 1 restriction 



8 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



The restriction reduces the value of F by one to bring F = 0, and the sys- 
tem is invariant at M. The C.S.T., therefore, is a function solely of the 
two substances comprising the system. 

Systems with a Lower Critical Solution Temperature. Figure 2.2 is 
typical of the composition-temperature data for systems whose mutual 
solubility increases with decreasing temperature, as exemplified by the 
system triethylamine-water. The curve encloses an area where two 
conjugate liquid solutions form, while the area below the curve represents

mixtures forming a single liquid solution. As in the previous case, the 
area between the solubility curves may be imagined as filled with horizon- 
tal tie lines joining the conjugate solutions. The lowest point on the curve, 
M 9 is a C.S.T. for the system. Application of the phase rule to the various 
parts of the diagram leads to the same conclusions as in the previous case. 

Systems with Upper and Lower Critical Solution Temperature. In the 
case of some liquids which are only partially miscible, complete solution is 
possible both above an upper C.S.T. and below a lower C.S.T., giving 
rise to solubility curves of the type indicated in Fig. 2.3. Despite the 
several examples which have been discovered where apparently the com- 
position of both upper and lower critical points are nearly the same, there 
is no requirement that this be the case. 

Systems with No Critical Solution Temperature. A large number of 
liquid pairs form systems without upper or lower critical points. In these 
cases, a solid phase forms before the appearance of a lower C.S.T. on cool- 
ing, and on heating, a vapor-liquid critical condition (vapor phase of the 
same composition and density as one of the liquid phases) occurs. Ether

and water form such a system, and quite probably all relatively insoluble 
pairs belong to this category.

scribed.

Effect of Pressure. The temperature-composition diagrams discussed 
above were considered to be plotted at the pressure of the system, i.e., 
at the equilibrium vapor pressure of the two-component mixture, which 
varies both with temperature and in the areas of one liquid phase with com- 
position. However, it is an observed fact that the change in solubility

of the relatively immiscible liquids with externally applied pressure is very 
small and may be ignored in most situations. The nature of the effect 
may be predicted from the principle of Le Chatelier; if solution of the two 
components is accompanied by an increase in volume, it follows that an in- 
creased pressure will favor a decreased 
solubility, and vice versa. Table 2.4 
indicates the small change that occurs 
at the critical solution point for several 
systems. 

If the composition-temperature dia- 
gram for a system which has an upper 
C.S.T. is plotted at a constant pres- 
sure less than the equilibrium vapor 
pressure at the C.S.T., then it must 
be remembered that the upper C.S.T. 
will not be reached. As the tempera- 
ture increases, when the vapor pressure 
of the system reaches that of the plot 
vaporization occurs, and the vapor- 
liquid equilibria of the system must be 
considered. Thus, Fig. 2.4 is the com- 
position-temperature diagram for a 
system of the type aniline-water which has an upper C.S.T. plotted at 
745 mm. Hg pressure. The liquid-solubility curves, normally merging 
at M (167.5C.), are interrupted at 99C. by the vapor-liquid equilibria. 
This is the type of diagram obtained for systems where the vapor pres-

LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 11 

sure of the liquid phases at equilibrium is greater than that of either pure 
component. For cases where the two-liquid-phase vapor pressure is inter- 
mediate between the vapor pressures of the pure liquids, a different type 
of vapor-liquid equilibria results, but the liquid-solubility curve is again, 
interrupted. 

Effect of Impurities on the Critical Solution Temperature. The addition 
of even a small amount of a third component to a two-liquid system will 
ordinarily alter the C.S.T. considerably. Thus, for example, the addition 
of 0.2 per cent of water to glacial acetic acid raises the C.S.T. with cyclo- 
hexane from 4.2 to approximately 8.2C. Useful methods of analysis 
have been devised based on such observations. For example, the amount 
of deuterium oxide in water can be estimated by measuring the C.S.T. 
with phenol and the aromatic hydrocarbon content of petroleum fractions 
by the C.S.T. with aniline. In general, the C.S.T. will be raised if the 
added component is highly soluble in only one of the original components 
(salting out) and lowered if it is highly soluble in both. Such systems 
properly must be considered as three-component mixtures, however. 

Experimental Determination of the Solubility Curve. There are two 
general methods in common use for the determination of the solubility 
curve, based on experiments at constant composition or at constant tem- 
perature. In the case of the former, a known mixture of the two com- 
ponents is weighed out in a thick-walled test tube in such proportions that 
two liquid layers form. The tube is then sealed, allowing a vapor space for 
subsequent expansion of the liquid. The sealed tube is then shaken in 
a bath while the temperature is slowly raised or lowered, until the two 
liquid phases are replaced by a single liquid solution. The temperature 
at which this occurs is noted, and the experiment provides one point on 
the solubility curve. A check on the observed temperature can be obtained 
by reversing the temperature effect, allowing the homogeneous solution 
again to form two conjugate solutions. The temperature can ordinarily 
be determined to within 0.1 to 0.01C. without difficulty. For the 
constant-temperature procedure, one component may be titrated into a 
known quantity of the other until on shaking a slight turbidity is observed, 
the entire measurement being made at constant temperature. If analysis 
in the system is convenient, a mixture forming two liquid layers may be 
analyzed for one of the components. Ordinarily, the constant-tempera- 
ture methods are most convenient for those portions of the solubility curve 
relatively far removed from the C.S.T. or where the solubility curve is 
reasonably parallel to the temperature axis. The constant-composition 
method is superior for portions of the curve near the C.S.T., where the 
curve is more nearly parallel to the composition axis. Both methods 
may be used for a single system and the data combined, since the effect 
of pressure in the ordinary ranges is so insignificant. 



12 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



THREE-COMPONENT SYSTEMS 

As in the case of binary systems, the pressure effect on the liquid equi- 
libria is relatively insignificant. Consequently we may exclude consider- 
ation of the vapor phase as unimportant for the present purposes, confine 
discussion to condensed systems, and study only temperature and concen- 
tration variables. A graphical representation which is most useful involves 
plotting compositions on triangular coordinates and temperature at right 
angles to the plane of the composition triangle. This produces a prismatic 
figure, and it will be convenient to consider isothermal sections of the space 
diagrams. 

Triangular Coordinates. An equilateral triangle is used for representing 
compositions, use being made of the fact that the sum of the perpendiculars 
from any point within the triangle to the three sides equals the altitude 
(19). The length of the altitude is then allowed to represent 100 per cent 
composition, and the length of the perpendiculars from any point the 
percentages of the three components. Refer to Fig. 2.5. The apexes 
of the triangle represent the pure components A, B, and C, respectively. 





80 60 40 20 
FIG. 2.5. Triangular coordinates.

AD EB 

FIG. 2.6. Type 1 ternary liquid equilibria. 



Any point on the side of the triangle represents a binary mixture of the 
two components marked at the ends of the side: thus, point M is a mixture 
of 20 per cent A, 40 per cent 5, and 40 per cent C. Points outside the 
triangle represent imaginary mixtures and have constructional significance 
only. 

Several other characteristics of such plots are significant. A mixture 
at D, when added to one at JB, will form a third mixture F on the straight 
line DFE (45). Furthermore, the relative weights of D and E mixed will 
cause the point F to be so located that

LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 13 

Similarly, if E is removed from F, the point D representing the residue 
is on the straight line EF extended through F, and the above relationship 
of weights and line-segments again appli'es. Geometrical measurements 
of this sort may be used for quantitative calculations, or the weights may 
be calculated from the compositions arithmetically by material balances. 
It is clear from what has been described that all points on the line AO 
represent mixtures with constant ratios of C to B with varying amounts of 
A, and that if all of the A is removed from mixture H, the mixture at 
will result. 

Ternary Systems of Interest in Liquid Extraction. If all three compo- 
nents mix in all proportions to form homogeneous solutions, the system 
is of no importance in liquid extraction. Those where immiscibility 
occurs, and of consequent interest here, can be classified in the following 
manner: 

Type 1. Formation of one pair of partially 

miscible liquids A , ,

Type 3. Formation of three pairs of partially s p r ure 

miscible liquids 

Type 4. Formation of solid phases 

Type 1. Formation of One Pair of Partially Miscible Liquids. This 
most frequently occurring combination is typified by the isotherm shown 
in Fig. 2.6. In a system of this sort, the liquid pairs A-C and B-C are 
miscible in all proportions at the prevailing temperature; A and B are 
partially miscible, and points D and E represent the saturated solutions in 
the binary system. A typical example is available in the system benzene 
CA)-water (JS)-ethanol (C). All mixtures of the components represented 
by points in the area outside the curve DNPLE are homogeneous single- 
liquid-phase solutions, while mixtures within the area bounded by the 
curve and the line DE form two insoluble liquid layers. The curve DNPLE 
represents the saturated solutions and is called the solubility or binodal 
curve. It is ordinarily concave throughout, as shown in Fig. 2.6, but 
several cases exhibiting a change in curvature have been recorded, such as 
the system water-ethylene gly col-amyl alcohol (30) . A mixture of over-all 
composition M will form the two immiscible liquid solutions of composi- 
tions L and N, respectively, and the point M is therefore on the straight 
line LN, which is a tie line. All mixtures represented on the line LN 
form conjugate layers of the same composition, while the relative weights 
of the two layers can be calculated analytically from the compositions or 
graphically from the tie-line segments as indicated above. 

The area of heterogeneity is to be imagined as filled with an infinite 
number of tie lines, only a few of which are shown in Fig. 2.6. These are 



14 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



not parallel and ordinarily change their slope slowly in one direction with 
changing concentration. In a few systems there is a reversal of the slope, 
as in the case of water-ethyl acetate-ethanol at 0C. (3) and ethanol- 
ethyl ether-water (33). In the case of the system of Fig. 2.6, it is clear 
that component C, when added to a heterogeneous liquid mixture of A 
and B, distributes itself unequally between the two conjugate layers, with 
a greater concentration in the jB-rich solutions. As more C is added to 
such a mixture, the mutual solubility of A and B increases. At point P, 
the plait point, the two branches of the solubility curve merge, not ordi- 
narily at the maximum value of C on the curve. The tie lines shrink in 
length at higher concentrations of C until at the plait point they vanish. 
Since at the plait point two liquid layers of identical composition and 
density form, the point is a true critical condition. 

Application of the Phase Rule. For three components, F = 5 P, and 
at constant temperature and pressure, F = 3 P. For mixtures of one 
liquid phase, F = 2, and two compositions must be stated in order to deter- 
mine the system. In the area of heterogeneity with two liquid phases, 
the system is univariant; at the plait point, with the restriction that the 

two liquid phases be identical, the 
system is invariant. It is noteworthy 
that, while for binary systems the 
critical-solution point is defined if 
the pressure is fixed, in ternary sys- 
tems the critical or plait point is 
defined only at fixed temperature 
and pressure.

Effect of Temperature. A constant-pressure representation which in- 
cludes temperature as well as composition variables will be a triangular 
prism. For systems of the type just considered, two cases are of interest. 

1. Systems with no ternary C.S.T., as indicated in Fig. 2.7. The curve

in the plane AB-AB is the binary solubility-temperature relationship for 
mixtures of A and B, with a binary upper C.S.T. at PS. Points Pi, P$, P 8 , 
and P 4 are plait points of the various isothermals at the corresponding 
temperatures, and the curve through these points passes up to the binary 
C.S.T. at P B . This curve does not have a maximum within the space 
figure but reaches its highest point only in the absence of component C. 

There is therefore no ternary C.S.T. 
Figure 2.8 shows "the isotherms pro- 
jected onto the base of the prism. 
An excellent example of this type of 
system is that of diphenylhexane- 
docosane-furfural (9).

ter- 



B 



FIG. 2.10. Isotherms for a ternary system with 
a ternary critical solution temperature. 



2. Systems which have a ternary C.S.T. Refer to Fig. 2.9. In this 
case, the curve through the plait points PI, P 2 , Pa, P*, and P 5 reaches 
a ternary maximum at P 6 , which then becomes a true ternary C.S.T. 
The curve continues through P to PT, the binary C.S.T. Projections of 
the isotherms onto the base of the figure are indicated in Fig. 2.10. It 
is clear that for temperatures between that at Py and P 6 , such as that at 6 , 
there will be closed, isothermal solubility curves, with two plait points, 
P 6 and PS, while the binary pairs show individually complete miscibility. 
An example of this type of system is that of water-phenol-acetone with 
a ternary C.S.T. at 92C., and a binary C.S.T. (water-phenol) at 66C. (42). 

For ternary systems containing an incompletely miscible binary pair 
showing a lower C.S.T., or both upper and lower C.S.T.'s, it is simple 
to imagine the nature of the various space diagrams possible. 

In general, not only do the areas of heterogeneity change with changing 
temperature, as indicated in Figs. 2.7 to 2.10, but the slopes of the tie lines, 
or the distribution of component C between the insoluble layers, change as 



16 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

well. The latter effect is relatively small with moderate temperature 
changes but in most cases cannot be ignored. 

Type 2. Formation of Two Pairs of Partially Miscible Liquids. Refer 
to the isotherm, Fig. 2.11. In this case, at the temperature of the plot, 
both the liquid pairs A-B and A-C are partially miscible, while B dissolves 
in any proportion in C. The area within the band lying across the triangle 
represents mixtures which form two liquid layers, the compositions of which 
are at the ends of the tie lines through the points representing the mixtures 
as a whole. On this type of diagram there can be no plait point. Typical 
examples are the systems aniline CA)-n-heptane (B)-methyl cyclohexane 
(C) (58), and water (4)-chlorobenzene (B)-methyl ethyl ketone (C) (35). 




FIG. 2.11. Type 2 ternary liquid equilibria. 

This type of solubility diagram can be considered as having evolved from a 
simpler situation by a change in temperature, as shown in Fig. 2.12. At 
h, the solubility diagram appears like a combination of two systems of 
Type 1, with plait points at Pi and Pi. As the temperature is changed to 
fe, the area of mutual solubility changes, the plait points moving in such a 
manner that they meet. At fe, the common plait point has changed to a 
tie line, and at still further change in temperature, the type of diagram 
shown in Fig. 2.11 results. The system water-phenol-aniline exhibits this 
behavior (43). If, however, the two plait points do not meet as the area of 
mutual solubility grows smaller, then a system exhibiting three equilibrium 
liquid layers develops, as indicated in Fig. 2.13 at k. Here, any ternary 
mixture whose over-all composition lies within the area DEF will form the 
three liquid phases at Z), E, and F, and the system becomes invariant at 
constant temperature and pressure. As examples, the systems silver per- 
chlorate-water-benzene and silver perchlorate-water-toluene may be cited 
(25, 26). On further temperature change, this three-liquid area would 
ordinarily be expected to get smaller and eventually disappear, giving rise 
again to the band-type diagram of Fig. 2.11. In some cases, the banded

type of diagram results from an expansion of the heterogeneous area of a 
Type 1 system, as indicated in Fig. 2.14 (13, 27). 

As in the case of Type 1 systems, either upper, lower, or both types of 
ternary C.S.T/s may form, or there may be none.

Type 3. Formation of Three Pairs of Partially Miscible Liquids. If the 

three binary pairs are mutually only partially miscible, then at some 
temperature three separate solubility curves might appear such as at t\ 
in Fig. 2.15. If changing the temperature will cause the separate binodal 
curves to meet as at fc, Fig. 2.15, then a three-liquid area DEF, invariant 
at constant temperature and pressure, will result. At some intermediate 
temperature, two of the binodal curves might meet to give a configuration

like that of Fig. 2.13 at fe, but with an additional binodal curve. These 
types of diagrams have been relatively little investigated, but examples are 
available in the systems iron-zinc-lead (54) and succinic nitrile-ether- 
water (42). 

Type 4. Formation of Solid Phases. These systems may be very com- 
plex in the number of equilibria which may exist, and for a complete de- 
scription of the possibilities reference must be made to any of the standard 
works on the phase rule. A few of the more simple situations are of interest 
in liquid extraction, and they will be described.

FIG. 2.16. Equilibria in a ternary system 
containing a solid component. 



FIG. 2.17. Distribution of a solid between 
two insoluble liquids. 



Refer to Fig. 2.16. In this system, C is a solid at the temperature of the 
diagram, while A and B are mutually soluble liquids. As an example, the 
system ethanol (4)-water (5)-potassium fluoride (C) may be cited. D is 
the solubility of C in liquid A, and H that of C in liquid B. The area 
DABHGFED represents single-liquid-phase solutions. A solution of 
composition such as that at J, to which C is added, will eventually form 
two liquid layers where the line CJ (not shown) passes through the area 
EFGE. In this area, compositions of the equilibrium liquid layers are 
given by the tie lines which culminate in the plait point at F, and the process 
just described is the familiar one of salting out. The curve DE is the 
solubility of C in A -rich ternary solutions, and the tie lines therefore con- 
verge to the C apex, indicating that the solid phase C may be in equilibrium 
with any of the solutions along DE. The significance of the area CGHC 
is the same, except that it applies to B-rich solutions. In the area CEGC, 
three condensed phases will form, always the same irrespective of the over- 
all composition of the mixture: solid C, and saturated liquids at E and G. 

Simple extensions to cases where liquids A and B are only partially 
soluble and where solid C is distributed between the equilibrium layers are 
readily visualized. For example, in the configuration shown in Fig. 2.17, 
the situation is fundamentally similar to that in Fig. 2.16, except that the 



20 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



two-liquid-phase area is so large that it reaches to the B-A axis. The 
various areas need no additional explanation. In some instances, the 
solubility of the solid C is extremely small in an organic liquid B, so that the 
diagram appears to be considerably distorted, as in the case of sodium 
hydroxide-acetone-water (20), sodium hydroxide-isobutanol-water (17), 
and calcium chloride-methyl ethyl ketone-water (32), but the interpreta- 
tion is nevertheless the same. On the other hand, in the case of certain 
soap systems, despite the fact that the soap may be fairly insoluble in the 
pure immiscible liquids, single-phase ternary liquids containing appreciable 
quantities of all three components may exist, as shown in Fig. 2.18 (39).

Fio. 2.19. Determination of the ternary- 
liquid equilibria. 



Much more complex equilibria may arise, as in the case of the system 
succinic nitrile-ether-water at 2C. (42), where, while the binary pairs 
behave as do A, B, and C of Fig. 2.17, three separate, isothermally invariant 
ternary areas exist. Compound formation will further complicate the 
equilibria. 

Experimental Determination of the Ternary-equilibrium Data. If chem- 
ical analysis for two of the three components in the system is readily carried 
out, both tie lines and binodal curve may be determined simultaneously. 
Refer to Fig. 2.19. If a mixture of composition at M is shaken in a ther- 
mostat at the temperature corresponding to that of the diagram, then on 
standing, two layers at N and will form. These may be withdrawn, most 
conveniently if the original mixture is prepared in a separatory funnel and 
each analyzed for two components. Repetition of this procedure at 
different over-all mixture compositions will result in knowledge of the 
complete diagram. 

Ordinarily, it is difficult to make the analyses for two of the components, 
and for such cases it is necessary to determine the binodal curves separately 



LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 21 

from the tie lines. If a mixture of known weight and composition K is 
prepared and titrated with pure B while held in a thermostat, then when 
sufficient B is added to produce a solution on the solubility curve at Z/, a 
turbidity will be observed. The composition at L can be calculated from 
the amounts of the liquids used. In this manner, points along the 4 -rich 
portion of the solubility curve can be determined satisfactorily up to the 
maximum per cent C on the curve. For the J3-rich portions, it is necessary 
to titrate known mixtures of C and B with A. These data do not give the 
tie lines, however, which must be determined separately. If one component 
ofTEe three can be analytically determined easily, then equilibrium layers 
such as those at N and can be prepared from a mixture such as M , the 
layers analyzed for the component, and the position of N and determined 
since they must be on the solubility curve. For experimental details the 
work of McDonald (31), Bogin (5), and Hand (22) may be consulted. 

If analysis of all three components is difficult, it is usually possible to 
determine a physical property of mixtures along the binodal curve which 
will vary sufficiently with concentration so that it can be used for analytical 
purposes. Specific gravity, or refractive index, is frequently chosen, since 
these are simple to measure. Thus, determination of the specific gravity 
of the layers N and and reference to a plot of specific gravity vs. per cent 
C along the solubility curve will fix the position of N and 0. Modification 
of these methods can be made as necessary for other types of diagrams. 

In all of the above methods, an independent material-balance check is 
provided by the fact that the over-all composition of an equilibrium mixture 
such as M must lie on the straight line ON joining the equilibrium layers. 
On the other hand, for very rapid but perhaps less accurate work, the 
principle that the weights of the layers are inversely proportional to the 
lengths of the tie-line segments may be utilized to determine the composition 
of the conjugate layers if the binodal curve is known. If the mixture of 
known composition at M is prepared in a graduated cylinder, the volumes 
of the two equilibrium layers which form may be read directly. Their 
specific gravities may be readily determined without removal by a Westphal 
balance, and hence their relative weights calculated. Points N and on 
the phase diagram are then so located that

MO ~ weight of N ( ' 

A simple method of doing this has been described by Othmer and Tobias 
(37). 

The position of the plait point may be established experimentally by 
first locating a two-phase mixture R by trial (24). If C is added to such a 
mixture, the two liquid phases will change to a single liquid phase at the 
plait point P, with the interface between the liquid layers located near the 



22 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

center of the containing vessel until miscibility is reached. If any mixture 
other than R is used, the interface will move to the bottom or top of the 
mixture as C is added. Ordinarily, it is more convenient to locate the plait 
point by empirical treatment of the tie-line data, as explained below. 

An accurately determined ternary-phase diagram is not only essential 
to the complete understanding of liquid-extraction operations but is also 
useful in assisting in the analysis of binary and ternary mixtures where 
chemical analysis is difficult or impossible. A. S. Smith (46) has presented 
the details of this type of work. 

Rectangular Coordinates for Ternary Data. For some purposes, a plot 
of the ternary-equilibrium data on rectangular coordinates is preferable to 
the triangular plots described above. Several methods have been de- 
scribed, perhaps the most useful of which was first proposed by Janecke 
(29). For a system of the type shown in Fig. 2.6, %B/(%A + %C) is 
plotted as ordinate against %C/(%A + %C) as abscissa, to give a diagram 
of the type shown in Fig. 2.20a. In the case of systems of the type shown 
in Fig. 2.11, %A/(%B + %C) is the ordinate, %B/(%B + %C) the 
abscissa (Fig. 2.206). The special usefulness of these coordinates will be 
shown later. A. S. Smith (47) avoids the use of the triangular diagram by 
plotting, for a system of the type of Fig. 2.6, %C as ordinate against 
[%C + 2(%B)]\/3 as abscissa. In this manner, the appearance of the 
binodal curve is retained, and several other useful results follow. 

TIE-LINE CORRELATIONS FOR TERNARY SYSTEMS 

Interpolation and Extrapolation of Tie-line Data. Type 1 Systems. In 
the case of many systems described in the literature, only a few tie lines 
have been experimentally determined. Direct interpolation of such data 
on the triangular diagram, and particularly extrapolation, ordinarily leads 
to highly inaccurate results and should not be attempted. Several methods 
of dealing with the problem have been devised, however, and these will be 
found exceedingly useful in all liquid-extraction work. 

Graphical Interpolation on the Triangular Plot. In Fig. 2.21, if DE is 
a tie line, line DG may be drawn parallel to CJ5, and EF parallel to AC, the 
two constructed lines intersecting at H. A tie-line correlation curve or 
conjugation curve PHJ is then drawn through several such intersections 
obtained from corresponding known tie lines. From any point on the tie- 
line correlation curve, two constructed lines parallel, respectively, to AC 
and BC will intersect the solubility curve at concentrations corresponding 
to conjugate solutions. The curve PHJ is not straight, although the curva- 
ture is ordinarily small, and it necessarily passes through the plait point. 
The method is excellent for interpolation in cases where at least three or 
four tie lines are known but is not very precise for extrapolating any con- 
siderable distance because of the curvature of the correlation curve. The 



LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 



23 



position of the plait point can be found by extrapolation only when tie lines 
very close to the plait point are known. The method is used extensively 
in the "International Critical Tables" (28).

Since the method of Fig. 2.21 requires extension of the plot below the 
base of the triangle and since this cannot be done conveniently on the 
triangular graph paper ordinarily available, Sherwood (44) has devised a 
modification which is useful. Refer to Fig. 2.22. The construction is 
similar to that previously described, 
except that the lines EH and DH are 
drawn parallel to sides AC and AB, 
respectively, intersecting at H. The 
tie line correlation curve JHP may 
be drawn through several such inter- 
sections and passes through the plait 
point P. The correlation curve now 
falls wholly within the triangle but 
has greater curvature than previously, 
thereby somewhat lessening its use- 
fulness. 

Hand (22) presented an interesting Pjo 2 22 
method of plotting the ternary data lines. 




Graphical interpolation of tie 



24 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

in such a manner as to make the tie lines parallel to the base of the triangle, 
thus simplifying interpolation and extrapolation. The plait point is then 
at the maximum of the binodal curve. The method has not been investi- 
gated thoroughly to determine the extent of its applicability, however. 

In some cases, the tie lines when produced beyond the binodal curve all 
intersect at a single point on the extended base of the triangle (50, 51, 52), 
but the principle is not sufficiently general to be of great practical value. 
In a few isolated instances, the extended tie lines appear to be tangents of a 
curve (41). 

Distribution Curves. Many methods of plotting the concentrations of 
conjugate solutions, one against the other, have been devised for the purpose 
of correlating data and to facilitate interpolation and extrapolation. Pref- 
erably, such plots should be rectilinear for all systems, since then not only 
is extrapolation facilitated, but in addition two accurately determined tie 
lines can be used to predict the position of all other tie lines with con- 
siderable confidence. In order to describe these readily and to systematize 
them, the following notation will be used: 
X = weight fraction of component. 

Subscripts: A, B, and C refer to components A, B, and C, respec- 
tively. The first subscript refers to the component whose con- 
centration is indicated, and the second to the predominant 
component of the solution. Thus, 
XCA = weight fraction of C in an A -rich phase, 
XBB = weight fraction of B in a B-rich phase, etc. 

In Type 1 systems, C is the component distributed between the 
partially miscible components A and B (Fig. 2.6) 

1. The simplest distribution curve consists of a plot of the concentrations 
of C in the 4-rich phase (XCA) against equilibrium concentrations of C in 
the B-rich phase (XCB), on arithmetic coordinates. Figure 2.236 is typical 
for the ternary systems of the type shown in Fig. 2.23a. It will be noted 
that the resulting curve lies wholly above the 45 line, drawn in for reference, 
indicating that in this case component C, on distribution between the 
phases, favors the B-rich layers. The curve is ordinarily reasonably 
straight near the origin but necessarily terminates at the plait point on 
the 45 line. If the plait point is not on the maximum of the triangular 
binodal curve, the distribution curve will rise through a maximum, as 
shown. The ratio XCB/XCA at any point on the curve is called the dis- 
tribution coefficient, or ratio. Nernst (34) proposed that, provided the 
concentrations referred only to those molecules which are in the same con- 
dition in both phases, the distribution coefficient will be constant, irrespec- 
tive of the total concentration of distributed substance present. This 
requires that, if component C is represented by the same molecular species 
in both phases, the curve of Fig. 2.236 be a straight line. If ordinary 



LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 



25 



concentrations are used for plotting, without regard to any association, 
dissociation, or compound formation which may occur, the curve is ordi- 
narily straight for a short distance from the origin but cannot be so for its 
entire length as long as a plait point exists in the system. The simple 
distribution law

(2.7) 



therefore will apply, if at all, to very dilute solutions only. In the case of a 
solid distributed between immiscible liquids, as in Fig. 2.17, the absolute 
adherence to such a law requires that the ratio of concentrations of dis- 
tributed substance equal the ratio of the respective solubilities of the sub- 
stance in the two solvents. This never occurs except perhaps at very low 
concentrations. Ncrnst provided corrections for the total concentrations 
where association or dissociation occur, indicated in Table 2.5.

In some instances, association to polymolecules is nearly complete, so 
that a! is negligible. For a case 3 combination, the distribution ratio 
would then become 

m = -|P= (2.8) 



Plotting the concentrations on logarithmic paper would therefore yield a 
line whose slope indicates the number of simple molecules in the polymer 
[see, for example, the work of Hendrixson (23)]. Campbell (11) proposed 
the general use of logarithmic coordinates in this manner for various dis- 
tributions, but, as has been shown (30), the method cannot be relied upon 
to describe data near the plait point. The simple distribution curve itself 
is useful for interpolating data when a relatively large number of tie lines 
are available but should not be used for extrapolation.

tions of XBB on arithmetic coordinates and found that the resulting tie-line 
correlation had a pronounced curvature. However, by adjusting the scale 
of the XAA axis, the curve could be made a straight line. Thirty-three 
other systems plotted on the adjusted coordinates also gave straight lines. 
The method is similar to that of Cox (12) in the case of vapor pressures and 
requires the coordinates to be set up with a system which has been very 
completely and accurately determined. A few systems did not give 
straight lines, but in these cases the tie lines on the original triangular dia- 
gram changed their direction of slope, which occurs only in a relatively 
few systems.

where a and b are constants. Rewriting the equation to read

(2.10) 



indicates that plotting XBB against XBB/XAA on arithmetic coordinates 
will give a straight line for the tie-line data, and this eliminates the necessity 
for having the unusual coordinate system first described. 

4. Othmer and Tobias (38) have found that a plot of conjugate values of 
(1 XAA) /XAA against (1 XBB) /XBB on double logarithmic coordinates 
produced straight lines. These of course are useful for interpolation and 
extrapolation. 



LIQUID EQUILIBRIA 



27 



5. Methods 2, 3, and 4 just described suffer principally from the fact that 
the concentration of C, the distributed component, is not indicated in the 
coordinates. Hand (22) showed that a double logarithmic graph of 
XCA/XAA against XCB/XBB at equilibrium, which includes the concentra- 
tion of C in the coordinates, is ordinarily rectilinear. This method of 
plotting was first proposed by Bancroft (2). As in previous cases, those 
systems which are not represented by straight lines are those relatively rare 
cases where the direction of the tie- 
line slope changes with concentration. 
The straight lines can be represented 
by equations of the form

The significance of the constants k 
and n in these equations has been 
pointed out (54) and will be consid- 
ered later (Chap. 3). Furthermore, 
a simple method of locating the plait 
point based on this method has been 
devised (57). If on the same graph 
as the tie-line data the binodal curve 
is plotted as Xc/X B against XC/XA, 
where XA, X B , and X c are concentra- 
tions of the components at any point on the binodal curve, a single curve 
of two branches is obtained, one branch representing the A -rich layer, and 
the other the -rich layer (Fig. 2.24). At the plait point, the distinction 
between the A-rich and B-rich phases disappears. Therefore,

and

where the subscript p represents the plait point. Since the plait point 
represents a limiting tie line, the coordinates (X C A/XAA) P and (X C B/XBB) P 
must fall simultaneously on the tie-line correlation and on the binodal 
curve. Consequently, extrapolating the straight-line tie-line correlation 
to intersection with the solubility curve will locate the plait point. 

Figures 2.25, 2.26, 2.27, and 2.28 have been prepared to illustrate the 
appearance of distribution data on the various types of coordinates. For 
purposes of comparison, the same systems are shown on each. In the case 
of two, ethanol-n-butanol-water and 1,4-dioxane-benzene-water, the 
measurements have been carried up to the plait points. The first of these

is characterized by unusually high mutual solubility of the nonconsolute 
components, resulting in only 14.9 per cent as the maximum concentration 
of the distributed component. The system isopropanol-benzene-water is 
unusual in that it shows a marked reversal of the distribution ratio. Of the 
four, the systems 1,4-dioxane-benzene-water and acetone-l,l,2-trichloro- 
ethane-water offer data which are perhaps most representative of Type 1

Tobias type, and except in the case of isopropanol excellent straight lines 
are obtained up to plait-point concentrations. These authors have tested 
this coordinate system with a large number of systems and have shown it to 
be very useful generally. Figure 2.28, with the Hand type of coordinates, 
also shows excellent rectilinearity even 
up to the plait points for all data, 
with the exception again of the iso- 
propanol distribution. Here the un- 
certainty of the single point in the 
ethanol-n-butanol-water system is 
very clear. This plot has been tested 
with over sixty systems with similar 
consistently good results (56). 

Type 2 Systems. Distribution data 
for systems of this typo will appear in 
the manner indicated in Fig. 2.29, the 
point M representing the mutual solu- 
bility of the B-C binary. On a B-free 
basis, the distribution of components 
A and C give rise to a curve resembling 

isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria, as in Fig. 2.30. For example, in the case 
of the system n-heptane (4)-aniline (B)-methylcyclohexane (C), Var- 
teressian and Fenske (58) found that at equilibrium

where |9 in each case equals 1.90, the ratio of osmotic pressures of A and C 
when each alone saturates B. The similarity of these expressions to that for 
ideal vapor-liquid equilibria, where 13 is replaced by relative volatility, is 
striking. There were also several other simple relationships describing 
distributions of A and C. Dryden (15) and Darwent and Winkler (13) 
investigated the forms of these equations further and found several Type 1 
systems which could be described in similar fashion, although the relation- 
ships are not general for either Type 1 or 2. Brown (10) has studied the 
application to other Type 2 systems and furthermore pointed out that the 
plot of Bachman can be made applicable to these systems. There have 
actually been relatively few Type 2 systems studied, and generalizations are 
still uncertain.

with respect to the fourth component. 
A less confusing representation makes use 
of a regular tetrahedron (7, 8), with each 
of the triangular faces representing one 
ternary combination, as in Fig. 2.31. If 
necessary, orthogonal projection upon 
one of the boundary surfaces will per- 
mit geometrical construction on ordinary 
plane triangular coordinates. Thus, if 
the percentages of A, B, C, and D are, 
respectively, XA, X B , X c , and X D at P, 
and if projections are to be made on to

There have been very few quaternary systems which have been studied 
in detail because of the tediousness of the experimental problems. Clearly 
many combinations of ternary systems are conceivable, resulting in many 
possibilities for the quaternary equilibria. A system, chloroform-acetone- 
acetic acid-water at 25C., which is of considerable interest because 
it parallels in form many of the petroleum-mixed solvent equilibria, has been 
determined in some detail by Brancker, Hunter, and Nash (7). This 
quaternary is made up of the following ternary systems: 

1. Chloroform-water-acetic acid (Type 1). 

2. Chloroform-water-acetone (Type 1). 

3. Chloroform-acetone-acetic acid (completely miscible). 

4. Water-acetone-acetic acid (completely miscible). 

The system is remarkable in the simplicity of the relationships between the 
quatenary and various ternary equilibria. Refer to Fig. 2.32. The binodal 
curve XGY represents the solubility data for chloroform-water-acetic acid, 
and the line LK is typical of the tie lines in this ternary. Similarly, in the 
ternary chloroform-water-acetone, the binodal curve is indicated by XEY, 
with tie lines such as RS. The three-dimensional surface formed by the 
two binodal curves and the sloping lines joining them enclose the quaternary 
heterogeneous region. Any mixture whose composition can be represented 
by a point underneath this surface exists as two liquid phases, while mix-

tures represented Ly poihts outside the surface are homogeneous liquids. 
Conjugate solutions in the quaternary systems are joined by tie lines, of 
which the line QJ is typical. In this particular system, lines such as EG, 
which outline the profile of the three-dimensional figure, lie in planes per- 
pendicular to the BCD plane and are straight. Plane MNA, which is 
formed by the tie line LK and the opposite apex A, intersects a similar 
plane PTD which includes the tie line RS, in a line VH which includes the 
quaternary tie line QJ. In this system, therefore, knowledge of the two

partially miscible ternary systems alone will serve to establish completely 
the entire quaternary system. It is not known how general such simpli- 
fications are, but it has been shown (8) that certain petroleum-mixed- 
solvent systems can be represented in a similar manner. Even for such 
systems, graphical calculations are difficult to make, and, rather than use 
the orthogonal projections described above, J. C. Smith (49) has suggested 
that the tie-line data of the two nonconsolute ternaries be plotted on the 
Hand type of correlation coordinates, giving rise to two straight lines. 
Quaternary tie lines then appear as points lying between the two binary 
correlation lines. 

Quaternaries made up of two Type 1 and one Type 2 ternary systems are 
also of interest in liquid extraction. Figure 2.33 is representative of these, 
and the system naphtha CA)-butadiene CB)-isobutene (C^-furfural (D) is 
typical (48). Only a few quaternary tie lines in this system are known, 
but it is clear from the ternaries that the simplifications described in the 



34 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

previous case cannot apply here. Tetrachloroethane CA)-acetone CB)~ 
isobutanol (C)-water (D) is another of this type (17) although only the 
three-dimensional surface in this case has been determined.

MORE COMPLEX SYSTEMS 

Complete graphical representation of the equilibria in systems more 
complex than the quaternaries is exceedingly difficult. Indeed, in many 
of the multicomponent systems of industrial importance the number of 
components is so large that they cannot even be conveniently identified. 
Fortunately in many of these instances it is possible to group the compo- 
nents according to chemical type and consider the complex mixture as con- 
sisting of mixtures of the groups. An example will serve to illustrate the 
method. 

Vegetable oils such as soybean oil consist of a large number of fatty-acid 
esters of glycerol, some saturated and others unsaturated to various extents. 
The extent of unsaturation in the mixture which comprises the oil is com- 
monly measured by the "iodine number," the number of centigrams of 
iodine absorbed by 1 gm. of oil. This is an additive property. In other 
words, if 100 gm. of an oil of iodine number 50 is mixed with 100 gm. of 
an oil of iodine number 100, 200 gm. of an oil mixture whose iodine number 
is 75 would be produced. Iodine numbers for mixtures between 50 and 100 
would therefore be a direct indication of the relative amounts of the two 
original oils present. In separating the high iodine-number fractions from

those of low iodine number, therefore, with furfural as an extracting solvent, 
iodine number can be substituted for percentage as one of the coordinate 
scales (40) as in Fig. 2.34. Similarly, viscosity-gravity constant (V.G.C.) 
can be used for characterizing petroleum oils ]' .: to their degree of 
paraffinieity, and this empirical property can be used for simplification of 
graphical representation. These will be elaborated upon when the corre- 
sponding extraction processes are considered. 




Furfural 
FIG. 2.34. Use of iodine number to characterize vegetable-oil systems. 

The possibilities of using similar methods in other situations are nu- 
merous. For example, if a mixture of a large number of aldehydes incapable 
of convenient definition were to be separated by fractional extraction, the 
percentage of carbonyl oxygen as measured by precipitation with sodium 
bisulfite might be used as a characterizing property. Simplification of this 
sort is necessary in any highly complex system.

CHAPTER 3 
PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 

In all liquid-extraction process evaluation and equipment design, the 
importance of having at hand accurate liquid-equilibrium data cannot be 
overemphasized. As will be shown later, the nature of the flowsheets 
used in a process, knowledge of the rates at which extraction will occur, 
decisions as to the amount of separating solvent to employ, and detailed 
information respecting concentrations of solutions throughout the process 
all these depend upon knowledge of the phase diagram in some detail. 
Since relatively few ternary, and far fewer quaternary, systems have 
been thoroughly investigated, it will usually be necessary to gather the 
data experimentally when new processes are considered before complete 
design details can be established. If the feasibility of making a separation 
by liquid-extraction methods is being investigated for the first time, it will 
be desirable to have at hand as many sets of equilibrium data as possible in 
order that the relative value of various solvents can be compared. How- 
ever, it is clearly desirable to be able to predict the salient features of the 
phase diagrams without resort to the laboratory from properties of the 
substances involved which are readily available in the literature. In this 
manner a good many solvents which at first might be considered useful 
can frequently be eliminated and considerable time and money saved by 
restricting subsequent laboratory work to those systems which appear most 
promising. None of the methods of prediction is capable of a high order 
of accuracy, unfortunately, but nevertheless they are most useful. Even 
a qualitative indication of the direction of distribution of a solute between 
two solvents is at times of great value. 

IDEAL SOLUTIONS 

One of the most useful concepts for present purposes is that of the " ideal 
solution." There are four important characteristics of such solutions, all 
interrelated: 

1. Mixing of the constituents causes no change in the average inter- 
molecular forces of attraction. 

2. The volume of the solution is an additive property of the volume of 
the constituents over the entire range of composition. 

3. Mixing of the constituents in any proportion results in neither ab- 
sorption nor evolution of heat. 

38 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 39 

4. The total vapor pressure of the solution is a linear function of the 
composition, expressed in mole fractions, over the entire range of com- 
positions. 

Consideration of these characteristics makes it clear that only very 
special liquid pairs could conceivably form ideal solutions. It would be 
necessary that the molecules of the constituents be very similar in every 
respect, for example in structure, size, and chemical nature. Thus, solu- 
tions of optical isomers, adjacent members of an homologous series, and 
similar mixtures would be expected to be nearly ideal, but actually all 
solutions can at best only approach ideality as a limit. Solutions which 
form immiscible liquid phases are of necessity extremely nonideal, and 
extraction operations depend upon this. The extent to which solutions 
depart from ideality is manifested by deviations of the properties of the 
solutions from the characteristics listed above, and a study of these devia- 
tions will permit us to some extent to predict their behavior in extraction 
operations. The most useful characteristics of the ideal solution for these 
purposes is that of vapor pressure, since considerable information has now 
been accumulated for many mixtures on this and related properties such 
as boiling points of solutions, azeotropism, and vapor-liquid equilibria. 
Classifications of compounds acconliii"; to the effect of intermolecular 
forces on properties of mixtures also provide much useful material, but the 
second and third characteristics in the list above are of limited value owing 
to lack of experimental data to which we can refer. 

Raoult's Law. In its simplest form, as originally defined, Raoult's law 
states that for liquid solutions which are ideal, and under such conditions 
that the vapor phase follows the ideal gas law, the partial pressure p of 
any constituent of a liquid solution equals the product of its vapor pressure 
p in the pure state by its mole fraction in the solution x. For a binary 
solution, 

PA = x A pAy PB = x B p B = (1 x A )p B (3.1) 

Since the total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the 
constituents, 

Pt = PA + PB = x A p A + (1 - X A )PB (3.2) 

and it is seen that the total pressure is a linear function of the liquid com- 
position. The vapor composition will then be 



The above relationships can be very satisfactorily shown graphically, 
as in Fig. 3.1, where the lines drawn are all straight lines. Now the mole 
fraction of a component in any mixture is directly proportional to the 
number of molecules of the component present. Any molecules in the 
vapor above a liquid solution may be conceived as having escaped from 



40 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



Constant 




the liquid, and their concentration in the vapor may be looked upon as a 
measure of their escaping tendency (25). Thus, an alternative statement 
of Raoult's law which is sometimes convenient is: the escaping tendency 

of the molecules of an ideal solution 
is directly proportional to their con- 
centration in the liquid. 

Illustration 1. Mixtures of n-pentane 
and r^hexane may be expected to form 
nearly ideal solutions. Calculate the com- 
position of the vapor in equilibrium with 
a liquid containing 0.3 mole fraction pen- 
tane at 25C. 

Solution. The vapor pressures of pure 
pentane (A) and hexane (B) are, resp., 
PA " 508 mm. Hg and PB = 149 mm. Hg 
at 25C. Since XA = 0.3, by Eq. (3.1) the 
'0 X A 1.0 partial pressures of the constituents are 

Mole fraction of A in the liquid p A = 0.3(508) = 152.4 mm. Hg 

Fia. 3.1. Raoult's law for a binary solution. pa = 0.7(149) = 104.3 mm. Hg 

The total pressure of the vapor, p t - 152.4 -f 104.3 = 256.7 mm. Hg. Therefore 
[Eq. (3.3)], the mole fraction of pentane in the vapor becomes 2M = 152.4/256.7 =0.594, 
and that of hexane = y B - 104.3/256.7 = 0.406. 

Fugacity. t^Pure Substances. Under extreme conditions of temperature 
and pressure, it is not permissible to assume that the perfect gas law will 
apply. In order to retain the simple appearance of the equations and func- 
tions with which we must deal under such circumstances, Lewis (24) intro- 
duced the concept of fugacity, the use of which is very convenient. At 
constant temperature, for a pure substance (9), 

dF = v dp 
Under circumstances such that the ideal gas law is applicable, 

v = 
P 
and therefore 

RTdy 

P 

The fugacity / of the substance is defined in such a manner as to preserve 
the form of this equation: 

dF = RTdlnf = vdp (3.7) 

Integration between two conditions of pressure at constant temperature 
then gives 



dF =

PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 41 

where the superscript refers to some arbitrarily defined standard state 
for reference purposes. It is generally convenient to set / = p under 
conditions such that the substance is an ideal gas. Thus, p can be some 
conveniently low pressure, ordinarily 1 atm. The fugacity may be looked 
upon as a sort of corrected pressure which will describe the behavior of an 
actual gas in the manner of an ideal gas. It may be satisfactorily calcu- 
lated for most purposes from generalized plots of the fugacity as a function 
of reduced temperature and pressure (9, 18). The ratio /// is defined as 
activity a. 

Solutions: Raoult's law in terms of fugacities is an improvement over 
the original form, since it does not require the vapor phase to be ideal: 

h = XA/A (3.9) 

where /A = fugacity of pure liquid A at the temperature and pressure of 

the solution 
JA = fugacity of component A in solution, and in the vapor in 

equilibrium with the solution 

At equilibrium, the fugacity of a component is the same in all phases (9). 
For solutions, activity is defined in the same fashion as for pure substances, 

RT In a = RT In j- Q = P - F Q (3.10) 

a = (3.11) 

where / is the fugacity at a standard state. Several standard states are 
in common use, depending upon the nature of the solution: 

1. For solutions of nonelectrolytes, the standard state is most conven- 
iently taken as that of the pure substance, at the temperature of the solu- 
tion, and either at 1.0 atm. pressure, the vapor pressure of the substance 
at the prevailing temperature, or the pressure of the solution. For most 
purposes, where conditions are far removed from the critical state and par- 
tial molal volumes are low, the effect on activity of choosing either pressure 
designation is negligible. 

2. For solutions of electrolytes, a standard state referred to infinite 
dilution is sometimes convenient at the pressures indicated above. 

If the pure liquid is the standard state, Raoult's law becomes 

&lt;*A - 4 = XA, CLB = x B (3.12) 

JA 

Since at equilibrium in heterogeneous systems the fugacity of a component 
is the same in all phases, then if the same standard state for a substance 
is chosen for each phase, the activities of the substance in all phases are 
equal. The ratio a/x is termed activity coefficient y and for ideal solutions 

74 - 7* - 1.0 (3.13)

NONIDEAL BINARY MIXTURES 

Deviation from ideality of real liquid solutions manifests itself by depar- 
ture of the various characteristics such as partial pressure, fugacity, activity, 
and activity coefficient, from the simple linear relationships previously 
shown. Of these, perhaps the most convenient to study is the activity co- 
efficient 7. Thus, for a binary solution of A and B, 



(3 - i4) 



where the standard-state fugacities f A and / are those of the pure com- 
ponents at the temperature and pressure of the solution. Ordinarily it is 
also satisfactory to use the fugacity of the pure liquids at their own vapor 
pressure. Under conditions such that the perfect gas laws are adequate 
to describe the behavior of the gas phase,

The activity coefficient is consequently the ratio of the actual fugacity, 
partial pressure, or escaping tendency, to the ideal value of fugacity, partial 
pressure, or escaping tendency, respectively, at the indicated liquid con- 
centration. If the activity coefficient is greater than 1.0, the escaping 
tendency is abnormally large, and a positive f deviation from Raoult's 
law is indicated; if less than 1.0, the escaping tendency is lower than that 
for an ideal solution, and we have negative f deviations from Raoult's 
law. 

Illustration 2. At 760 mm. Hg total pressure, a solution of ethanol and ethyl acetate 
containing 0.30 mole fraction ethanol boils at 72.2C., and the equilibrium vapor con- 
tains 0.356 mole fraction ethanol. Calculate the activity coefficients and activities of 
the components, assuming that the perfect gas laws apply. 

Solution. At 72.2C., the vapor pressures of the pure components are: 
Ethanol: p A = 501.6 mm. Hg 

Ethyl acetate: p A = 639.7 mm. Hg 

Furthermore, 

X A = 0.30, XB = 1.0 - 0.30 = 0.70 
y A = 0.356, y B = 1.0 - 0.356 = 0.644 

Substitution in Eq. (3.15): 



a A = y A x A = 1.524(0.30) = 0.657 
Ethyl acetate: TB = - 1.093 

/. a B = VBXB = 1.093(0.70) = 0.765 

f The terms "positive" and "negative" refer to the sign of the logarithm of 7. 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 43 

Where deviations from the ideal gas law may not be ignored, the method 
utilized by Benedict, et al. (2) and Mertes and Colburn (27) is convenient. 
They express the activity coefficient as 



where V A = molal volume of liquid A 

B A = second virial coefficient of the equation of state for component 
A, v A = RT/pt + B A . It may also be conveniently obtained 
from compressibility factors, B A RT/p t (Z A 1), and, if 
necessary, generalized plots of compressibility factors (18) 

This assumes that there are insignificant volume changes on mixing the 

liquid components. 

Hlustration 3. Benedict, et al (2) report that at 760.0 mm. Hg, 64.1C., the liquid 
and vapor equilibrium compositions for the system methanol (A) -toluene (B) are, resp., 
XA = 0.692 and y A = 0.829. Calculate the toluene activity coefficient. 

Solution. 

p t = total pressure = 760.0 mm. Hg 
T = temp. = 64.1 + 273.1 = 337.2K. 

x B = 1 - 0.692 = 0.308 mole fraction toluene 

y B = 1 - 0.829 = 0.171 mole fraction toluene 

PB = vapor pressure of toluene at 64.1C. = 163.55 mm. Hg 

Critical consts. for toluene = 593.7K. and 41.6 atm. 

Reduced temp. = 337.2/593.7 = 0.568 

Reduced pressure = 760.0/41.6(760) = 0.0240

the generalized compressibility factors.)

Typical Systems. Figures 3.2 through 3.6 have been prepared to illus- 
trate the appearance of typical partial pressure, activity, and activity 
coefficient curves for various types of systems. Note that a logarithmic 
scale is used for activity coefficient. 

Figure 3.2 is perhaps typical of by far the great majority of cases which 
are encountered, showing positive Raoult's law deviations. If the positive 
deviations are sufficiently great in a system where the vapor pressures 
of the pure components are not far apart, then the total pressure p t rises

If the escaping tendencies of the 
two components are so great that 
they have difficulty in dissolving 
in one another, limited miscibility 
as in Fig. 3.4 results. Here, be- 
tween the concentrations Xi and 
2, two liquid layers are formed 
whose concentrations are #1 and 
2, and since the layers are in 
equilibrium, the partial pressure 
and activity of each component 
is the same in each layer. The 
total pressure curve contains a flat 
maximum, a condition which has 
been termed "heteroazeotropic." 
Figure 3.5 shows data of a type 
which is relatively rare, with both 
negative and positive deviations, 
while in the case of Fig. 3.6, the 
negative deviations are sufficiently 
great that an azeotrope is formed. 
In the case of all these systems, 
it should be noted that as the so- 
lution becomes more concentrated 
in any component, or as x for one 
component approaches 1.0, the 
properties of the solution approach 
ideality. Thus the curves of par- 
tial pressure and activity approach 
the ideal line tangentially near 
x = 1.0, and the activity coeffi- 
cients approach 1.0 tangentially. 
This is characteristic and may be 
used as a test of the soundness of 
the experimental data. Further-

cient become more erratic and scatter badly as the solution concentration 
approaches x = or 1.0. The activity coefficient is very sensitive to even 
small errors in measurement, and the experimental difficulties in making 
measurements on very dilute or highly concentrated solutions are con- 
siderable. Therefore it is important that not too much confidence be 
placed in a single value of activity coefficient for very dilute or very con- 
centrated solutions. 

In cases where vapor association, or electrolytic dissociation, occurs, 
the activity coefficients calculated in the ordinary fashion do not approach 
Raoult's law as the mole fraction approaches 1.0 and show other unusual 
behavior. The systems acetic acid-water, sodium chloride-water, and 
acetaldehyde-water are typical of these. 

The Gibbs-Duhem Equation. In the manner that is applicable to any 
extensive property of a solution, we may write (18) 

+-..=0 (3.18) 

T,p 

Since, from Eq. (3.10), at constant temperature, 

dF = RTd\nf, (3.19) 

Equation (3.18) becomes 



r,p ox A /T,p 

For binary solutions, 

x A + x a = 1.0 (3.21) 

and 

dx A =-dx B (3.22) 

Therefore, 



T,p 

which is the Gibbs-Duhem equation. It may also be written in terms of 
activity coefficients: 

,/iJp\ -x.(^) (3.24) 

\ dx A /T tP \ dx B /T,P 

This relationship may be used to test the thermodynamic consistency 
of activity coefficient data (5, 9, 18), for which purpose we may put it in 
the form 

[(d In y A )/dx A ] T , P = __ ZB 
(d In y B /dx A )T,p x A 

Thus, the ratio of slopes of the log y vs. XA curves should be in the ratio 
(-XB/XA)' When the activity coefficients are determined by means of 
vapor-pressure data, the restrictions of both constant temperature and 
constant pressure are impossible ones to fulfill. As will be pointed out 



48 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

however, the effect of temperature and the corresponding pressure on 
activity coefficients is frequently small, and Eq. (3.25) may be written 

(d 



__ 
(dlogy B )/dx A X A 

and for most situations used either for constant temperature or constant 
pressure. Measurements which fail to abide by Eq. (3.26) may be criti- 
cized for thermodynamic inconsistency and accepted with corresponding 
reservations. Furthermore, the integrated forms (9), 

/x A -x A 
r dlogyn (3.27) 

4 = 1 A 



log 7* = - ^ - d log JA (3.28) 



and 



are useful in determining values for either activity coefficient curve if the 
other is known. Thus, by Eq. (3.27), we may plot X B /X A as ordinate 
against log y B as abscissa, and graphically integrate from X A = 1 (or 
XB/XA = 0) to XA, whence the area under the curve equals log y A . Simi- 
larly y B can be established from y A by Eq. (3.28). Such procedures are 
also helpful in arriving at self-consistent curves to describe activity coeffi- 
cient data which scatter badly. Further discussion is to be found in the 
work of Carlson and Colburn (5). 

Integrations of the Gibbs-Duhem Equation. For n A moles of compo- 
nent A, the decrease in free energy when transferred from the pure state to 
solution in B is, according to Eq. (3.10) 



n A (F A - F A ) = n A RT Inf (3.29) 

JA 

which for an ideal solution, since f A /f A - XA, becomes 

n A (F A - n) = n A RT In X A (3.30) 

'. n A F A = n A RT In X A + n A F A (3.31) 

Similarly, for n B moles of component B, 

n B (F B - F%) = n B RT In X B (3.32) 

n B F B = n B RT In X B + n B F% (3.33) 

and the total free energy of the solution becomes 

F = (n A F A + ftB/^)ideal 

= n A RT In X A + n B RT In X B + n A F^ + n B F B (3.34) 

For a nonideal solution, 

r = yx (3.14) 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 49 

and a similar development leads to 

(n A F A + njjFfOnonideai = n A RT In X A + n B RT In X B + n A F\ + n B F% 

+ n A RT In 74 + n B RT In 7* (3.35) 

The difference in the total free energies for the ideal and nonideal cases 
is termed the excess free energy of the nonideal solution F# (31). Thus, 

Fu = n A RT In y A + n B RT In 7* (3.36) 

and 

F = n A RT In X A + n B RT In X B + n A F A + n B F% + F* (3.37)

butions to the excess free energy of interactions of the unlike molecules 
in groups of two, three, four, etc., the ultimate size of the groups con-

where M , N, and S are constants may be used to represent experimental 
data. A plot of log (TA/TB) against X A is consequently a convenient 
method of smoothing and correlating vapor-liquid equilibrium data. The 
constants may be determined from such a plot very readily, and the net 
area between the curve representing the data and the line log (JA/JB) = 
must, by Eq. (3.67), equal zero. If S = 0, the equation becomes identical 
with the Margules equations previously given. 

Limitations. 1. The Margules equations are quantitatively most useful 
for relatively symmetrical systems, i.e.j where AAB nearly equals ABA- 
They are very flexible in that they can show maximum or minimum values 
of log 7f with concentration. Differentiation of the equation shows that 
a maximum (or minimum) can be expected ABA/ AAB &gt; 2.0. Wohl has 
shown, however, that for systems of such dissymmetry the Margules equa- 
tions fail quantitatively to follow the observed data and that a better crite- 
rion for the probable appearance of a maximum is when ABA/ AAB &gt; 2 + 
(2.3 A BA/4). It is then clear that for systems of considerable dissymmetry 
without maxima the Margules equations will be inapplicable. If AAB = 
ABA) the equations reduce to the simple forms 

log 7A = A AB x 2 B , log 7* = A BA x 2 A (3.69) 

2. The van Laar equations can satisfactorily follow data showing high 
values of AAB and ABA and greater dissymmetry than the Margules equa- 
tions, but very large ratios of ABA to AAB cannot be handled. They fit 
cases where ABA/ AAB is in the neighborhood of 2 better than the Margules 
equations. These equations are more limited in the shapes of curves that 
can be obtained, however, in that they cannot show maxima or minima 
or change in sign of log 7 with changing concentration. If ABA = A A/?, 
Eq. (3.69) results, and consequently for nearly symmetrical systems there 
is little choice to be made between the van Laar or Margules equations. 

3. For unsymmetrical systems beyond the capabilities of the van Laar 
equations, the Scatchard-Hamer equations, although less convenient, are 
better. If VA = VB, they reduce to the Margules equations, while if 
AAB/ ABA = VA/VB, they reduce to those of van Laar. Carlson and Col- 
burn (5) consequently suggest that the ratio of VA/VB may be taken as 
a guide as to which of the equations are applicable. For systems that 
cannot be handled by any of these, the more complex equations suggested 
by Wohl (35) may be tried. 

4. As has been pointed out, the equations are all integrations of the 
Gibbs-Duhem relationship. They consequently cannot be applied to 
systems which when treated in the ordinary fashion apparently do not 
follow this basic relation, as in the case of dissociation of electrolytes in 
solution. 

t If log yA shows a maximum, then log 75 shows a minimum at the same concentration. 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 53 

Effect of Temperature. The dependency of activity coefficient upon 
temperature is readily derived from the basic thermodynamic relation- 
ships (5, 18, 27) : 

- (370) 

(6 ' 7()) 



6T J p RT* 

where HA = partial molal enthalpy of component A in soln. 

H Q A = molal enthalpy of pure component A at the same temp. 
This may be simplified to 

d logy A Affs , 7n 

d(l/T) 2.30312 ^"' ; 

where AH 3 = partial molal heat of solution of A. A similar equation 
may be written for component B. At infinite dilution, Eq. (3.71) becomes 

dA AB ^ Affg ,~ 72 v 

d(l/T) 2.303fl ^'' } 

where A//s = heat of solution of A at infinite dilution. Plotting log 74 
against l/T at any value of XA should therefore produce a curve whose 
slope is related to the differential heat of solution, or, at XA = 0, to the heat 
of solution at infinite dilution. Conversely, it is possible to estimate the 
effect of temperature on the activity coefficients, and for this purpose 
Eq. (3.72) is most useful. Unfortunately, not too many heat-of-solution 
data are available. 

Ordinarily, solutions which exhibit positive deviations from Raoult's law 
are formed from their constituents with an absorption of heat. AH&amp; is 
positive, therefore, and 7^ will be smaller at higher temperatures. For 
mixtures with negative deviations, the AHs is ordinarily negative. In 
both cases, therefore, the solutions ordinarily more nearly approach 
Raoult's law as the temperature is increased. Obvious exceptions to this 
rule are systems with lower critical solution temperatures, where, at least 
in the neighborhood of the lower C.S.T., the Raoult's law deviations become 
greater with increasing temperature. 

Benedict, et al. (2), and many others have included the effect of tem- 
perature as T log 7 when expressing 7 as functions of x. At values of 
X A = 0, this quantity becomes TA^s (27), which leads to the simple approx- 
imation 



This simplification cannot be general but could serve as a useful approxi- 
mation if more reliable data are lacking. Berg and McKinnis (3) have 
proposed another empirical method for so-called "regular" solutions. 

Data for a typical system are shown in Fig. 3.7, where the activity 
coefficients for ethanol in aqueous solution at 20, 40, 55, and 75C. (21),

is not great. This will be the case for most systems, and for present pur- 
poses the temperature dependency can be frequently ignored. Figure 3.8 
shows the values of log y A at XA = 0, or AAB, for this system as a function 
of temperature in accordance with Eq. (3.72).

Applications of the Integrated Equations. The usefulness of the Gibbs- 
Duhem equation for establishing the thermodynamic consistency of, and 
for smoothing, data has been pointed out. The various integrated forms 
are probably most useful for extending limited data, sometimes from even 
single measurements, and it is these applications that are most important 
for present purposes. 

1. Calculation of Activity-coefficient Curves from a Single Vapor-Liquid 
Datum. If a single vapor-liquid equilibrium measurement has been made 
(pi, x, and t/), the activity coefficients may be readily calculated by Eqs. 
(3.14) or (3.15), concentrations and activity coefficients may be substituted 
in the appropriate Gibbs-Duhem equation, and the constants AAB and ABA 
computed. The integrated equations may then be used to calculate activ- 
ity coefficients of each component of the solution over the entire concentra- 
tion range. Greatest precision will result if the single datum is known at a

frequently arises, is knowledge of the composition, temperature, and pres-

The recent indexed compilation of Horsley (17) is most useful for obtaining 
data of this sort.

Knowing the boiling points of solutions dilute in component A permits cal-

of JA at XA = 0, or AAB. Similarly, a value of ABA can be obtained. Sub- 
stitution in the appropriate integrated Gibbs-Duhem equation permits bet- 
ter estimation of the activity coefficients in the dilute range, and in this 
way, by successive approximations, reliable values of AAB and ABA are 
obtained. The activity coefficients over the entire concentration range 
may then be calculated.

In a manner similar to that for 7A, a trial value of ABA is found to be log 5.88 = 0.7694.

values of 7^ and 75 computed above. 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 59 

3. Calculation of Activity Coefficients from Compositions of Liquid and 
Vapor at Known Pressures, without Knowledge of Temperature. A method 
of calculation is suggested by Carlson and Colburn (5). As a first approxi- 
mation, a temperature is found by a&gt;-=urnmg that Raoult's law applies to 
the component present in the larger amount. This temperature permits 
a first approximation of the activity coefficients of the component present 
in lesser amount, and plotting these on semilogarithmic coordinates permits 
a first approximation of AAB and ABA- Substitution in the appropriate 
integrated form of the Gibbs-Duhem equation will give more reliable activ- 
ity coefficients, and by successive approximations final values of AAB and 
ABA are obtained. 

4. Calculation of Activity Coefficients from Mutual Solubility Data (5, 7, 
31). As the components of a solution become more and more dissimilar 
chemically, their solutions show greater and greater deviations from 
Raoult's law. Large positive deviations ultimately lead to partial immis- 
cibility. Thus, in the systems alcohol-water, we observe that methyl, 
ethyl, and propyl alcohols are completely miscible but with increasing 
deviations from Raoult's law. Butyl alcohol, with very large deviations 
when mixed with water, is only partially soluble. Similar observations can 
be made in the ketone-water systems, with acetone-water showing moder- 
ate deviations and complete miscibility, while methyl ethyl ketone and 
water show a solubility gap and large positive deviations. 

In any two phases at equilibrium, including two liquid phases, the fugaci- 
ties of each component are the same in the two phases. Provided that the 
same standard state for a substance is chosen for its condition in each phase, 
the activities of the substance in each phase are also equal. Thus, 

aAA = aAB, asA = ass (3.78) 

Consequently, 

XAA _ JAB XBA 

. 
XAB yAA XBB 



Over the range of concentrations between the solubility limits the apparent 
activity coefficients will vary inversely as the concentrations based on the 
mixture as a whole. Elimination of y's between Eq. (3.79) and any of the 
integrated Gibbs-Duhem equations therefore permits the estimation of 
AAB and ABA from the mutual solubility. Thus, the Margules equations 
lead to

In Eqs. (3.80) to (3.85), the concentrations are those of the equilibrium 
saturated solutions. In each case, the second of the equation pairs per- 
mits calculation of AAB/ A B A from the data, and the first then gives AAB. 
Colburn and Schoenborn (7) have given a graphical solution of the van Laar 
set. A similar graphical solution could be worked out for the Margules 
equations, but the additional parameter of VA/VB in the Scatchard-Hamer 
equations would make such a method awkward. 

For systems of moderately symmetrical solubility, i.e., where XAB is 
nearly equal to XAA } AAB will nearly equal ABA, and either the Margules or 
van Laar equations would be expected to be applicable. For moderate 
dissymmetry, the van Laar equations ought to be better, whereas for strong 
dissymmetry the Scatchard-Hamer equations should be used. As the 
mutual solubility decreases, these equations show larger and larger values 
of AAB and ABA and correspondingly increasing activity coefficients. 

At the critical-solution point, since XAA = XAB and XBA = XBB, Eqs. 
(3.80) to (3.85) become indeterminate. Hildebrand (15) has shown, 
however, that at the critical point (d In a)/dx and (d 2 In a)/dx 2 both equal 
zero. Applying these criteria to the van Laar equations, as an example, 
there result

which then may be used with critical-solution data. For example, if the 
system is symmetrical, so that the critical-solution composition is x = 0.5, 
the AAB = ABA = 0.868. 

Activity coefficients calculated by these methods agree fairly well for 
systems where the original equations, i.e., Eqs. (3.50) to (3.66), apply. 
Carlson and Colburn (5) and Colburn, Schoenborn, and Shilling (8) have 
shown that the van Laar constants cannot be calculated from solubility 
data for n-butanol-water and isobutanol-water, but the van Laar equations 
do not satisfactorily describe the activity coefficients obtained from vapor- 
liquid data in these systems either. 

Illustration 7. The mutual solubility of methyl ethyl ketone (A) and water (B) at 
40C. are 18.6 and 90.1 wt. per cent ketone (21). Calculate the constants AAB and ABA 
for the system, and compare with those calculated from vapor-liquid data. 

Solution, a. Calculation from solubility data. At 18.6% methyl ethyl ketone and 
81.4% water, the mole fractions of ketone and water are 0.054 and 0.946, resp. At 
90.1% ketone and 9.9% water, the mole fractions of ketone and water are 0.695 and 
0.305, resp. Therefore, 

Water layer: XAB = 0.054, XBB = 0.946 

Ketone layer: XAA 0.695, XBA = 0.305 

Since the solubility is moderately unsymmetrical, the van Laar equations will be used.

compare very favorably with the results of the solubility calculations.

Comparison of these constants with those of the previous example will illustrate again 
the effect of temperature on actiyity coefficients. 

NONIDEAL TERNARY MIXTURES 

The general principles established for ideal solutions, such as Raoult's 
law in its various forms, are of course applicable to solutions of any number 
of components. Similarly, the Gibbs-Duhem equation is applicable to 
nonideal solutions of any number of components, and as in the case of 
binary mixtures various relationships can be worked out relating the 
activity coefficients for ternary mixtures. This problem has now been 
attacked from several points of view, a most excellent summary of which is 
presented by Wohl (35). His most important results pertinent to the 
problem at hand are summarized here. 

Two-suffix Ternaries Composed of Three Symmetrical Binaries. The 
equations for this case, worked out by Benedict, et al. (2) are: 

log V A = A AB XB + A AC x* c + x B x c (A A B + A A c - ABC) (3.88) 
log y B = AABXA + A B cXc + x A x c (A A B + ABC A AC) (3.89) 
log y c = AACXA + ABC^?B + X A x B (A A c + ABC AAB) (3.90) 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 63 

The constants in these equations are those obtained from the end values 
of the activity coefficients of the three binary systems, each of which is 
symmetrical: 

AAB = limit of log JA as XA and XB &gt; 1 

= limit of log 75 as X B and X A &gt; 1 (3.91) 

AAC = limit of log 74 as XA &gt; and Xc*l 

= limit of log 7c as XG &gt; and XA 1 (3.92) 

4i?c = limit of log y B as X B * and z? 1 

= limit of log 70 as XG &gt; and X B 1 (3.93) 

Since there are no additional constants which are characteristic only of 
the ternary systems, then knowledge of the three binary systems alone 
permits calculation of the ternary-mixture activity coefficients. It is most 
important to note that, for even this most simple of situations, ordinary 
interpolation of the binary-solution data is not possible. Simple interpola- 
tion of the log 7*8 would be valid only if the Asc, AAC, and AAB 
terms in the equations were omitted. If, as is ordinarily the case, the 
constants are positive, values of log 7 will be lower than the arithmetic 
average of values from the binaries. Linear interpolation of log 74 will be 
valid only if the B-C mixtures are ideal. 

Two-suffix van Laar Equations. These are perhaps the next most simple 
equations : 



The expressions for log ys can be obtained by a "rotation" principle, 
i.e., by substituting subscripts B for A, C for B, and A for C throughout 
the equation. Thus in the equation for log 75, XB in Eq. (3.94) is changed 
to x c , AAB to ABC, A AC to ABA, etc. Similarly, in that for yc, x c in Eq. 
(3.94) is changed to XB, ABA to AAC, etc. The constants are again defined 
in terms of binary systems only: 

AAB = limit of log 74 as XA &gt; 0, XB 1

Wohl has shown that these equations are limited to those cases where

a limitation which may not be too serious. As in the previous case, the 
ternary data can be predicted from information on the binary systems alone. 
Equations Containing Ternary Constants. In the more complex cases, 
constants derivable from ternary data are included in the equations, which 
are in turn more generally useful. Thus, 

log y A = zl\A AB + 2z A (A B A ~ A - A AB )} + z 2 c [A AC + 2z A (A CA ^ - A AC )}

equations resulting are as follows:

qB qc 

In each of these cases, equations for log y B and log yc can be obtained from 
Eq. (3.97) by changing subscripts in accordance with the rotation prin- 
ciple previously described. The A constants are defined by Eq. (3.95), 
and a ternary constant C, requiring at least one ternary measurement, is 
included. In the absence of ternary data, Colburn (6) has suggested as an 
approximation that C can be estimated in the following manner: 



C = %[(A B A - A AB ) + (A AC - A CA ) + (AcB - ABC)} (3.98) 

The general applicability of these equations may be inferred from the 
discussion of the corresponding binary equations. 

More complex equations containing additional constants are also pre- 
sented by Wohl. A convenient graphical approximation of the ternary 
data from binaries is offered by Scheibel and Friedland (33). 

PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 

It will be recalled, as pointed out at the beginning of the chapter, that 
it is desirable to be able to predict the distribution of a solute between 
partially miscible solvents from a minimum of data. The discussion 
presented above now offers a means of attacking this problem in fairly sys- 
tematic fashion. In what follows, B is considered the extracting solvent 
for removing a distributed substance C from A-C solutions.

The general procedure which presumably could be followed would be to 

establish values of activity coefficients in the three binary systems (A-B y 

A-Cj and B-C) from data of the sort previously described, using the binary 

integrated forms of the Gibbs-Duhem equation to assist in extending meager 

data as necessary. From these, predic- 

tions of activity coefficients and activi- 

ties in the ternary systems can be made 

by use of the ternary integrated Gibbs- 

Duhem equations. Equilibrium ter- 

nary liquid layers then exist where 

activities of all three components are 

equal. Reference to Fig. 3.11 will 

make the last step clearer. 

Here there is shown a typical ternary 
liquid-phase diagram for a Type 1 
system, with an heterogeneous area 

MKPLN and a typical tie line KL. 

The activities of A, B, and C in the 
solution at K must equal those of A, B, and C, respectively, in the solution 
at L. Lines VK and LR represent solutions of constant activity of C. 
Similarly, TK and LS are solutions of constant activity of B, and UK 
and L W those of constant activity of A . By means of the ternary activity- 
coefficient equations it should be possible to locate points such as K and L 
where the three constant activity curves intersect. In this fashion it 
should be possible to locate both the tie lines and the solubility curve. 

Unfortunately, the activity-coefficient equations cannot conveniently 
be made explicit in terms of x, and the location of the constant activity 
curves on the triangular diagram is possible only by a lengthy series of inter- 
polations. Location of the triple intersection points becomes an even more 
difficult trial-and-error procedure. While this can be done, for practical 
purposes use of the ternary activity-coefficient equations is ordinarily 
limited to cases where the solubility curve of the ternary liquid system is 
known. For such a situation, the calculations become relatively simple, 
since it is then merely necessary to compute activities of C along the solu- 
bility curve and to join equal values on opposite sides of the curve by the 
tie lines.

tion, it should be noted that the entire prediction was based only on solubilities in two of 
the three binaries. Furthermore, there is some question concerning the accuracy of the 
aniline-heptane solubility since it is not in exact agreement with the measurements of 
Varteressian and Fenske [Ind. Eng. Chem. 29, 270 (1937)]. For use in these types of 
calculations, very accurate data are desirable.

Selectivity. It will be shown later (Chap. 4) that for purposes of obtain- 
ing a successful extraction process, the " selectivity" of a solvent is a more 
important index of its usefulness than the simple distribution coefficient of 
the consolute substance. As will be shown, selectivity of B for C is defined 
as follows: 



ft = 



(3.101) 



where the concentrations are those in the equilibrium layers. Since 
x = a/7, and since at equilibrium a C B = a C A and a A B = UAA, then 

(3.102) 

' 

Consequently this important quantity can be estimated from the data 
accumulated in the course of predicting the distribution. For a satisfac- 
tory process, must exceed unity.

well as values of yc in A- and B-rich solutions. In addition, values of yA in these solu-

With this equation, values of yA were calculated for each point on the solubility curve

B-rich solutions, plots were made of ycA vs. XCA, yes vs. XCB, TAA vs. XCA, and yAB vs. XCB* 
From these, values of y were read at concentrations corresponding to the predicted values 
of XCA and XCB of Illustration 9, as listed below. Values of ft were calculated from these

Values of the predicted ft are plotted against XCA in Fig. 3.17 as a curve, together with 
ft calculated from the tie-line data of Beech and Glasstone (loc. tit.) by Eq. (3.101). 
Agreement is seen to be very satisfactory, and since ft is greater than unity, ethyl acetate 
is a selective solvent for extracting ethanol from its water solutions.

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



Neglect of Solvent Solubility. In many instances, because of lack of 
ternary-solubility data, or merely in order to simplify the computations, the 
assumption is made that the mutual solubility of the relatively immiscible 
solvents has no effect on the activity of the distributed substance. Thus, 
if an estimate of the distribution of ethanol between benzene and water 
were to be made, one might ignore the mutual solubility of benzene and 
water and the corresponding effects on the activity of the ethanol. In such 
cases the activity coefficients of the distributed substance C in the binary 
solutions AC and EC may be calculated or estimated from limited data by 
the binary activity-coefficient equations. Activities in the binaries are 
then calculated and equilibrium values of XCA and XCB determined at equal 
values of activities of C (15). This method has been investigated fairly 
thoroughly (34), and it has been shown that in cases where the solvents 
A and B are very immiscible it can be expected to give moderately good 
results at low concentrations of the distributed substance C. In cases 
where the solvents show appreciable miscibility, a qualitative indication 
of the direction of distribution only can be relied upon.

PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION

I Tangent 



The predicted distribution curve and the measured values of Hand (14) for 25C. are 
compared in Fig. 3.19. Agreement is seen to be good at low acetone concentrations, but 
as the mutual solubility of the non/consolute components is increased by higher acetone 
concentrations, the method fails to give good 
results. Nevertheless, the conclusion is reached 
that the equilibrium distribution strongly favors 
the chloroform layer, and even this qualitative 
information can be most useful. 

Distribution Coefficients at Low Con- 
centrations. If the solvents A and B are 
substantially insoluble, so that the effect 
on the distribution of C is small, then the 
equations of the tangents drawn to the 
activity curves at the origin of the plot 
(Fig. 3.20) are

where y' C A = activity coefficient of C in the A-C binary at XCA =

Therefore, at equal activities for equilibrium solutions, and at zero concen- 
tration of C,

The initial slope of the distribution curve, or the distribution coefficient at 
zero concentration of C becomes

Equations (3.106) to (3.108) offer very quick indications of the direction 
of distribution, which information is often sufficient to eliminate further 
consideration of a system for liquid-extraction purposes. 

The selectivity at low concentrations can also be easily approximated. 
Combining Eqs. (3.101) and (3.106), we obtain

where 0' = selectivity of B for C at zero C concentration. It can therefore 
be estimated from the distribution coefficient at zero C concentration 
and the mutual solubility of the liquids A and B. 

Illustration 13. Predict the initial distribution coefficient and selectivity for the 
system water (A)-ethyl acetate ()-isopropanol (C). 

Solution. Isopropanol (C)-ethyl acetate (B). An azeotrope for this system is reported 
("International Critical Tables") at 74.8C., 760 mm. Hg, with x c = 0.305. 

At 74.8C., the vapor pressure of isopropanol = pc - 560.4 mm. Hg, and that of ethyl 
acetate = PB = 698.0 mm. Hg. 

Eq. (3.17) : 7C = L = L356, 7. - - 1-089 



The van Laar constant [Eq. (3.60)] is therefore A C B = 0.3548. 

/. JCB at (xc = 0) = antilog 0.3548 = 2.26 

Isopropanol (C)-water (A). Vapor-liquid data at 760 mm. Hg are reported by Brunjes 
and Bogart [Ind. Eng. Chem. 36, 255 (1943)]. Their activity coefficients, when extra- 
polated to x c = 0, give J'CA = 11.7. Therefore, Eq. (3.106): 

m' - initial distribution coefficient = -p = y -^ = r-^r =5.17 

XCA yes 2.26 

The mutual solubility of water in ethyl acetate at 20C. is XAA = 0.9826 (water layer), 
XAB = 0.1321 (ester layer) (" International Critical Tables"). 
Therefore, Eq. (3.109): 

0' = initial selectivity of ethyl acetate for isopropanol 



-m'-- 5.17 = 38.4 

XAB 0.1321 

These may be compared with observed data of Beech and Glasstone (/. Chem. Soc. 
1938, 67), at 20C. The tangent to their distribution curve in mole fraction units at 
Xc = has a slope m' 4.9. Selectivities calculated from their data, when extra- 
polated to xc = 0, give 0' = 37. 

Equation (3.106) has been shown (34) to be the basis of the tie-line 
correlation of Hand, Eq. (2.11). Since in the binary B-C, XCB = XCB/XBB 
as XCB approaches zero, Eq. (3.106) can be written 



CA (3UO) 

XBB 



An exponent is then introduced to account for mutual solubility of the 
solvents at concentrations of C other than zero: 



(3.111) 
XBB \XAA/ 

where r and n are constants. This is Eq. (2.11) expressed in terms of mole 
fractions. The values of n for the two equations are the same, while the 
coefficients are related in the following manner: 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 75 

For some systems, n = 1, in which case r = m f and can be calculated by 
Eq. (3.106). 

Concentration Units. Predictions of distribution thus far described are 
based on mole fraction concentration units. It should be noted that distri- 
bution coefficients in terms of weight fractions are different from those in 
terms of mole fractions, although ordinarily the direction of distribution is 
the same for both unit systems. In a few cases, where there is an unusual 
combination of molecular weights, this will not be the case. For example, 
in the system ethanol-ethyl acetate-water, higher concentrations of 
ethanol are in the water-rich layer on a weight basis but in the ester layer 
on a mole basis. Where the ternary-solubility curve is available, correc- 
tions from one system to another can easily be made. If the distribution 
is estimated from data on the binaries alone, then at zero concentration 

of C,

and X AB = X BA = 0, then approximately

Selectivity, it should be noted, is independent of whether weight or mole

fractions are 

XBA = 0.0794 wt. fraction ester, XAA = 0.9206 wt. fraction water 
X'BB = 0.9699 wt. fraction ester, XAB = 0.0301 wt. fraction water 

M W B = mol. wt. of ethyl acetate = 88.06 
MW A = mol. wt. of water = 18.02 

Therefore, Eq. (3.113): 

X'CB = , 17 f (0.0301/18.02) + (0.9699/88.06)1 
~X'CA 1(0.9206/18.02) -f (0.0794/88.06) J 

The data of Beech and Glasstone (loc. cit.) show XCB/XCA = 1.20. 

QUATERNARY SYSTEMS 

In the process known as fractional extraction, two substances are 
simultaneously distributed between two relatively insoluble solvents, 
thus forming a quaternary system. In such a situation, let B and C be 



76 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

the distributed substances, A and D the insoluble solvents. The distribu- 
tion coefficients are then 



m B 

Selectivity in such a system is then defined as 

(3 



and, since at equilibrium the activities of each distributed substance is the 
same in all phases, 



ft - ^ (3.117) 

JCDjBA 

It is not yet possible to calculate quaternary activity coefficients in as 
reliable a fashion as for binary and ternary systems, and at best ft may be 
estimated from ternary or binary data on the assumption that the various 
distributions which occur will not influence the activity coefficients. Thus 
ycA/ycD might be calculated from the binary data of the systems C-A and 
C-D, or the ternary A-C-D. It is best to limit such estimates of 8 to 
systems where solvent miscibility and concentration of distributed sub- 
stances are low. 

OTHER AIDS IN PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 

In the absence of data with which to calculate activities, the direction of 
distribution can nevertheless frequently be estimated by other means. 
These will ordinarily provide only qualitative indication, however, and are 
in some cases less reliable than the methods previously described. 

Critical Solution Temperature. Figure 3.21 shows a typical ternary 
system including the temperature coordinate, with each of the binaries 
exhibiting an upper C.S.T. Suppose for the moment that each binary- 
solubility curve is completely symmetrical. We have seen that under these 
circumstances [Eqs. (3.86) and (3.87)] the A constants of the van Laar 
equations for each binary will all be equal at the respective C.S.T. 's. As- 
suming that, as is ordinarily the case, the heat of solution for each binary 
is less at higher temperatures, each binary will become more ideal as the 
temperature is increased. It follows that at any temperature, the activity 
coefficients will be lowest in the B-C binary, intermediate in the C-A 
binary, and highest in the A-B binary. Consider now the Type 1 system 
at temperature t\. From our conclusions respecting the activity coeffi- 
cients, it is apparent that C will favor the J5-rich phase, and consequently of 
the two nonconsolute solvents A and B, the more selective solvent (B) 
will be that which has the lower C.S.T. with the distributed substance C. 



PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 



77 



In the case of the Type 2 system at temperature fe, where A might be used 
to separate B and C, consideration of the activity coefficients shows that 
the system A-C has lower escaping tendencies than the system A-B. 
Consequently A will preferentially extract C. The solvent will be more 
selective toward the substance with 
which it has the lower C.S.T. Similar 
reasoning can be applied to systems 
which have lower C.S.T. 's. 

While these principles are generally 
sound, other factors will influence the 
distribution in actual situations. For 
example, the variation of heat of solution 
with temperature differs with different 
solutions, and solubility curves are rarely 
symmetrical. Consequently, critical so- 
lution temperatures can give only a rough 
indication of distribution which cannot 
always be relied upon. Elgin (11) has 
stated that it can be used safely only 
for " regular " solutions, those whose en- 
tropy of mixing approximates that for 
ideal solutions. 

In the extraction of undesirable con- 
stituents from petroleum fractions, Fran- 
cis (13) has shown the usefulness of this 
attack, and has critically reviewed earlier 
compilations of C.S.T. data. The selec- 
tive solvent ability of aniline is frequently used as an indication of the 
effectiveness of such extraction processes, and the so-called " aniline point " 
is a measure of this. Aniline point is defined as the temperature at which 
a mixture of equal volumes of aniline and hydrocarbon separates into 
two saturated liquid layers. While this is not necessarily the C.S.T. since 
the solubility curves are not exactly symmetrical, Francis has shown that 
it will approximate it very closely. A large number of aniline points for 
different hydrocarbons have been recorded, as well as the C.S.T. 's of 
hydrocarbons with other solvents (13, 36). Francis has used essentially 
the difference in C.S.T. for a solvent with two types of hydrocarbons as 
an indication of the selectivity of the solvent in separating the hydrocar- 
bons and has shown the effect on this of chemical structure of the solvent. 
Similarly, Drew and Hixson (10) and Hixson and Bockelmann (16) have 
shown the relationship between C.S.T. of propane with various fatty acids 
and their esters and the selective ability of propane as a solvent in sepa- 
rating them.

PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 79 

Table 3.1 lists several examples of the application of these principles. 
In each case the components are designated in accordance with Fig. 3.21, 
and, except for one system, the selectivities expected on the basis of critical 
solution temperatures actually materialize. In the case of propane- 
stearic acid-palmitic acid, the inability of propane to extract either of the 
acids selectively is reflected in the very small difference in C.S.T/s. Note 
further that, on the basis of the C.S.T/s alone, it would be expected 
that the selectivity of aniline for cyclohexane in the presence of heptane 
would be greater than that for methylcyclohexane, but that the reverse 
is true. 

Hydrogen Bonding and Internal Pressure. It is clear from what has 
been considered that the extent to which mixtures deviate from ideality 
governs the distribution of a solute between two solvents. It is now pos- 
sible to predict the nature of the deviation from ideality of mixtures of sub- 
stances on the basis of their hydrogen-bonding potentialities and internal 
pressures. 

The molecules of many substances are polar, that is, they exhibit a 
dipole moment caused by unequal sharing of the electrons of the covalent 
bonds of the atoms. For example, in the case of an alcohol molecule, the 
electron pair which makes up the bond between oxygen and hydrogen lies 
closer to the oxygen: 

R - 6:H 



Consequently the hydrogen portion of the molecule is relatively positively 
charged and the remainder negatively. The dipole moment is a measure 
of this phenomenon. Occasionally, molecules contain several dipole 
moment-forming groups which, because of symmetrical arrangement, cancel 
each other, and a low dipole moment results. Polar molecules tend to 
associate, with coordination of hydrogen between the negative parts of 
adjacent molecules: 

lv R rt JA. 

I I I I 

H -&gt; H -&gt; H - H 

Similarly, hydrogen can coordinate between nitrogen or fluorine, as well as 
oxygen, and these are termed " donor " atoms. Hydrogen can also coordi- 
nate between any of the donor atoms and carbon, provided that there is a 
sufficiently effective negative grouping attached to the carbon. Some of 
these bondings are strong and others comparatively weak. 

Solution of a substance into one which associates through hydrogen 
bonding may involve either breaking the hydrogen bonds or forming new 
ones. Thus, if an alcohol dissolves in water, the hydrogen bonds between 
water molecules and between alcohol molecules may be broken and new 



80 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

bonds formed between alcohol and water molecules; we may obtain a con- 
figuration of the following sort: 

H R H H R 

I I I I I 

H O -&gt; H -&gt; H -&gt; H - H 

If the size of the hydrocarbon chain of the alcohol is great, the water-to- 
water hydrogen bonding is so strong that the barely negative portion of the 
alcohol is relatively unimportant. The alcohol then does not dissolve 
appreciably. An excellent description of the role of the hydrogen bond in 
such cases is provided by McElvain (26). 

Ewell, Harrison, and Berg (12) have classified liquids into five groupings, 
based on their possibilities of forming hydrogen bonds. Their listing is 
reproduced in Table 3.2. They have also pointed out that when liquids are 
mixed, positive deviations from Raoult's law result if hydrogen bonds are 
broken, negative if they are formed. The extent to which the hydrogen 
bonds are involved will, in general, indicate the extent of the Raoult's law 
deviations. Table 3.3 reproduces their summary of these effects. 

TABLE 3.2. CLASSIFICATION OP LIQUIDS ACCORDING TO HYDROGEN BONDING* 

Class I 

Liquids capable of forming three-dimensional networks of strong hydrogen bonds, 
e.g., water, glycol, glycerol, ammo alcohols, hydroxylamine, hydroxy acids, polyphenols, 
amides, etc. Compounds such as nitromethane and acetonitrile also form three-dimen- 
sional networks of hydrogen bonds, but the bonds are much weaker than those involving 
OH and NH groups. Therefore these types of compounds are placed in Class II. 

Class II 

Other liquids composed of molecules containing both active hydrogen atoms and donor 
atoms (oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine), e.g., alcohols, acids, phenols, primary and second- 
ary amines, oximes, nitro compounds with a-hydrogen atoms, nitriles with a-hydrogen 
atoms, ammonia, hydrazine, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen cyanide, etc. 

Class III 

Liquids composed of molecules containing donor atoms but no active hydrogen atoms, 
e.g., ethers, ketones, aldehydes, esters, tertiary amines (including pyridine type), nitro 
compounds and nitriles without a-hydrogen atoms, etc. 

Class IV 

Liquids composed of molecules containing active hydrogen atoms but no donor atoms. 
These are molecules having two or three chlorine atoms on the same carbon as 
a hydrogen atom, or one chlorine on the same carbon atom and one or more chlorine 
atoms on adjacent carbon atoms, e.g., CHC1, CH 2 C1 2 , CH 8 CHC1 2 , CH 2 C1 CH 2 C1, 
CH 2 C1 CHC1 CH 2 C1, CH 2 C1 CHC1 2 , etc. 

Class V 

All other liquids, i.e., liquids having no hydrogen-bond-forming capabilities, e.g., 
hydrocarbons, carbon disulfide, sulfides, mercaptans, halohydrocarbons not in Class IV, 
nonmetallic elements such as iodine, phosphorus, and sulfur.

Society. 

It will be noted that for all mixtures of Class III, IV, and V liquids, with 
the exception of Class III with Class IV, no hydrogen bonds are involved. 
Hildebrand (15) and Scatchard (30) show that in such cases deviations 
from Raoult's law are a function of the square of the difference in square 
roots of the internal pressures of the constituents, the importance of this 
effect being minimized when hydrogen bonding is extensive. Large devia- 
tions for such solutions, in other words, result from large differences in inter- 
nal pressures. The internal pressure, in turn, can be estimated from the 
heat of vaporization and molar volumes:

sure. The enthalpy of vaporization used in calculating these were taken 
from various tabulations (21, 28) or estimated if necessary by usual methods 
(19). The farther apart two substances are on the list, the greater should 
be the deviations from ideality of their solutions. 

Illustration 15. Recommend a solvent potentially useful for extracting acetone from 
its aqueous solutions. 

Solution. Acetone is a Class III liquid and water a Class I liquid (Table 3.2). Aque- 
ous acetone solutions can be expected to give positive deviations from Raoult's law 
(Table 3.3). For a most favorable distribution coefficient, therefore, solutions of acetone 
in the extracting solvent should show negative deviations. Table 3.3 indicates that 
liquids of Class IV, such as certain of the chlorinated hydrocarbons, should provide 
favorable distribution coefficients. Halohydrocarbons of Class V would also be satis- 
factory, since their acetone solutions would show at most weakly positive deviations.

PREDICTION OF DISTRIBUTION 83 

Illustration 16. Predict the direction of distribution of acetic acid between benzene 
and water. 

Solution. Acetic acid (Class II)-benzene (Class V) solutions should show strong 
positive Raoult's law deviations, or large escaping tendency for the acid. Acetic acid 
(Class II)-water (Class I) solutions should show less strong positive deviations, or a lesser 
escaping tendency for the acid. On distribution, the acetic acid should favor the water- 
rich phase. This is confirmed by the data of Hand (14), at 25C., which show a distribu- 
tion coefficient of 30.4 in weight per cent units at low acid concentrations, favoring the 
water phase. 

Illustration 17. Predict the direction of the distribution of 1,6-diphenylhexane 
(Class V) between furfural (Class III) and docosane (Class V), at 45C. 

Solution. Since in both furfural-diphenylhexane and docosane-diphenylhexane solu- 
tions, hydrogen bonds are not involved, recourse can be had to internal-pressure data to 
indicate the distribution.

.*. The furfural solutions should show the larger + deviations, and diphenylhexane 
should favor the docosane-rich phase on distribution. 

This is confirmed by Briggs and Comings [Ind. Eng. Chem. 35, 411 (1943)] whose data 
at 45C. show distribution coefficients of 1.021 and 2.72 in weight and mole per cents, 
resp., at low concentrations of diphenylhexane.

CHAPTER 4 
CHOICE OF SOLVENT 

In choosing a solvent for a liquid-extraction process, there are several 
principles which can be used as a guide. These are frequently conflicting, 
and certainly no single substance would ordinarily possess every desirable 
characteristic. Compromises must be made, and in what follows an 
attempt will be made to indicate the relative importance of the various 
factors to be considered. 

Selectivity. This is the first property ordinarily studied in deciding the 
applicability of a solvent, and it refers to the ability of a solvent to extract 
one component of a solution in preference to another. The most desirable 
solvent from this point of view would dissolve a maximum of one com- 
ponent and a minimum of the other. 

Consider the ternary system of Fig. 4.1, where point M represents a 
solution of A and C which it is planned to separate by use of solvent B. 
Let us follow the course of a simple extraction process on this diagram. 
Upon addition of B to the solution Af, point S would represent the com- 
position of the resulting two-phase mixture as a whole. After vigorous 
agitation to ensure the attainment of equilibrium and settling of the liquid 
layers, the two insoluble equilibrium layers at R and T would result. The 
line RT is, of course, a tie lute joining the conjugate concentrations. It is 
customary in extraction operations to remove the solvent B from the 
two solutions and recover the extracted substances in solvent-free form. 
If B is removed completely from R, the binary solution at D results, while 
E represents the solvent-free solution corresponding to T. By this pro- 
cedure, the original solution at M has been separated into two solutions 
at D and E, the first of these richer in A and the second richer in C. It is 
obviously desirable that E and D be a maximum distance apart if Ke 
operation is to be most effective. 

If, for the same system, A is used as a solvent to separate a solution 
of C and 5, as shown in Fig. 4.2, it is clear that while a separation is indeed 
possible since the ultimate solutions E and D still have different composi- 
tions, the separation has not been nearly so effective as that first described. 
Obviously the direction of tie-line slope has been responsible for the differ- 
ence. Indeed, it is entirely conceivable that in Fig. 4.2 the tie line utilized 
by the operation would coincide precisely with the line AM representing 
the original addition of solvent, in which case the solutions when stripped 



CHOICE OF SOLVENT 87 

of solvent A would both have compositions identical with the original 
mixture. We may say, in the example shown, that B is more selective 
in separating solutions of A and C than A for solutions of B and C. Simi- 
larly, several solvents for separating the same binary pair may be compared. 
As a rough guide, an extended tie line will intersect that side of the triangle 
representing binary mixtures of distributed substance and the more selec- 
tive of the two nonconsolutes. 





FIG. 4.1. Selective extraction of C from FIG. 4.2. Selective extraction of C from 

A by means of solvent B. B by means of solvent A. 

Quantitatively, the property of selectivity may be demonstrated more 
satisfactorily by plotting the concentrations of the distributed substance C 
in corresponding solutions at D and E against each other, or, in other 
words, by plotting a distribution curve for C on a solvent-free basis. Two 
selectivity diagrams of this sort may be prepared for each ternary, depending 
upon which nonconsolute is considered the solvent. The curves so ob- 
tained are somewhat similar to simple distribution curves in that they 
start at the origin of the diagram, ordinarily but not necessarily pass 
through a maximum, and finish on the 45 diagonal at the plait point. 
The more highly selective the solvent, the greater will be the space between 
the 45 diagonal and the curve. If the curve coincides with the 45 di- 
agonal, no separation is possible. In many respects^ these curves are 
analogous to the constant-pressure McCabe-Thiele diagrams used for 
vapor-liquid equilibria in distillation studies (8). 

Figure 4.3 shows typical selectivity curves for two systems of the type 
shown in Fig. 4.1: benzene-water-ethanol at 25C. (9) and ethyl acetate- 
water-ethanol at 2GC. (1), ethanol being the distributed substance in 
each case. In these systems, a simple distribution curve indicates that the 
distribution of the ethanol favors the water layers in both cases. Figure 4.3 
shows that at low concentrations water is much more selective for separat- 
ing ethanol from benzene than is benzene for separating ethanol and water. 
Similarly in the ethyl acetate systems, water is the more selective solvent. 



88 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



However, if a choice were to be made between benzene and ethyl acetate 
as solvents for separating ethanol and water, clearly benzene is the more 
selective of the two. Other considerations, however, might show neither 
to be very desirable.

FIG. 4.3. Selectivity diagrams, Type 1 systems. 

In Type 2 ternary systems, similar comparisons of the selectivity of 
solvents are possible. In the case of Fig. 4.4, B is the solvent that is used 
to separate solutions of A and C, and the diagram is lettered in the same 
manner as Fig. 4.1. Consequently the selectivity diagram is plotted as 
concentrations of C in the equilibrium phases on a B-free basis. Selectivi- 
ties are ordinarily somewhat lower in this type of system than in those 
of Type 1, and two examples are shown in Fig. 4.5. 

As in the case of vapor-liquid equilibria, numerical values of the selec- 
tivity, designated as 0, are desirable, and these may be calculated in the 
same fashion as the aiuilouou* property, relative volatility, for distillation 
processes (8). Thus, the selectivity ft of B for C is defined as follows:

in which case it can be used as a correlating device for tie-line data [Eqs. 
(2.14), (2.15)]. In most cases, varies widely with concentrations, as 
shown in Fig. 4.6, where selectivities for the systems of Figs. 4.3 and 4.5 
are shown. 



CHOICE OF SOLVENT 91 

The importance of good selectivity for extraction processes parallels 
that of relative volatility for distillation. Practical processes require 
that ft exceed unity, the more so the better. Selectivities close to unity will 
result in large plant equipment, large numbers of extraction contacts or 
stages, and in general, costly investment and operation. If ft = 1, sepa- 
ration is impossible. 

Combining Eqs. (2.7) and (4.2), we see that selectivity of B for C is 
related to the distribution coefficient in the following manner: 

ft = m^ (4.4) 



Since XAA/XAB is always greater than unity, then for systems with a 
favorable distribution coefficient (m &gt; 1), ft will always exceed unity. 
Systems with an unfavorable distribution coefficient (m &lt; 1) or systems 
for which m varies from less than 1 to greater than 1 (characterized by a 
reversal of tie-line slopes) will not necessarily give values of ft less than 
unity except if the mutual solubility of the nonconsolutes A and B is con- 
siderable. 

In quaternary systems, where B and C are distributed between immiscible 
solvents A and D, the selectivity and distribution coefficients are related 
in the following manner: 

m B = f^, m c = $2d (4-5) 

A BD A CD 

and 

ma XsAXcp , A &gt;. 

P = ~ = y ^ (4-6) 



where ft is the selectivity of the solvent pair for B. As with ternary sys- 
tems, ft must exceed unity for a successful process. 

Recoverability. In all liquid-extraction processes, it is necessary to 
remove the extracting solvent from the two products resulting from the 
separation. This is important not only to avoid contamination of the 
products with the solvent but also to permit reuse of the solvent in order 
to reduce the cost of operation. In practically every instance, the recovery 
process is ultimately one of fractional distillation, and the relative vola- 
tility of the solvent and substance to be separated must be high in order 
that this may be carried out inexpensively. The existence in the system 
of azeotropes involving the solvent must be checked particularly, since 
their presence may prevent separation of the solvent by ordinary distilla- 
tion means. A very complete, indexed list of azeotropes which has recently 
been compiled is most convenient for at least initial studies of recover- 
ability (4). The question as to whether the solvent or the components 
which are separated by the extraction process should be the more volatile 
is an important one. In most extraction processes, the quantity of solvent 



92 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



used is greater than that of the desired products. If, in the recovery by 
distillation, the solvent is the more volatile, large quantities will be vapor- 
ized and the process will be costly. Therefore in such cases it is preferable 
that the solvent be the less volatile, and distillation will involve vaporiza- 
tion of the desired products which are present in smaller amounts- If the 
solvent is very selective, it is possible that very small amounts will be used, 
in which case it may be advantageous if the solvent is the more volatile. 
If the solute in the solvent-containing solution is nonvolatile, it may be 
necessary to recover the solvent by evaporation. In either case, if the 
solvent must be vaporized, its latent heat of vaporization should be low 
to reduce the cost of recovery.

The possibilities of using methods of solvent-product separation other 
than vaporization should not be overlooked. Crystallization of the product 
from the solvent solution and removal of the solute by adsorption are 
occasionally worth serious investigation. 

Density. A difference in densities of the contacted phases is essential 
and should be as great as possible. Not only is the rate of disengaging 
of the immiscible layers thereby enhanced, but also the capacity of the 
contacting equipment is increased. It is insufficient to examine merely 
the relative densities of the solution to be extracted and the pure extracting 
solvent, since on admixture mutual solubility of the two will alter the 
densities; for continuous contacting equipment, it is important to be certain 
that a satisfactory density difference for the contacted phases exists 



CHOICE OF SOLVENT 



throughout the entire range of the contemplated process. Figures 4.7 
and 4.8 indicate desirable and potentially undesirable situations respec- 
tively. In Fig. 4.7, the densities of saturated layers in the Type 1 system 
acetone-l,l,2-trichloroethane-water (acetone as distributed substance) 
are plotted, with equilibrium layers joined by tie lines (6). The densities 
of the water-rich layers are always less than those of trichloroethane-rich 
layers, but the change in density difference with acetone concentration is 
necessarily great, since at the plait point the densities of the conjugate 
solutions are identical. Figure 4.8 is the same sort of plot for the Type 2 
system methyl ethyl ketone-water-trichloroethylene (5) . Note that here a

reversal of sign in the density difference between equilibrium layers occurs, 
and while a stagewise contacting operation could work across the conjugate 
solutions of equal density, a continuous contacting operation could not. 

Interfacial Tension. The interfacial tension between immiscible phases 
which must be settled or disengaged should preferably be high for rapid 
action. Too high an interfacial tension on the other hand ~inay lead to 
difficulties in the adequate dispersion of one liquid in the otheiv white too 
low a value may lead to the formation of stable emulsions. Unfortunately, 
relatively few liquid interfacial-tension measurements for complete ternary 
systems have been made. As an extremely rough guide, the differences 
in the surface tensions with air of the contacted liquids may be used to 
estimate the order of magnitude of interfacial tension, but this will be at 



94 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

best a very crude indication. In Type 1 systems, the interfacial tension 
between equilibrium layers will fall to zero at the plait point. 

Chemical Reactivity. Chemical reactions between solvent and com- 
ponents of the solution yielding products extraneous to the process are 
undesirable, since only in their absence will the yield of products be high 
and complete solvent recovery be possible. On occasion, the formation 
of a chemical compound as part of the extraction process may be con- 
sidered desirable, since then the rate and even the extent of extraction 
may be enhanced. Ordinarily any such reaction product should be capa- 
ble of easy decomposition so that solvent recovery is possible, unless the 
reaction product itself is the desired substance. Polymerization, con- 
densation, or decomposition of the solvent at any temperature attained 
in the process, including the recovery equipment, is not desirable. 

Mutual Solubility with Solution to Be Extracted. The extracting solvent 
and solution to bo extracted should be highly immiscible. In a Type 1 




(cO (b) 

FIG. 4.9. Effect of solvent solubility on extraction. 

system, for example, this will ordinarily mean that high concentrations 
of distributed solute can be attained before complete solution of the immis- 
cible liquid occurs. This in turn increases the ultimate extent of separa- 
tion possible, as indicated in Fig. 4.9. In both of the systems shown, it is 
possible to use component B for separating solutions of A and C within 
the limits of pure A to M , since only in this range of concentration will 
immiscibility occur on addition of B. Clearly the possibilities with the 
system (a) are much greater than those with the system (6) . Furthermore, 
solvent recovery in highly insoluble systems is simpler, and, for a given 
distribution coefficient, the selectivity will be better [Eq. (4.4)]. 

Corrosiveness. In order to reduce the cost of equipment, the solvent 
should cause no severe corrosion difficulties with common materials of 
construction. Expensive alloys and other unusual materials should not 
be required. 



CHOICE OF SOLVENT 95 

Viscosity. Low power requirements for pumping, high heat-transfer 
rates, high rates of extraction, and general ease of handling are corollaries 
of low viscosity, and hence this is a desirable property of solvents in extrac- 
tion processes. 

Vapor Pressure. The vapor pressure of a proposed solvent should be 
sufficiently low so that storage and extraction operations are possible at 
atmospheric or at most only moderately high pressure. This requirement 
may of course conflict with the requirement of high relative volatility with 
the solution being extracted, and a compromise may be necessary. 

Freezing Point. The solvent should have a sufficiently low freezing 
point so that it may be conveniently stored and otherwise handled at out- 
door temperatures in cold weather. 

Inflammability. Low inflammability is of course desirable for reasons 
of safety, and the flash point is frequently used as a numerical indication 
of the property. If the solvent can be burned, it should have a high flash 
point and close concentration limits for explosive mixtures with air. 

Toxicity. Highly poisonous materials are difficult to handle industrially. 
Unless elaborate plant safety devices are planned, with frequent medical 
inspection of personnel, the more toxic substances must be avoided. 

Cost. Low cost and ready availability in adequate quantities usually 
parallel each other and are of course desirable solvent attributes. While 
it is true that solvents are recovered from product solutions, nevertheless 
make-up solvent to replace inevitable process losses must be expected. 
Furthermore, large quantities of expensive solvent which are retained in 
the plant represent sizable sums invested. Interest on such money is 
chargeable directly to the process. 

Of all the desirable properties described, favorable selectivity, recover- 
ability, interfacial tension, density, and chemical reactivity are essential 
for the process even to be carried out. The remaining properties, while 
not necessary from the technical point of view, must be given consideration 
in good engineering work and in cost estimation.

CHAPTER 5 
DIFFUSION AND MASS TRANSFER 

Consider a liquid flowing through a pipe. Extensive study of the 
velocity distribution in such a fluid has revealed that at the pipe wall the fluid 
is motionless and that at increasing distances from the pipe wall the 
fluid velocity gradually increases, reaching a maximum value at the center. 
Near the pipe wall the flow is viscous or laminar, characterized by a velocity 
which is a linear function of the distance from the pipe wall, with no general 
mixing in the direction of the pipe radius. If the average velocity is 
sufficiently large, laminar flow is confined to a relatively thin layer adjacent 
to the pipe wall. In the central core of the fluid, flow is turbulent, charac- 
terized by eddy currents with large velocity components perpendicular 
to the axis of the pipe and considerable mixing of the fluid in the direction 
of the pipe radius. Similar phenomena are observed whenever fluids move 
rapidly past solid boundaries of any sort and also when the boundary is an 
interface between two immiscible fluids, although in the latter case the rela- 
tive interfacial velocity in the two phases and not the absolute velocity 
is zero. 

In extraction processes, where moving immiscible liquids are brought 
into contact for the purpose of causing the diffusion of a substance from 
one liquid to the other across the phase boundary, it is clear that the diffus- 
ing substance must pass through various portions of the fluid that are in 
viscous or turbulent flow. The rates at which the diffusion occurs through 
these zones are of major importance in determining the size of equipment 
for carrying out the extraction. 

MOLECULAR DIFFUSION 

Molecular diffusion is the mechanism of transfer of a substance either 
through a fluid which is motionless~or, if the ffuTcTis in laminar flow, in a 
direction perpendicular to the velocity of the fluid. The phenomenon 
has been studied from many points of view7frequently conflicting, the most 
important of which are those of Fick and of Maxwell-Stefan. Fick (7) 
applied the well-known Fourier equation for rate of heat flow to the problem 
of diffusion. Unfortunately the mechanism of the two processes is not 
identical, since in the penetration of a liquid by a diffusing solute there will 
necessarily be displacement of the liquid and consequent volume changes 
arising for which the Fourier equation does not account. As an approxi- 

97 



98 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

mation, however, the Fick concept is very useful, particularly since the 
Fourier equation has been integrated for many situations which parallel 
problems in diffusion. Maxwell (17) and later Stefan (27) considered 
the simultaneous movement of both components of the solution through 
which the solute is diffusing and arrived at equations which are much 
more general. These have been reviewed and extended by Lewis and 
Chang (15), Sherwood (24), and Arnold (2). 

Maxwell-Stefan Concept. In substance, the resistance to diffusion of 
component A through a solution of A and B is assumed to be proportional 
to the relative velocity of A with respect to B, U A UB', to the distance dl 
through which the diffusion occurs; and to the number of molecules of A 
and B in the path of the diffusion, in turn proportional to the concentra- 
tions CA and CB- The resistance must be overcome by a concentration 
gradient in the direction of diffusion dcA- Thus, 

dCA ~"bCACB(UA Us)dl (5.1) 

This basic equation may then be integrated for various situations. 

1. Equimolal Counterdiffusion. This leads to Pick's law. If NA and 
NB are the number of moles of A and B, respectively, diffusing per unit 
time through a cross section S, 

N A = c A u A S, N B = c B u B S (5.2) 

and 

N A =-NB (5.3) 

Substitution in Eq. (5.1) then leads to 

N A =- b , ^ . ~j (5.4) 

The diffusion coefficient, or diffusivity D is defined as 

D * - ^TT^j' (5 - 5) 

whence 

NtDJ** (5.6) 

which is Pick's law. 

2. Steady-state Conditions (N A = constant), One Component Stationary 
or Not Diffusing (UB = 0). Equation (5.1) then becomes 

. dc A =- bNACsdl = - N A c B dl . (5 g) 

Integration of Eq. (5.8) then depends upon the effect of concentration on 
the volume of the liquid solution and upon D.

3. Unsteady-state Conditions. Arnold (2) has integrated the Maxwell- 
Stefan equation for gaseous diffusion in the case of the " semi-infinite 
column/' or diffusion from a plane at which the concentrations are kept 
constant into a space filled with gas extending to infinity, both for vapori- 
zation of a liquid into a gas and absorption of a gas by a liquid. It is 
possible that the resulting equations could be applied successfully to liquid 
diffusion for similar circumstances, provided that an assumption analogous 
to Dalton's law for gases can be made and that D is assumed to remain 
constant. The direct application to extraction operations of such equa- 



DIFFUSION AND MASS TRANSFER 101 

tions is unlikely, but it could be useful in the experimental determination 
of the diffusivity. 

There is perhaps more direct application for an integration of the diffu- 
sion equation for unsteady-state diffusion from spheres, since frequently 
extraction operations involve the dispersion of one liquid in the form of 
more or less spherical drops into another immiscible liquid. Isolated 
drops rising or falling through the continuous liquid will undergo unsteady- 
state extraction of their solute. Newman (21) presents the integration 
of the Fick equation for this case, for a sphere with an initial uniform 
concentration of solute c, a constant surface concentration CAI, and a 
radius r. The fraction unextracted at any time 0, when the final average 
concentration is WA, is given by 



W A - CAI _ 6/ 
- - \c 



(5.27) 



Numerical solutions of the equation are given by Newman. 

Experimental Determination of Diffusivity. Reviews of the various 
methods of determining D are given by Williams and Cady (33) and Cohen 
and Bruins (3). Two general techniques are used: (a) those in which 
average concentrations are determined in different zones of a liquid by 
sampling and analysis after diffusion of a solute into the various zones 
has occurred, and (6) those in which the course of the diffusion is followed 
without disturbing the liquid, using optical or similar means of analysis. 
Aside from the obvious requirements of constant temperature and absence 
of vibration and eddy currents, the various experimental techniques require 
means of obtaining a sharp demarcation between the dilute and concen- 
trated solutions at the beginning of the experiment. Cohen and Bruins 
(3) and others accomplished this by placing several plates in contact with 
each other, each with a hole bored through it. These were so arranged 
that by rotating the plates the holes would line up to form a diffusion 
column. A concentrated solution in the hole of one plate could then be 
rotated into contact with solvent in the other holes with a minimum of 
disturbance. At the end of the experiment, rotating the plates would 
effectively slice samples from the diffusion column without disturbance 
of the liquid. McBain and Liu (18) and others have used a porous, sin- 
tered, glass membrane to separate the concentrated and dilute solutions, 
with the concentration gradient and diffusion confined to the pores of the 
membrane. Gels have frequently been used to keep the solutions free 
of eddy currents and to facilitate the clean slicing of samples, but it is 
doubtful whether the rate of diffusion through a gel is the same as through 
a solution. The data resulting from these experiments have almost invari- 
ably been converted to diffusivities by application of several integrated 
f onri&amp; of Pick's law. Since the diffusivities in liquid solutions are functions 



102 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

of concentration, unless the concentration gradient hasJ^een kept small the 
resulting diffusivities are average values over the range of concentration 
encountered, rather than " instantaneous " values. Many data are tabu- 
lated in the " International Critical Tables" (Vol. V, pp. 63-75). 

Empirical Estimation of Diffusivities for Nonelectrolytes. Dilute Solu- 
tions. Two reasonably successful approaches have been made to the prob- 
lem of estimation of diffusivities in the absence of measured data, based 
on an extension of the kinetic theory to liquids and on the theory of absolute 
reaction rates. 

1. Kinetic theory approach. By application of the kinetic theory of 
gases to the liquid phase, Arnold (1) obtained an expression of D paralleling 
in form that obtained previously for gases:

Values of V can be obtained conveniently from Kopp's law, which 
states that V is an additive function of the atomic volumes of the constit- 
uents of a molecule. The contributions of each atom given by Le Bas are 
used by Arnold, and these are listed in Table 5.1. For complex molecules, 
these are then added together. Thus, for toluene CyHs, V = 7(14.8) + 
8(3.7) 15 = 118.2. For the smaller molecules such as those of the gases, 
the table lists directly the values to be used. The abnormality factors 
A A and AB are corrections included in the equation to account for " associ- 
ation," or unduly large intermolecular attraction. Values of AB are strictly 
functions of the solvent, paralleling in numerical magnitude the association 
factors obtained from other anomalous properties of liquids, and are listed

It is an observed fact that the larger the value of Z), the less is its tempera-

Figure 5.1 compares some observed values of D with those calculated 
by the Arnold correlation. 

2. Absolute-rate-theory Approach. Eyring and others (6, 8, 14, 23, 29) 
have extended the theory of absolute rates to the problem of liquid diffusion 
and viscosity with considerable success. Viscosity is a measure of the force 
per unit area required to overcome the frictional resistance between two 
layers of molecules of a liquid in maintaining unit relative velocity of the 
two layers. In diffusion, molecules of the diffusing solute move past those 



DIFFUSION AND MASS TRANSFER

of the solvent, and a force must be applied to maintain their velocity. 
The phenomena are thus closely related.

FIG. 5.1. Companson of observed difTusivities with those calculated by the method of 
Arnold (1). 

In the Eyring concept, a liquid is regarded as being made up of a con- 
tinuum of matter interspersed with holes. The same energy is required 
to make a hole in the liquid the size of a molecule as the energy of vapori- 
zation per molecule. Thus, per mole, 

A#F = A# F - RT (5.31) 

where &amp;Ev = energy to make a hole 
AHy = enthalpy of vaporization 

RT = external work of vaporization for an ideal gas 
Movement of one layer of a liquid relative to another requires the move- 
ment of molecules from one equilibrium position to another, for which it is 
necessary that a hole be available. This in turn requires expenditure of 
energy to make the hole. This concept leads to the relationship 

XtkT 



X 2 A 3 A 2 A;' 



(5.32) 



106 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

where Xi = distance between two layers of molecules 

X 2 = distance between adjacent molecules in the direction of move- 

ment 
X 3 = average distance between adjacent molecules in a direction 

perpendicular to the movement 
X = distance between equilibrium positions in the direction of 

movement 

k = Boltzmann const. 
k r specific rate const. 
Application of the theory of absolute rates then leads to 

M = k"c E "* /RT (5.33) 

where k" = a constant including the molar volume, energy of vaporization, 

and temperature 

E v ia = energy of activation for viscous flow 

k" is fairly independent of temperature, and hence a plot of log n vs. l/T 
will result in a reasonably good straight line for most liquids, the slope 
of which will permit determination of E vls . It has been found that 

tf vb = AEv - (5.34) 

fli 

where n = a number, between 3 and 4 for most unassociated liquids, but 
for highly associated liquids such as water it is somewhat lower and varies 
with temperature. This indicates that the hole-size required for the 
movement of a molecule is only J^ to Y that of the molecule itself. 

Diffusion, as indicated above, is a related problem, differing however 
in the fact that molecules of different sizes are involved. Many years ago, 
Einstein (5), in considering' the Brownian movement of colloids where the 
particles are very large in comparison to the molecules of the solvent and 
assuming that Stokes' law described the motion of the particles, arrived at 
what is known as the Stokes-Einstein equation: 



This relation has been found inadequate to describe ordinary diffusion data 
perfectly, since the Stokes' law assumption that the liquid through which 
the diffusing molecules move is continuous is inapplicable when the mole- 
cules of the diffusing solute actually approach those of the solvent in size. 
Application of the Eyring "hole" theory for ideal liquids leads to 

D A = X 2 fc' (5.36) 

and on the assumption that X and fc' for diffusion and viscosity are the same, 

(5.37) 



DIFFUSION AND MASS TRANSFER 107 

which parallels in form the Stokes-Einstein equation. Clearly the quantity 
Xi/X2X 8 is related to the molar volume, and hence the product DM should be 
a function of the molar volume of the system. Furthermore, it is known 
that the temperature coefficient for the diffusion of large molecules is the 
same as the temperature coefficient of viscosity of the solvent, indicating 
that the Stokes-Einstein equation is a limiting case of Eq. (5.37). This 
is interpreted as meaning that in the case of large diffusing molecules the 
rate is determined by a jump of the solvent molecule from one equilibrium 
position to another, followed by movement of the diffusing molecule into 
the space thus made available. 

The theory of absolute rates, when applied to the rate constant k', then 
leads to 

D A = k'"e- E W RT (5.38) 

where k'" a constant including X, k, temp., and the free vol. of the liquid 

^dw = energy of activation for diffusion 

Since k"' is substantially independent of temperature, a plot of log Dvs.l/T 
results in reasonably good straight lines. 

Because of the similarity of the diffusion and viscosity phenomena, the 
energies of activation of the two processes are apparently the same, so that 

E Mtt = E via = (5.39) 



and -Bdifl can thus be calculated either from latent heats of vaporization or 
from the temperature dependency of viscosity. Since two unlike mole- 
cules are involved, it has been found that &amp;E V should be calculated from the 
values for the pure constituents by the relationship 

&amp;E V = (X A *E$ A + X B AE^) 2 (5.40) 

Thus, by a combination of Eqs. (5.38), (5.39), and (5.40), a single deter- 
mination of D permits estimates of the constant k" f and hence the tem- 
perature dependency of D. 

Direct application of Eq. (5.38) by determination of fc'" from its con- 
stituent constants leads to values of D which are too large, differing from 
the observed values by a factor frequently larger than 2. Wilke (32) has 
employed an empirical modification, however, which permits much closer 
estimates of D. Rearranging Eq. (5.37) to read

Wilke found that F for a given solvent correlated well as a function of the 
molal volume of the solute. The effect of different solvents is expressed 
through a parameter &lt;f&gt; which at values of solute molal volumes less than 
150 cu. cm./gm. mole equals the ratio of F for the solvent to F for water at 
constant molal volume of solute. Furthermore, F for a given solution is

Values of &lt;t&gt; for water, methanol, and benzene are 1.0, 0.82, and 0.70, respec- 
tively. Values of &lt;t&gt; for other solvents may be obtained by plotting all 
available data for diffusion in the solvent on the figure and drawing the 
best line through the plotted points. In the absence of such data, it is 
recommended that &lt; be taken as 0.9. Figure 5.3 compares observed data 
with those calculated by the Wilke method. 

Concentrated Solutions. Powell, Roseveare, and Eyring (23) have shown 
that in concentrated, nonideal solutions, the diffusivity will be a function 
of the activity of the solute in the solution:

slopes which are equal but opposite in sign. Accordingly, in Fig. 5.5, the viscosity

The Z) for mannitol at 20C. was plotted (the cross symbol in the figure), and a curve

Diffusivities of Electrolytes. Dilute Solutions. The diffusion of an 
electrolyte is complicated by the dissociation of the molecule into ions. 
Conductivity measurements indicate that the various ions have different 
mobilities, and consequently it might be assumed that the various ions 
might diffuse at different rates. This would lead, however, to high local 
concentrations of positively and negatively charged ions, and the elec- 
trostatic forces resulting would slow down the fast ions and speed up the 
slow. As a result, the ions actually diffuse at equal speeds, and the solu- 
tion remains electrically neutral. Since the ions are smaller than the undis- 
sociated molecules, they diffuse at greater rates. 

For complete dissociation, Nernst (20) showed that at infinite dilution 
the diffusivity of an electrolyte is related to the ionic mobilities in the fol- 
lowing manner: 

Ddo = u++ + U~ (^ + V (5&lt;45)

Concentrated Solutions. For concentrated solutions, corrections involv- 
ing activity coefficients and the effect of concentration on the ion mobilities 
must be included :

where m = molality of the solution 

7 = mean ionic activity coefficients referred to molality 
/(m) = a correction for effect of concentration on ionic mobilities 
At low concentrations, the activity-coefficient term is by far the more 
important of the corrections. Attempts to evaluate /(m) from theoretical 
principles are reviewed in detail by Harned (10) and Harned and Owen 
(11), who show that they have not been particularly useful at high con- 
centrations. Gordon (9) has had considerable success using an empirical 
evaluation, however: 

/(m)= 1 wt (5i47)

meters per gram mole 

CB = the number of gram moles of water per cu. cm. of solution 
fjiB = viscosity of water 
fj, viscosity of the solution 

This approximation is particularly good in the case of electrolytes dissociat- 
ing into two univalent ions but less successful for those of higher valences.

NaCl in solution, calories/gm. mole. Values of LA are listed by Lewis and Randall 
("Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances," p. 92, McGraw-Hill 
Book Company, Inc., New York, 1923). The term [1 + (ma In y/dm)] is evaluated as 
[1 + (d log y/d log m)] by plotting log y against log m and determining the slopes of 
the resulting curve at various values of m. Differentiation of empirical expressions for 
7 as a function of m is another method of obtaining this quantity. 

Values of CB for various molalities were calculated from density data of " Chemical 
Engineers' Handbook" (McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York, 1950). Partial 
molal volumes VB were calculated from these density data by the method of tangent 
intercepts described by Lewis and Randall (loc. cit., p. 39). Relative viscosities M/MB are 
available for NaCl solutions at 18C. in "International Critical Tables" (Vol. V, p. 15).

Figure 5.7 shows the results of other calculations of the same type, 
compared with reported data for concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 

normal, where the correction /(m) is 
practically equal to unity, and tem- 
peratures ranging from 10 to 18C. 
Each plotted point represents a dif- 
ferent electrolyte. At these concen- 
trations agreement between observed 
and calculated results are obviously 
excellent. 

These methods cannot be employed 
for weak electrolytes, where the prop- 
erties of the solution cannot be ap- 
proximated from the properties of the 
individual ions. The presence of large 
concentrations of undissociated mole- 
cules which diffuse at a slower rate 
than the ions prevents direct application of the methods described, and no 
satisfactory substitute is as yet available. 

EDDY DIFFUSION 

The transfer of matter through a fluid flowing in turbulent flow is a 
much more complicated process than molecular diffusion, and its analysis 
depends primarily upon our understanding of the flow phenomenon. In 
turbulent flow, eddies exist within the body of the fluid which carry with 
them any dissolved solute in bulk. Since the velocities of the eddies are 
great in comparison to the * velocities of molecular diffusion, it is to be 
expected that eddy diffusion, or the transfer of the solute under such condi- 
tions, is much the more rapid process. 

As Dryden (4) emphasizes, turbulence is a lack of uniformity in the 
flow conditions, characterized by'S'irFegularflu^tuation of the flwdlreToc- 
ity at any point from instant to instant. Two factors are ordinarily re- 
quired to express the degree of turbulence in quantitative fashion, the 
intensity and the scale. Intensity is defined as the root-mean-square 
fluctuation of velocity at any^ point. The scale relates the fluctuations at 
different points within the fluid at the same instant and has been quanti- 
tatively defined by Taylor (28) as the area under a curve of the correlation 
between the velocity fluctuation at two points taken perpendicular to the 
line joining the points plotted against the distance between the points. 
The scale may be taken as the size of an eddy. 

Provided that the distances considered are large in comparison to the 
scale, or eddy size, the rate of eddy diffusion should be proportional to the 
concentration gradient. On this basis, Sherwood and others (13, 25, 26) 



DIFFUSION AND MASS TRANSFER 117 

have been successful in treating eddy diffusion in terms of an eddy dif- 
fusivity E defined in a manner analogous to Pick's law for molecular diffu- 
sion: 

N A = -8*8^ (5.48) 

Sherwood's work with eddy diffusion in gases (26, 30) has shown that the 
eddy Hiffiiaivity fc pnnsttmf. nvp&gt;r tl^n central core of a gas stream in tur- 
bulent flow and, as was to be expected, is not only much larger numerically 
than the molecular diffusivity (of the order of 100 times as great as the 
gaseous D) but also independent, of the molecular weight of the diffusing 
substance except in s'o7aFas~th3 turbulence of the stream is thereby affected. 
Kalinske and Pien"(l3), working with the eddy diffusion of HC1 in liquid 
water, obtained values of E of the order of 10 12 times as great as the molecu- 
lar diffusivity in liquid water. 

Since the transfer of the diffusing solute is a bulk transfer rather than the 
slow, molecular diffusion, the nature of the eddying and the velocity gradi- 
ent in the fluid should provide a means of estimating the eddy diffusivity 
Thus, if viscosity is defined by the following equation for laminar flow: 

T = M| (5.49) 

where r = the shearing stress 

dv/dl = the velocity gradient in the fluid 
then by analogy an eddy viscosity e for turbulent flow can be defined (19) as 

r = (M + i) I (5.50) 

and should be obtainable from measurements of velocity gradients. 
By analogy to a similar treatment for heat transfer (4, 19, 26) it can further 
be shown that E should equal e/p. In the case of certain gaseous diffusion 
experiments (26), E = 1.6 (e/p), while in the eddy diffusion of HC1 in 
liquid water (13) where the velocity gradient could not be measured ac- 
curately, it is reported that values of E compared well with those of e/p. 
Much work remains to be done before eddy diffusivities can be calculated 
with confidence. 

MASS-TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS 

The complete diffusion process ordinarily occurs through successive 
regions of a fluid in laminar and turbulent flow. It is to be expected that 
in the laminar-flow region the rate of diffusion would be proportional to D, 
while in the turbulent region proportional to E. In the region between 
those strictly in laminar and turbulent flow, the nature of the change from 
laminar flow to turbulence is obviously of importance. The Prandtl- 
Taylor concept of a strictly laminar film with a well-defined boundary 



118 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

separating it from the turbulent region has been shown to be incorrect, 
and there exists instead a gradual change from one condition to the other. 
Many attempts to account for this change have been made, and an excellent 
review of the developments as they apply to diffusion problems is provided 
by Sherwood (25). In view of our relative lack of knowledge concerning 
the eddy-diffusion process, it seems best at present to describe the rate of 
diffusion by expressions paralleling those for molecular diffusion, and at- 
tempt to include the effects of both phenomena by use of a fictitious laminar 
film whose thickness, the "effective" film thickness, is sufficient to account 
for the total resistance to mass transfer. Thus, Eqs. (5.22) and (5.24) 
become

where 1 is the effective film thickness for combined molecular and eddy dif- 
fusion. Equation (5.51) may be simplified by introducing a mass-transfer 
film coefficient k as follows: 

k = -^, (5.52a)

and 

N A = kS(c Al - CA,) = kSc(x Al - x At ) (5.526) 

Two-film Concept. Let us now apply this concept to a typical transfer 
of a solute from one liquid to another nonconsolute liquid in contact with 
it, under steady-state conditions. Assuming both liquids to be in motion 
in a general direction parallel to the interface between them, there will exist 
concentration gradients in both phases which act as driving forces for the 
transfer, and the resistance to diffusion can be represented by an effec- 
tive film thickness for each phase. This picture of the complete mass- 
transfer process was first introduced by Whitman (16, 31), who also postu- 
lated that at the interface itself equilibrium would be established. The 
concentrations in each phase on either side of the interface and immediately 
in contact with it would be such that they correspond to an indefinitely 
long time of contact. There is no direct evidence to prove the latter con- 
cept; indeed there have been a few experiments reported indicating the 
contrary (12). Nevertheless the general conclusions based on the assump- 
tion appear to be valid. 

Figure 5.8 indicates graphically the situation just described. Here 
concentration of the diffusing substance is plotted as a function of the 
distance through the two-phase system. The interfacial surface between 
the liquids is imagined to be in a plane perpendicular to that of the paper 
and is thus seen only as a line. The two liquid phases are designated as E 
and R, and the subscripts on the concentration terms c refer to the various 
positions in the system, i for interface, E and R for the main portion

of the corresponding phases. It is understood that only concentrations 
of the distributed, diffusing substance are being considered. In the R 
phase, CR is the average, main-body concentration of diffusing substance 
such as would be obtained by analyz- 
ing a sample of the mixed liquid. By 
virtue of the concentration gradient 
CR c#t, the diffusing substance is 
transferred through the eddy- and 
laminar-flow portions of the R phase 
to the interface, the equivalent molecu- 
lar diffusional resistance for which is 
represented by the effective film thick-

pertain at the interface, so that CE% is 
in equilibrium with CR IJ the relation- 
ship between them given by the equi- 
librium-distribution curve for the sys- 
tem. There is consequently no diffu- 
sional resistance at the interface, and 
the diffusing substance passes into the 
E phase. The concentration gradient 
CE\ CE then provides the driving force 
for diffusion into the main body of the 
E phase, where the average concentration is CE&gt; The equivalent molecular 
diffusional resistance is represented by the effective film thickness 1# . 

It might at first be thought that the concentration difference CEI CR 
would represent a barrier or a concentration gradient operating in a direc- 
tion such as to oppose the forward movement of the diffusing substance. 
It should be recalled, however, that if all portions of the two phases were in 
equilibrium, so that the concentrations of the distributed substance were 
represented by horizontal lines at CRi in the R phase and CE* in the E phase, 
the concentration difference CEI CR{ would still exist, and yet there would 
be no net diffusion from E to R. The apparent concentration barrier would 
disappear if activities were used rather than concentrations, and the driving 
forces of Fig. 5.8 would be represented by a continuous drop as we moved 
from R to E. 

It is instructive to plot the concentrations on a distribution diagram, as 
in Fig. 5.9. The equilibrium-distribution curve will contain the point 
(cEi,CRi), and the point represented by main-body concentrations (CE,CR) 
will be below the equilibrium curve. The driving-force concentration 
gradients for each phase are indicated as ACE and Ac#, respectively. In 
applying Eq. (5.526), let us consider the differential rate of transfer dN 
which will occur through differential interfacial surface dS. Further, 



120 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



since the thickness of the fictitious film through which most of the concen- 
tration gradient occurs is very small, so that the solute content of the 
films is negligible with respect to the total solute present, under steady-state 
conditions the rate of transfer of solute through the E phase equals that 
through the R phase. Consequently,

We may then represent the complete transfer process in both phases in the 
following manner: 

dN = KB dS(c* E - CR) = K B dS &amp;COE (5.57) 

where KB is an over-all mass-transfer coefficient based on an over-all 
concentration gradient AC O E in the E phase. Similarly CR is defined as a 
concentration in equilibrium with c^, 

C E = mcl (5.58) 

dN = K R dS(c R - 4) = K R dS ACOR (5.59) 

where KR is an over-all mass-transfer coefficient based on an over-all con-

ing substance strongly favors the E phase, m will be very large; provided 
k E and k R are of comparable order of magnitude, K R will nearly equal k Rj 
and we may conclude that the principal resistance to diffusion lies in the 
R phase. Graphical interpretation of such a situation is shown in Fig. 5.10,

where Aco is very nearly equal to Ac#. In such instances Eq. (5.59) is 
ordinarily used to describe the operations. Similarly if m is very small 
and the distributed substance favors the 12 phase, KB will nearly equal 
A^, the resistance in the J5-phase controls, and Eq. (5.57) is used. Figure 
5.11 represents this situation. 



122 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

In continuously operating extraction processes, each phase undergoes 
wide concentration changes as it flows through the equipment. The point 
on the concentration diagrams whose coordinates are (CR,CE) therefore 
represents only one position in such equipment, and the rate equations 
(Eqs. (5.53), (5.57), and (5.59)) are "instantaneous," or point conditions. 
In applying them to actual operations, therefore, they will have to be inte- 
grated over the concentration range which the liquids experience. Clearly 
if the simple distribution law, Eq. (5.55), is not applicable, wide variation 
with concentration of the over-all coefficients KE and K R can be expected 
even if k E and /c# remain constant. Since the factors upon which ks and

CHAPTER 6 

METHODS OF CALCULATION I. STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH 

A SINGLE SOLVENT 

The separation of the components of a solution by extraction may be 
brought about in a number of ways, depending upon the nature of the sol- 
vent system and the physical arrangement of the apparatus employed. A 
convenient classification is the following: 

1. Single solvent systems, including all those which consist of, or which 
may be reduced to the equivalent of, three components: the two to be 
separated, and the solvent. 

a. Stagewise contact. In this category are included those arrange- 
ments of equipment where solvent and mixture to be separated are 
intimately contacted, allowed to approach equilibrium, and sep- 
arated. The operation may then be repeated and with a variety 
of flowsheets. 

b. Continuous contact. This includes arrangements where solvent 
and mixture to be separated are continuously in contact within the 
equipment for the entire operation. Equilibrium is not ordinarily 
approached. 

2. Mixed solvents. This includes those arrangements employing a sol- 
vent solution consisting of at least two components, where the sol- 
ubility relationships are such that simplification to the equivalent of a 
ternary system is not feasible. 

a. Stagewise contact. 

b. Continuous contact. 

3. Double solvents (fractional extraction). This category includes those 
arrangements where the mixture to be separated is distributed be- 
tween two immiscible solvents. The systems contain at least four 
components. 

a. Stagewise contact. 

b. Continuous contact. 

In this chapter only Stagewise contact with single solvents is considered. 

Distillation Analogy. In studying the various processes of extraction, 
it is frequently helpful to keep in mind the parallel processes of distillation, 
which are generally more familiar. The analogy between the two methods 
of separation has been pointed out by several writers (13, 14). In distilla- 
tion processes, a mixture of two substances is separated by creation of two 

125 



126 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

phases, one liquid and one vapor, by the addition of heat, and the separa- 
tion is brought about by virtue of the fact that the relative concentration 
of the substances is different in the two phases. Subsequent condensation 
of the vapor phase is brought about by removal of heat. In extraction, 
two liquid phases are formed by the addition of an immiscible solvent, 
which then becomes the analog of heat. Since the relative concentration 
of the substances to be separated is different in the two phases, physical 
settling of the liquid layers produces the desired degree of separation. Re- 
moval of solvent from the solvent-rich phase is then analogous to condensa- 
tion of the vapor in the case of distillation. Table 6.1 indicates the analo- 
gous situations.

Definitions. A stage is a ihechanical device or series of devices wherein 
the solution to be separated and an immiscible solvent are intimately mixed, 
allowed to approach equilibrium, and then settled or separated into two 
immiscible liquid phases which are then withdrawn. The solvent-rich 
phase leaving the stage is termed the extract, the solvent-lean phase the

raffinate. A theoretical or ideal stage is one where contact between phases 
is sufficiently intimate and maintained for a sufficient period of time that 
distribution equilibrium is established, so that raffinate and extract are 
equilibrium solutions. Although there are many varieties and combina- 
tions of mixers and settlers used for this purpose, in this chapter the ideal 
stage will be designated diagrammatically by a circular figure, as in Fig. 6.1. 



STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH A SINGLE SOLVENT 127 

Design Diagrams. The interrelationship among the phase equilibria, 
number of stages, and concentrations and weights of various streams in an 
extraction process can best be worked out graphically on a diagram show- 
ing the phase equilibria. Many types of diagrams can be used, and cer- 
tain coordinate systems are more convenient than others, depending upon 
the nature of the phase equilibria and the process. Three types will be 
considered here : 

1. Triangular Coordinates. Customarily, ternary-phase-equilibrium 
data are described in the literature on triangular diagrams, and since they 
are capable of depicting all concentration characteristics of such systems, 
they are most useful. The general properties of these coordinates are 
described in Chap. 2, to which reference should now be made. In connec- 
tion with the use of such diagrams in this chapter, the following scheme of 
notation will be applied : 

A, B, and C will represent the three pure components of the ternary 
system. A and C are the principal components of the solution to be 
separated, B the pure extracting solvent. In Type 1 ternary systems, A 
and B are partially miscible; in Type 2 systems, the pairs A-B and B-C are 
partially miscible. The symbols will also represent the weight of these 
components. Thus, A will mean A pounds of component A } B will mean 
B pounds of component #, etc. F, E, and R will designate feed, extract, 
and raffinate solutions, respectively, both with respect to weight and com- 
position. Thus, the symbol F will represent F pounds of a feed solution of 
composition indicated by point F on the triangular diagram. Other solu- 
tions and mixtures will be designated by appropriate symbols, in each case 
the symbol representing not only the weight but also the composition as 
indicated on the phase diagram. Weight fraction compositions will be 
designated by X with appropriate subscripts as described in Chap. 2. Thus, 
XAB = weight fraction of A in a J5-rich solution, XCE = weight fraction of 
C in the extract, XBF = weight fraction of B in the feed, etc. It should be 
noted that moles and mole fractions may be substituted throughout for 
weights and weight fractions, if desired. 

Stages are numbered, and when these numbers are used as subscripts they 
ordinarily indicate streams issuing from the indicated stage. Thus, 
XcR t = weight fraction of C in the raffinate from stage 2. R n = weight of 
raffinate from the nth stage, etc. 

The length of a line on a phase diagram between two points and P will 
be represented by OP, as in Fig. 6.2a. A mixture at 0, when added to one 
at P, results in a new mixture at K on the straight line OP, such that 



Similarly, removing P from K yields on the line PK extended. Tie lines 
will be shown lighter in weight than other construction lines.

2. Janecke Diagram. This system of coordinates, described in Chap. 2, 
involves plotting X, the weight fraction of C on a 5-free basis as abscissa 
against N, the weight of B per unit weight of B-f ree solution as ordinate, as 
in Fig. 6.26. Thus,

As in the case of triangular diagrams, the symbols E, A, R, etc. will repre- 
sent both weight and composition as indicated on the diagram of liquids E, 
A, and R. Boldface symbols will represent the 5-free weights of the desig- 
nated streams. Thus, R 2 represents the combined weight of A and C in 
the raffinate from stage 2. The total and jB-free weights of a stream P are 
related in the following manner: 

(6.3) 



(6.4) 



P = P(l + N P ) 
The weight of B in the solution P will be 



B P = PN 



The length of the line between points and P will be indicated by OP and, 
as in the case of imnjsul.'U 1 coordinates, moles and mole fractions may be 
used in place of weights and weight fractions. 

On the Janecke diagram, as on triangular coordinates, if a mixture at 
is added to one at P, the resulting mixture K will be on the straight line 
OP, and the weights are in the following relationship: 



O

KP

(6.5) 



Likewise, removing P from K results in on the line PK extended. Tie 
lines and construction lines will be shown light and heavy, respectively. 



STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH A SINGLE SOLVENT 129 

3. Simple Distribution Diagram. On these coordinates XCA is plotted 
as abscissa against XCB as ordinate, as in Fig. 6.2c. Modification of these 
coordinates, in cases where the liquids A and B may be considered sub- 
stantially insoluble, will be described as they are needed. 

Calculations may ordinarily be worked out on any of these diagrams, but 
for certain systems, because of overcrowding of the phase relationships in a 
given region of the plot, one or the other of the diagrams may not be con- 
venient for graphical computation. It is therefore desirable to be familiar 
with the use of all. Properties of the diagrams other than those used here, 
the complete interrelationship between them, and other useful coordinate 
systems are described at length in a series of articles by Randall and 
Longtin (13). 

Flowsheet Arrangements. Stagewise single-solvent extraction can be 
brought about in several fashions, depending upon the arrangement of the 
stages, each yielding different results. Thus, we have 

1. Single contact. This involves the use of a single stage, where solution 
to be separated and extracting solvent are contacted once and extract and 
raffinate phases separated. Operation may be batchwise or continuous. 
The distillation analog is flash vaporization or equilibrium distillation. 

2. Differential extraction. This is a batch operation wherein a definite 
amount of solution to be extracted is contacted with differential portions 
of extracting solvent, the differential portions of extract being removed as 
fast as formed. The operation is exactly analogous to differential distilla- 
tion and has been termed "cocurrent infinite stage" by Varteressian and 
Fenske (22). 

3. Cocurrent multiple contact. This may be batch or continuous and is 
an extension of the single contact wherein the raffinate is contacted re- 
peatedly with fresh extracting solvent. In the limit represented by an 
infinite number of stages, this becomes the same as differential extraction. 

4. Countercurrent multiple contact. This method involves the use of a 
cascade of stages, extracting solvent and solution to be extracted entering 
at opposite ends of the cascade. Extracts and raffinates flow counter- 
currently. The operation is more analogous to gas absorption than to 
any distillation practice. It is necessarily continuous but may be simulated 
in batch fashion, in the laboratory for example, as "pseudo countercurrent 
multiple contact. " 

5. Countercurrent multiple contact with reflux. This is a continuous 
operation annlogoii^ to fractional distillation. A cascade of stages is em- 
ployed, with feed solution to be separated customarily entering somewhere 
in the middle of the cascade and extracting solvent at one end. Extract and 
raffinate phases flow countercurrently, with reflux provided at both ends of 
the cascade. Alternatively, reflux may be used only at one end of the cas- 
cade, corresponding to the enriching or stripping practices of distillation.

Triangular Coordinates. The flowsheet, with indicated weights of the 
various streams, is shown in Fig. 6.3a (22). While ordinarily the solution to 
be extracted consists solely of a mixture of A and C, and the extracting 
solvent is pure B, in the general case all three components will be present in

these streams, as indicated by the positions of the points F and S on Fig. 
6.36. Here the curve RDEG is a typical binodal-solubility curve of a 
Type 1 system, enclosing an area of two liquid phases. A material balance 
for the operation is 

F + S = R + E = M (6.6) 

M , representing the mixture of feed and solvent, is in the two-liquid-phase 
region, as indicated on the diagram. Its location can be determined 
graphically on the line FS through the relationship 

f= *"&gt; 

&amp; PM 

or analytically by calculating its composition by material balances. Thus, 
a C balance is

Equations (6.9) and (6.10) will locate point M . Alternatively, to deter- 
mine the quantity of solvent needed for a given feed in order to produce a 
predetermined Af, Eq. (6.10) may be solved for S: 



S = *-*:"* " B " (6.11) 

**BS **BM 



STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH A SINGLE SOLVENT 



131 



In the mixer of the ideal stage, equilibrium is established, so that the two- 
phase mixture M produces extract and raffinate solutions E and /J, the 
products of the operation, located on opposite ends of the tie line through 
M . The compositions of the streams E and R must be determined graphi- 
cally on the diagram (which may involve trial-and-error tie-line interpola- 
tion). Their weights may be computed either graphically,

Equation (6.6) then permits calculation of R. 

In the operation of such a plant, it is clear that if the mixture M is not 
within the two-liquid-phase area, no separation by extraction will occur. 
Consequently there is a minimum amount of solvent which will locate M 
at point Z), given by 



DS

(6.15) 



which results in a maximum of raffinate of composition D and no extract. 
There is also a maximum amount which will locate M at G,

(6.16) 



resulting in a maximum of extract of composition G and no raffinate. 
real plant must use an amount of solvent between these limits. 

Stage Efficiency. The theoretical 
stage produces as effluent two streams, 
extract and raffinate, which are in 
equilibrium. However, if agitation is 
inadequate or if insufficient time of 
contact is maintained between solvent 
and solution to be extracted, the 
streams issuing from the stage will not 
be in equilibrium, or, as it is expressed, 
the stage efficiency is less than 100 per 
cent. Refer to Fig. 6.4. When sol- 
vent S is added to feed F, at first two 
saturated phases at D and G are very FIG. 6.4. Diffusion in a theoretical stage.

quickly produced (6), which will be dispersed one within the other if agi- 
tation is sufficiently vigorous. Diffusion of the various components of 
the mixture, a relatively slow process, then gradually changes the com- 
positions of the phases along the solubility curve through L and K, 
eventually to R and E at opposite ends of the tie line through M , repre- 
senting the mixture as a whole. Only if the compositions R and E are 
realized is the stage considered a theoretical stage. 

Solvent Recovery. Although not strictly part of the extraction opera- 
tion, all such separations are ordinarily followed by removal of solvent from 
the extract and raffinate solutions to give the finished .products. Figure 
6.5 shows a typical extraction solvent recovery scheme. Distillation is

ordinarily used to remove the solvent from the solutions, and if it is assumed 
that relative volatilities are comparatively low so that incomplete solvent 
separation results, two recovered solvents, SB from the extract and SR from 
the raffinate, are produced. The finished products E f and R' also carry 
some of the unremoved solvent. The recovered solvents are mixed to give 
the recycle solvent S', make-up solvent (usually pure B) is added to 
balance the loss of solvent in the finished streams E' and R', and the result- 
ing mixture S used again in extraction. 

The entire series of operations can be followed conveniently on the tri- 
angular diagram, as in Fig. 6.6. When solvent SR is removed from raffinate 
R, finished raffinate R' results. Material balances on the raffinate solvent

As a result of the complete operation, therefore, the feed F has been 
separated into two solutions, one at E' rich in C, the other at R', rich in A. 

In the frequently arising situation 
where the feed consists solely of A 
and C, where pure B is the solvent 
and solvent recovery is substantially 
complete so that 




S = 



= B (6.29) 



the diagram is much simplified, as 
in Fig. 6.7. For such a situation, 
E' and R r are on the A-C axis of 
the diagram, and all of the equa- 
tions developed above apply with 
the additional simplifications that 
XBS = XBB == 1&gt; and Xcs == XBF 
XBE&gt; XBR&gt; = 0. 

Consider the situation described in the diagram of Fig. 6.8a. The point 
E', where E'B is tangent to the binodal curve, is clearly the maximum 
possible concentration of C in a finished extract, and can be realized for all 
feeds with C concentrations between XCF&gt; and XCE'. It is also clear that 
XCE* in this diagram represents the maximum concentration of C in any 
feed that can be processed. Similarly, referring to Fig. 6.86, the maximum

tact extraction with solvent recovery.

possible concentration of A in the finished raffinate R' is obtained by using 
the maximum amount of solvent with zero yield of raffinate. There is no 
absolute upper limit to the A concentration in the raffinate, but the actual 
maximum depends on the feed composition. 

Type 2 ternary systems are handled in the same fashion as those of Type 
1, and the construction diagrams for the general and simplified cases are

shown in Fig. 6.9. All the equations previously developed apply. For 
such systems there is no absolute upper limit to the purity of C in the 
finished extract or of A in the finished 
raffinate, with the actual maxima for 
a given feed depending upon the tie 
lines through points G and D.

for the flowsheet of Fig. 6.4 can be 
followed on the Janecke diagram if 
it is recalled that the S-free weights 
of the various streams are F, S, E,

feed stream, the coordinates are 
N F (lb. B)/(lb. A + Ib. C), X F (lb. C)/ 
(Ib. A + Ib. C), etc. Figure 6.10 
shows the construction for a Type 1 
system (the construction is identical 
for Type 2 systems, but the solubility

DIFFERENTIAL EXTRACTION 

Differential extraction, as previously pointed out, is analogous in many 
respects to differential distillation. It is not used industrially and is of 
interest principally as a laboratory procedure and because it represents the 
limiting result of increasing the number of stages of a cocurrent extraction. 
Like its distillation counterpart, actual operations 
can probably only approach the more or less ideal 
situation described below. 

Imagine the container of Fig. 6.15 filled initially 
with a solution F to be extracted. Solvent S is 
admitted slowly to the bottom of the container (if 
the solvent has a lower specific gravity than the 
solution). If the initial solution is not saturated, 
i.e., not located on the binodal curve of a phase 
diagram, the first portions of solvent added will 
dissolve until the solution is saturated. Further 
addition of solvent results in the formation of an 
extract layer which collects at the top where it 
is immediately withdrawn. Thorough agitation 
should be maintained within the vessel so that the 
extract leaving is at all times in equilibrium with the raffinate solution re- 
maining behind.

At a later stage in the process, after ex-

nate in the container be R. By addition 
of a differential amount of solvent dS 
the raffinate layer is reduced by an 
amount dR, producing an extract layer 
at E of an amount dE, at the opposite 
end of a tie line. The new raffinate,

Sf = Ef + R ff - R Q (6.67) 

To this should be added the initial solvent required to saturate feed, 
Eq. (6.56). The final composite extract composition can be obtained by a

COCURRENT MULTIPLE CONTACT 

This process is an extension of single-contact extraction, wherein the 
raffinate from the first stage is extracted with fresh solvent of the same 
composition in successive stages, as the flowsheet of Fig. 6.18o indicates, 
the concentration of C in the raffinate thus being further reduced. Dif- 
ferent quantities of solvent may be used in the various stages. 

The methods of calculation are more or less obvious from the construction 



STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH A SINGLE SOLVENT

on the triangular coordinates of Fig. 6.186. Each raffinate becomes the 
feed to the succeeding stage. Accordingly, Eqs. (6.6) to (6.16) for single- 
stage contact all apply exactly for the first stage of cocurrent multiple 
contact, with the substitution of Si, J5i, Ri, and Mi for S, E, 72, and M , 
respectively. Similarly, for any other stage, the wth for example, Eqs. 
(6.6) to (6.14) apply with the substitution of R m -i for F, and R m , E m , M m , 
and S m for R, E } M, and S, respectively. For all but the first stage, since 




A B

the feeds to each are necessarily saturated solutions, there is no minimum 
amount of solvent. The maximum solvent for any stage, as for single 
contact, must be such that the combined feed-solvent mixture forms two 
liquid phases. Construction for a Type 2 system is shown in Fig. 6.19. 

Solvent Recovery. Only a single raffinate, that from the last stage n, 
is treated for solvent recovery. The extracts from all stages are ordinarily 
combined and the mixture then treated for solvent recovery, although 
individual extracts may be treated separately if so desired. Refer to Fig. 
6.20. The flowsheet and construction are the same for single contact 
except that a combined extract E is prepared:

Purity of Products. The maximum purity of A in the raffinate will be 
given by an operation in which the nth tie line, corresponding to the last 
stage, passes through S when extended. This necessarily requires n to be 
infinity. The absolute maximum purity of C in the solvent-stripped extract 
will correspond to the case for single contact (tangency of solvent-removal 
line to the solubility curve for the combined extracts). Since E ordinarily 
falls within the two-liquid-phase area, this cannot usually be realized, 
however.

become vertical. 

Varying Temperature. If equilibrium and other considerations make it 
desirable to use different temperatures in each stage, the construction is 
modified in either coordinate system to include appropriate solubility 
curves and tie lines for each stage, as shown in Fig. 6.22. Here a two-stage 
plant uses temperatures ti and fe for the separate stages. The equations 
indicated above all apply as before. 

Types of Problems. Concentrations of solvent and feed and amount 
of feed are ordinarily fixed by the process. The principal additional var- 
iables are then the total amount of solvent, the proportioning of solvent 
among the stages, the number of stages, and extract and raffinate composi- 
tions. One may in addition to the fixed items mentioned above specify 



so

equire trial-and-error solutions to the problems. For a fixed amount of 
olvent and infinite stages, the net result will be the same as for differential 
extraction. 

Stage Efficiency. Each stage of the plant will behave in the manner 
lescribed previously for single-stage contact, producing equilibrium extracts 
md raffinates only if agitation is thorough and time of contact adequate. 
For a real plant, it may be found that m real stages are required to produce

puted. Then,

Immiscible Solvents. If the liquids A and B may be considered com- 
pletely immiscible, or at least if their solubility does not change over the 
range of concentration of distributed substance C under the process condi- 
tions, calculations may be conveniently simplified (2). Assume that A Ib. 
of component A is contained in the feed and all the raffinates and that

the B content of the extract from any stage equals that in the extracting 
solvent to the stage. We may then define a coordinate system y = XCB/ 
XBB for extract solutions, x = XCA/XAA for raffinate solutions, and plot an 
equilibrium-distribution curve at the temperature of the extraction opera- 
tion, as in Fig. 6.23. The extract from the rath stage will then have the 
concentration y my and the raffinate x m . The C concentration of the sol- 
vent and feed will be y a and X F . The total weights of the various streams 
then become

Equation (6.87) is the equation of a straight line on the coordinates of 
Fig. 6.23 of slope (A/B^), passing through the two points whose coordi- 



152 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

nates are (x m ,y m ) and (x m -i,2/s) . Since the effluent streams from a theoretical 
stage are at equilibrium, the point (x m ,y m ) is on the equilibrium-distribu- 
tion curve. For the first stage, therefore, a line of slope (A/B\) is erected 
from point V(xp,ys) which will intersect the equilibrium curve at T(xi,yi). 
The second stage is constructed from point (7, etc., until the final extract 
and raffinate concentrations are reached at W. The same reduction in 
raffinate concentration could be obtained in a single stage represented by 
the line WV at a corresponding increase in solvent consumption. 

The same diagram and method of construction can be frequently used 
with other concentration units. Thus, if the solutions are dilute in C, 
without appreciable change in density throughout the operation, x and y 
may be expressed as weight of C/unit volume of solution, in which case 
F, S, E y and R are measured in volumes; or as x = weight of C/volume of A , 
y = weight of C/volume of 5, in which case A and B are measured in 
volumes. 

Distribution Law. In the special case where solvents are immiscible 
and the distribution law holds, 

y m = mx m (6.88) 

where m is the constant distribution coefficient, and if further y s = and 
equal quantities of solvent B are used in each stage, then the first contact 
is represented by

It may be concluded from Eq. (6.93) that for a given total amount of solvent 
B t) the larger the value of n the greater will be the amount of extraction or 
the smaller the value of x n . Further, equal subdivision of the solvent among 
the stages results in more effective extraction than unequal (20). If the 
total available solvent B t is divided into n equal portions for n stages, x n

Use of an extremely large number of stages is rarely warranted, since it 
has been shown (1, 15) that if B t is fixed, at least 94 per cent of the maximum 
removal possible will be attained with five stages. Equation (6.93) may

Since XCRS = 0.134 and XcRt 0.075, whereas the desired raffinate from the last stage 
is XCR = 0.10, then three stages are too few, four too many. About 3.5 stages are 
required. There are three alternatives: (a) use three stages and slightly more solvent 
per stage, determining the quantity to be used by trial until XCRZ = 0.10, (b) use four 
stages and slightly less solvent, again with a trial-and-error procedure, or (c) accept the 
7.5% acetone in the final raffinate. Note that if the over-all stage efficiency were 
(3.5/4)100 = 87.5%, four real stages would be satisfactory. 

Accepting alternative (c), the final raffinate = 50.3 Ib., containing 0.075(50.3) = 3.77

LIQUID EXTRACTION 
COUNTERCURRENT MULTIPLE CONTACT 



In this type of extraction, a cascade of stages is employed, with feed and 
solvent entering at opposite ends of the cascade, raffinate and extract solu- 
tions flowing countercurrently, as in Fig. 6.26. 




FIG. 6.26. Flowsheet for countercurrent multiple-contact extraction. 

Triangular Coordinates. Refer to Fig. 6.27 (2, 6). Assume that the 
location of F, Ei y R n , and S are known. A material balance for the entire 

plant is 

F + S = E l + R n = M (6.96) 

or 

F-E l ^R n -S = (6.97)

STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH A SINGLE SOLVENT 157 

Consideration of Eqs. (6.99) and (6.101) shows that any extract E m +i can 
be located from any raffinate R m by extending the line OR m to the J3-rich 
solubility curve. As with all ideal stages, extract E m and raffinate R m will 
be in equilibrium and on opposite ends of a tie line. Consequently R\ 
may be located at the opposite end of a tie line through E\ } Ei by line OR\ 
extended, R 2 by a tie line through B 2 , etc. The operating point may be 
located either on the feed or solvent side of the triangle, depending upon 
the relative amounts of feed and solvent and the slope of the tie lines. 

M may be calculated and its coordinates determined by Eqs. (6.7), 
(6.9), and (6.10). E\ and R n may be determined by combining Eq. (6.96) 
with a C balance : 



M(XcM

For any stage w, the total material balance of Eq. (6.100) may be rear-

An A balance for stage ra: 

Rm-\XAR m -\ + E m+ iXAE m +i ~ RmXARm + E m XAE m (6.104) 

Combining the last two equations: 



D rn- m -l m+ i mm +i m , a nneN 

K m - T? - v - (p.lUo; 





Thus we may calculate Si by Eq. (6.105) by letting m 1 = Fandm = 1; 
E 2 by Eq. (6.99) with m = 1; B 2 by Eq. (6.105) with m = 2; E z by Eq. 
(6.99) with m = 2, etc. In this fashion all extracts and raffinates may be 
determined after the necessary concentrations are read from the triangular 
diagram. 

Limitations on Amount of Solvent. It is clear from the construction of 
Fig. 6.27 that if an extended tie line passed through the operating point 0, 
the stepwise determination of stages could necessarily not pass beyond 
this tie line, and an infinite number of stages would be required even to 
reach it, a condition known in distillation as a "pinch." For a real plant, 
the line R n S may not, therefore, coincide with a tie line, else a pinch will 
occur at the solvent end of the plant. The farther point is from R n , 
the greater the amount of solvent indicated. The procedure for determin- 
ing the minimum solvent can therefore be outlined (refer to Fig. 6.28). 
Draw line R n S extended, and extend all tie lines to intersection with the 
line R n S. The intersection farthest from R n (tie line HJ in the figure, with 
intersection at 0') corresponds to the minimum solvent. A real operating 
point 0, with a correspondingly greater amount of solvent, must be chosen. 
In most cases, a tie line DG which passes through F will locate the minimum- 
solvent operating point but not in the example shown. If the tie lines 



158 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



slope downward toward the B apex, their intersections with RJ5 will be 
on the solvent side of the triangle, in which case the nearer the intersection 
to point S the greater the indicated amount of solvent. 

C 




Fio. 6.28. Minimum solvent in countercurrent multiple contact. 

The maximum amount of solvent will be such that the feed solution is 
entirely dissolved, as in the case for a single-contact operation. 

Solvent Recovery. Since but a single raffinate and a single extract are 
the products of this type of operation, solvent-recovery calculations are 
identical with those of the single-contact operation described previously. 
The maximum purity of C in the finished extract will accordingly result if 
the solvent-removal line EI&amp;B is tangent to the binodal curve.

shows a typical construction for a two-stage plant with temperatures t\ and

Distribution Diagram. If the number of stages is large, calculations 
are frequently more conveniently made on a simple distribution diagram

distribution curve X C E m vs. X C R m , corresponding to the equilibrium data 
of Fig. 6.30a. From the operating point 0, lines such as OE m +\ are drawn 
at random, giving corresponding coordinates of R m and E m+i . These need 
not coincide with the stage lines used previously. The coordinates are 
transferred to the distribution diagram to form the operating curve. Step-

the stages and the corresponding raffinate and extract concentrations- 
Minimum solvent conditions (infinite stages) are indicated on the diagram

the diagram so that R n and E n fall on the ends of a tie line; (6) n and either

In similar fashion the remaining extract and raffinate weights may be calculated. 

It is now possible to set up a comparison of a typical extraction by the 
three processes of differential, cocurrent, and countercurrent contact. 
The calculations described in Illustrations 3 and 5 were supplemented by 
determining the number of stages and extract compositions for amounts 
of solvent other than those considered previously. In each case, the same 
feed, final raffinate, and solvent compositions were used. The results are 
summarized in Fig. 6.34. It is seen that for a given number of stages less 
solvent is required in countercurrent operation, with less extract solution 
resulting and consequent higher solute concentration in the extract, except 
for a single stage where both operations are identical. Increasing the 
number of stages beyond 5 results in relatively small changes. The limiting 
condition (oo stages) for the countercurrent case was determined by the 
methods described for minimum solvent, for the cocurrent case by the re-

suits of Illustration 2 for differential extraction. Curves of this sort may 
differ considerably from those shown, depending upon the equilibrium 
data and feed and solvent compositions. See for example those of Var- 
teressian and Fenske (22).

Illustration 6. One hundred pounds per hour of a feed solution containing 30% 
isopropanol (&lt;?), 70% water (A) are to be extracted by countercurrent multiple contact 
with pure benzene (B) as solvent at 25C. The saturated final raffinate is to contain 2% 
isopropanol. Determine the minimum quantity of solvent that may be used. 

Solution. Equilibrium data of Olsen and Washburn [/. Am. Chem. Soc. 67, 303 
(1935)] are used. See Fig. 6.35, where several of the tie lines are indicated. Basis: 1 hr. 

F - 100 lb., XCF = 0.30, X AF = 0.70

F and R n are located on the diagram and the line BR n extended is drawn. The tie lines 
in this system slope downward toward the A apex above about 24% isopropanol, down- 
ward toward the B apex below. Tie line HJ is parallel to line BR n . 

Extension of tie line DG, which passes through F, intersects the line BR n at 0'. The 
operating point may therefore not lie between 0' and R n . Any operating point to the 
left of 0' will be unsatisfactory, since it will represent an intersection of line BR n with

some tie line between DG and HJ. Tie lines below HJ intersect line RnB to the right 
of B, and the nearer the operating point to B on this extension, the greater the amount of 
solvent indicated. Tie lines LN and PQ, when extended, both intersect RnB at 0", the 
nearest to B. Tie lines below PQ and between LN and HJ all intersect RnB farther to 
the right. The point 0" therefore represents the operating point for minimum solvent.

Multiple Feed. The problem of two or more feed solutions of different 
compositions, both of which are to be extracted in the same cascade of 
stages to give a single raffinate and extract occasionally arises. Consider, 
for example, the flowsheet of Fig. 6.36, with two feed solutions, F and F'. 
Feed F' has a C concentration between that of F and R n and so can be 
introduced into the cascade conveniently at the point where the raffinate 
concentration corresponds most closely to that of F'.

168 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



or, letting F + F' = L, and rearranging, 

F + F f - E l = L - Ei = R n - S = 0' (6.123) 

Therefore, an operating point 0' is established, much as with a single feed, 
using the combined feeds L together with E\, R n , and S. A material bal- 
ance for stages in through n is 

F' + R m , l + S = R n + E m (6.124) 



or 



F' + 



(6.125) 



i - E m = R n - S = 0' 




FIG. 6.38. Stage relationships with multiple feed. 

Consequently the operating point 0' is used for all stages between m and n 
in the manner as for a single feed. For convenience, we may consider the 
feed to stage m as a combination of Rm~i and F', Rm^-i + F f = T, and 
calculations can be made for this end of the cascade exactly as before. 
For stages 1 through m 1, the material balance is 

F + E m = R m -i + E l (6.126) 

or 

F - E l = # n _i ~ E m = (6.127) 

Consequently an operating point is used for stages 1 through m 1. 
Combining Eqs. (6.123) and (6.127), 

+ F' = R n - S = 0' (6.128) 

from which we see that O f is on the line F'O. The complete construction,

ating point 0' is therefore used for stages m through n.

are to be extracted in a countercurrent system with 50 Ib./hr. of 1,1,2-trichloroethane 
at 25C. to give a raffinate containing 10% acetone. Calculate the number of stages and

The latter is an equation of a straight line, t/ m +i vs. x m , of slope A/B, since 
2/i and XF are constants for a given plant. Since m represents any stage, 
the line (an " operating line") is applicable to the entire plant and may be 
drawn between the two points whose coordinates are (xp y y\) and (x n ,ys), 
as on Fig. 6.43. Since the equilibrium curve represents the relation- 
ship between x m and y m , the stages can be represented by steps drawn 
between the equilibrium curve and the operating line, as shown. 

A common problem is one where A, XF } x n , and y$ are fixed. The operat- 
ing line must then start at point G (Fig. 6.43) and end on the line whose 



STAQEWISE CONTACT WITH A SINGLE SOLVENT 



173 



abscissa is XF, at an ordinate depending upon the solvent rate. At high 
solvent rates the operating line will be relatively flat, and few stages will 
be required. At low solvent rates, the reverse is true. Decreasing the sol- 
vent rate will ultimately bring the operating line to point D on the figure, 
for which the number of stages is infinite, corresponding to the minimum 
solvent rate. It should be noted that, prior to this, should the operating 
line become tangent to the equilibrium curve at any point between x n 
and X F , its slope will then indicate the minimum solvent rate.

Distribution Law. If in addition to solvent immiscibility the distribu- 
tion law [Eq. (6.88)] also applies, further simplification is possible. A 
material balance around stages m + 1 through n is 

Ax m + By s = Ax n + By m + t (6.131) 

Substituting Eq. (6.88) in the form y m +\ = mz m +i, and rearranging: 



(A\ _ _

The last equation may be so solved as to eliminate the concentrations of the 
raffinates of adjacent stages by the calculus of finite differences (19). If

which may be used to calculate intermediate raffinate concentrations 
without the necessity for graphical work. 

Refer to Fig. 6.44. For a fixed value of XF, ys, and y\ 9 the operating line 
must start on a line of ys ordinate and terminate at point K. If the ratio 
of the slope of the equilibrium curve to that of the operating line mB/A 



174

is greater than unity, the final raffinate concentration will be the least for 
oo stages, and the operating line GK results. For such a situation, the 
extent of extraction X F (ys/m) is the greatest. If in a real plant of n 
stages, the extent of extraction is XF x n , then

which is defined by Tiller (19) as the " relative extraction efficiency" of 
the plant. This relationship exactly parallels another derived for gas- 
absorption operations by Kremser (9) 
and modified by Souders and Brown 
(17). It is most effective in the 
graphical form prepared by Sher- 
wood (16), Fig. 6.45, where solution 
of the equation for n is readily made. 
The figure also permits ready deter- 
mination of the minimum solvent 
ratio by use of the line n = oo . The 
quantity mB/A, which appears so 
frequently in developments of this 
sort, is termed the " extraction fac- 
tor." 

If, on the other hand, mB/A is 
fixed at a value less than unity, the 
extent of extraction is definitely lim- 
ited, giving rise to an operating line LD (Fig. 6.44) with the "pinch" at the 
feed end [of the cascade. A 1 real plant must have a value of x n greater 
than Xi. Tiller (19) redefines relative extraction efficiency for this case as

For mB/A = 1, by differentiation of numerator and denominator to 
resolve the indeterminate, the relative efficiency becomes n/(n + 1). 

Illustration S. One hundred pounds per hour of a 4.5% solution of acetaldehyde 
(C) in toluene (A) is to be extracted with water (B) in a five-stage countercurrent plant

Batchwise Operation. The operation as described is necessarily con- 
tinuous. Its effects can be approached batchwise in the laboratory by a 
complicated manipulation of stages, described by Jantzen (8) and Hunter 
and Nash (7) who evaluate the percentage approach to the true counter- 
current effect in terms of the number of stages used and their arrangement. 

COUNTERCURRENT MULTIPLE CONTACT WITH REFLUX 

Extension of a simple countercurrent operation to one involving the use 
of reflux provides a process which is analogous in its essentials to the recti- 
fication type of distillation. Whereas in the extraction operations de- 
scribed previously the richest extract leaving the plant was nearly in equi- 
librium with the feed solution, by proper use of reflux it is possible not only 
to separate systems showing unfavorable distribution coefficients but also 
to enrich the extract beyond that which is merely in equilibrium with the 
feed (7, 14, 18). 

Consider the flowsheet of Fig. 6.47. The feed solution F is separated 
into an extract product PE and a raffinate product P R) both relatively 
far removed in composition from the feed. Stages 1 through (/ 1) 
serve to increase the C content of the extract, providing a primary product 
EI. After removal of either all or most of the solvent to give a solution E', 
the final extract product PE is withdrawn, allowing a portion of the stream 
RQ to return to the plant as extract reflux flowing countercurrently to the 
enriching extract. The solvent separator (analogous to the condenser in 
rectification) is customarily a distillation device, and it removes sufficient 
solvent so that EI and E' are at least on opposite sides of the solubility 
curve describing the ternary equilibria. E', R , and PE are all of the same 
composition and may or may not be saturated (located on the solubility 
curve). 

Stages / + 1 through n constitute the raffinate stripping section of the 
cascade, where the raffinate solution is exhausted of its C content. The 
primary raffinate product R n is divided into two streams: P#, the saturated 
raffinate product, may be further treated to remove solvent and to provide 
the finished raffinate PR, and operation not concerned with the extraction 
operation; and R' n , which when mixed with the extracting solvent S, pro- 
vides the raffinate reflux 23 n +i. Rn, Rn, and PR are of the same composi- 



STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH A SINGLE SOLVENT 



177 



tion, and sufficient solvent S must be added at, least to bring the composi- 
tion of E n +i to the opposite side of the solubility curve but not so much 
that complete miscibility results in stage n. The entire operation is neces- 
sarily continuous; a batch wise series of operations can at best only approach 
it in net effect.

the solvent separator shows

Ei - S E + PE + Rv (6.137) 

Let 

SE + PE = Q (6.138)

Q is therefore on the line S&amp;E', between EI and SB. A material balance

enriching section is 

E e+1 = SE + PE + Re (6.140)

(6.141) 



and consequently Q represents the net flow in the direction of the extract 
end of the plant, for all stages from 1 through (/ 1). A line on the tri- 
angular coordinates radiating from Q into the body of the triangle will cut 
the J8-rich solubility curve at a concentration corresponding to the extract 
entering a given stage, while it cuts the A -rich solubility curve at a concen- 
tration corresponding to the raffinate from the same stage. Since for

any stage extract E e and raffinate R e are in equilibrium and are located 
on opposite ends of a tie line, the stepwise construction of alternate tie 
lines and lines from Q as on Fig. 6.48 will establish all concentrations and

corresponding to the extract entering that stage. Since, as before, extract

tion of alternating tie lines and radiating lines from Q and TF, it is clear that 
should the extension of any tie line in the extract-enriching section pass 
through Q, or in the raffinate-stripping section through W, it would require 
an infinite number of stages merely to reach this tie line by the stepwise 
procedure. Equation (6.148) indicates that the nearer Q lies to SE, the 
larger the reflux ratio. For the extract-enriching section, therefore, the

minimum possible reflux ratio still requiring infinite stages would place Q 
at the intersection which is nearest SE of an extended tie line in this section 
and line E'Ss, such as tie line D(?, Fig. 6.51. Similarly in the raffinate- 
stripping section, Eq. (6.161) indicates that the nearer W is located to S, the 
larger the reflux ratio. Consequently the minimum possible reflux ratio 
will be such that W is at the intersection which is nearest to S of an extended 
tie line and line R n S, such as tie line HJ, Fig. 6.51. Since Eq. (6.169) 
must likewise be satisfied, either Q or W must be placed at one of these 
intersections and the other adjusted so that F, Q, and W are on the same 
straight line. Equations (6.144), (6.148), (6.157), and (6.161) then give 
the minimum reflux ratios for the case at hand. In many instances, the 
minimum reflux ratio will be established simultaneously for both sections 
of the cascade by the tie line LK which when extended passes through F

(23), but not in the case illustrated in Fig. 6.51. In an actual plant, W 
must be nearer S, and Q nearer SE, than the positions thus chosen. 

Total Reflux. For the least number of stages, corresponding to total 
reflux or infinite reflux ratio, no raffinate product or extract product 
is withdrawn from the plant. To maintain the material balance, F and 
consequently the capacity of the plant must be zero. R n = R'n, Ro = E r , 
S = SB, and points Q and W both coincide with S on the triangular dia- 
gram. The construction is shown on Fig. 6.52.

Optimum Reflux Ratio. For any plant, the number of stages will vary 
regularly in a manner dependent upon the ternary equilibria and feed, 
solvent, and product compositions, from the minimum number at total 
reflux to infinity at minimum reflux ratio. The cost of the stages thus at 
first decreases rapidly as reflux ratio increases, but since their capacity 
must increase at high reflux ratios, their cost passes through a minimum. 
Simultaneously the quantity of liquids to be handled, solvent inventory, 
and the cost of solvent recovery per unit of feed handled increases continu- 
ally with reflux ratio, with consequent increasing operating cost. The total 
cost per unit of feed, which is the sum of investment and operating cost, 
will therefore show a minimum at what is termed the optimum reflux ratio.

Pure B as Solvent. A simple case frequently arising is one where the 
solvent is pure B, F contains no 5, and the solvent removed at the extract 
end of the plant is pure B. The equations previously presented all apply, 
and the construction diagram is altered so that F is on the A-C axis, and S 
on the B apex. The change requires no further explanation. Other 
modifications, such as the use of different temperatures in the various 
stages, are obvious from what has been described in connection with the 
other methods of extraction.

Distribution Coordinates. Where the number of stages is very large, 
transfer of the stage calculations to XCA vs. XCB coordinates is useful. 
The general principles are the same as for countercurrent extraction with- 
out reflux. Random lines are drawn on ', i; :!,. coordinates from the 
operating points Q and W, and the concentrations at the intersections of 
these lines with the solubility curve plotted as an operating curve, as in 
Fig. 6.53. The discontinuity in this curve occurs as the transition is made 
from Q to W as operating points. The stages are then stepped off. Mini- 
mum reflux conditions will appear as in Fig. 6.54, where the pinch is shown 
in the extract-enriching section. The pinch may, of course, occur at the 
feed or in the raffinate-stripping section. The condition of total reflux, 
with minimum stages, is indicated in Fig. 6.55.

from the same stage. As in the case of triangular coordinates, the internal

pendent; only one may be arbitrarily fixed. For component B: 

TFN F + WNw = Q^ (6.203)

which is convenient for the analytical determination of the coordinates of

Minimum Reflux Ratio. The general principles are the same as for tri- 
angular coordinates. If any tie line in the extract-enriching section passes 
through point Q when extended, an infinite number of stages are required 
to reach this tie line. Similarly, an extended tie line in the raffinate-strip- 
ping section passing through point W leads to infinite stages. The nearer 
Q lies to SE, the greater the extract reflux [Eq. (6.180)]; the farther W 
from PR, the greater the raffinate reflux [Eq. (6.195)]. The procedure for 
minimum reflux ratio may then be briefly outlined (refer to Fig. 6.57). 
Extend all tie lines in the extract-enriching section to intersection with 
line E'Ss and note the intersection nearest SB, point D on the figure. Ex- 
tend all tie lines in the raffinate-stripping section to intersection with line 
SPR and note the one farthest from S, point G on the figure. Choose one 
of these, G for W or D for Q, consistent with the facts that F, TF, and Q 
must be on the same straight line and that Q may not be lower than D nor 
W higher than G. Equations (6.180) and (6.195) then give the minimum 
reflux ratio. In most instances, the tie line H J, which when extended 
passes through F, will locate simultaneously W and Q for minimum reflux 
but not in the case illustrated.

Total Reflux. For the least number of stages, the capacity of the plant 
for feed solution is zero, and no products are withdrawn. S, SE, Q, and W 
coincide as on Fig. 6.58. For pure solvent B into the solvent mixer, S will 
be at infinity and the radiating stage construction lines become vertical.

Type 2 Systems. Computations thus far described include diagrams for 
Type 1 systems only. The arrangement of the graphical work and the 
equations all apply exactly for Type 2 systems. However, whereas in the 
case of Type 2 systems use of reflux and pure B as extracting solvent will 
make possible the production of raffinate and extract products containing 
as nearly pure A and C, respectively, as desired, for Type 1 systems only 
the raffinate may be enriched to such an extent. The maximum purity of 
C in the extract will be limited to a solvent-separation line SsE f which is 
tangent to the binodal curve.

Extract Reflux Only. Should the feed be extremely weak in component 
C, or if the distribution coefficient for C is very unfavorable for the solvent 
chosen at C concentrations above that in the feed, it is possible to operate 
with extract reflux only (7, 14, 18), as with the flowsheet of Fig. 6.61. At

extracts E\ and E', the product PE, and reflux #0, the entire arrangement is 
the same as for countercurrent contact with two feeds (F and B ). Omit- 
ting stages (/ + 1) through n would provide an operation analogous to the 
use of a rectification section only in a distillation column.

is essentially the same as before, with the exception that points S and En+i 
coincide at S. 

Especially with feeds rich in C and with Type 1 systems, the use of extract 
reflux does not always give improvement over the results expected for 
ordinary countercurrent contact, since frequently it happens that a higher 
finished extract C concentration can be obtained without it.

The construction is shown in Fig. 6.64. Q and E f coincide at E f [Eq. 
(6.217)], and the raffinate-stripping section is identical with the arrange- 
ment involving both reflux streams. 

The Janecke diagrams for both of the cases just described are obvious 
from the description of the triangular coordinate construction and need no 
additional explanation. See also the following illustration. 

Illustration 10. One hundred pounds per hour of a feed solution containing 25% 
ethanol (C), 75% water (A), is to be reduced to 2% ethanol (saturated) with ethyl ether 
(B) as solvent. Twice the minimum raffinate reflux ratio is to be used, and the reflux 
E n + 1 is to be saturated. The temperature is to be 25C. Calculate the number of 
stages and amount of solvent required. 

Solution. The equilibrium data are available in " International Critical Tables" 
(Vol. Ill, p. 405). Because of crowding on triangular coordinates, the Janecke diagram 
will be used, Fig. 6.65. Basis: 1 hr. F = 100 lb., XF = 25/100 = 0.25, Np = 0. For 
a saturated raffinate product, XCP R = 0.02, XAP R = 0.92, XBP R = 0.06. Xp R X# n = 
X*' = 0.02/0.94 = 0.0213, NP R = N Rn = N R &gt; n = 0.06/0.94 = 0.0639. Since pure 
ether is the solvent, X# n+1 = X PR = 0.0213, N En +i = 73.9. The plait point and tie 
lines to the right of F, Fig. 6.65, are so located that extract reflux would not appreciably 
increase the value of X for the final extract. Therefore only raffinate reflux will be used 
(Fig. 6.63). 

For minimum raffinate reflux, tie lines to the left of F are extended. Tie line DO 
intersects line E n +\PR at the lowest value, Nw =1.8.

Constant Selectivity (22, 23). For some Type 2 systems, the selectivity 
]8 as defined by Eq. (4.2) is constant. Recalling that A -rich solutions are 
raffinates, JB-rich solutions extracts, and that the selectivity is determined 
by equilibrium concentrations, we may write Eq. (4.2) for any stage m as 

|^ = /3|^ (6.218) 



which leads to simplification of the calculations for total and minimum 
reflux. 

Confining the discussion to cases where pure B is the solvent, and where 
feed and products are saturated with solvent on the 4 -rich solubility curve, 
material balances for total reflux around the solvent mixer and stage n are 
(Fig. 6.47):

At minimum reflux ratio for such systems, the pinch occurs at the feed 
stage. A total material balance of the extract end of the plant through 
stage/ 1, with pure B as the solvent removed, is 

E f = BE + PE - Rf-i (6.229)

But X AEf = X C E f X ARf /p XCR P with the pinch at the feed stage, XcR f =

Illustration 11. A solution containing 50% n-heptane (A), 50% cyclohexano (C) 
(on a solvent^free basis) is to be separated into a raffinate containing 95% heptane and 
an extract containing 95% cyclohexane (both percentages on a solvent-free basis), with 
aniline (B) as the extracting solvent at 25C., in a countercurrent multiple contact system 
with reflux. Feed, reflux, and product streams are to be saturated with solvent, and 
pure solvent will be added at the mixer and removed from the extract solvent separator. 
Determine the minimum number of stages and the minimum reflux ratio. 

Solution. The equilibrium data* for this Type 2 system [Hunter and Brown, Ind. 
Eng. Chem. 39, 1343 (1947)] show ft to be nearly constant with an average value of 1.4. 
The saturated compositions, taken from the phase diagram, are as follows: XCF = 0.447, 
XAF = 0.447; X C p B = 0.80, X A p E = 0.042; X C p R = 0.046, X APR - 0.871.

Component C:

Component A : 

100(0.447) = P*(0.042) + P*(0.871) 

Solving simultaneously, 

PR = 48.6 lb., P E = 53.0 Ib. 
R/.i = 4.15P* = 4.15(53.0) = 220 lb. 

At minimum reflux ratio, R/ t R/-I, and F have the same compositions. Therefore E/ 
is in equilibrium with F. 



Reference to the phase diagram shows XCE/ = 0.068. 

Eq. (6.168): B E + PE = E f - #,_i 

BE + 53.0 = E f - 220 
C balance: 

53.0(0.80) = #/(0.068) - 220(0.447) 
Solving simultaneously, 

E f = 2,070 lb., BE = 1,797 lb. 

Ei is found on a phase diagram as a saturated solution on line BP#, so that 
XCE, = 0.215. Further, XCR = XCP E . 

Eq. (6.137): Ei = BE + PE + Ro 

Ei = 1797 + 53.0 4- Ro 
C balance: 

#i(0.215) = 53.0(0.80) + # (0.80) 
Solving simultaneously, 

Ei = 2,457 lb., Ro = 607 lb.

CHAPTER 7 

METHODS OF CALCULATION II. STAGEWISE CONTACT WITH 
MIXED AND DOUBLE SOLVENTS 

In the case of four or more components, difficulties in the calculations for 
the number of stages arise from the necessarily complicated diagrams re- 
quired for the representation of the equilibria and, even more restricting, 
almost complete lack of the equilibrium data themselves. In consequence, 
designs are frequently made on the basis of laboratory experiments rather 
than by direct computation from the phase relationships. The simple 
flowsheets applied to the simpler systems can be handled, however. 

MIXED SOLVENTS 

Mixed-solvent liquid extraction includes those operations where the 
extracting solvent is itself a homogeneous solution, so that there are a 
minimum of four components comprising the entire system : two components 
to be separated and two forming the extracting solvent. Solvent solutions 
are used in order to bring about a modification of the effects produced by a 
single solvent, such as improvement of the selectivity, lowering of the freez- 
ing point of the solvent, etc. The simplest of these systems, to which the 
following description is limited, involves only one partially miscible pair of 
components and certain unusual relationships among the ternary and 
quaternary equilibria. These are described in detail in Chap. 2 and Fig. 
2.32, to which reference should now be made. While it has not yet been 
demonstrated that all systems of this general type can be similarly de- 
scribed, it is known that certain mixed-solvent-petroleum combinations do 
conform, and consequently this case is of industrial importance. 

Single-contact Extraction. These calculations were first described by 
Hunter (10). Refer to Fig. 7.1. On tetrahedral diagrams of this sort, 
the geometrical rules applicable to mixtures on ternary triangular diagrams 
apply. Consequently, if feed solution F, a solution of components A and 
B, is extracted with solvent S, a solution of C and D, the point M represent- 
ing the mixture as a whole is on the straight line FS, such that

Since Af is within the two-liquid-phase portion of the diagram, two equi- 
librium solutions, raffinate R and extract E, located on opposite ends of the 
quaternary tie line result: 

R + E = M (7.3) 



R _EM 
E MR 



(7.4) 



The problem is then one of locating the points R and E. As previously 
pointed out (Chap. 2) the quaternary tie lines can be located at the inter- 
section of two planes, one passing through apex D and a tie line R'E' in the

ternary ABC, the other through apex A and tie line R"E" in the ternary 
BCD. We may therefore consider the mixing of feed and solvent as having 
occurred in two separate steps (Fig. 7.2) : (a) addition of C to F to give M ',

In each case, the amounts of C and D used are the same as that originally 
in S &gt; C + D = S_ (7.9) 

i - 1 &lt; 7 - io &gt; 

It is then necessary to locate the quaternary tie line RE passing through 
point M, which involves first locating ternary tie line R"E". The inter-

section of the planes R"E"A and R'E'D will then give RE. Were all the A 
to be removed from M, the result would be M ", which is necessarily in the 
plane R"E"A and on the tie line R"E". In turn, point M" may be 
established by mixing S with the proper amount of 5, 

B = FX BF = MX BM (7.11) 

Then 

S + B = AT (7.12) 



In the ternary BDS, tie line R"E" is then determined, permitting the loca- 
tion of quaternary tie line RE. 

The solvent-free finished raffinate and extract, R' n and E" r , can be 
determined (Fig. 7.3) by considering the removal of S from R and E in two 
separate steps: (a) removal of D from R and E to produce ternary mixtures 
K and L, and (6) removal of C from K and L to leave R'" and #'", thus 
completing the entire extraction operation. 



MIXED AND DOUBLE SOLVENTS

Actual computations cannot of course be made on the tetrahedral space 
diagram. Instead it is necessary to work with orthogonal projections of 
the various points and curves, most conveniently projections on the base 
BCD. Throughout these calculations, the same letter in the various 
figures consistently designates a given point, and points projected on the 
BCD plane are indicated by the lower-case counterparts of the letters 
designating the original point. Thus ra is the projection of M , etc. If the 




FIG. 7 3. Removal of solvents from raffinate and extract. 

quaternary coordinates of a point P are XAP, XBP, XCP, and XDP, where X 
represents weight fraction, then the coordinates of p, the orthogonal pro- 
jection of P on plane BCD, will be X Bp , X Cp , and X Dp , which may be 
evaluated from the relationship (Chap. 2) : 

XB P XBP -f~ Q , XC P = XCP ~h ~~5 &gt; XD P = XDP + (7 .14) 



In this way, projected coordinates may be computed and points plotted on 
the BCD plane. The various steps are numbered for convenient reference 
and are given in the order in which the calculations should be made (10). 
1. Refer to Fig. 7.4. Point/, the projection of F, is located on line Ba 
by calculation of its coordinates through Eq. (7.14). The coordinates of 
M are calculated from the material balances: 



M = F + S

and hence point m may be located (on line/S). Similarly the coordinates 
of M' are computed by Eq. (7.6) and 

XCM* TTi , etc. (7.16) 

Point m! is then plotted on line fC. Point m is at the intersection of lines 
m'DandfS. 

2. From the ternary equilibria for the system ABC, R f and E r are com- 
puted by the methods of Chap. 6, and r f and e f located on Fig. 7.4.

3. M" is located at the intersection of lines BS and aAf, Fig. 7.4. Tie 
line R"E" in the ternary system BCD is then located through M" by the 
methods of Chap. 6. 

4. The intersection PQ of the planes R'E'D and R"E"A (Fig. 7.5) is 
located by 

o. Extending r'e' to g and h, and drawing Dh and Dg. 

b. Extending R"E" to N and and drawing aN and aO. 

c. Locating p at the intersection of Dh and aJV, and q at the intersection 
of Dg and aO. Draw line pq, the projection of PQ. 

Tie-line projection re then lies on pq and to locate it requires a projection 
of the quaternary solubility curve R'RTEE'.

fore perpendicular to line BC, and z, the projection of Z, is on line WJ. 
The detailed construction to locate z is outlined as follows: 

a. On Fig. 7.5, any line WJ is drawn, perpendicular to BC, intersecting 
the ternary solubility curve at V. Lengths WJ and WV are measured. 




FIG. 7.7. Intersection of plane YJW with 
the base ABC. 



FIG. 7-8. Intersection of plane YJW with 
the base ACD. 



b. On a separate sheet, the base ABC with its ternary solubility curve is 
drawn (Fig. 7.7). W is located on line BC, and the perpendicular line YW 
is erected. The intersection of YW with the solubility curve is at V, and 
the lengths VW and YW are measured. The tie line R'E' is drawn, 
which intersects line YW at /. The length IW is measured. R'E' is 
Y extended to H and G. 

c. On a separate sheet, base ACD 
is drawn (Fig. 7.8). Points F, G, and 
J are marked. The lines YJ and GD 
are drawn to intersect at U. The 
lengths YU and YJ are measured. 

d. On a separate sheet (Fig. 7.9), a 
line of length WJ is drawn and the 
position of V marked (see a above). 
Since the lengths YW and YJ are 
known (see 6 and c), triangle YJW 
is constructed. Points V and I are 
located on line YW (see 6), as well as 
points U and V 7 (see a and c). Lines 

W and 7C7 are drawn to locate the intersection Z. A perpendicular is 
dropped from Z to line WJ to locate z. The length Wz is measured and 
transferred to Fig. 7.5. 

The entire procedure is repeated sufficiently often to permit drawing the

at r and e, as shown. 

6. The coordinates of r and e are then read. To determine the coordi- 
nates of R) draw line Dr on Fig. 7.5 (not shown), which intersects line hg 
at k. Line Ck is drawn and extended to intersect line aB at r'". The 
lengths Br r " and r'"a are measured. Since r'" is the projection of the 
solvent-free raffinate, _

Solving Eqs. (7.14) and (7.15) simultaneously then gives the coordinates 
of R. Those of E are determined in a similar manner. 

The calculations are necessarily tedious, and if a great number are to be 
made, the analytical methods of Wiegand (19) or the suggestions of Smith 
(16) are helpful. 

It must be emphasized again that the methods described are applicable 
only when the simple relationships between the various ternary and 
quaternary equilibria pertain and would have to be modified considerably 
for more complicated situations as knowledge of the equilibria in these 
systems is acquired. Similarly extraction calculations involving the more 
complex flowsheets must still be developed, although the case of cocurrent 
multiple contact can be handled as a simple extension of single contact 
where the raffinates are progressively put through the same procedure. 
Further developments, for example, operations wherein one of the solvents 
is progressively removed as the extraction proceeds from stage to stage 
(17), cannot at this time be conveniently evaluated. 

Illustration 1. One hundred pounds of a 20% acetone (A), 80% chloroform (J3), 
solution are to be extracted in a single-contact process with 100 Ib. of a mixed solvent 
consisting of 65% water (C), 35% acetic acid (&gt;), at 25C. Calculate the weights and 
compositions of extract and raffinate. 

Solution. Equilibria for the ternary and quaternary systems are reported by 
Brancker, Hunter, and Nash [J. Phys. Chem. 44, 683 (1940)]. The system is one of the 
type described above, and consequently only the ternary data are actually necessary. 
The computations are made in the order described above and are numbered accordingly. 
Standard triangular coordinates measuring 9.1 in. on a side were used, and distances were 
measured with a strip of 20-to-the-inch graph paper. Diagrams are not reproduced since 
they appear almost exactly as Figs. 7.4, 7.5, 7.7, 7.8, and 7.9. Figs. 7.4 and 7.5 are made

DOUBLE SOLVENTS (FRACTIONAL EXTRACTION) 

Double-solvent operations involve the distribution of a mixture, com- 
ponents B and C, between the immiscible solvents A and D, where B and C 
are both soluble in both A and D. One of the solvents, for example solvent 
A y is usually chosen so as preferentially to extract component B, while 
solvent D preferentially extracts component C. In this manner the separa-

tion is enhanced, and consequently double-solvent systems are usually 
employed where B and C are ordinarily separated with difficulty. Our 
knowledge of the equilibria in such systems is extremely sketchy, and in 
most cases resort must be had to actual laboratory extraction data. 

Single-stage Contact, Batchwise or Continuous. Should the entire 
quaternary equilibria for the system be of the type described for mixed 
solvents, Fig. 7.1, the calculations for single-stage contact can be made 
entirely rigorously. Refer to Fig. 7.10, which represents equilibria of the 
type previously described, relettered to conform to the present process. 
Feed F, a mixture of B and C, is extracted with incompletely soluble sol- 
vents A and D, used in such proportions that together they are represented

solvents, tie line RE can be located by determining the tie line R'E' which 
passes through M' in the base ABD, where M' is the C-free composition 
corresponding to M, and tie line R"E" through M" in the base A CD, where 
M" is the 5-free composition corresponding to M . Tie line R'E' and apex 
C form plane HOC which intersects plane NOB, formed from tie line R"E" 
and apex B, in line PQ which contains the quaternary tie line.

FIG. 7.11. Single-contact extraction with a double solvent, in projection. 

As before, the calculations are made largely in projection, as in Fig. 7.11, 
on base A CD where projected points are indicated by the lower-case letters 
corresponding to the points in the three-dimensional figure. Addition of 
double solvent to feed permits calculation of the coordinates of M , and 
hence of m. Point ra is thus located on line fS. The coordinates of M " 
are determined and plotted (on line bm extended). Ternary tie line R"E" 
is then located through m". The coordinates of M' are calculated, plotted 
on base ABD (not shown), tie line R'E' located through M', and points r' 
and e' plotted on Fig. 7.11. Line r'e' is extended to h and gr, and lines Ch 
and Cg drawn. R"E" is extended to N and 0, and lines bN and 60 drawn. 
Point p is located at the intersection of bN and Ch, q at the intersection of 
60 and Cg. Line pq then contains the tie-line projection re, which is located 
in the manner previously described for mixed solvents.

base BDC, from which D is removed to produce the finished product R"

to locate these points geometrically.

Lack of the complete equilibrium data usually requires the assumption 
that the substances to be separated (B and C) distribute themselves in- 
dividually and independently according to their respective distribution 
coefficients m B and me which remain constant. This in turn necessarily 
requires that (a) the solvents A and D are either substantially immiscible 



218 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

or are saturated with each other prior to use, (fe) that addition of B and C 
does not alter their insolubility, and (c) that the concentrations of B and C 
are always low. 

Thus, on mixing feed F with solvents A and D and upon reaching equi- 
librium, the weight of B in the resulting A-rich phase will be (A/X A A)(X B A), 
and in the Z)-rich phase (D/X DD )(X B D)' A B balance is therefore 

FX tt p = ^~ (XBA) + -f~ (X BD ) (7.20)

In similar fashion, a C balance is

and 

me = f^ (7.25)

Solving Eqs. (7.20) to (7.25) simultaneously permits calculation of the con- 
centrations at equilibrium. If, as will frequently happen, the solutions are 
so dilute that XAA and X DD are for all practical purposes equal to unity, 
Eqs. (7.20) and (7.21) reduceto 

FX BF = AX BA + DX BD (7.26) 

and 

FXcF = AXcA + DXcD (7.27) 

which may be used with Eqs. (7.24) and (7.25) to give the equilibrium con- 
centrations. Should m B and me vary with concentration, a trial-and-error 
calculation is necessary. For dilute solutions, the equations may also be 
used with X defined as weight of solution per unit volume, with F, A, and 
D defined as volumes. 

For a successful separation, the selectivity /3, as previously defined,

must exceed unity, the more so the better. Ordinarily, ft will be greater 
the more dilute the solutions. At the same time the product m^me should 
not be far removed from unity else the low concentration in one of the sol- 
vents will require excessive amounts of that solvent, thus aggravating the 



MIXED AND DOUBLE SOLVENTS 219 

solvent-recovery problem. Solvent pairs should be chosen with these con- 
siderations in mind. A and D may themselves be solutions, if thereby the 
distribution coefficients are improved. Van Dijck and Schaafsma (18) 
offer a convenient illustration: if equal parts of o- and p-oxybenzaldehyde 
are to be separated into two products, one rich in the ortho, the other rich 
in the para compound, each product at the same purity, 85 per cent 
aqueous ethanol and an aromatic-free gasoline may be used as a solvent 
pair. However, approximately 16 times as much gasoline as ethanol will 
be required, which produces an exceedingly low concentration in the gasoline 
phase. Replacing the gasoline with a mixture of 40 per cent benzene, 60 
per cent gasoline would increase the equilibrium concentrations of both 
solutes in the hydrocarbon phase considerably but will also cause too 
great a mutual solubility with the ethanol. If in addition, however, the 
ethanol is diluted to a 50 per cent concentration with water, the insolubility 
of the solvents is preserved, the equilibrium concentration of both solutes 
in the ethanol phase is reduced, and the selectivity is still favorable. As 
a consequence, a solvent ratio of 1.6 rather than 16 may be employed. 
Similarly, in separating mixtures of organic acids or bases, aqueous solu- 
tions may be buffered to alter the ionization constants of the solute, thus 
altering the distribution coefficients (7). See also the work of Garwin and 
Hixson (9), and McKee (14). 

Let PB represent the fraction of the B in the feed entering the A -rich 
phase, q B that entering the D-rich phase (3). Thus, for dilute solution, 

Am B fm n ^

Similarly, p c and q c are the fractions of the C in the feed entering the A- 
and D-rich phases, respectively, so that

The quantity Am/D is the familiar " extraction factor." Consideration

The differential, d(p B pc) /d r^L of Eq. (7.37) when set equal to zero

Illustration 3. Scheibel (15) reports the simultaneous distribution of para (B)- and 
ortho (C)-chloronitrobenzene between the double-solvent pair Skellysolve (a mixture of 
heptanes) (A) and methanol (containing 15% water by volume) (D). When 50 gm. of 
solute was distributed between 250 cu. cm. of each of the solvents, m# = 1.33 and 
me = 0.82, values which are substantially constant with varying ratios of the distributed 
substances. The solvents are substantially immiscible. What will be the solvent-free 
product compositions when 100 Ib. of a mixture containing 33.5% para-, 66.5% ortho- 
chloronitrobenzene are distributed in a single-stage extraction with these solvents to give 
(a) a symmetrical separation and (6) products of equal purity? What quantities of the 
solvents should be used?

Basis: 100 Ib. feed, containing 33.5 Ib. para-, 66.5 Ib. ortho-chloronitrobenzene. The 
A-rich layer will contain 

0.560(33.5) = 18.78 Ib. para; 39.1%, solvent-free. 

0.440(66.5) - 29.3 Ib. ortho; 60.9%, solvent-free.

The J3-rich layer will contain 

33.5 - 18.78 - 14.76 Ib. para; 28.4%, solvent-free. 
66.5 - 29.3 = 37.2 Ib. ortho; 71.6%, solvent-free. 

To be reasonably certain that the distribution data will apply, the solute concentrations 
should approximate those of the experiments, 500 cu. cm. total solvent/50 gm. solute. 

/. (500/50)(100)(454)(1/28,320) = 16 cu. ft. total solvent should be used, of which 
(0.959/1.959)(16) = 7.84 cu. ft. should be heptane.

For the same total solute concentration as in a, 

A + D = 16 
For equal purities,

XBA + XCA XBD H- XCD 

The six equations set the conditions for the problem. Simultaneous solution reveals A to 
be negative, and further study of the equations shows that no real solution is possible 
with any quantity of total solvent. Hence with this feed composition, equal purities 
of products cannot be obtained. 

Batchwise Extraction, Multiple Stage. This operation, usually a labora- 
tory procedure, can be carried out in two ways. The immiscible solvents 
may be continuously pumped through the various stages in countercurrent 
flow, and the batch of mixture to be separated may be suddenly introduced 
near the center of the cascade. The result is an unsteady-state operation, 
the solutes leaving the opposite ends of the cascade in ratios different from 
that in the feed and in amounts varying with time. Such an operation has 
been considered in some detail by Martin and Synge (13) and Cornish 
etal (4). 

On the other hand, the discontinuous batch operation of the type 
described in Fig. 7.13 is more readily carried out. Here the mixture 
(B + C) to be separated is introduced into stage g at the top of the figure, 
together with the immiscible solvents A and D. The A -rich layer resulting 
then passes to stage h to be extracted with additional Z&gt;, the D-rich layer 
to stage j for contacting with additional A, etc. The operation may be 
stopped at any point or may be carried through the diamond-shaped 
arrangement shown. Additional stages may of course be used. The use 
of n portions of each solvent in such an operation can be handled in the 
laboratory with n separating funnels as stages. If n is large, the operations 
are cumbersome at best, and recourse may be had to the ingenious labora- 
tory device fashioned by Craig (5, 8) which permits large numbers of ex- 



222

tractions to be made rapidly with small amounts of solvent, according to 
various arrangements of the stages. The device operates on a principle 
similar to that used in the Cohen-Bruins apparatus for measuring diffusivi-

the upper and lower solvent layers, respectively, are placed in contact; 
shaking the apparatus brings about equilibrium, and after the solvent

Several thorough studies have been made of the discontinuous batch

specting solvent immiscibility and constancy of distribution coefficients 
apply. Further, let the solvents A and D each be divided into n equal 
portions (in the figure, n = 6). If B alone were distributed between the 
solvents, the products from stage g would contain the fraction p B of the 
original B in the A layer, the fraction q B in the D layer, the previous defini- 
tions of p and q still ,-i pph ini If the same distribution occurs in all stages, 
z.e., if m# is constant, then the fraction of B in the A layer from stage h will 
be p B ps or PB, that from stage j will be PBQB, and that from stage m will 
be p B (pBqB + Psqs) = Ip^qs- Similarly the fraction of the original B 
leaving other stages may be calculated. If in addition solute C is simul- 
taneously distributed the same fractions (with C as subscripts) apply to 
solute C.

If the extractions are stopped at a horizontal series of stages in the dia- 
gram, such as at stages a, 6, c, etc., the fractions of each solute in the various 
layers may be calculated from the binomial expansion of (p + q) n . The 
distribution of each solute in the various product layers may then be com- 
pared. For example, suppose we have the symmetrical distribution 
PB = 0.7, q B = 1 - 0,7 = 0.3, p c = 0.3, q c = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7, and n = 6 
as in Fis. 7.13. Ficure 7.14 then shows the fractions of the original solutes

in each of the layers from stages a through/. It is seen that component B 
tends to concentrate in the .4 -rich layers, particularly in that from etage b, 
while component C tends to concentrate in the D layers, especially that 
from stage e. If we define p and q as the fractions of original solute in 
the A- and Z)-rich layers, respectively, after several extractions, then 
PB - PC = 0.2436 for stage 6, and q c - q* = 0.2436 for stage e, the great- 
est values obtained for any single final stage. If the 4 -rich layers of stages 
a through d are composited, p B - PC = 0.6785 - 0.1415 = 0.5370, while 
for stages a through e, p B - pc = 0.7000 - 0.3000 = 0.4000. Similar 
figures result for quantities q? q fl for composited D layers, and these may 
be used as an indication of the degree of separation.

for the JD-rich solutions. With these we can calculate distributions of the 
solutes in the products for this arrangement. As before, if PB = PC = 0.7, 
PC QB = 0.3, and n = 6, the final fractions contain the amounts shown 
in Fig. 7.15. Fractions 3 and 10 show the highest degree of separation for 
any single fractions, PB pc = 0.2147 for fraction 3, qc q/? = 0.2147 
for fraction 10. A composite of all A-rich solutions, fractions 1 through 6, 
shows PB - pc to be 0.9217 - 0.0783 = 0.8434, the same value for q c - q* 
for a composite of all the D-layers of fractions 7 through 12. These show 
not only higher total recoveries of the individual solutes in a single solvent 
but also greater degrees of separation than for the operation which stops at 
the horizontal stages a through/. The sum of the ordinates on either curve 
will equal unity, and if the dividing line for compositing be taken at the 
intersection of the two curves, an over-all measure of the degree of separa- 
tion can be taken as 

sum of fractions of B to the right 
of the intersection of the curves 
+ sum of fractions of C to the left

Degree of separation = ------ ~ - (7.38) 

In the example discussed, this value is 0.9217. 

It should be recalled that the symmetrical separations (PB = qc) just 
described require the ratios of the solvents to be fixed in accordance with 
Eqs. (7.35) or (7.36), and in such cases curves of the type of Fig. 7.15 are 
always mirror images of each other. In other cases, they are lopsided or 
distorted. For example, for m^ = 4.0 and me = 0.735, A/D for a sym- 
metrical separation will be 0.583 [Eq. (7.35)], p B = 0.7 [Eq. (7.29)], and 
the curves of Fig. 7.15 result if n 6. If instead a sol vent ratio A /D = 1.0 
is used, p B = 0.8 [Eq. (7.29)], p c = 0.424 [Eq. (7.30)], and forn = 6 with 
the arrangement of Fig. 7.13, we get the distributions shown in Fig. 7.16. If 
after removal of solvent composites of fractions on either side of the point 
of intersection (i.e., 1 to 4 inclusive, and 5 to 12 inclusive) are made, the 
degree of separation as defined in Eq. (7.38) becomes 0.8919. The sym- 
metrical separation will always result in higher values of the degree of sepa- 
ration than any other, although advantages are sometimes to be found in 
the nonsymmetrical. For example, in the case of Fig. 7.16, compositing 
all D-rich fractions will give C in purer form than for the symmetrical

Estimates of extractions can be made quickly with the assistance of 
Fig. 7.17, which relates the fraction of either solute which has accumulated 
in the composited A -rich layers with the number of stages in a diamond- 
shaped plan. For symmetrical separations, the abscissa for PB is the degree 
of separation as defined by Eq. (7.38).

Refer to Fig. 7.17. At n = 5 (25 stages, arranged as in Fig. 7.13, each solvent divided

This extraction procedure is useful in the laboratory not only for making 
actual separations of mixtures but for analytical purposes as well. For 
example, an unknown mixture can be subjected to a fractionation of the 
arrangement shown in Fig. 7.13 and the total solute content of the final 
fractions determined by weighing the residues after solvent evaporation. 
If a curve plotted from the resulting data, such as the broken curve of Fig. 
7.15, shows two or more peaks, it is first-hand evidence that the original 
solute is a mixture and not pure. Such a curve can provide preliminary 
information for subsequent separation procedures. 

Illustration 6. One gram of a mixture, when fractionated according to the scheme 
of Fig. 7.13 with a solvent ratio A/D = 0.583, gave the broken curve of Fig. 7.15. The 
total solute content of fractions 2 and 3 were 0.2148 gm. and 0.2297 gm., resp. Make a 
first estimate of the distribution coefficient of one of the components of the mixture. 

Solution. Assume the C content of the fractions are negligible, in view of the nature 
of the peaks of the curve.

The curves were originally drawn for m* = 4.0 with this solvent ratio. Similarly me 
could be estimated, and with the help of Fig. 7.17, an extraction procedure to separate 
the mixture more or less completely could be planned. 

Continuous Countercurrent Multistage Fractional Extraction. The in- 
dustrial process utilizing the double-solvent principles is continuous and is 
carried out according to the flowsheet of Fig. 7.18 (2, 15). The feed, con- 
sisting principally of a mixture of B and C to be separated, is introduced 
into the central portion of a cascade of stages, 1' to 1. To facilitate 



MIXED AND DOUBLE SOLVENTS

handling of the feed, it may be mixed with or dissolved in relatively small 
portions of solvents A F and D F . The principal portions of the solvents, 
which may contain dissolved solute remaining from a solvent-recovery 
operation or solute returned as reflux, are introduced into the extremities 
of the cascade as shown and are either substantially immiscible or mutually 
saturated with each other before use.

and A, A' y D, D' are constant from stage to stage. Concentrations of the

FIG. 7.20. Stage construction, component C. 

To determine the number of stages required, the concentrations and 
stage numbers must be matched for both components (15). The concen- 
trations of both B and C are read for each stage from Figs. 7.19 and 7.20, 
and plotted against stage number as in Fig. 7.21. It is a requirement that 
the number of stages to the left of the feed n', and those to the right n, be 
separately identical for both distributed components. Further, the con- 
centrations XB and XG at the feed stage must each be the same when cal- 
culated from either end of the cascade. There is only one set of conditions 
which will meet these requirements, easily located on Fig. 7.21 with a pair 
of draftsman's transparent triangles, as shown. 

The graphical determination of the number of stages is relatively simple 
and avoids trial-and-error calculations for independent distribution coeffi- 



232

cients. If m B and me are constant, the equilibrium curves are straight 
lines. If no solvent is introduced with the feed, the four operating lines 
are all parallel. On the other hand, if the number of stages is fixed and 
final concentrations in the product solutions are to be determined, the 
operating lines must be located by trial to permit fitting the required num- 
ber of stages on the plots. In this latter case, matching of component con- 
centrations is carried out directly on Figs. 7.19 and 7.20. It is important 
that computed concentrations at the feed stage do not exceed the solubility 
limits.

FIG. 7.21. Matching of components at the feed stage. 

For a given total amount of the solvents, the number of stages will be 
fewer if all solvent is introduced at the ends of the cascade rather than 
partly with the feed, since then the slope of the operating lines MN and RS 
will be smaller, and that of the lines PQ and TU greater (Figs. 7.19 and 
7.20).

The number of stages depends upon the per cent recovery and the ratio n'/(n + 1). 
For example, forn'/(n + 1) = 1, and 97% recovery of B,m B A/D = 4.85(0.527) - 2.56, 
and from Fig. 7.26 at p^ = 0.97, ri + n = 7. 

Fractional Extraction with Reflux. Asselin and Comings (1) describe a 
process where the -4-rich solution removed from stage 1 (Fig. 7.18) is split 
into two streams, one of which is withdrawn as product, while the other is 
freed of solvent A by evaporation and the solute taken up by solvent D 
before it enters stage 1 to provide reflux. Similarly, the D-rich phase leav- 
ing stage 1' is split into two streams, one of which is the product while the 
other is freed of solvent by evaporation and the solute taken up by solvent 
A as it enters stage 1'. At stage 1, let r be the fraction of the 4 -rich phase 
whose solute is to be returned as reflux. The reflux ratio is then r/(l r) 
Ib. solute returned per pound solute product. Further, 

x Bo D = rAy Bl , x Co D = rAy Cl (7.59) 

(7 ' 60) 



Equation (7.60) is plotted as a broken straight line on Fig. 7.19, the "reflux" 
line, which passes through the origin and point (XB^B^ and has a slope 
D/rA. Similarly, Eq. (7.61) is a straight line on Fig. 7.20, through the 
origin arid point (xc ,2/d), of slope D/rA. 

At stage 1', if r' is the fraction of the D-rich phase which is to provide 
reflux solute, with a reflux ratio r'/(l r') Ib. solute returned per pound 
withdrawn, then

The slopes of the reflux lines may be either greater or less than those of 
the equilibrium curves, and by adjusting the reflux ratios at either end of 
the cascade it is possible to make M ripping or enriching sections of either 
half of the cascade for either component, B and C. Only a detailed study 
of the equilibria for each system separately can establish the most desirable 
reflux ratios to be used, or indeed whether reflux is at all desirable.

CHAPTER 8 

METHODS OF CALCULATION III. CONTINUOUS COUNTER- 
CURRENT CONTACT 

Instead of bringing the solution to be extracted and the extracting solvent 
into contact in separate stages with intermediate settling, as considered 
in the two preceding chapters, it is also possible to cause them to flow 
countercurrently through a vessel, usually a vertical tower, by virtue of 
their difference in specific gravities. Thus, the solution to be extracted 
may flow downward, if it is the more dense of the two phases, through an 
empty tower, filling it completely, while the lighter solvent may be dis- 
persed in the form of a spray at the bottom, the drops rising through the 
downward flowing raffinate, to be withdrawn at the top. Either phase 
may be made the dispersed phase. Alternatively, various filling materials, 
such as packing similar to that used in gas absorption and distillation 
processes, baffles, and perforated trays, may be installed in the tower to 
increase the turbulence and otherwise affect the flow characteristics. 
Operation is necessarily continuous, and at the same time the two immis- 
cible phases are in continuous contact throughout the length of the appara- 
tus. The cross-sectional area of devices of this sort depends upon the 
quantities of the phases flowing through it. Their height, on the other 
hand, directly influences the extent of extraction occurring, and it is with 
this that we are presently concerned. 

Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Stage. The most obvious method 
for designing continuous contactors of the type described parallels a simple 
procedure introduced many years ago for absorption and distillation proc- 
esses. This involves calculation of the number of ideal or theoretical 
stages n required to bring about a given extraction by the methods of the 
previous chapters, and multiplication of n by a factor, the height equiva- 
lent to a theoretical stage, H.E.T.S., determined from previous experiment 
with the system. Thus, 

H = n(H.E.T.S.) (8.1) 

where H is the height of the tower. Previous experience in the case of 
gas absorption and distillation has proven that fundamentally this method 
is unsound, since it applies a procedure involving stepwise changes in con- 
centration to an operation where the concentration actually changes 
differentially with height. As a result, H.E.T.S. is found to vary widely

with such important operating conditions as type of system, rates of flow, 
and concentration, as well as type of tower used, thus making it necessary 
to have at hand very specific H.E.T.S. data for the contemplated design. 
Theoretically, at least, the methods to be described below alleviate this 
situation considerably, at the expense of a slightly more complex design 
procedure. Practically, until more experimental information is made 
available for the application of the preferred methods, the design procedure 
indicated by Eq. (8.1) is as good as any and is used extensively in practice. 

THE TRANSFER UNIT 

Individual-film Transfer Units. Consider the extraction tower of Fig. 

8.1, where raffinate and extract phases are flowing countercurrently. 

The raffinate phase, or solution to be extracted, enters at a rate Ri moles/hr. 

with a concentration of distributed solute x Rl mole fraction, and leaves at 

a rate #2 with a concentration x Rt . fl 2 is less than R\ by the extent of 
extraction. Similarly, the extracting solvent forming 
the extract phase enters at a rate E 2 moles/hr., un- 
dergoes a concentration change x Ez to XE I} and leaves 
at a rate E\. Alternatively, concentrations in either 
phase may be expressed as weight fractions X, or 
pound moles per cubic foot of solution c. The cross- 
sectional area of the tower is S sq. ft., and the total 
interfacial surface between the phases A sq. ft. Per 
unit volume of tower, the exposed interfacial surface 
is a sq. ft./cu. ft. At some position in the tower 
where raffinate and extract rates are R and E t a 
differential change in concentration of these streams 
occurs over a differential height dH. This change in 
concentration results from the diffusion of distributed 
solute from phase R to phase E because of the con- 
centration gradients discussed in detail in Chap. 5. 
If N is the total transfer of solute, moles per hour, 
then the rate of transfer for the differential section 
can be described by application of Eq. (5.53) to the 
situation at hand (1, 3).

dN = d(Rx R } = k R dAc RM (x R -

where C RM is the average of the values C R and cm. 

Use of this equation limits the resulting relationships 
to cases where solvents are completely immiscible or to relatively dilute 
solutions, since the diffusion upon which Eq. (5.53) is based includes only 
that of the dissolved solute and not those of the solvents. For lack of 
anything better, the equations are nevertheless applied to all situations. 



CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT CONTACT 243 

The total raffinate rate R varies from one end of the tower to the other, 
but the solute-free raffinate, R(l XR), remains constant. Consequently, 



d(Rx a ) = R(l - x s )d j-r^ = Y- R (8.3) 

The mass transfer coefficient k R includes a term (1 XR)*M which varies 
throughout the tower [Eq. (5.52a)]. The quantity k R (l X R ) %M is more 
likely to be constant. In addition, dA = aSdH. Eq. (8.2) may thus 
be modified, 



Since the terms (1 x R ) lM and (1 X R ) are usually nearly unity, the 
left-hand portion of Eq. (8.5) is essentially the concentration change dx R 
experienced per unit of concentration difference (X R x Rl ) causing the 
change, and represents a measure of the difficulty of the extraction. I'his 
in turn is designated as Nt, the number of transfer units, which when multi- 
plied by the experimentally determined factor HTU, the height per transfer 
unit, gives the height of the tower. Thus,

Consideration of Eqs. (8.5) and (8.6) shows that HTU R and the mass- 
transfer coefficient are related : 

HTU R = r TI - . -- = (8.7) 

k R a(l - x ^ } 



In similar fashion, the concentration differences in terms of the extract 
phase might have been used [Eq. (5.53)], which would have resulted in

Over-all Transfer Units. As explained in Chap. 5, the practical diffi- 
culties entering into the use of true equilibrium interfacial concentrations 
x E i and x Rl have led to the introduction of over-all mass-transfer coefficients 
KE and K R , which express the rate of diffusion in terms of over-all concen- 
tration gradients (X R x* R ) and (x* E X E ) [Eqs. (5.57) and (5.59)]. Their 
use requires that the distribution coefficient, 

m = ^ = ^ = 2S (8.10) 



244 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



be truly constant over the range of concentrations encountered in the 
design. This is a serious restriction, and in practice the equations based 
on the over-all concentration gradients are usually used regardless of the 
constancy of m. Applying Eqs. (5.57) and (5.59) to the present situation, 
we obtain

resistance lies in the E phase (m small) . 
To determine the value of N tQK 
or Nt OE , graphical integration of the 
respective expressions is ordinarily re- 
quired, for which in turn operating dia- 
grams of the sort described in Chap. 6 
are prerequisite. Refer to Fig. 8.2 
where there is shown an operating dia- 
gram, including an equilibrium curve 
and operating line, directions for ob- 
taining which have previously been 
described. For any point P on the 
operating line, the vertical distance to 
the equilibrium curve gives the over- 
all concentration difference (x* B X E ), 
while the horizontal distance gives 
(XR X*R). To evaluate N tOR , either 

or the quantity 



CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT CONTACT 245 

is calculated for as many points on the operating line as required to give a 
smooth curve when plotted against XR. The area under the resulting 
curve between the limits XR^ and XR t is the required value. N toE may be 
obtained in a similar manner. Equations (8.6) and (8.8) could be evaluated 
in the same fashion also, if the position of points corresponding to Q could 
be located. 

Simplified Graphical Integration. Considerable effort has been put into 
the problems of reducing the tedium of the graphical integration for N tQR 
and Nt OE . Thus, if (1 XR) and (1 XR) differ by no more than a factor 
of 2, an arithmetic average rather than a logarithmic average for (1 XR)OM 
incurs an error of 1.5 per cent at the most (8). Thus, 

(1 - XR)OM = -"**) + (1 ~ x *&gt; (8.15) 

and substitution in Eq. (8.11) leads to 

f XR t rlr 1 T

Similarly, 

N tQE = / -n h Hla * - (8.17) 

Jxff t XE ~~ XE 1 XE^ 

and graphical integration is made of a curve of l/(x R x* R ) vs. X R for Nt OR . 
Weight fractions are usually more convenient than mole fractions, since 
the triangular equilibrium diagrams from which the operating diagrams 
are plotted use this unit most frequently. Thus, 



where r is the ratio of molecular weights of nonsolute to solute. Substi- 
tution in Eqs. (8.11) and (8.13) leads to results which are too awkward to 
use directly, but if the arithmetic rather than logarithmic average is used 
for (1 X)OM, there is obtained (2)

Weight ratios, w = X/(l X), are sometimes convenient since the operat- 
ing line on the operating diagram is then frequently a straight line. Sub- 
stitution in Eqs. (8.11) and (8.13) leads to (2)

where the right-hand parts of the preceding equations include an approxi- 
mation equivalent to that of Eq. (8.15). Mole-ratio-concentration units 
lead to equations identical with Eqs. (8.21) and (8.22) with the exception 
that r is omitted. 

Further simplification can be introduced by evaluation of the integrals 
of Eqs. (8.16) to (8.22) formally rather than graphically. This can be 
accomplished with more or less precision depending on the validity of the 
assumptions necessary to permit formal integration. The various con- 
ditions and the results may be outlined as follows: 

1. Dilute Solutions, ra Constant (1, 2, 3). For dilute solutions, (1 XR) 
and (1 X E ) are nearly unity, and R and E are substantially constant. 
A material balance over the lower portion of the tower of Fig. 8.1 then 
becomes approximately 

R(XR - x Rz ) - E(x E - x E j (8.23) 

Substitution of mx* R for X E and rearrangement leads to 

xl - &lt;*. - **) + f (8.24) 

This may be substituted in the integral of Eq. (8.16), and the integral 
evaluated: 




In a similar manner, 

p _^_ = _1 ln FA _ mM/x^jn^A ml (g 26) 

J XjSt XE - x E 1 _ mE l\ R /\x E , - mx R J R J ' 

R 

Since in practice there are always slight variations in m, E, and R, some- 
what more precise results are obtained by using values of these quantities 
at the dilute end of the system (m^ E^ and 72 2 ), since the transfer units are 
ordinarily concentrated at this end. Equations (8.25) and (8.26) may also 
be used for the integrals of Eqs. (8.19) and (8.20) provided that X is 
substituted for x, m is defined in terms of X, and E and R are expressed 
in weights per unit time; they may be used for the integrals of Eqs. (8.21) 
and (8.22) if to is substituted for x, m is defined in terms of w y and E and R 
are the weights of the solute-free streams per unit time. A convenient 
graphical solution is provided in Fig. 8.3.

2. More Concentrated Solutions, m = Constant for Dilute Solutions. 

Colburn (2) has assumed (a) that m may be constant for dilute solutions, 
whereupon (x* E X E ), for example, is a linear function of (mxR XE), 
and (6) that for more concentrated solutions (x% X E ) is a function of 
(mx R x E ). 2 By dividing the total extraction into two parts, when each 
assumption is likely to apply separately, and combining the results, he 
was able to obtain the following approximations :

Equations (8.27) and (8.28) may be used as well for the integrals of Eqs. 
(8.19) to (8.22) by substitution of the proper units, as explained in (1) 
above. The graphical solution of Fig. 8.3 is also applicable. The equa- 
tions are satisfactory only for cases where the number of transfer units is 
large (where the value of the abscissa of Fig. 8.3 exceeds approximately 
120) and where # 2 /W?2 [in the case of Eq. (8.27)] or mJE^/R^ [in the case 
of Eq. (8.28)] do not exceed approximately 0.75. 

3. More Concentrated Solutions, m Varies Linearly with X R . Scheibel 
and Othmer (5) have evaluated the integrals for this case, and show the 
results to be applicable to a wide variety of siutations. Their results may 
be expressed as follows:

For cases where equilibrium curve and operating line are very close at the 
dilute end of the column, with a concentration of transfer units at the end, 
ra 2 should be the true slope of the equilibrium curve at X R and m^ that of 
the reciprocal of the slope at XE*. Other corrections for handling cases 
of more complicated curvature of equilibrium and operating lines are dis- 
cussed in detail by Scheibel and Othmer (5). Graphical solutions of 
Eqs. (8.29) and (8.30) are available (5, 6), and the equations may be ap- 
plied to the integrals of Eqs. (8.19) to (8.22) by the substitution of the 
proper units, as outlined in (1) above. 

The formal integrations just discussed will be more successful if that for 
N tQR is used in the case of countercurrent extraction without reflux. If 
reflux is used, N tQR should be calculated for the stripping section, N tOB 
for the enriching section. 



MASS-TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS 

The mass-transfer coefficients can be used directly for design, without 
resort to the HTU, if desired, by integration of their defining equations. 
Thus, adapting Eq. (5.59) to the present situation, we have 

dN = K R aS(c R c*x)dH = K R aSc R M(x R x* R ) (8.31) 

where the over-all coefficient is defined as K R a, the o-term being ordinarily 
incapable of separate evaluation.

Thus, the height H may be evaluated by graphical integration either of a

against X R , in both cases obtaining the necessary data from operating dia-

The equations may be written also for the individual-film mass-transfer 
coefficients k R a and k E a, using individual-film concentration gradients. 

If the solutions are very dilute and the distribution coefficient and mass- 
transfer coefficients may be considered constant, formal integration of the 
equations may be carried out as in the case of transfer units. For such a 
situation,

OVER-ALL AND HO)IVIDUAL-FILM DIFFUSIONAL RESISTANCES 

It is useful to establish the relationship between the over-all diffusional 
resistances generally used in design and those of the individual films. 
We have already seen the relationship in terms of mass-transfer coefficients 
in Chap. 5, and Eq. (5.62), adapted to the use of mole-fraction units for m, 
becomes 

__ I C#a,v XQ 4o\ 



K R a 

Multiplying through by R/[8(l - x R ) OM c Rn ], each term contains the essen- 
tials of the definitions of the various HTU's, and we obtain (3) 

= HTU R % " x *\* + (^-} HTU E % ~ ^ (8.44) 
- - 



In the special case that the principal diffusional resistance lies in the R 
phase, (1 X R \ M = (1 - XR] OM , and (1 - x E ) tM = (1 - XE). Equation 
(8.44) becomes 



= HTU R + HTV E n ~ * (8.45) 

\mE/ (1 XR) OM 

If in addition the solutions are dilute, 

HTUoR = HTU R + (~~) HTU E (8.46) 

By a similar process, we can arrive at 

= HTU E + fer\ HTU R (8.47) 



for dilute solutions, and the principal resistance in the E phase. These 
equations are useful, particularly in experimental work, in indicating the 
controlling importance the group mE/R, the extraction factor, has in 
establishing the location of the principal resistance. Although HTUe 
and HTU R are not constant with varying rates of flow, if we assume that 
they are of the same order of magnitude, increasing the size of the extrac- 
tion factor places the principal diffusional resistance in the R phase, while 
decreasing its size places the principal resistance in the E phase. 

The extraction factor, which is essentially the ratio of the slope of the 
equilibrium curve to that of the operating line, has additional economic 
significance in establishing the conditions of design. We have seen (Chap. 
6) that for a countercurrent extraction, a value of mE/R less than unity 
definitely limits the extent of extraction even with an infinite number of 
stages or transfer units. For reduction of the concentration of the solute 
in the final raffinate to a low value, mE/R must exceed unity. From Fig- 
8.3, it is clear that the greater the value of mE/R, the fewer will be the num- 
ber of transfer units required for a given degree of extraction, with con- 



252 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



sequently lesser costs for the extraction equipment. On the other hand, 
most extraction operations must be followed by solvent-recovery processes, 
and with large values of mE/R the extract solution becomes very dilute 
and solvent recovery is costly. It follows that there will be an optimum 
value of mE/R for any process, dependent upon the value of the solute 
being extracted and a variety of other costs, but very likely in the neighbor- 
hood of 1.5 to 2.0 (1). Unfortunately for the designer, this is in the range 
of extraction factors where both film resistances are of importance and the 
use of over-all HTU's or mass-transfer coefficients under these conditions, 
without true constancy of m or the individual film resistances, becomes the 
more risky. 7

CHAPTER 9 
EQUIPMENT FOR STAGEWISE CONTACT 

The various types of equipment for liquid extraction may be classified 
into two main categories: 

1. Those which provide discrete stages, where the liquids are mixed, ex- 
traction is allowed to occur, and the insoluble phases are settled and sepa- 
rately removed. At best, the insoluble phases are hi equilibrium, and the 
performance represents that of one ideal or theoretical stage. For results 
corresponding to the multistage flowsheets of Chaps. 6 and 7, multiple 
units each providing mixing, settling, and separation must be joined. 

2. Those which provide continuous countercurrent contact between the 
insoluble phases. The equivalent of as many theoretical stages may be 
built into a single piece of equipment as is desired or is practical, without 
intermediate removal of the phases. Design calculations are described in 
Chap. 8. 

A few of the latter types combine features of both categories. Only the 
first will be considered in this chapter. 

The discrete stage must provide each of the functions listed in 1 above. 
It is convenient to classify the equipment accord ing to method of operation 
as follows: 

1 . Batch operation 

a. The mixer provides a substantially uniform dispersion of the two 
liquid phases throughout the mixing vessel, if well designed' 

b. Settling of the phases and their separation may occur in the mix- 
ing vessel after agitation is stopped or in a separate vessel 

2. Continuous operation. Mixing and phase separation must be carried 
out in separate vessels 

a. The mixer provides mixing in the direction of forward flow, with 

substantially uniform dispersion 

fe. The mixer does not provide mixing in the direction of forward flow 
("in-line" mixing). The composition of the phases varies with 
position in the mixer in the direction of flow 

The design of such equipment then requires study of the two major types of 
mixers and separators. These are considered separately. 

AGITATED VESSELS 

Mixers which provide substantially uniform dispersion throughout are 
represented by the many types of agitated vessels. Agitation might be 



258 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

provided by rocking or shaking the entire vessel, by bubbling of a gas 
through the vessel contents, or by circulating the contents from the bottom 
of the vessel to the top externally by means of a pump. None of these 
methods is satisfactory industrially, and invariably some form of mechani- 
cal internal agitation is necessary. The design of agitators involves con- 
sideration of the power requirements and the adequacy of mixing. It is 
only in the last few years that systematic study has been given the former, 
and very little has been done with the latter. It seems well established that 
high power absorption by an agitator is not necessarily accompanied by 
adequate mixing. 

If the mixing vessel is inadequately agitated, the two insoluble liquids 
will settle out vertically owing to their difference in density. On the other 
hand, strong circular motion about the axis of the vessel may cause strati- 
fication by centrifugal force, with the heavy liquid collecting in a layer 
around the tank wall. It is clear, therefore, that for adequate mixing the 
agitator must produce both vertical motion of the liquids to offset the first 
tendency and radial motion to prevent the second. While adequacy of 
mixing and dispersion is obviously essential to provide rapid extraction, it 
is most important that difficultly settleable emulsions do not result. The 
nature of the circulation produced in an agitated vessel is influenced by 
tank shape, the presence of stationary objects immersed in the liquid such 
as baffles, and impeller design, location, and speed (9). The degree of 
dispersion which results from a given mechanical , -mm norm -m depends 
upon the properties of the tank contents, including density and viscosity 
of each phase, interfacial tension, and the relative amounts of the two 
phases. 

Mixing Tanks. The tank, used for the mixer is ordinarily a vertical 
cylinder with a smooth internal surface, except for baffles, preferably fitted 
with a dished bottom. Flat-bottomed, square, or rectangular tanks are 
much less effective (3, 9). The minimum limits for the ratio of liquid 
depth to tank diameter for adequate circulation has been considered in some 
detail (8), but for best results the liquid depth should be at least equal to or 
somewhat greater than the tank diameter. 

Baffles. For the most effective circulation within the tank, swirl and 
vortices must be avoided, since the circular flow associated with swirl is 
not accompanied by the necessary vertical motion. Except in the case of 
extremely viscous liquids (viscosity &gt; 60,000 centipoises) . or where marine 
propellers are used in an off-center arrangement, vortices will invariably 
develop with any impeller, and properly arranged baffles are thoroughly 
effective in eliminating them. 

Vertical baffles are narrow, flat strips placed vertically along the walls of 
the mixer tank, most commonly ,.i:;.: u'-i radially, less frequently at an 
angle to the tank radius. They may be welded or otherwise fastened

directly to the tank wall, or set out from the wall 0.5 to 1.5 in., and should 
preferably extend for the full liquid depth as in Fig. 9. la. In the case of 
turbine impellers, it is particularly important that baffles be available in 
the zone directly opposite the turbine (9). The work of Mack and Kroll 
(39) has established minimum baffle conditions which produce a " fully 
baffled state," where swirl is negligible and beyond which additional baffling 
produces no very great advantage. Four equally spaced vertical baffles, 
arranged radially, of length equal to the liquid depth and width equal 
to 34 o r ^12 of the tank diameter provide this condition.

Stator ring baffles, used in conjunction with turbine- type impellers, 
consist of a series of blades ;.ri i ,:nni -i on a circular ring mounted in the plane 
of the turbine, as in Fig. 9.16. The inner diameter is slightly larger than 
that of the turbine, the outer diameter usually in the neighborhood of one- 
half that of the tank. The results produced by these are basically different 
from those produced by vertical baffles, and they serve to develop sub- 
stantially complete radial flow of the liquid (38). Much higher local tur- 
bulence and shear result than with vertical baffles, and care must be ex- 
ercised in their use with liquids having a tendency to form emulsions. 

Draft tubes are cylindrical sleeves placed axially either at the level of a 
marine propeller or above a turbine impeller. For most mixing operations 
of the type considered here, they provide nothing that cannot be made 
available through baffling (38). 

Impellers. With the exception of a few special designs, impellers may 
be classified according to the type of flow they induce: tangential (paddle 



260 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



type), axial (propellers), and radial (turbines). The paddle type produces 
poor circulation and is not recommended for the purposes at hand. 

Propellers. These are the most economical impellers for mixing low- 
viscosity liquids in small tanks (38). Marine types, with two, three, or 
four blades are usually used, three blades most commonly (Fig. 9.2a).

They are rotated in such a manner as to cause downward flow against the 
bottom of the tank, at speeds usually in the range 100 to 1,000 r.p.m., 
depending upon the diameter and pitch of the propeller and the nature of 
the liquids being mixed. The shaft is ordinarily mounted along the axis of 
the tank, entering from the top, although off-centered entrance at an angle 
is sometimes used to avoid vortexing without baffles. Bottom steady 
bearings and auxiliary bearings for eliminating shaft vibration are undesir- 
able and can usually be avoided (9).

Turbines. For the most difficult mixing operations, particularly for 
large quantities of liquids, the " back-sloped " or centrifugal turbine, Fig. 
9.26, is most efficient. The blades may or may not be confined between 
flat peripheral plates. Simpler radial-type blades are also used, with blades 
- attached either directly to the hub or to a horizontal disk as in Fig. 9.2d,e. 
The pitched-blade turbine, Fig. 9.2c, is popular, since it combines the action 
of both propeller and radial-bladed 
turbines, although neither action is 
as well developed as with these de- 
vices separately. For continuous 
operation, comparttnented vessels 
such as that shown in Fig. 9.3 may 
be used conveniently with turbine 
impellers, to reduce the short-circuit- 
ing that may result with a single ves- 
sel. Here the holes in the plates 
which separate the compartments are 
sufficiently large to permit removal 
of the impellers for maintenance, 
and rotating plates attached to the 
shaft reduce the flow area between 
compartments to prevent excessive 
short-circuiting (9). Each compart- 
ment may be baffled with vertical or 
stator ring baffles. 

The diameters of impellers of either 
the propeller or turbine type are or- 
dinarily one-third the diameter of the mixing tank. They are usually 
placed between one impeller diameter above the bottom and a similar dis- 
tance below the liquid surface, the lower position preferred. 

Power for Agitation. In recent years, considerable study has been given 
the power requirements for agitation, particularly of single-phase liquids. 
It has been well established that the power varies as the cube of the speed 
for fully developed turbulence, so that one measurement of power for a 
given mixer and liquid will permit prediction of the power at any speed. 
Reasonably successful correlation of power for agitation under geometrically 
similar conditions has been made by relating the dimensionless group 
= Pg/PS 2 n to a modified Reynolds number, Re = 
where P = power 

I = impeller diam.

all in consistent units. Alternatively, a power coefficient, Pg/PS 3 p = &lt;t&gt;/Re, 
has been used for correlating purposes and for characterizing impellers. 
The work of Miller and Mann (46) and Olney and Carlson (52) has estab- 
lished that power data for two-liquid-phase mixtures can be correlated with 
those of single liquids provided that an average density and viscosity for 
the mixture are used, as follows: 

P = ZEPE + ZRPR (9.1) 



where z = the volume fraction of the appropriate phase, although as 
Miller and Mann point out, an increased viscosity due to emulsion forma- 
tion may be developed at high ngitntion intensities which cannot be esti- 
mated by Eq. (9.2). Olney and Carlson (52) and Hooker (29) have made 
beginnings in establishing generalized power correlations for many types of 
unbaffled agitators, using both single- and two-liquid-phase data, although 
their correlations must be considered tentative. 

Power measurements on several two-liquid-phase systems have been 
made by Olney and Carlson (52) using an arrowhead turbine agitator with 
vertical baffles and a centrifugal turbine with a stator ring baffle. The 
effectiveness of mixing was not considered. The arrowhead-type turbine 
is not now recommended for such service (41). 

Mixing Effectiveness. Miller and Mann (46) studied power requirements 
of seven types of impellers in unbaffled vessels and mixing effectiveness for 
several systems using a special sampling technique. The effectiveness of 
mixing was expressed as a mixing index, defined as the average ratio of the 
volume fraction of the phase in which the sample is poor to the volume 
fraction of that phase in the vessel as a whole. The index then provides 
some measure of the uniformity of dispersion throughout the vessel, al- 
though it does not measure the fineness of subdivision. Their results for 
kerosene-water in an unbaffled tank may be summarized as follows: 
(a) mixing index increased with power input per unit volume generally 
to a maximum at 200 ft. Ib./min. (cu. ft.), whereupon it either dropped or 
leveled off with further increase of power; (6) a four-bladed radial turbine 
and a four-bladed pitched turbine deflecting downward performed best, 
while a two-bladed propeller was poorest; the performance of all seven types 
of agitators was surprisingly similar, with mixing indexes ranging up to 0.8 
and 0.9 for most; (c) impellers operate best if the interface between the 
phases when at rest is above the impeller; (d) measurements on the effect 
of liquid depth were not conclusive; (e) performance depends upon the 
tendency to form oil-in-water or water-in-oil dispersions. Measurements 
with other oils and water indicated that power input varies almost directly 
with density at the same mixing index, but the effect of viscosity was not 
clearly established. This study of the relation between power and mixing 



EQUIPMENT FOR STAGEWISE CONTACT 



263 



effectiveness is the most complete available but should be projected to other 
systems with considerable caution because of the lack of baffling and the 
lack of information concerning the effect of interfacial tension. 

Some indication of the effect of interfacial tension on mixing effectiveness 
is provided by the data of Hunter (30), who contacted lubricating oil with 
nitrobenzene in laboratory separatory funnels which were air-agitated. 
The effectiveness of extraction appears to be best at oil: sol vent ratios 
which tend to give complete miscibility, conditions which correspond to 
low values of interfacial tension.

Rate of Extraction. Batch Agitators. Consider the batch extraction of 
a solute from a raffinate phase by an extract phase in an agitated vessel. 
At zero time, the concentration of solute in the raffinate phase is c#, in the 
extract phase c E . As time passes and extraction proceeds, the concentra- 
tion in the extract phase will increase, that in the raffinate will decrease, 
until eventually equilibrium values in each phase, CE Pq and CR eq, are 
reached. We may express the concentration of solute in the raffinate at 

time as 



CE = rnc R (9.3) 

where m is the distribution coefficient, in the manner of Chap. 5 [Eq. (5.56)], 
and indicate the variation of concentration with time graphically as in 
Fig. 9.4. Letting N the number of moles of solute extracted and A the

different procedure and tested by extraction of iodine from water with 
carbon tetrachloride in a series of unbaffled geometrically similar vessels 
using marine propellers as agitators. Plotting (1 N/N^) against time 
on semilogarithmic graph paper yielded straight lines from which the con- 
stant K' could be determined. K r was found to vary with speed to a power 
ranging from 3.8 to 5 depending upon propeller height and with diameter of 
the mixing vessel. Failure to obtain a correlation between K', vessel 
diameter, and propeller position is explained by Rushton (53) as being 
caused by the lack of kinematic and dynamic similarity in the unbaffled 
vessel. Intcrfacial tension probably enters as an important variable 
where vortex and swirl are produced, and dynamic similarity would require 
the use of different liquids in unbaffled vessels of different sizes. 

The general applicability of an equation of the form of Eq. (9.8) was also 
confirmed for two-liquid-phase systems on a very small scale by Yates and 
Watson (61), who extracted acetic acid from a very dilute water solution 
by kerosene in agitated laboratory beakers. 

Rate of Extraction. Continuous Extraction. Extraction by mixing 
liquids in an agitated vessel with continuous flow will generally be less 
effective than by a batch process, since it can be shown from Eq. (9.8) that 
in the batch process the average concentration-difference driving force is 
the logarithmic mean between that at the beginning and that at the end 
of the process. In the uniformly mixed continuous agitator, on the other 
hand, the driving force is that corresponding to the withdrawn products 
(17). Assuming flow through a continuous mixer in a direction parallel 
to the axis of the mixer, and assuming thorough mixing in a direction 
perpendicular to the axis of the tank but none in the direction of flow 
(an "in-line" mixer with perfect displacement), the continuous process 
should behave in the manner of a batch process. This situation can be 
approached as nearly as desired by using several agitated vessels in series 
for the continuous process, as exemplified by the compartmented vessel 
of Fig. 9.3. 

Macmullin and Weber (40) have investigated this situation mathemati- 
cally and found that for agitated vessels with uniform dispersion of the 
liquids throughout,

where for example the form of Eq. (9.16) might not be followed, graphical 
solution of Eq. (9.20) may be used. Such predictions of efficiency should 
of course be used with considerable caution because of the assumptions of 
uniform dispersion and of the absence of an effect on the flow regime in the 
vessel when changing from batch to continuous operation.

FLOW MIXERS 

Flow mixers, or "in-line" mixers, are devices for bringing about continu- 
ous dispersion of one liquid in another while the previously proportioned 
phases are flowing through the apparatus. They differ from continuously 
operated agitated vessels in that they have small volumes and consequently 
provide very little holding time for diffusion to occur. Their use is or- 
dinarily limited to cases where dispersion is not difficult and where equi- 
librium is rapidly obtained, such as in the case of liquids of low viscosity 
(less than 100 centipoises) . They have been widely used in the refining 
of light petroleum distillates, where the ratio of quantity of solvent or treat- 
ing liquid to that of liquid to be treated is small. There are four basic 
types: 

1. Jets, or devices depending upon impingement of one liquid upon the 
other for intimacy of mixing. 

2. Injectors, where the flow of one of the liquids is induced by the flow 
of the other, at the same time resulting in mixing. 

3. Orifices and nozzles, which bring about mixing and dispersion by caus- 
ing a high degree of turbulence in the stream of the flowing liquids. 

4. Devices depending upon mechanical agitation. 

These devices are all relatively inexpensive in first cost and will bring about 
a fairly coarse dispersion economically. Intimate mixing requires fairly 
great expenditure of pressure drop, however, and consequently they may be 
expensive to operate. 

Jets. These are ordinarily the least satisfactory of the flow mixers for 
bringing about intimate mixing of two immiscible liquids, although they 
are successful in mixing gases. Their use in extraction is limited to liquids

of low density difference and interfacial tension, where more efficient mixers 
might cause emulsification. In its simplest form, the jet mixer consists 
merely of pipes connected in the form of a F, where the two liquids are 
pumped separately into the branches to flow out together through the stem. 
More positive breakup of one of the liquids seems almost essential, however.

The Barber jet described by Hunter and Nash (31), the essentials of which 
are indicated in Fig. 9.8a, disperses one liquid into the other by pumping 
it through a number of tangent ially arranged orifices in the inner concentric 
tube. The action of a simple jet is further improved by supplementing it 
with mixing nozzles or orifices of the type described below (13, 30), for ex- 
ample as in Fig. 9.86. There are substantially no data available on the 
performance of such jets, with the exception of an indication by Hunter 
(30) that in the removal of phenol from an oil with aqueous alkali, a par- 
ticular jet brought about between 90 and 100 per cent removal of phenol 
over a range of flow rates of approximately 200 to 1,000 gal./hr.

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



One variety of mixer, Fig. 9.9, which can be considered to fall in this 
category has been eminently successful in providing the initial mixing of 
oil and solvents in the Duo-Sol process for refining lubricating oils (45).

Solvent-rich solution enters the larger nozzle and flows through the perfora- 
tions at velocities of 16 to 20 ft. /sec. The oil enters the smaller nozzle and, 
as it spirals around the perforated cone, is thoroughly mixed with solvent. 
The mixture leaves at the top, as shown. 

Injectors. These devices operate in principle in the manner of the 
familiar steam injector, the flow of one liquid which is pumped through the 
device inducing the flow of, and admixture with, the other liquid. The

mass velocity of the added liquid must be several times that of the main 
liquid if adequate mixing is to occur (60). One type (24) which has been 
used is shown in Fig. 9.10a, where the injector is incorporated into the 
settling chamber of the stage. The chamber is filled with a settled mixture 
pf the two insoluble liquids, with the interface roughly at the center.

Heavy liquid from a previous stage is pumped into the injector as shown, 
thus inducing the flow of light liquid from the settled mixture in the 
chamber. Mixing occurs in the tapered tube leading from the throat of the 
injector, and the dispersion is discharged through a slit in the wall of the 
chamber into the adjoining chamber for settling. 
Figure 9.10&amp; shows a similar arrangement but with 
the injector mounted externally, and others of the 
same principle are also possible (44, 56). Such de- 
vices thus require only one pump per stage. The 
basic principles have been recently reviewed by 
Folsom (20), but no data are available on their 
effectiveness in mixing immiscible liquids. Morrell 
and Bergman (50) indicate that they operate well 
provided that approximately equal quantities of 
the two liquids are being handled. 

In the early installations of the Duo-Sol process 
for lubricating oil refining, injector mixers similar 
to those described above were used for mixing the 
insoluble liquid phases between adjacent stages, 
but it was found that the mixing which resulted 
was too thorough to permit settling in a reasonable 
time for the low interfacial tension encountered. 
In more recent plants for this process, the liquids 
are merely pumped through 10 or 15 ft. of piping 
between stages at velocities in the range from 
10 to 16 ft. /sec., which results in sufficient turbu- 
lence to provide adequate mixing (45). 

Nozzles and Orifices. Nozzle mixers are rela- 
tively simple devices which can be installed in pipe 
lines, as shown in Fig. 9.11. The two liquids are 
pumped simultaneously through the nozzle, or through several in series, 
the mixing depending upon the development of a high degree of turbulence 
at the expense of the pressure of the liquids entering the nozzle. Orifice 
mixers, Fig, 9.12, operate on the same principle and have been very widely 
used in the refining of light petroleum distillates. The typical orifice 
column as used in the petroleum refinery consists of 20 to 30 orifice plates 
in a pipe line, usually set 12 in. apart (14, 50). The orifice plates contain a 
number of circular holes, 1.5 to 2.0 in. in diameter, sufficient to produce a 
pressure drop in the neighborhood of 2 Ib./sq. in. for each plate as estimated 
by ordinary standard orifice equations (50). The velocity of the liquids 
through the pipe cross section should be fairly low, less than 1 ft,/sec., in 
order to provide some holding time for diffusion to occur. A " knothole" 
mixer, containing orifices in the shape of a 12-pointed star (62), has been

used, but this seems an unnecessary complication. The orifice plates may 
be bolted between flanges, welded on a rod which is then introduced into the 
pipe, or welded into slots cut in the pipe. Construction is simple and in- 
expensive. A modification, shown in Fig. 9.13, has been used successfully

in petroleum work. If interfacial tension is low, as in the presence of sur- 
face active agents, even simpler devices will serve. For example, pumping 
petroleum-salt-water mixtures through a standard globe valve was sufficient 
in one case to produce such intimate mixing that difficultly separable 
emulsions resulted (25). 

Centrifugal Pumps. These have been used as mixers in extraction work, 
although their field of applicability is small. In the ordinary arrangement, 
the two liquids to be mixed are fed to the suction side of the pump, and the 
action of the impeller provides the dispersion; at the same time the liquids 
are pumped to the settler which follows. If the interfacial tension and 
density difference are low, the violence of the impeller action is quite likely 
to produce an emulsion, while if the density difference is large, stratification

with little mixing may result from the strong centrifugal action. Morrell 
and Bergman (50) suggest pumping the liquids backwards through a cen- 
trifugal pump which has had its impeller reduced in diameter. No system- 
atic data are available on performance; Gollmar (22, 23) indicates that 
they are successful in contacting a mix- 
ture of light oil and aqueous gas-works 
ammonia liquor for removal v of phenols. 

Figure 9.14 shows a device (16) which 
uses turbulence developed both by orifices 
and agitators to bring about mixing. It 
has been used successfully in the treat- 
ment of gasoline with caustic soda solu- 
tions. The Stratford mixer (58), which 
incorporates similar principles, has been 
successfully used in acid treatment of 
light petroleum distillates and lubricating 
oils and subsequent neutralization with 
caustic solutions. 

Baffles. Baffle mixers have frequently 
been used in conjunction with each of 
the flow-mixer types described above to 
provide longer contact time in the dis- 
persed condition with relatively little ex- 
penditure of power. They are essentially 
orifice mixers with the orifices replaced by segmental baffles, the opening 
representing J^ to % of the cross-sectional area of the pipe in which they 
are installed, and they are placed downstream from the mixer. The more 
moderate turbulence they create will frequently maintain a dispersion 
sufficiently well to permit rapid extraction. Alternatively, the downstream 
pipe may be filled with tower packing such as Raschig rings to accomplish 
the same purpose (10, 30, 50). 

EMULSIONS 

The mixture of immiscible liquids resulting from agitation or mixing are 
dispersions of one liquid in a continuum of another. It is customary to 
speak of these as "water-in-oil" or "oil-in-water" emulsions, referring to 
whether water or oil, respectively, forms the dispersed phase. Even 
though there may be no aqueous phase present in an extraction process, it 
is convenient to use this designation to describe the liquids in what follows. 
The conditions controlling the formation of one type or the other have been 
the object of considerable study. Since closely paqked spheres of uniform 
size occupy approximately 74 per cent of the total space, it was long con- 
sidered that emulsions cannot exist which contain more than 74 per cent 




FIG. 9.14. Agitated mixer (16). (Cour- 
tesy, New England Tank and Tower Co.) 



274 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

by volume of the dispersed phase. Thus, to 26 volume per cent water 
would produce water-in-oil emulsions, 74 to 100 per cent oil-in-water, with 
both possible in the range from 26 to 74 per cent. Other factors of great 
importance influence these proportions, however. The dispersed droplets 
are ordinarily not uniform in size, nor need they necessarily be perfect 
spheres. High viscosity of one of the liquids favors its forming the con- 
tinuous phase. The presence of an emulsifying substance, or surface active 
agent, is of great influence, and it is generally recognized that the liquid in 
which the emulsifying agent is soluble has the greater tendency to form the 
continuous phase. In the absence of emulsifiers, however, it is known that 
oil-in-water emulsions form more readily with low volumetric ratios of oil 
to water, and vice versa, and that inversion or change from one phase dis- 
persed to the other will frequently occur on dilution of an emulsion with the 
continuous phase. Occasionally dual emulsions, where the continuous 
phase is also present as very small droplets dispersed in the drops of the 
other, result from partial or arrested inversion. Dilution of a sample of an 
emulsion will usually indicate to which type it belongs: an emulsion will mix 
readily with more of continuous phase, with difficulty with additional dis- 
persed phase. 

Stability of Emulsions. From the point of view of liquid-extraction 
operations, the stability or permanence of a dispersion is its most important 
property since it is necessary to separate the phases at each extraction stage. 
In order for an emulsion to "break," or separate into its phases in bulk, both 
sedimentation and coalescence of the droplets of the dispersed phase must 
occur. 

The velocity of rise or fall of isolated liquid drops immersed in another 
liquid was studied by Bond and Newton (11), who showed that

all in consistent units. The quantity in the first set of brackets is the 
familiar Stokes' law for rigid spheres. It was shown that for large drops, 
ra/W is small and the Stokes' law correction becomes 

1 + O 



EQUIPMENT FOR STAGEWISE CONTACT 275 

which in turn reaches a maximum value of % when MD/MC is small. For 
small drops, r&lt;r/W is large, the correction factor approaches unity, and 
Stokes' law becomes directly applicable. The interfacial tension becomes 
of importance when ra/W is approximately unity, although the precise 
nature of the interfacial tension function was not determined. Equation 
(9.22) cannot be applied directly to settling of emulsions since coalescence 
may vary the value of r and because of the close crowding of the drops. It 
does indicate, however, that settling will be slower the greater the viscosity 
of the continuous phase, the smaller the density difference, and the smaller 
the drop size. Most stable emulsions are characterized by maximum 
particle diameters of the order of 1 to 1.5 microns (6), while diameters of 
the order of 1 mm. produce relatively coarse dispersions which settle fairly 
readily (30). The method of agitation may have an influence on the par- 
ticle size. For example, Herschel (26) and Hunter and Nash (32) found, 
in agitating certain oils and aniline with water, that with increasing speed 
of agitation the rate of settling of the resulting dispersions at first decreased, 
passed through a minimum, and then increased. Similarly, Moore (47) 
noted that the size of the dispersed drops of a kerosene-aqueous ammonium 
chloride emulsion stabilized with lampblack passed through a minimum as 
the time of stirring was increased, and Rushton (54) has observed a critical 
speed of mixing above which emulsions of water-benzene, water-toluene, 
water-xylene, and water-methyl isopropyl ketone settled more rapidly. 

The only factor causing coalescence is interfacial tension, whereas several 
oppose it (6, 7). Ordinarily, the greater the interfacial tension, the greater 
the tendency to coalesce. Interfacial tension will be low for liquids of 
high mutual solubility and will be lowered by the presence of emulsifying 
agents. High viscosity of the continuous phase hinders coalescence by 
decreasing the rate at which the thin film between drops is removed. The 
formation of tough interfacial films by substances such as certain proteins 
and other emulsifying agents may prevent coalescence. The presence of 
minute dust particles, which generally accumulate at the interface when 
dispersed in two-liquid-phase systems, can prevent coalescence. Certain 
dispersions are characterized by an electric charge on the droplets, which 
are then mutually repelled and cannot coalesce. The emulsion will be 
stable should the combined effects of all of these be stronger than the 
coalescent tendency of interfacial tension; practically, the presence of an 
emulsifying agent is almost always necessary for stability. 

Stable emulsions must be avoided in liquid extraction, since their destruc- 
tion requires removal or counteraction of the emulsifying agent responsible 
for their stability. 

Unstable Emulsions. Meissner and Chertow (43) have given an excellent 
description of the appearance of an unstable emulsion during the time im- 
mediately following cessation of agitation, which is applicable to the great 



276 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



majority of cases. As soon as agitation is stopped, the mixture separates 
by sedimentation and coalescence into two liquid layers (primary break), 
fairly rapidly unless the viscosity of the continuous phase is large. During 
this period, three distinct zones are discernible: a layer of light liquid at the 
top of the container, a layer of heavy liquid at the bottom, and a central 
portion containing the remaining unsettled emulsion. This period is con- 
sidered complete when the upper and lower liquid layers have grown to 
meet at a sharply defined interface, at the expense of the central portion. 
Both liquid layers may then be clear, but ordinarily one of them, and some- 
times both, are cloudy owing to a foglike dispersion of a relatively small 
quantity of the other phase. The cloud eventually settles out, leaving 
both layers clear (secondary break), although this process is ordinarily 
very slow. The phase which is present in the largest volume after primary 
break is usually clouded and the other clear, both conditions accentuated 
by increased volume ratio of the two phases. When the volume ratio ex- 
ceeds approximately 3, corresponding to the 74 per cent packing density of 
spheres as discussed above, the layer in the minority is ordinarily entirely

Settlers. Primary break of the emulsion is ordinarily so rapid that 
merely providing a short period without agitation is usually sufficient to 
permit phase separation. In batch processes the mixture may be settled 
in the agitation vessel or in any other convenient tank. In continuous 
processes the mixture is usually allowed to flow through a vessel of large 
cross section where turbulence is at a minimum and holding time for 
settling is provided. The simple gravity settler, as it is called, is an empty 
tank such as that in Fig. 9.15. The level of the interface within the 
settler and the level of the heavy liquid in the siphon break adjust them- 
selves so that

For satisfactory operation without liquid-level control, the Ap terms must 
be kept either very small or substantially equal, whence the relative height 
c for any desired interface position can be computed by 

ap h = bpi + cp h (9.25) 

More positive control over the position of the interface to ensure satisfac- 
tory phase separations requires that a control valve operated by a liquid- 
level controller, in turn actuated by the position of the interface, be in- 
stalled on the heavy-liquid exit pipe, with elimination of the siphon break. 
Devices of the sort described have been the subject of many patents [see, 
for example (19)].

Many variations of the simple gravity settler are in use. For example, 
vertical rather than horizontal settling seems to be more satisfactory in 
some cases (14), although the horizontal arrangement is usually preferred 
and would seem more logical. Advantages have been claimed for placing 
them at an angle, as in Fig. 9.16 (18, 57). Admission of the mixture to be 
settled at the level of the interface is favored; tangential entrance into a 
vertical tank, deliberately to produce a gentle swirl which presumably 
assists the settling has been suggested (37, 50). The device of Edeleanu, 
et al., Fig. 9.16, reduces the velocity of the dispersion, and hence the tur- 
bulence, as it enters the settler. Baffles of various descriptions are fre- 
quently introduced to influence the direction of flow so as to cause impinge- 
ment of the dispersion on the baffles. Baffles are also profitably used to

ensure laminar flow and to reduce the distance through which the dispersed 
phase must settle, thus reducing the settling time, as in the case of the 
settler of Burtis and Kirkbride (15), Fig. 9.17. The number of patents 
concerned with devices of this sort is very large.

tray. The settled layers either pass through the openings in the tray or 
around the end. The heavy layer then flows back through the space under- 
neath the tray, the light layer through the space above. Any additional

The Stratford Engineering Corporation's " Decelerating Settler," suc- 
cessfully used in handling two-phase mixtures resulting from acid treatment 
of petroleum products and for caustic neutralization of acid oils, is shown 
in Fig. 9.19. This settler is unique in that the flow of emulsion is gradually 
decelerated by flow through a constantly expanding cross section, ultimately 
reaching a value of a fraction of an inch per second. Incoming mixture,

distributed throughout the length of the vessel, enters through a slot in the 
inlet pipe under the hood, thus eliminating disturbances which would un- 
duly agitate the settling emulsion. 

The holding time to be used in the design of such settlers cannot be 
generally specified, since the time for primary break is so dependent upon 
the properties of the mixture to be settled, size of drops, and the nature of 
the previous agitation, as discussed above. Most settlers in the petroleum 
industry are designed for holding times of 30 min. to 1 hr., although with 
baffling to ensure laminar flow and small settling distances for the dis-

persed drops these times could frequently be shortened. Since the time of 
settling of a fog remaining after the primary break is usually considerable, 
it will rarely be practical to attempt the secondary break in such a settler 
without previous treatment of the emulsion, especially if additional extrac- 
tion stages follow. Carry-over of a fog to a subsequent stage ordinarily 
results in only a small reduction in stage efficiency. 

Where settling is slow due to small density difference, high viscosity of 
the continuous phase, or small particle size, centrifuges can be used to in- 
crease the rate. They are expensive machines, however, and can rarely 
be justified except in cases where the value of the product is high and low 
hold-up in settling devices is required, as in the case of penicillin extraction. 
Complete separation still requires coalescence, which is not affected by 
centrifugal force, and a stable emulsion will be merely concentrated and 
not broken by centrifuging (5). 

Inducing Coalescence. Addition of excess of the phase which is dis- 
persed will often bring about rapid coalescence, frequently if dilution is 
carried out at least to the extent of the 3:1 ratio mentioned previously. 
Bikerman (7) explains that in the case of water-in-oil petroleum emulsions 
the frequent success of such procedures is due to the presence of oil-soluble 
emulsifiers which normally tend to keep the oil as the continuous phase. 
Dilution beyond the 3:1 ratio, on the other hand, tends to bring about in- 
version to oil-in- water emulsions, so that as a net result no emulsion is stable. 

The observations of Meissner and Chertow (43) with this technique are 
most informative. They showed tjhat the secondary fog which may be 
present in the majority phase after primary break may frequently be 
coalesced and settled by addition of roughly four times its volume of the 
dispersed phase (the majority phase after the second settling is then likely 
to be clouded). After studying a large number of two- and three-compo- 
nent systems, it was shown that, with the exception of glycerol-nitrobenzene 
mixtures, coalescence of the secondary fog resulted when the dispersed 
phase was polar and did not occur if it was nonpolar. Thus, benzene 
clouded with a secondary fog of water droplets could be successfully 
treated by agitation with excess water, whereas water clouded by a benzene 
fog could not be clarified by addition of benzene. Distribution of hydro- 
chloric acid between the phases, thus introducing a polar substance into 
both, made both fogs recoverable. Similarly, secondary fogs in either phase 
of nitrobenzene-water mixtures responded. For systems containing a polar 
dispersed phase, they suggest operation :uv&gt;&gt;i-i:i!|r to the flowsheet of 
Fig. 9.20: the dispersion of A and B is settled in settler no. 1, where primary 
break occurs; the clear B layer is withdrawn, the clouded A layer is agitated 
with excess B layer; final settling in settler no. 2 then provides clear A and 
clouded B which is recycled. Other variations of this technique can be 
devised, but they all require extensive recycling. 



EQUIPMENT FOR STAGEWISE CONTACT 281 

Causing the emulsion to flow through a porous substance which has a 
large ratio of surface to volume but contains relatively large capillary open- 
ings, which is preferentially wetted by the dispersed phase, will frequently 
induce coalescence, possibly owing to mechanical destruction of the sur- 
face film surrounding the dispersed phase droplets. Thus, allowing water- 
in-petroleum emulsions to flow through a bed of excelsior is used extensively 
as a coalescing process. Beds of steel wool are successful in causing coa- 
lescence of the fog of aqueous alkaline solutions dispersed in gasoline (12).

Beds of glass fibers (34) or layers of pumice stone (21) are useful. The most 
complete data on a coalescent device of this sort is provided by Burtis and 
Kirkbride (15) who report on tests of a Fiberglas bed for coalescing dis- 
persions of salt water in crude petroleum. Their pertinent results can be 
briefly summarized, to indicate at least the nature of some of the variables 
which govern such processes: (a) efficiency of coalescence decreased with 
increasing velocity of flow; 0.25 to 1.0 ft./min. superficial velocity is effec- 
tive, depending upon the properties of the emulsion, particularly water-oil 
ratio and temperature; (6) coalescence improved at elevated temperatures, 
probably because of reduced viscosity of the oil phase; (c) desalting of the 
oil improved as water-oil ratio increased, but it is not clear that this effect 
is entirely due to coalescence; (rf) certain secondary emulsions failed to 
coalesce; (e) a depth of 3 to 4 in. of Fiberglas at a packing density of 13 lb./ 
cu. ft. is ordinarily sufficient. These results were confirmed with a large- 
scale installation of the same process (25). Beds of coarse wire mesh, and 
even tower packings such as Raschig rings, have been successfully used as 
coalescers. These devices may be used immediately following the mixer 
or agitator, thus decreasing the holding time necessary in the settler which 
follows.

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



If the capillary size of a porous substance is very small, then although the 
liquid which preferentially wets the solid may flow through the capillaries 
readily, the strong interfacial films which separate the wetting from the 
nonwetting liquid may block the capillaries for flow of the nonwetting liquid. 
Sufficient pressure will cause the disruption of the film, permitting the non- 
wetting liquid to pass through the porous solid, but regulation of the pres- 
sure commensurate with the pore size and 
t lau'd / interfacial tension can permit separation of 

- c=l the phases. For example, the force resisting 

the distention of the interfacial film at the 
entrance to a circular capillary of diameter do 
is the product of the circumference of the 
capillary by the interfacial tension a. The 
force tending to cause disruption is the prod- 
uct of the cross-sectional area of the capil- 
lary by the pressure p. At equilibrium, 




(9.26) 
* 

Thus, if a benzene-water dispersion, a = 35 
dynes/cm., is brought into contact with a 
porous porcelain which is preferentially 
wetted by water (hydrophilic) and which has 
been previously wetted, of maximum pore 
diameter of 2.0 microns (0.0002 cm.), Eq. 
(9.26) indicates an equilibrium pressure of 
700,000 dynes/sq. cm., or 10.2 Ib./sq. in. 
Thus, if the pressure is kept at a value less 
than 10.2 Ib./sq. in., water will flow through 
the capillaries but the benzene will not, thus 
effecting the separation. Similarly a hy- 
drophobic porous substance could be operated to permit the flow of ben- 
zene but not that of water. Figure 9.21 is a representation of a device 
which is successful in separating unstable emulsions by use of these 
principles. The emulsion is first passed through a porous solid for coalesc- 
ing the dispersed phase, whereupon considerable settling occurs. The 
heavy liquid then passes through a porous solid of small pore diameter, 
treated in such a fashion as to be preferentially wetted by the continuous 
phase. Droplets of dispersed light phase do not pass through but collect 
and coalesce until large enough to rise to the upper part of the apparatus. 
The light liquid is handled in similar fashion. The theoretical principles 
upon which such a device operates have been outlined in some detail (55). 
Stable Emulsions. The presence of some emulsifying agent is usually

responsible for stability of emulsions, and with a few exceptions this must be 
destroyed, counteracted, or removed for successful breaking. Berkman 
and Egloff (6) review in detail the general methods of dealing with stable 
emulsions, but they present such problems that liquid-extraction operations 
involving them cannot ordinarily be considered in industrial work. 

MULTIPLE-STAGE PLANTS 

A multiple-stage plant will consist of several stages ,::T .!';: ! for cocurrent 
or countercurrent operation, each stage consisting of a combination of at 
least a mixer and a settler of the types described above. Additional equip- 
ment, such as coalescers or centrifuges, may or may not be included, depend- 
ing upon the difficulty of phase separation. Figure 9.22 shows a typical

arrangement, and it can be appreciated that other types of mixers and 
settlers could be substituted and that different arrangements are possible. 
For example, if floor space is at a premium, the settlers can be built one over 
the other in the form of a tower, with the mixers and pumps on the ground 
level (22). In others, provided that density differences are sufficiently 
great, mixers and settlers can be arranged for gravity flow, thus eliminating 
transfer pumps between stages. The latter method is used in the Holley- 
Mott plant (2, 28), shown in Fig. 9.23, a design which has been very suc- 
cessful in the treatment of naphthas (1, 59) and in dephenolization of gas- 
works ammoniacal liquor (51). The interconnections between mixers and 
settlers for each stage provide for recirculation within the stage, so that 
relative proportions of the two phases in the mixer are independent of the 
relative net flows. Flow between stages is entirely due to difference in 
density of the liquids. The agitators of the mixers are simple, but for the 
liquids which have been contacted in such plants they are apparently 
entirely adequate. Morello and Poffenberger (48) described a plant of 
somewhat similar design. There has recently been made available a 
centrifugal extractor which is said to accomplish a single-stage extraction

Stage Efficiencies. No extensive studies of the stage efficiencies, or 
ratio of ideal to real stages, have been made available. Table 9.1 lists 
typical data on commercial-sized plants, and it appears that stage effi- 
ciencies of 75 to 100 per cent are readily obtained. It seems quite probable 
that to a large extent efficiencies below 100 per cent are due to incomplete

settling rather than inadequate mixing in most industrial plants. Despite 
the more clumsy appearance, the discrete-stage type of plant is frequently 
favored over the continuous contact devices to be described in the next 
chapter, since with our present knowledge there is less uncertainty in ob- 
taining the required number of stages. 

Laboratory Equipment. Useful laboratory equipment for stagewise ex- 
traction is described by Knox et al. (35), which utilizes packed mixing 
columns or agitators with settlers much in the manner of large-scale equip- 
ment, and whose stage efficiency is apparently 100 per cent (4). For cases 
where large numbers of stages are required, the device of Martin and 
Synge (42) is convenient.

CHAPTER 10 
EQUIPMENT FOR CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT CONTACT 

Equipment wherein the insoluble liquids flow countercurrently in continu- 
ous contact can be built to contain the equivalent of as many stages as 
desired. In every case, the countercurrent flow is brought about by the 
difference in densities of the two liquids, and the equipment usually takes 
the appearance of a vertical tower with or without internal devices to in- 
fluence the flow pattern. The length of path of travel for the liquids is 
dependent upon the number of stages required, while the cross-sectional 
area for flow depends upon the quantities of the liquids to be handled. 
The number of designs which have been proposed is very large, as evidenced 
by the considerable patent literature. Only a relatively few major types 
have had successful industrial application, however. These may to a cer- 
tain extent be classified according to the method of contacting the liquids, 
as follows: 

1. Film contact, neither liquid dispersed. One liquid is spread over a 
surface in the form of a film while in contact with the other liquid. 

2. Dispersed contact, where one or both liquids are mechanically dis- 
persed to provide increased area for extraction. Dispersion may be 
brought about by causing one of the liquids to flow through nozzles, orifices, 
screens, packing, etc., or by agitation. The liquids may be dispersed once 
or many times after intermediate coalescence. 

Such a classification is far from perfect, since in many of the second type 
film-flow occurs at least in part of the equipment. On the other hand, the 
second type includes practically all the commercially important equipment 
and will be considered first. 

EQUIPMENT TYPES 

Spray Towers. Spray towers are the simplest of the equipment involv- 
ing dispersion of one of the liquids, and as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 
10.1, they are merely empty shells with provisions for introducing and re- 
moving the liquids. Consider operation according to Fig. 10. la, where 
the light liquid is dispersed. Heavy liquid entering at the top through 
the distributor fills the tower almost completely, flows downward as a 
continuous phase, and leaves at the bottom. As shown in the figure, it 
leaves through a loop b so as to ensure the tower being filled with liquid. 
Light liquid enters at the bottom through a distributor which disperses it

into small drops. These rise through the continuous heavy liquid by virtue 
of their smaller density and collect in a layer d at the top, which then 
flows out of the tower. The head of heavy liquid at the bottom of the loop 
b (static pressure + pressure drop due to friction) must balance the head 
of combined light and heavy liquids in the tower, and the position of the 
interface e will adjust itself accordingly.

It is clear that if the loop carrying the heavy liquid out of the tower is 
lowered, as in Fig. 10.16, the interface e must move downward, and by 
adjustment of the loop height it can be made to locate itself at the bottom 
of the tower as shown. The tower then operates with the heavy liquid 
dispersed into drops. Alternatively, the interface can be regulated so as 
to remain near the center of the tower, as in Fig. 10. Ic. The loop arrange- 
ment for regulating the position of the interface is used frequently in labora- 
tory and pilot-plant towers, but in industrial practice it is much more 
satisfactory to regulate the pressure drop through the heavy liquid exit 
pipe by a valve at /, preferably automatically operated by a liquid-level 
controller actuated by movement of the interface, thus dispensing with the 
necessity of the loop. The figures show the arrangement for operating 
with stripping or enriching sections only; if central feed is used, a distributor 
much like those at the top and bottom of the tower is used to introduce the 
feed liquid at the desired position in the tower. 



292 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

Consider again the operation shown in Fig. 10. la, with the rate of flow 
of heavy liquid fixed while that of light liquid is slowly increased. At low 
rates for the light liquid, the drops of dispersed phase form regularly at the 
distributor and rise without interference to collect in the layer at the top. 
As the rate is increased, drops are formed more frequently and they tend 
to crowd each other as they rise; the hold-up of dispersed phase increases. 
Since the pressure drop through the light-liquid exit pipe at the top of the 
tower increases with increased flow, there will be a tendency for the inter- 
face e to lower, which can be overcome by raising the loop b or by closing 
down slightly on a valve at /. The increased hold-up of dispersed phase 
reduces the available area for flow of the continuous phase, which must then 
flow at higher local velocities. As the rate of flow of light liquid is further 
increased, the hold-up of dispersed phase increases, and the increased 
velocity of the continuous phase usually causes very erratic movement of 
the drops. Large eddy currents develop, considerable swirl may occur, and 
with a glass tower it can be observed that there is considerable recirculation 
(rise and fall) of the drops. The distributor causes a restriction in the 
free area for flow of dispersed phase and will ordinarily be the cause of 
difficulty. Crowding of the drops at this point may result in* coalescence 
into large globules of light liquid which may be carried down into the lower 
part of the tower. Hold-up of light liquid is thus increased greatly, and 
large quantities are carried out the exit pipe for the heavy liquid. The 
tower seems to fill with light liquid, which frequently becomes the continu- 
ous phase. The tower is then flooded, and satisfactory operation is no 
longer possible. The same situation will ordinarily arise if the light liquid 
rate is kept constant and heavy liquid rate is increased, although at very 
low rates for the light liquid, it may be observed that before flooding oc- 
curs appreciable numbers of drops of dispersed phase are carried out with 
the heavy liquid owing to its high velocity. For each rate of flow of light 
liquid there is a rate for the heavy liquid beyond which satisfactory opera- 
tion cannot be maintained. 

A great many of the difficulties described above can be avoided if care is 
taken not to restrict the flow area in the tower and to introduce the con- 
tinuous phase with a minimum of disturbance to the flow pattern. The 
column described by Elgin and Bliuuling (9, 24) is exceptionally satisfac- 
tory in this respect and is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 10.2 for opera- 
tion with light liquid dispersed. At the top, the heavy liquid is introduced 
in such a manner as not to result in high local velocities. At the bottom, 
the flared end is constructed preferably with an angle from the vertical not 
greater than 16, which results in a gradually decreasing downward velocity 
of the continuous phase. The annular space between the walls of the ex- 
panded bottom section and the distributor should be sufficiently large to 
reduce the velocity of the continuous phase to from 0.2 to 0.9 its value in 



CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT EQUIPMENT 



293 




the column proper. In this way formation of the drops at the distributor 
is not disturbed. With such arrangements, the flow regime for flooding 
is characterized by high hold-up of dispersed phase in the column, with the 
mass of drops extending down into the funnel-shaped lower 
end. Excessive coalescence does not occur nor is the dispersed 
phase carried out with the heavy liquid, and operation in the 
flooded state is perfectly feasible. Much higher flow rates are 
possible than with straight-sided towers. For operation with 
the heavy phase dispersed, the tower is constructed in upside- 
down fashion as compared with the arrangement of Fig. 10.2. 
Other designs embodying these principles have been suggested 
(15), but none have been so well worked out. 

The freedom with which the continuous phase can recircu- 
late in the spray tower may lead to a lowering of extraction 
efficiency because of the lack of true countercurrent flow. 
This would presumably be aggravated with large tower di- 
ameters, and at least in one case (59) several small-diameter 
towers in parallel were used in preference to one with a large 
diameter in an attempt to overcome this tendency. Pre- 
sumably vertical baffling in a single tower would also be 
helpful. 

The simplicity of construction, low cost, ease of cleaning, 
trouble-free operation, and high flow capacities make the 
spray tower very attractive, although the height required for 
a given number of stages will ordinarily be greater than for 
other types. 

Packed Towers. In order to increase the turbulence of the flow regime 
so as to improve extraction rates, the towers are frequently filled with pack- 
ings of the type commonly used in gas absorption work. Raschig rings, 
which were early applied to these problems (67), and Berl saddles are most 
frequently used, and descriptions of these are given in the standard refer- 
ence works (63). Other packings such as wooden grids (35), lumps of coke 
(38, 47), and spiral wire work (11) have also been successful. Packing of 
the type that is dumped at random may be supported on an open screen 
work, woven of sufficiently heavy wire to support the necessary weight, 
with openings just small enough to retain the packing pieces. Perforated 
plates have been used, but they usually offer such restriction to flow that 
flooding is very likely to occur at the packing support. If the continuous 
liquid rather than the dispersed preferentially wets the packing support, 
it is important that the dispersed-phase distributor be embedded in the 
packing (24), else crowding of the drops of dispersed phase at the support, 
with coalescence and flooding, is likely to occur. If the continuous phase 
wets the packing preferentially, the dispersed phase passes through the 




Spray tower of 
Elgin (24).

tower in droplets. If the dispersed phase wets the packing preferentially, 
it flows along the packing in rivulets or continuous films. As with spray 
towers, the interface between phases may be held at any desired level. 

Although no systematic study has been made respecting the relative size 
of the packing particles to be used as compared to the diameter of the tower, 
it seems reasonable to follow the principles established for gas-absorption 

work, that the ratio of tower diameter to 
particle size should not be less than 8:1. 
This should reduce the tendency toward 
channeling and would seem particularly 
important when attempting to obtain de- 
sign data from experiments with small tow- 
ers, where the packing density in the pilot 
plant ought to be the same as that expected 
in the large tower. It is common practice 
to arrange the packing in the tower in a 
series of beds separated by unpacked 
spaces, as in Fig. 10.3, to provide for redis- 
tribution of the liquids should channeling 
occur. In cases where the dispersed liquid 
flows in a film over the packing, this prac- 
tice also provides for redispersion of the 
liquid and exposure of new surface to con- 
tact with the other phase. Cooling or 
heating coils can conveniently be installed 
in these open spaces should they be required. 
For cases where the dispersed phase does 
not wet the packing support, however, this 
may lead to flooding difficulties as described 
above. Baffles at intervals can also be used to circumvent channeling 
tendencies (10), or one of the liquids may be withdrawn entirely by a 
collecting device and be redistributed (22). 

The approach to flooding in packed towers is usually characterized by 
increased hold-up of dispersed phase within the packing, with increased 
coalescence giving the dispersed phase a tendency to become continuous. 
At flooding, a layer of dispersed phase appears at the inlet to the packing, 
and further increase in the flow rate causes dispersed phase to flow out the 
exit pipe for the continuous liquid. Should the packing support offer 
excessive restriction to flow, however, flooding may occur owing to dis- 
turbances at this point at rates of flow considerably below the maximum 
that can be put through, the packing alone. As might be expected, the 
maximum flow rates for packed towers are considerably less than for spray 
towers because of the decreased area for flow and the increased tendency

toward coalescence. Higher rates than otherwise can be obtained with the 
end designs of Elgin (24) . 

After the spray towers, packed towers are undoubtedly the simplest to 
construct and are probably the least costly for handling highly corrosive 
liquids. Where the liquids contain suspended solids, or where solids may 
be precipitated during the course of extraction, however, the tendency of 
the packing to clog and the difficulty of cleaning make them less desirable. 
Packed towers have had extensive application in the solvent refining of 
lubricating oils, removal of hydrogen sulfide from petroleum fractions, 
sweetening of naphthas, removal of phenols from gasworks ammoniacal 
liquors, solvent refining of vegetable oils, and in general chemical recovery 
in the synthetic organic chemicals industries.

Baffle Towers. These extractors consist of vertical towers containing 
horizontal baffles to direct the flow of the liquids. There are three principal 
types: disk-and-doughnut, side-to-side, and center-to-side. 

Disk-and-doughnut baffles consist of alternate annular rings (doughnuts) 
attached to the shell of the tower and centrally located circular disks sup- 
ported by spacer rods or by arms extending to the shell (23). In some 
designs, Fig. 10.4a, the disks have the same diameter as that of the opening 
in the doughnut, as suggested by Thompson (80). In Ittner's arrange- 



296 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



ment (44), Fig. 10.46, the central opening of the doughnut is relatively 
small and the disks are provided with lips to form a pool of heavy liquid on 
the disk. These devices have been in use for years despite the relatively 
recent dates of the patents. In this type of column, the dispersed liquid 
flows along the baffle in a thin film and then falls over the edge of the baffle 
in a broken sheet through the continuous liquid. If interfacial tension and

density difference are low, the tendency for the dispersed liquid to remain 
in film and sheet form will be considerably lessened, and instead the be- 
havior is more like that of a spray tower with the baffles providing additional 
turbulence. Coahran's tower (17) provides for radial veins on the upper 
and lower surface of both disks and doughnuts and slow rotation of the 
disks which are supported on a central shaft. The agitation thus provided 
adds to the effectiveness of contact. Still another type, in use for some 
time for extraction of acetic acid from pyroligneous liquor (59), provides 
rotating arms attached to the central rotating shaft which scrape accumu-

lated solids from the doughnut baffles and stationary arms attached to the 
shell which scrape the rotating disks. 

Side-to-side flow is provided by the segmental baffle arrangement of 
Fig. 10.5a. In the design shown, the baffles are made with a collar to pro- 
vide a friction fit in the shell, are kept in place by spacer posts, and are fitted 
with an edge lip which not only stiffens the baffle but also provides a means 
of collecting a pool of dispersed liquid on 
the baffle (33). The center-to-center type, 
Fig. 10.56, is the same in principle but is 
used in the larger diameter towers to reduce 
the length of travel of the liquid film on the 
baffle. Baffle spacing in these towers is 
ordinarily 4 to 6 in. The towers are ver- 
satile, capable of handling a wide variety of 
liquids and flow rates, and have had applica- 
tion in the extraction of acetic acid from 
pyroligneous liquors and from solutions used 
in cellulose acetate rayon manufacture, in 
the extraction of caffeine in the food indus- 
tries, and for general chemical recovery in 
the synthetic organic chemicals industries. 

Perforated-plate Towers. In the perfo- 
rated-plate, or sieve-plate, column, the dis- 
persed phase is repeatedly coalesced and 
redispersed by causing it to flow through a 
series of trays in which a large number of 
small holes have been punched or drilled. In 
the simplest type, the plates are similar to 
the side-to-side baffles described above, ex- 
cept that they are perforate. Hunter and 
Nash (42) describe a successful installation 
of this type for dephenolating gas liquor consisting of a 46-ft.-high shell, 
5 ft. in diameter, in which the baffles each contain two hundred Ke-in. holes. 

Usually some more positive means of conducting the continuous liquid 
from tray to tray is provided. In Fig. 10.6, a tower of the type described 
by Harrington (34), for example, the continuous phase flows across the 
plates and from plate to plate by means of the pipes provided for that 
purpose. These pipes extend sufficiently far to be sealed in the layer of 
continuous liquid on the plate. The dispersed phase collects on the trays 
in a coalesced layer and bubbles through the perforations of the plate. As 
shown, the light liquid is dispersed in the lower part of the tower and the 
heavy in the upper part, although only one of the liquids, preferably that 
which does not wet the plate, needs be dispersed. When the flow of con-

tinuous liquid is large, in order to reduce the pressure drop through the 
downcomers or risers, larger cross section for flow can be provided by 
segmental flow areas (79) as in Fig. 10.7; for still larger diameters, alternate 
center and side downcomers can be provided. While it is customary to 
install the pipes or ducts for the continuous phase 
with a short lip extending beyond the tray from which 
it leads the liquid, higher flow capacities can be 
obtained if the pipes are kept flush with the plates 
(66). These ducts have on occasion been filled with 
tower packing such as Raschig rings for coalescing 
any dispersed phase which may be entrained by the 
continuous phase. 

Perforation sizes vary from J-f g to % m - m diam- 
eter in practice, and tray spacings from 6 in. to 2 ft. 
or more. It is observed that at certain flow rates the 
dispersed phase issues from the perforations in jets, 
which may reach considerable length before dispers- 
ing into droplets. For efficient extraction, the plate 
spacing should be sufficiently great that these jets 
are dispersed before they reach the coalesced layer 
on the next plate. Flooding in the equipment can 
occur either due to inability to maintain the position 
of the principal interface between the light and 
heavy liquids at the end of the tower (or at the cen- 
ter if so operated), or else due to thickening of the 
coalesced layer on a plate until it reaches the adja- 
cent plate. 

Towers of the type described have been exten- 
sively used, particularly in petroleum refining where 
they have been built to diameters of 12 ft. Modifi- 
cations have been suggested, such as that of Laird 
(52) which provides for tilting the perforated trays 
and of van Dijck (83) which involves rapid vibration 
of the plates. A design which substitutes a fine, 
wire-mesh screen for the perforated tray (54) has 
been used in the refining of wood rosin, with a 3-ft.- 
diameter tower and an 8-in. tray spacing (41). 

Designs which utilize a vertically arranged per- 
forated plate have been particularly popular in petroleum-refining work. 
An early device (56) caused light liquid to collect underneath the plates 
in a tower and bubble through perforations in a downcomer whio.h led the 
heavy liquid from plate to plate. A more modern design, Fig. 10.8, is an 
arrangement successfully used for large-diameter towers. The heavy phase

is dispersed in the upper section of the tower by trays constructed with 
vertical perforated plates flanked by boxes containing Raschig rings to 
coalesce entrained light liquid (4). The light liquid is dispersed by trays 
with horizontal perforated plates in the lower section of the tower. 

The Koch tower (50), Fig. 10.9, 
is an unusual arrangement involving 
perforations in a vertical plate. This 
device was originally used for vapor- 
liquid contact, but several installa- 
tions for contacting gasoline with 
caustic sweetening solutions have 
been made. In a typical tray, heavy 
liquid flows down the downcomer 
at a and through the opening at b. 
Light liquid flowing upward enters 
the openings c, and through the 
spaces at d y thus sweeping the heavy 
liquid upward along the vertical per- 
forated plates e. The heavy liquid 
flows through the perforations, falls, 
and is swept upward again through 
the next perforated plate, thus ex- 
periencing several dispersions. Final 
disengagement and coalescence take 
place in the downcomer at /. 

Other Dispersion Contactors. The 
success of the bubble-cap column in 
liquid-vapor contacting naturally led 
to attempts at application in liquid- 
liquid contacting, and its use for 
this purpose has been patented (14). 
No record of commercial installations 
is recorded. Some early experiments 
in contacting lubricating oil with 
dichloroethyl ether by Rogers and Thiele (68) with bubble caps of more or 
less conventional design showed such low capacity and tray efficiency ( &lt; 33 
per cent), and similarly in contacting water-benzoic acid solutions with 
benzene by Sherwood (75) (efficiency &lt; 5 per cent) that extensive work 
with these devices has been to some extent discouraged. It is quite pos- 
sible that if designs were modified to take into consideration the lower 
density differences and interfacial tensions, and higher viscosities encoun- 
tered in liquid-liquid contact a successful arrangement could be devised. 
A simple but apparently very effective design is described by Allen, et aL

were spaced at 1 in. A somewhat similar design, but without the risers and 
downcomers, was suggested by Ittner (44).

Although Jantzen (45) early described some highly successful extractions 
in small-scale equipment fitted with internal agitation for redispersion of 
the liquids, it is only recently that a successful device in commercial sizes 
has been produced by Scheibel (72, 73), Fig. 10.11. The agitators are 
simple four-bladed flat turbines, which operate at speeds up to 600 r.p.m. 
depending on the materials being extracted. The emulsions produced in 
the agitator zones are coalesced by the fine wire mesh. Successful opera- 
tion is apparently sensitive to the design of the mesh, and a specially pre- 
pared mesh is used containing 97 to 98 per cent voids. The packed sections 
may be varied in thickness from 1 in. in laboratory-sized columns to 1 ft. 
or more in commercial-sized columns. Successful pilot-plant towers of 12 
and 14 in. in diameter have been operated. 

A laboratory column utilizing alternate agitated sections and settling 
zones is described by Cornish et al. (21). Simpler laboratory devices which 
also give high extraction efficiencies consist merely of a vertical tube con- 
taining a rotating axial rod (62, 74). 

Wetted-wall Equipment. Wetted-wall equipment resembling that used 
in gas-absorption studies has been used for laboratory investigations only

in studies where an attempt has been made to control and measure the 
interfacial area between the immiscible liquids. These devices provide for 
the heavy liquid to flow down the inside wall of a circular pipe an inch or two 
in diameter, while the light liquid flows upward as a central core. It is 
unlikely that devices of this sort will find commercial application, since 
stable operation is difficult to maintain. Difficulty is encountered with 
preferential wetting of the wall by the core liquid, tendency of the core liquid 
to sweep the wall fluid away from the wall, and of the wall fluid to break away 
and shower down through the core fluid in droplets. Only a limited range 
of flow rates for either phase is possible.

A variant of the wetted-wall column was designed by Gordon and 
Zeigler (32) where the heavy liquid flows down an inclined flat plate while 
the light liquid flows upward in countercurrent. The passages for liquid 
flow are rectangular in cross section, % in. wide, and arranged in parallel. 
At least one successful installation has been recorded (59). 

The Podbielniak centrifugal contactor (64), Fig. 10.12, is a modification 
which has been singularly successful, however. This device consists 
principally of a passage, rectangular in cross section and wound in a spiral 
of 33 turns, through which the liquid flows. The spiral rotor is revolved at 
speeds between 2,000 and 5,000 r.p.m., depending upon the service condi- 
tions. Light liquid is pumped into the machine through the shaft on which 
the rotor revolves and is led to the periphery of the spiral; heavy liquid 



CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT EQUIPMENT 303 

is similarly pumped to the center of the spiral. Owing to the considerable 
centrifugal force developed by the rotation, the heavy liquid flows counter- 
currently to the light liquid to the periphery of the spiral from where it is 
led back to the shaft and out of the machine. In the same fashion the 
light liquid flows to the center and is likewise removed from the shaft. 
The machines are made in various sizes capable of handling 500 cu. cm./min. 
in the laboratory size up to 2,400 gal./hr. of combined liquids for industrial 
work. At least in some designs, the spiral has been perforate. They are 
expensive in first cost and to operate but offer the following advantages: a 
wide range of feed-to-solvent ratios are feasible; low floor-space and head- 
room requirements; extremely low hold-up (9 gal. in a 2,400-gal./hr. 
machine) ; they are almost portable and can be connected in series and in 
parallel in a variety of ways; they can handle mixtures which tend to emul- 
sify readily. For these reasons they have been widely used for the extrac- 
tion steps in the manufacture of antibiotic substances such as penicillin, 
streptomycin, chloromycetin, and bacitracin. Pharmaceutical products 
such as these can absorb the relatively high costs, and the ease with which 
the extraction plants can be dismantled and reassembled when process flow- 
sheets are changed make these devices useful in this field. 

FLOW CAPACITIES 

Spray Towers. Blanding and Elgin (9) have demonstrated conclusively 
that consistent flooding data can very likely only be obtained with end 
designs of the type shown in Fig. 10.2. Typical of the data obtained with 
such towers are those shown in Fig. 10.13, plotted on coordinates suggested 
by Colburn (18). Study of curves 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this figure, which deal 
with two systems of similar physical properties, indicates the importance 
of the diameters of the nozzles used to distribute the dispersed phase, which 
regulate the drop size. The considerable effect of changing the dispersed 
phase in the xylene-water system is shown by curves 4 and 5, but in the 
ketone- water system there is substantially no effect (curve 6). Additional 
data for the xylene and ketone systems are given by Blanding and 
Elgin. 

The curves for any one system can almost be brought together by dividing 
the ordinate of Fig. 10.13 by the square root of the prevailing drop diame- 
ters, but the correlation is by no means good. The most promising general 
approach is that of Elgin and Foust (26), who found that flooding in spray 
towers when finely divided solid particles represented the dispersed phase 
paralleled the phenomena observed by Blanding and Elgin. Flooding in 
both cases occurs when the velocity of the individual particles relative to 
that of the continuous fluid (Up + Uc) is 75 per cent of the free-fall velocity 
of the particles in the stationary continuous liquid, assuming the particles 



304

to be spherical. The velocity of the particles is related to the superficial 
velocity of the dispersed phase through the dispersed phase hold-up: 



u 



(10.1) 



where H is the fractional volumetric hold-up of dispersed phase and UD and 
Uc the superficial velocities of dispersed and continuous phases. In the 
absence of specific data, Elgin and Foust recommend the correlation of 
Wilhelm and Kwauk (85) for fluidized beds of solids for estimation of the

Packed Towers. There are available the results of only three investiga- 
tions exclusively devoted to the study of the flow phenomena in packed 
towers. In each case, small towers fitted with the special end designs of 
Elgin (Fig. 10.2) were used, with packings of J^-in. and ^-in. size. Unfor- 
tunately, no studies are reported for the larger packing sizes which are 
usually used in industrial towers, and in the case of the J/2-in. packings, the 
packing density is probably somewhat smaller than would be found in 
large-diameter towers. With minor exceptions the descriptions of the flood- 
ing phenomena observed in two of the investigations agree, and the data of 
these studies can be reconciled. 

The studies of Blanding and Elgin (9) were made with J^-in. ceramic 
saddles, carbon Raschig rings, and clay spheres in a 2.39-in.-diameter tower, 
using the systems xylene- and methyl isobutyl ketone-water. Flooding 
velocities were independent of the hole size for the dispersed-phase distribu- 
tor; the drop size seemed to be regulated by the packing, with a tendency 
toward coalescence as flooding conditions were approached. It was ob- 
served that a plot of the square roots of the linear superficial liquid velocities 
(based on the empty tower cross section) at flooding against each other gave 
a straight line for each system. It was later shown (12) that at flooding 
the simple relationship 

U$ + L T # = const. (10.3) 

holds remarkably well, with a different constant for each system. Thus, 
with one accurately determined set of flooding velocities, the entire flooding 
regime for a given system can be approximated. 

Breckenfeld and Wilke (12) used a 2.6-in.-diameter tower packed with 
J^-in. carbon Raschig rings and J^-in. saddles, and a wide variety of liquids. 
They established that higher rates of flow at flooding resulted from greater 
density difference, lower interfacial tension, and lower continuous-phase 
viscosity. Absolute values of the densities and of the viscosity of the dis- 
persed phase seemed to have no effect over the range of these properties 
considered. The data were correlated empirically with those of Blanding 
and Elgin by a modification of a method suggested by Colburn (18), with 
the introduction of the packing characteristics of surface area (a) and frac- 
tional void volume (F) to permit inclusion of the several shapes and sizes 
of packing. 

All the data of the above studies and a few from that of Ballard and 
Piret (5) are presented in Fig. 10.14 plotted according to the method of 
Breckenfeld and Wilke, with the exception that the dispersed-phase velocity 
is used in the ordinate rather than that of the continuous phase, as originally 
suggested by Colburn (18). It is believed that this represents an improve- 
ment in that not only are all the Blanding and Elgin data brought to a 
narrower band, but also the range of the ordinate is larger, thus leading to 



306 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



a curve which is less flat. This correlation must be regarded as tentative 
and should be used with caution, especially if it is attempted to apply it to 
larger packing sizes, since the term a-*/F 2 was established on the basis of 
J^-in. and J^-in. packings only. Further, liquids of high viscosity and 
very low interfacial tension have not been studied. It should also be kept

in mind that flooding may occur at lower velocities in towers not fitted with 
the end designs described earlier, or with distributors and packing supports 
which occupy large portions of the tower cross section. 

Ballard and Piret (5), using columns of 2.03 and 3.75 in. in diameter 
packed with %-iu. and J^-in. porcelain rings, observed that the }^-in. 
rings were preferentially wet by the water. If the water was the dispersed 
phase, the flooding characteristics were similar to those described by 
the previous investigators. These data are included in Fig. 10.14. On the 
other hand, if the water was the continuous phase, important changes in the 
flow regime were noticed at flow rates less than those at flooding, and major 
attention was given to these. For this case, as the flow rate of dispersed 
phase was increased, dispersed phase hold-up and the pressure drop for 
flow increased regularly. At a particular flow rate, a sudden increase in 
pressure drop was noticed which was followed by considerable coalescence 
and increased drop size of dispersed liquid. Three separate behaviors were 
then noticed at higher flow rates, depending upon the interfacial tension, 
which were not always reproducible. The rate of flow at which the initial

marked enlargement of drop size occurred was defined as a " transition" 
condition, and the transition data are plotted in Fig. 10.15 according to the 
coordinates of Fig. 10.14 together with the flooding curve for comparison. 
Ballard and Piret present a more satisfactory correlation which can be 
related to gas-liquid flooding but which cannot be conveniently compared

with the other liquid-liquid data. With J^-in. rings, sharply defined flooding 
was observed, but the data do not correlate with the others for reasons which 
are not now clear. They are shown separately on simplified coordinates 
in Fig. 10.16. 

The lower limits of excessive coalescence, or transition, for the %-in. 
packing have been indicated on Fig. 10.14 as a broken curve. It would 
appear that design conditions should be chosen below this curve at least, so 
as to avoid the coalescence which not only reduces interfacial area between 
the phases but may lead to incipient flooding conditions. 

Miscellaneous capacity data for saddle and ring packings, taken largely 
in small towers during the course of other work, are shown in Fig. 10.17 
on simplified coordinates. Lack of complete data on liquid properties 
precludes attempts to include these on the more general correlation. 
Since in most instances designers do not have such data as interfacial ten- 
sion at hand, this plot may be useful in estimating flow capacities for similar 
liquids. Hold-up data for the dispersed phase in packed columns have been 
reported for a few cases (2, 3, 70). In general, hold-up increases with in- 
creased flow of both phases and is dependent upon whether the dispersed 



308

or continuous phase preferentially wets the packing. The data are too 
few to permit generalizations. 

Illustration 1. Acetic acid is to be extracted from water by isopropyl ether in a 
tower packed with J-in. carbon Raschig rings, ether dispersed. Flow rates are to be 30 
cu. ft./hr. ether, 45 cu. ft./hr. water. Average physical properties are: aqueous phase 
density pc = 63.0 Ib./cu. ft., viscosity MC =3.1 centipoises; ether phase density 
PD = 45.6 Ib./cu. ft.; interfacial tension &lt;/ = 13 dynes/cm. (25). Calculate the diam-

because of inability to maintain an interface at the end of the tower or 
because of thickening of the layers of dispersed phase on the plates. Tend-

ency toward the former can be controlled by elimination of restrictions to 
flow. For control of the latter, the plates must be properly designed. 
Since the flow of the liquids through the tower is entirely due to their 
difference in densities, the driving force required to overcome the various 
resistances is developed by displacement of the continuous phase by the 
dispersed phase, resulting in a layer of dispersed phase on each plate. 
The displacement required for flow of dispersed phase through the perfora- 
tions can be estimated from the ordinary equation for flow through an 
orifice (55, 66) :

all in consistent units. The displacement required to overcome resistance 
to flow of the continuous phase through the downspouts (or risers) can be 
estimated from the contraction and expansion losses on entering and leaving 
the downspouts together with the friction loss for flow through the pipe (55). 
The contraction and expansion losses, for downspout cross sections of 5 per 
cent or less of the column cross section, will equal approximately 1.5 
velocity heads (66): 



where h ce = continuous phase displacement 

PC = continuous phase density 

Ud = velocity through the downspout 

The displacement due to friction in the downspout h/ can be computed 
by standard methods (63). For a case where the dispersed phase prefer- 
entially wets the perforated plate, the total displacement is the sum, 
ho + h ce + hf. On the other hand, if the continuous phase preferentially 
wets the plate, a pressure must be developed merely to start the dispersed 
phase through the perforations against interfacial tension, which can be 
calculated from Eq. (9.26) . Expressing the pressure in terms of continuous- 
phase displacement, this becomes 



For this case the thickness of dispersed phase will be either h ff or the sum 
Ao + h ce + hf, whichever is greater. Additional resistance to flow can pre-

sumably be expected if the thickness of the dispersed layer becomes so 
great that it leaves little room for continuous phase flow across the plate or 
if the clearance between the bottom of the downspout and the plate it 
feeds is too small. These cannot be conveniently estimated.

Figure 10.18 shows a comparison of the hold-up of dispersed phase in a 
small perforated-plate tower (2) with that calculated by the methods 
described. The measured data include the hold-up owing to dispersed 
phase droplets rising through the continuous phase and is consequently 
higher than the calculated hold-up, but the trend of the data is followed very 
well. The observations of several experimenters (2, 60, 70, 81) that the 
thickness of the layer of dispersed phase is apparently independent of dis- 
persed phase flow rate can be shown to be due to the small numerical value 
of ho for these cases. 

The few capacity data available, measured with laboratory columns, are 
shown in Fig. 10.19. Lack of complete data on physical properties of the 
liquids, which contained dissolved solutes, prevents attempts at correlation 
of these, but the great influence of downspout and perforation areas on 
limiting flows is evident. It would appear that downspout cross sections 
of 5 per cent and perforation areas of at least 10 per cent of the tower cross 
section will permit greatly improved flow rates and correspondingly smaller 
tower diameters. 

Spinner Columns. The few flooding data reported for an 11.5-in.- 
diameter column of ScheibePs design (73), Fig. 10.11, obtained in the 
course of another study, cannot be systematized at this time. The limiting 
flow rates seem to be dependent upon the speed of the impeller as well as 
the properties of the liquids and are somewhat lower than the maximum 
reported for comparable systems in conventionally packed towers. Com-

parison with data from a 1-in. column (72) indicates that the coarseness of 
the wire mesh used for the packed sections has a marked influence as well. 

EXTRACTION RATES 

Interpretation of Data. Operating data may be interpreted in terms of 
either mass-transfer coefficients, HTU's or H.E.T.S.'s, depending upon 
which of the methods of Chap. 8 it is planned to use later in design. The 
determination of the values of H.E.T.S. from such data requires no particu- 
lar explanation. In the case of the others, under ordinary circumstances 
the experimental data lead to over-all values of coefficients or transfer units, 
and these should be expressed in terms of the phase where the principal 
resistance to diffusion lies, as explained in Chap. 5. Over-all HTU's and 
Ka's can be converted, one into the other, through Eqs. (8.12) and (8.14). 

In most operations, one phase is dispersed into droplets or otherwise 
broken up while the other is continuous, and either one may be the raffinate 



CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT EQUIPMENT 313 

or the extract. Since the mass-transfer characteristics are more dependent 
upon the conditions of dispersion than the direction of extraction, these will 
be expressed as K c a, K&amp;a, HTUoD, or HTUoc, with the subscripts indicat- 
ing the dispersed or continuous condition irrespective of direction of extrac- 
tion. Thus, if the distribution coefficient m is defined in terms of pound 
moles per cubic foot concentration units, Eq. (8.43) becomes 



(10-7) 



K c a 
or, in terms of KDCI, 

J = J_ . J^L ( 10 8) 

KDCL koCL kca 

In the manner which has been so successful in the systematization of heat- 
transfer measurements, it is desirable to express the experimental data in 
terms of the individual-film transfer coefficients as functions of flow con- 
ditions and fluid properties. 

On the assumption that the degree of turbulence of each phase is affected 
by the rate of flow of both, since the liquids are in direct contact, applica- 
tion of dimensional analysis leads to expressions of the following type: 

(10.9) 
D 

where Re = Reynolds number = 

Sc = Schmidt number = 

D = diffusivity of solute 

d = some linear dimension characteristic of the equipment 
The exponents on the various dimensionless groups are presumably con- 
stants, although the relationship between the groups need not necessarily 
be of the indicated form. Equation (10.7) then becomes 



But the Reynolds number cannot always be clearly defined in equipment 
of the type used in extraction, and furthermore it is not usually so clear an 
indication of the degree of turbulence as in simpler fluid systems. For a 
given apparatus and liquid system, where fluid properties vary little with 
operating conditions, Eq. (10.10) can be written 

1 1,1 (lon) 



K c a 

where the expressions on the right-hand side each represent the individual- 
film resistances to mass transfer. A similar expression can be written 
for K&amp;a. 



314 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

It is then necessary to establish the numerical value of the various con- 
stants from a study of the experimental data. This will ordinarily be 
successful only if one of the exponents equals zero. For example, if 7 were 
zero and the flow rate of the continuous phase had no influence on the mass 
transfer coefficient of the dispersed phase, then the various data could be 
grouped into series in each of which the value of UD is constant. Then, 
for each such series 



and T could be obtained by various graphical treatments of the data (13, 82). 
The other constants could then be determined in a similar manner. None 
of the graphical treatments is very useful, since ordinarily the data are not 
nearly sufficiently precise to make them applicable. Sometimes the mass- 
transfer resistance of one of the phases can be eliminated or made very small 
by a rapid and irreversible chemical reaction, for example, so that ^ becomes 
zero and a simple logarithmic plotting of Kca against Uc will establish the 
value of T. 

Alternately, Eqs. (8.7) and (8.9) indicate that HTU's should be less 
sensitive to flow rates than the mass-transfer coefficients. Equations (8.46) 
and (8.47) have been therefore used as correlating devices, on the assump- 
tion that HTUc and HTUo are each substantially independent of flow rate. 
Thus, 

HTUoc = HTUc + -^77- HTU D (10.13) 



HTUon ?= HTU D + HTUc (10.14) 

Uc 

and plotting HTUoo against mUo/Uc on arithmetic coordinates should 
give a straight line whose intercept is HTUo and whose slope is HTUc. 
This is not always too successful, since on occasions negative intercepts result 
which cannot readily be interpreted. Nevertheless, these simple plots are 
useful for empirical correlation even if they cannot be interpreted in terms 
of HTU D and HTU C . 

Wetted-wall Towers. As indicated previously, these have been used in 
laboratory investigations where it was desired to exert some control over 
the interfacial area, but it is not likely that they will be useful in industrial 
work. The significant results will be summarized here only briefly. 

Fallah, Hunter, Nash, and Strang (27, 77) studied the hydraulics of 
wetted-wall towers operated with stationary liquid cores composed of 
hydrocarbons and a moving wall-liquid of water. It was clearly shown 
that the interface and a portion of the core liquid immediately adjacent to 
the interface moved downward in the direction of the flow of wall-liquid.

Later, Treybal and Work (82) made similar studies with a moving benzene 
core and water as a wall-liquid, establishing that the core velocity also 
influenced the interfacial velocity, although the interfacial velocity was 
always in the direction of flow of the wall-liquid. These studies have made 
it clear that each phase has an influence on the flow conditions of the other 
and that the core-liquid is never completely stationary even at zero net 
flow. Similar conclusions were drawn by Bergelin, Lockhart, and Brown 
(8), who used a nearly horizontal tube with water and tetrachloroethylene 
flowing countercurrently in the upper and lower halves. 

Hunter, et al. (28, 78) studied the extraction of phenol from kerosene as a 
core-liquid, with water as a wall-liquid, both liquids in turbulent flow. 
The data were interpreted by an equation similar to Eq. (10.12), and it was 
concluded that, over the limited range studied, the wall-liquid did not 
influence the mass-transfer coefficient for the core. Working with the 
liquids benzene and water over a wide range of flow rates for each, with 
acetic acid as the diCm-iim solute, Treybal and Work (82) showed that an 
equation at least as complex as Eq. (10.11) was necessary to describe the 
results and were therefore unable to determine the value of the constants. 
These observations reinforced the conclusions respecting the influence of 
each rate of flow on the degree of turbulence in both liquids. 

Comings and Briggs (20) studied the extraction of several solutes between 
benzene and water. For the extraction of benzoic acid, where the distribu- 
tion favors the benzene, the major resistance to diffusion lay in the water 
phase. Addition of sodium hydroxide to the water reduced this resistance 
by causing a rapid chemical reaction, increased the mass-transfer coefficient, 
and made the effect of benzene rate on the over-all coefficient more pro- 
nounced, as would be expected. Similar experiences were obtained in the 
case of extraction of aniline, but in the case of acetic acid results were con- 
trary to what was expected. The data apparently could be interpreted in 
terms of Eq. (10.11), with = 0.45 - 0.55, 7 = 0- 0.1, rj = 0.40 - 0.55, 
r = 0.45 0.55. Brinsmade and Bliss (13) extracted acetic acid from 
methyl isobutyl ketone (core) by water (wall). By making measurements 
at several temperatures, they were able to investigate the influence of 
Schmidt number on the rates and by graphical treatment of the data ob- 
tained values of the constants of Eq. (10.11) as follows: ft = 1, t\ = 7 = 0, 
r = 0.67, &lt; = S = 0.62. Despite visual indication of violent wave motion 
in the experiments, neither flow rate apparently influenced the mass trans- 
fer coefficient of the other phase. On the other hand, Bergelin, et al. (8), 
in the horizontal apparatus mentioned above, did observe the mutual 
influence of flow rates on the coefficients which their flow studies would 
predict. 

The observations from these investigations are curiously conflicting and 
cannot be reconciled at this time.

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



Extraction from Single Drops. Extraction from isolated liquid drops as 
they rise or fall through an immiscible liquid can provide an insight into 
the fundamental mechanism pertaining in spray, perforated-plate, and 
packed towers, since for the drops the interfacial surface can be estimated 
and treated separately from the mass-transfer coefficients. Sherwood, 
Evans, and Longcor (76) extracted acetic acid from methyl isobutyl ketone 
and benzene with water in this manner, with single drops issuing from 
nozzles and rising through various depths of quiet water. Some of their 
data are indicated in curves 1 and 2 of Fig. 10.20. Extrapolation of these 
curves to zero tower height indicates an appreciable residual amount of 
extraction. Licht and Conway (53) have postulated that the extraction in

such a tower can be divided into three portions, that which occurs (a) during 
drop formation at the nozzle, (6) during rise or fall of the drop, and (c) on 
coalescence of the drop into the interface at the other end of the tower. 
They extracted acetic acid from drops of water falling through three solvents 
in two devices, the first of which gave all three effects. Some of their data 
are indicated in curve 3 of the figure, and the intercept at zero height 
should show the extraction due to the first and third effects, as for curve 1. 
The second apparatus (curve 4) eliminated the coalescence effect, and the 
intercept should represent extraction during drop formation only. The 
vertical difference between the curves (3 to 4) should then represent the 
extraction occurring only during fall of the drops. 

The over-all coefficients measured by Sherwood (76), plotted as a func- 
tion of drop size in Fig. 10.21, indicate a strong effect of initial solute con-

the effect on the fluid properties. The drops were not perfectly spherical 
and underwent a certain degree of deformation as they rose through the

water, depending upon their size and interfacial tension. This was con- 
firmed by a comparison of the molecular diffusivity of acetic acid in the 
solvents and the diffusivity which would have to be used in Eq. (5.27) to 
compute the extent of extraction assuming purely unsteady-state diffusion 
in the drops with no resistance in the continuous phase. The latter values 
were greater than the former by factors of 11 to 43, increasing with increased 
drop size and decreased interfacial ten- 
sion, thus indicating the presence of eddy 
currents within the drop. 

The extraction rates of Licht and Con- 
way could be related to each portion of 
the process. Thus it was observed that 
the per cent of total extraction which 
occurred during drop coalescence was 6, 
11, and 13 per cent for isopropyl ether, 
ethyl acetate, and methyl isobutyl ketone 
as solvents, respectively, irrespective of 
drop size over the limited range studied. 
Figure 10.22 shows the extraction coef- 
ficients during drop formation, and since 
the fractional extraction was constant in 

each system for each drop size, the variation of K D with drop size is due 
to the variation of interfacial area. The values of KD for the period while 
the drops were falling were reasonably independent of tower height, but

the ratio of effective diffusivity to molecular diffusivity cannot be computed 
for the drops in the manner described above, since evidently an appreciable 
portion of the diffusional resistance lies in the continuous phase leading to 
ratios considerably less than unity. 

End Effects. While the available data do not yet permit quantitative 
calculation for all situations, the existence of very sizable end effects, as 
the phenomena described above are called, is nevertheless firmly established. 

Extraction coefficients for spray towers, 
consequently, might be expected to be 
smaller, and HTU's larger, with in- 
creased height. This is confirmed by 
the data of Nandi and Viswanathan 
(61), Fig. 10.23, where the values of 
HTU and Ka tend to level off at in- 
creasing tower heights as the end effect 
becomes decreasingly important. The 
change in interfacial surface with acid 
concentration and different dispersed 
phase is probably largely responsible 
for the effect of these variables on the 
extraction rates. Johnson and Bliss 
(46) noted very small effects of tower 
height in extracting acetic acid from 
water by methyl isobutyl ketone. In 
the extraction of ferric chloride from 
aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid 
by isopropyl ether in a spray column, 
Geankoplis and Hixson (30) used an 
ingenious internal sampling device to 
determine the end effects shown in Fig. 
10.24. The end effect was apparently 
caused entirely by the coalescence of 

ether droplets at the interface and none by dispersion at the inlet ether 
nozzle, the absence of which is difficult to explain. Varying the rates of 
flow of the continuous phase and changing the position and cross section of 
the tower at the interface had no apparent influence. On the other hand, 
concentration of solute which through interfacial tension affects the ease of 
coalescence, and rate of flow of dispersed phase which changes the number 
of droplets are both important. 

Spray Towers. The performance of a spray tower will be a function of 
the variation of the individual mass-transfer coefficients A; of the two phases 
and the interfacial area a with operating conditions. The value of k for the 
dispersed phase can be expected to depend on drop size, diffusivity, and

such physical properties as viscosity, density, and interfacial tension which 
influence turbulence within the drop but should be relatively independent 
of continuous phase rate. The value of fc for the continuous phase can be 
expected to be influenced by the diffusivity and the viscosity, density, and 
rates of flow of both phases as these in turn influence turbulence. The 
variation of interfacial area, which will depend upon drop size and dispersed- 
phase hold-up, can be expected to be a most important factor and may en- 
tirely mask the influence of the variables on k. All the data representing

systematic investigation of these effects were obtained on laboratory-sized 
equipment, usually a few inches in diameter at the most. This is perhaps 
not so serious, since the wall effect in the absence of packing is probably 
not very great. 

The recent work of Laddha and Smith (51), who used a technique 
developed by Colburn and Welsh (19), is most illuminating since it presents 
data on the individual phase resistances. In this procedure two pure 
liquids of limited solubility are contacted in the absence of a third solute, 
and the approach to saturation of each phase can be calculated in terms of 
the individual resistances. The operation is analogous to contacting a pure 
gas with a pure liquid in .!, . - , , - - ' ' studies, whereby gas-film resistances 
alone are obtained. Laddha and Smith used isobutyraldehyde and 3-pen- 
tanol with water in a 2-in.-diameter tower and were able to obtain data for 
all but the pure aldehyde film. The dispersed-phase coefficients are shown 
in Fig. 10.25 as a function of dispersed-phase rate. In two of the cases, 
where the continuous-phase rate was relatively low, the coefficients appear 
to depend upon dispersed phase rate only. In the third, the influence of 
higher continuous-phase rates on dispersed-phase hold-up and interfacial

area is evident. Values of fcca, Fig. 10.26, are of the same order of magni- 
tude as those of k D a, as would be expected. They are again more dependent 
upon the rate of the dispersed than the continuous phase, and interfacial

area probably plays the predominant role. The values of H TU are shown 
in Fig. 10.27, where the ratio L D /L C correlates all the data for a given 
operation very well. The slopes of these curves can be anticipated from 
the appearance of the figures and Eqs. (8.7) and (8.9), but the relative

dominant factor is the interfacial area. 

The remaining operating data on spray towers are limited to over-all 
coefficients or HTU's, for which interpretation is frequently difficult. The 
very great influence of interfacial area on the extraction rate has been noted

benzole acid from a dispersed toluene solution by water. At constant rate 
for the continuous phase, the coefficients are plotted against dispersed 
phase rate for three different inlet nozzles which produced various drop 
sizes for the toluene. With each extraction curve is included another show- 
ing the dispersed phase hold-up, indicative to some extent of the interfacial 
area. In the case of the largest drops, for which the size and rate of rise 
were found to be constant, the coefficient is essentially independent of dis- 
persed-phase rate and the curve parallels the corresponding hold-up data 
almost exactly. In the case of the smaller drops, the coefficients are larger

Similarly in Fig. 10.29, where the data are plotted against rate of flow of 
continuous phase at constant dispersed-phase rate, the great influence of 
interfacial area is evident. For the large drops it was observed that their 
very rapid rate of rise was not influenced by the rate of the continuous 
phase; hold-up and coefficients therefore remain constant. For the smaller 
drops the rate of rise was markedly reduced by increased flow of the con- 
tinuous phase, hold-up increased, and interfacial area and coefficients in-

creased. For the smallest toluene drops, considerable coalescence was 
observed at the higher water rates, which increases the rate of drop rise, 
decreases hold-up and interfacial surface, and lowers the coefficient. It is 
therefore evident that the rate of extraction for any system is very greatly 
dependent upon these factors, perhaps more so than on any others. 

All the available data for the extraction of benzoic acid from toluene in 
a spray tower are shown in Fig. 10.30, grouped according to the size of 
the distributor nozzles for the dispersed phase and consequently accord-

ing to drop size. The correlation is essentially empirical; the distribution 
coefficient might perhaps be included in the abscissa, but for the dilute 
solutions used it is essentially the same for all the data. Only in the case 
of four runs at the highest water rate for the -Hie-in- distributor is there any 
indication of segregation according to flow rate, and these give slightly 
lower values of HTU. The drop size for this distributor, while not re- 
corded, can be estimated as roughly the same as that for the Spray co nozzle 
of Appel and Elgin, and the coincidence of these data indicate the insig- 
nificant effect of tower diameter for the sizes used. The plot shows par- 
ticularly the remarkable range of HTU's obtainable for a given system and 
demonstrates the inadvisability of attempting to generalize the numerical 
value of this quantity. Values of H.E.T.S. computed from the original data 
are of the same order of magnitude as the HTU'a but cannot be so well 
correlated.

in the direction water-to-ether always leads to lower HTU's, probably be- 
cause of a decreased drop size. Likewise, small increases in rate of extrac- 
tion at increased acid concentration in the water phase were noted and could 
be ascribed to the decrease in drop size with decreased interfacial tension. 
A few data with larger nozzle diameters for the dispersed phase (not shown) 
indicated, as might be expected, lower rates of extraction.

vides the data of Fig. 10.32. For either phase dispersed, increasing the rate

traction seems unimportant, while for water dispersed slightly lower HTU'a 
result if the direction is ketone-to-water, although this is not well estab- 
lished. The major point brought out by Johnson and Bliss (46) in this work 
is the importance of proper distributor nozzles. Not only are the diameters 
of the nozzles important, but equally so is the use of a sufficient number to 
ensure reasonably uniform drop size. This results in less coalescence and 
lower HTU's. The apparently anomalous results described by curve 3 
can very probably be assigned to this factor. Hayworth and Treybal (36) 
found that uniform drop size can be expected from sharp-edged nozzles of 
diameters between 0.059 and 0.31 in. provided that the linear velocity of 
flow through the nozzle is not greater than approximately 0.3 ft./sec.

Figure 10.33 presents the data of Geankoplis and Hixson (30) for the inter- 
esting case of extraction of an inorganic salt, corrected for the end effects 
shown in Fig. 10.24. The HTU's so corrected are practically independent 
of position in the tower. The concentration effect is probably caused by 
the influence of interfacial tension on drop size, which becomes unimportant 
as the rate of the dispersed phase increases and in turn governs the inter- 
facial area.

Heat Transfer. The use of an extraction tower to transfer heat between 
the dispersed and continuous liquids is an interesting variation of the opera- 
tions under consideration. Rosenthal (69) and the author have found this 
a convenient means of comparing the tower performances for different 
conditions of operation. Typical spray-tower data are shown in Fig. 10.34,

taken from a tower with end designs similar to those of Fig. 10.2. f The 
similarity between the performance curves for heat transfer and extraction 
is obvious, although the sudden drop in values of HTUoo at high values of 
LD has not been observed in extraction, and there appears to be a somewhat 
lesser dependency on distributor nozzle diameter. Over-all heat-transfer 
coefficients (Ua) calculated from the same data seem completely inde- 
pendent of continuous-phase rate over the range investigated, and values

of H.E.T.S. vary from 2.0 to 8.6 ft. for the larger nozzles, from 1.3 to 5.6 ft. 
for the smaller. The utility of this type of heat transfer in continuous fat 
splitting is indicated by Allen, et al. (1), who report some heat-transfer data 
for the system fatty acids-water. Over a limited range of flow rates, J^-in.- 
ring packing gave over-all values of HTU calculated in the water phase of 
3.2 to 3.6 ft., while the tray construction of Fig. 10.10 gave values of 
0.7 to 1.3 ft. 

Packed Towers. The introduction of packing into a tower may influ- 
ence the rate of extraction in several ways. The packing particles hinder 
the rising droplets; consequently the hold-up of dispersed-phase and inter-

facial area is larger, and turbulence in the continuous phase will be in- 
creased. The coefficients are consequently larger for the packed tower than 
for a spray tower, for comparable operating conditions. The packing also 
regulates the size of the droplets of dispersed phase, to some extent, so that 
the influence of the distributor nozzle design is less important. In certain 
systems with high interfacial tension and a strong preferential wetting of 
the packing by the dispersed phase, there are no droplets. Instead the dis- 
persed phase flows along the packing surface in rivulets whose surface area 
changes relatively little with flow rate. The operating characteristics in such 
cases can be very different from those first described, and an interchange of 
dispersion of the phases can have profound effects on the rate of extraction. 
Individual-film coefficients and HTU's in packed towers have been 
measured by Colbura and Welsh (19) and Laddha and Smith (51), using 
the technique previously described. Typical mass-transfer coefficients are 
shown in Fig. 10.35 for the system 3-pentanol-water, where the rate of the 



330 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



continuous phase seems to have no influence. At higher flow rates, where 
the hold-up might be increased by increased values of LC, an effect might be 
anticipated. Typical HTU's are shown in Fig. 10.36, correlated in the 
manner used for spray towers, and a summary of all the single-film data is 
given in Table 10.3. In every case HTUo is practically constant, inde- 
pendent of flow rate of either phase, while HTUc is a strong function of 
flow rates. Variation in the value of HTU from one system to another 
cannot be entirely reconciled on the basis of diffusivities, and the variation 
of interfacial area due to dispersion differences probably exerts the major 
influence. Comparison with the data for spray towers shows in most cases 
a 20 to 25 per cent lowering of the HTU's by the packing.

FIG. 10.36. Individual-film HTU'a for packed towers. 

The remaining data representing the results of systematic tests are over- 
all extraction coefficients and HTU's. These were all taken from labora- 
tory-sized equipment, and in many of these tests the tower diameter was 
too small to give a normal packing density. Numerical values of rates of 
extraction in such cases must be used with caution when applied to larger 
towers. The importance of this is corroborated by the observations of 
Gloyer (31), who reports on the extraction of vegetable oils with furfural 
in packed towers of 2, 22, and 66 in. in diameter. The effectiveness of unit 
height for the two large diameters was essentially the same but noticeably 
greater for the 2-in.-diameter tower. 

The parallel in the variation of extraction rate and hold-up of dispersed 
phase with flow rate has been noted by several investigators. The data of 
Sherwood, et al. (76) on the extraction of acetic acid from water by benzene,

Fig. 10.37, is indicative. For three of the curves, with benzene as the dis- 
persed phase, the coefficient increases with increased rate of continuous 
phase owing to increased hold-up of dispersed-phase droplets. At the 
higher rates of flow, considerable coalescence then reduced the interfacial 
area, and the coefficients fell rapidly. The strong influence of dispersed- 
phase rate is also evident. For the case where water was dispersed, it 
preferentially wet the carbon ring packing and flowed along the packing 
surface in rivulets as previously described. The hold-up and consequently

the coefficient are much less influenced by rate of flow. The higher coef- 
ficients obtained when the dispersed phase does not wet the packing make 
this an important consideration in the choice of dispersed phase. Similar 
phenomena were observed by Meissner, et al. (57), whose data for the ex- 
traction of water from methyl ethyl ketone by calcium chloride brine are 
summarized in Table 10.4; the brine preferentially wet the ceramic packing, 
and when it was the dispersed phase not only were the coefficients lower but 
they were much less dependent upon the continuous-phase flow rate.f 

t On the other hand, Berg, et al. (7), in extracting methyl ethyl ketone from naphtha 
by water, found that regardless of the preferential wetting lower values of H.E.T.S. 
resulted with water dispersed.

The extraction of benzoic acid from toluene by water provided the data 
for Fig. 10.38, representing tests on a variety of packings. These data are 
correlated in the empirical fashion previously used, which seems to be able 
to handle large variations in flow rates for either phase. The standard 
packings (rings and saddles) give better HTU's than the knit copper cloth,

except when the cloth is tightly rolled (curve 4). The inferior flooding 
characteristics make this packing impractical, however. The lesser influ- 
ence of the design of the dispersed-phase distributor, in comparison to 
its importance in spray towers, is evident, and the variation in HTU's 
for ring and saddle packing for the two investigators is more likely due to 
the different packing densities obtained in the two cases, as observed by 
Gloyer (31). Although the variation in HTU with flow rates is quite as 
large as for spray towers, the variation with type of packing is relatively 
small for the standard packings. A few data of Appel and Elgin (3) for 
water as the dispersed phase are summarized in Table 10.4.

The very large values of HTUoc indicated in Fig. 10.38, together with 
the previous observation that HTU D is relatively small and independent of 
flow rate (Table 10.3) indicates that the great majority of the diffusional 
resistance probably lies in the continuous phase for this system. This is 
corroborated by the data of Fig. 10.39, where the extractions of benzoic 
acid from dispersed kerosene, toluene, and benzene are all nearly brought 
together by the inclusion of the distribution coefficient in the abscissa, as

suggested by Eq. (10.13). Exclusion of this term spreads the data con- 
siderably, as indicated by the empirical equations for each system. The 
interfacial tensions for these systems are all nearly alike, and consequently 
the interfacial areas are all roughly the same. 

A comprehensive set of data on the contacting of water and vinyl acetate 
was obtained by Pratt and Glover (65), with acetone and acetaldehyde as 
distributed solutes, Fig. 10.40. The water preferentially wet the packing, 
and when dispersed formed the rivulets on the packing previously described. 
In addition to the empirical correlations of the figure, Pratt and Glover

showed that the data could be expressed by the following equations, in the

FIG. 10.40. Extraction of acetone and acetaldehyde from vinyl acetate with water in a packed 
tower, 1.78 in. diam., 10-mm. rings (65). 

Values of H.E.T.S. for the case where vinyl acetate was dispersed varied 
from 4.5 to 5.5 ft. (acetone extracted) and from 5.5 to 6.3 ft. (acetaldehyde 
extracted). For water dispersed, H.E.T.S. varied from 4.1 to 7.1 ft. 

The effect of temperature on extraction rates was investigated by Morello 
and Beckmann (58), whose data on the system diethylamine-toluene-water 
are summarized in Table 10.4. Most of the variation in temperature can 
be taken care of by inclusion of the distribution coefficient in the correlating 



CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT EQUIPMENT 337 

equations, as shown, but significant differences still remain which at this 
time can only be expressed in empirical fashion. The effect of addition of 
surface active agents to reduce the interfacial tension in the extraction of 
benzoic acid from benzene with water was investigated by Chu, Taylor, and. 
Levy (16), who found a lowering of the over-all HTU with lowered inter- 
facial tension in most instances. Increase of HTU in some cases was 
explained by the assumption of an increased interfacial diffusion resistance 
due to the adsorbed molecules of surface active agent at the interface. 
The data cannot be completely regularized. 

Rushton (71), working with lubricating oil and nitrobenzene, studied 
extraction using a variety of packings in a 2.94-in.-diameter tower and 
obtained values of H.E.T.S. varying from 1.5 to 4.6 ft. over a wide range of 
operating conditions. With high viscosity oil, large packing was found 
most desirable, but as extraction proceeded and viscosity was reduced, 
smaller packing became more effective. Most of the data were therefore 
taken with a " graded " packing, using different sizes in various sections of 
the tower, and this arrangement gave the most effective extraction. Values 
of H.E.T.S. increased with ratio of solvent to oil and with raffinate rate. 
Slight improvement was noticed for a dispersed solvent phase. 

Most of the remaining data are summarized in Table 10.4. The empirical 
equations are of course limited in applicability to the conditions pertaining 
in the various tests. Additional data on small packings suitable for labora- 
tory extractions in towers of small diameter are available in the works of 
Varteressian and Fenske (84), Ney and Lochte (62), and Hou and Franke 
(39). 

Baffle Towers. No systematic investigation of these has been reported. 
For designs of the type of Fig. 10.5, with baffle spacing of 4 to 6 in. in 
columns of 3 to 6 ft. in diameter, roughly 12 baffles are equivalent to a 
theoretical stage (33), dependent of course on the design and system. 
Hixson and Bockelmann (37) report that a baffle tower constructed of a 
2.5-in. pipe, with baffles occupying 70 per cent of the cross section and 
placed 3 in. apart, gave values of H.E.T.S. of 2.1 to 4.7 ft. in the extraction 
of oleic acid from refined cottonseed oil by liquid propane at 175 to 200F. 

Perforated-plate Towers. The few systematic investigations that have 
been made with perforated-plate towers are summarized in Fig. 10.41 and 
Table 10.5. The distribution coefficient has been included in the abscissa 
of the figure in order to permit comparison particularly between the toluene 
and kerosene systems, and the data are compared with the results from ring- 
packed towers. It is noteworthy that, whereas both of these liquids gave 
approximately the same rate of extraction with carbon rings, the perforated 
plates gave better results with kerosene and slightly poorer results with 
toluene. Roughly equal flow capacities for both rings and plates are possi- 
ble for the kerosene, while somewhat greater capacity for the toluene is 



338 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



possible with the plates, although the flow capacities are greatly dependent 
on the plate design. The data for extraction of methyl .ethyl ketone from 
gasoline by water and those for extraction of acetic acid by ethyl ether 
i&gt;oth involve systems of lower interfacial tension than the others. Dis- 
persion into smaller drops and consequently improved extraction result. 
Unfortunately there are no data for these systems in other types of towers 
for comparison.

Fio. 10.41. Extraction in perforated-plate towers. 

The effect of plate spacing has been studied for several systems. Moul- 
ton and Walkey (60) used 3- and 6-in. spacings, and as shown in Fig. 10.41, 
the 3-in. spacing which causes more frequent redispersion of the light 
liquid gives improved results. Treybal and Dumoulin (81) used 3-, 6-, and 
9-in. spacings, and the summaries of their data in Table 10.5 show, by the 
coefficients in the empirical equations, that much greater improvement 
results from a change of 6 to 3 in. than 9 to 6. This is to be expected in the 
light of the studies that have been made of the end effects in spray towers. 
Similarly, Pyle, et al. (66) investigated spacings of 2.5 to 20 in. and found 
higher extraction efficiencies per plate at the greater spacings but lower 
separating effect per unit height of tower, with little change in plate effi- 
ciency at spacings greater than 8 in.

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



The effect of perforation size has been studied by Row, Koffolt, and 
Withrow (70) (Table 10.5) and Pyle, et al (66), who also studied the effect 
of varying the percentage cross section devoted to the perforations (Fig. 
10.42). The extraction rate is influenced relatively little by hole diameter 
but is increased by increased free area for flow. The latter factor also has 
a profound influence on the flow capacities, as discussed earlier. 

Perforated plates of conical design were tried by Row, et al. (70) who 
found that they give essentially the same results as flat plates with the same 
perforation size. A few data on the relative efficiency of removal of phenol

from aqueous ammonia liquor by benzene are given by Hoening (38), who 
obtained a 73 per cent removal with perforated plates (water dispersed) 
and 25-mm. rings, 70 per cent with 60-mm. rings, and 55 per cent with a 
spray tower, 6 m. tall. Hunter and Nash (43) report a similar comparison 
between a spray and perforated-plate tower. A few data from an experi- 
mental Koch tower (Fig. 10.9) show tray efficiencies of 50 to 90 per cent 
in sweetening gasoline (29, 40). 

Spinner Column. Recent tests on an 11.5-in.-diameter tower of 
Scheibers design (Fig. 10.11) have been reported (73), and a few of the data 
are shown in Fig. 10.43. The data were all taken at such flow rates that 
the operating lines and equilibrium curves were essentially parallel, so that 
the values of over-all HTU apply to concentration gradients in either phase 
and are numerically equal to values of H.E.T.S. A stage was considered to 
include one agitator together with one packed section for the purposes of 
computing stage efficiencies. While the data are too few for extensive 



CONTINUOUS COUNTERCURRENT EQUIPMENT

generalizations, it appears that the column performance is less dependent 
upon ratios of flow rates than are those of ordinary packed towers but greatly 
dependent upon speed of the agitator. For the 9-in. packed sections, little 
improvement in extraction is obtained beyond an agitator speed of 400 
r.p.m., and increasing the speed too greatly causes emulsification and 
flooding Additional effects, such as those of liquid throughout, are dis- 
cussed by Scheibel and Karr (73). In the case of the methyl isobutyl 
ketone-water-acetic acid system, a comparison of the performance of this

novel device with that of the more conventional towers is shown in Fig. 
10.44. The spray tower is much more susceptible to changes in dispersed 
phase than the agitated column and, as might be expected, gives a poorer 
performance. The system is one of low interfacial tension and is easily 
dispersed; apparently the conventional packings will do as well as the agi- 
tated column, at least at the flow rates for which comparison data are 
available. This may be due to failure of the mesh packing to break the 
emulsion formed by the agitator, resulting in some recirculation. Addi- 
tional data for a laboratory-sized (l-in.-diameter) column, showing very 
low values of H.E.T.S., are also available (72). 

Centrifugal Extractor. No systematic tests of the Podbieiniak extractor 
have been reported. From 8 to 12 equivalent stages have been obtained

per machine in the extraction of n-butylamine between a naphtha and 
water (48), but these will vary at least with flow rate and system. Bartels 
and Kleiman (6) indicate 4 stages per machine in the extraction of strep- 
tomycin with amyl alcohol containing 15 per cent lauric acid from a buffered 
solution.

CHAPTER 11 
LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 

In this chapter no attempt will be made to treat all possible liquid-extrac- 
tion processes nor even to discuss in an exhaustive manner those which are 
considered. The very rapid growth of the extraction applications would 
soon make any such treatment obsolete. Instead, typical industrial appli- 
cations will be considered briefly for the purposes of indicating their fre- 
quently complex nature and the special usefulness of extraction as a separa- 
tion technique. 

PETROLEUM REFINING 

Petroleum is a mixture of literally thousands of compounds, principally 
hydrocarbons of various types, with small percentages of compounds of 
sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. These are initially separated by distillation 
into a variety of products on the basis of boiling point, which are then 
further refined and altered to provide various finished products such as 
gasoline and other fuels, lubricants, waxes, and asphalts. In the course of 
the initial separation and refining, the chemical nature of the original com- 
pounds is frequently changed. 

Various compounds havijig different chemical properties and different 
physical properties such as density and viscosity occur in the same boiling 
ranges. Consequently the initial separation by distillation, with a few 
exceptions, makes substantially no segregation according to chemical type. 
Separation of these by action of various chemical reagents has long been 
used; for example, the action of sulfuric acid on unsaturated hydrocarbons. 
The reaction products formed with such reagents not only are frequently 
useless, thus representing a considerable loss of petroleum material, but also 
may introduce difficult problems of regenerating the chemical reagents and 
disposal of the reaction products. Separation by liquid extraction wherein 
solvents preferentially dissolve the various compounds according to chemi- 
cal type without chemical reaction, thus permitting complete recovery of 
the solvents and the substance separated, obviously offers distinct advan- 
tages. This has long been recognized: successful industrial extraction of 
kerosenes in Rumania was established in 1909 with the process of Edeleanu 
(38), and as early as 1863 the use of fusel oil for kerosene extraction was 
suggested (165). Except for the various Edeleanu applications, however, 
most of the developments have been relatively recent.

LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 347 

The many refinery operations involving contact of the petroleum frac- 
tions with insoluble liquids which either bring about reversible or irreversi- 
ble chemical action between reagent and parts of the oil, or which act purely 
by selective solution, are all generally carried out in conventional extraction 
equipment of the sort described in the previous chapter. Indeed, much of 
this equipment was first developed for these processes. Most of these 
operations are very adequately described in the many texts on petroleum 
technology (90, 93, 128), and discussion here will be limited to only a few. 

EXTRACTION OF NAPHTHAS 

Edeleanu Process. The first commercially successful application of ex- 
traction of petroleum-refining processes was established by Edeleanu (38, 
39) , who extracted aromatic hydrocarbons from kerosenes with liquid sulfur 
dioxide to improve their burning qualities. The solvent is extremely 
selective for this purpose and acts without chemical reaction. 

Kerosenes contain paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbons, 
which for the present purposes can be grouped as aromatics and nonaro- 
matics. Defize (33) presents a large number of phase diagrams on this 
basis, showing the configurations of Type 1 systems, Fig. 2.8, where A 
represents the nonaromatic and C the aromatic hydrocarbons, with B the 
sulfur dioxide. For a typical kerosene, the binary critical solution tempera- 
ture between nonaromatics and solvent is 45C. (113F.), but at 10C. 
(14F.) the solubility is small, and the binodal curve extends well into the 
triangular plot. Treatment of kerosene is customarily carried out between 
10 and 20F., somewhat higher temperatures being necessary for higher 
boiling distillates. No preferential selectivity for the various aromatic 
hydrocarbons in a given kerosene is apparent, and the nonaromatics are 
almost all equally insoluble (50). At the same time that the aromatics are 
preferentially extracted, sulfur compounds, particularly of the cyclic type 
such as thiophene, are also concentrated in the extract, and Brandt (19) 
indicates the extent of removal of these that can be expected. Nitrogen 
compounds are also removed (37d). 

The early Edeleanu plants used two or three mixer-settler stages operated 
in countercurrent, but, in 1924, continuous contacting in tower extractors 
was introduced. Other parts of the process have also been modified and 
improved in the many years that it has been in use, and the simplified flow- 
sheet of Fig. 11.1 indicates typical equipment arrangements. The charge 
to be treated is filtered and dried to remove water, which will otherwise form 
a solid hydrate with the solvent. The hydrate not only clogs distributors 
in the extraction towers but also leads to corrosion of the steel equipment 
when later it decomposes at higher process temperatures. After being 
chilled to extraction temperature, the charge is extracted in two towers with 
cold liquid sulfur dioxide. The extract and raffinate solutions, after heat 



348 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



exchange with incoming charge and solvent, are sent to separate series of 
multiple evaporators operating at pressures of 150 Ib/sq. in. to 25 mm. Hg 
abs. The relative volatility of the solvent is so high that excellent solvent 
removal is obtained. The sulfur dioxide from the evaporators is collected, 
dried, compressed, and liquefied for reuse. Finished extract and raffinate 
may then be treated with sulfuric acid for more complete desulfurization, 
or caustic-washed to remove traces of sulfur dioxide. Solvent/charge 
ratios vary between 1 and 2, depending upon the charge stock, and solvent 
losses are customarily less than 0.1 per cent of the charge.

By 1936, 40 plants of this general type were in operation, treating more 
than 180,000 bbl./day of kerosene (33). Diesel fuels may also be treated 
by this process to remove aromatic compounds which impair the ignition 
qualities of the fuel. A description of a recent installation is given by 
Dickey (34), and a thorough study of applications and a very complete 
bibliography is given by Defize (33). Furfural may also be used for this 
purpose (94). 

Recovery of Aromatics. A most interesting adaptation of the Edeleanu 
process was used during the Second World War for production of toluene 
and other aromatic hydrocarbons for high-octane-number aviation fuels. 
A description of the process as used at the Abadan refinery of the Anglo- 
Persian Oil Co. is given by Moy (124). The ordinary Edeleanu process, 
since it operates with Type 1 phase diagrams, cannot produce a concentra-

tion of aromatics in the extract much higher than about 75 per cent without 
operating at excessively low temperatures. When the demand for an ex- 
tract containing at least 95 per cent aromatics developed, operation at 
temperatures of 60 or 70F. was discarded as requiring excessive refrig- 
eration and involving other difficulties with common materials of construc- 
tion. Further, the 25 per cent or so of paraffinic and naphthenic hydro- 
carbons in the extract cannot be separated by distillation from the aromatics 
because they have the same boiling range. Instead, the nonaromatics are 
replaced by others of a much lower volatility by contacting the SO2-contain-

ing extract with a paraffinic kerosene of the necessary boiling range. 
Subsequent separation of the aromatics of the required purity is then possi- 
ble. Although nonaromatics are lost to the second kerosene, these are 
entirely contained in the system by recycling. The principle of the process 
is similar to one described some years ago (166). 

A much-simplified flowsheet is shown in Fig. 11.2. Feedstock containing 
the appropriate aromatics (roughly 17 per cent by weight, including 
toluene, ethylbenzene, the xylenes, and others containing 9 and 10 carbon 
atoms/molecule) is chilled by propane refrigeration and extracted with 
chilled liquid S0 2 at -20 to -24F. in a 67-ft. tower. The raffinate is 
stripped of solvent and withdrawn. The primary extract is contacted in a 
100-ft. tower with a paraffinic kerosene to remove the nonaromatics and 
replace them with high-boiling hydrocarbons. The secondary extract is 



350 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

stripped of its 862 and distilled to remove the aromatic product, and the 
kerosene is then recycled. The raffinate from the second extraction is 
stripped of S0 2 and fractionated to produce the high-boiling kerosene as 
bottoms which is recycled to the second extractor, and the low-boiling 
aromatics as distillate. These are recycled to the first extractor. Sulfur 
dioxide is stripped from the various streams in multistage fractionators 
rather than the older type evaporators, is collected and reused. 

By feeding the extraction plant with naphthas which are rich in particular 
aromatic hydrocarbons, those produced by hydroforming for example, high 
purity of the finished aromatic product is possible. At the Baytown re- 
finery of the Humble Oil and Refining Co., nitration-grade toluene and other 
high-purity aromatic products are made by these methods, although the 
product from the extraction plant must be further treated with sulfuric 
acid and caustic to remove small amounts of olefins and diolefins (72). 

Arnold and Coghlan (6) make the interesting proposal to use water as a 
solvent to separate toluene from hydroformed naphthas of high aromatic 
content (&gt; 50 per cent toluene by volume), since the Type 2 systems 
involved then permit high-purity toluene to be obtained directly. Calcula- 
tions show the equipment required to be reasonable in size if the process 
were operated at 576F., .-ilihouuh pressures of the order of 1,700 Ib./sq. in. 
would be required to maintain the system in the liquid state. Smith and 
Funk (149) consider the suitability of a wide variety of solvents, indud'mjr 
mixed solvents. 

Butadiene. During the Second World War, the development of the 
synthetic-rubber program required the separation of relatively pure 
1,3-butadiene from other C 4 -hydrocarbons, produced for example by dehy- 
drogenation of butane, w r hen separation by ordinary distillation means 
was impossible. Extractive distillation (68), selective gas absorption, and 
liquid extraction (123) were used for this separation. In the case of the 
last, aqueous ammoniacal cuprous acetate solutions containing 3 to 3.5 
gm. moles Cu+/liter were used as solvents, which selectively extract diole- 
finic and acetylene-type hydrocarbons present in the concentrated hydro- 
carbon feed through a reversible chemical reaction with Cu^. The process 
then involved the selective M ripping of hydrocarbons other than butadiene 
from the copper solution by countercurrent contact with a butadiene-rich 
gas, followed by separate desorption of relatively pure butadiene. In the 
extraction step, towers packed with 1-in. Raschig rings were used, which 
gave the equivalent of an ideal stage for 10 to 12 ft. of height (about the 
same as for the same process operated with a gaseous hydrocarbon stream), 
or mixer-settler combinations with stage efficiencies of 75 to 100 per cent. 
Numerous details are given by Morrell, et al (123), and equilibrium data 
for other solvents are discussed by Smith and Braun (148). 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 351 

DESULFURIZATION 

The sulfur compounds in petroleum oils include hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), 
carbon disulfide (CS 2 ), mercaptans (RSH),f and thiophenols, thioethers 
(RSR'), polysulfides, thiophenes and thiophanes (heterocyclic compounds), 
and possibly others (93, 143). Elemental sulfur is sometimes found. 
These may be present in amounts ranging from a few tenths per cent 
(Pennsylvania and Mid-Continent sources), through 3 to 4 per cent 
(California and Mexico sources), to as high as 7 to 8 per cent (Iraq sources). 
The sulfur compounds are generally objectionable: hydrogen sulfide and 
mercaptans in the presence of sulfur, are corrosive; mercaptans are objec- 
tionably odoriferous; they adversely affect color and stability of the light 
distillates; they have an unfavorable influence on antiknock and oxidation 
characteristics of gasoline, particularly on the susceptibility to improvement 
of antiknock rating by tetraethyl lead; on combustion they yield corrosive 
oxidation products. For these reasons, they are generally removed, at 
least in part, or converted to the less objectionable forms. 

Hydrogen Sulfide. Extraction of the petroleum fraction with an aqueous 
solution of NaOH (5 to 15 per cent concentration) is usually used to remove 
H 2 S, frequently prior to other sulfur-removal operations. This will remove 
thiophenols as well. A line mixer (Chap. 9) followed by a settler in a one- 
stage contact, with recirculation of the caustic solution until its ability to 
remove H 2 S is spent, is usually the practice. The fouled extract, containing 
NaHS and Na2S, cannot conveniently be regenerated by heating, since the 
acidity of H2S increases with increased temperature and the caustic thus 
retains the H 2 S more firmly. Oxidation by aeration is an unsatisfactory 
alternative, and usually the fouled solution is discarded. 

Some of the standard processes used for removing H 2 S from industrial 
gases can also be adapted to extracting liquid hydrocarbons: the Girbotol 
process which uses an aqueous solution of ethanolamines (60), the Phos- 
phate process which uses aqueous potassium phosphate (99), the Alkacid 
process which uses aqueous solutions of salts of a substituted alanine (8), 
and the Koppers process which uses aqueous sodium phenolate (26). These 
solutions, which hold the H 2 S less strongly than caustic, can be regenerated 
by steam stripping or oxidation of the H 2 S and reused but will require the 
equivalent of two- or three-stage countercurrent contact for extraction. 
The flowsheets for the processes are almost identical with those considered 
under sweetening, below. 

Sweetening. Gasolines containing H 2 S and mercaptans are considered 
"sour," and the sweetening operation consists of removal of these sub- 
stances or their conversion to less offensive compounds. The mercaptan 

t R and R' represent alkyl groups.

contents of a number of gasolines from various sources have been listed by 
Happel, Cauley, and Kelly (66), typical of which are the data of Table 11.1. 
Such mercaptan distribution data represent a certain amount of simplifica- 
tion, since no indication of the secondary or tertiary types is given. The 
straight-run gasolines are generally lower in mercaptan sulfur than those 
resulting from other refinery operations. In either case, mercaptans in 
appreciable concentrations cause disagreeable odor and together with disul- 
fides lessen the response to addition of tetraethyl lead for antiknock im- 
provement, and their concentrations must be reduced. In the past, the 
extent to which sweetening was carried out, usually by conversion of mer- 
captans to disulfides, was sufficient to provide a product giving a negative 
" doctor test," a chemical test which may be sensitive to roughly 0.0004 
per cent mercaptan sulfur in the gasoline. The value of the test has been 
questioned, however, in view of the influence of disulfides on tetraethyl lead 
susceptibility (66, 107). The cost of such extensive sweetening is con- 
siderable, and in recent years there has been a tendency to consider the 
total cost of the mercaptan removal and tetraethyl lead dosage, together 
with considerations of odor, in arriving at the optimum mercaptan concen- 
tration in the product, which may then be in the neighborhood of 0.002 to 
0.005 per cent mercaptan sulfur. 

Following removal of H 2 S, the common processes either (a) oxidize the 
mercaptans to disulfides as in "doctor-treating," (6) remove practically all 
sulfur compounds including mercaptans as in acid-, clay-, or catalytic- 
treating, or (c) extract all or a part of the mercaptans without substantially 
affecting other sulfur compounds. Processes of the first type involve 
liquid-liquid contacting and can be carried out in equipment similar to that

used for extraction. They are coming into disfavor since it is now realized 
that disulfides are almost as objectionable as mercaptans. Only extraction 
processes will be considered here. 

Caustic Washing. A flowsheet of the type of Fig. 11.3 may be used, 
involving stagewise contacting. In the first extractor H 2 S is removed by a 
prewash of caustic, as outlined above. The next three stages are used for 
countercurrent extraction of the mercaptans from the gasoline with aqueous 
sodium hydroxide, and the treated gasoline is water-washed to remove

traces of caustic. The fouled caustic solution is steam-stripped for removal 
of mercaptans, the distillate decanted, and the mercaptans burned. The 
recovered caustic is recycled to the extraction stages, and the caustic enter- 
ing the first mercaptan extractor is sometimes diluted with water to reduce 
gasoline losses in the extract from this stage. Packed towers are being 
increasingly used in place of the separate stages, since they are generally 
less costly. 

The equilibrium relations existing during the distribution of a mercaptan 
between a gasoline and a solution of NaOH are indicated in Fig. 11.4. 
The various equilibria may be characterized as follows (114, 173):

where the parentheses indicate molar concentrations of the substances

and since (RSH aq ) is very small, Eq. 
(11.5) may be simplified to 



FIG. 11.4. Mercaptan equilibria. 



Coefficients Wr, m^ and K u are indicated in part in Fig. 11.5. The value 
of mr increases with increased caustic concentration, since (OH~)/(H 2 O) is 
thereby increased. The increase in the latter in turn affects the ionization 
of the mercaptan, Eq. (11.2), and lowers K u . In addition, the presence 
of higher concentrations of NaOH results in a salting out of the unionized 
mercaptan from the water phase, so that the increase in mr with caustic 
concentration is not so great as might at first be anticipated (173). For 
caustic concentrations up to about 1 normal, Eq. (11.6) can be used to 
estimate the approximate effe'ct of concentration with the data of Fig. 11.5, 
on the assumption that nil and K w (0.681 X 10~ 4 at 20 C.) remain constant 
and provided that the activity of water (partial pressure over the solu- 
tion/vapor pressure) is used for (H 2 0). A few additional data at higher 
concentrations are available (29, 173). There is little variation with molec- 
ular weight of oil, at least for the naphthas customarily considered in these 
processes. Secondary and tertiary alkyl mercaptans give lower values of 
niT than the normal compounds, and a 20F. drop in temperature increases 
WT by about 50 per cent. For dilute concentrations, the individual values 
of niT for the various mercaptans are independent and constant (67), but 
there is a considerable variation with mercaptan concentration at the higher 
values (29). For concentrated caustic solutions (e.g., 25 to 30 per cent 
NaOH), the concentration of caustic during the extraction changes so 
little that Wr for each mercaptan may be considered constant for a given 
process. 

The caustic solution used in regenerative-type plants, Fig. 11.3, will 
extract organic acids of the aromatic and naphthenic series from the gaso-

line (66). These are not stripped in the caustic recovery system, and they 
consequently build up to equilibrium concentrations in the caustic. They 
increase the distribution coefficients mr for the mercaptans very consider- 
ably, particularly for the difficultly extracted mercaptans as indicated in 
Fig. 11.5. Behavior of this sort was described by Yabroff and White 
(175), who observed that the concentration of unionized mercaptan in the 
caustic increased considerably in the presence of a wide variety of organic 
substances in the caustic solution, and who present a large number of data 
on the corresponding distributions. The nature and concentration of the 
organic material naturally influence the distribution strongly. 

The extent of extraction of mercaptans further depends upon the extent 
of their removal from the solvent in the stripper, but a general expression 
relating the extraction and stripping steps can be readily derived (65). 
Provided extracting solutions are sufficiently strong and mercaptan con- 
centration sufficiently dilute that the value of niT can be considered 
constant, Eq. (6.134) can be written for the extraction operation for each 
mercaptan: _ 



where X F concentration of RSH in the raw gasoline feed 
x n = concentration of RSH in the treated gasoline 

y, = concentration of RSH in the recovered solvent 

S = quantity of solvent per unit time 

G = quantity of gasoline per unit time 

n = number of theoretical extraction stages 
Equation (11.7) may be rearranged to read 

y* = ^ [X* - (1 - A)x r ] (11.8) 

Similarly, an equation of the same sort applies to the stripping of the 
mercaptans in the regeneration step. For each mercaptan, and for open 
steam injection into the stripper,

Illustration 1. The cracked gasoline of Table 11.1 is to be sweetened by extraction 
with a solution containing 30% NaOH, 20% organic acids, at 90F. in a plant containing 
the equivalent of two theoretical extraction stages, with a solvent circulation rate of 15% 
of the volume of the gasoline. The stripper is to contain the equivalent of three theoreti-

The results of other similar computations for different operating condi- 
tions are discussed by Happel, et ol. (66). Methods of computation for 
the extraction only, allowing for variations in ntr, are considered by Happel 
and Robertson (67) and Crary and Holm (29). 

The Solutizer process (18, 174, 175) uses as an extracting solution aqueous 
potassium hydroxide (6 normal) in which potassium isobutyrate (3 normal) 
has been dissolved. This solution gives enhanced extraction (Fig. 11.5) 
and is therefore particularly useful if the mercaptan content of the gasoline 
must be reduced to a very low value. A typical flowsheet is shown in 
Fig. 11.7 where a tower packed with 1-in. carbon rings is used for extraction. 
Border (18) gives a detailed description of a typical installation. The 
Mercapsol process (104) is similar and uses a sodium hydroxide solution 
with added naphthenic acids and cresols. The Tannin process (122) uses 
a solutizer solution with tannin, in which case the fouled solution is regen- 
erated by air-blowing.

The Unisol process (22, 47, 107, 122) uses methanol as the added agent 
to improve the caustic soda solution. Since it is soluble in gasoline, the 
flowsheet must be arranged to remove it, as in Fig. 11.8. EUS-free gasoline 
is extracted with aqueous caustic-methanol in the lower part of the packed 
extraction tower, and the methanol is extracted from the treated gasoline 
by aqueous caustic in the upper part. The combined caustic-methanol 



360 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

solution leaves the extractor fouled with mercaptans and is sent to a strip- 
per which removes methanol, water, and mercaptans overhead. Recovered 
caustic is returned to the extractor, and the wet methanol-mercaptan mix- 
ture forms two liquid layers on condensation. The mercaptan layer is 
withdrawn, and the aqueous-methanol layer, substantially mercaptan-free, 
is distilled to give methanol and water which are recycled as shown. The 
extractor uses a very low rate of extracting solvent to gasoline ( = 2-3 per 
cent) because of the high distribution coefficients of the mercaptans. 
Organic acids are extracted from the gasoline and build up to an equilibrium 
concentration in the caustic, as with the simpler processes. 

LUBRICATING OILS 

The hydrocarbons present in the lubricating-oil fractions of various petro- 
leum oils have not been entirely identified and will vary in the relative 
quantities of the different types depending upon the source of the crude. 
The major types encountered include (370, 143): 

1. Saturated straight-chain and branched paraffins, of general formula 
C n H 2n -}2. Dewaxed lubricants probably contain few pure paraffins. 

2. Olefins, or unsaturated straight-chain and branched hydrocarbons, 
C n H 2 n and C n H2 n -2. These are not present in the original crudes but may 
be made in small amounts by cracking during distillation. 

3. Naphthenes, which contain ring or cyclic structures with no double 
bonds, and with paraffinic side chains. The general formula is C n H2 n -a&gt; 
where a is the number of closed rings. 

4. Aromatics, which contain unsaturated ring structures such as those of 
benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. Unrefined lubricating-oil fractions 
contain aromatics of the series C n H2n-2 and C n H2n-4 for the lighter grades, 
and C n H2n- for the heavier. The types represented by the series CnH 2 n-io 
to C n H2n-is may also be present. 

5. Asphaltic and resinous compounds of undetermined structure. The 
hydrocarbon resins are volatile and are found in the distillate fractions, 
while the asphalts are nonvolatile. 

The actual compounds in the oil ordinarily contain mixed nuclei of all the 
major types (93). The above list is given in the order of decreasing ratio 
of hydrogen to carbon content, which is generally the order of decreasing 
desirability in the finished lubricant for reasons of viscosity-temperature 
relationships and chemical stability. 

The various organic solvents used or potentially useful in lubricant refin- 
ing are classified as either extractive or precipitative, depending upon 
whether they dissolve or reject the undesirable components. For example, 
solvents such as aniline and furfural selectively extract aromatic and naph- 
thenic hydrocarbons, with a selectivity for aromatics roughly six times as 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 361 

great as that for naphthenes relative to paraffins, as measured by critical 
solution temperatures (50). Extraction with such solvents concentrates 
the predominantly paraffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbons in the raffinate 
and the predominantly aromatic in the extract (71) . The loose terminology 
used in the industry which characterizes raffinates as paraffinic and extracts 
as naphthenic is thus basically incorrect. Precipitative solvents, such as 
propane and the lighter hydrocarbons and aliphatic alcohols, precipitate 
asphaltic compounds these solvents are selective more according to 
molecular weight than chemical type. Both extractive and precipitative 
action to some extent is probably given by all such solvents. Concentrated 
sulfuric acid was used extensively for separations of this sort prior to the 
introduction of solvent refining and is still used to some extent, especially 
for production of white (colorless) oils from lubricating fractions. The 
action of the acid involves both chemical reaction and solution, but the 
extracted substances are not recoverable and introduce difficult disposal 
problems. 

Refining Indices. Since it is impractical to analyze lubricants for the 
individual components, empirical expressions are used to indicate the degree 
of refining. The following are the most important for present purposes: 

1. Viscosity Index (V.I.') (32). This is a measure of the change of viscosity 
with temperature. An oil of Pennsylvania origin (oil L) with a small 
viscosity-temperature coefficient was assigned a V.I. of 100, and one of 
Coastal origin (oil H) of large coefficient was assigned a value of 0. General 
relationships between the viscosities (Saybolt Universal) at 210 and 100F. 
were determined for many fractions of each oil. To determine the V.I. of 
an unknown oil (oil x), its viscosity at 100 and 210F. is determined and the 
following equation is used: 

V.I. = ML ~ Mg (100) (11.14) 

ML ~ M// 

where ML == viscosity at 100F. of the oil L fraction whose viscosity at 
210F. is the same as that of oil x 

HH = viscosity at 100F. of the oil H fraction whose viscosity at 
210F. is the same as that of oil x 

\L X viscosity of oil x at 100F. 

All the above viscosities are to be expressed as Saybolt Universal seconds. 
The relationship was originally developed for viscosities at 210F. between 
45 and 160 Saybolt Universal sec. but has since been extended to include a 
wider range. V.I. is unfortunately not an additive property for mixtures. 
For lubricants required to work over a wide temperature range, high V.I 
is desirable. 

2. Viscosity-Gravity Constant (V.G.C.) (74). The specific gravity of 
predominantly paraffinic oils is low, while that of aromatics is high, for a 



362

given viscosity, and the V.G.C. which characterizes these properties for 
mixtures is computed from the relationship: 

VQC 10G- 1.07521og(Mioo-38) 
" 10 log (/*ioo 38) 

G - 0.24 - 0.0222 log Qi 2 io - 35.5) /* t 1 K \

where G = sp. gr. at 60F. 

Mioo = viscosity (Saybolt Universal) at 100F. 

M2io = viscosity (Saybolt Universal) at 210F. 

The V.G.C. ranges from about 0.8 for highly paraffinic oils to about 0.95 for 
highly aromatic. Although originally developed for classifying crude oils, 
it is also used for refined products. It is an additive property for mixtures 
but shows no direct or simple relationship to V.I.

3. Aniline point is the temperature at which complete miscibility occurs 
for a mixture of the oil and aniline containing 50 per cent by volume of each. 
It is nearly the critical solution temperature (50) and is a measure of the 
aromaticity of the oil. 

Other indices such as carbon residue, color, oxidation stability, and pour 
and cloud points are described by Nelson (128). 

The various compounds in the oil distribute between raffinate and extract

phases depending upon their degree of paraffinicity, naphthenicity, or 
aromaticity. V.G.C., since it is an additive property, has been used most 
often for extraction calculations (37e, g). Triangular coordinates are 
plotted as in Fig. 11.9, with the V.G.C. of the solvent-free oil substituting 
for per cent aromatics, from data obtained by making single-stage extrac- 
tions. Solvent is plotted as volume per cent. Rectangular plotting has 
also been used, with per cent solvent and V.G.C. as coordinates (98) or, in 
the manner of Janecke (see Chap. 6), with solvent/oil ratio and specific 
volume of the solvent-free oil (135). 

Countercurrent Extraction. Skogan and Rogers (147) carried out several 
series of countercurrent extractions using the oil and solvent of Fig. 11.9, 
and have reported the V.G.C. 's of 
the solvent-free products for three- 
and five-stage extractions at several 
solvent/oil ratios. In Fig. 11.10 there 
are plotted the number of stages 
required to produce their products 
as calculated by the methods of 
Chap. 6, and it is seen that too few 
stages are obtained by calculation. 
Ordinarily it would be assumed that 
in the experiments equilibrium had 
not been obtained and that the stage 
efficiency was" low. Examination of 
their experimental procedure indi- 
cates that such low stage efficiencies would be highly unlikely, and indeed 
the same phenomena have been observed with other oil-solvent systems 
(82, 141, 147). The difficulty can be laid to the fact that the system is 
not composed of simply three components, and the distribution of a par- 
ticular component will depend upon the amount and kind of others that 
are in the extract (90). The equilibria therefore change with the extent 
of extraction, and data based on single-stage batches cannot directly be 
applied to multistage extraction. 

Skogan and Rogers (146, 147) have found, in the case of the few data 
which can be tested, that the operating point for stage construction on the 
diagram can be relocated, as in Fig. 11.11, to give calculated results which 
Coincide with the observed extractions. Point is determined from the 
specifications for feed F, solvent S, and products R and E in the manner 
described in Chap. 6 for true three-component systems. The operating 
point 0', from which stage-lines are then constructed, is located so that 00' 
is perpendicular to RO. The actual position must be determined for a 
given number of stages from actual experimental data, but the quantity 
[(ED/60') + FE] apparently remains constant for a fixed number of

stages irrespective of solvent ratio. Too few data are available to test this 
empirical correction fully. 

A different approach to this problem has been considered by Kalichevsky 
(91, 92) and Reeves (136), who find that the following empirical equations 




S

describe the amount of oil extracted and the amount of solvent entering 
the raffinate quite exactly for single solvent processes: 

log E' = (a + 6T) log S + c + dT (11.16) 

log SR = (e + fT) log R' + g + hT (11.17) 
for a fixed number of stages^ and 

log E' = ( j + k log T) log n + I + m log T (11.18) 

for a fixed solvent/feed ratio 

where E' = fraction of feed oil entering the extract 

T = temp. 

S = vol. of solvent per unit vol. of feed oil 
SR = fraction of solvent entering the raffinate 

R' vol. of oil per unit vol. of solvent in the raffinate 

n = no. of stages 
o, 6, . . . m = const. 

The empirical constants must be determined by an appropriate number of 
laboratory experiments, and additional equations have been developed for 
mixed- and double-solvent processes. These equations may be manipu- 
lated to determine effects of solvent quantity, stages, and temperature on 
the yield of raffinate and extract but do not indicate the quality of the 
products which also depends upon these variables. In addition, Berg, et al. 
(14) have extended the "overlap coefficient " concept devised for multi-

component distillation (115) to oil extractions in such a manner as to per- 
mit correlation of raffinate yield and quality (V.I.) for a given oil and 
solvent. 

Yield. To a large extent, the properties of a raffinate of fixed V.I. ex- 
tracted from a given oil are essentially the same irrespective of the extrac- 
tion processes (number of stages, solvent/oil ratio, solvent) used to obtain 
it (370). For example, the oil for which equilibrium data are given in Fig. 
11.9 gave raffinate products whose gravity and viscosity are shown as a

function of V.I. in Figs. 11.12 and 11.13. Various solvent/oil ratios, 
numbers of stages, and two different solvents were used; yet it is seen that 
there is relatively little segregation of the data. On the other hand, such 
qualities as carbon residue or color, for which the various solvents have 
diverse selectivities, may on occasion vary considerably from one product 
to another despite constancy of V.I. (90). The yield of raffinate of given 
quality (V.I.), on the other hand, varies appreciably with processing con- 
ditions. Figure 11.14 shows the yields for the oil of the previous figures, 
and the differences for single-stage operations for the different solvents are 
clear. For the furfural, multistage operation gives an improvement in 
yield, and the same could be expected for the Chlorex. Indeed, for multi- 
stage operation involving a considerable number of stages all solvents can 
be expected to give the same yield of a given quality raffinate. Additional 
data of this sort are presented by Kalichevsky (90). The choice of solvent 
then revolves about considerations of solvent quantity, cost, and other 
factors as discussed in Chap. 4. In any case, the quantity of solvent used 



366

to produce a given quality raffinate will be much reduced by multistage 
countercurrent operation, as for the simpler case of three-component 
systems.

Reflux. It is frequently the practice to operate extraction processes 
with reflux to improve the quality and yield of the product. As with three- 
component systems, this is most effective in the case of solvents of poorer 
selectivity, and the principles established in Chap. 6 can be used as a guide 
for such operation. Reflux is often provided by maintaining a temperature 
gradient throughout the extraction towers, with lowest temperatures at the 
extract end in the case of extractive solvents. This precipitates oil from 
the solvent-rich solutions by reducing solvent-oil solubilities, and the pre- 
cipitated oil then enters the raffinate phase. As with three-component 
systems, more effective fractionation is obtained if the reflux is provided 
throughout the entire extraction. 

Relation to Other Processes. The relative sequence of extraction and 
other refinery operations is largely a matter of choice to be made on the 
basis of economic considerations, since usually the same ultimate product 
can be recovered by several methods. In the case of distillates which con- 
tain paraffin wax, dewaxing may be done before or after the solvent refining 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES

(376). Paraffin wax concentrates in the raffinate during extraction, and 
consequently the pour point of the refined oil will be higher than that of 
the feedstock. If dewaxing is carried out first, the pour point of the feed- 
stock to the extraction process must be lower than that desired in the fin- 
ished product, and the wax is more difficult to finish. If dewaxing follows

extraction, any oil lost with the wax is the more valuable refined oil, and 
extraction may be hindered by precipitation of solid wax at refining temper- 
atures. The refiner must also decide where to choose between distillation 
of the crude to produce lighter lubricant and deasphalting the heavier 
products. Frequently the sequence of operations can be chosen so that the 
same solvents can be used in connection with several. Thus, propane is 
useful in both deasphalting and dewaxing. The mixed solvent, sulfur 
dioxide-benzene, is useful for refining and dewaxing. The Duo-Sol process 
both refines and deasphalts. In any case, the solvent-refined, dewaxed, 
deasphalted lubricant is usually finished by percolation through activated 
clay, occasionally by light sulfuric acid treatment as well. 

Solvents. The number of solvents that have been investigated and 
patented for lubricating-oil refining must number in the thousands. See 
Kalichevsky's review (90), for example. For a variety of reasons including 
cost and toxicity, those which are presently used industrially are limited to 
the following: 

1. Single-solvent Processes. Extraction solvents: j3,/3'-dichloroethyl ether 
(Chlorex), furfural, nitrobenzene, phenol. Precipitative solvent: propane. 

2. Mixed-solvent Processes: Benzene + sulfur dioxide (extractive mixture). 

3. Double-solvent Processes: Propane-cresylic acid + phenol (Duo-SoD 
(extractive and precipitative refining).

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



With the exception that the process of the third category is a fractional 
extraction, they are all basically the same. They differ only in details of 
processing temperatures, solvent/oil ratio, use of reflux and methods of ob- 
taining it, and solvent recovery. Indeed, the majority of the equipment 
is devoted to the solvent-recovery problems. 

Chlorex Process (9, 13, 37a, 70, 133). Chlorex (ft/3'-dichloroethyl 
ether) is especially suited for refining Pennsylvania oils since oil solubility 
in the solvent is fairly high, although it is used successfully on Mid-Conti- 
nent residua provided that these have been deasphalted prior to solvent 
treatment. Relatively low temperatures (&lt; 100F.) are customarily used 
which may then require that dewaxing be carried out prior to refining, al- 
though in at least one instance refining is done in the presence of wax in

stagewise equipment (90). Solvent/oil ratios as low as 0.75 to 1.5 are 
sufficient. Stagewise contact utilizing five to eight stages has been used, 
or towers packed with 1-in. Raschig rings as in the simplified flowsheet of 
Fig. 11.15. The solvent, which boils at 352F. at atmospheric pressure, is 
readily vacuum-stripped from the extract and raffinate with steam, and the 
condensed vapors from the strippers form two liquid layers of saturated 
Chlorex-water solutions. The aqueous layer (1.01 per cent solvent at 
68F.) is stripped of its Chlorex, while the Chlorex layer (= 3 per cent 
water) is reused without drying. Some hydrolysis releases HC1, which 
should be neutralized with NHs to prevent corrosion. 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 369 

In 1949, six plants using this process were treating 5,700 bbl./day, but 
no new plants have been installed since 1935. 

Furfural Process (23, 37/, 41, 94, 103). Furfural as a selective solvent 
is used at relatively high temperatures, usually in the range from 150 to 
250F. The higher permissible temperatures allow for extraction of oils 
of high viscosity and waxy fractions even in packed towers without danger 
of clogging the packing. 

In modern plants, the extraction is carried out in towers packed with 
approximately 20 ft. of 1-in. Raschig rings with provision for redistribution 
of the liquids, as in the flowsheet of Fig. 11.16. The solvent is the more 
dense and is introduced at the top, where the temperature is the highest 
in the extractor (= 200F.). The feedstock is introduced in the central 
portion of the tower; extract is withdrawn at the bottom, raffinate at the 
top. Extract reflux, consisting of a portion of the extract stream from 
which most of the solvent has been removed, is returned at the bottom of 
the extractor. Additional internal extract reflux is induced by cooling the 
withdrawn oil layer at intervals, which decreases the solvent-oil solubility 
and increases the raffinate/extract ratio when the cooled mixture is returned 
to the tower. A temperature gradient of 20 to 50F. is customarily main- 
tained over the length of the tower. 

The raffinate layer, containing roughly 10 per cent solvent, is heated in a 
direct-fired heater, stripped of its solvent in the presence of steam at atmos- 
pheric pressure, and sent to storage. The extract layer, containing in the 
neighborhood of 90 to 95 per cent solvent, is similarly heated, flash-evapo- 
rated at about 30 Ib./sq. in. and again at atmospheric pressure, and split 
to provide extract reflux for the extractor. The remainder of the extract 
stream is steam-stripped at atmospheric pressure and sent to storage. The 
wet furfural vapor from the steam strippers is condensed, whereupon two 
liquid layers form. The water-rich layer is steam-stripped of its furfural, 
and the water is discarded. The wet furfural-rich layer is distilled, together 
with the vapors from the extract evaporator, to give dry furfural as bottoms 
which is reused for extraction, and the water-furfural azeotrope as distillate 
which is recycled. 

By 1949, over 20 installations of this process were treating approximately 
60,000 bbl./day of feedstock. A recent installation, the largest of its kind, 
includes deaeration of the feed and vacuum -I ripping of the raffinate and 
extract products, with flue-gas blanketing of the solvent storage tanks to 
minimize deterioration of the furfural (101). 

Nitrobenzene Process (37c, 45, 46, 127). Nitrobenzene is both highly 
selective and fairly soluble with lubricating-oil fractions, and consequently 
is used at relatively low temperatures (50F.) and in small amounts (50 to 
200 per cent of the feed). The presence of precipitated paraffin wax does

LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 



371 



not interfere with the extraction, except that stagewise contacting is neces- 
sary. Five countercurrent stages are sufficient. The nitrobenzene is 
evaporated from the extract and raffinate solutions at 30 and 10 mm. Hg, 
325F., and vacuum steam-stripped at 65 mm. Hg. The wet nitrobenzene 
vapors are condensed, decanted, and distilled as in the case of furfural. 

One plant has been constructed, which treats 2,350 bbl./day of feedstock. 
The poisonous nature of the solvent and the low temperature of operation 
have probably contributed largely to the lack of adoption of this solvent. 
Simultaneous extraction with nitrobenzene and sulfuric acid has been tried 
commercially but is apparent^ not successful.

Phenol Process (4, 37&amp;, 154, 155, 156). Phenol is used at a sufficiently 
high temperature (= 200F.) to permit treatment of oils of high viscosity 
and wax content. Early installations used separate stage contactors, but 
modern plants have packed or perforated-plate countercurrent towers. 
The solvent is used either substantially dry or with water injection into the 
extract end of the extractor to reduce oil solubility and induce extract reflux. 
The latter is used in the ne\\er plants, according to the flowsheet of Fig. 
11.17. 

The feed is heated, absorbs phenol from stripping steam in the phenol 
absorber, and'enters the extractor. Dry phenol enters at the top, and water 
containing 11 per cent phenol is introduced near the base, thus reducing the 
temperature and oil solubility to induce extract reflux. Raffinate contain- 
ing about 20 per cent solvent is stripped of its phenol by flash vaporization

and steam stripping, and is sent to storage. Extract, which contains water 
and phenol to the extent of about 85 per cent, is dried by distillation of the 
phenol-water azeotrope, heated, stripped of its remaining phenol, and sent 
to storage. Dry phenol for the extractor is collected from the raffinate 
evaporator and extract stripper, while phenolic water from the drier is 
recirculated to the extractor for reflux. Phenol circulation amounts to 1 to

2.5 times the volume of oil, depending upon the source of the crude. Al- 
though the melting point of pure phenol is high (105.6F.), the presence of 
water and even small traces of extracted material reduces the melting point 
sufficiently to cause no problem with clogging of equipment. 

In 1950, 19 plants (world-wide) were treating 73,800 bbl./day of oil by 
this process. The largest plant treats 7,500 bbl./day. 

Propane Deasphalting (90, 135, 169). Propane is a most useful solvent 
for various refinery operations, since it is so readily and cheaply available 
at all refineries and because of its unusual solvent properties. If the com- 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES

ponents of a typical residual oil can be generalized to include only asphalt 
and nonasphaltic oil, Fig. 11.18 explains the behavior encountered in typical 
propane treating (169). Propane exhibits lower critical solution tempera- 
tures with both asphalt and nonasphaltic oil. Actual phase diagrams and 
temperatures naturally depend upon the nature of the oil, but in the figure, 
t\ can be taken as approximately 100F. (somewhat above the critical solu- 
tion temperature with asphalt), k as 140F., and U as 180F. (above the 
critical solution temperature with nonasphaltic oil). At temperatures near 
3 , it should be possible to deasphalt the oil to any extent desired. 

Modern deasphalting operates at temperatures somewhat below 250F., 
with countercurrent extraction as in Fig. 11.19. Propane/oil ratios as high

as 9 are sometimes used since, as indicated in Fig. 11.18, the oil is more 
thoroughly extracted from the asphalt the larger the solvent ratio. The 
high vapor pressure of propane permits its easy removal from both extract 
and raffinate. Alternatively, the raffinate solution can be cooled by pro- 
pane evaporation and be dewaxed before complete propane removal is 
carried out. 

Sulfur Dioxide-Benzene Process (16, 28, 33, 40, 54, 87). Sulfur dioxide 
alone is too highly selective for aromatic hydrocarbons to produce a raffi- 
nate of high V.I. from lubricating-oil fractions, since it rejects naphthenic 
compounds almost entirely. With a mixed solvent containing both sulfur 
dioxide and benzene, raffinate yield decreases and V.I. increases as percent- 
age of benzene and solvent/oil ratio increase. The quantity of benzene 
used varies with the feedstock but may be in the neighborhood of 15 to 25 



374 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

per cent. The flowsheet resembles that for treating light distillates with 
sulfur dioxide alone with the exception that the two solvents are separated 
from the oil separately, and consequently a more elaborate solvent-recovery 
scheme is required. Separate recovery permits ready adjustment of ben- 
zene concentrations, however. The process has not been widely adopted, 
and, in 1947, world-wide installations sufficient to refine 10,300 bbl./day 
of oil were in operation (151). 

Duo-Sol Process (1, 116, 117, 163, 164). This is the only commercially 
established lubricating-oil process which utilizes fractional extraction 
(double-solvent) methods. The insoluble liquids are propane as the paraf- 
finic-naphthenic solvent and a mixture of 40 per cent phenol and 60 per 
cent crcsylic acid ("Selecto") as the aromatic-asphalt solvent. Cresylic 
acid has been proposed as a single solvent for lubricant refining with charac- 
teristics somewhat similar to nitrobenzene but has not been exploited 
industrially. The use of propane permits the double-solvent process to 
deasphalt and refine simultaneously, and consequently Mid-Continent 
residua are fairly readily handled without prior treatment. At the cus- 
tomary temperature of operation (== 100F.), paraffin waxes are soluble in 
the propane and do not interfere. The process enjoys the advantage of 
being able to vary the ratio of the two solvents to oil separately in establish- 
ing the best operating conditions. Generally, increased Selecto/propane 
ratio results in high V.I., low carbon residue, low viscosity, and low yield of 
raffinate. Increased quantities of propane improve the raffinate color. 
While actual ratios vary considerably with different conditions of operation, 
a typical installation (1) uses propane/Selecto/oil = 5.8:3.7:1.0. 

A typical flowsheet is indicated in Fig. 11.20. Countercurrent stage- 
wise extraction with seven stages is customary, and it is found that, except 
for the initial introduction* of the feed, causing the extract and raffinate 
streams to flow simultaneously through 10 or 15 ft. of piping at velocities of 
10 to 16 ft./sec. provides adequate mixing. The feed is mixed with the 
countercurrently flowing streams by means of the device shown in Fig. 9.9. 
Settlers of the design shown in Fig. 9.18 are used. The propane-rich 
raffinate phase is stripped of propane and Selecto in that order and sent to 
storage, and the Selecto-rich extract is treated similarly. Propane is com- 
pressed and condensed for reuse. The Selecto vapor, which contains both 
propane and stripping steam, is condensed, stripped of its water and pro- 
pane, and the Selecto sent to storage for reuse. The water, containing 
some dissolved Selecto, is sent to the propane storage tank where propane 
extracts most of the Selecto, and the remaining water is reused for stripping 
steam. 

In 1950, 18 Duo-Sol plants (world-wide) were treating 65,000 bbl./day 
of oil (117), and detailed descriptions of very large recent installations are 
available (1, 101).

376 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

FAT, OIL, AND RELATED PROCESSES 

Fats and oils, substances of animal and plant origin, are principally tri- 
glyceryl esters of the fatty acids, or triglycerides, of general formulas 
H 2 C(OOR / ) HC(OOR") H 2 C(OOR'"). R', R", and R"' represent 
long, even-numbered, carbon-chain radicals, saturated and unsaturated, 
mostly of 8 to 22 carbon atoms each, all of which may be different for a 
given glyceride molecule. Any one fat or oil will contain many fatty acids, 
and these with some exceptions are relatively evenly distributed among the 
glyceride molecules, especially in the case of the vegetable seed oils. The 
various fats and oils then differ largely in the type, number, and distribu- 
tion of the various fatty acids contained in the glycerides. In addition, at 
least in the unrefined products, there are small percentages of free fatty 
acids formed by partial hydrolysis of the triglycerides, phosphatides (tri- 
glycerides with one fatty acid replaced by a phosphoric acid ester, such as 
lecithin and cephalin), sterols, vitamins, carbohydrates, carotenoid pig- 
ments, proteins, tocopherols, and other substances of unknown structure 
(10). After various treatments and processes, the fats and oils enter into 
a wide variety of products such as foods, paints, soap, printing inks, fatty- 
acid derivatives, lubricants, cosmetics, and medicinal products. Extrac- 
tion processes of interest here have been developed in connection with the 
separation of the constituents of the oils, the fatty acids or related sub- 
stances, and in the hydrolysis of the oils. 

Propane Refining. The equilibrium relationships existing between a 
large number of high-molecular-weight compounds related to the fat and 
oil industries in binary mixture with liquid propane have been studied in 
detail by Hixson, ct al. (17, 35, 75, 76). Many of these compounds, as in the 
case of petroleum oils, show lower critical solution temperatures and solu- 
bility curves of the type of Fig. 2.2, where the decreased solubility at higher 
temperatures is attributed to the decreased density of the propane as its 
vapor-liquid critical point is approached. In the case of the esters and 
long-chain fatty acids, a correlation between the lower critical solution 
temperature and effective molecular weight has been developed as presented 
in Fig. 11.21 (17). In this correlation, the ordinary formula weights of the 
esters are used, but twice the ordinary values are required for the fatty 
acids in accordance with the proposal that the acids are associated as dimers 
in the hydrocarbon solution. It can be predicted from the correlation that 
esters and acids of effective molecular weight below about 460 will not 
exhibit a lower critical solution temperature with propane since the curve 
indicates that such temperatures should be above 214F. The critical 
temperature (vapor-liquid) of propane is 212.2F., that of the propane 
solutions will be only a few degrees at the most above this, and at higher 
temperatures the propane is no longer in the liquid state. This has been 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES

confirmed in observations with ethyl stearate (mol. wt. = 312.5), lauric 
acid (effective mol. wt. = 400.6), and myristic acid (effective mol. wt. = 
456.7); in the case of the last, the vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid critical 
temperatures seemed almost to coincide (17). Measurements have also 
been made with other types of compounds and with other hydrocarbons. 
Ternary liquid equilibria of systems including acids and esters with pro- 
pane have also been studied (35, 75, 76), and phase diagrams of the type of 
Fig. 2.14 result. The data indicate that for any fatty acid-ester combina- 
tion, a difference in the binary critical solution temperature with propane 
of less than 9.9F. does not lead to selectivities sufficiently great to permit

separation by extraction with propane, whereas differences of the order of 
45F. permit ready separation (see Chap. 3). In the case of a refined 
cottonseed oil, for example, a critical solution temperature with propane of 
151. 2F. was found (75), and an excellent separation is possible between the 
glyceride and free oleic acid, as indicated in Fig. 4.5. Mixtures of stearic 
and palmitic acids, or of stearic and oleic acids, on the other hand, cannot 
be separated. Separation of compounds of different chemical type is 
possible despite relatively small differences in molecular weight. Thus, 
abietic acid (mol. wt. = 322) and oleic acid (mol. wt. = 282) are readily 
separated with propane (76). 
The industrial refining of fats and oils with propane is known as the 



378 



LIQUID EXTRACTION 



Solexol process (3, 77, 134). The critical solution temperatures with pro- 
pane of the various constituents of the oils and their solubilities at higher 
temperatures are sufficiently different to permit their separation in part. 
By increasing the temperature of a propane-oil solution in step wise fashion, 
the solubilities of the various oil constituents in groups are exceeded one by 
one, and they can be removed in the order of their molecular complexity or 
molecular weight. Thus, for example, a scheme for fractionating a sardine 
oil is outlined in Fig. 11.22 (134) , whereby the oil is decolorized and 
separated into fractions of different degrees of unsaturation and a vitamin

concentrate by maintenance of a suitable temperature gradient from one 
tower to the next. In similar fashion, crude soybean oil can either be 
merely decolorized and separated from its free fatty acids, or separated as 
well into a high iodine-number fraction and an edible fraction. Linseed 
oil, tallow, and other similar products can be similarly decolorized and 
fractionated. Conventional refining of products such as these involves 
such operations as caustic treatment and bleaching by adsorption or chem- 
ical means (10), but a better quality of final product at better yield is 
obtained by solvent refining, and the solvent process is clearly more 
versatile. In a manner similar to the propane dewaxing of deasphalted 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 379 

lubricating oils, high melting-point constituents of the fats such as stearin 
can be crystallized from the extracted product by evaporation of the pro- 
pane to produce chilling (134). 

A description of a recent large installation provides typical details of the 
process (121) . In a plant for the decolorization of 200,000 Ib. of tallow/day, 
the extraction tower is 39.5 ft. high, 5.5 ft. in diameter, and contains 16 
baffles. In a typical operation, crude tallow is preheated to 159F. and 
enters the tower at approximately the midpoint, while liquid propane at 
158F. enters at the bottom in a 10-17:1 ratio to the tallow. Above the 
tallow inlet, three groups of steam coils adjust the temperature and con- 
sequently regulate the amount of reflux which flows down the tower, and 
the temperature at the top is kept at 162F. with close temperature control. 
The pressure is kept at 465 Ib./sq. in., roughly 85 Ib./sq. in. greater than 
that required for complete liquefaction of the propane. The bottom extract 
product contains color bodies, dirt, and some glycerides in a 50 per cent 
solution with propane. The raffinate contains 98 per cent of the crude 
tallow in refined form. Both products are freed of propane by flash evapo- 
ration and steam stripping, and the propane is returned to the process. 
The temperature and solvent-to-fat ratio can of course be varied to suit 
the feed material and the product desired. Higher temperatures at the top 
of the tower, for example, increase the extract yield and improve the raffi- 
nate color. 

Furfural Refining. The separation of the saturated from the unsat- 
urated glycerides of vegetable oils has become increasingly desirable in 
recent years, as the paint and varnish industries have encountered inter- 
ruptions of the flow of drying oils from foreign supply sources. If the 
unsaturated portions of oils such as corn oil (iodine numberf = 125), 
cottonseed oil (iodine number = 106), or soybean oil (iodine number = 130) 
could be separated, these could augment the supplies of drying oils for paint 
manufacture considerably. In like fashion, exceptionally effective drying 
fractions could be separated from drying oils such as linseed oil (iodine 
number = 175). Unfortunately, the glycerides of such oils are mixed, so 
that it is impossible by direct extraction to make a complete separation of 
the saturated and unsaturated esters, regardless of the selectivity of the 
solvent used. For example, although some 14 per cent of the soybean oil 
fatty acids are saturated, there are apparently no completely saturated 
glycerides in the oil (96). A large number of solvents have been investi- 
gated (51, 142, 153), and in general polar solvents such as the nitroparaffins, 
sulfur dioxide, the sulfolanes, and furfural are most effective. Of these, 
only furfural has been used industrially. 

Furfural selectively extracts the more unsaturated glycerides from the 

t Iodine number = the number of grams of iodine absorbed per 100 gm. of oil; it is 
a measure of the degree of unsaturation. 



380 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

oils, as well as the free fatty acids and the more complex substances such as 
phosphatides and tocopherols. Equilibria for the glycerides can be ex- 
pressed in terms of iodine number and can be treated graphically on tri- 
angular coordinates as in Fig. 2.34 or on Janecke coordinates (142). Pre- 
sumably the same difficulties in translating equilibrium data obtained from 
single-stage batchwise experiments to multistage countercurrent extrac- 
tions should arise for such complex mixtures as do for petroleum products, 
but too few data are available to evaluate this. 

In the refining of soybean oil, either of two procedures may be used, 
depending upon whether the feed is a crude oil or has been alkali-refined 
prior to extraction (58). For refined oil, the oil feed is introduced into 
approximately the center of a packed tower, and furfural at a ratio of 
8-14: 1 of oil is introduced at the top. The raffinate leaving the top of the 
tower then consists of approximately 30 to 40 per cent of the feed oil 
(solvent-free basis) with an iodine number in the range 95 to 110. At the 
lower end of the tower, extract reflux may be returned at the rate of 110 to 
120 per cent of the feed-oil rate, and the withdrawn extract product may 
consist of 60 to 70 per cent of the feed oil (solvent-free basis) of iodine 
number in the range 152 to 154. For unrefined oil, the furfural extract 
contains the free fatty acids, unsaponifiable matter, and antioxidants from 
both oil and furfural which delay the drying of the oil when it is used in 
paints (142). Consequently a scheme such as that indicated in Fig. 11.23 
is used (58, 142). Here the furfural extract is contacted with a petroleum 
naphtha in a second extractor, which removes the desirable glycerides from 
the furfural solution but leaves behind the free fatty acids, antioxidants, 
and other undesirable portions. A small amount of naphtha is used with 
the extract reflux in the first column. The raffinate from such a fractiona- 
tion is suitable for the preparation of hydrogenated fats, the extract is of 
varnish-grade quality, and the by-product fraction is a source of sterols, 
tocopherols, and free fatty acids. Linseed oil may be similarly fractionated 
for a high iodine-number fraction and marine oils for vitamin fractions (58). 
Furfural may also be used to separate the free fatty acids from each other, 
although since they are completely soluble in furfural, they must be 
selectively extracted from a naphtha solution. 

A commercial plant for these processes follows the general scheme of 
Fig. 11.23 (95). For 200,000 Ib./day of degummed soybean oil and a 
solvent ratio of 8.3:1, two extraction columns each 5.5 ft. in diameter, 
87 ft. tall (75 ft. of packing), operate in parallel for the furfural extraction 
at 120F. The interface is held between the oil and solvent inlets, so that 
both phases are dispersed in one section of the tower or the other. The 
naphtha extraction is carried out in a single packed tower 4.5 ft. in diameter, 
containing a 50-ft. depth of J^-in. Raschig rings, at 70F. Furfural and 
naphtha are removed from the products by a series of multiple-effect

vacuum evaporators and strippers. Many details are provided by Kenyon, 
et al. (95). 

For more complete separation of the saturated and unsaturated constitu- 
ents of the oils than the direct extraction processes are capable of, it would 
seem necessary first to hydrolyze, or "split/' the oil and fractionate the 
resulting fatty acids. The free acids can be separated with furfural if they 
are first dissolved in naphtha (12, 52, 85) or with propane (77). Alterna- 
tively, the glycerides may be converted by alcoholysis to monoesters, such

Fat Splitting. Fat splitting is the hydrolysis of a fat or oil with water to 
produce glycerol and fatty acids. The fatty acids may then be either 
neutralized with caustic to produce soap or otherwise processed. While 
the splitting process is concerned only partly with extraction, the equipment 
and procedures follow typical extraction techniques. The mechanism of 
the reaction has been fairly well worked out (100, 119). Initially, while 
water is in contact with unsplit oil, the two are fairly insoluble and reaction 



382 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

is heterogeneous and slow. As fatty acids are released, the solubility of 
water in the acid-oil solution increases, the reaction becomes largely homo- 
geneous in the oil-phase and proceeds much more rapidly, increasingly so at 
higher temperatures. As glycerol is released it is extracted into the aqueous 
phase, and a reaction equilibrium is established which is independent of 
temperature, thus indicating the absence of any heat of reaction. The 
ultimate percentage of split of the oil in a batch process is then dependent 
upon the relative proportions of oil and water used and will be greater with 
increased amounts of water since the glycerol concentration is thereby 
reduced. Evidently the fatty acids are hydrolyzed from the triglycerides 
in stepwise fashion, so that the partially split fat contains a high proportion 
of mono- and diglycerides. 

Catalysts such as zinc oxide or Twitchell reagent (alkylaryl sulf onic acids) 
may be used which increase the rate of reaction but not the extent of hy- 
drolysis. Operations may be carried out batchwise at atmospheric pressure 
and 212F. with the Twitchell catalyst, or in autoclaves at high pressures 
up to 450F. with or without catalyst. Complete miscibility with water 
may occur at temperatures about 550 to 650F., depending upon the fat. 
Continuous countercurrent contact of the water and oil at temperatures 
below complete miscibility increases the percentage splitting possible, to 
an extent depending merely upon the time of contacting. 

The countercurrent process is of particular interest here. The advan- 
tages of such operation have been recognized since at least 1860 (161), 
although it is only in recent years that commercial exploitation has been 
practiced under more modern patents (84, 118, 126, 171). In typical 
operations (2, 105, 106) the oil, deaerated to lessen darkening of the 
finished fatty acids, is introduced into the bottom of a 78-ft. unpacked 
tower operating at 700 to 800 Ib./sq. in. The oil-water interface is main- 
tained at about 10 ft. from the bottom of the tower, and in the zone below 
the interface the dispersed oil phase is heated and saturated with water by 
direct contact with the aqueous phase. Additional heat is supplied at the 
top of the exchanger section by direct injection of deaerated steam to bring 
the oil to the operating temperature, 450 to 550F. The 60-ft. height 
above the interface is the principal reaction-extraction zone, with the oil 
as the continuous phase having a hold-up of 2 to 3 hr. Injection of steam 
at intervals maintains the temperature at the desired value. 

Deaerated soft water enters at the top and flows through 8 ft. of trays 
of the type shown in Fig. 10.10, where direct contact with the rising fatty 
acids provides heat exchange for heating the water and cooling the acids. 
The water is then dispersed by means of a perforated plate provided with 
a riser for the fatty acids entering from below. Cooling of the fatty acids 
in this manner to temperatures in the neighborhood of 200F. precipitates 
practically all the dissolved water, and the acids are led to further process- 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 383 

ing. With a total water/oil ratio of 0.5-0.8 : 1, 97 to 99 per cent hydrolysis 
of the oil can be expected. From the bottom of the tower the glycerol 
solution (sweet water), which may contain 10 to 25 per cent glycerol, is led 
to storage. This solution requires only a small application of lime for 
coagulation of impurities before concentration. Allen, et al. (2) report data 
respecting rates of heat transfer and extent of hydrolysis for various operat- 
ing conditions. 

The fat-splitting tower is lined with a special alloy, type 316 stainless 
steel or Inconel, since the hot fatty acids are highly corrosive, and the 
equipment is expensive in first cost. The high percentage of hydrolysis 
without catalyst, the purity and light color of the acids, and the high con- 
centration of the sweet water nevertheless make the process attractive, and 
several installations have been made in the last several years. 

Several interesting processes for solvent extraction of the glycerol from 
the sweet waters produced by either the continuous or other hydrolysis 
operations have recently been proposed (42). 

Rosin and Tall Oil. Unrefined wood rosin, obtained by the steam dis- 
tillation or naphtha leaching of pine-tree stumps, differs from the gum 
rosin obtained from the living tree in that it is dark in color and discolors 
badly when incorporated into soaps, paper sizing, and other products. 
In both cases, the unrefined products contain some 80 to 90 per cent abietic 
acid and isomers, CigH^COOH, in addition to more highly aromatic and 
oxygenated resinous materials. Wood rosin may be refined by treatment 
with sulfuric acid, by adsorption of undesirable materials on fuller's earth, 
or by solvent refining. In solvent refining, the crude rosin is dissolved in a 
petroleum naphtha approximating gasoline to give about 15 per cent solu- 
tion, which is then contacted with furfural for the extraction of the objec- 
tionable substances (81, 88). Extraction is carried out countercurrently 
in a type of perforated-plate tower using a woven wire screen for the per- 
forated plates (102), and these are customarily some 40 ft. tall, 3 ft. in 
diameter, with 8-in. spacing between plates. The naphtha raffinate is 
evaporated and steam-stripped to yield a light-colored rosin which is an 
acceptable substitute for the more expensive gum rosin for practically all 
purposes. Various grades, defined in terms of color, can be made depend- 
ing upon the extent of extraction. The furfural extract, after removal of 
the solvent, has special uses in certain plastics, as an emulsifying agent, in 
core oils, and in other products. Alternatively, propane can be used as a 
solvent, in the manner of the Solexol process, for refining rosin (78), al- 
though apparently at this time there have been no industrial applications 
of this method. 

Tall oil is a mixture of some 38 to 58 per cent rosin acids (principally abi- 
etic), 54 to 36 per cent of unsaturated fatty acids of 18 carbon atoms/mole- 
cule, and some 5 to 10 per cent of more complex material such as the sterols. 



384 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

It is produced as a low-priced by-product of the sulfate process for paper- 
making. After refining by treatment with sulfuric acid or by vacuum dis- 
tillation, it enters into a large number of diversified industrial products. 
Its value would be increased considerably if the rosin acids could be 
separated from the fatty acids, and to this end much research has been and 
is presently being carried on. Although many patents have been issued, 
the most promising processes so far proposed have been propane refining 
of the tall oil directly (76, 77, 134) and furfural refining of methylated tall 
oil (53, 58), which separates the methyl esters of the fatty acids from the 
unesterified rosin acids. Neither of these have had commercial exploita- 
tion as yet. 

DEPHENOLIZATION OF GAS LIQUOR 

In the operation of by-product coke ovens, the gas evolved during coking 
is sprayed with water and cooled, thus depositing an aqueous solution, 
"gas liquor." The gas liquor contains in solution such materials as ammo- 
nium salts of a variety of ions (C0 3 ~, SCN~, and SC&gt;4 = , etc.), and organic 
compounds such as mono- and polyhydric phenols, pyridine bases, organic 
acids, and neutral oils (unsaturated hydrocarbons and other organic sub- 
stances). The actual composition varies widely, depending upon the coal 
used for coking and the details of the manufacturing procedure. In the 
past, the liquor was distilled for recovery of ammonia and the residue dis- 
carded to the sewer. The phenols particularly introduced into rivers in 
this way are very objectionable, since they are harmful to fish and affect 
the taste of the water when present in only the smallest amounts (0.1 
p.p.m.). Chlorination of the water to make it potable produces chloro- 
phenols whose taste is objectionable at 0.02-p.p.m. concentration. If 
unloaded upon sewage disposal plants, the residue may seriously over- 
burden such facilities. The phenols are therefore removed from the gas 
liquor prior to distillation by any of several processes, one of which involves 
extraction with light oil (essentially benzene) or other solvents. 

The various phenols in the untreated gas liquor may total anything from 
0.5 to 1.5 gm./l. for coke-oven operation to as high as 12 gm./l. for low- 
temperature carbonization, with phenol itself usually accounting for the 
majority of the total. Phenol has the poorest distribution coefficient 
(2 to 2.5 for light oil as solvent) and is the most difficult to extract. Re- 
moval of total phenols is usually carried out to the extent of 95 to 99 per 
cent for coke-oven gas liquors. 

A typical flowsheet is shown in Fig. 11.24 (86). In this installation, 
1,500 gal./hr. of gas liquor is washed countercurrently with 1,800 gal./hr. 
of light oil in two extractors each 6 ft. in diameter, 36 and 34 ft. tall, 
respectively, arranged for gravity flow of the gas liquor from one to the 
other. Each extractor contains three 36-in. beds of egg-sized coke sup-

ported on wire screens at suitable intervals. The dephenolized gas liquor 
contains dissolved light oil which, in American practice, is largely recovered 
since it is evolved upon subsequent distillation of the liquor. The vapors 
are then returned to the main gas stream which is subsequently scrubbed 
to recover the light oil. The light oil extracts phenols, cresols, and higher 
phenols as well as small amounts of pyridine, naphthalene, and other tar 
oils. It is washed with a sodium hydroxide solution to extract the phenols 
as sodium phenolates by dispersing the light oil into the caustic in two 5-ft. 
by 14-ft. towers. The caustic is not circulated, but after it accumulates

phenols, it is pumped batchwise to the neutralizing tank where it is steam- 
distilled to remove dissolved benzene and acidified with sulf uric acid to re- 
lease or " spring " the phenols. The latter are blown by air pressure to 
storage, and the sodium sulfate produced is discarded. The recovered light 
oil flows through a settling tank from which settled emulsions and sludge are 
periodically removed and returns to the extractors. It must be cleaned by 
distillation after 6 months' service. The recovered phenols can be worked 
up into USP grade phenol and highly refined cresol. 

While flowsheets are generally the same in principle in other plants, they 
frequently differ in details. For example, Crawford (30) describes a plant 
in which the extractors are spray towers, where the pyridine is continuously 
removed from a portion of the extracting solvent by an acid wash, and 
where C0 2 or NaHC0 3 is used instead of H 2 SO 4 to release the phenols from 



386 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

the caustic solution, the resulting Na 2 C03 being useful in removal of H 2 S 
from the gas. Hatch (69) describes extractors packed with a spiral arrange- 
ment of wooden grids. The caustic washing towers may be incorporated 
structurally in the same shell as the gas liquor extractors (170). Variants 
of these flowsheets are used extensively in Europe as well as in the United 
States (79, 97, 138, 167). 

Stagewise extraction is also practiced in this country, with 3-stage plants 
using centrifugal pumps for mixers and with the settlers arranged in a single 
tower, one above the other (59). Particular care must be taken against the 
formation of unsettleable emulsions in these plants. An extensive descrip- 
tion of a 10-stage Holley-Mott installation (Chap. 9) in Great Britain is 
available (125), where 1 stage is used for detarring of the gas liquor, 5 
stages for dephenolizing with light creosote oil, 1 stage for water-washing 
of the light oil extract to remove NH 3 and H^S, and 3 stages for caustic 
washing of the light oil to remove phenols. 

Tricresyl phosphate has been used in Germany as a dephenolization 
solvent (56, 162) and offers the advantages of very favorable distribution 
coefficients for phenols and lower solubility in the gas liquor. Phenols are 
recovered by vacuum distillation. The solvent is relatively expensive and 
deteriorates with use, however. Butyl acetate ("phenosalvan") has also 
been used abroad. Bristow (21) provides a most complete description of 
the auxiliary processes in a low-temperature carbonization plant, including 
dephenolization and other extraction processes such as removal of tar acids 
from light and middle oils and chemical treating of light oils. A very 
complete review is also provided by Wilson and Wells (170). 

RECOVERY OF PENICILLIN 

Penicillin, a minor product of the growth of the mold Penicillium notatum 
on suitable mediums, includes several acid substances which are antibiotic 
toward many disease-producing bacteria. Discovered in 1928 by Sir 
Alexander Fleming, it was not until 1939 that extensive studies regarding 
its qualities were undertaken; yet large-scale production methods were 
worked out sufficiently rapidly so that it was available in large quantities 
during the later half of the Second World War. 

The concentration of the active principle formed in the original fermenta- 
tion broth to the final packaged product presents many serious difficulties 
(137). The penicillins are biologically inactivated by acids and bases, 
moisture, heavy metal ions, oxidizing agents, high temperature, and certain 
bacterially produced enzymes such as penicillinase. In the broth before 
recovery, the potency may be reduced by as much as two-thirds in 24 hr. 
During certain concentration procedures, where it may be present in water 
solution at pH 2, 0C., its half-life may be as low as 2.5 hr. It is more 
stable in dry neutral solutions, but in any case processing must be carried 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 387 

out rapidly and under carefully controlled conditions throughout, both 
chemically and biologically. Concentration of the product is rapidly be- 
coming a simpler process because of the tremendous advances being made 
in growing more concentrated solutions during the fermentation. In 1941, 
a broth potency of 2 Oxford units (O.U.)f/cu. cm., or roughly 1.2 p.p.m., 
was produced, but this was increased to 50 O.U./cu. cm. in 1943 and to 
500 O.U./cu. cm. by 1949. The process flowsheets have been frequently 
altered to accommodate the improved raw materials. 

Until recently, the concentration procedure generally involved the follow- 
ing steps (110, 140, 150, 158, 172). After growth of the mold in a culture 
medium of corn-steep liquor, the broth was filtered free of mold and the 
penicillin concentrated by adsorption on activated carbon. The carbon 
was filtered and the penicillin eluted from the solid by an 80 per cent ace- 
tone solution in water. This in turn was concentrated either by vacuum 
evaporation of the acetone at 65F. or extraction of the acetone into a 
water-immiscible solvent. The aqueous penicillin was then chilled to 0C., 
acidified to pH 2 with phosphoric acid, and extracted into chloroform or 
amyl acetate. This solution in turn was extracted with a dilute solution 
of sodium bicarbonate to pH 7, to give an aqueous solution of the sodium 
salt of penicillin. The solution was filtered and packaged into small vials, 
the water removed by freezing and sublimation at very low pressure, and 
the vials sealed. The most crucial stage in this procedure is the acidifica- 
tion of the concentrated activated carbon eluate and extraction into the 
organic solvent: efficient extraction requires low pH, yet the half -life of 
the penicillin is thereby rapidly lowered. For this reason, line mixers of the 
type of Fig. 9.14 and centrifugal phase separators were early introduced for 
this step, since the time of contact and hold-up was thereby kept small. 
Podbielniak centrifugal extractors (Fig. 10.12) proved to be especially 
useful because of their exceedingly low hold-up. Ethyl acetate, ethyl 
ether, cyclohexanone, dioxane, ethylene dichloride, furfuryl acetate, and 
methyl isobutyl ketone are all efficient penicillin solvents, but chloroform 
and amyl acetate are more selective although they offer somewhat lower 
distribution coefficients. 

With the development in the fermentation broth of concentrations of the 
order of 500 O.U./cu. cm. total penicillin (80 per cent penicillin-G) , the 
concentration procedures have not required adsorption on activated carbon 
(158). A presently recommended flowsheet (89) involves continuous, 
countercurrent, multistage extraction of the filtered and acidified (pH 2 to 
2.15) broth with a one-fifth volume of amyl acetate in the centrifugal extrac- 
tor at room temperature; similar extraction into a ^ volume of cold buffer 
solution (pH 6.8 to 7.0); acidification to pH 2 and reextraction into a ^ 

t The four principal pure penicillins are rated at 1,550 (penicillin-F), 1,667 (-G), 900 
(-X), and 2,300 (-K) O.U./mg., respectively. 



388 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

volume of amyl acetate. This solution contains 60,000 O.U./cu. cm. and 
may be extracted into a neutral buffer solution to give a product of high 
purity with an over-all loss of penicillin broth to crystalline product not 
exceeding 20 per cent. It can be expected that further improvement in 
broth concentrations and commercial development of synthetic penicillin 
will in time change these procedures, too. 

Processes somewhat similar to these are probably also used in the con- 
centration of other more recently developed antibiotic substances, such as 
streptomycin, chloromycetin, bacitracin, and aureomycin, although the 
technical details of these processes have not been made available. 

MISCELLANEOUS ORGANIC PROCESSES 

There are so many organic chemical maimfitct uring processes using liquid 
extraction as a step in the procedure that no attempt will be made to 
describe or even list them all. They are all basically similar but differ in 
details, particularly with regard to the recovery of the solvent from the ex- 
tract and raffinate solutions. They may be carried out either in batchwise 
or continuous fashion depending on the size of the manufacturing process. 
The following list includes a representative portion of these, which will 
serve to indicate the wide applicability of the extraction technique. 

1. Acetic acid is extracted from the demethanolized pyroligneous liquors 
resulting from the destructive distillation of wood (20, 63, 130) and from 
solutions of the cellulose acetate industries (27), with ethyl ether, isopropyl 
ether, ethyl acetate, or a mixture of the last two as solvents, in continuous 
processes. 

2. In the manufacture of phenol by the vapor-phase regenerative process 
(Raschig process) involving the indirect oxidation of benzene to phenol 
with chlorobenzene as an intermediate, liquid extraction is used in the wash- 
ing of the crude chlorobenzene with caustic solution to remove HC1, and 
phenol is extracted from recovered HC1 solution and from the principal 
aqueous stream by benzene in large extractors packed with Raschig rings 
(113, 129). 

3. In the manufacture of phenol by the caustic hydrolysis of chloroben- 
zene in the liquid phase, the sodium phenolate solution is extracted continu- 
ously with chlorobenzene to remove diphenyl ether and phenyl xenyl ether 
prior to acidification to release the phenol. Alternatively, these can be 
allowed to build up in the mixture to an equilibrium concentration (64). 

4. In the manufacture of nitroglycerine, the nitrated material is extracted 
with water and dilute sodium carbonate solution to remove excess acid 
either batchwise, or in Europe continuously (144). 

5. In the manufacture of synthetic glycerol from propylene, the concen- 
trated aqueous glycerol is extracted with xylene or isooctane to remove 
objectionable coloring matter in a continuous process (43, 168). 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 389 

6. Aniline is recovered from dilute aqueous solution by batch extraction 
with nitrobenzene, in the manufacture of aniline from benzene (62). 

7. In the manufacture of DDT, the product is extracted from the acid- 
reaction mixture by hexane (62) or by chlorobenzene (25), and the extract 
washed with water and dilute aqueous sodium carbonate in continuous 
processing. 

8. Aluminum chloride catalyst is extracted from products of various 
Friedel-Krafts syntheses by water or caustic solution, as in the manufacture 
of ethylbenzene (120), and in the synthesis of phenylethyl alcohol or of 
chloracetophenone (62). 

9. Batch extractions are used in the many intricate processes of drug 
preparation either by synthesis or by concentration from natural products, 
such as 

a. The extraction by ethyl ether of Z-phenylacetylcarbinol produced by 
the yeast fermentation of benzaldehyde in the manufacture of ephedrine 
(73). 

b. The extraction of quinine by dilute acid from the naphtha solution 
obtained by leaching cinchona bark (44). 

c. The extraction of ergonovine from liquid ammonia by ethyl ether, and 
the repeated extraction of the alkaloid between ether and water (157). 

d. The extraction of ethyl malonate from the esterification mixture by 
benzene and the repeated washing of the benzene extract with caustic and 
water, in the manufacture of barbiturate drugs (139). 

10. Continuous and batch operations are used in the manufacture of 
various esters, such as 

o. The extraction of glycerol with water from the reaction mixture after 
the alcoholysis of glycerides (62). 

b. The extraction of ethanol from ethyl acetate, or of butanol from butyl 
acetate by water (11). 

11. Extraction is used in the manufacture of various emulsifying agents, 
for example, the extraction of unsulfated material with trichloroethylene 
in the sulfation of ricinoleic acid (15). 

12. The washing of various synthetic organic chemicals to free them of 
by-products are extraction processes, such as the washing of spent nitric 
acid from nitroparaffins with water, or the washing of sodium sulfite from 
crude /3-naphthol (62). 

Recovery of Organic Solvents. In connection with the recovery of 
volatile organic substances from aqueous solution, as in the separation of 
acetone or ethanol from aqueous solutions containing less than 5 per cent 
solute, Othmer, et al (131, 132) have shown that considerable savings can 
be expected in heat requirements if extraction by an appropriate high- 
boiling solvent followed by distillation of the extracted solute is used, as 
compared with direct rectification.

LIQUID EXTRACTION 



The simplified flowsheet of such an extraction and solvent-recovery plant 
for cases where the solvent is substantially immiscible is shown in Fig. 1 1 .25, 
on the assumption that the extracting solvent has the lower density. 
Raffinate, substantially exhausted of solute and saturated with solvent, 
leaves the bottom of the extractor and may be discarded if the solvent con- 
centration is very low. Ordinarily, however, it can be stripped of its solvent 
by a very simple distillation. Extract containing solvent and extracted 
solute, together with a small amount of water, is distilled, and provided

that the solute has the lowest boiling point in the system, it will distill over- 
head. The high-boiling solvent and water separate into two equilibrium 
liquid layers in the lower parts of the distillation column after removal of 
most of the solute, and these insoluble liquids can be withdrawn and de- 
canted. The solvent-rich layer is returned to the distillation column to be 
further exhausted of solute and is ultimately returned to the extractor for 
reuse. The water-rich layer, saturated with solvent and solute, is introduced 
into the extraction column at a point appropriate to its solute concentra- 
tion (see Chap. 6 for methods of designing extractors with multiple feed). 
Should the solvent show substantial miscibility with water (or have a 
lower selectivity in the extraction of the dissolved solute), the raffinate 
stripping must be carefully done, as in the raffinate stripper of Fig. 11.26. 
The solvent-water azeotrope leaves the top of the stripper and is distilled

along with the extract solution in the extract distillation column. For 
good heat economy, it is essential that the azeotrope composition be poor 
in water, else too much heat is required for vaporization of the water. 
The remainder of the flowsheet is essentially the same as that previously 
considered. The necessary coolers, pumps, etc., are not shown. 

Othmer and Ratcliffe (131) have presented experimental confirmation of 
these flowsheets and have obtained measurements of the heat requirements.

Heat economies by combined extraction-distillation processes, in compari- 
son to direct distillation, will result depending upon the respective vapor- 
liquid equilibria involved. Meissner, et al. (1 1 1, 1 12) in turn have proposed 
the dehydration of concentrated aqueous solutions of certain organic liquids 
by extraction of the water by means of strong solutions of '.' i ^.:i: : -- salts. 

INORGANIC EXTRACTION PROCESSES 

There have been relatively few applications of extraction in the inorganic 
chemical industries, but those that have been made are very effective. 
There should be ample opportunity for others. 



392 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

Purification of Sodium Hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide produced in the 
electrolytic diaphragm cell contains several impurities which make it unfit 
for direct use in the manufacture of rayon, certain cold-process soaps, and 
in other processes. Successful extraction of certain of these impurities 
with liquid ammonia is now used successfully on a large scale (164). Fifty 
per cent caustic solution containing 0.9 to 1.1 per cent NaCl and 0.05 to 
0.10 per cent NaClOs is customarily extracted to reduce the concentrations 
of these salts to 0.08 and 0.0002 per cent, respectively, in a continuous 
countercurrent operation. The ammonia used contains 70 to 95 per cent 
NH 3 , and its strength governs the extent of extraction. A yield of 95 
per cent of the feed caustic is obtained in the raffinate, the remainder 
leaving with the extract. Extract solution is distilled to recover anhydrous 
ammonia, and the ammonia in the raffinate is evaporated and recovered 
by absorption in water. The anhydrous and aqueous ammonia are then 
combined to give a solution of controlled strength which is then used in the 
extraction. Plants handling 150 tons/day of caustic are being operated. 

Metallurgical Applications. In the atomic-energy program initiated 
during the Second World War, it was necessary to obtain uranium metal 
for conversion to plutonium which contained concentrations of elements 
such as boron, cadmium, indium, and others, of less than 10~ 4 per cent (83). 
Uranium metal that had previously been available was not nearly so pure, 
especially that produced on a relatively large scale. It has been known for 
some time, however, that uranyl nitrate UC^NOs^ is quite soluble in ethyl 
ether, and the distribution characteristics of this salt between water and the 
ether are available (145). A metallurgical procedure involving leaching of 
the ore, precipitation of most of the undesirable metals, acidification with 
nitric acid to convert uranium to U02(NO 3 )2, and extraction with ethyl 
ether then gives a uranium which is purer than most of that available for 
laboratory purposes prior to the war. Although the details of the extrac- 
tion are not available, Smyth (152) indicates that, by 1942, 30 tons/month 
of uranium dioxide of extreme purity were made by this method, with 
increased production later in the atomic-energy program. 

Although it is not publicly known to what extent extraction operations 
have been applied in other parts of the atomic-energy program, there are 
many opportunities for application (83). For example, the metal slugs 
issuing from the piles contain plutonium, uranium, and a large number of 
other elements produced as fission by-products. The recovery of uranium 
from solutions of the slugs by ether extraction is a possibility, as is the simul- 
taneous extraction of plutonium and uranium for the purpose of separat- 
ing them from the fission by-products. The possibility of separating the 
various by-products by extraction is also good. The separation of thorium 
and uranium is necessary if thorium is to be irradiated to produce high 
concentrations of U 233 . Both thorium nitrate and uranyl nitrate can be 



LIQUID-EXTRACTION PROCESSES 393 

extracted from water solution by ether (145), and since their distribution 
coefficients are different they can be separated by this means. 

Other metal extractions have been made, but so far as is known, only on a 
laboratory scale. The extraction of ferric chloride from aqueous solution 
by isopropyl ether has been discussed previously (Figs. 10.24 and 10.33). 
In these studies (57), the distribution coefficient was found to be increased 
to as high as 6,000 in favor of the organic phase by addition of HC1 to the 
system. Such an extraction has been suggested as a means of separating 
iron from the nickel and chromium in stainless-steel scrap (108). Similarly, 
the separation of nickel and cobalt chlorides by extraction of the aqueous 
solution with capryl alcohol in the presence of HC1 has been studied (55). 
In addition to influencing the equilibrium by addition of a common ion, as 
in the above examples and in the extraction of uranyl nitrate in the presence 
of nitric acid, the addition of an organic compound to the solvent phase so 
as to form a coordination compound with the metal and thus increase the 
distribution coefficient can be profitable. Thus, zirconium ions form com- 
plexes with thenoyltrifluoroacetone in benzene and can be separated from 
hafnium by extraction (80). Another technique which may prove useful 
in cases where the aqueous solubilities are low is the addition of hydro- 
tropic substances such as sodium xylenesulfonate, which can increase solu- 
bilities of inorganic substances a thousandfold (109). 

The separation of the rare earth metals by liquid extraction is a most 
useful application, since by this method the tedious recrystallizations usu- 
ally necessary are avoided. The work of Asselin and Comings (7) on the 
separation of neodymium and thorium, and the extensive work of Temple- 
ton (159, 160) and Fischer (48, 49) on separations of lanthanum and neo- 
dymium, zirconium and hafnium, and scandium from its accompanying 
elements has confirmed the success of this technique.

400 LIQUID EXTRACTION 

1. Plot the binodal curve and tie lines and (a) triangular coordinates and (6) rec- 
tangular coordinates of Janecke. 

2. Plot tie-line correlation curves according to Sherwood's method. 

3. Plot simple distribution curves for the acetone between benzene and water. 

4. Plot tie-line correlation curves of the Hand type. On the same set of coordinates, 
plot the binodal-solubility curves, as shown in Fig. 2.28. Determine the constants of 
Eq. (2.11). 

6. Calculate the distribution coefficients [Eq. (2.7)], and plot against acetone con- 
centration in the water-rich phase. 

6. Devise a tie-line correlation curve for the rectangular coordinates of Problem 1 (6). 

7. With the help of the plots of Problems 2, 3, 4, and 6, determine the equilibrium 
concentrations of all three components, in both phases, corresponding to an acetone 
concentration in the water-rich phase of 25%. Compare the results by the various 
methods. 

8. Estimate the concentration of acetone at the plait point. 

9. One hundred pounds of a mixture of the following composition are prepared: 30% 
acetone, 30% benzene, 40% water. Determine the weights and composition of both 
layers after equilibrium is established. 

10. Repeat Problems 1 through 9 for the system water (A)-toluene (J5)-isopropanol

The feedstock has a V.G.C. = 0.876. Calculate the number of stages and yield as a 
function of solvent/oil ratio required to produce a raffinate V.G.C. = 0.805. 

4. Griswold, Chu, and Winsauer [Ind. Eng. Chem. 41, 2352 (1949)] provide very 
complete data on the liquid-liquid and vapor-liquid equilibria in the system ethanol- 
ethyl acetate water. Design a plant and solvent-recovery system for the recovery of 
99.8% ethanol from 50,000 gal. /day of a 5% solution in water, using ethyl acetate as 
extracting solvent. Solvent concentration in the raffinate phase is to be no greater than 
0.001%.
