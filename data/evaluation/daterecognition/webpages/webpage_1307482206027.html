<br>
<img border="0" src="images/punish/ram.jpg" width="159" height="191" align="left">In the 18th Century, Meer Manoo committed indescribable atrocities upon the 
Sikhs and the following saying became very common &quot;Manoo is our sickle, we are 
his crop. As he cuts us down, we double in number�&quot;<br>
<br>
The soul of 18th Century Manoo had in the 80s come into Gobind Ram, the Batala 
Police Chief. Last time, Manoo's death to place after his foot was caught in his 
horse's stirrup and he was dragged until his demise. Perhaps his desire to die 
at the hands of Singhs had yet to be fulfilled and so his spirit had entered 
Gobind Ram. The story of his evils is very long, but still some examples are 
mentioned here. He used to always say that the Sikh will forget their Guru and 
remember him only. He had told all those working under him to rape Sikh girls. 
He used to say, &quot;if their seed is changed only then will the revolutionary 
spirit be taken out of their homes.&quot;<br>
<br>
</span></font><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">The Rape of 
village Gora Choor</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
One night in January 1989 was a night of horror for the residents of village 
Gora Choor. SSP Gobind Ram along with countless police officers surrounded the 
village. A member of Bhai Daleep Singh Babbar's Jatha, Patloo Singh, was staying 
at one Amreek Singh &quot;Shah's&quot; house. This household had no link with the Babbars, 
but because Patloo Singh was sick, he was left here while his companions went to 
Batala to get medicine. In the meantime, an informant informed the police. 
Patloo Singh's body was broken due to typhoid and he was arrested while asleep. 
He had tried to grab the mauser rifle sitting by his bedside, but his arms were 
held down.<br>
<br>
Gobind Ram thundered, &quot;Ok SukRoo Singh (thin/dried up Singh), which Jathebandee 
are you a member of? What's your name?&quot; <br>
<br>
But his roar turned into a kitty cat's purr when Patloo replied, &quot;What's it to 
you? You want to marry your daughter to me or something?&quot;<br>
<br>
After this, Patloo was tortured for two hours but let alone telling about the 
other Singhs, he didn't so much as reveal his real name. When the police began 
to remove Patloo's clothes in front of the whole village and Gobind Ram wanted 
to remove his kacherra, Patloo Singh filled with the spirit of Shaheedee. He 
yelled a jaikaaraa and grabbed Gobind Ram's throat. He pressed his long thumb 
into Gobind Ram's neck. Gobind Ram's eye's began to roll into his head and he 
began to gurgle.<br>
<br>
Gobind Ram shrieked, &quot;Oy! You Mother-******s, Are you only going to free me from 
him when he's killed me?!!&quot; Seven police officers barely managed to free him. 
Patloo was refusing to let go. As they pulled his thumb from Gobind Ram's 
throat, his thumb ripped the skin off and blood began to flow. Gobind Ram took 
out his revolver and shot Patloo. The Singh fell to the ground and became a 
Shaheed.<br>
<br>
Gobind Ram yelled, &quot;Take all the people out of that home�bastards keep these 
people in their homes�sleep with their daughters�take them all out�let's change 
their family blood today.&quot; Hearing Gobind Ram's orders, the police took all of 
Amreek Singh's family out of the home, including all women and children. They 
began to beat the women and children with the butts of their rifles. The CRPF 
(Central Reserve Police Force) and BSF (Border Security Force) officers began to 
tease and harass the women. One BSF officer tried to touch one woman, but she 
wrapped the shawl around her head even tighter around herself. <br>
<br>
Gobind Ram yelled, &quot;Why? What's wrong with his hands? Are their (Singhs') hands 
better? &quot; He began to walk towards the woman and she stood up. <br>
<br>
&quot;They came with guns and asked for food�we gave it to them. What power do the 
weak have before the strong? But they weren't rude like you�&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The bitch serves them like guests eh? Must be her daughter's husbands�&quot; Saying 
this, Gobind Ram became enraged. He uncovered all the women's heads. He also 
removed all the family's clothes. The poor women sat in humiliation with their 
heads down. They were kept like this for two hours. After this, they took Amreek 
Singh Shah, his daughter-in-law, his son and a girl from his relative's home to 
the police station. <br>
<br>
After five days when all were released, the men returned with just bodily pain, 
but the women returned with not only injured bodies, but also with the weight of 
stories of how their spirits were wounded. This was the enforcement of the 
Brahmin &quot;Sudheekaran&quot; (raping non-Hindus to change their race).<br>
<br>
</span></font><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Group 
Interrogation</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
<a href="images/punish/image002.jpg" target="_blank">
<img border="2" src="images/punish/image002_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/punish/image002.jpg" align="left"></a>About ten days after this incident, Gobind Ram's hungry dogs again came back to 
village Gora Choor. All villagers from Gora Choor and the next villages, Kotlee, 
Bhangali, Kasakre, etc, were called to the village's Centre. Gobind Ram 
screamed, &quot;All those between the ages of 15 and 50 go to one side!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All these sons of pigs! Take off their skin! They all give refuge to their 
sons-in-law (Singhs)&quot; The Police followed the orders and began to beat all the 
villagers with thick boards, batons and their rifle butts. Screams were heard 
everywhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll say it first then you repeat! If you don't, we'll beat you even worse. 
Surjan Kaur is a bitch!�..Maninder Kaur is a slut!��Mandeep Kaur is a 
Prostitute!�.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gobind Ram then began to swear at a woman who was an Akali leader and was in the 
Amritsar Jail, accused of giving shelter to the Singhs. First Gobind Ram would 
himself swear and then force all the people to repeat after him.<br>
<br>
&quot;�You bastards! Why don't you say it louder?� You mother��&quot; He grabbed a baton 
and began to beat all the assembled people. Terrified, the villagers began to 
yell the cuss words even louder. He continued to lead them: &quot;Surjan Kaur�..Maninder 
Kaur�..Mandeep Kaur�..&quot;<br>
<br>
People were forced to repeat and hung their heads in shame. Seeing an older 
Sardar with a tied beard who appeared to be a retired soldier, Gobind Ram 
yelled, &quot;You! You pimp�you aren't swearing! Is she your daughter or something??&quot; 
He then showered him with baton blows.<br>
<br>
The older Sardar replied, &quot;Yes�Dirty Bastard�I am a retired Major of the Sikh 
Regiment. And yes, all the daughters of this village are my daughters. I fought 
three wars for this country�bloody nonsense. But I never saw any lowlife dog 
Officer like you before�you Mother****. The entire country's and the entire 
Earth's daughters are my daughters and sisters. They are daughters of every 
Sikh�&quot;Daykh paraieeaa(n) changeeaa(n) maavaa(n) bhaiNaa(n) dheeaa(n) jaaNay�&quot;
<br>
<br>
&quot;Their honour is dead that they keep yelling garbage about their own sisters and 
daughters�I can't bark like them. You know I am a Sikh soldier?&quot; The enraged 
Sikh soldier had even yelled at the other villagers now. Hearing the Sikh 
soldier's bellows, everything became very still.<br>
<br>
Hearing the Sikh soldier, Gobind Ram was burning up. &quot;Oh yeah? You won't 
cuss..?&quot; He began to badly beat the elderly Sikh but he did not so much as utter 
a cry. Instead, he served the police officers a mixture of cuss words in 
English, Urdu and Punjabi.<br>
<br>
&quot;�Take him away! We'll do his Court Marshall at the police station. Then he'll 
see what happens if you mess with Gobind Ram. Why are you all quiet?? Bark! 
Bark!!!&quot; Gobind Ram ordered all the villagers and police officers. The Police 
Party took the old Sikh to Fatehgarh ChooReeaa(n) police station.<br>
<br>
&quot;�Let Surjan Kaur come back from jail�just watch if I don't make her dance naked 
in front of all the village. And tell your brave warrior Karam Singh (Babbar) 
that when I get a hold of him, I'll see his bravery myself. And the rest of you 
big Sikhs�if you keep sheltering those bastards, I'm going to beat you to death 
and throw you into the river Beas�&quot;. He threatened the entire village and gave 
an open challenge to Bhai Karam Singh and all of Babbar Khalsa. He had invited 
his own death.<br>
<br>
Gobind Ram's party then left for their holes in the ground and the next day, the 
elderly Sikh officer's naked body was found in the village Centre. The people 
picked it up and took it away. The brave soldier was true to his word. His body 
was ripped apart like cotton but the glow of Khalsa Spirit was still shining 
from his face.</span></font></span></p>

<br>
An oppressor thinks that after he has committed his evils, people will be 
terrified. They will forget their honour and pride and bow before him. This does 
not always happen. It is said that a crowd has no mind, but sometimes there are 
some people with a mind in the crowd who stand up and agree to have their heads 
cut off but will never allow themselves to bow before an oppressor.<br>
<br>
When the news of Gobind Ram�s challenge came to Bhai Karam Singh, Bhai Sahib 
published a reply in the daily newspapers. He wrote, <br>
<br>
�Next Tuesday we will be coming to the bridge at the Nasarkay stream. I will 
wait for you all day. We�ll have our battle there. You�re harassing innocent 
people for nothing and this fight is between the two of us. You come with your 
government�s force and I�ll come with my Guru�s Babbar force. I�ll come with the 
support of my Guru and you can come with the support of your government and its 
machinery. Why are you needlessly killing innocent mothers� sons? Gobind Ram, 
it�s true that not every jungle has a lion in it, but sometimes, you enter a den 
filled with just lions. And then a dog of the government, like you, can�t find 
any way to run. You must come. The weapons in the hands of the Khalsa will wait 
for you all day. <br>
<br>
In eagerness to meet you and test your mettle,<br>
Guru Panth Daa Daas,<br>
<br>
Karam Singh (Babbar Khalsa)�<br>
<br>
Bhai Sahib�s announcement terrified Gobind Ram. For days, he refused to even 
look towards the assigned place the Singhs had announced. The Singhs were eager 
to avenge the death of Patloo Singh and punish Gobind Ram and his butchers.<br>
<br>
In these days, another incident took place. Two secret Babbar workers were 
arrested from Mehta Chownk. They were remanded to Gobind Ram�s custody where he 
brutally killed them. Along with those two Singhs, three other completely 
innocent youths were also killed. One young boy was a student of the twelfth 
grade and was the only brother of four sisters. All five Singhs were killed in a 
fake encounter. The young boy was just 16 years old. His mother cried herself 
blind.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Dealing With Gobind Ram�s �Black Cats�</span></strong></span><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
The Singhs in Batala Police District were completely enraged. One day, our 
entire Jatha was staying in village Dalaer Khurd. Gobind Ram�s gang, with orange 
dastaars tied on their heads and Klashnikov rifles in their hands entered the 
village. One resident of the village, Malkeet Singh had arranged the marriage of 
his daughter and the gang of 20 goons entered into his home. The people at home 
thought they were Singhs and gave them food to eat. After eating their fill, the 
leader of the Black Cat party, Jasvinder Singh Kala explained why he had come. 
(Black Cats were gangs used by Punjab Police to defame Singhs. They dressed up 
like Singhs but did horrendous crimes so that normal village-people would turn 
against the movement).<br>
<br>
Kala asked, �Who�s the owner of this house?�<br>
<br>
Malkeet Singh replied, �Uh�Baba jee�.yes�I understand you�re Singhs�� He was 
terrified. He was begging Guru jee to save him from these people as he had no 
idea who they were. <br>
<br>
Kala shamelessly replied with a terrifying laugh, �Yeah�absolutely right. 
Babas�Khalistani Babas. HAHAHA� His other goons also began to laugh.<br>
<br>
�Ok then. Give us all the girl�s jewelry and any other valuables.� He loaded his 
rifle and pointed it at Malkeet Singh.<br>
<br>
�But Baba jee�I�m poor�how will I marry off my daughter?�<br>
<br>
�Don�t worry about that. We�ll take care of that. You just bring us the goods. 
You don�t want us to make you Khalistan?� He put the barrel against the owner�s 
back. Malkeet Singh took all the valuables in his home and handed them over.<br>
<br>
�Ok, now to take care of your daughter, right? We forgot all about that didn�t 
we?� Kala grabbed the girl, who standing inside, by the arm and threw her on the 
bed which was going to be given at her marriage. The girl began to scream.<br>
<br>
Malkeet Singh pleaded, �Baba jee, you asked for what you wanted and we gave it 
to you. We considered you Guru�s Singhs and respected you�but please don�t do 
this�for Guru�s sake!� In the meantime, the fifteen year old son of the house 
went inside and grabbed a pitchfork which he thrust into the stomach of one of 
Kala�s thugs. Another gang member immediately shot the boy who fell dead on the 
spot.<br>
<br>
Our entire Jatha heard the sound of the bullets. We were coincidentally only a 
few houses away from where Kala was so our entire Jatha of 20-25 Singhs went to 
where we heard the noise. We saw the naked girl lying on the bed and the blood 
soaked body of the young boy and we understood what was going on.<br>
<br>
One Singh in the Jatha yelled out, �Oy! That�s Kala, one of Gobind Ram�s 
Cats�!!�<br>
<br>
Bhai Karam Singh bellowed, �Family members, go hide inside. We�ll take care of 
this. Kill the gang but I want Kala alive! Start the attack!!�<br>
<br>
All the Babbars opened fire and our rifles began to spit fire. The family 
members had no idea what was going on, but all ran and hid. Kala�s gang also 
opened fire in which two Singhs were injured. The Singhs were yelling �Akaal!! 
Akaal!!� and spraying bullets. Bhai Daleep Singh took out his new gun, the GPM 
and let it loose. After half an hour of firing, the other side became calm and 
the house�s courtyard was filled with bodies. The sound of bullets was replaced 
with sound of groans and cries. There were a total of 11 bodies. Two Singhs from 
our Jatha were also injured. From the family, only the one boy had been killed, 
who had been shot before we arrived. Kala, along with four injured thugs was 
captured. The Girl put on clothes inside and then fell at Bhai Karam Singh�s 
feet. �Brother, if you didn�t come today then�.Oh my god! My brother!� Seeing 
her brother�s body, the girl began to sob.<br>
<br>
Bhai Karam Singh tried to console the girl, �No Sister, compose yourself. These 
were government agents. Your brother is a martyr�a martyr in the battle for 
Khalistan.�<br>
<br>
�In the morning, take the boy�s body for cremation and bring us a truck so that 
we can throw these dusht�s bodies into the Beas.� After the truck arrived, the 
entire Jatha loaded the bodies onto the truck and Kala with his companions was 
tied up and brought to the banks of the river Beas. The bodies were thrown in.<br>
<br>
Bhai Daleep Singh broke the slience, �Ok, let�s do their Antim Saskaar as well.� 
One Singh took a five litre can and filled it with diesel from the truck. <br>
<br>
�Hai! Oy Baba jee! We�re your servants�!� Gobind Ram�s lions had become goats.
<br>
<br>
The Singhs drenched the five thugs in diesel and threw a match at them. The dark 
night was lit up by the five who ran about for some time and then themselves 
jumped into the river.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Attacks on the BSF</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
The next day, the Singhs saw a four wheeler filled with BSF officers.<br>
<br>
Bhai Daleep Singh asked, �Bhaoo, what�re the orders?� He was shining the barrel 
of his GPM with a cloth.<br>
<br>
Bhai Karam Singh replied, �No�not today�Let them make a routine of things.�<br>
<br>
In the meantime, at Amritsar, Bhai Gurnam Singh blew up a BSF tanker with a 
grenade and announced that Babbar Khalsa would make new grenade and bomb Jathas.<br>
<br>
The four-wheeler made its rounds for three or four days when on the fifth, a 
massive explosion came from the road and the Madrasis inside were all smeared 
onto the ground. All 15 Madrasis had to be scraped off the ground.<br>
<br>
A couple days later, we overheard to villagers talking amongst themselves about 
the explosion: �See that Bhaoo? The Guru Singh�s did something amazing eh? The 
next day the BSF were going to people�s houses looking for all the �spare 
parts��Here�s Sahib jee�s leg and there�s Vada Sahib jee�s arm with all his 
ribbons! HAHAH�<br>

</span></font><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">The Story of 
Harjeet Kaur</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
Because of these attacks, the police in Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Batala were all 
furious. They began to torture all normal residents. They would keep people for 
in police stations for no reason and rape the daughters of those Gursikhs who 
gave shelter to the Singhs. In village Leharkaa, we along with the Khalistan 
Liberation Force�s Bhai Jugraj Singh Toofan had a place we stayed. That 
household had a daughter who studied in the 10th grade. The police gave her a 
treatment which left our hairs standing on end. This girl was called Harjeet 
Kaur and her father and brother were already in Amritsar jail for giving shelter 
to the Singhs. Harjeet Kaur along with her older sister Parmveer went to meet 
them, when they caught the eye of SSP PK Sharma. That evening, Sharma came to 
village Leharkaa and took the girl to the police station, where she was badly 
tortured. That young body was subjected to third degree tortures. She was beaten 
with thick boards and hung upside down. They even put salt and chili pepper in 
her private parts. But this young Bibi did not even name a single Singh who came 
to her house. After she refused to do so, she was taken into a room where she 
was blindfolded and all night seven or eight police officers, along with Sharma 
raped her. She fell unconscious. When she regained her senses, she found herself 
lying alone and naked in the room. <br>
<br>
After they could not take any information from her, the police released Harjeet 
Kaur. She was in a very bad state. She could not even walk properly. Her spirit 
had been broken and soon after, she hung herself and committed suicide.<br>
<br>
</span></font><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">The Last Straw
</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS">
<span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
Like Sharma, Gobind Ram also began to harass normal people. Finally, his evil 
reached its limit when he arrested the wives of Bhai Mehal Singh Babbar and Bhai 
Kulwant Singh Babbar. Both women worked in a bank and supported their children.<br>
<br>
On August 21st, 1989, a van with tinted windows pulled in front of the bank. Six 
armed men got out and asked the women to come with them.<br>
<br>
The women answered, �Who knows who you are? How can we go with someone we don�t 
even know?�<br>
<br>
�Look at my ID. I�m Lakhwinder Singh Lakha, ASI. Now shut up and start walking 
with us or you�re going to be disrespected.� The ASI was yelling his threat.<br>
<br>
The women began to yell and said, �We won�t go! How are you going to take us? 
You�ve got big dastaars and look like you�re the sons of Sikhs, have some 
shame!�<br>
<br>
The ASI ordered his assistants, �Oy Shera! Pick them up and throw them in the 
van! People are going to start to gather and make a scene and our job will get 
harder.�. The officer followed his orders and forcibly took off the women�s 
dastaars, and tied their hands with them and threw them in the van. Their 
kirpaans were also taken off. They began to drive towards Batala�s �Beco� 
Interrogation Centre.</span></font></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black">The Indian media calls us 
terrorists, but our fight is for our own nation. We have taken to the path of 
violence to free our motherland from India. War is not our hobby. It is our 
compulsion. We call the land between the Ghaghar River and the Chenab our own 
and fight for it. Before 1849, the Khalsa owned all this land so how are we 
terrorists? We are fighting for the land that the Brahmins took from us by 
cheating, after the British left. <br>

<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Torture of the Two Singhnees</span></strong></span><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
For every soldier of Khalistan and his family, no matter with what luxuries they 
were raised, must come the time of testing. Today, that time had come for the 
Singhnees of Bhai Kulwant Singh Cashier and Bhai Mehal Singh. People say that a 
prison is worse than a grave and even darker than the pits of hell. And if the 
person running that prison is a Jamdoot like Gobind Ram, imagine what kind of a 
place that would be.<br>
<br>
Lakha ASI and his gang of butchers arrived at the Beco Centre with the two 
Singhnees. The clock on the wall read 7:15pm. A Sikh youth was hanging upside 
down from the ceiling and Gobind Ram was beating him with a long stick. <br>
<br>
Seeing the two Singhnees come in, Gobind Ram began to spew his filth: &quot;Ah ha! 
Has the Babbar material arrived? Where the hell do they get wives that are 
dressed up like that? They come here with jooRaas on their heads�&quot;<br>
<br>
He walked towards Gurdev Kaur and hit her with his baton in the stomach. He 
struck her below the belly and she fell to the ground, bleeding from her 
privates. For the next eight or nine minutes, he kept striking Gurdev Kaur in 
the stomach as she lay on the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;�Where's your husband? I'm gonna kill him�here, take your Khalistan�Oy Lakha 
you son of a *****, bring the ghotna for your mother here!&quot; (Ghotna is a log 
that is rotated on the legs to rip apart muscles).<br>
<br>
A thick log was brought and placed on the Bibi's legs and on each side, four 
heavy police officers stood up. Gobind Ram kept hitting Bibi Gurdev Kaur's 
joints with his stick.<br>
<br>
Because of blood loss, the Bibi was getting worse and worse, but Gobind Ram kept 
repeating, &quot;Where is Kulwant Singh?&quot; Gurmeet Kaur could not bear to watch 
anymore and turned her face away.<br>
<br>
&quot;And look at this slut's tricks�&quot; Gobind Ram left Gurdev Kaur and began to beat 
Gurmeet Kaur. Gobind Ram called on a man with a black turban, &quot;Hand me a rope�&quot; 
He tied Gurmeet Kaur's hands and then threw her to the ground with a shove. He 
put a heavy board on her legs and had 4 police officers stand on it. Gobind Ram 
kept kicking her in the chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to dishonour you to my heart's content. What're your husbands going 
to do? Big Babbars�.bloody enemies of our country�&quot; He kept talking his filth 
and also began to offer incentives to turn Bhai Mehal Singh and Bhai Sukhdev 
Singh in. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look, if you convince them to turn themselves in, I'll spare their lives and 
I'll also get them positions in the police force.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both women were crying out, &quot;We know nothing! Since they've left home, we've 
never met them. We just work and support our children�&quot; Their cries were 
piercing the air.<br>
<br>
Seeing the dogs of India's so-called &quot;Ram Raj&quot; in the land of Sita and Daropati 
committing such acts must have made even Ravan himself shudder. After five hours 
of non-stop torture, both women fell unconscious. But each time they lost 
consciousness, they were given water and brought back and the process would 
begin again. An animal, after going through Halal does not have to go through it 
again, but here these two frail women underwent halal over and over again after 
being taken to the brink of death and then brought back repeatedly. Gobind Ram 
kept repeating &quot;Give us Mehal Singh, Give us Kulwant Singh.&quot;<br>

nearing her death, the police secretly took her to the government hospital and 
left her there. Gurmeet Kaur's right leg was paralysed and both were kept awake 
for many days. Someone was called from the outside to massage her leg. She could 
not walk but they forced her to do so. In the hospital, a merciful lady doctor 
took care of Gurdev Kaur and also informed her family.</span></font><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Courier New; color: black"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
News of all this reached the media and all political religious and social 
organizations condemned Gobind Ram's actions. When finally Gurmeet Kaur refused 
to hand over any Singh, she was threatened with being killed. By now though, 
because the press had gotten wind of the arrest, she was indicted in a false 
case and sent to jail. <br>

but for the rest of her life she would face health problems. <br>
<br>
Things like this were happening to all Sikh Militants' families. Bhai Sukhdev 
Singh Babbar's nephew was also beaten to death.<br>

Singhs' Families</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
In Ropar District, Bhai Didar Singh Daaree was walking on a dirt path in his 
village of Havara(n) Kala(n) when the police attempted to surround him. Bhai 
Didar Singh went into a nearby field and an encounter began. Didar Singh had 
quite a bit of ammunition and so the encounter lasted for 48 hours in which two 
police inspectors and quite a few police officers were killed. After 48 hours, 
bullet-proof tractors were brought in which were successful in hunting Bhai 
Didar Singh down. A police force led by Sumedh Saini fell onto Havara(n) Kala(n) 
and grabbed Bhai Didar Singh's simple amritdhari brother, who was not involved 
in anything. They beat him and then brought him to his brother's body. Seeing 
the body, the brother began to weep, &quot;My beautiful brother�why couldn't I have 
died in your place?? Where am I going to find a father for you small children? 
How will your little daughter pass her days?&quot; The brother collapsed on Didar 
Singh's body. The police pulled him off and then beat him senseless. Even today 
he wanders the alleys of the village in complete silence.<br>
<br>
In village Ganga in Bathinda, Babbar Khalsa's Malwa Zone Chief, Bhai Balwinder 
Singh Ganga's father Sd. ChanaN Singh was shot in his sleep by the police.<br>

police in which he did a lot of damage and as revenge, the police kidnapped his 
wife, two brothers and their wives and had them killed.<br>
<br>
BTF's head, Baba Gurbachan Singh Manochahal's brothers and father were all 
killed.<br>
<br>
KCF chief Bhai Parmjit Singh's mother was also kidnapped and killed.<br>

funeral in Ropar. Sumedh Saini was very annoyed at this and the day after the 
bhog, he lit eight members of Bhai JataNa's family on fire and burnt them alive 
including his four year old niece and 90 year old grandmother. The Singhs too, 
although facing serious losses, tried to punish the oppressors. Two bomb attacks 
took place against Sumedh Saini but by luck, he survived both times.<br>
<br>
The Babbar Chief for Doaba, Bhai Harminderveer Singh TaiNee was going to 
Anandpur Sahib for Hola Mohalla with his Singhnee when an informer told the 
police near Khanna. The bus was stopped and an ASI officer grabbed Bhai TaiNee 
by the wrist when Bhai Sahib's Singhnee, Bibi Manjeet Kaur, who was herself a 
Babbar, took a pistol out of her purse and fired three bullets, blowing the ASI 
officer's skull off. TaiNee didn't want to harm the passengers on the bus so he 
took a cyanide pill even though he had a filled assault rifle in his bag. Bhai 
Sahib's Singhnee also shot herself and the couple became shaheeds together. Bhai 
TaiNee's father, Master Amreek Singh was attacked after this but he survived 
with serious wounds.<br>
<br>
</span></font><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">When They Were

<img border="2" src="images/punish/image009_small1.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/punish/image009.jpg" align="left"></a>Not only did Singhs' families face such atrocities, but those who sheltered them 
also faced horrible torture. In village Kilee Bodlaa(n), Bhai Heera Singh Babbar 
and Bhai Resham Singh had a hideout in a teacher's field. One day at noon time, 
their entire Jatha was eating when an informer had the Ferozepur Police surround 
the house. The Singhs did not think it was right to fight while in the house 
because women and children could be injured and so the Singhs jumped a wall and 
ran to the fields. The police opened fire and after the encounter, three police 
officers and two Singhs were killed. Bhai Resham Singh was one of them, but Bhai 
Heera Singh survived and made his escape with the others. <br>
<br>
The police took all the bodies and left but that evening, even before the sun 
had gone down, the police returned and surrounded the house. There was no Singh 
in the house now but they threw a grenade onto the roof and blew it open. The 
entire family including women and children were taken out and tied to a tree and 
the police began to beat them with their batons. The screams of the women, 
children and other family members forced the villagers to shut all their doors.
<br>
<br>
The sun, perhaps in shame, set earlier than usual, but the butcher police 
officers of this Indian &quot;Ram Raj&quot; felt no shame at all. They took diesel out of 
the tractor in the home and heated it up in a pot. The family members' clothes 
were ripped off. A police officer went to the kitchen and got a vegetable 
shredder and then began to skin the family members alive. When the diesel began 
to boil, the butchers took jugs and big ladles and began to pour it on to the 
shredded skin. The women and children's shrieks shook the earth and the heavens 
but the stone hearted butchers were not affected and kept laughing their evil 
laughs. <br>
<br>
Death danced in that courtyard for a full four hours and it finally ended when 
every family member fell unconscious after their bodies were horribly burnt. The 
police shot each family member dead. Out of the entire family, only the 
family-head who had gone to the city and a small girl who had hidden in the 
flower garden in all the commotion, survived.</span></font></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black">In all of Punjab�s districts, the 
oppressors were running wild. There was terror amongst the common people. At 
various places, the brave Singhs too were replying to the oppression. In Malwa, 
the Singhs killed the murderers of Bhai Balwinder Singh Ganga�s father. In the 
Majha Zone, Gobind Ram was a constant irritation for the Singhs.<br>

Bhai Jugraj Singh decalared, �that bloody butcher�progeny of Meer Mannu�he�s 
going to fly 25 feet high when I�m done with him�But Babio, we have very little 
atta (meaning flour but a codeword for explosives), if you could help us with 
that?�<br>
<br>
Bhai Gurnam Singh Babbar, chief of the Majha Zone replied, �that�s not a problem 
Bhai Sahib jee. You�ll get as much atta as you need. Just prepare yourselves to 
punish that dusht. It doesn�t matter frankly who gets him, but he should not get 
away.�<br>

<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Trip to Amritsar</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
After the meeting concluded, I went with Bhai Gurnam Singh and some other Singhs 
to Sree Amritsar. We had come to have darshan of Sree Darbaar Sahib. We left our 
equipment at one of Bhai Gurnam Singh�s safe-houses and then left. We listened 
to keertan for some time and then decided to go to the bazaar that evening.<br>
<br>
One University student who lived at the safe-house gave his suggestion that we 
not go out empty-handed as there were security officials everywhere. We came 
back to the room and armed ourselves. Two Singhs grabbed assault rifles and 
wrapped shawls around themselves while us three remaining Singhs each took a 
pistol.<br>
<br>
In the bazaar, we saw a car with flashing red lights approaching and Satvinder 
Singh said, �It looks like the prey is coming by himself�It looks like Gobind 
Ram! It�s his car at any rate��<br>
<br>
I asked Bhai Gurnam Singh, �Well Jathedar Sahib, what do you think?�<br>
<br>
Taking his revolver out, Bhai Gurnam Singh replied, �we�ve finally got an 
opportunity, what�s there to think about? Let�s do it.�<br>
<br>
I looked behind the car and said, �Yes, but who�s going to take care of them?� 
referring to the jeep filled with security guards.<br>
<br>
�You two with the assault rifles go meet the security jeep, us three will take 
the main man.� With this, Bhai Gurnam Singh began to walk quickly towards Gobind 
Ram�s Ambassador car.<br>
The Car was started but parked. Gobind Ram was inside but his son was inside a 
book store. We hadn�t yet reached Gobind Ram when the two Singhs opened fire on 
the security jeep.<br>
<br>
�Rajan! Run�.� Yelled Gobind Ram as he heard the bullets. By this time we three 
hade begun to shoot his car as well. The driver immediately turned the car 
around and Gobind Ram began to shoot at us with his service revolver.<br>
<br>
With a cry of �Hai! Papa! Gobind Ram�s son fell in the crossfire as he was 
reaching the car. The driver was wounded but sped away. The security jeep went 
out of control and smashed into a tomato cart, leaving tomato chutney all over 
the street. After our magazines were empty, we jumped a wall and hid in a 
garden.<br>
<br>
Satvinder Singh said, �Looks like he got away��<br>
Bhai Gurnam Singh replied, �It�s possible�are all our Singhs in chardee kalaa?�<br>
<br>
�We�re all fine, but the hasty Singhs with their assault rifles haven�t returned 
yet� I said, worried about their fate. After a little while they returned as 
well.<br>
<br>
�Well Singho, we�ll find out in tomorrow�s newspaper what happened and who�s 
chutney we made. Now let�s get out of here�� We took Bhai Gurnam Singh�s advice 
and all left the city for secure locations. The next day, the newspapers all 
featured the story on Gobind Ram being injured and his son being killed in an 
attack.<br>
<br>
</span></font><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Hunt Moves to 
Jalandhar</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
Gobind Ram was transferred to the Jalandhar Police Training Centre. Maybe he 
considered himself safe at that place, but fate was laughing at this thought of 
his.<br>
<br>
Bhai Jugraj Singh met up with us and complained, �Babio, you havn�t gotten the 
atta to me?� Bhai Gurnam Singh gave me a bag filled with explosives and sent me 
to Bhai Jugraj Singh�s hideout. Bhai Jugraj Singh met me with a lot of love.<br>
<br>
Bhai Jugraj Singh gave his Fateh and hugged me. He looked at the bag and said, 
�Our Force is just carrying around guns, this time I�m going to ask for 
explosives too. I like the Babbars� style of doing things with bombs.�<br>
<br>
I said to Jugraj Singh, �But Khalsa jee, he�s gone and hidden himself in some 
hole in Jalandhar?�<br>
<br>
�That�s no big deal, the Khalsa will go after him. The Guru�s lions can even go 
to London to get their man.�<br>
<br>
The next day we went to another hideout where a young man with a cut beard sat 
us down. Bhai Jugraj Singh asked, �Well ChoohaR Singh, Nikka hasn�t returned?�<br>
�He�s come bhaji, he came back yesterday. He�s here somewhere�let me check. Oy! 
Nikkaa! Baba jee�s here!� At the call, a young Singh who had absolutely no beard 
came and gave Bhai Toofan a fateh. In a very young age, Bhai Jugraj Singh had 
developed a very good reputation in the entire area.<br>
<br>
�Well friend, where�s your duty these days?� asked Bhai Toofan.<br>
<br>
�I�ll tell you Baba jee, but first you should introduce me to the mahapurakh 
beside you� the young man said, seemingly uncomfortable with my presence.<br>
<br>
�Oh, don�t be shy around him. This is our own Singh, Mengha Singh Babbar�I�m 
going to put you under him�� Said Bhai Jugraj Singh, taking the young man�s hand 
and putting it in mine.<br>
<br>
The young man grasped my hand tightly and said, �there�s never anything to be 
afraid of, but it�s good to be safe. These day�s I�m posted at Jalandhar, in the 
Training Centre.�<br>
<br>
</span></font><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">The Plan &amp; Justice</span></strong><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: black"><br>
<br>
A few days later, according to the plan, we rented a store near the Training 
Centre to sell tea and snacks. We hired a cook and arranged for samosas, toast, 
puri/chholay, etc. We also rented a room in the Dogar colony of the city. Our 
young friend visited us there every day and this helped prepare him mentally for 
his job. We taught him about Gurmat�s revolutionary principles. We gave Nikka 
the job of telling us when we had the opportunity to do our job. The bomb was 
ready with about 10-12 Kg of explosives attached to a detonator. The bomb in 
total was about 20 Kg and we stored it in our restaurant with some broken 
utensils and other garbage. <br>
<br>
We wore long kurtas and chaadraas like truck drivers. Amongst the customers that 
came, we spread the story that we were failed truck drivers who decided to open 
a restaurant.<br>
<br>
How long could Gobind Ram keep us away? One day at around quarter after seven in 
the evening, Nikka came to us. �Baba jee, today is a great opportunity. Gobind 
Ram and his gang have gone into the city to see some �Star Show� with dancing 
movie actors. Most of the police are busy with security. <br>
<br>
�And the sentry party?� I asked?<br>
<br>
�Baba jee, those low-lifes caught some young girl today and are busy with her 
now. I managed to slip away. Now�s the time. Go fit the bomb��<br>
<br>
Bhia Jugraj Singh put the bomb in a sack and gave the remote control to me. He 
put on a Commando uniform and left with Nikka.<br>
<br>
�Babbaraa, do ardaas to Sachay Patshaah for our success�� said Bhai Jugraj Singh 
as he was leaving. It felt as if some 18th century Shaheed was speaking through 
him.<br>
<br>
After about half an hour, Jugraj Singh came back and I asked, �Well Babio, how 
did it go?�<br>
<br>
�Sachay Patshaah did kirpaa. You check the cells for the remote. I fit the bomb 
under his chair. That Brahmin�s going to fly 25 feet high. Sachay Patshaah, may 
your Panth have victory!� Bhai Jugraj Singh put his hands together in ardaas.<br>
<br>
Now we waited for the dusht to come back. We kept looking at Nikka while sitting 
in our restaurant. At around 10.30pm, Gobind Ram�s car returned with its siren 
wailing. We saw Nikka saluting Gobind Ram in the lights, and Gobind Ram got out 
and began to walk towards his office.<br>
<br>
Bhai Toofan grabbed the remote from me and pointed it towards the office. We 
were within range. We waited for Nikka�s signal and every second same like an 
epoch.<br>
<br>
<a href="images/punish/image011.jpg" target="_blank">
<img border="2" src="images/punish/image011_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/punish/image011.jpg" align="left"></a>After about three minutes, our wait ended as Nikka flashed his torch at us. Bhai 
Jugraj Singh became alert right away. Nikka flashed the torch a second time and 
Bhai Toofan�s thumb came and rested on the button. When the torch flashed a 
third time, Bhai Jugraj Singh called on Dashmesh Pita and pressed the button 
with full force. Like the clap of thunder, �BOOOOMMMM� the bomb exploded. Gobind 
Ram along with all the things in his office and the office beside his flew at 
least 50 feet high. Nikka, standing at the
gate, yelled �Sat Sree Akaal!� and rand towards us.<br>
<br>
Bhai Jugraj Singh yelled at Nikka, �Go back! You�re going to cause us some other 
problem for us now!�<br>
<br>
Because of the explosion, many rooms in the Training Centre were now ablaze. The 
Centre was filled with screams and wails. All the workers were running around 
and bumping into each other in terror.<br>
<br>
Nikka flashed the victory symbol and said, �Babio, the bastard was going to 
leave and then I don�t know what happened, he just went straight for his 
office.� Nikka was having trouble hiding his joy.<br>
<br>

<img border="2" src="images/punish/image012_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/punish/image012.jpg" alt="Gobind Ram�s Remains" align="left"></a>Bhai Toofan addressed the both of us, �Ok Nikka, you go back. Bhai Sahib, let�s 
get out of here.�<br>
<br>
�Ballay Babio! What kind of friendship is this? I�m not going to get caught by 
these butchers! The first thing they�re going to do is start to beat all the 
guys on sentry duty.� Nikka decided to come with us. All three of us put on 
Commando uniforms and left the city. A few days later, Nikka was named the Area 
Commander for Baba Bakala.</span></font></span></p>
