                    reached from Europe, and it rivals the Caribbean, the western 
                    Indian Ocean and other more expensive destinations in the 
                    quality of its diving. Compared to other places, dive sites 
                    can be crowded, particularly those suitable for novice divers 
                    near the main resorts of Hurghada and Sharm al Sheik. However 
                    there is generally a lot to see at all sites, and for advanced 
                    divers the wall and wreck diving is spectacular. </b></font></p>

                    is generally good (10 to 50 or more metres) although it can 
                    be reduced during periods with high plankton growth or sediment 
                    in the water column due to wind - this can happen at any time 
                    of year but is probably most common in spring. In general, 
                    visibility in the north (Sharm al Sheik, Ras Mohammad, Hurghada) 
                    is best in the winter, when the water is cold, but in the 
                    south (Quseir, Marsa Alam) it is best in the summer when the 
                    water is hot enough to reduce plankton growth. </font></b></p>

                    to about 18oC. In August, water temperatures are as high as 
                    29oC and a skin or 3mm wetsuit is adequate - and plenty of 
                    sunscreen and water since air temperatures regularly reach

                    of Aqaba </i><br>
                    The Gulf of Aqaba is deep, and, because the sediment sinks 
                    quickly to deep water, clear. Although it does not have as 
                    many coral species as the Red Sea coast proper (about 130 
                    species of hard coral and about 120 species of soft corals 
                    - sea fans, fire coral etc.) the reefs are spectacular on 
                    the Egyptian side of the Gulf (the east coast of the Sinai 
                    peninsula). In general, the reefs get more developed and impressive 
                    as you move south, culminating in the diverse reefs and impressive 
                    wall dives around Sharm al Sheikh and the Ras Mohammad National 
                    Park on the southern tip of Sinai.</font></b></p>

                    of Suez</i><br>
                    Unlike the Gulf of Aqaba, the Gulf of Suez is shallow, with 
                    an average depth of around 20-30 metres. Shallow depth, strong 
                    winds and a sandy bottom mean that the water column tends 
                    to have sediment in it, and this along with cool winter temperatures 
                    makes it difficult for many Red Sea species to survive. There 
                    is very little coral in the northern Gulf, and in the southern 
                    half, reefs are patchy, with only around 45-50 species represented. 
                    The opening of the Suez Canal has created a link with the 
                    Mediterranean for the first time, and scientists are interested 
                    inmonitoring the exchange of species between the two regions, 
                    as well as the effect of physiological stress </font></b></p>

                    Mohammad </i><br>
                    Ras Mohammad is the headland on the southern tip of Sinai, 
                    which along with the surrounding marine area has been turned 
                    into a very successful National Park. It is a spectacular 
                    setting, with high cliffs surrounded by reef, mangrove and 
                    seagrass meadows. It is the most northerly point in the world 
                    where mangroves occur. The exceptionally clear water means 
                    that reefs extend to over 100 metres deep. The drop-off, covered 
                    in coral, is steep and close to shore in some places, making 
                    for excellent wall diving. There are large numbers of reef 
                    fish and large pelagic (open water) species; species of particular 
                    interest to divers include Napoleon wrasse, sharks and barracudas, 
                    as well as green turtles and invertebrates like giant clams. 
                    Strong currents make it a good environment for sea fans and 
                    other soft corals which feed by filtering particles out of 
                    the water column, however they also mean that some experience 
                    is required to dive here. </b></font></p>

                    diving and snorkelling site from the resort of Hurghada. There 
                    are a lot of good shallow reef sites with numerous fish, often 
                    unafraid of humans. Formerly the dive industry was uncontrolled 
                    and there has been coral damage from boat anchoring and collecting 
                    for souvenirs (please don't buy souvenirs of coral or marine 
                    animals). However the dive community has largely cleaned up 
                    its act, installing permanent mooring buoys and becoming more 
                    conscious of the need to protect the reef on which it depends. 
                    Both the Giftun Islands and the Hurghada area have extensive 
                    seagrass beds, in fact just off the beach by the Sheraton 
                    in Hurghada is some of the best seagrass beds in Egypt, with 
                    mixed stands of 5 seagrass species. The Giftun Islands also 
                    have one of the largest stands of mangroves on the Egyptian 
                    coast and important nesting grounds for hawksbill turtles 
                    and seabirds. </font></b></p>

                    As you move south away from Hurghada, the coast becomes less 
                    developed than further north - visiting this area is more 
                    difficult and expensive but you are rewarded with less crowds, 
                    unspoiled beaches, desert scenery and some spectacular dives. 
                    The reef is well developed with generally high coral cover 
                    and a lot of relief: gullies, overhangs and caves. The fish 
                    fauna is generally diverse and abundant since fishing pressure 
                    is low. Both coral and fish diversity generally increase moving 
                    south, since the Red Sea reaches its peak of diversity in 
                    the centre (Sudan / Saudi Arabia). The very south of Egypt 
                    (Gebel Elba) is a military zone. The reefs are likely to be
