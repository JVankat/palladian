    <p>In a disturbing new trend, we have seen insurers simply withdrawing from defending their insureds in the middle of the litigation.&nbsp; There is substantial case law supporting the proposition that once defending, an insurer can only withdraw if a court permits it.&nbsp; However, generally an insurer cannot sue its insured while the law suit the insurer is defending is still on going because that would unfairly put an insured in a two front war.&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution for the insurer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the insured in an even worse situation by yanking the defense midstream in the lawsuit!</p>
<p>As the&nbsp;primary reason&nbsp;a business&nbsp;would&nbsp;purchase the&nbsp;liability insurance in the first place&nbsp;is for financial protection against&nbsp;law suits, it hardly seems fair that an insurer can start defending but in the middle of the suit because some claims were dismissed, the insurer can just walk out and leave the insured twisting in the wind.&nbsp; There are a number of courts who agree insurers cannot do so.&nbsp; For example in <em><a href="http://www.nossaman.com/Files/33932_2010%20US%20App%20LEXIS%2021624.pdf">Goerner v Axis </a></em>&nbsp;the directors and officers insurer settled claims against the corporation&nbsp;and&nbsp;the plaintiff amended the complaint taking most references to the corporation away.&nbsp; Axis then asserted the second amended complaint (that lacked claims against the insured's company) then only asserted claims against the insured as an individual and walked away leaving the insured defenseless against the claims.&nbsp; The insurer studiously ignored that the insured was sued for acts he undertook for the benefit of his company.&nbsp; The insured had to settle the claims as he could not afford to fund his own defense and sue Axis for wrongfully pulling the defense.&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit court of appeals agreed with the insured and applied the standard rule that where the facts support the conclusion that there was a continuing potential for coverage (in this case that the insured <em>was </em>acting for his company) then Axis had to continue to defend.&nbsp;The insured is now entitled to damages from Axis including the cost of his defense and the settlement, and perhaps tort damages as well.</p>
<p>We have seen other insurers attempt the same gambit--if it happens to you, call coverage counsel for assistance, as the law is on your side!</p>

    <p>The law is settled, though not often enforced, that an insurer defending under a reservation of rights may settle the claim and seek to recover the settlement funds from the insured if there was in fact no coverage for the claim; provided that the insurer must give the insured the option to undertake the further defense of the claim if it does not wish to risk such a claim for indemnity.&nbsp; Blue Ridge Ins. Co. v. Jacobsen (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 489.&nbsp; But how much notice must the insurer give the insured?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In a recent case, the trial court submitted to the jury the question whether the notice had been given in sufficient time to allow the insured to evaluate its options.&nbsp; The jury found &quot;no;&quot; but the appellate court ruled that this was not a proper issue in the case.&nbsp; It relied on language in the Blue Ridge case, which did not involve this precise issue, to rule that adequate notice was given when the insurer originally advised the insured that it would defend under a reservation of rights and might seek recovery of any judgment or settlement funds later.&nbsp; That, the court held, was all the notice to which the insured was entitled.&nbsp;&nbsp; American Modern Home Ins. Co. v. Fahmian (April 8, 2011) 2011 DJDAR 5152.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is a terrible decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; Blue Ridge, the insurer had submitted the offer to the policyholders and engaged in some correspondence with them about the matter.&nbsp; The policyholders then squarely rejected the proposed settlement, with notice that Blue Ridge might settle and try to hold them responsible for the settlement.&nbsp; Only then did Blue Ridge settle the case and then sue the insureds for its recovery.&nbsp; Thus, whatever language in Blue Ridge stated that the insurer had met its obligations when it had initially&nbsp; advised&nbsp; the policyholders that it might settle and try to recover from them, and when it later gave them notice, really did not address the question whether the insureds should be allowed sufficient time to evaluate their position before they made their decision.&nbsp; The Fahmian court should have respected the jury's finding that the insured clients were not given time to evaluate the difficult situation they faced:</p>
<p>Their insurer had been defending the case, although under a reservation of rights and advice that it might seek recovery from the insureds if there was a pay-out.&nbsp; The average insured&nbsp; would be relieved that he was being defended, and not spend too much time worrying about a possible indemnity claim that might never come.&nbsp; He should be given a reasonable time to evaluate his options if and when that abstract danger became real.&nbsp; Interestingly, in the reverse situation the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, applying California law, held recently that an insurer's refusal to fund its insured's settlement of a case in a large amount during trial was in bad faith, precisely because the limited time in which the insurer had to evaluate the settlement was sufficient. Schwartz v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 539 F. 3d 135.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Supreme Court should take this case and review it.</p>

    <p>Most people with any knowledge of insurance coverage are familiar with the Cumis rule, first announced by a California appellate court in 1984. It allows an insured whose insurer has agreed to defend a claim but reserved its right to contest coverage, to defend the case through counsel of the insured&rsquo;s (not the insurer&rsquo;s) choice, and requires the insurer to pay for that counsel. The California legislature soon followed up with a framework for such &ldquo;Cumis&rdquo; defenses, under which among other things, the insurer needs to pay only at &ldquo;panel counsel&rdquo; rates (usually significantly lower than general market rates), and the insurer can compel arbitration of any fee disputes for the Cumis counsel.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not necessarily a bed of roses for the insured, who may have to fight the insurer about the fees and may find arbitration not the most hospitable forum. However, a new case this week should help to cut down the more unreasonable demands of insurers in this area.</p>
<p>The Housing Group and others sued their insurers for breach of contract, bad faith, fraud and other wrongs, apparently because the insurers failed to provide and pay for a Cumis defense against certain third party actions. The insurers responded by demanding arbitration, claiming they had paid some of the Cumis fees and this was simply a dispute about whether the payments were sufficient. The trial court denied arbitration, and the court of appeal affirmed.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs&rsquo; contention was that the insurer could not compel arbitration because it had never agreed to defend the underlying cases and because it had made only very partial, untimely payments <em><strong>after</strong></em> the underlying case had been resolved, instead of currently. The trial court ruled for the plaintiffs, finding that the insurers either paid no fees or paid only partially and after the case had been completed.</p>
<p>In a brief opinion, McGuiness, P.J., ruled that without producing evidence that it had fully paid the defense costs currently, at least to the limits of the &ldquo;panel counsel&ldquo; levels, the insurer had in effect refused to defend the underlying cases. That left it in the position of having breached its contract. Thus, it could not dispute the extent of its performance through arbitration.</p>
<p>Thus, if in a situation that requires Cumis counsel the insurer does not unequivocally and timely pay defense costs, at least at the alleged panel counsel rates, it is simply in breach of its contractual obligations and can be sued for breach of contract, possibly for bad faith as well. <em>Housing Group v. PMA Capital Insurance Co., Cal. Ct of Appeal</em>, 3/25/11.</p>
<p>Score one for fair play to policyholders!</p>

    <p><em>We are pleased to include below the comments of colleague, Calvin Reno, Managing Director of <a href="http://www.ajg.com/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=5126&amp;mode=2&amp;in_hi_userid=26148&amp;cached=true">A.J.

</em>&nbsp;<br />
We are pleased to announce the arrival of the first Corporate Liability policy for investigations of securities violations.</p>
<p>As you may know, current D&amp;O policies do not extend coverage to the company/entity for regulatory investigations leaving companies exposed to the high cost of defending them. In an effort to address this exposure, Chartis is offering a product separate from your D&amp;O policy, that seeks to cover certain investigations in relation to &quot;securities violations&quot;. While the form is new and will require critical review to determine the scope of coverage, it is important to recognize this significant change in the Management Liability landscape; hereto-before, carriers had viewed this exposure as uninsurable due to it's open ended nature, high costs and lack of actuarial certain dates defining the claim period (e.g. Office Depot $23mm investigative costs, Siemens 1.5 million billable hours for FCPA investigations). After researching the trends, Chartis believes that it can insure the risk.</p>
<p>We will provide you updates on the form's coverage and expected costs as we work with clients to determine the costs and benefits of placing the product.</p>
<p>A copy of the specimen policy can be found by clicking <a href="http://www.iwpubs.com/ArticleManagement/ArticleManagementArticlePreview.asp?articleid=81558&amp;editionid=36309&amp;letterid=20662467&amp;memberid=2609155&amp;_g=70051E36EDC6492D8FD79FF83F0928DD&amp;_s=EA588F20">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Once an insurer is obliged to pay for the defense of&nbsp;a claim it initially failed to defend, may that insurer criticize the rates?&nbsp; Or how the defense counsel billed?&nbsp; Or the defense strategy?&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; If the insured is forced to defend itself, it would hardly be equitible for the insurer to&nbsp;&quot;Monday Morning Quarterback&quot;&nbsp;the selection of counsel, the billing format, even the litigation strategies.&nbsp; Inequity has not prevented such arguments from dilatory insurers, but the courts have looked askance at them.</p>
<p>A good 17 year ago in <em>Foxfire Inc v New Hampshire Insurance Company</em>, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9249, the memorandum opinion began by noting that an insurance company that wrongfully fails to defend may not later dispute litigation strategies undertaken by the defense in an action it refused to cover, citing to <em>Stalberg v. Western Title Ins. Co.</em>&nbsp; 230 Cal App 3d 1223,1233 (1991).&nbsp; Further, to allocate the insurer must produce undeniable evidence supporting the targetted expenses were solely&nbsp;incurred as&nbsp;to non covered claims.&nbsp; <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Barbara B.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; 4 Cal 4th, 1076, 1081 (1993).&nbsp; This is obviously a heavy burden rarely met.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the insurer's complaint that the rates were too high, the court noted &quot;Having forced its insured into the marketplace to retain counsel, NHICO cannot complain of paying marketplace rates...&quot; As to the insurer's complaint that the defense counsel spent too much time or spent time on unnecessary tasks, the court found &quot;NHICO lost any right to control Foxfire's litigation strategy ...the court will niether engage in a post hoc critique of Foxfire's litigation strategy nor allow NIHCO to do so.&quot;&nbsp; Indeed the standard of evidence insurers must produce to overcome the presumption that all the defense costs incurred were reasonable and necessary is high--&quot;that no reasonable defense attorney would have undertaken those services in defense of a client in such an action&quot;.&nbsp; <em>Firemen's Fund Ins. Co. v. Ex-Cell-O</em> 790 F Supp 1339, 1346 (E.

    <p>This is a story about how an insurer will go to any length to avoid coverage &ndash; and worse, how a court bought into that nonsense!</p>
<p>Lawyers are always trolling for clients; and it is a byword in the legal profession that there are occasional bad clients, and incidentally, that even the worst in our society are entitled to legal services.&nbsp; Thus, probably every lawyer has received emails from far away places, telling sob stories about how the writer has a thriving company but has significant outstanding accounts and wants to retain you to assist in their collection.</p>
<p>Probably, almost every lawyer has been alerted that these things are often scams and rip-offs; but how would you know that each and every such incoming message is a fraud?&nbsp; Lawyers know to press the delete button on such requests; but as people have learned to resist these come-ons, the writers have become more sophisticated, and nowadays these invitations often sound like the real thing:&nbsp; references, engagement letters, retainers are promised &ndash; the whole nine yards!&nbsp; I myself have looked twice and three times at some of the messages, thinking that a potentially legitimate foreign client should not be turned down simply because others have abused similar introductions.</p>
<p>Bad clients seem to be a part of a lawyer&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Thus, it is very surprising that a judge denied coverage for what seems to me a perfectly reasonable insurance claim arising in the lawyer&rsquo;s daily practice, on the ground that the person who had unquestionably scammed the lawyer in the sort of deal I just described was not a real client but someone who &ldquo;pretended to be [a] client.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>From 3000 miles away, here is an interesting insurance coverage decision.</p>
<p>Genzyme Corporation had issued several classes of &ldquo;tracking stocks&rdquo; which &ldquo;tracked&rdquo; the performance of various of its divisions, in that Genzyme tracked and announced the performance of the divisions, allocating corporate expenses to them in certain proportions.&nbsp; The market for the tracking stocks followed the divisions&rsquo; performance.&nbsp; Eventually Genzyme exchanged the tracking stocks for shares of its general common stock.&nbsp; Former holders of tracking stocks brought a class action claiming they had been defrauded in the acquisition because Genzyme had accounted unfairly for the profits of the division their stock had been tracking, thus shortchanging them in the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Does Public Policy Bar Coverage?</strong></p>
<p>That case settled and Genzyme then tried to recover a fraction of its costs for both defense and settlement from its sole D&amp;O carrier, whose coverage was only roughly 1/5 of Genzyme&rsquo;s total outlay.&nbsp; The trial court dismissed the case on the interesting ground that Genzyme had in effect stolen share value from its tracking shareholder class and that an insurance recovery for this outlay would be an indemnity for the insured&rsquo;s restoration of stolen property and thus contrary to public policy.</p>
<p>The First Circuit reversed, Genzyme Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co. (2010) 622 F. 3d 62.&nbsp; It first noted that Massachusetts &ldquo;recognizes only a limited public policy exception&rdquo; to the right to cover risks by insurance, &ldquo;only proscrib[ing] coverage of acts committed with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.&rdquo;&nbsp; That standard is more generous but not really very different from California&rsquo;s coverage limitations under Insurance Code section 533.&nbsp; The appeals court found that the case &ldquo;does not present an unjust enrichment situation&rdquo; because &ldquo;a corporation is neither benefited nor harmed by issuing additional shares of stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Genzyme thus plainly holds that D&amp;O coverage applies to transactions in the insured&rsquo;s own stock: an unusual fact situation and a strong point for broad interpretation of this insurance coverage.</p>

    <p>Over the last year I have repeatedly encountered the issue whether a policy of liability insurance is an asset of a bankrupt estate, and the teaser which follows that question, whether the payments under the policy are assets of the bankrupt estate. I found the issue both in lectures which I gave with one of my bankruptcy partners on the broader subject of insurance and bankruptcy, and in a specific case I became involved in. this blog seems a good opportunity to state my views on this somewhat recondite subject, without writing a brief or loading the point down with citations and close case analysis.&nbsp; I am mainly concerned about Chapter 11 bankruptcies.</p>
<p>The outcome should really be quite simple.</p>
<p>First, clearly an active, unexhausted liability policy must be an estate asset. I say, must be, for several reasons. First, it is an asset of value simply because the estate would be smaller or more at risk if it wasn&rsquo;t there, since it protects the estate against claims. And if the estate has debts, actual or potential, that might be covered by the policy or against which the policy might provide for defense, there again is an asset, and it has value. Certainly, a business that hopes to reorganize would want to tell its creditors that it has protection against past and current tort claims, which the insurance provides. So, despite arguments that any issues about the policy and its disposition are &ldquo;really&rdquo; between the insurer and the third party claimant, it is clear that the policy &ndash; the abstract contract to provide indemnity against claims &ndash; is indeed an asset of the bankrupt estate.</p>
<p>With respect to the policy proceeds the answer seems less clear, but it really shouldn&rsquo;t be. I think that it has been obscured both by carriers who want to get out from under coverage complexities and by third party claimants who fail to recognize that they cannot collect without going through the parity-protection process that lies at the heart of bankruptcy law.</p>

    <p>In 1998, the California Supreme Court turned sharply in favor of underwriters by holding that administrative orders which compelled an insured to engage in extensive, costly remediation were not covered by common CGL (Commercial General Liability) insurance policies.&nbsp; Rather, the court held 4:3, using standard dictionary definitions as its tools of analysis, that both defense and liability coverage could be triggered only by a &ldquo;suit in court,&rdquo; defined restrictively in a later case as one seeking money damages.&nbsp; The court expressly rejected the holdings of other states&rsquo; courts which required insurers to provide defense and indemnity for administrative remediation and similar proceedings, calling such reasoning &ldquo;functional&rdquo; or &ldquo;hybrid,&rdquo; although such proceedings were triggered by covered conduct (&ldquo;accidents&rdquo; or &ldquo;occurrences&rdquo;) and it was not the nature of the risk that differed but the method of enforcement by a third party claimant.&nbsp; <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>18 Cal. 4th 857.</p>
<p><em>Foster-Gardner</em> raised a firestorm, and eventually the Supreme Court retreated ever so slightly, allowing coverage where the policy language was a little weaker and included reimbursement of &ldquo;expenses.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>Powerine Oil Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2005)<em> </em>37 Cal. 4th 477.&nbsp; This month, the Court in effect, but not in words, reversed its position, finally getting in line with the rest of the country.&nbsp; It held on November 18, 2010, in <em>Ameron International Corporation v. Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania</em>, No. S153852, __ Cal. 4th ___, that administrative proceedings where a judicial officer (here, an Administrative Law Judge) presides and witnesses testify, is still a &ldquo;suit&rdquo; which the CGL insurer must defend and indemnify.</p>
<p>To save its self-esteem and avoid reversing <em>Foster-Gardner </em>outright, the Court reached that result by a tortuous course of logic whose keystone is that under the rules of the specific administrative tribunal at issue, a complaint &ldquo;requires no particular form or formality;&rdquo;&nbsp; the administrative board called the pleading which started the case a &ldquo;complaint;&rdquo; the work product looked like a complaint under the California Code of Civil Procedure even though the board involved was a federal one; and the aggrieved party had an option to bring suit or use the administrative process, although in enacting this process, Congress expressed its belief &ldquo;that agency boards would handle &lsquo;better than 90 percent of [such] contract claims.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In the insurance world, insurers have come up with a defense to a bad faith claim which they have called the&nbsp;&quot;genuine dispute&quot; rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;We suppose this differentiates it from an &quot;ungenuine dispute,&quot; which is a bad faith failure to pay policy benefits for no good reason.&nbsp; The &quot;genuine dispute&quot;&nbsp;defense to a bad faith claim&nbsp;was developed in the &quot;first party&quot; context -- those claims paid directly to the insured: a property loss, a&nbsp;disability or&nbsp;health insurance claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6221776020128302648&amp;q=Chateau+Chamberay+Homeowners+Association&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2004&amp;as_vis=1"><em>Chateau Chamberay Homeowners Ass'n v Associated Internet Ins. Co.</em> (2001) 90 Cal App. 4th 335, 347</a> was an example of &quot;bad facts' making 'bad law:'&quot; there the property loss was hotly disputed and a reasonable sum was paid by the insurer after a reasonable investigation, and the homeowners association sued anyway because they wanted more money&nbsp;and claimed bad faith.&nbsp; So the courts applied&nbsp;this new defense: &quot;genuine dispute&quot; to throw out the bad faith claim.&nbsp; There the insurer had done a reasonable investigation and reasonably calculated and paid the loss it determined was owed.&nbsp; Just because the insureds wanted more does not establish the insurer was in bad faith.</p>
<p>But as confirmed recently in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7558209370047510312&amp;q=Howard+v.+American+National+(2010)&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2004"><em>Howard v. American National </em>(2010) 187 Cal App 4th 498</a>, this rule does not apply&nbsp;in all contexts.&nbsp; Insurers are increasingly trying to use the &quot;genuine dispute&quot; shield in duty to defend third party cases involving liability policies.&nbsp; It doesn't fit.&nbsp; The rule is inconsistent with the duty to defend which arises wherever there is a mere potential for coverage.&nbsp; So if there is a dispute over whether an insurer should defend, they should defend.&nbsp; In <em>Howard,</em>&nbsp; the court rejected the insurer's use of this defense to a bad faith claim based on its&nbsp;refusal to settle a third party claim because a settlement decision must be made irregardless of coverage defenses.&nbsp; <em>Johansen v&nbsp;California State Auto Assn. &nbsp;(1975) </em>15 Cal 3d 9, 16.&nbsp; The insurer in <em>Howard,</em> American National, selectively&nbsp;read the claimant's deposition testimony -- ignoring the evidence establishing the damages&nbsp;did occur&nbsp;during the policy period.&nbsp;It unreasonably disclaimed coverage on the grounds that the damages occurred only later.</p>
<p>How about where an insurer refuses an indemnity payment on a liability policy?&nbsp; Courts have considered the &quot;genuine dispute&quot; defense in that context.&nbsp; But a &quot;genuine dispute&quot; exists only &quot;where the insurer's position is maintained in good faith and on reasonable grounds&quot; <em>Wilson v 21st Century Ins.

    <p>One of California&rsquo;s more pathbreaking rules is that an insurer must defend an entire suit if even one claim in that suit is potentially covered by a policy such as a CGL (commercial general liability) policy, but that when the case is over, the insurer may compel the insured to repay all defense costs not attributable to the covered claim. This is known as the <em>Buss</em> rule, after <em>Buss v. Superior Court</em> (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 35.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently decided unanimously that it can give the policyholder the same protection without following Buss&rsquo;s right to recover such defense costs from the insured, making the case that requiring a defense of the full range of claims brought against its insured is as much for the insurer&rsquo;s protection as for that of the insured. The court stated that &ldquo;a growing number of courts . . . have refused to follow the reasoning of Buss, and have not permitted an insurer to obtain reimbursement of defense costs of non-covered claims.&rdquo; According to these courts, said the Pennsylvania court, &ldquo;reimbursement is inconsistent with the broad duty to defend.&rdquo; <em>American and Foreign Ins. Co. v. Jerry&rsquo;s Sport Center, Inc.</em> (2010) 2 A. 3d 526. Unlike Buss, which saw the insurer&rsquo;s defense of non-potentially covered claims as imposed by law and public policy (16 Cal. 3d at 49), the Pennsylvania court found the insurer &ldquo;obligated [by the insurance contract] to defend its insured if the factual allegations of the complaint on its face encompass an injury that is actually or potentially within the scope of the policy.&rdquo; This decision was recently highlighted in <em>Insurance Litigation </em>as indicating a turn away from <em>Buss</em> around the nation.</p>
<p>The new majority rule (if it is that), which follows Justice Kennard&rsquo;s foresighted dissent in <em>Buss</em>, seems more attractive because it finds the insurer&rsquo;s <u>contractual</u> duties more comprehensive than is the case under <em>Buss</em>. That case expressly denied that the contractual duty to defend &ldquo;any suit&rdquo; involving a covered claim includes the defense of non-covered claims in the same suit. (P. 48.; see Kennard dissent at p. 64, noting the majority&rsquo;s silence on that issue.) It is the common wisdom that insurers&rsquo; coverage obligations are essentially derived from the insurance contract. Pennsylvania&rsquo;s interpretation of that contract provides a more protective conceptual basis than <em>Buss</em> for fulfilling the insured&rsquo;s reasonable expectations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;In a recent appellate opinion, <em>Arrowwood Indemnity v. Travelers </em>, published on October 6, 2010, the&nbsp;Second Appellate District once again affirmed the rule that an whenever the insurer &quot;ascertains facts which give rise to the potential of liability under the policy&quot; it <strong>must defend</strong>.&nbsp; This case was actually a contribution action where a defending insurer, Arrowood, sued the recalcitrant insurer, Travelers, who refused to defend the common insured, a contractor who was accused of failing to properly remediate dry rot at an apartment building.&nbsp; Ignoring the actual evidence available to it, Travelers claimed the damages&nbsp;happened after its policy.</p>
<p>In the underlying law suit, the injured party (owner of the building) did claim initially&nbsp;that the negligence was in 2002 and later (Arrowood's policy years), but introduced evidence at the trial of the insured's work going back to 2000 and problems dating from then (Travelers' policy years).&nbsp; The verdict form, in the underlying trial, asked general questions about liability and damages not tied to specific later dates mentioned in some of the earlier&nbsp;verdict questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was enough to tag Travelers.&nbsp; The court also determined that Arrowood need only make a <em>prima facie</em> showing of potential for coverage in the Travelers' year, which it easily did, and then it was up to Travelers to negate the potential.&nbsp;&nbsp; Impossible on these facts.&nbsp; The same relative burdens of proof would apply to an insured seeking coverage from a recalcitrant insurer.&nbsp; Good call.</p>

    <p>OK, so how many insurance coverage published opinions begin with &ldquo;What the Heck?!?&rdquo; Not too many (although given some of the arcane inverted logic that is sometimes in play one would expect a few more). The case of Essex Insurance Company v. Richard Heck, MD filed on July 29, 2010 (2010 DJAR 11835) does begin with this memorable phrase and serves as a warning to insurers as well as any other litigants who take contradictory positions in multiple simultaneous or seriatim lawsuits. There the Fifth Appellate District affirmed a summary judgment by a subrogee against an insurer&rsquo;s subrogation action, on the basis that the conduct of the insurer supported the trial court&rsquo;s determination that the insurer impliedly waived its subrogation rights. This was a case of first impression on this precise issue although the general concept of implied waiver was applied in an earlier case to an insured who impliedly waived his &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; claim when he accepted an insurer&rsquo;s settlement of the third party claim (in the absence of any evidence of coercion, duress or fraud). United Services Automobile Assn v. Alaska Ins. Co. (2001) 94 Cal App 4th 638.</p>
<p>Before reciting the facts of this twisted tale, we will summarize who was suing who and for what. The matter is complicated because of the rather tortured gyrations the insurer went through to avoid paying the eventual judgment against its insured. Initially the insurer did provide defense counsel for its insured, but it pursued a declaratory relief case against its insured at the same time the claimant&rsquo;s suit was pending. The insurer stubbornly refused to pay the judgment awarded to the claimant after trial. When cornered after the claimant brought fraud and bad faith claims, the insurer ultimately paid less that the claimant&rsquo;s judgment, but failed in its effort to pass that cost to a subrogee (a third party allegedly responsible for the injury to the claimant).<br />
<br />
The suits discussed in this opinion include: 1) the injured claimant&rsquo;s premises liability suit against the insured(s); 2) the insurer&rsquo;s declaratory relief suit against the insured(s); 3) the injured claimant&rsquo;s suit for bad faith and fraud against the insurer and finally 4) the insurer&rsquo;s suit against a third party (who was allegedly responsible for the claimant&rsquo;s injury).</p>

    <p>Defying common sense, an insurer who issued a commercial general liability insurance policy to a subcontractor refused to defend the contractor in a pre-litigation statutorily mandated settlement proceeding, known as the Calderon Process, which must precede all construction defect suits brought by planned unit development associations. StarNet Insurance Company&rsquo;s excuse was that the Calderon Process did not meet its policy definition of &ldquo;suit&rdquo; notwithstanding that the definition included not only &ldquo;a civil proceeding in which damages because of &hellip;property damage&hellip;are alleged.&rdquo; but also included: &ldquo;An arbitration proceeding&hellip;(and/or) Any other alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which such damages are claimed and to which the insured submits with our consent.&rdquo; Say what? <br />
<br />
This rather jaded approach to their policy allowed a Fourth Appellate District Court to begin their published opinion in Clarendon America Insurance Company v,. SarNet Insurance Company issued on July 27, 2010 (2010 DJAR 11645) with the coveted phrase: &ldquo;We hold, as a matter of first impression, the provision in a commercial general liability policy requiring the insurer to &ldquo;defend the insured against any &lsquo;suit&rsquo; seeking &hellip;damages&rdquo; to which the insurance applies includes the duty to defend the insured in proceedings under the Calderon Act&hellip;&rdquo; After noting the parties did not contend that definition no 2 (arbitration) applied as the Calderon Process was not an arbitration, the Appellate Court did not need to get to the third alternative definition of suit, (&ldquo;alternative dispute resolution proceeding&rdquo;), because a Calderon Process easily fits into the ambit of a &ldquo;civil proceeding in which damages&rdquo; are alleged. This is because, as the Court put it: &ldquo;The Calderon Process is more than a prelitigation dispute resolution requirement: It is part and parcel of construction or design defect litigation initiated by an association and, as such, cannot be divorced from a subsequent complaint.&rdquo; Thus this Court easily concluded that the parties to the StarNet policy intended that StarNet commercial general liability policy would have a duty to defend the insured in the Calderon Process.</p>

    <p>Lawyers who regularly deal with insurance coverage disputes are always tempted to parse the sometimes nearly unintelligible language of the insurance policy to determine whether and what kind of coverage exists.&nbsp; Indeed, courts can fall into that same temptation, e.g., Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. (1998) 18 Cal. 4th 857, holding that the term &ldquo;suit,&rdquo; which is what the insurer agreed to defend, must mean a suit in court and not an administrative enforcement action.</p>
<p>A new case is a refreshing reminder that courts do not always view policyholders&rsquo; rights so narrowly.&nbsp; In Lee v. Fidelity National Title Insurance Company (September 16, 2010), 10 DJDAR 14590, the trial court denied coverage to a title insurance holder.&nbsp; She had bought property which had been described in the escrow by metes and bounds and by assessor&rsquo;s plot numbers.&nbsp; Years later, a problem developed whether a neighbor&rsquo;s improvement was on the owner&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; It turned out that under the metes and bounds description, the improvement was on the neighbor&rsquo;s land although the assessor&rsquo;s plot numbers, erroneously, showed the property to be owned by the insured.&nbsp; The title company denied coverage, claiming that the metes and bounds description &ndash; which had just caused the insured to lose the property &ndash; defined the coverage under the policy language and controlled; and the trial court agreed.</p>
