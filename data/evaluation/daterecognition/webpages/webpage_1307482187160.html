			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Both houses of Congress now have to vote on the legislation, which is expected to occur this week. The President is expected to have the legislation to sign by the <span class="xn-chron">Independence Day</span> holiday. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Once the legislation is signed, that still really is just the beginning," said Hamilton. "Many of the provisions require the adoption of new regulations to fill in the detail of the legislative framework and create a mosaic of complete financial regulatory reform.'' </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Among the key provisions in the historic reform are:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Creation of Systemic Risk Regulator</b>: The legislation would enact an early warning system by creating a regulator to police systemically important firms. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Establish new Financial Stability Oversight Council</b>: This council, chaired by the Treasury Secretary and comprised of key regulators such as the Fed, SEC and CFTC, would monitor emerging risks to U.S. financial stability, recommend heightened prudential standards for large, interconnected financial companies and require nonbank financial companies to heightened supervision by the Federal Reserve if their failure would pose a risk to U.S. financial stability. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>New Office of Financial Research: </b>The legislation establishes an executive agency to collect and standardize data on financial firms and their activities to aid and support the work of the federal financial regulators with the data and analytic tools needed to prevent and contain future financial crises by developing tools for measuring and monitoring systemic risk. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Regulation of Derivatives</b>:<b> </b>The legislation would mandate, for the first time, the federal regulation of derivatives under a dual SEC-CFTC regime that emphasize transparency. The CFTC would regulate swaps and the SEC would regulate security-based swaps. The Act requires central clearing and exchange trading for derivatives that can be cleared and provides a role for both regulators and clearing houses to determine which contracts should be cleared. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Added power for PCAOB</b>: The Madoff fraud revealed that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board lacked the powers it needed to examine the auditors of broker-dealers. Thus, the legislation brings broker-dealers under the PCAOB oversight regime. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Investment Protections for Consumers and Investors</b>:<b> </b>This includes:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 							 								  									   <ul class="discStyle"  type="disc"><li><b>Financial literacy</b>: The legislation requires the SEC to conduct a financial literacy study and develop an investor financial literacy strategy intended to bring about positive behavioral change among investors</li><li><b>Creation of the Investor Advocate</b>:<b> </b>The legislation strengthens the ability of the SEC to better represent the interests of retail investors by creating an Investor Advocate tasked with assisting retail investors to resolve significant problems with the SEC or the self-regulatory organizations.</li><li><b>Greater disclosure to retail investors</b>: The legislation requires disclosures to retail investors prior to the sale of financial products and services. This provision will ensure that investors have the relevant and useful information they need when making decisions that determine their future financial condition.</li><li><b>More protection for underserved investors</b>: The legislation intends to increase access to mainstream financial institutions for the unbanked and the underbanked.</li></ul><br/>
								  								 
							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Reform of Securitization</b>: The legislation requires companies that sell products like mortgage-backed securities to retain a portion of the risk to ensure that they will not sell toxic securities to investors, because they have to keep some of it for themselves. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Resolution Authority</b>: The legislation's new orderly liquidation authority would allow the FDIC to safely unwind a failing nonbank financial firms or bank holding companies, an option that was not available during the financial crisis. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Corporate Governance</b>: &#160;The legislation gives shareholders a say on pay and proxy access, ensures the independence of compensation committees, and requires companies to set clawback policies to take back executive compensation based on inaccurate financial statements as important steps in helping shift management's focus from short-term profits to long-term growth and stability. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Hedging Rules</b>: The SEC is directed to adopt rules requiring a company to disclose whether any employee or director is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge the market value of equity securities granted to the employee or director as part of their compensation. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Executive Compensation Disclosure</b>: The SEC is required to amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to mandate disclosure of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, except the CEO; the annual total compensation of the CEO; and the ratio of the two. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Voting by Brokers</b>: Exchange rules must prohibit members that are not beneficial owners of a security from granting a proxy to vote the security in connection with a shareholder vote for the election of directors or executive compensation. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Hedge Fund and Private Equity Fund Advisers</b>: Hedge funds and private equity funds will have to register with the SEC and be subject to heightened disclosure. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Federal-State Regulation of Advisers</b>: The legislation raises the asset threshold above which investment advisers must register with the SEC from the <span class="xn-money">$25,000,000</span> set in 1996 by the National Securities Markets Improvement Act to <span class="xn-money">$100,000,000</span>. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Added Credit Rating Agencies Oversight</b>: The SEC will have a new office of credit ratings to regulate and promote accuracy in ratings, staffed with experts in structured, corporate and municipal debt finance. The legislation imposes tough new requirements on credit rating agencies. Rating agency boards are subject to new independence rules and rating analysts must be separated from those who sell the firm's services. </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Farm Aid joined family farmers from across the country today in <span class="xn-location">Madison, Wis.</span>, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) joint public workshop examining competition in the dairy industry. The workshop comes 18 months into an unprecedented crisis for dairy farmers. Low prices and high production costs, combined with a tightening credit market, have pushed thousands of family farmers out of business. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Farm Aid has always stood for keeping family farmers on the land in the face of increased concentration and consolidation in agriculture. But what is happening to dairy farmers &#8212; what has been allowed to happen for years &#8212; is unconscionable," said <span class="xn-person">Carolyn Mugar</span>, executive director of Farm Aid. "We are encouraged that just last week the Department of Agriculture proposed rules that will help level the playing field for livestock and poultry producers. Dairy farmers urgently need that same attention. Now is the time to act." </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Family farmers across the country are losing an average of <span class="xn-money">$100</span> a month on each dairy cow they own, with some farmers losing up to <span class="xn-money">$200</span> a month per cow. Meanwhile the largest dairy processors have made record profits. Lax enforcement of antitrust regulations has resulted in a system that creates artificially low prices for farmers and no savings for consumers. A 2006 investigation by a DOJ antitrust taskforce into dairy industry practices alleged anticompetitive conduct by dairy industry giants, such as Dean Foods and Dairy Farmers of America.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"I've waited 17 years for this opportunity. It is encouraging to see the USDA and DOJ finally taking interest in these issues that have disastrous effects on dairy farmers," said <span class="xn-location">Wisconsin</span> farmer <span class="xn-person">Joel Greeno</span>, one of the participants in the workshop's farmer panel. "Let's hope today is the beginning of the end of injustices in dairy markets. It is time to restore transparency and competitiveness so that farmers can make a fair living wage."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>On Thursday Farm Aid issued a call for signatures petitioning U.S. Attorney General <span class="xn-person">Eric Holder</span> to take immediate action to follow through on ongoing investigations of anticompetitive conduct by Dean Foods and Dairy Farmers of America. Additional antitrust allegations have been made against both firms in federal law suits. Since the beginning of 2009, Farm Aid has worked alongside the National Family Farm Coalition, Family Farm Defenders and other farmer organizations to call federal attention to this dairy crisis, advocating for dairy pricing reform and antitrust investigation. While farmers are encouraged by the joint DOJ and USDA workshops and recent antitrust lawsuits, there remains an urgent need to immediately establish a fair marketplace for dairy farmers.

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>For 25 years, Farm Aid has worked to build a vibrant, family farm-centered system of agriculture in America. Farm Aid artists and board members <span class="xn-person">Willie Nelson</span>, <span class="xn-person">Neil Young</span>, <span class="xn-person">John Mellencamp</span> and <span class="xn-person">Dave Matthews</span> host an annual concert to raise funds to support Farm Aid's work with family farmers and to inspire people to choose family farm food. Since 1985, Farm Aid has raised more than <span class="xn-money">$37 million</span> to support programs that help farmers thrive, expand the reach of the Good Food Movement, take action to change the dominant system of industrial agriculture and promote food from family farms. </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The following remarks by Assistant Attorney General <span class="xn-person">Christine Varney</span> were released today by the U.S. Department of Justice:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>It is a great pleasure to be here in <span class="xn-location">Madison, Wisconsin</span> to discuss the important issues facing the dairy industry today. Dairy farming has been a vital American industry since before there was an Antitrust Division, and we are here today to learn about the forces buffeting this important economic sector, and what the government might be able to do to help. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In these sessions, I have heard personally from so many farmers struggling to maintain a way of life their family &#8212; and this nation &#8212; has known for generations. American agriculture provides the livelihood for an enormous portion of the workforce, and sustenance for the rest. We should remember that American agriculture puts food on the table of American families, and that we have the ingenuity, productivity, and efficiency of its farmers to thank. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>This is the third session of these joint workshops which, from our perspective, have been and should continue to be a major success and an important example of government collaboration. We have been working closely with the United States Department of Agriculture, and based on what we have heard at prior workshops, we have recently formed a task force to examine how we can work better together to promote healthy competition in agriculture. One focus of this task force will be to review enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act, one of the nation's essential and historic competition laws. We have been gathering information, building in more time in each session to hear from farmers about the issues and industry dynamics that affect them the most. This is leading to a more fruitful understanding and more successful cooperation between our agencies than ever before.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Today is a particular highlight for us. Our discussions and panels today bring together officials not only from the Department of Justice and the Department of Agriculture, but also from Congress, from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and from the states, all of whom have a strong interest in the vibrancy and competitiveness of dairy markets. These diverse panels of farmers, academics, and industry representatives will be discussing the important trends affecting the industry, the prevalence and increase in concentration in the market for raw milk, and issues surrounding the way in which prices to dairy farmers are set. We expect that what we learn today will help us immeasurably as we consider the ways in which government can help to ensure efficiency and competition in dairy markets, with low prices to consumers &#8212; from schoolchildren to family pizza shops &#8212; and with fair returns to those running our dairy farms. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>We have already taken some important steps to protect consumers from undue consolidation. In January, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Dean Foods alleging that it violated the antitrust laws in its acquisition of Foremost Farms. As we said in our complaint, we believe that transaction will likely lead to higher milk prices for both schoolchildren and everyday fluid milk consumers here in <span class="xn-location">Wisconsin</span>, as well as <span class="xn-location">Michigan</span> and <span class="xn-location">Illinois</span>. I have traveled with Senators Leahy and Schumer to <span class="xn-location">Vermont</span> and <span class="xn-location">New York</span> to speak with dairy farmers, and we are keeping a watchful eye on this industry, mindful of the various comments that we have heard. We know that dairy farmers are concerned about a lack of choices for buyers, about the way that their milk is priced, and about a year of dispiriting returns for their labors. It is my hope that today's conversations will allow us to bring attention and clarity to these issues, and help us to think hard about the role that the Department of Justice and the Department of Agriculture can play in promoting the health and competitiveness of dairy markets in these economic times. </p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The 33,000-member ISBA, with offices both in <span class="xn-location">Springfield</span> and <span class="xn-location">Chicago, Ill.</span>, provides professional services to <span class="xn-location">Illinois</span> lawyers, and education and services to the public.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Hassakis will make "Lawyers Care" the overarching theme of his presidency, honoring the extraordinary efforts that ISBA lawyers and judges make every day to serve their communities. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In addition, he will place a special emphasis on juvenile justice reform and the role that lawyers and judges are playing to make needed improvements in the system. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"We must do something about the epidemic of juvenile crime and the seeming lack of an approach to successfully re-directing many youth who are convicted," he says. "By putting an emphasis on community-based alternatives, we can stop wasting the state's limited financial resources on approaches that do not work, like incarceration, for these low and moderate offenses."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Working with the leaders of Illinois Models for Change, an initiative funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to help reform the juvenile justice system in <span class="xn-location">Illinois</span>, Hassakis and the ISBA will cast a spotlight on several successful model programs in <span class="xn-location">Illinois</span> that can serve as an impetus for other communities to make changes.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Looking ahead to the next generation of lawyers and bar leaders, Hassakis will identify as "Rising Stars" ISBA members admitted to the bar for less than five years who have already made noteworthy contributions to the practice of law.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Hassakis, who concentrates his law practice in injury and wrongful death cases, will be the first Greek American to serve as ISBA president. &#160;In 2002, he was elected to the Board of Governors, the ISBA's 25-member supreme governing body. &#160;He was elected ISBA third vice president in <span class="xn-chron">May 2007</span> and has moved up the organizational ladder, currently serving as president-elect. &#160;He is a past president of the Illinois Bar Foundation, charitable and educational arm of ISBA, and the Jefferson County Bar Association.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Hassakis &amp; Hassakis, P.C., began in 1950 as a firm established by Mark's father, <span class="xn-person">Demetri Hassakis</span>, to engage in a full-service practice that was typical back then. &#160;Over time, the practice evolved into what it has become today: a distinguished boutique injury law firm.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Community activities have played an important part in Hassakis' life, including service on the board of the Downtown Mt. Vernon Development Corporation. &#160;He and his wife Janet served as co-presidents of the Jefferson County Heart Association, and both are active members and sponsors of Cedarhurst, a nationally-recognized local art museum and sculpture park.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>He and Janet have a daughter, Hallie, 28, who holds a masters degree in International Relations and works for the federal government in <span class="xn-location">Washington, D.C.</span> &#160;A son, <span class="xn-person">Mark Denny</span>, was born in 1984 and passed away on <span class="xn-chron">August 10, 2007</span>. &#160; </p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Naaman also admitted that from 2004 to 2008, he paid and promised to pay more than <span class="xn-money">$3 million</span> in bribes, in the form of cash, as well as travel, gifts and entertainment, to officials of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and the Trade Bank of <span class="xn-location">Iraq</span> to secure sales of tetraethyl lead in <span class="xn-location">Iraq</span>, as well as to secure more favorable exchange rates on the contracts.&#160; Naaman provided Innospec with false invoices to support the payments, and those invoices were incorporated into the books and records of Innospec.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Naaman faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.&#160; His sentencing has not yet been scheduled.</p>

On <span class="xn-chron">May 24, 2010</span>, the Company had announced that it had secured a backstop commitment from certain unsecured noteholders for a rights offering of up to <span class="xn-money">$500 million</span>. In this rights offering, AbitibiBowater would offer new convertible notes with a seven-year maturity from the date of closing to eligible unsecured creditors. Upon the effective date of the plan, the notes would be obtained upon exercise of the rights and convertible into common stock of the emerged company. Additional information on this rights offering has been disclosed in the Company's court filings, which are available at <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='97185744';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.abitibibowater.com/restructuring">www.abitibibowater.com/restructuring</a>.</p>

Paterson</span>, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The Company expects to emerge with a significantly improved financial position, resulting from its efforts to reduce costs, lower debt and mitigate the impact of ongoing market and currency fluctuations."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Before emerging from creditor protection, the Company must obtain adequate exit financing and complete efforts to address labor costs and pension issues, as well as satisfy other conditions set forth in the plans of reorganization. AbitibiBowater has commenced a process to obtain an exit financing package that will provide sufficient capital for the emerged company to manage business operations and execute its plans.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Ultimately, the Company's plans of reorganization will require creditor approval and confirmation by the courts. Affected unsecured creditors who are entitled to vote will receive the court-approved disclosure and voting materials, which are expected to be mailed in July subject to court approvals.

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"On <span class="xn-chron">June 23, 2010</span>, the Wayne County Circuit Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the Woodhaven-Brownstown School District from terminating many of its employees and replacing them with private contractors," stated Garrett. &#160;"The school district sought to eliminate all transportation employees, including bus drivers and mechanics, custodians and maintenance employees. &#160;All of these employees would be replaced with contract employees.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"To allow for fair and competitive bidding to save school districts money, the legislature passed amendments to <span class="xn-location">Michigan</span>'s labor law to permit school district employee unions to bid on an equal basis as other bidders for their jobs," continued Garrett. &#160;"If the school district does not provide this opportunity to bid, it must bargain with the union about privatization.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"The complaint filed in court alleges that Woodhaven-Brownstown School District issued a Request for Proposals that only permitted contractors to bid," Garrett explained. &#160;"There was no provision which allowed the employees to bid in any way. &#160;After the union demanded to bargain over all issues related to subcontracting, the employer refused to bargain.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"At the same time, the school district told the employees that to prevent the loss of their jobs; they would need to come up with <span class="xn-money">$400,000</span> in concessions," Garrett pointed out. &#160;"The union submitted a proposal that would save the school district roughly <span class="xn-money">$425,000</span>. &#160;The next day, the school district rejected the proposal and stated that it needed <span class="xn-money">$900,000</span> in concessions.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Michigan AFSCME Council 25 filed an unfair labor practice alleging that it was not provided an opportunity to bid on an equal basis and the employer refused to bargain regarding privatization," added Garrett. &#160;"The union also alleged that the school district bargained in bad faith when the union met the district's target for concessions and the school district reacted by more than doubling the target then terminating all of the employees.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"AFSCME also sought injunctive relief to avoid a meaningless decision regarding the unfair labor practice; whether the school district has an obligation to bargain with the union regarding privatization is moot if the jobs are already privatized," Garrett asserted. &#160;"Judge <span class="xn-person">Michael Sapala</span> of the Wayne County Circuit Court issued a temporary restraining order halting the privatization."</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Dot Hill Systems Corp. (Nasdaq: <a href='http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&Ticker=HILL' target='_blank' title='HILL'>HILL</a>), a provider of world-class storage solutions and software for OEMs, open storage partners and system integrators, today announced the addition of two new patents to the company's technology portfolio, bringing the company's portfolio to a total of 67 patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The first of the two most recently granted patents improves reliability and usability for storage controllers and data storage systems. Storage controllers contain the control logic that performs commands for overall management of device operations.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>U.S. patent 7,743,224 "Method and apparatus for virtual load regions in storage system controllers" provides a novel method for managing storage controller code, where two different versions of code are stored in storage controller memory. The code identifiers designate which of the two code versions is to be a primary version, which the storage controller will initially attempt to boot.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>If any problems are encountered in booting or operating with the primary version of code, the controller first stops execution of the failing code, second, switches to the other version of storage controller code, and third, initiates a boot sequence from the other version of code. This invention is helpful for allowing a controller to successfully boot if a version of code is either corrupted or has other problems. Therefore, a test or experimental version of code can be loaded into a storage controller. If the test or experimental version of code cannot boot, the controller will automatically select an older stable version of code and successfully boot.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The second patent granted covers technology that helps improve the overall management experience for storage administrators, by reducing repetitive extraneous information relayed by storage system controllers, improving available network bandwidth and reducing clutter at the user interface.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>U.S. patent 7,743,138 "Method and apparatus for external event notification management over in-band and out-of-band networks in storage system controllers" provides a method for notifying a user of events involving the data storage system. Storage controllers in the data storage system maintain subscription statistics for each user of the data storage system, where the subscription statistics describe which informational, error, and other events the user wishes to be notified of. The data storage system also keeps track of which events have already been reported to a requesting user, so that the same events are not reported to the same user multiple times.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"To meet the needs of today's 'always on' business world, data storage has changed radically; technology innovation is essential to driving greater levels of functionality, ease of use, capacity and throughput," said <span class="xn-person">Jim Kuenzel</span>, senior vice president of engineering at Dot Hill Systems. "These new patents are further testament to Dot Hill's technology innovation and to the depth and breadth of our technical talent, which is unmatched across the storage industry."</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), with the cooperation of seven firms, is announcing voluntary recalls of more than two million cribs to address drop-side hazards and other hazards that affect the safety of young children. &#160;The recalling firms are providing consumers with free repair kits to immobilize the drop-sides or other remedies. &#160;<b>Do not attempt to fix these cribs with homemade remedies.</b></p>

Consumers should contact these firms directly for the appropriate remedy: &#160;</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Cribs should be the safest place in the home for infants and toddlers," said CPSC Chairman <span class="xn-person">Inez Tenenbaum</span>. "CPSC is committed to addressing the hazards with cribs and to restoring parents' confidence that their child will have a safe sleep." </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>CPSC continues to actively investigate various cribs for potential drop-side and other hazards as part of a larger effort by the agency to rid the marketplace and homes of unsafe cribs. CPSC staff is also working on a new mandatory standard to make cribs safer, which will be finalized in 2010. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA) has also launched a new crib safety initiative. The industry group is providing free drop-side crib immobilization kits to prevent the drop-side from detaching, plus replacement hardware and assembly instructions for cribs manufactured by participating firms. These materials are available free to any consumer by request.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The firms involved in today's recalls are providing immobilization devices or other remedies as part of JPMA's crib safety initiative. Consumers can visit JPMA's website, <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='97054184';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.cribsafety.org/">www.cribsafety.org</a>, for a list of participating manufacturers and for downloadable materials about ensuring that children have a safe sleep. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The immobilization devices, which will be available in the next few weeks, should be attached to keep the drop-side from detaching from the cribs. Immobilization devices are not a solution for cribs with broken or damaged drop-side hardware. If your drop-side hardware is broken, contact the manufacturer for an alternative remedy.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>CPSC issued a warning last month [LINK to 10-225] alerting parents and caregivers that there can be deadly hazards associated with drop-side cribs. Nine million drop-side cribs have been recalled over the past five years. CPSC staff has determined drop-side cribs generally have a tendency to be less structurally sound than cribs with four fixed sides. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Drop-side crib incidents can also occur due to incorrect assembly or age-related wear and tear. &#160;Age is a factor in the safety of any crib. At a minimum, CPSC staff recommends that you not use a crib that is older than 10 years. Many older cribs do not meet current voluntary standards and can have numerous safety problems.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>Important Message from CPSC:</b></p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The safest place for your baby to sleep is in a crib or bassinet, depending on their age. &#160;If your crib has been recalled or it has missing, broken or loose parts, find an alternate safe sleep environment intended for a baby. If your baby is less than six months old and is not yet able to push up to his/her hands and knees, you can put your baby to sleep in a bassinet. Make sure your bassinet has not been recalled. <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='97054184';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cgi-bin/bassinets.aspx">Here's a list</a>. Also, you can use a play yard. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Do not put additional bedding such as pillows, thick quilts, comforters or anything plush into your baby's sleeping space. More babies die every year from suffocation in plush sleeping environments than from defective cribs. Always place your baby on his or her back to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</p>

CPSC's work to ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters, and household chemicals &#8211; contributed significantly to the decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 30 years.</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The state of <span class="xn-location">Florida</span> must provide <span class="xn-person">Michele Haddad</span> with services that will enable her to remain in her home, a U.S. District Court in <span class="xn-location">Jacksonville, Fla.</span>, ruled Wednesday. Haddad, who has quadriplegia as a result of a motorcycle accident with a drunk driver in 2007, has successfully resided in the community since the accident, but is at risk of entry into a nursing home due to changes in her caregiver situation. Haddad, who has been on the waiting list for Medicaid community-based waiver services for two years, notified the state of her increased need for services, but was told that community services would only be available if she was willing to enter a nursing home for 60 days. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The court ordered the state to provide community-based services as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA) integration mandate as set forth in<i> Olmstead v. L.C</i>. <span class="xn-location">The United States</span> argued in a brief filed on <span class="xn-chron">May 25, 2010</span>, that Haddad would suffer irreparable harm if forced to enter a nursing home to receive necessary services.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The court issued this order in the week that marks the 11th anniversary of the landmark<i> Olmstead</i> decision. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"In the<i> Olmstead</i> case, the court recognized that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities stigmatizes those individuals as unworthy of participation in community life," said <span class="xn-person">Thomas E. Perez</span>, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "By supporting Ms. Haddad in this case, we seek to ensure that individuals with disabilities can receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate, where they can participate in their communities, interact with individuals who do not have disabilities, and make their own day to day choices."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The U.S. government's participation in this case is part of the administration's efforts across the nation to affirm the fundamental right for Americans with disabilities to live independently, in what the president has deemed "The Year of Community Living."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The full and fair enforcement of the ADA and its mandate to integrate individuals with disabilities is a major priority of the Civil Rights Division. The ADA protects individuals with disabilities from discrimination by public entities. People interested in finding out more about the ADA can call the Justice Department's toll-free ADA Information Line at 1-800-514-0301 or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY), or access its ADA website at <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='97095219';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.ada.gov/">www.ada.gov/</a>. </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Civil rights attorney <span class="xn-person">Waukeen McCoy</span> received a favorable ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this week, reversing Judge <span class="xn-person">Susan Illston</span>'s sanctions because the District Court violated his constitutional right to due process of law.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In 2007, after a 5-year fight with FedEx, McCoy's clients - <span class="xn-person">Edward Alvarado</span>, <span class="xn-person">Pernell Evans</span> and <span class="xn-person">Charlotte Boswell</span> - received jury awards in the amount of <span class="xn-money">$500,000</span>, <span class="xn-money">$975,000</span>, and <span class="xn-money">$3,000,000</span> respectively. &#160;Also in 2007, McCoy achieved a <span class="xn-money">$55 million</span> settlement in a class action law suit against FedEx. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In <span class="xn-chron">December 2009</span>, Judge <span class="xn-person">Susan Illston</span>, sanctioned McCoy <span class="xn-money">$25,000</span> because she alleged "Mr. McCoy attempted to avoid rigorous scrutiny of his reported hours," claiming that McCoy submitted false time records for statutory attorney's fees. &#160;<u>Alvarado et al v. FedEx</u> (3:04-cv-00098-SI)</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>However, on <span class="xn-chron">June 17, 2010</span>, the Ninth Circuit reversed Illston's sanctions with prejudice and remanded the case back to the District Court, handing down an additional blow to FedEx. &#160;The Court found that the sanctions imposed by Judge Ilston were "criminal in nature" because they were "intended to punish McCoy for his conduct and to vindicate the court's authority and integrity of the judicial process, not to compensate FedEx for losses sustained or to coerce McCoy into compliance with a court order."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>A point of contention in the matter was whether McCoy filed false declarations of his time records, which are used in the Court's assessment of attorney's fees. &#160;According to McCoy, it would have been impossible to submit contemporaneous time records for the three prevailing parties - Alvarado, Evans and Boswell &#8211; because the matter originated as a multi-plaintiff case in which McCoy represented 24 FedEx employees. &#160;The majority of McCoy's legal preparation was for the group benefit as a whole rather than one plaintiff in particular. &#160;At no time did McCoy attempt to mislead the Court by claiming that he kept contemporaneous time records. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>When one party files false declarations, the opposing party may file a Rule 11 motion to request that the Judge impose sanctions. &#160;To challenge McCoy's time records filing, FedEx ignored this established remedy, which would have allowed McCoy to respond or correct the problem. Instead FedEx filed an Inherent Powers motion which allowed Judge Ilston to bypass the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to impose sanctions and deny McCoy his due process. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>McCoy avers that Judge Ilston maintains a personal vendetta against him. &#160;Despite lacking customary justifications for choosing to seal documents, Ilston selectively sealed only documents related to the payments of attorneys' fees and the amount of money the class representatives received in <u>Satchell</u>, a related case.  McCoy calls for more transparency in the Court's records so that the public can witness the District Court's abuse of power. &#160;</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Corgenix Medical Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: CONX), a worldwide developer and marketer of diagnostic test kits, announced today the issuance of one new European patent for the company's AtherOx&#174; (oxLDL/B2GPI) technology and the publication of an important clinical trial studying oxLDL/B2GPI levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"We are very pleased to announce these two very important accomplishments," said <span class="xn-person">Douglass Simpson</span>, President and CEO of Corgenix. "The newest patent expands our IP portfolio, and the acute coronary syndrome clinical trial reported remarkable results. Since cardiovascular disease is one of the world's leading causes of death, the early detection of atherosclerosis has become increasingly important, and we are optimistic about the ability of AtherOx to address this significant market."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The clinical trial was conducted at Saint Mary's Hospital in <span class="xn-location">Waterbury, Conn.</span>, under the leadership of <span class="xn-person">Thomas P. Greco</span>, M.D.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>European patent # EP 1 596 198 B, <i>"Method of Measuring Oxidized LDL-Beta2-GP1-CRP Complex"</i> was issued <span class="xn-chron">April 7, 2010</span>. The patent is a method patent providing additional European protection to the components and assay procedure used to measure AtherOx complexes in biological samples. The latest patent adds to previous issued U.S. and European patents. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The clinical study, "<i>Oxidized-LDL/B2-Glycoprotein I Complexes Are Associated With Disease Severity and Increased Risk for Adverse Outcomes in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes,</i>" was published in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Pathology</i>, 2010; 133:737-743. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Our study showed that patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) had significantly higher mean levels of Oxidized-LDL/B2-Glycoprotein I (AtherOx) complexes," said Dr. Greco, principal investigator and lead author.

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>EarthLink believes the transaction would result in Comcast engaging in a range of anti-competitive actions that will reduce consumer choice, restrict content diversity, and interfere with Internet competition. &#160;To remedy these harms, EarthLink proposed the FCC adopt a condition requiring Comcast to offer wholesale standalone broadband access to independent Internet service providers. &#160;EarthLink's successful and long-standing wholesale relationship with Time Warner Cable demonstrates that merger conditions implementing competitive broadband access can enhance consumer choice and create commercial benefits for all parties. &#160;</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Good morning. Thank you, <span class="xn-person">Chris [Hook]</span>, for your kind words and for all the work that you, <span class="xn-person">Marc [Salans]</span>, the Board of DOJ Pride and our EEO staff team have done in organizing today's ceremony. It's a pleasure to join <span class="xn-person">Tom [Perez]</span> in welcoming so many members of the Justice Department family, and so many distinguished guests, here today as we commemorate LGBT Pride Month. I'm glad that Senator [<span class="xn-person">Amy] Klobuchar</span> and Director [<span class="xn-person">John] Clark</span> are with us. And I want to congratulate <span class="xn-person">Chris [Hook]</span> and this year's other award recipients, Councilmember [<span class="xn-person">David] Catania</span> and Attorney General [<span class="xn-person">Doug] Gansler</span>, on their achievements and contributions. I also want to thank our keynote speakers &#8211; <span class="xn-person">Jenny Durkan</span><b>,</b> U.S. Attorney for the Western District of <span class="xn-location">Washington</span>, and <span class="xn-person">Sharon Lubinski</span><b>,</b> U.S. Marshal for the District of <span class="xn-location">Minnesota</span> &#8211; for sharing their thoughts and stories with us and for providing an example of service for us all.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>We have much to celebrate today. In the year since we last gathered, our nation &#8211; and the Justice Department &#8211; have taken steps to address some of the unique challenges faced by members of our country's LGBT community. As you all know, up until last fall, there was not a single line in the nearly 225-year history of the U.S. Code that referred explicitly to gender identity. Today, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act &#8211; which the President signed into law last October &#8211; does just that, finally protecting our nation's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered individuals from the most brutal forms of bias-motivated violence.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In another important development, in April of this year, the Justice Department concluded that the Violence Against Women Act covers, and more importantly protects, same sex partners. And, just several weeks ago, as part of the department's, and the Administration's, commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion, I announced a new Diversity Management Plan and the appointment of <span class="xn-person">Channing Phillips</span> as Deputy Associate Attorney General for Diversity. With this initiative, and with Channing's leadership, we're working to ensure that the Department can effectively recruit, hire, retain, and develop a workforce that reflects our nation's rich diversity, a Department that welcomes and encourages the contributions of its LGBT employees.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>I'm grateful for the assistance and guidance that so many of you have given. Our progress would not have been possible without your contributions. And while we have meaningful achievements to celebrate today, we must remember how much more work we have to do to transform today's opportunities into tomorrow's successes. Too many of the challenges that confronted the LGBT community 16 years ago &#8211; when DOJ Pride was founded &#8211; confront us still today. Too many of the same obstacles that existed then remain for us to overcome. Too many talented men and women cannot, in the words of this year's motto, "serve openly, with pride."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>With your help and engagement, we're working to ensure that the Justice Department lives up to its responsibility to provide a work environment where every employee is respected and given an equal opportunity to thrive. That's the goal we share and the achievement we'll keep working toward - together.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Thank you. </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The <span class="xn-location">Iowa</span> chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-IA) today called on local state and national law enforcement agencies to investigate an allegedly bias-motivated attack on an Iowa Muslim as a possible hate crime.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>CAIR-IA said an 18-year-old Iraqi refugee and his mother were reportedly assaulted following a recent softball game at <span class="xn-location">Cedar Rapids</span>' Tait Cummings Park by a member of the opposing team. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>During the game, supporters of the opposing team allegedly shouted racial slurs at the victim and his team members. After the game, the victim was allegedly hit in the jaw by an assailant from the opposing team who shouted slurs such as "raghead," "terrorist" and "camel jockey." The victim's jaw was broken in the alleged assault. The victim's mother was allegedly assaulted by the same person when she tried to defend her son. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>[Other players on the victim's team, who are members of minority groups, were also allegedly called "n**ger" and "spic."]</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>No arrests were made at the time of the incident, but CAIR-IA has since worked with a representative of the <span class="xn-location">Linn County</span> attorney's office to have a warrant issued for the alleged attacker.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Hate crime charges are appropriate whenever evidence indicates that an attack was motivated by bias," said CAIR-IA Executive Director <span class="xn-person">Miriam Amer</span>. "Law enforcement authorities should bring the alleged perpetrator to justice and community leaders should speak out against the intolerance that leads to such incidents."</p>

		<div class="asset-content entry-content">
		<div id="googlepic"></div>
	        <div class="asset-body"> The Supreme Court of <span class="xn-location">the United States</span> has handed down an opinion in the case of <i>New Process Steel, L.P. v. National Labor Relations Board </i>(NLRB) that resulted in a significant victory for&#160;Greenberg Traurig client, New Process Steel.&#160;<b> </b>The Supreme Court's decision reversing the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has the potential to overturn approximately 600 cases previously decided by the&#160;NLRB over a two-year-period. Attorneys from Greenberg Traurig's <span class="xn-location">Atlanta</span>, <span class="xn-location">Boston</span> and <span class="xn-location">Washington D.C.</span> offices worked together and with attorneys from Richie &amp; Gueringer P.C. to obtain the victory for New Process Steel. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"This is a tremendous ruling for New Process Steel and demonstrates that justice truly can be had by all," said <span class="xn-person">David Long-Daniels</span>, Shareholder, Greenberg Traurig's <span class="xn-location">Atlanta</span> office. &#160;"We are pleased by the United States Supreme Court's decision protecting the rights of our client, as well as our client's employees." </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The case came about when the union representing employees at the New Process Steel plant in <span class="xn-location">Butler, Indiana</span>, failed to reach an agreement over a new contract with New Process Steel, L.P. &#160;The union wanted to cut the employees' pay, vacation and benefits in order to obtain the contract. After the employees rejected the contract and also declined to strike, the union insisted that the employees' vote against the strike amounted to ratification. Subsequently, the union filed unfair labor practices claims with the NLRB claiming that New Process Steel failed to honor its collective bargaining agreement to deal with the union as the exclusive representative of the plant's employees. New Process Steel disagreed and opposed the union in order to ensure the employees' pay and benefits were not take away. &#160;While a two-member panel of the NLRB agreed with the union, the Supreme Court of <span class="xn-location">the United States</span> ultimately ruled that NLRB's decision was invalid because 29 U.S.C. Section 153(b) of the National Labor Relations Act requires that three members of the five member National Labor Relations Board shall "at all times" constitute a quorum.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In addition to Long-Daniels, the Greenberg Traurig team included: <span class="xn-person">Todd Wozniak</span>, a trial lawyer who defends companies and public institutions throughout the U.S. in labor and employment, also in the firm's <span class="xn-location">Atlanta</span> office; Labor and Employment Practice shareholder <span class="xn-person">Joe Ambash</span> and associate <span class="xn-person">Justin Keith</span>, of the Greenberg Traurig Boston office; and in <span class="xn-location">Washington, D.C.</span>, Mark Solomons,&#160;co-chair&#160;of Greenberg Traurig's National Appellate Practice Group, and <span class="xn-person">Laura Klaus</span>, co-managing shareholder of that office. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Greenberg Traurig attorneys worked with <span class="xn-person">Sheldon (Don) Richie</span>, who argued the case before the Supreme Court, <span class="xn-person">Gay Gueringer</span> and <span class="xn-person">Katherine Walters</span>, all with Richie &amp; Gueringer P.C., which has offices in <span class="xn-location">Austin</span> and <span class="xn-location">San Antonio, Texas</span>. &#160;</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> On <span class="xn-chron">May 24, 2010</span>, Biwater
Investments Ltd (Biwater) filed a Petition in the <span class="xn-location">Amsterdam</span> Court for an
inquiry to be conducted into the policy and course of affairs at Cascal
N.V.(NYSE: HOO)(Cascal), limited to Cascal's acts and deeds in relation to
Biwater's proposed sale of its stake in Cascal to Sembcorp and the Voluntary
Tender Offer (VTO) for the period commencing mid-2009. On <span class="xn-chron">May 28, 2010</span>,
Biwater filed a supplemental application for an order to restrain Cascal from
issuing new shares to frustrate the VTO.</p>


							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>    On <span class="xn-chron">June 2, 2010</span>, Cascal filed its defence to Biwater's petition seeking to
deny Biwater's requests for the restraining order and to seek interim relief
in the form of an order for the temporary transfer of Biwater's shares in
Cascal to a person to be appointed by the <span class="xn-location">Amsterdam</span> Court for the purposes of
the proposed transaction with Sembcorp or alternatively, an order to suspend
Biwater's voting rights or in the further alternative, an order to forbid
Biwater from tendering its shares in the VTO. On <span class="xn-chron">June 6, 2010</span>, Sembcorp joined
the petition as an interested party.</p>


							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>    On <span class="xn-chron">June 16, 2010</span>, the Court rendered its decision: the Court found in
favour of Biwater and Sembcorp on all counts and rejected all of Cascal's
requests for interim relief. However, as Cascal's lawyers told the Court that
no issuance of shares to frustrate the VTO would be made if the Court should
find against Cascal, the Court made no restraining order to that effect.</p>


							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>    Sembcorp is pleased that the <span class="xn-location">Amsterdam</span> Court has rendered its judgment in
favour of Biwater and Sembcorp. This follows the denial of a Cascal motion by
the United States District Court for the Southern District of <span class="xn-location">New York</span> last
month. Sembcorp has always held the view that it is not in breach of any laws,
regulations or contractual obligations in relation to the transaction, and

Rauh, Jr. Lecture</a><div style="font-weight:lighter;color:#696969;font-size: 12px;font-style:italic;">June 20, 2010</div></h2></div>
		<div class="asset-content entry-content">
		<div id="googlepic"></div>
	        <div class="asset-body"> The following remarks as prepared for delivery by Attorney General <span class="xn-person">Eric Holder</span> were released today by the U.S. Department of Justice:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Thank you, <span class="xn-person">Wade [Henderson]</span>. &#160;It's an honor to join you and to thank you for your leadership and service here at UDC and across this city. &#160;Not only is Wade a great professor, he is also an outstanding ambassador for the David A. Clarke School of Law. &#160;And he never misses an opportunity to champion this school's unique and provocative approach to legal education. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Of course, much of the credit goes to <span class="xn-person">Dean Broderick</span> and her team of administrators, faculty, and staff. &#160;I want to thank you all for inviting me to join you today. &#160;I'm especially grateful for the chance to commend the Clarke Law School's extraordinary example of excellence, service, and innovation &#8211; an example that inspires the legal community in this city and far beyond.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Tonight also provides a rare and welcome opportunity to do something every attorney, and certainly any Attorney General, regularly should &#8211; to reflect on the systemic challenges facing our justice system and to consider the future of legal education in this country. &#160;In the spirit of <span class="xn-person">Joseph Rauh</span>, the visionary namesake of this lecture series, that's exactly what tonight is all about: taking a step back from what we do and what we study to consider what we owe &#8211; to our country and to our community.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Now, where do we begin? &#160;To me, it seems appropriate to start by thinking about the one event that's on a lot of our minds right now &#8211; the World Cup. &#160;I know that many of you have already cleared your schedules for <span class="xn-chron">10am tomorrow</span>, when the U.S. takes on <span class="xn-location">Slovenia</span>. &#160;But more importantly we should also take time to think about where this historic game will be played.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>As all of you know, and some remember well, <span class="xn-location">South Africa</span> was &#8211; at one time &#8211; &#160;the last place on Earth where you could imagine people of all cultures coming together. &#160;In the era of Apartheid, <span class="xn-location">South Africa</span>'s laws supported a system, not of justice but of injustice. &#160;Its legal framework enshrined bigotry, enforced discrimination, and spread hate from <span class="xn-location">Cape Town</span> to <span class="xn-location">Johannesburg</span> to <span class="xn-person">Robben Island</span>. &#160;This system of oppression enraged citizens within and beyond <span class="xn-location">South Africa</span>. &#160;It also motivated American law students like me, who spent a lot of time away from our studies to call for reform from half way across the world.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>For my most famous predecessor, Attorney General <span class="xn-person">Robert F. Kennedy</span>, the laws of Apartheid, and of any system of segregation, were particularly offensive. &#160;In fact, forty-four years ago this month, he traveled to <span class="xn-location">South Africa</span> to deliver a speech at the University of <span class="xn-location">Cape Town</span> &#8211; just minutes from the stadium where many World Cup games are being played. &#160;In his now-famous "Day of Affirmation" address, Attorney General Kennedy spoke about the right to justice, the power of action, and the possibilities born from hope. &#160;As he said to all those listening in <span class="xn-location">South Africa</span>, and all those watching around the world, "Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Those ripples," <span class="xn-person">Robert Kennedy</span> assured us, can "build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Those were beautiful words, but they were more than rhetoric. &#160;They were a call to every member of the global community to embrace the idea &#8211; indeed the truth &#8211; that, more than any policy or program, any controversy or case, justice begins with individual acts. &#160;And it is from many acts of courage, service, and great sacrifice that a nation once known for division is now celebrated and admired around the globe for its method to deal with its past and its power to unite.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>So, what exactly are these tiny ripples? &#160;Where do we find them? &#160;And how do we initiate them? &#160;I have grappled with such questions throughout my entire career. &#160;And I expect many of you struggle with them, as well. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But I have also learned a few things. &#160;And I have seen these so-called "ripples," time and time again, during a life spent studying and practicing law &#8211; first, as a law student, when I spent a summer interning at the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense Fund, working on some of the civil rights cases of the day. &#160;I saw them again after graduation, when I came to work in the Justice Department's new Public Integrity Section. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>That, however, was only the start. &#160;As a judge in D.C. Superior Court, I saw ripples of hope in the heroic stories of law enforcement officials who stood up for public safety. &#160;I saw them in the uplifting examples of criminals reformed, after rehabilitation, and turned into productive citizens. &#160;As U.S. Attorney for the <span class="xn-location">District of Columbia</span>, I saw hope in the activism of community members who came together in times of crisis to safeguard their neighborhoods and help to prevent, not only punish, violence. &#160;And when I served as Deputy Attorney General and was asked by President Clinton to lead Lawyers for One America, I saw those ripples of hope in the attorneys, all across this nation, who banded together for the shared purpose of addressing and eliminating racial inequality in our legal system.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Over many years, in many different ways, I have learned that ripples of hope &#8211; and rooting out injustice one individual action at a time &#8211; can take many forms. &#160;There is no one way to fight for what's right. &#160;I have also learned that achieving justice, like accomplishing anything worthwhile, does not come easily. &#160;But the path to justice always starts with a single action &#8211; and in 2010 it must start with you.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Of course, many of you already know this. &#160;The students here, in the tradition of the Clarke School of Law, have already been working to fulfill the promise of justice &#8211;long before studying for the Bar Exam. &#160;Although this is a small school &#8211; with only 300 students &#8211; you annually provide more than 85,000 hours of public service to low-income community members. &#160;And each UDC law student is required to provide at least 700 hours of clinical service &#8211; to helpless tenants, vulnerable seniors, suffering HIV/AIDS patients, needy children, community groups, and businesses. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Seven hundred hours. &#160;That's incredible. &#160;Imagine, for a moment, if every law student in the country were to give back, as UDC students do, while earning their degrees. &#160;Since there are approximately 150,000 law students at any one time in this country, that would mean about 100 million hours of clinical services combined &#8211; enough to turn tens of thousands of ripples of hope into that "current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance." &#160;I hope that, now, you can start to see my vision, my hope.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Your responsibility to serve others has proven to be not only an effective means of providing your community with much-needed legal assistance, but also an effective means of learning the law. &#160;Joseph Rauh predicted it would be &#8211; and your example shows that he was right. &#160;Today, we can all be encouraged that law schools across the country are taking steps to promote public service and to create opportunities for students to help meet community needs. &#160;But I agree with the assertion by UDC's leadership that all publicly funded law schools should look to the Clarke School of Law for inspiration and consider a similar service requirement. &#160;That would be a profound and powerful change. &#160;And it would lead, no doubt, to a more just nation and world.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Such a paradigm shift in legal education would also align with what I see as an inflection point in our justice system. &#160;I believe we have arrived at a watershed moment. &#160; The choices we now make will reverberate for decades to come. &#160;But some important decisions must be made. &#160;After all, we face a crisis in our justice system &#8211; an environment where, despite our founding promise of justice for all, we still must strive to reach that vaunted goal. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Our indigent defense system, for example, is broken; public defenders in some areas are so overwhelmed that they can spend, at most, an hour per case, many of which present life-altering legal questions and decisions. &#160;The situation is no better in the civil arena. &#160;More than 50 million Americans qualify for federally funded legal assistance, but over half of those who qualify and seek assistance from a federally funded legal assistance program are turned away. &#160;There simply aren't enough resources.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But, fortunately, there are an increasing number of attorneys around the country who are beginning to realize how critical it is that those who have it all &#8211; a law degree, a steady job, a good income &#8211; help those who have next to nothing, free of charge. &#160;And I'm pleased to report that, at the Department of Justice, there is now &#8211; at long last &#8211; an "Access to Justice" office, which is led by the eminent <span class="xn-org">Harvard</span> law professor <span class="xn-person">Laurence Tribe</span> and dedicated to ensuring the fairness, integrity, and improvement of our legal system.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But let me be clear about something: the Justice Department's Access to Justice Initiative is not rooted in the notion that the government can do it all. &#160;Government can't. &#160;And that's where each of you comes in. &#160;To me, UDC's students, alumni, and supporters represent an attitude change that is reaching its "tipping point" and, I expect, will soon become widely accepted practice &#8211; that pro bono work is not merely good, as its Latin name implies, but is necessary - &#160;that it defines the notion of what is expected of an attorney. &#160;That every lawyer should engage in pro bono practice frequently, whether you are a professor, a partner, a student, an associate, or a Department of Justice attorney.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Granted, we're not quite there yet. &#160;An American Bar Association study last year reported a definite rise in pro bono activities among lawyers, but it also noted, and I quote, that "more than three-fourths of those who had performed pro bono service in the past year indicated that they do not seek out pro bono opportunities: the opportunities find them."&#160;And many surveyed still did not participate in pro bono, citing a lack of interest among their employers for such work or the sense that there was no free time to spare. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But all of you, current and future leaders who have regularly engaged in public service and seen the power of these individual and collective acts, can help to fulfill the potential attitude shift that I've just described. &#160;And as you do so, you can &#8211; indeed, I expect you will &#8211; remain engaged in critical pro bono work here in <span class="xn-location">Washington, D.C.</span>, not because the opportunities find you, but because you find them. &#160;As you know well, there is so much need in this city, and so many different ways to use your skills, training, and talents to help others. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>It may not always be easy. &#160;Ripples of hope can be easily smothered by waves of resistance. &#160;The cases you take up may not be glamorous, and your services may not always be appreciated. &#160;And, if you are a student, after you graduate there may no longer be any formal requirement to give back; you'll have to seek out service opportunities.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But I urge you to do just that. &#160;Find ways to contribute and to encourage others to serve. Individual acts, performed in the pursuit of justice, must continue and must spread as far and as wide as possible &#8211; even, and especially, into conference rooms and classrooms where they previously had no place. &#160;That is what this school &#8211; and what both <span class="xn-person">David Clarke</span> and <span class="xn-person">Joseph Rauh</span> &#8211; stood for: training lawyers, not only to be successful, but to be examples for others and to be reminders about the importance and power of pro bono service.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>So tonight, let us renew our commitment to what <span class="xn-person">Robert Kennedy</span> once called in <span class="xn-location">South Africa</span>, "our shared determination to wipe away the unnecessary sufferings of our fellow human beings." &#160;That may not be our only purpose as lawyers, but it is our most sacred and important. &#160;It should, and must, define who we are as attorneys and the legal system within which we operate. &#160;As leaders in our profession you must spread the philosophy of this great institution and make what is unique commonplace.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Thank you. </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and other leading disease and disabilities advocacy groups have filed an amicus brief urging the courts to protect Americans from lawsuits that would undermine protections provided by the nation's new health care reform legislation.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The brief was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of <span class="xn-location">Virginia</span> in response to a lawsuit that, the advocacy groups say, could jeopardize insurance reforms such as the elimination of pre-existing condition clauses.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"The health care reform legislation is a package of inter-related parts," said NORD President and CEO <span class="xn-person">Peter L. Saltonstall</span>. &#160;"If the courts allow legal challenges to weaken any of those parts, the insurance reform protections that patients have fought so hard to secure could be severely threatened."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Other advocacy groups signing the brief with NORD include the March of Dimes Foundation, Families USA, American Association of People with Disabilities, and The Arc of <span class="xn-location">the United States</span>. &#160;In all, 17 groups signed the brief. &#160;They are listed on NORD's website (<a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='96669099';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.rarediseases.org/">www.rarediseases.org</a>).</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The amicus brief is aimed at actions such as the challenge by <span class="xn-location">Virginia</span> Attorney General <span class="xn-person">Ken Cuccinelli</span> against the health reform legislation's "minimum coverage provision," which requires that all individuals assume personal responsibility for acquiring some level of health insurance.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>NORD and other advocacy groups argue that, unless health reform legislation includes such a provision, the cost of implementing reforms will be prohibitive. &#160;The groups expressed particular concern about protecting the reform that prohibits insurers from refusing to provide coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><span class="xn-person">Chris Jennings</span>, a NORD Board member and <span class="xn-location">Washington</span>-based health policy analyst, said that "Ensuring that every American has health coverage spreads the risk more broadly and helps lower costs. &#160;Experience has shown that, in states that have enacted insurance reforms without also having a minimum coverage provision, premiums have skyrocketed."</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> On the heels of today's U.S. Supreme Court decision, <span class="xn-person">Jesse P. Evans III</span>, an attorney of the law firm of <span class="xn-person">Haskell Slaughter Young</span> &amp; Rediker, LLC, who has extensive practice in the area of condemnation law and property rights, released the following statement:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Today the United States Supreme Court decided <u>Stop the Beach Renourishment v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection</u>. In this case, a group of landowners claimed that a decision of the Florida Supreme Court, supposedly redefining some of their property rights in beachfront property, was a taking that required government to compensate them under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.&#160; </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>While the judgment was unanimous against the landowners, it is important to note that the rationale of the Court behind the judgment was sharply divided.&#160; <span class="xn-person">Justice Scalia</span> wrote the main opinion in which he held that a state court decision, like a legislative or executive act, may be a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment requiring compensation to the landowner.&#160; </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The Justice Department today announced that it has filed a stipulated settlement agreement resolving a portion of its lawsuit against <span class="xn-location">Erie County, N.Y.</span>, regarding the limited issue of suicide prevention and related mental health care. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>On <span class="xn-chron">Sept. 30, 2009</span>, the department filed a lawsuit challenging the conditions of confinement at the Erie County Holding Center, a pre-trial detention center in <span class="xn-location">Buffalo, N.Y.</span>, and the Erie County Correctional Facility, a correctional facility in <span class="xn-location">Alden, N.Y.</span> The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of <span class="xn-location">New York</span>, alleges that conditions at the facilities routinely and systemically deprive inmates of constitutional rights.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"After three recent suicides and a serious suicide attempt that left an inmate on life support, we are pleased that <span class="xn-location">Erie County</span> has agreed to promptly implement measures to safeguard inmates from further harm," said <span class="xn-person">Thomas E. Perez</span>, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"After exhaustive mediation and settlement negotiations that resulted in today's agreement, we are hopeful that the parties can continue to find ways to cooperatively resolve the remaining claims in this case to ensure constitutionally conditions of confinement at both facilities," said <span class="xn-person">William J. Hochul Jr.</span>, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of <span class="xn-location">New York</span>. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Since 2005, there have been eight suicides at the holding center, including three suicides that occurred after the Justice Department filed its complaint to remedy unconstitutional conditions that place inmates at risk of serious harm at the facilities. As part of its litigation, <span class="xn-location">the United States</span>' suicide prevention expert found that the suicide rate at the holding center was five times the national average. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The stipulated settlement agreement addresses the county's inadequate system of suicide prevention and self-injurious behavior of holding center inmates. Under the agreement, <span class="xn-location">Erie County</span> and the sheriff will implement detailed remedial measures to ensure that holding center inmates are protected from suicide hazards. Among these measures, the county will improve screening and assessment, provide suicide prevention and detoxification training to holding center staff, improve communication and record keeping, provide safe housing, and establish a risk management system that identifies and corrects deficiencies on an ongoing basis. Compliance with the agreement will be overseen by a jointly selected monitor, who will be paid by the county and will exercise broad duties, respectively, over suicide prevention practices and related mental health care. The county has agreed to provide the monitor broad access to the facility to ensure that the remedial measures are implemented properly. The court will retain jurisdiction over the stipulated settlement for the purpose of enforcing the terms therein.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"These changes, in particular the physical improvements, are needed to ensure the safety of all inmates. But it is also incumbent upon jail staff to follow through to prevent any more unnecessary deaths," said Hochul.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>While the stipulated settlement agreement resolves this limited issue, the department will continue to vigorously advocate the remaining claims of its litigation that include broader mental health care concerns, staff-on-inmate violence, inmate-on-inmate violence, sexual misconduct between staff and inmates, sexual misconduct among inmates, inadequate medical care, and serious deficiencies in environmental health and safety. </p>

		<div class="asset-content entry-content">

	        <div class="asset-body"> Because Bavaria
is unable to respond to all the questions from the press on this issue, it
would like to react with a written statement concerning the arrest of two
Dutch women this morning. Unfortunately, Bavaria has been drawn into the
furore surrounding the arrest of the two ladies, who were wearing orange
dresses worn by thousands of Dutch women and football supporters. Due to the
association, Bavaria feels obligated to respond to the various questions put
to it. Understandably, the well-being of the women is our biggest concern
right now.</p>


							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>    Bavaria regrets that these two Dutch women have now become affected by
the FIFA response to the orange Dutch Dresses they wore in the soccer stadium
last Monday, during the World Cup match between <span class="xn-location">Denmark</span> and <span class="xn-location">the Netherlands</span>.
There is no way FIFA can hold these ladies responsible for their attendance
at the match in their Dutch Dresses, in Soccer City, and Bavaria is currently
doing everything in its power to assist the arrested women. Bavaria has
arranged all legal assistance and housing for them, and keeps close contact
with their families. Bavaria will ask FIFA to immediately stop what it feels
is the intimidation of Dutch-Dressed female supporters. Bavaria takes no
responsibility for the actions of FIFA.</p>


							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>    If FIFA has any problems with our company, we would like to ask them to
contact us directly, and not take action against innocent people wearing our
orange dress. Until now, Bavaria has not heard anything from FIFA directly.
The World Cup tournament should be an enjoyable event for all supporters,
male and female, regardless of their outfits.</p>


							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>    Bavaria's intention with the Dutch Dresses has always been to generate
pleasure and enthusiasm amongst football fans. This was very well understood
and appreciated by the international audience in and around the Soccer City
stadium in <span class="xn-location">Johannesburg</span>. The Dutch Dresses do not have a big brand name logo.
Within a short period of time after their introduction, over 200,000 orange
dresses have been sold in supermarkets in <span class="xn-location">the Netherlands</span> with 8-packs of
Bavaria beer.</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>    As an independent family brewery Bavaria holds a unique position on the
international beer market. For seven generations, the company has been
managed by the Swinkels family. In addition to the Lieshout brewery Bavaria
also works closely together with beer brewery De Koningshoeven (La Trappe).
As the company has two malting plants of its own, the entire brewery process
takes place in-house. Bavaria is the only large brewer in <span class="xn-location">the Netherlands</span> who
brews its beer using pure, natural mineral waters from its own springs. This
characterises Bavaria's key philosophy: a constant high quality of its beers.
Of the six million hectolitres of beer produced annually in the Brabant-based
organisation, nearly 70% is destined for foreign markets. Today, people in
about 130 countries enjoy Bavaria beer. <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='96488779';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.bavaria.nl">http://www.bavaria.nl</a></p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Mesa Law Group, an innovative <span class="xn-location">California</span>-based law firm with specialty financial services has announced a new tool for homeowners considering loan modification but not prepared to retain legal representation. In response to increasing demand for bankruptcies, loan modifications, and foreclosure relief, Mesa Law Group has created the Loan Modification &amp; Finance Preparation (LMFP) Program for those wishing to modify their loan directly with the lender while leveraging the experience of a specialized legal firm. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The program provides the backing of Mesa Law Group's insight and preparation for those directly attempting a modification with their lender on a budget and who want to increase their chances of success. &#160;Mesa Law Group's LMFP Program helps homeowners to organize their finances, navigate the demands of their lender, and directly modify their loan. As bankruptcies and foreclosures are increasing, homeowners are looking for new options, warming up to bankruptcies, and many individuals want to pursue a modification on their own but also know they need help. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>While it is not necessary for a third party to arrange a loan modification or resolution with lenders, the program adds a new option within Mesa Law Group's financial and real estate legal services. Because borrowers may contact their lender directly to propose a modification, the Loan Modification &amp; Finance Preparation Program helps homeowners improve their chances of beneficially modifying their loan. The program specifically takes into account what lenders look for, identifies conditions that must be collected, prepares documents needed, and proposes terms for those wishing to contact their lender directly. &#160;The result is a professionally prepared loan modification package specialized for lender-specific requirements with the benefit of Mesa Law Group's specialized insight at a fraction of the cost of normal loan modification representation. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In addition to Mesa Law Group's comprehensive services for bankruptcies, loan modification, lien stripping, and debt reorganization, this new program helps homeowners on a budget with a detailed mortgage restructuring program that is backed by the company's experience.

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"It has been our experience that homeowners working on their own to directly modify a loan will fail, often for minor reasons. The Loan Modification &amp; Finance Preparation Program is a cost-conscious option for anyone struggling with a tough mortgage and is a powerful tool that can help homeowners in danger of foreclosure. Plus this program helps those who are current and looking for new loan terms under government guidelines for individuals with greater than 31 percent front-end debt to income ratio regardless of status," said <span class="xn-person">Tazwell Randall</span>, VP of Client Relations at Mesa Law Group. "With the addition of this hybrid program Mesa Law Group provides its expertise at a fraction of the cost to those who may not otherwise seek legal help." </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Speaker <span class="xn-person">Nancy Pelosi</span> issued the following statement today in response to President Obama's announcement that BP will set up a <span class="xn-money">$20 billion</span> accountability fund with independent, third-party oversight to pay claims from victims of the BP oil spill, set up a <span class="xn-money">$100 million</span> fund to compensate rig workers, and halt dividend payments this year:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"BP must be held accountable and responsible for paying the full costs of cleaning up the Gulf and restoring the local economy. Following today's meeting with the President, BP executives agreed to create an accountability fund to pay its obligations to the American people -- as proposed by House Democrats earlier this week. And if it takes more than <span class="xn-money">$20 billion</span>, BP will have to cover the full amount for the families, workers, and small business owners of the Gulf Coast. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Responding to calls from Congress, BP has agreed to suspend all dividend payments this year and create a <span class="xn-money">$100 million</span> fund to compensate the workers impacted by the closure of other deep water oil rigs.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"We will monitor BP's payments to those hit hardest by this crisis, and will not hesitate to pass tough legislation if BP fails to follow through on its responsibilities.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"By blocking the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act, Congressional Republicans are opposing legislation that demands financial accountability from BP and Big Oil and protecting oil profits at the expense of our economy and our environment. Democrats will keep standing with America's middle class and small businesses &#8211; on the Gulf Coast and across the country &#8211; and preserving the public interest over special interests."</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Today Final Exit Network began the roll-out of billboards on the nation's highways to help raise public awareness and promote a dialogue on the right to die. The first board appears in <span class="xn-location">San Francisco</span>, and others will follow in <span class="xn-location">New Jersey</span> and <span class="xn-location">Florida</span>. The message is simply, "<span class="xn-person">My Life</span>, <span class="xn-person">My Death</span>, <span class="xn-person">My Choice</span>," with the organization's contact information. Those who view the billboards are encouraged to be in touch with their local media and to share their feelings on the basic human right to a death with dignity. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The boards are being paid for, in part, by member donations. Final Exit President <span class="xn-person">Jerry Dincin</span> said, "Anyone wishing to make a tax-deductible contribution toward future billboards is welcome to do so by earmarking a check for the Billboard Fund to the Final Exit Network." &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The Final Exit Network believes that mentally competent adults have a basic human right to end their lives when they suffer from a fatal or irreversible illness or intractable pain, when their quality of life is personally unacceptable, and the future holds only hopelessness and misery. Such a right shall be an individual choice, including the timing and companion, free of any restriction by the law, clergy, medical profession, even friends and relatives no matter how well-intentioned. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The organization offers free service to all who apply, providing relevant information, home visits if possible and compassionate counseling for the individual and family. It further promotes the use of advanced directives and other legal instruments to document the intentions of any individual. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Final Exit Network is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to counseling, support, and guidance for those clients, who themselves choose the when, how, under what circumstances, and especially IF, to proceed. Dincin stresses that "FEN does not encourage anyone to end their life, does not provide the means to do so and does not actively assist in the person's death. We do, however, believe in the ultimate human right of people to end their lives when circumstances justify, and to have support in carrying out their plan."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Final Exit Network is a five-year-old non-profit run exclusively by volunteers that is committed to serve many whom other organizations may turn away.

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Alcoa sold Three Oaks Mine to Luminant in 2007 but kept ownership of some lignite.&#160; Alcoa claimed that Luminant did not operate Three Oaks Mine prudently and should have stockpiled lower-quality lignite for possible use in Luminant's nearby power plants, Sandow Units 4 and 5.</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The Justice Department today announced that it has reached a consent decree with the township of <span class="xn-location">Green Brook, N.J.</span>, that, if approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of <span class="xn-location">New Jersey</span>, will resolve the department's lawsuit against <span class="xn-location">Green Brook</span> alleging racial discrimination in employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Title VII prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, sex, national origin or religion, and prohibits retaliation against employees for opposing employment practices that they reasonably believe are discriminatory under Title VII, or for filing a complaint of employment discrimination. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The department's complaint, filed today along with the consent decree, alleges that the township discriminated against <span class="xn-person">Anthony Rivera</span>, an African-American road worker in <span class="xn-location">Green Brook</span>'s Department of Public Works. According to the complaint, Rivera was regularly subjected to racial harassment in the workplace by his supervisor, including racially offensive slurs, jokes and remarks, from 2006 through 2009. The complaint further alleges the township unlawfully retaliated against Rivera after he complained to <span class="xn-location">Green Brook</span> management in <span class="xn-chron">October 2007</span> about his supervisor's racial harassment. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Under the terms of the decree, the township must pay Rivera <span class="xn-money">$35,000</span> in compensatory damages. The decree prohibits the township from discriminating against any employee or job applicant on the basis of race, and from engaging in unlawful retaliation. The decree also requires that <span class="xn-location">Green Brook</span> provide training on its anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies to all of its employees and managers. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Our nation's laws ensure that every individual has the right to work in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and retaliation," said <span class="xn-person">Thomas E. Perez</span>, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "The department commends <span class="xn-location">Green Brook</span> for working cooperatively with us to resolve this matter without the need for contested litigation." </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The department's lawsuit was based on a charge of discrimination filed by Rivera with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>As oil continues to spew from the undersea well at estimated rates between 5,000 and 60,000 barrels per day, the list of areas in the <span class="xn-location">Gulf of Mexico</span> closed to commercial and charter fishing grows. The spill could not have come at a worse time, as the peak saltwater-fishing season along the Gulf Coast starts in March and continues throughout the summer. Bookings include private groups and fishing tournaments, both of which are seeing major cancellations as oil ruins what were prime fishing grounds. Even with some areas still open, visitors who might have booked a charter excursion are skittish due to fears that fish will be tainted by the spill.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"This is the worst possible time for a catastrophe like this, just at the beginning of peak fishing and tourist season along the Gulf Coast," <span class="xn-person">Rhon Jones</span>, head of <span class="xn-person">Beasley Allen</span>'s Environmental Law section, said. &#160;"The charter fishing industry is hit with a double-whammy. They are losing business because some areas are now off limits to fishing and they can't take people there. Plus, bookings are down for the areas that are open because tourists and fishing tournaments are afraid of fumes and oily beaches and waters."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The oil spill comes at what would normally be the beginning of the most profitable time for the Gulf Coast region, which traditionally collects almost 73 percent of its tourism revenues in the second and third quarters (April-September). Early estimates since the spill indicate tourism in the area may be down by 30 to 50 percent this summer.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The suit is filed in federal court in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of <span class="xn-location">Louisiana</span> on behalf of plaintiff <span class="xn-person">Martin R. Cressey</span> d/b/a Bohica Fishing Charters, and seeks damages for real and personal property, earning capacity, business income, and other damages related to the disaster. The suit alleges negligence and wanton misconduct. Defendants named in the suit are BP, Halliburton, and Cameron International.</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In <span class="xn-chron">January 2008</span>, investigators with ICE executed search warrants on the defendants' business address, Coco USA, located in <span class="xn-location">Manhattan</span>. According to evidence presented at trial, during the execution of the search warrant, investigators seized approximately 1,500 cartons of alleged infringing items. The total value of the corresponding authentic luxury goods manufactured by Burberry, <span class="xn-person">Louis Vuitton</span>, Gucci, Coach, Fendi, Chanel and others is estimated to be over <span class="xn-money">$100 million</span>. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"The defendants convicted yesterday led a massive counterfeit goods operation that stretched from <span class="xn-location">China</span> to <span class="xn-location">New York</span>," said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. "The Department of Justice will continue aggressively to prosecute intellectual property crimes and to protect business and consumers alike from those looking to cheat their way to a quick profit." </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"This case is about economic identity theft and blatant disregard of the law," said U.S. Attorney MacBride. "These convictions reinforce the integrity of our nation's intellectual property laws that the Eastern District of <span class="xn-location">Virginia</span> is committed to enforcing."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"This landmark conviction represents the latest success of ICE in targeting intellectual property thieves," said <span class="xn-person">John Morton</span>, Assistant Secretary for ICE. "Through the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, ICE will continue working to stem the flow of counterfeit goods into the commerce of <span class="xn-location">the United States</span>."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The government is seeking forfeiture of the illicit proceeds of the enterprise, including funds that the defendants had transferred to bank accounts in <span class="xn-location">the United States</span> and overseas in the names of companies under their control, as well as three properties in <span class="xn-location">New York</span>. All of these assets had previously been frozen by court order.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>At sentencing, scheduled for <span class="xn-chron">Sept. 15, 2010</span>, Lam and Chan each face a maximum of five years in prison and a <span class="xn-money">$250,000</span> fine for the conspiracy count, 10 years in prison and a <span class="xn-money">$2 million</span> fine for each trafficking count, and 5 years in prison and a <span class="xn-money">$250,000</span> fine for each smuggling count. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>A third defendant, <span class="xn-person">Eric Yuen</span>, 41, who was originally charged with Lam and Chan in <span class="xn-chron">January 2008</span>, was found not guilty on all counts yesterday. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys <span class="xn-person">Brian R. Hood</span> and <span class="xn-person">Jessica A. Brumberg</span> in the Eastern District of <span class="xn-location">Virginia</span> and Trial Attorney <span class="xn-person">John H. Zacharia</span> of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). The case was investigated by ICE.</p>

The trial lawyers, a major contributor to Congressional campaign coffers, are the only beneficiary of the current system, and <span class="xn-location">Washington</span> appears unwilling to take them on, especially in an election year.

	        <div class="asset-body"> Consumer Watchdog today praised three Congressmen for releasing Google's purported explanation of its three-year WiSpy snooping and endorsed a call for a Congressional hearing about the incident. Consumer Watchdog also called for the Federal Communications Commission to investigate.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Google Chairman <span class="xn-person">Eric Schmidt</span> and Co-Founders Larry Page and <span class="xn-person">Sergey Brin</span> need to testify under oath to Congress about what data Google gathered and what they did with it," said <span class="xn-person">John M. Simpson</span>, consumer advocate with the nonpartisan, nonprofit group.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Google's explanation came in a letter signed by Google lobbyist <span class="xn-person">Pablo Chavez</span> to U.S. Reps. <span class="xn-person">Joe Barton</span>, R-<span class="xn-location">Texas</span>, <span class="xn-person">Edward Markey</span>, D-Mass., and <span class="xn-person">Henry A. Waxman</span>, D-Calif. The congressmen seemed skeptical of Google's response and Barton said "this matter warrants a hearing, at minimum."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"This is deeply troubling for a company that bases its business model on gathering consumer data," Barton said. "That failure is even more disturbing and ironic in view of the fact that Google is lobbying the government to regulate Internet service providers, but not Google."</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Transparency and trust are the key cornerstones that form the foundation of strong privacy protections for consumers. It's clear that in this case, Google fell short in both these areas," Markey said. "In its response to our inquiry, Google admitted mistakes it made in this matter and indicated that it has taken corrective action, including termination of its collection of WiFi data entirely by its Street View cars. We have raised concerns about this matter with the Federal Trade Commission on this important issue and will continue to actively and aggressively monitor developments in this area." </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Barton said a hearing would be appropriate because Congress is contemplating privacy legislation. A discussion draft of the privacy bill has been circulated for comment by the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet. In response to the draft, ten leading privacy and consumer organizations sent a letter to Subcommittee Chairman Rep. <span class="xn-person">Rick Boucher</span> and Ranking Member Cliff Stearns calling for much stronger provisions to protect consumer privacy both online and off. </p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Each of these troopers put his life on the line to protect the citizens of <span class="xn-location">Pennsylvania</span>," Pawlowski said. "They are courageous and dedicated individuals whose heroic actions reflect the high standards of the <span class="xn-location">Pennsylvania</span> State Police."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Lombardo was shot in an incident that claimed the life of Tpr. <span class="xn-person">Joshua D. Miller</span>, 34, of Troop N, <span class="xn-location">Swiftwater</span>, on <span class="xn-chron">June 7, 2009</span>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Lombardo and Miller were involved in a 40-mile pursuit of a man who threatened his estranged wife with a gun and abducted their son. The fleeing vehicle was brought to a stop in <span class="xn-location">Coolbaugh Township</span>, <span class="xn-location">Monroe County</span>. As troopers approached the car, shots were exchanged, with bullets striking Miller, Lombardo and the suspect. The suspect was killed, but his son was rescued unharmed from the car.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Miller was flown from the scene to the Lehigh Valley Hospital, where he died of his wounds.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Despite being shot himself, Tpr. Lombardo did not seek medical attention until he helped bring the incident to a close," Pawlowski said.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Goss responded to Route 6 in <span class="xn-location">Conewago Township</span>, <span class="xn-location">Warren County</span>, around <span class="xn-chron">10:30 p.m.</span> on <span class="xn-chron">Dec. 24, 2009</span>, for a report of pickup truck being driven erratically. When he was notified that the pickup was traveling east in the westbound lanes, Goss activated the emergency lighting of his unmarked patrol car and passed a Jeep Cherokee that was the lead vehicle in a line of westbound traffic.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>As the eastbound pickup approached, Goss maneuvered his patrol car in front of the Jeep Cherokee and angled the passenger side of the car towards the oncoming vehicle. The pickup struck the right rear of the patrol car at about 60 miles per hour.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Without reservation or regard for his own safety, Tpr. Goss put himself at grave risk to prevent a head-on crash between the pickup and the Jeep Cherokee," Pawlowski said. "Four members of an <span class="xn-location">Erie</span> family were riding in the Jeep. Who can say how many lives were saved by the trooper's action?"</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Following the crash, Goss checked on the occupants of the Jeep Cherokee, who were uninjured. He and another trooper then removed the uninjured driver from the pickup, who was charged with driving under the influence, reckless driving and other counts.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Lampel and Tpr. <span class="xn-person">Joseph J. Sepp</span> were among state and municipal officers responding to a pursuit of a suspected drunk driver who fled from a traffic stop in <span class="xn-location">Summerhill Township</span>, <span class="xn-location">Cambria County</span>, on <span class="xn-chron">Nov. 9, 2002</span>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The fleeing vehicle hit a utility pole in <span class="xn-location">Ebensburg</span> and came to a stop as Lampel and Sepp, who was driving, arrived at the scene. Lampel got out of the patrol car and ordered the suspect to show his hands. The suspect exited his vehicle with a gun in each hand and immediately began firing at the troopers. Lampel, Sepp and four municipal officers returned fire. Two of Lampel's shots hit the suspect.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Sepp was hit by one of the suspect's shots and died the following day. The suspect recovered from his wounds and was convicted of first-degree murder.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Tpr. Lampel exhibited proper restraint in ordering the suspect to surrender," Pawlowski said. "He then risked injury or death by maintaining his position and returning fire."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Lombardo, who lives with his wife in <span class="xn-location">Pittston</span>, <span class="xn-location">Luzerne County</span>, enlisted in the state police in 2003.

	        <div class="asset-body"> Family Research Council Action PAC unveiled a new website, <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='96175229';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.stopcharlie.com">www.stopcharlie.com</a>, and a state-wide radio ad campaign in response to Governor <span class="xn-person">Charlie Crist</span>'s veto of commonsense ultrasound legislation.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Governor Crist vetoed the proposed law which prescribes an ultrasound prior to every abortion. Women must be allowed to view the live ultrasound images, though they must also be informed that they have the right to decline to view them under the law. The governor issued the veto only days after removing a pro-life section from his campaign website. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The radio ad will begin running state-wide early next week. The ad states, "Crist used to claim to be pro-life. Now he's just pro-Crist. Since leaving his party he's decided he'd rather be pro-abortion, removing the pro-life section from his website and vetoing a bill that would allow women to see an ultrasound of their child before having an abortion."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><b>FRC</b><b> Action PAC Chairman <span class="xn-person">Tony Perkins</span></b> released the following statement regarding the veto:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Governor Crist has once again broken trust with the voters of <span class="xn-location">Florida</span> by vetoing a commonsense bill that would ensure that women receive factual information before an abortion. Sadly, he vetoed legislation that would strengthen a woman's right to know. &#160;Charlie Crist is willing to go to any extreme to please far Left special interest groups," said Perkins.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Perkins also added, "<span class="xn-person">Charlie Crist</span> has shown over and over again a willingness to abandon core moral values in his quest to become the next U.S. Senator from <span class="xn-location">Florida</span>. He must be stopped in his quest to become the next U.S. Senator from <span class="xn-location">Florida</span>, which is why FRC Action PAC is launching this state-wide radio campaign."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"In contrast, <span class="xn-person">Marco Rubio</span> has been a true friend of the family and the culture of life as a state legislator in <span class="xn-location">Florida</span>. Senators who will fight to defend the family against the radical leadership in the Senate are crucial to the future of our country," said Perkins.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Rep. Rubio has fought to protect mothers and their unborn children. He supported pro-life legislation that would require doctors to complete ultrasounds before performing abortions thus giving the mother an opportunity to assess the consequences of her actions. Rep. Rubio also understands the importance of adult stem cell research in treating patients. He also endorsed legislation to ensure that taxpayers aren't forced to fund embryonic stem cell research," concluded Perkins.</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> A federal grand jury in <span class="xn-location">San Francisco</span> returned a superseding indictment against the largest Taiwanese thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display panels (TFT-LCD) producer and seller, its <span class="xn-location">Houston</span>-based American subsidiary, and six of its executives for participating in a conspiracy to fix prices of TFT-LCD panels, the Department of Justice announced today. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The indictment, returned last night and filed today in U.S. District Court in <span class="xn-location">San Francisco</span>, charges that AU Optronics Corporation participated in a conspiracy to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels sold worldwide from <span class="xn-chron">Sept. 14, 2001</span>, to <span class="xn-chron">Dec. 1, 2006</span>. AU Optronics Corporation, its American subsidiary, AU Optronics Corporation America, and six AU Optronics' executives, each a resident of <span class="xn-location">Taiwan</span>, participated in the conspiracy at various times during the alleged conspiracy time period. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones and other electronic devices. By the end of the conspiracy period, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was valued at <span class="xn-money">$70 billion</span>. Companies directly affected by the LCD price-fixing conspiracy include some of the largest computer and television manufacturers in the world, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett Packard.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>During the period covered by the indictment: </p>

Perez at the National Disability Rights Network Annual Conference</a><div style="font-weight:lighter;color:#696969;font-size: 12px;font-style:italic;">June 11, 2010</div></h2></div>
		<div class="asset-content entry-content">
		<div id="googlepic"></div>
	        <div class="asset-body"> The following remarks by Assistant Attorney General <span class="xn-person">Thomas E. Perez</span><b> </b>were released today by the U.S. Department of Justice:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Thank you, <span class="xn-person">Catherine (Blakemore)</span>. It's a pleasure to be with you today, to celebrate not only the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but the tireless work of the advocates who worked to see its passage 20 years ago, and who continue today to persist in the belief that every single person in this nation is entitled to access and to the rights guaranteed by our constitution.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Most people in our nation, when they think of "Civil Rights," they think of Dr. King on the steps of the <span class="xn-org">Lincoln Memorial</span>, of hundreds of protestors on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, of students at lunch counters and university doors.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Sometimes forgotten when we talk about civil rights are the other movements, the other communities that have had to claw their way out from under the weight of immoral laws and misguided social mores. Women spent decades fighting for the right to vote, facing ridicule, and sometimes imprisonment, before the 19th amendment passed in 1920. LGBT individuals have struggled for acceptance and battled wave after wave of misunderstanding and hate; they continue to make the case that they deserve the same rights as all individuals.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>From our nation's founding, individuals have fought for their rights, facing dozens of defeats for each victory. Progress has so often been painfully incremental. But each victory, however small, was motivation enough to keep moving.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>And so it has been for persons with disabilities in our nation. Individuals with disabilities faced every day the indignities of not being able to enter public buildings or get on a public bus, of being barred from attending schools and getting jobs. Until, that is, the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The ADA literally opened millions of doors for individuals with disabilities across this nation.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Upon its passage, Senator <span class="xn-person">Ted Kennedy</span> spoke on the Senate floor of its significance: he said "The act has the potential to become one of the great civil rights laws of our generation. Disabled citizens deserve the opportunity to work for a living, ride a bus, have access to public and commercial buildings, and do all the other things that the rest of us take for granted. Mindless physical barriers and outdated social attitudes have made them second class citizens for too long. This legislation is a bill of rights for the disabled, and America will be a better and fairer nation because of it."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Twenty years later, we know that he was right. This critical law has had implications no less important or far-reaching than the landmark civil rights laws of the 1960s. And as the head of the Civil Rights Division, I have the distinct honor of leading enforcement. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>And we've been busy. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In the two decades since its enactment, the ADA has revolutionized the way the rest of society thinks about individuals with disabilities, and it revolutionized the way that people with disabilities live in our communities.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But, as you all well know, and as with so many areas of civil rights enforcement, the great progress made does not mark the end of our journey. As we prepare to celebrate two decades of the ADA, the Civil Rights Division is celebrating 20 years of great progress by recommitting to tackling head on the remaining and emerging challenges.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>We are working to end the illegal but all too common practice of unnecessarily segregating people with disabilities in institutions. Eleven years ago this month, in its landmark ruling in<i> Olmstead v. L.C.</i>, the Supreme Court determined that ADA requires that people with disabilities e provided services in the most integrated setting appropriate. It was the <span class="xn-org">Brown</span> v. the Board of Education of the Disability Rights Movement.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But ten years after the landmark decision, tens of thousands of Americans with disabilities are still unnecessarily and unconstitutionally confined in institutions, some with unspeakably dangerous conditions.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>I had the opportunity during a recent trip to <span class="xn-location">Birmingham, Alabama</span>, to meet <span class="xn-person">Paul Boyd</span>. In 1995, while a sophomore in college, Paul was injured in an accident that left him paralyzed below the collar bone. Paul eventually returned to college in his hometown of <span class="xn-location">Montevallo</span>, graduating in 2007. By then, Paul had entered a nursing home, and his disability has made it, in his own words, "next to impossible" to find work that would allow him to live independently.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Earlier this year, Paul was accepted to a graduate program at the <span class="xn-org">University of Montevallo</span> to seek his master's degree in community counseling. But because his classes would be at night, a lack of transportation to travel the 13 miles from his facility to the University might keep him from being able to begin the program. Paul said that if he could get out of the nursing facility and receive services in his community in <span class="xn-location">Montevallo</span>, he could easily make it to his classes. In order to live independently, he would need personal assistance to help him bathe and dress and get into his wheelchair. He would also need assistance with some basic household chores. <span class="xn-location">Montevallo</span> is Paul's hometown, and he has an extended support network of siblings and friends there.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>It is because of people like Paul, people who would benefit from living in the community, and whose communities would benefit from having them there, that President Obama marked Olmstead's 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary by proclaiming the Year of Community Living. Under his leadership, we have made it a priority to enforce Olmstead.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Since the beginning of the Obama Administration, the Division has filed amicus briefs in cases in <span class="xn-location">Connecticut</span>, <span class="xn-location">Virginia</span>, <span class="xn-location">North Carolina</span>, <span class="xn-location">Illinois</span>, <span class="xn-location">Florida</span>, <span class="xn-location">New Jersey</span> and <span class="xn-location">California</span>; filed lawsuits in <span class="xn-location">Arkansas</span> and <span class="xn-location">Georgia</span> and intervened in a case in <span class="xn-location">New York</span>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In tight budget times like these, we must be persistent in our insistence that jurisdictions not allow themselves to move backwards because of declining revenues. The Civil rights Division intervened in two cases in <span class="xn-location">North Carolina</span> over the issue of allowing individuals who have been placed in community settings to stay there. While the case is pending, we successfully obtained a preliminary injunction that will keep the individuals whose lives in the community are threatened by the budget cutbacks in their homes and communities.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>On all of our Olmstead efforts, we are working closely with our sister agencies to ensure that our approach to making the promise of Olmstead a reality is a holistic, coordinated one.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In addition to Olmstead, we are also working to combat other types of discrimination by public entities. In some cases, the discrimination is overt &#8211; take, for example, our case against the city of <span class="xn-location">Baltimore</span> for mandating that substance abuse centers get special zoning permits when other entities don't have to. In other cases, cities and towns simply forgo their obligations to make their programs, services and activities accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>We continue to promote voluntary compliance in these cases through Project Civic Access, where cities and municipalities work cooperatively without litigation to reach compliance with Title II. The 178 agreements under the program to date deal with all aspects of civic life including courthouses, health departments, libraries, parks, theaters and stadiums, sidewalks, and emergency shelters, as well as employment, voting, emergency preparedness, and effective communication especially in law enforcement and 9-1-1 services.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But civic access is a civil right, and when jurisdictions will not cooperatively comply, we will not hesitate to file suit.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>We recently settled a case against <span class="xn-location">Jackson, Mississippi</span> for failing to make their public transit system accessible or make their para-transit systems fully compliant with their obligations under the ADA. The consent decree with <span class="xn-location">Jackson</span> mandates not only that busses include wheelchair lifts, but that bus drivers call out stops for passengers who are blind and that the para-transit allow reliable next day service. This is particularly critical because it ensures that the plaintiffs in the case, teachers who are blind, have accessible transportation to their place of work, the Mississippi School for the Blind.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But accessible public facilities mean little to an individual who can't find accessible housing. The Fair Housing Act and the ADA have specific accessibility mandates, and yet far too many developers continue to forgo their obligations, either knowingly or out of ignorance of the law. On this front, we have recently settled two matters -- one in <span class="xn-location">Iowa</span> and the most recent in <span class="xn-location">Tennessee</span>. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In both cases we insisted that the developers not only fix their inaccessible properties, but also to pay compensation to the persons with disabilities who sought to live in the developments. We also have an extensive outreach program to educate developers and architects about their obligations so that we can reduce the number of inaccessible developments built in the first place.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Along with housing, access to healthcare is among the most basic and critical needs for all individuals. The landmark healthcare reform legislation signed this year by President Obama will ensure that millions of Americans with disabilities can get the coverage they need but were too often denied because of the pre-existing condition clauses in insurance policies. But as long as we have inaccessible hospital facilities or hospitals that do not use accessible medical equipment, many individuals with disabilities will continue to be unable to access critical care. This issue is a top priority for us, and we will soon be releasing guidance on accessible medical equipment.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>All of these are battles that individuals with disabilities have been fighting for decades. The ADA has placed the power of the law behind those fights, and we continue to use it as a vital tool to break down long-standing barriers and advance civil rights in our nation. It has also proven to be a critical tool as we address emerging challenges.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In the 21st century, technology drives so much of our work and our lives, and it seems to advance daily. Technology has revolutionized our economy and culture. It has made obtaining information, entertainment, education and goods easier and more efficient. But many of these technologies, from Web sites to cell phones, from ticket kiosks to TV set-top devices, are either in whole or in part inaccessible to persons who are blind and other people with disabilities. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>We know that inaccessible technologies can pose significant challenges to individuals with disabilities, and we must remain vigilant to ensure new technologies don't leave individuals with disabilities in their wake.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>We acted swiftly on the complaints we received from the National Federation of the Blind about the use of the Amazon Kindle at universities, and we reached agreements with five major universities: <span class="xn-location">Princeton</span>; the <span class="xn-org">University of Arizona</span>; <span class="xn-org">Pace</span>; <span class="xn-org">Case Western</span>; and <span class="xn-org">Reed College</span>. Those institutions have agreed not to use inaccessible electronic readers, and we will continue to make sure other institutions nationwide are aware of their accessibility obligations.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>And though we have seen some voluntary efforts by companies once the matter is brought to their attention, far too many companies choose to forgo making their products and services accessible to all consumers.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Let me be clear. It is and has been the position of the Department of Justice since the late 1990s that Title III of the ADA applies to websites. We intend to issue regulations under our Title III authority in this regard to help companies comply with their obligations to provide equal access.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>All of these efforts at the Department of Justice are critical to ensuring that the promise of the ADA becomes a reality for all individuals with disabilities in our nation.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>But no matter how aggressively we enforce the law, 20 years after the signing of the ADA we still face the challenge of attitudes and stereotypes that stigmatize disabilities and are every bit as destructive as racism, sexism, homophobia and the other prejudices that have certainly lessened over time, but have not been completely eradicated from our hearts and minds. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>When the Civil Rights Division has to enforce the right of a family with an HIV positive child because the owner of an RV resort tells them that their two-year-old can't swim in the swimming pool, as we did in a case in <span class="xn-location">Alabama</span>, we know we still have a long way to go.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>When the Civil Rights Division has to bring a case against an attorney--of all people-- who refuses to allow a woman with a service dog into his office, as we did in <span class="xn-location">Colorado</span>, we know we have a long way to go.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>When the Civil Rights Division has to fight for a the right of a social worker who is deaf to be hired doing a job for which she is imminently qualified because the government employer doesn't want to accommodate her with a part-time interpreter, as we did in <span class="xn-location">California</span>, we know we have a long way to go.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The progress made in 20 years is remarkable. But our anniversary celebration must be marked by turning our attention to the next 20 years so that we can continue to create a nation where every individual has access to equal opportunity and equal justice.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Thank you. </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Governor <span class="xn-person">Edward G. Rendell</span> today heralded the release of a new public opinion poll showing 93 percent of Pennsylvanians want the opportunity to vote on whether to change the way appellate court judges are selected.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Governor Rendell was joined for the poll's release by former <span class="xn-location">Pennsylvania</span> governors <span class="xn-person">Dick Thornburgh</span>, <span class="xn-person">Tom Ridge</span> and <span class="xn-person">Mark Schweiker</span> &#8211; all Republicans. Governors Thornburgh and Ridge participated in the event by telephone.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Merit selection is a bipartisan issue, and a long overdue reform," said Governor Rendell. &#160;"There are many reasons why <span class="xn-location">Pennsylvania</span> needs to make this change, and the bottom line is that if we embrace merit selection, we will get the most qualified, fair and impartial judges to serve our residents. The people understand this, which is why they overwhelmingly want the right to vote on a new way to select judges."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The poll, conducted recently for Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts and its lobbying affiliate, PMCAction, found 73 percent do not believe that the most qualified candidates win elections, and 76 percent believe campaign contributions influence judicial decision-making. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Considered together, reform advocates said those two findings indicate public frustration with the electoral system and justify a desire to find a better way to choose judges for the Supreme, Superior and Commonwealth Courts.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The poll found that 62 percent of respondents favor replacing the current appellate judicial election system with merit selection, a hybrid system that combines elements of appointive and electoral systems, with a citizens nominating commission that screens candidates and recommends the most highly qualified for possible nomination.</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Clarient, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a href='http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&Ticker=CLRT' target='_blank' title='CLRT'>CLRT</a>), a premier technology and services resource for pathologists, oncologists and the pharmaceutical industry, today announced that the United Kingdom Patent Office has granted a U.K. patent on the Company's TLE3 biomarker, a marker which may be used to predict which cancer patients will respond favorably to taxane therapy. &#160;In addition, the Company has received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a U.S. patent on the TLE3 biomarker. &#160;Other patents for the TLE3 biomarker are pending in the U.S., <span class="xn-location">Canada</span>, <span class="xn-location">Japan</span>, <span class="xn-location">China</span>, <span class="xn-location">India</span> and elsewhere in <span class="xn-location">Europe</span>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The U.S. patent will cover uses of the TLE3 biomarker in breast cancer. &#160;The U.K. patent covers uses of TLE3 in breast, lung and ovarian cancers.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Taxanes are important cancer therapeutics which, in combination with other cancer therapies, can markedly improve a patient's response rate to therapy. &#160;However, taxanes also carry with them a significant incidence of severe side effects, making it important to identify which patients will most likely benefit from the therapy.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Given the frequent prescription of taxanes in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere in <span class="xn-location">Europe</span> and the world, we are very excited about the granting of these patents and the protection they provide our taxane sensitivity marker," said Clarient Vice Chairman and CEO <span class="xn-person">Ron Andrews</span>. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The TLE3 biomarker is the anchor of Clarient's proprietary taxane predictive product line that includes an array of tests created for lung, ovarian and breast cancers, among others. &#160;Clarient's Ovatax&#8482; assay for ovarian cancer and Mammotax&#8482; assay for breast cancer are expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2010, and launch of its Pulmotax&#8482; assay for lung cancer is expected in 2011.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"The allowed U.S. patent for Mammotax will give Clarient immediate protection for the first taxane sensitivity product we plan to bring to market," said <span class="xn-person">Rob Seitz</span>, Clarient's Senior Vice President for Technology Assessment and one of the inventors on the patent.&#160; "Furthermore, it validates our overall patent strategy for this important biomarker, giving Clarient greater confidence that our efforts in the entire TLE3 product portfolio will receive intellectual property protection."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Commenting further, Andrews added, "We believe our taxane product line further differentiates Clarient in the cancer diagnostics marketplace. &#160;The fact that TLE3 can identify the responders to taxanes provides clinicians with an important piece of information which may allow them to determine whether a patient should receive a taxane as part of a therapeutic regimen. &#160;Given the toxicity of taxanes, there are significant hospital and emergency room costs associated with its use in a high percentage of patients. &#160;Therefore, it also has important health economic ramifications for managed care organizations and other payors, potentially allowing them to save millions of dollars in unnecessary costs for non-beneficial treatments so the patient's cancer can be managed in a more effective and economically efficient way."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Clarient is currently in discussions with several international partners to expand the reach of the TLE3 products outside the U.S., including the possible creation of diagnostic test kits for distribution in key world markets.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The TLE3 U.K. patent GB2460769, was granted on <span class="xn-chron">May 4, 2010</span> and published in the Patents Journal on <span class="xn-chron">June 2, 2010</span>. &#160;The Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for U.S. Application No. 12/578255 is dated <span class="xn-chron">June 3, 2010</span>. &#160;The patents will issue in the name of Applied Genomics, Inc.,&#160;a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clarient.</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>On <span class="xn-chron">June 7, 2010</span>, the Honorable William C. Griesbach ruled in Destiny's favor, directing the Clerk to dismiss Yangaroo's claim in its entirety.</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>On <span class="xn-chron">May 5, 2009</span>, Yangaroo, a competitor in the Canadian market, had filed a complaint for patent infringement against Destiny, claiming that Destiny's Play MPE&#174; secure distribution system infringed on their US patent number 7,529,712, issued the same day.</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>VitaminSpice is still the only recognized vitamin-infused line of gourmet spices on the market. &#160;Filing the United States and worldwide patent applications is important considering the agreements in place with <span class="xn-person">Bill Fields</span>, former CEO of Walmart Stores Division, and his company Intersource Enterprises LTD which will be introducing VitaminSpice in <span class="xn-location">China</span>. These patents provide the ultimate protection for the technology, processes and other aspects of the innovative products. &#160;Production and logistical preparations for the mass distribution of the products have been underway for some time. &#160;The implementation of the distribution, marketing, and sales support for the product has begun and should generate significant revenue increases for VitaminSpice in the coming weeks, months, and quarters.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p><span class="xn-person">Edward Bukstel</span>, VitaminSpice CEO stated, "The VitaminSpice product is completely unique to the market. &#160;We continue to make improvements to the product and have exciting new products lines in the pipeline for our customers in retail, institutional, and food service. The company moved aggressively to protect its intellectual property. &#160;Now that we have these US and worldwide patents filed we will aggressively move to bring the product to market and bring VitaminSpice to profitability as quickly as possible."</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>VitaminSpice is uniquely positioned between the <span class="xn-money">$125 billion</span> health food/vitamin supplement industry and the multi-trillion-dollar traditional food industry. A pioneer in the emerging Foodceutical industry, VitaminSpice sells vitamin-, mineral- and antioxidant-infused spices of their own. In addition, the vitamin-infused seasonings can be combined and co-branded with virtually any conventional food on the market. VitaminSpice offerings include Crushed Red Pepper, Ground Black Pepper, Italian Seasoning, Ground Cinnamon and Granulated Garlic. A proprietary micro-encapsulation process keeps vitamin properties locked inside, even when heated, allowing the food products to retain their full flavor. In addition, several seasonings and dessert toppings have been co-branded with Iron Chef.</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The '983 Patent was the basis of a judgment entered by the U.S. Federal Court for the District of <span class="xn-location">Massachusetts</span> in <span class="xn-chron">June 2009</span> that found Fenwal guilty of patent infringement, and liable to Haemonetics for <span class="xn-money">$18 million</span> in damages for past sales of the infringing product, and which imposed a 10% royalty for future sales of the infringing product until an injunction was to be effective <span class="xn-chron">December 1, 2010</span>. &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>On <span class="xn-chron">June 2, 2010</span>, a three judge panel of <span class="xn-location">the United States</span> Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision on Fenwal's Appeal, reversing in part, vacating in part, and remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The Appeals Court ruling did not invalidate Haemonetics' patent and made no decision about whether Fenwal's product infringed, leaving the question of infringement to be decided after further proceedings before the district court. Haemonetics' CEO <span class="xn-person">Brian Concannon</span> said, "Haemonetics wants this matter resolved as quickly as possible so that our customers can plan accordingly. &#160;We're surprised at the Federal Appeals Court's decision, especially in light of the Patent Office decision confirming the validity of our patent."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Haemonetics believes that notwithstanding the Appeals Court instructions on claim construction on remand to the trial court, Fenwal's product still infringes Haemonetics' patent. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The Appeals Court ruling has no impact on Haemonetics' corresponding foreign patent rights in <span class="xn-location">Japan</span>, <span class="xn-location">Germany</span>, <span class="xn-location">France</span>, <span class="xn-location">Italy</span> and the UK. &#160;</p>

The Court has scheduled a hearing at <span class="xn-chron">9:00 AM</span> New York City time on <span class="xn-chron">June 10, 2010</span>, ahead of the expiration of the Sembcorp Tender Offer (the "Offer"), which currently expires at <span class="xn-chron">11:00 AM</span> New York City time on <span class="xn-chron">June 21, 2010</span>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Cascal has serious objections to the Offer, including: the manner in which the Offer was prepared, the below market value assigned to Cascal shares and the Offer structure. The Company also objects to the unconditional and irrevocable terms Biwater accepted by agreeing to tender its Cascal shares to Sembcorp. As Cascal outlined in its filing with the Court, each of these items conflicts with fundamental principles set forth under Dutch corporate law and conflicts with the interests and fundamental obligations towards Cascal and Cascal's minority shareholders.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Cascal has asked the Court to protect the rights of its minority shareholders by, among other things: appointing a special trustee to temporarily oversee Biwater's holdings in Cascal, or alternatively, suspending Biwater's right to vote its shares or to tender its shares to Sembcorp. &#160;The Company has asked the Court to maintain these provisions until such time that Sembcorp has committed itself to guaranteeing a sufficient number of independent members on Cascal's Board that have adequate approval and veto rights on resolutions affecting the interests of Cascal's minority shareholders. &#160;The Company has also asked that Sembcorp refrain from cancelling Cascal's New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing and/or cancelling Cascal's share registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). &#160;Additionally, Cascal petitioned the Court to suspend the Cascal directors that are also affiliated with Biwater.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The Board of Directors has indicated that it is pursuing a number of additional initiatives to protect the interests of stockholders against Sembcorp's inadequate and coercive offer.</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The following is being released by <span class="xn-person">Leonard Carder</span>, LLP:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In a ruling that could have far-reaching national implications, a Federal court judge issued the first summary judgment ruling that FedEx Ground and Home Delivery drivers in <span class="xn-location">Illinois</span> are employees of the company - not independent contractors - under that state's Wage Act.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>U.S. District Court Judge <span class="xn-person">Robert Miller</span>, who has been presiding over the 63 cases in the multi-district litigation for the past five years (FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. Employment Practices Litigation, Cause No. 3:05-MD-527 RM), issued an Opinion and Order on <span class="xn-chron">May 28, 2010</span> granting the drivers summary judgment - a first in the protracted litigation - to the drivers, who the company has maintained in that and other cases throughout the U.S. are independent contractors. "This ruling is a step forward for not only the <span class="xn-location">Illinois</span> drivers, but for many other FedEx drivers across the country whose rights arise under similar laws," according to <span class="xn-person">Lynn Faris, Esq.</span>, a <span class="xn-location">California</span> lawyer and one of the lead attorneys representing the drivers who allege that FedEx has intentionally and consistently misclassified drivers as independent contractors even though they are in reality employees.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In this opinion, Judge Miller specifically found that the drivers were employees because their delivery work was an essential and necessary part of FedEx's business. The judge cited testimony by former FedEx CEO <span class="xn-person">Dan Sullivan</span> who said the drivers are the "centerpiece" of FedEx's "workforce" and they are an "essential component" of the company's business. The Court noted that the drivers - fixtures in neighborhoods across America - must wear FedEx uniforms and drive logo-ed trucks to support the FedEx brand. &#160;The court also found that FedEx structures the drivers' routes so that the trucks are in use nine to 11 hours a day; allows for the hiring of replacement drivers, but only with FedEx's approval; and the drivers were required to permit FedEx managers to have business discussions and customer service rides annually in the vehicles in order to maintain FedEx's image and reputation. &#160;"These same facts suggest that FedEx controlled the drivers work to such an extent that all the drivers were and are employees," commented <span class="xn-person">Jerry Cureton, Esq.</span>, a <span class="xn-location">New Jersey</span> lawyer and counsel to the plaintiffs.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Similar plaintiffs' motions for Summary Judgment in 39 other states are pending, fully briefed and awaiting decision.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The lawsuits nationwide, which collectively represent more than 27,000 drivers, are seeking to have the former and current class members reimbursed all the expenses - including wage and other employment-related taxes - they've been forced to pay as a result of being misclassified, a liability that experts estimate exceed <span class="xn-money">$1 billion</span>.

From 2006 through 2009, Cimino manufactured and distributed pirated copies of popular business, engineering and graphic design software from several BSA member companies, including Adobe, Autodesk, Intuit, Quark, Microsoft and SolidWorks, on various Web sites including the popular auction site eBay. &#160;Cimino operated under the business name "SoftwareSuite" and advertised the sale of pirated software on various advertising forums including <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='95323329';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.buysellcommunity.com/">www.buysellcommunity.com</a> and <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='95323329';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.sell.com/">www.sell.com</a>. &#160; </p>

"The BSA is proud to work alongside the Department of Justice and others in the law enforcement community to protect the industry from those who attempt to fraudulently copy and distribute unlicensed software online." &#160;</p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The solution combines ECM, preconfigured workflows for common case types and electronic signature to create a dramatically more efficient court. &#160;Workflow sets this solution apart from others by facilitating automated and consistent processes and improving productivity across the enterprise. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"ImageSoft iJustice makes each department vastly more efficient," said <span class="xn-person">Scott Bade</span>, president of ImageSoft, Inc. &#160;"It also bridges the gaps between the courts, prosecutors and law enforcement to connect disparate systems and processes and to provide immediate improvements in law enforcement and judicial processes for enhanced constituent services." </p>

			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Key features of the solution include imaging, workflow, eFiling, dynamic case folderviewer, records management, CMS integration and TrueSign&#8482; electronic signature, which enables judges and<b> </b>attorneys<b> </b>to<b> </b>swiftly sign documents as part of the electronic workflow process. &#160;</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>ImageSoft began rolling out ImageSoft iJustice to courts and law enforcement first in <span class="xn-location">Michigan</span>, where more than 20 courts use the solution, and has since expanded across the country, including a statewide initiative in <span class="xn-location">Oregon</span>. &#160;</p>

The Circuit Court Clerk's Office, for instance, was able to catch up a backlog in filing of cases and has also enjoyed the benefit of being able to reprioritize the use of its employees."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Beyond the announcement of its ImageSoft iJustice solution, ImageSoft has also published a new white paper, <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='95308004';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.imagesoftinc.com/resources-paper-on-demand-whitepaper-signup.html">The Paper-On-Demand Court; ECM in Courts</a>, which may be downloaded free of charge at <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='95308004';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.imagesoftinc.com/">www.imagesoftinc.com</a>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Paper-on-demand is a way of thinking," said Bade. &#160;"It is a discipline that when made pervasive throughout the court enterprise, dramatic cost savings follow. &#160;ECM systems provide significant, paradigm-shifting value to courts of all types. &#160;In fact, the savings to a court are greater than any other single technology initiative."</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> The U.S. Supreme Court has added a new requirement for defense attorneys seeking to reach a plea bargain for their noncitizen clients.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"The Court's decision escalates the knowledge criminal defense attorneys must possess if they are representing noncitizens," says <span class="xn-person">Theodore J. Murphy</span>, president of Immigrare, Inc. "Basically, the possibility of deportation must be considered before accepting a plea."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>On <span class="xn-chron">March 31, 2010</span>, the Court issued a decision imposing an obligation on criminal defense attorneys to advise their noncitizen clients in criminal proceedings of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to a criminal offense. [Padilla v. <span class="xn-location">Kentucky</span>, 559 U.S. ____ (2010)]. </p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"Considering that the ground rules have changed significantly," states Murphy, "we have decided to offer free use of our service for the next 90 days. While it is not meant to take the place of legal advice from an attorney, an Immigrare.com analysis enables the user to review the particular facts and circumstances of an actual individual's case. We believe it provides the only quick and affordable on-line way to analyze individual cases in detail regarding the potential immigration consequences of plea bargains."</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Built into the Immigrare.com web tool is a model of current American immigration laws, immigration regulations, and, most importantly in this case, includes federal and state criminal statutes from all 50 states that affect immigration circumstances.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In its decision the Court said that informed consideration of possible deportation can only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants during the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deportation consequences into this process, the defense and prosecution may well be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The Court's decision pointed out that a criminal episode involving several distinct events may provide the basis for multiple charges, of which only certain ones mandate deportation following conviction. Attorneys who possess the most rudimentary understanding of the deportation consequences of a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain creatively with the prosecutor and judge. This may enable them to craft a conviction and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation. They would then avoid a conviction for an offense that automatically triggers the removal consequence.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>"We encourage criminal defense attorneys to avail themselves of the free use of our service," says Murphy. "They will then recognize how a short session on their computer can reveal the immigration consequences related to the person they represent. Having this knowledge on a printout will assist the attorney in pointing out the potential immigration consequences the client faces and provide the basis for meeting the requirements now specified by the Supreme Court."</p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> Today, in <span class="xn-location">New York</span>, the U.S. government indicted <span class="xn-person">Ken Starr</span> on charges of fraud and deception. Starr was the government's lead witness against <span class="xn-person">Wesley Snipes</span> in Snipes' trial on tax charges which is currently on appeal. In 2008, Snipes was acquitted of the major fraud charges and convicted on lesser misdemeanor charges.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>According to Bernhoft Law Partner, <span class="xn-person">Bob Barnes</span>, who defended Snipes at trial, "At Mr. Snipes' original trial we accused Starr of fraud. However, at the time, both Starr and the government claimed Starr's innocence. Considering Starr was the lead witness against Mr. Snipes and we now know he committed perjury during the trial, we think it is incumbent upon the government to dismiss all charges immediately."</p>

As reported in <i>The <span class="xn-org">New York Times</span></i>, of the four most significant criminal tax indictments brought by the government this past decade, Bernhoft Law defended three out of those four, and won all three. </p>

	        <div class="asset-body"> National Energy Group, Inc. ("NEGI" or the "Company") (Pink Sheets: NEGI) is issuing this press release in order to provide updated information concerning the continuation of its liquidation process, which commenced in <span class="xn-chron">March 2008</span> with the filing of the Company's certificate of dissolution (the "Certificate of Dissolution") with the <span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> Secretary of State but was delayed as a result of the <span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> litigation matter described below. &#160;This press release also summarizes certain historical information that has been previously published by the Company via prior press releases, Form 8-Ks and other SEC filings.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>NEGI filed its Certificate of Dissolution with the <span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> Secretary of State on <span class="xn-chron">March 25, 2008</span>. &#160;The dissolution of the Company pursuant to such filing (the "Dissolution") became effective as of <span class="xn-chron">5:00 p.m., Eastern Time</span>, on <span class="xn-chron">March 25, 2008</span>. &#160;The Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") fixed that same time and date as the final record date (the "Final Record Date") for determination of those Company stockholders entitled to receive liquidation distributions, if and when authorized by the Board, under the Company's plan of complete dissolution and liquidation (the "NEGI Liquidation Plan"). &#160;As of the Final Record Date, 11,190,650 shares of NEGI Common Stock were then outstanding. &#160;The Company's Dissolution was approved by the requisite vote of Company stockholders at a special meeting thereof held on <span class="xn-chron">March 14, 2008</span>. &#160;On that same date, the Company publicly announced the results of the special stockholders meeting, the then upcoming Final Record Date and its planned date for the filing of its Certificate of Dissolution. &#160;The Company also notified the OTC Bulletin Board Coordinator, Nasdaq Market Operations on <span class="xn-chron">March 14, 2008</span> of the then upcoming Final Record Date pursuant to applicable SEC and Nasdaq Marketplace rules. &#160;And, on <span class="xn-chron">March 26, 2008</span>, the Company submitted its Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration on Form 15 (the "Form 15") to the SEC for the purpose of deregistering its securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"). &#160;As a result of the Form 15 filing, the Company immediately suspended the filing of any further periodic reports under the 1934 Act and its status as a 1934 Act reporting company terminated within 90 days thereafter.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>As provided in the NEGI Liquidation Plan and the Certificate of Dissolution, distributions to Company stockholders pursuant to such plan, as and when made by the Company, would be in complete cancellation of all outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock. &#160;As a result, from and after the Final Record Date, and subject to applicable law, the Company's Common Stock has no longer been treated as outstanding and each holder of the Company's Common Stock as of the Final Record Date has ceased to have any rights in respect thereof, except for the right to receive distributions pursuant to and in accordance with the NEGI Liquidation Plan. &#160;Furthermore, effective as of the Final Record Date, the Company's share transfer books were closed and the Company's transfer agent was instructed by NEGI to no longer process share transfer requests.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>As a result of the stockholder derivative and class action lawsuit styled <i><span class="xn-person">Andrew T. Berger</span> v. Icahn Enterprises LP, et al.</i> (<span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> Chancery Court Case No. 3522-VCS) (now styled <i><span class="xn-person">Scott Harrington</span> v. Icahn Enterprises LP, et al.</i> following the substitution of another plaintiff) (the "Lawsuit"), and the Company's possible need to fund indemnification and expense advancement obligations to its current and former officers and directors named as defendants in the Lawsuit, the Company previously determined not to make any liquidation distributions pursuant to the NEGI Liquidation Plan until the Board determined that the Company had paid, or made adequate provision for the payment of, its liabilities and obligations, including any liabilities relating to the Lawsuit.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>The parties to the Lawsuit have agreed to a settlement (the "Delaware Settlement"), subject to approval by the Court of Chancery of the <span class="xn-location">State of Delaware</span> (the "Court"). &#160;At a hearing to be held on <span class="xn-chron">July 19, 2010</span>, at <span class="xn-chron">10:00 a.m.</span> at the <span class="xn-location">New Castle County</span> Courthouse, 500 North King Street, <span class="xn-location">Wilmington, Delaware</span> (the "Settlement Hearing"), the Court will determine, among other things, whether to approve the Delaware Settlement and to award attorney's fees to plaintiff's counsel in connection therewith. &#160;There can be no assurance with respect to whether the Court will approve the Delaware Settlement or the timing of any such approval.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>Pursuant to the order of the Court, a separate Notice of Pendency and Settlement of Action dated <span class="xn-chron">May 17, 2010</span> (the "Litigation Settlement Notice") has been mailed to interested parties by the Company (through its transfer agent) on or about <span class="xn-chron">May 27</span> and 28, 2010. &#160;This press release merely summarizes the Litigation Settlement Notice and the Delaware Settlement described therein and is not intended to provide definitive information concerning the same. &#160;Persons desiring additional information concerning the Delaware Settlement should review the Litigation Settlement Notice, which is accessible through the following Company website link: <a onclick="var s=s_gi(s_account);s.linkTrackVars='prop5,eVar3,prop15';s.prop5='External Link';s.eVar3=s.prop5;s.prop15='95130469';s.tl(this,'o','ExternalLink');" target='_blank' href="http://www.negx.com">http://www.negx.com</a>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>In summary, the Delaware Settlement provides that within five business days of the date on which the order of the Court approving such settlement becomes final and no longer subject to further appeal or review, whether by exhaustion of any possible appeal, lapse of time or otherwise, Lawsuit defendant Icahn Enterprises, L.P. ("IELP") (or its successor in interest or one of its affiliates) shall cause the sum of <span class="xn-money">$9,150,000.00</span> (the "Settlement Fund") to be deposited into an interest-bearing account designated by plaintiff's counsel. &#160;Plaintiff's counsel shall serve as the escrow agent for the Settlement Fund. &#160;Interest on the Settlement Fund shall accrue and become part of the Settlement Fund. &#160;Plaintiff's counsel shall cause (i) the amount of any legal fees and expenses awarded by the Court to be paid to plaintiff's counsel out of the Settlement Fund and (ii) the balance of the Settlement Fund (after payment of any attorneys' fees and expenses awarded by the Court, and collection of any interest payments) to be delivered to NEGI, which then shall cause such sum to be distributed promptly (through its transfer agent), <i>pro rata</i>,<i> </i>to the stockholders of record of NEGI as of the Final Record Date, including Cede &amp; Co. but excluding Lawsuit defendants IELP, <span class="xn-person">Robert G. Alexander</span>, <span class="xn-person">Jon F. Weber</span>, <span class="xn-person">Robert J. Mitchell</span>, <span class="xn-person">Jack G. Wasserman</span> and <span class="xn-person">Robert H. Kite</span>.</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 								  <p>If the Court ultimately approves the Delaware Settlement and such approval is not appealed by any interested party that has the requisite legal standing, based on presently available information (which is subject to change as circumstances warrant) and subject to final Board approval, the Company believes that the following sequence of events will apply with respect to the completion of its liquidation process pursuant to the NEGI Liquidation Plan:</p>

							 				   			  		 		
		 		 
			  				   							 							 							 							 								  									   <ul class="discStyle"  type="disc"><li>On <span class="xn-chron">July 19, 2010</span>, the Court will conduct the Settlement Hearing on the Delaware Settlement. &#160;NEGI will issue a supplemental press release concerning the Court's decision regarding the Delaware Settlement promptly upon NEGI's receipt of such information.</li><li>If the Court approves the Delaware Settlement (the "Initial Court Approval") and the Initial Court Approval is not appealed by a party with the requisite legal standing, then on or about the 30th calendar day following the Initial Court Approval, the Court's approval of the Delaware Settlement will become final and non-appealable (the "Final Court Approval Date"). &#160;</li><li>On or before the 5th business day following the Final Court Approval Date, IELP will deposit the Settlement Fund with plaintiff's counsel who, after payment of legal fees and expenses awarded by the Court, will then promptly remit the then remaining balance of the Settlement Fund (including any interest earned thereon) to NEGI.</li><li>Within 5 business days following NEGI's receipt of the then remaining amount of the Settlement Fund from plaintiff's counsel, NEGI (through its transfer agent) will then distribute such Settlement Fund amount via U.S. Mail, <i>pro rata</i>,<i> </i>to the stockholders of record of NEGI as of the Final Record Date, including Cede &amp;Co. but excluding Lawsuit defendants IELP, <span class="xn-person">Robert G. Alexander</span>, <span class="xn-person">Jon F. Weber</span>, <span class="xn-person">Robert J. Mitchell</span>, <span class="xn-person">Jack G. Wasserman</span> and <span class="xn-person">Robert H. Kite</span>.</li><li>Within 30 calendar days following NEGI's distribution of the above-noted Settlement Fund amount, NEGI (through its transfer agent) intends to then effect via U.S. Mail, in connection with the Dissolution of the Company pursuant to the NEGI Liquidation Plan, a final liquidation distribution, <i>pro rata</i>,<i> </i>to the stockholders of record of NEGI as of the Final Record Date, including Cede &amp;Co. and also including Lawsuit defendants IELP, <span class="xn-person">Robert G.

Wasserman</span> and <span class="xn-person">Robert H. Kite</span>. &#160;NEGI will issue a supplemental press release concerning the anticipated aggregate dollar amount of such liquidation distribution at the same time that it announces the decision of the Court regarding the Delaware Settlement. </li></ul><br/>
