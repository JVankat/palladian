The American League was the brainchild of Ban Johnson, the president of the Western 
League, which was the strongest minor league in the 1890s. It was upgraded by Johnson 
and former major leaguer Charles Comiskey, the owner of the St. Paul franchise. By 
1900 it was renamed the <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=American_League">American League</A>, and in 1901 it went into open competition 
with the <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=National_League">National League</A>, the only other major league at the time. Comiskey moved 
the St. Paul club to Chicago, and the new league also competed with the NL head-on 
in Boston and Philadelphia; the other franchises were in Detroit, Milwaukee, Cleveland, 
Baltimore, and Washington.

<p>Johnson stocked his new league with major league players 
by starting a bidding war for their services, ignoring the reserve clause in the 
NL contracts. The low salaries paid by NL clubs, enforced with a $2,400 salary maximum, 
made it easy to lure stars such as <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Cy_Young_1867">Cy Young</A>,
John McGraw, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Willie_Keeler_1872">Willie Keeler</A>, Napoleon 
Lajoie, Ed Delahanty, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Jesse_Burkett_1868">Jesse Burkett</A>, and others. <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Connie_Mack_1862">Connie Mack</A> signed Lajoie for the 
<A HREF="../teams/team.php?team=philadelphia_athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</A> by offering him a $6,000 contract, and Lajoie won the Triple 
Crown with 14 HR, 125 RBI, and a tremendous .422 average (still the AL record). When 
a Pennsylvania court ruled that Lajoie had to return to the Phillies, Johnson convinced 
Mack to transfer the highly desirable star to the Cleveland franchise to keep him 
in the AL. For a while, Lajoie did not accompany the team on trips to Philadelphia, 
a small consolation to Mack. This kind of owner solidarity helped the young league 
survive the war with the senior circuit, although it certainly helped that the AL 
outdrew the NL in all three cities in which they both competed in 1901. The Milwaukee 
franchise moved to St. Louis for 1902 and, now competing in four cities, the AL once 
again outdrew the NL in head-to-head competition; overall attendance for the eight-team 
league was 2,228,000 in a 136-game schedule compared to the NL's 1,684,000.<p>After 
the 1902 season, there was a peace settlement between the two leagues; the NL sought 
a merger, but Johnson knew he had the upper hand, and held out for full acceptance 
by the NL. The only concession the AL had to make was to promise not to place a franchise 
in Pittsburgh; they did move the Baltimore club to New York, they were allowed to 
keep all the players they had taken from the NL, and the AL reserve clauses were 
to be respected. The American League based its popularity on its contrast to the 
rowdyism of the <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=National_League">National League</A>, with Johnson especially noted for his strong support 
of the league's umpires. In the NL an arbiter's authority depended largely on his 
own presence (which is how <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Bill_Klem">Bill Klem</A> became famous), but Johnson stood behind all 
of his umpires and tolerated very little abuse of them by players or managers. This 
was a major element in <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=John_McGraw_1873">John McGraw</A>'s decision to move to the NL's New York franchise, 
and McGraw tried to block the AL's move of the Baltimore club to New York. The bad 
feelings between McGraw and Johnson led to another conflict the next year. The revival 
of the two-league concept allowed the resumption of postseason play in 1903 with 
the inaugural <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=World_Series">World Series</A>, won by the Boston Pilgrims over the Pirates, but when 
McGraw's Giants won in 1904, he refused to play the Pilgrims. He did deign to meet 
Mack's Athletics in 1905, and the Series has continued uninterrupted ever since, 
as has the peace between the two leagues.<p>The profitable American League expanded 
its schedule to 154 games in 1904. It had good luck in attracting young talent that 
turned out to be of superstar caliber. <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Ty_Cobb_1886">Ty Cobb</A>, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Ed Walsh, Addie 
Joss, Tris Speaker, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Walter_Johnson_1887">Walter Johnson</A>, and most of all <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Babe_Ruth_1895">Babe Ruth</A> brought the AL more 
publicity, and helped the junior circuit win twice as many <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=World_Series">World Series</A> as the NL 
through 1918.<p>In 1919 the Black Sox scandal rocked the game as key members of the 
seemingly invincible White Sox threw the WS to the Reds for payoffs from gamblers. 
The AL's antidote was the legendary <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Babe_Ruth_1895">Babe Ruth</A>. He had set what many considered to 
be an unbreakable record in 1919 by hitting 29 HR for Boston (19 ahead of the runners-up). 
After being sold to the Yankees for the 1920 season, Ruth benefited from several 
changes regarding the ball: it was livelier, it was cleaner (the spitball was outlawed), 
and it wasn't kept in play until it was falling
apart. Ruth hit an unprecedented 
54 HR in 1920 with his then unorthodox (and later much-copied) uppercut swing, and 
he proved to be quite a gate attraction. League attendance was over five million, 
more than a million and a half above the previous high and a million better than 
the NL total. Ruth's 54 HR was 35 ahead of runner-up <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=George_Sisler_1893">George Sisler</A>, but Ken Williams 
adopted the new strategy and soon he, Bob Meusel, Al Simmons, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Lou_Gehrig_1903">Lou Gehrig</A>, and Joe 
Hauser were breaking the 20-HR barrier as Ruth set a new standard with 60 HR in 1927. 
When the next generation came along in the 1930s with the new style as a normal part 
of their repertoire, stars like Jimmie Foxx, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Earl_Averill_1902">Earl Averill</A>, Hank Greenberg, Indian 
Bob Johnson, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Joe_DiMaggio_1914">Joe DiMaggio</A>, Hal Trosky, and Rudy York hit 30 HR regularly, occasionally 
challenged Ruth's record, and enabled the AL to dominate in the early years of the 
All-Star Game.<p>Ban Johnson continued as the autocrat of the American League until 
1927, but his control over all of baseball slipped after the Black Sox scandal led 
to the appointment of Judge Landis to the new office of Commissioner. The peace settlement 
back in 1903 had included the founding of the <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=National_Commission">National Commission</A>, a triumvirate 
composed of the AL and NL presidents and Cincinnati owner <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Garry_Herrmann">Garry Herrmann</A> that decided 
disputes between clubs and between clubs and players. Johnson had been able to dominate 
this board, but met his match in Landis. It didn't help that the scandal also precipitated 
a break between Johnson and Comiskey. Johnson resigned when it became apparent to 
him that he was never going to remedy the situation. <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Ernest_S_Barnard">Ernest S. Barnard</A> became AL 
president, but he died in 1931 and was succeeded by <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Will_Harridge">Will Harridge</A>, who lasted a record 
28 years.<p>Meanwhile, the Yankee dynasty that Ruth had started shared power with 
such mini-dynasties as the Senators (1924-25, '33), the Athletics (1929-31), and 
the Tigers (1934-35); New York won 14 AL pennants between 1921 and 1943. The Yankees 
also won the <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=World_Series">World Series</A> ten times in that period; four additional AL victories 
added to American League domination of the postseason. In the tradition of Ruth, 
the AL was a hitters' league, and offense drew in the fans in numbers the NL couldn't 
match. In Boston, owner Tom Yawkey and general manager <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Eddie_Collins_1887">Eddie Collins</A> paid dearly 
for West Coast stars <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Ted_Williams_1918">Ted Williams</A> and <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Bobby_Doerr_1918">Bobby Doerr</A>, and the Red Sox became respectable 
for the first time since <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Harry_Frazee">Harry Frazee</A> had sold off Ruth and others to pay the debts 
on his Broadway shows. But the two Hall of Famers brought Boston only one pennant 
(1946).<p>Yankee hegemony reached its peak after the war: from 1947 to 1964 they 
won fifteen AL pennants and ten <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=World_Series">World Series</A>, including a record five straight under 
manager <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Casey_Stengel_1890">Casey Stengel</A> (1949-53). This new Yankee dynasty was built around Mickey 
Mantle, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Yogi_Berra_1925">Yogi Berra</A>, and Whitey Ford and featured strength at every position and the 
solid pitching of the "Big Three": Allie Reynolds, Vic Raschi, and <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Ed_Lopat_1918">Ed Lopat</A>. GM Ed 
Barrow and farm director <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=George_Weiss">George Weiss</A> had put together the AL's best minor league 
system, and the dynasty seemed self-perpetuating. <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Al_Lopez_1908">Al Lopez</A> was elected to the Hall 
of Fame as a manager largely on the strength of being the only manager to take the 
flag away from New York in the 1950s, winning in 1954 and 1959. Managing Cleveland 
from 1951 to 1956 and Chicago starting in 1957, he finished second every other year 
in the decade.<p>The first AL franchise move in 50
years came when the St. Louis 
Browns moved to Baltimore for the 1954 season. Harridge's reign ended in 1959, and 
former All-Star <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Joe_Cronin_1906">Joe Cronin</A> succeeded him as AL president. The 1960s brought more 
change, and (eventually) the end of the Yankee dynasty. The AL jumped the gun on 
expansion to get a California franchise (the Los Angeles Angels) and to let Calvin 
Griffith get out of Washington. Griffith's original Senators became the Minnesota 
Twins and a new franchise took their place in Washington. The ten-team structure 
required a 162-game schedule, which instantly led to controversy. <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Roger_Maris_1934">Roger Maris</A>, having 
adapted his swing to the short right-field porch at <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Yankee_Stadium">Yankee Stadium</A>, hit 61 HR in 
1961 to break Ruth's season record. But Ruth had hit 60 in only 154 games. Commissioner 
<A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Ford_Frick">Ford Frick</A>, a former ghostwriter and drinking buddy of Ruth's, ruled that Maris had 
to match or set the record in the same 154 games; after that span of time, Maris 
had 59 HR. The infamous asterisk that Frick placed next to Maris's record was later 
overturned by the rules committee.<p>The biggest change in baseball was not the length 
of the schedule or the location of the franchises. In 1962 the Player Development 
Plan was adopted to deal with the troubled minor leagues, which had been losing money 
and teams for years. A plan to distribute the talent to stock the minors (and eventually, 
of course, the majors too) followed in 1965 with the introduction of the annual free-agent 
draft. The Yankee franchise had already developed the problems that would bring it 
crashing down to last place in 1966 after a sixth-place finish in 1965, but their 
inability to buy up all the young talent in the future doomed them to a lengthy stretch 
of mediocrity. The Yankee collapse ended the last vestiges of AL dominance. New York 
had lost the last two <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=World_Series">World Series</A>, and the NL was winning the <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=All-Star_Game">All-Star Game</A> almost 
every year; AL teams had been slower than their NL counterparts to sign up minority 
talent, and the imbalance was great. AL attendance dropped off radically in 1965. 
As the Yankees lost their attraction, the NL drew five million more fans than the 
AL.<p>Baltimore became the new league dynasty thanks to their fine farm system and 
to the wise acquisition of <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Frank_Robinson_1935">Frank Robinson</A> from the NL's Reds. Robinson won the Triple 
Crown in his first AL season (1966) and led the Orioles to their first-ever World 
Championship, something their precursors, the Browns, had never won. Baltimore became 
truly dominant after the second expansion in 1969, when the 12-team league was split 
into two divisions. They won three straight AL flags (1969-71), with division titles 
in 1973-74, and added another AL pennant in 1979.<p>The move to divisional play was 
an effort to get around the problem of too many losers each season. With two divisions 
in each league, more teams could contend, and do so later in the season. The newly 
minted Pilots lasted just one season in Seattle, moving to Milwaukee in 1970. The 
<A HREF="../teams/team.php?team=kansas_city_royals">Kansas City Royals</A>, better judges of young talent, became a Western Division dynasty 
later in the decade. Kansas City was available for an expansion franchise because 
Charlie Finley, the maverick owner of the Athletics (whom he rechristened the A's), 
had moved his team to Oakland in 1968 in an effort to duplicate the attendance success 
of the Dodgers, Giants, and Angels on the West Coast. He failed at that, but he succeeded 
in building one of the most exciting teams in the league.
Based on the superstar 
talents of <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Catfish_Hunter_1946">Catfish Hunter</A>, <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Vida_Blue_1949">Vida Blue</A>, Reggie Jackson, and Rollie Fingers, the team 
won five consecutive division titles (1971-75) and three straight World Championships 
(1972-74) and led the league each year in clubhouse vendettas and player-owner squabbles. 
Just to make sure they got attention, Finley literally changed the face of baseball 
by offering them rewards for growing mustaches, and also outfitted them in a variety 
of green, gold, and white uniforms.<p>Meanwhile, the league dealt with continuing 
attendance problems by approving a radical rule change, the designated hitter (DH). 
Allowing another player to bat for the pitcher perked up offense and attendance. 
This step was taken in the last year of <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Joe_Cronin_1906">Joe Cronin</A>'s administration. In 1974 Lee 
McPhail (the son of former owner Larry McPhail) took over the AL presidency.<p>What 
broke up the A's, and revived the fortunes of the Yankees, was the advent of free 
agency. Hunter showed the shape of things to come when he became a free agent after 
Finley reneged on part of his contract. <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=George_Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</A>, the New York owner, 
acquired Hunter's services with an unheard-of $3.5-million-dollar, five-year contract 
in 1975. Pitchers <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Andy_Messersmith_1945">Andy Messersmith</A> and <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Dave_McNally_1942">Dave McNally</A> challenged the reserve clause 
that year and won. Thereafter, players could, with varying restrictions, sell their 
services to the highest bidder after fulfilling certain requirements as to length 
of service. Finley's players hated him and seized the chance to escape. Finley saw 
trouble coming and traded or sold his best players when he could. Jackson and Ken 
Holtzman were traded to Baltimore for <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Don_Baylor_1949">Don Baylor</A> and Mike Torrez (although Finley 
was unable to hang onto Baylor and traded Torrez to the Yankees after less than two 
seasons). The sales of Joe Rudi and Rollie Fingers to the Red Sox and <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Vida_Blue_1949">Vida Blue</A> to 
the Yankees, for a million dollars each, were voided by Commissioner <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Bowie_Kuhn_1926">Bowie Kuhn</A> "in 
the best interests of baseball."<p>The Yankees, besides signing many former A's - 
in addition to Hunter in 1975, they got Jackson and <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Ken_Holtzman_1945">Ken Holtzman</A> for 1977 - assumed 
the characteristics of those Oakland teams: internecine feuding ameliorated by common 
opposition to the owner. They also had the success typical of the A's, winning three 
straight league titles (1976-78) and two <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=World_Series">World Series</A> (1977-78). At the end of the 
1980s, they were still the last team to repeat as World Champions.<p>Free agency 
is seen as a major factor in the new era of parity, with almost every team winning 
at least one division title, the exceptions in the AL being Cleveland and Texas. 
The Texas franchise has largely continued the losing tradition of its ancestors, 
the Senators. The team moved to Arlington, Texas after the 1971 season, bringing 
about a league realignment, with Milwaukee and Texas switching divisions. But the 
biggest change came in 1977, when the AL expanded again (this time without corresponding 
expansion by the NL). The addition of the Toronto Blue Jays and <A HREF="../teams/team.php?team=seattle_mariners">Seattle Mariners</A> 
gave the AL 14 teams, and it adopted a much-criticized balanced schedule that resulted 
in each team playing more games outside its division than within it. At the time, 
the Western Division was considerably weaker than the East, and the Western clubs 
wanted more home dates against the East's more established and better-drawing teams.<p>Interest 
in baseball boomed after the 1977 expansion, linked by many observers to the
fact 
that almost every team had a turn at winning (the Mariners joined Texas and Seattle 
as the have-nots, but Toronto won its division in 1985). Dr. <A HREF="../ballplayers/player.php?name=Bobby_Brown_1924">Bobby Brown</A>, a former 
Yankee star and former part-owner of the Texas club, succeeded McPhail as AL president 
in 1984.
