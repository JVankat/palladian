<p>Released in 1991 at a list price of $399, the SR-16 was a
sample playback drum machine that gave new meaning to the
expression 'bang for the buck.' The machine featured the
following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>memory for 100 preset patterns and 100 preset fills (not
        erasable which is disappointing), 100 user writable
        patterns and writable fills. Patterns are then linked in
        song mode to create a song with up to 254 patterns per
        song and the ability to store 100 songs. 50 preset kits
        (non erasable) and 50 user defined kits.</li>
    <li>1 meg of samples of drum sounds.</li>
    <li>96 ppq resolution.</li>
    <li>velocity sensitive pads and the ability to recognize
        velocity data. </li>
    <li>step programming.</li>
    <li>L/R main outputs and auxiliary outputs. Start/Stop and
        fill footswitch input jacks (all ï¿½ jacks). Cassette tape
        in/out jacks (mini phone <strong>j</strong>acks
        -urghh!!!) MIDI in and out/thru.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sounds / Creating Drum Sets</strong></p>

<p>Each of the SR16&#146;s 12 pad can be assigned to any of the
233 drum sounds included with the unit, with different volume
levels (8 when using the internal sequencer, about 20 different
levels when responding to incoming midi velocity data), tunings
(only 7 available though), triggering mode (single, multi, group)
and choice of routing the sound to the main or auxiliary outputs
for each pad. All of these pad parameters are used to create a
drum set up. The unit comes with 50 programmed drum kits in ROM
(non erasable) and 50 user defined kits in RAM. </p>

<p>As indicated above the unit comes with 233 drum sounds broken
into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>49 kicks</li>
    <li>59 snares</li>
    <li>19 hi-hats</li>
    <li>12 cymbals</li>
    <li>42 other (various percussion including timbales, shaker,
        triangle, congas, tambourine, etc..)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the sounds are in stereo and include effect processing
which was recorded as part of the original sample since the unit
does not have any on-board effect processing. Certain sounds are
made of a single samples and other sounds are made up of up to
three samples. This layering of samples becomes more common when
a sound is set to play at the maximum velocity level which
results in some extra punch to the sound. This results in a more
life-like sounding kit since as with a real drum kit since the
harder the stick hits the drum the more &#145;punch&#146; the
sound will have. The only draw back is that the unit can only
play sixteen voices at a time and each sample uses one voice so
at times you might be able to fire a maximum of 5 sounds at a
time. Unfortunately there no sound editing parameter so what you
hear is what you get which is a shame but was clearly done to get
this machine to market at a list price of under $400. However
what you do hear sounds very good. A lot of the sounds are very
life like and unfortunately there are minimal electronic type
sounds. Also the sounds might be a little dated as these sounds
have been available since 1991 when the unit went on the market
and Alesis is still selling the unit. </p>

<p><strong>Creating Patterns</strong></p>

<p>Patterns can be anywhere from 1 - 128 beats long and offer
resolution of 96 ppq. Quantization can be adjusted from off up to
a quarter note (1ppq). Recording can be performed in real time
where the machine will play a pattern over and over and the
events are triggered by taping the applicable pad or via midi.
The unit also offers a very nice step mode which allows you to
step through pattern with the steps size equal to the set
quantization level. In step mode you can enter and remove notes
and adjust the velocity of a note. One of the most interesting
features is the ability to add of subtract beats from the end of
beginning of a pattern. The unit also allows you to shift the
sound of a single drum that has been entered into a pattern
forward or backwards by as many clocks as you would like. Drum
parts entered after the offset has been entered will not be
affected which is the way offset should work so every note of a
particular sound in a pattern does not have to been affected by
the offset. Each pattern may be named using up to seven
characters. Each pattern is assigned a particular drum kit and so
only 12 different sounds may be used in a pattern. </p>

<p>The unit can remember 100 &#145;main&#146; patterns and each
pattern has a corresponding &#145;fill pattern. So in essence the
unit can remember 200 patterns, however fills are not as flexible
as main patterns but offer a unique feature. Each fill is
associated with a main pattern. A fill uses the same drum set and
is the same length as its related main pattern. Additionally a
fill does not have its own downbeat but uses its downbeat data as
a substitute to the next patterns downbeat data. This is a really
smart feature that allows for the following: Let say your playing
a fill and wish to have cymbal crash on the downbeat of the next
pattern. The crash is more related to the fill than the new
pattern you would probably be more interested in hearing a crash
after a drum fill than at the start of the pattern if a fill
hadn&#146;t been played. Since the fill will play its downbeat
data at the beginning of the next pattern you do not have the
cymbal crash repeat every time main pattern plays. </p>

<p><strong>Song Mode</strong></p>

<p>Pattern mode offers some really great features and song mode
unfortunately omits some great features. A song is a listening of
the and the order of up to 254 patterns which comprise a song. So
once you have played through 254 patterns of a song the unit will
stop playing since there is no way to link songs which is a
shame. The unit will remember up to 100 songs. Song tempo may be
set from 20-255 beats per minute and may be changes as the song
is playing but there is not way to store a tempo change as part
of the song. Songs may be created in real time or manually by
entering the patterns. You may identify the step which a main
pattern switches to a fill pattern in real time or by entering
the specific step in manual mode. You can insert a step between
existing steps, delete a step or replace a step. You can copy a
song to itself and thus double it and copy a song to a new song.
What you cant do is identify a group of steps (i.e. steps 40-50 -
the chorus after the first verse) and identify a step where they
should be inserted (i.e. step 90 -chorus after the second verse).
You may start a song at any step, however to identify the step
you have to use the incr/decr keys to scroll to the applicable
step. You should be able to enter the specific step using the 10
digit keypad but you can&#146;t. This is very frustrating and
will cause you to waste precious time scrolling to particular
points. </p>

<p><strong>Midi Implementation</strong></p>

<p>The SR-16 has a really solid midi implementation which offers
the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The ability to operate in omni or poly mode and when in
        poly mode any channel from 1-16 may be selected. </li>
    <li>The ability to use the SR-16 as a sound module and have
        its sounds triggered from an external controller.</li>
    <li>The ability to use the SR-16 to trigger other modules and
        to select what midi # will be sent from each drum pad or
        when playing a pattern or song. Unfortunately this
        feature is global. What would have been great is if this
        data was part of a drum set and therefore you could store
        50 different options. </li>
    <li>The ability to sync to incoming midi timing signals.</li>
    <li>The ability to echo back out (through the midi out port)
        the midi data the SR-16 receives from its midi in port.
        Or said another way it will create a thru/out port. </li>
    <li>System exclusive dump of its entire memory contents.
        Excellent. Memory contents may be saved to tape as well. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<p>The unit offers swing percentages of 54%, 58% and 62% of the
current quantization setting. You can change the swing percentage
or quantization without leaving record mode and the notes that
have already been recorded will stay where you put them. </p>

<p>You can clear the units memory by holding down play and erase
buttons (for three seconds) while turning on the power. You can
check the software version by pressing the fill button any time
your in the back up menu. I have version 1.07 and do not know
what the differences are between the version but if you know
about the differences please e-mail me. </p>

<p>The user interface is pretty good with a nice size easy to
read display with logical menus and a large cool looking volume
knob. Of course the knob is the only thing to ever break on my
unit and now when I move the knob I get some static and some
strange volume changes (so I always leave mine on full). My
biggest gripe about the display is that there is no way to see
the contents of an entire pattern and at most you can see one
event at a time in step mode. Something like a &#145;Roland&#146;
style grid (even if you could only see four beats at a time)
would have been nice. The buttons are a tad on the small side but
still easy to work with. The pads are also small although bigger
than the buttons. However, in my opinion, they are too small to
realistically record patterns without the need to do some clean
up in step mode. And since the unit is so small and (9 1/8&quot;
X 6 ï¿½&quot; X 1-3/4&quot; weighing 2 pounds) it moves around as
you try to play the pads. You may wish to stick the unit to
something so it doesn&#146;t move around which is what I did. The
manual is well written and overall the unit is very easy to use. </p>

<p>Its interesting to mention that I bought an SR-16 in 1992
since at the time I only had a TR909 and was looking for some
more realistic drum sounds. I have been using the SR-16 since and
overall I think its a good machine with my biggest complaint
being the lack of programmability of the sounds followed closely
by the inability to directly enter a song position. </p>
