<p>Earlier in the week, <a href="http://www.thenolookpass.com/2011/05/09/where-do-the-lakers-go-from-here/"  target="_blank">Rey wrote a piece</a> stating that the Lakers should stand pat, add a piece or two and make another run for the chip. And while that's logical thinking, it begs the question - are the Lakers, in their current state, still title contenders?</p>
<p>There's no doubt they're still a very good team - they're a perennial playoff team, pacific division winner, and top 4 seed. But is that enough for Laker fans? Will they be content with another 3rd seed and 2nd or 3rd round knockout? While most teams and their fanbases(Clippers included) would love to be in that "predicament", the Lakers franchise holds a higher standard. It's always been win it all or it'd be considered a failure.</p>
<p>Let's face it, this team is not getting any younger. Kobe turns 33 in August, Lamar Odom and Ron Artest turn 32 in November, Pau Gasol turns 31 in July, and Derek Fisher is from the Mesozoic era. Bynum is the only youth they have in the lineup. And if they're locked out for the entire 2011-12 season, these guys will all be a year older in 2012-13. Taking all of this into account, is it ludicrous to believe a rebuild may be in the team's best interest?</p>
<p>It's obvious there are four guys on this team with trade value - Kobe, Odom, Bynum and Gasol. Scouring the 29 other teams, there are potential suitors that can make this team younger and competitive at the same time. I used the<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine']);" target="_blank"> ESPN trade machine</a> to come up with these trades. As unrealistic as some may be, I will explain to you why they make sense for both parties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kobe Bryant, Ron Artest and Derek Fisher to the New York Knicks in exchange for Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups</strong> - The Lakers receive a 27 year old scoring machine. He doesn't play much defense, but surround him with a much better defensive lineup(a la Denver) and he and the team will flourish. Unloading Artest and Fisher's terrible contracts is the icing on the cake. The Knicks get one of the greatest players of all time in the mecca of basketball. The fans will embrace him as he will embrace playing for them on the biggest stage in the NBA. Plus it makes the Knicks a better team overall.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrew Bynum and Lamar Odom to the Orlando Magic for Dwight Howard and Ryan Anderson</strong> - The rumors surrounding Howard has grown louder by the day. Who knows how he really feels about playing in Orlando. BUT...if the opportunity to acquire him become available, the Lakers should jump all over this. Laker fans have practically been declaring Superman as their next great center in 2012, and if they were by some miracle to achieve this, they'd be set. Ryan Anderson is also a young big who can hit the outside shot. If the Magic KNEW they were going to lose Dwight, nabbing Bynum and Odom isn't a bad consolation prize. A 23 year old center with All-Star potential and a versatile forward is something they could definitely use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pau Gasol and Steve Blake to the San Antonio Spurs for Tony Parker, Antonio McDyess and James Anderson</strong> - Even though Gasol floundered in the playoffs, he is still one of the most skilled big men in the NBA. With Tim Duncan being on his last legs, the Spurs need a replacement down low. Gasol is four years younger. Plus George Hill looks to be the Spurs PG of the future. The Lakers get a real PG for the first time since Nick Van Exel, a position they've sorely needed to rectify. Parker is still only 28, McDyess is an expiring unguaranteed contract and James Anderson is a 1st round talent who could blossom. Plus they dump Steve Blake, who had a subpar season.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lakers save about 10M for next season alone, but more importantly, they shed the contracts of Blake, Fisher, and Artest. They will save 32M in 2012-13, giving them more flexiblity to acquire young talent. This is not even taking into account any draft picks the Lakers may receive.</p>
<p>Now, how far can you go with Howard, Melo and Parker as your centerpieces? Who knows, but why not take a chance? You have the best center and defensive player of the year in Howard, arguably the best pure scorer in the league in Melo and an All-Star caliber point guard in Parker. They will still be a good playoff team and depending who they surround the big three with(via free agency or draft), they can go even further. Also, Chauncey Billups teams up with Parker to gives them a pretty good PG duo.  I'm pretty sure I will catch heat for these off the wall scenarios, but IMO, the team needs a change. This allows them to get younger, have more cap flexbility, which could be even more valuable with the uncertainty of the new CBA, and potential free agents would want to join them. Look, the Lakers are a proud franchise that has proven time and time again they can rebuild quickly. It only took them three seasons to rebuild after Magic retired and after Shaq was traded. But alas, none of this will probably ever happen, however the fantasy NBA nerd in me is in full effect. Thoughts?</p>

<p>If you follow the NBA, you know it's a weird time. The <b>Los Angeles Lakers</b> are no longer in the playoffs. Heck, they were the first team eliminated from the <b>conference semi-finals</b>. </p>
<p>They just looked <b>spent</b>. Too many mental lapses. Especially the core. <b>Kobe Bryant</b> wasn't driving to the basket much. <b>Pau Gasol</b> (with all the rumors flying around) was in an extended slump. <b>Lamar Odom</b> was back to his inconsistent ways. The bench wasn't producing as well. Only <b>Andrew Bynum</b> seemed to bring it and, even then, his swatting of <b>J.J. Barea</b> at the end of the game was just plain <b>stupid</b>. It was the perfect storm for their opponents, the <b>Dallas Mavericks</B>, who have become the team that their fans expected them to be. </p>
<p>But where do the Lakers go from here? Most Laker fans are clamoring for <b>Chris Paul</b> and <b>Dwight Howard</b>. And I love how most of 'em are making their own trades such as trading <b>Luke Walton</b> for <b>Dwight Howard</b>. </p>
<p>Sorry. Trades don't work that way. First off, what makes them think that they would JUST agree to trading their franchise player away? Second, there are also salary cap rules; teams can't just ask for a maximum deal guy and trade away a guy who's making <b>$5 million</b>. Third, have you SEEN the Lakers' salaries?! Plus it's hard to do anything with the <B>CBA</b> changes coming up.</p>
<p>But do I agree with <b>Magic Johnson</b> saying that he should <b>blow the team up</b>? No. There's no need for that. They can keep this core and I'm fine with it although if the Lakers chose to trade one of their core members for a nice, big return (Bynum for Howard)... then I'm okay with that. This is still a championship roster and they have a few good years left. Kobe is <b>32 years old</b> and if he heals up, he can still be one of the best in the league. Pau is only <b>30</b> and I'm sure he can go back to that <b>19</b> and <b>10</b> guy he's been for all of his career. Lamar is still only <b>31</b> and even though he's had his lapses, he has showed no signs of slowing down. <b>Ron Artest</b> is <b>31</b> and he's still a one-on-one defensive nightmare. And, of course, there's Bynum, who is only <b>23</b>. He still hasn't played a full season since <b>2007</b>... but he's showed how dependable he can be when he's getting the ball inside. </p>
<p>If anything, maybe it's the bench that needs a little upgrading. <b>Matt Barnes</b> was not the same after his injury. <b>Shannon Brown</b> only played well in the first month of the season. <b>Steve Blake</b> hasn't fully adjusted to the offense and, at times, looked tentative shooting. I love how fans suddenly clamored for <b>Jordan Farmar</b> and <b>Sasha Vujacic</b>.</p>
<p>And then there's <b>Derek Fisher</b>. He'll hit the big shot once in a while but it's no secret how vulnerable he is defensively. Maybe he can still provide a good <b>10-15 minutes</b> but as a <b>27-30 minute</b> player? That's been done for a few years. </p>
<p>Barnes and Brown have player options so they can return if they choose to. Otherwise, all the players I mentioned (plus <b>Luke Walton</b>) are contracted to the Lakers next year (most of them are contracted for, at least, two years).</p>
<p>And we can't forget about <b>Phil Jackson</b>. It wasn't the greatest way to send him out but what a coaching career he had. Whoever's following him is going to have a monumental task. A lot of signs are pointing to <b>Brian Shaw</b>, which is I'm sure what Kobe wants outside of Duke's <b>Coach K</b>.</p>
<p>If the Lakers are in a need of an upgrade, it's more at point guard than at center. But remember that both <b>Orlando</b> and <b>New Orleans</b> will do everything in their power (i.e. NOT trade them) to keep their franchise players. Also remember that these guys are NOT free until the end of NEXT season. It's not a secret that Howard wants to be a Laker. It's also NOT a secret that <b>Jim Buss</b> (son of <b>Jerry Buss</b>) LOVES Andrew Bynum. </p>
<p>What do I expect to see?</p>
<p>I'll be mildly surprised if one of their core players get moved, especially since their salaries are so hard to move. Check how much they're making next season (courtesy of <a href="http://shamsports.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/shamsports.com']);"><b>ShamSports.Com</b></a>).</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant: $25 million.<br />
Pau Gasol: Nearly $19 million.<br />
Andrew Bynum: Nearly $15 million.<br />
Lamar Odom: Nearly $9 million.<br />
Ron Artest: Nearly $7 million.</p>
<p>If I wanted to move someone, it'd be Bynum for Howard. That's it. Find me someone who's as versatile as Lamar Odom (outside of, say, <b>LeBron James</b>). Find me someone who is as skilled as Pau Gasol. And you'd be foolish to move Pau for another center. What? You're going to get Bynum or that center to play power forward? Yeah, like that's gonna fly. As far as point guards go, though? I don't think the Lakers want to give away one of their big guys (which is a strength of theirs) for a point guard. </p>
<p>With a few tweaks on the bench and plenty of rest, the Lakers should be challenging for their third championship in four years next season. And Laker fans should put away their pipe dream of acquiring Howard or CP3 for another season or so because I doubt any of that is going to happen. </p>
<p>But, hey, stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>Like the Lakers getting eliminated early in the playoffs.</p>

<p>My, my. Where to begin?</p>
<p>It's kind of a weird time for the <b>Lakers</b> and the fans (real or bandwagon). When was the last time the Lakers were down <b>0-2</b> in a series? That's right. <b>2008</b> against the <b>Celtics</b> (hello, <b>Boston</b>). It's been a while.</p>
<p>Like the Lakers seem to be doing, fans are pointing fingers on who to blame it on. </p>
<p>But there isn't just one problem. There are tons.</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL</font></b></p>
<p>This was the wrong time to do something like this.</p>
<p>The Lakers were pretty much ready to put the game away in <b>Game 1</b>. The Mavericks were losing their composure, Lakers were hitting shots from all angles, and L.A. was up <b>16</b> in the third quarter.</p>
<p>But when the opponent is down, they should've kicked them some more while they were down. You can't let a team as good as the Mavs hang around on a close game because that win can be stolen under you. When a team is up 16, they should be thinking of putting themselves up 20... then thinking of putting themselves up 25. </p>
<p>Lakers blew the game and then unraveled in the next game. The Mavs never took their foot off the gas pedal. And that's why they're up 2-0.</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">BOMBS AWAY</font></b></p>
<p>The Lakers are not a good outside shooting team. They finished <b>18th</b> in <b>three-point shooting</b> (<b>35.2 percent</b>). They were <b>5/19</b> in the first game and <b>2/20</b> in <b>Game 2</b> (missed their <b>first 15</b>). What was frustrating for most of Game 2 was that the three-point shot seemed to be their first option on a lot of possessions. They need to know their strengths and it's a damn shame when the Lakers supposedly have a high basketball IQ and they're not playing smart. According to <b><a href="http://espnlosangeles.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/espnlosangeles.com']);">ESPN L.A.</a></b>'s <b>Dave McMenamin</b>, <b>Andrew Bynum only got three touches</b> outside of offensive boards in the second half. REALLY?!</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">PICK AND ROLL DEFENSE</font></b></p>
<p>Atrocious, as <b>Kobe Bryant</b> mentioned.</p>
<p>It could be <b>Jason Kidd</b> to <b>Dirk Nowitzki</b> for a pick-and-pop. Kidd to <b>Jason Terry</b>. <b>J.J. Barea</b> (can someone stop that man?) to Dirk. <b>Shawn Marion</b> to <b>Tyson Chandler</b>. It took them a long time to figure it out in <b>Game 2</b> but by then, it was too late. </p>
<p>Hey, Lakers. Try going under the pick. It might work!</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">PAU GASOL</font></b> </p>
<p>I haven't seen him this overmatched since that series against the Celtics I brought up in '08. He looked tentative. He looked scared. And when his shots weren't falling, he looked, well, sad. If anything, he hasn't looked like himself in this postseason; his performance is more magnified because they're down, 0-2. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/2011Playoffs/LakerPanic002.jpg"></p>
<p>Gasol is only averaging <b>13.6 points</b> and <b>7.8 boards</b> per game in the playoffs. As you can see, that's WAAAY down from his normal production; especially since he looked like the best player in the league early this season. Now I understand that <b>Dirk Nowitzki</b> is an all-world player; everyone's going to have problems guarding Dirk. But I, at least, wanted to see Pau make it tough for his fellow Euro and Dirk was still being Dirk against them.</p>
<p>If Pau can play a game where he contributes his average from the regular season (<b>19</b> and <b>10</b>), then people will get off his back. As is, his highest scoring output so far is <b>17 points</b> (<b>Game 3</b> against <b>New Orleans</b>). Pau needs to attack more and stop taking about 20 seconds trying to make a move on the post. But maybe there's more to this slump, which I'll bring up later on.</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">LAMAR ODOM</font></b></p>
<p>Odom did his part in <b>Game 1</b> but he did pick the wrong time to disappear. It wasn't the best time to go <b>3 for 12</b> in a must-win game. Not to mention he blew a lot of lay-ups. </p>
<p>But he may be the best guy suited to take on Dirk. Odom is agile enough, long enough, and has the footspeed to keep up with Dirk. Odom doesn't have to score a lot since that's not his game but he can play point on the offensive end and help run the offense so he doesn't get gassed by the fourth quarter. </p>
<p><b><font color="purple">THE BENCH</font></b></p>
<p>Outside of Odom, there hasn't been much help. <b>Matt Barnes</b>'s play has been non-existent. <b>Steve Blake</b> has been missing shots and did not look very confident out there in <b>Game 2</b>. <b>Shannon Brown</b> continues to overdribble. With <b>Ron Artest</b> getting suspended for <b>Game 3</b>, the bench gets even thinner. I would assume Barnes is starting so that means <b>Luke Walton</b> (not a fan favorite these days) has to step up. </p>
<p>It could be a blessing in disguise...</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">BYNUM AND BRYANT?</font></b></p>
<p>Maybe <b>Andrew Bynum</b> should've kept his mouth shut. Saying that the team has <i>trust issues</i> after being together for more than three seasons is something else. It's especially not good if it was said to the media first. Those things tend to explode and it becomes a bigger issue than it should, which turns into a distraction. Kobe didn't seem to mind it but what about the others? Bottom line is that it gets people talking.</p>
<p>Still, Bynum has been one of the positives in this series. It'd be nice if he got more touches (other than offensive rebounds) than the three mentioned above in the second half of Game 2. He's also the guy that can get <b>Tyson Chandler</b> in foul trouble. So why not give it to him more?</p>
<p>Kobe's played pretty decently but as the #1 guy, surely he can do more. I suggest for Kobe to get everyone involved first and fire when needed, especially on the closing moments. Also, he can do better than shoot fadeaway jumpers all day. </p>
<p>Basically, the Lakers need to play some smart inside-out ball. Post. Then repost. If doubles come, the shots would be more wide open. Players would have more rhythm for sure but can they convert them?</p>
<p>Still, it's not rocket science. It's basketball. Lakers know that basketball can be an easy game.</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">FATIGUE?</font></b></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the Lakers are going for their <b>fourth straight Finals</b>. The last team that tried that was, well, the <b>2003 Lakers</b>. They stumbled to a fifth seed in the West and finished <B>50-32</b>. And because they never established a good rhythm complete with older players being out of it and fatigued (well, <b>Shaq</b> was his usual out-of-shape self), they were eliminated in <b>Game 6</b> by a <b>San Antonio Spurs</b> team that was on a mission. </p>
<p>Kobe played in the <b>2008 Olympics</b>. Pau seemingly plays every offseason with the <b>Spanish national team</b>. Odom played in the world championships last summer. So their core has played lots and lots and lots of basketball. That could explain why Pau has looked out of sorts. Kobe's playing through a multitude of injuries and maybe that's why he's pacing himself a lot more now. Odom did come through with possibly his most consistent season but if he's dead tired, I wouldn't be surprised.</p>
<p>Maybe they really should lean towards Bynum more. </p>
<p><b><font color="purple">HISTORY IS ON THEIR SIDE</font></b></p>
<p>So the Lakers lost their first two games. Good news? <b>Phil Jackson</b> has come back from 0-2 deficits before (<b>1993</b> with <b>Chicago</b> against <b>New York</b>... and <b>2004</b> against <b>San Antonio</b>). Bad news? Both of those 0-2 deficits come from road losses. Only three teams have come back from that. Ironically, the last one to achieve that was the Mavericks (against <b>Houston</b> in <b>2005</b>). </p>
<p>And we all know that Dallas gave away a 2-0 lead to the <b>Miami Heat</b> in the <b>2006 Finals</b>. Sure, it's a different Mavs team now but it's still Dirk and Jason Terry at the central core.</p>
<p>I've defended that since last season, Dallas has the parts to win it all. They're deep in every position and while history tells us that you need two stars to win a title, there are always exceptions to the supposed rules. I maintain that it's all about getting over the mental hurdle for these guys. After that '06 Finals loss, they suffered playoff losses that would've tore apart a franchise. <b>2007 1st Round loss as a #1 seed</b>. <B>2008 1st Round loss to the younger New Orleans Hornets</b>. <b>2009 2nd Round shellacking by a rejuvenated Denver Nuggets team</b>. <b>2010 1st Round loss as a #2 seed</b>. Yeah, history is not kind.</p>
<p>I'm not saying Lakers will come back and win it... but there is history. They help predict but they don't tell the future. Laker fans have a right to panic but they shouldn't give up hope, either.</p>
<p><b><font color="purple">SO WHAT NOW?</font></b></p>
<p>It's a must-win for both teams. For Dallas, it's good for their psyche to be up <b>3-0</b> against the defending champs after all they've gone through. For the Lakers, winning Game 3 will turn this into a series again. And they should (and will) take it one game at a time. One playoff game can change the course of the series.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/2011Playoffs/LakerPanic003.jpg"></p>
<p>I DOUBT the Lakers can play any worse than they did in Game 2. A lot of players were playing bad (especially on the offensive end) and it was the perfect storm for Dallas to take the win. But the Lakers do have to play their A-game because the Mavs aren't messing around; <b>Dallas is a friggin' good team</b>. If the Lakers take Game 3, they can plant that seed of doubt into Dallas. </p>
<p>But Dallas did come back from an emotional game against <b>Portland</b> when <b>Brandon Roy</b> had that very inspirational <b>Game 4</b> against them. So they have been very resilient thus far. </p>
<p>Can the Lakers win the series? I'll just say <b>it's not impossible</b>.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: <b>this is the biggest game of the Lakers' (and Mavs') season.</b> </p>

<p>Once again, I saved the best for last! (Kidding. Sorta.) But the <strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong> are in the second round after having SOME trouble with the <strong>New Orleans Hornets</strong>. They took care of 'em in six games. Now they face the <strong>Dallas Mavericks</strong> in the second round.</p>
<p>I bring back the usual suspects. Instead of <strong>Andy</strong>, <strong>Brian Kamenetzky</strong> of the <a href="http://landolakers.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/landolakers.com']);"><strong>Land O' Lakers</strong></a> blog from <a href="http://espnlosangeles.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/espnlosangeles.com']);"><strong>ESPN L.A.</strong></a> answers questions. <strong>Jason Riley</strong> and <strong>Chris Manning</strong> from <a href="http://lakernation.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/lakernation.com']);"><strong>LakerNation.Com</strong></a> (newly renamed) also return to answer questions. Once again, follow ALL of them on <strong>Twitter</strong> for your Laker fix: Brian shares his account with his brother at <a href="http://twitter.com/ESPNLandOLakers" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/twitter.com/ESPNLandOLakers']);"><strong>@ESPNLandOLakers</strong></a>, Jason's account is at <a href="http://twitter.com/Jason_Riley" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/twitter.com/Jason_Riley']);"><strong>@Jason_Riley</strong></a>, and Chris is at <a href="http://twitter.com/LD2k" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/twitter.com/LD2k']);"><strong>@LD2k</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Their answers are, of course, in purple. Twelve more games until the threepeat!</p>
<p><strong>This took a while for the Lakers to take care of the Hornets. Is that more on the Lakers or the superb play of Chris Paul?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">BRIAN: A little from column A, a little from column B. The Lakers clearly didn't have quite enough respect for the Hornets when the series opened up, but they got the hang of it pretty fast. CP3, though, was at points too good to contain. There are some players around the league capable of owning games, even when his teammates aren't quite as good. That was Pau in Games 1 and 4. That said, particularly in Game 1, the Lakers did make his life a lot easier. Pau Gasol particularly was a train wreck defensively on the screen and roll. As a team, help was slow, rotations slower.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Credit Paul and the Hornets for putting up a better fight than most figured they would, but once the Lakers invested themselves fully, the incredible disparity in talent became clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">JASON: A little bit of both.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Paul masterfully exploited the Lakers decade long inability to defend the pick-and-roll, and despite his irritating fondness for turning a bump into a gunshot wound, was unquestionably the best player in the series.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">However, the Lakers never lost control of the series:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Game 1 – Lakers are comfortable.</span><br />
<span style="color: purple;">Game 2/3 – Lakers get serious.</span><br />
<span style="color: purple;">Game 4 – Lakers get comfortable.</span><br />
<span style="color: purple;">Game 5/6 – Lakers get serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">At the end of the day, it’s almost always the Lakers vs. the Lakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">CHRIS: A mixture of both. I think the Hornets front line gave the Lakers some problems - most notably Gasol. Thinking back to what Landry did to Gasol back in that Houston series in '09, it was clear Gasol struggled against an undersized PF. Chris Paul was absolutely brilliant. There is not a better PG in the league that can isolate himself, embarrass you, make your ankles a bit sore, and break you down he he pleases. I love Rose, but CP3, at his best, is unlike anyone else in the league. On top of that, the entire Hornets squad played with heart reflective of Paul's determination and will. New Orleans played tough, props to them.</span></p>
<p><strong>Kobe Bryant's ankle is always going to be a concern but he should just be fine, right?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">BRIAN: Well...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">It really depends on what you mean by "fine." He'll play, no question, but the ankle and foot are going to be a looming threat not just in this series, but however long the Lakers go in the postseason. He was still limping around at practice Saturday, and via ESPNLA.com's Dave McMenamin, this is what Phil Jackson said about him Saturday afternoon. "It still affects him a lot," he said. "This is not going to go away anytime soon. We're just going to have to be very close to what he's doing, monitor it a lot. I think that he'll have limited amount of practice time, so it's going to be something that he's going to have to do in games that puts him on beam and the right position to help us out."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">The lack of practice for Bryant won't throw the team- they're used to it- but the Lakers are going to have to be ready to see a different version of Kobe every game, depending on his heath. With games every other day, there just won't be enough time for him to heal up properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">JASON: That depends on your definition of <em>fine</em>. I think there are a couple of options here:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">If <em>fine</em> just means that Kobe will play through it…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Absolutely, Kobe will be just fine. Do you remember the Saw movie where Jigsaw put some sort of bear trap helmet on one of his victims’ heads?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">I truthfully believe that Kobe would play with one of those on his head... and drop 35… and dunk on Okafor…and do a postgame interview with Cheryl Miller.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">If <em>fine</em> means that Kobe will be at 100%...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Well, that remains to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">CHRIS: Kobe Bryant isn't human. As someone once said "Is Kobe a cyborg? Or some type of inter-dimensional or extra terrestrial entity?" On a serious note, the guy changed the entire playoffs for the Lakers when he facialized Okafor in game 5 last series. The guy is unreal. He'll be fine.</span></p>
<p><strong>Well, I brought up Bynum before the first round started. How impressed are you with him?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/2011Playoffs/LAL005.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">BRIAN: Very. Bynum has been a passenger- a very tall passenger- through L.A.'s title runs. Yes, he was on the floor in both years, but didn't really have a significant impact. Mostly, he was out there to be big. This year, as it was down the stretch he's central to the team's success. In the first round, the Lakers were significantly better defensively with Bynum on the floor. He's embracing his role as a defender and rebounder, and at the same time has added a little more aggressiveness to his offensive game.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">He was, for example, much more confident using his face up jumper in the first round than I've ever seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">JASON: In a word: thoroughly. His numbers have been solid (15/10/2), but it’s his efficiency that has impressed me the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">7, 11, 13, 8, 11, 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Those are Drew’s FGA’s in the first round, meaning that he’s doing an outstanding job at taking advantage of his opportunities (55% FG’s) and finding a rhythm without the ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">On the defensive end, he’s rotating faster (11 blocks) and forcing opponents to take tougher shots, rather than letting them get to the rim for layups and dunks. He had an awful lot to do with Chris Paul’s 4/9, 5 turnover performance in Game 6.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">The question with Drew, as it has always been, is…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">You know what; I’m not going to jinx it. Let’s just leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">CHRIS: First time in his career he's averaged 15/10 in a playoff series. He was also extremely efficient with his outside jumpers (shot 55% I believe). Drew is the key. And like New Orleans, Mavs don't really have an answer for him. I'm very excited to see him in this upcoming series!</span></p>
<p><strong>Lakers get the Mavericks. Give me keys for the Lakers to win.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">BRIAN: Here are a couple:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Pau Gasol makes Dirk Nowitzki work defensively. It'll be hard for Gasol (in combination with Lamar Odom, and probably Ron Artest from time to time) to shut Dirk down- nobody really can- but given the very high level Nowitzki wil need to maintain for the Mavs to have a chance, it's hard to believe he could do it carrying a load on both ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">Play the zone properly. If the Lakers get sucked into jumpshooting when the Mavs use their zone, they'll find more trouble. L.A. isn't a great shooting team, but as a group are far to willing to shoot them anyway. Move the ball, move themselves, and they'll create easy buckets in the post.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/2011Playoffs/LAL006.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">JASON: I think the obvious keys in this series are surrounding the Lakers focus, the strength of Kobe’s ankle and figuring out the mismatch Dirk presents the Lakers with. In addition to those…</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Controlling the Pace.</strong> The Mavs are at their best when they’re able to outlet into transition, where Kidd/Terry/Barea become playmakers – either by passing the ball (Kidd is one of the all-time greats at this) or by finding open shooters (Kidd/Terry/Dirk/Peja combined to shoot over 40% from 3 in Round 1). The Lakers can’t afford to get involved in that type of game.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Bynum/Gasol vs. Chandler/Haywood.</strong> These are the guys who will ultimately control the game. The Lakers need Gasol to be the All-Star he was this season (not the guy we saw in Round 1) and Bynum to continue doing what he did to the Mavs this year (16/11 in 3 meetings).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">CHRIS: Contain the outside shooting. I really think if they can run out on the three point shooters they will have a great chance at winning this series. Dirk is Dirk and will get his, but make sure you make it tough for the other guys. The Lakers have a clear strength in their bigs inside. Make sure to keep pounding the ball inside like they did in the later stages of the New Orleans series. Mavs are also very deep. Lakers bench needs to come ready to play and match the Mavs' bench play.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">On the defensive end, the Lakers are clamping down. During the Lakers' regular season, their season average was 95 ppg surrendered. During the Hornets series they held the Hornets to 76 ppg in the last 5 games. There is no question the Lakers solid defense will make the difference in this series. I'm excited to watch it!</span></p>
<p><strong>Series prediction?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">BRIAN: Lakers in six. In the end, they're too good for the Mavs, and talent wins out over a seven-game series in the NBA.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">JASON: Lakers in 6. I like the Mavs to win a game in L.A., and the Lakers to return the favor a couple times in Dallas.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">The Lakers will roll on to play… Memphis (?)… in the Western Conference Finals.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">CHRIS: Lakers in 6. I believe this will be a stressful and exciting series. These two teams dislike each other and the more Jason Terry talks trash in the media, the more it excites me as a fan! That being said, this will be a chippy series. Going to be a fun one.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anything else you wanna say?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">BRIAN: Just that you're a swell guy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">JASON: I love this quote from Tyson Chandler this morning (via ESPN):</span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;"><em>"When you're in the backyard and you're putting up shots and you're doing the countdown, some players would imagine themselves being other players. I would imagine I was killing the Lakers, so hopefully my dreams come true. I guess that I didn't think I could be one, so the next-best thing was beating them."</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: purple;">This is going to be a great series…</span></p>

<p><span style="color: purple;">CHRIS: How exciting will this series be? Remember the 27 point comeback in 2002? Kobe's 62 to Dallas' 61 at the end of 3 quarters in 2006? Terry/Blake altercation from a little over a month ago? This will be a damn fun series. Go Lakeshow!!!!</span></p>

<p>I saved the best for last! Kidding... but they can certainly claim to be the best in the league even as a <b>second seed</b> in the <b>West</b>. It's old-fashioned... but until they're gone, they are the defending champions and they have to be beaten four out of seven times.

<p>The road to the threepeat starts here...</p>
<p><b>The Lakers are the second seed. They draw the Hornets. This was looked at as the "easier" of the opponents. Had the Lakers fallen to the third seed, they would've gone against Portland. But don't you think Portland would've been better just to wake the Lakers up? Or am I dumb for saying this?</b></p>
<p><font color="purple">ANDY: I would never call you "dumb," Rey. At least not with you in the same room. Haha. All joking aside, it's not a dumb theory, but I would like to think you're over-thinking the situation. Yes, the Lakers have spent a lot of time on autopilot, and a sudden loss of focus in April with the second seed still in the balance and the playoffs approaching was disappointing. Still, this team is decidedly built for the postseason and with the Three-peat quest officially underway, motivation shouldn't be a problem anymore. Save the 2009 semi-finals against Houston, the Lakers have been dialed in throughout the playoffs and I don't expect that to change. </font></p>
<p><font color="purple">Plus, to be blunt, if a better opponent is required for the Lakers to take the freakin' <i>playoffs</i> seriously, especially the after backing into the festivities, I'm guessing it wouldn't matter if it was New Orleans, Portland or the '96 Bulls waiting in the first round. That simply reflects a lack of commitment to the process for whatever reason, and I don't know if it can be overcome.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">JASON: That depends on how quickly this veteran – ehh, aged – Lakers team can find a way to flip that enigmatic switch we refer to so often. Last year, Oak City had them on the ropes in the first round and sent a Khloe Kardashian-sized panic through Laker Nation.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">With the superstar leap that LaMarcus Aldridge took this season coupled with the Lakers inability to get up for any game that’s not Game 7 vs. Boston, Portland may have breathed some life into the Lakers… or just taken it all together.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">I’ll take New Orleans without David West for a thousand, please.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">CHRIS: The Rose Garden still scares me. Portland is tough, especially with the addition of Wallace; who was one of the more underrated pickups at the trade deadline. To be honest, I believe the Lakers have enough experience, like Boston, to go into any situation, any arena, and face any opponent in the post-season. As a fan however, I would also be lying if I said I wanted Portland in the first round. The Hornets should be a much better matchup in the Lakers favor than Portland. And Portland is crazy enough to truly believe they can beat Los Angeles in the first round. You're not dumb for saying this, but I'll buy you a beer for the Hornets.</font></p>
<p><b>What's the biggest issue for the Lakers? Health? Effort? Terrible defense?</b></p>
<p><font color="purple">ANDY: During the five game skid, and even the final two wins of the season, the offensive execution was often horrible. Turnovers. Bad ball/people movement. Over-dribbling. No chemistry. Impatience. Too much patience, in that 7-10 seconds would be lolly-gagged away before any semblance of a set was begun. And so on and so forth. Bad offense equals wasted possessions. It also often begets bad defense, since poor shot selection (another byproduct) leads to misses which often leads to transition situations where the Lakers are at their relative worst, defensively.</font> </p>
<p><font color="purple">Plus, at the end of the day, you generally gotta score the ball to win a game, you know?</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">Clean up the offensive execution, return to the team's inside-out identity and I think a lot of good things will in turn fall into place. </font></p>
<p><font color="purple">JASON: Arrogance. In Lamar’s indisputably awkward interview with Cheryl Miller last week</font> (<i>ED's NOTE: "OH, GOD."</i>)<font color="purple"> , he referenced the Lakers frustration with… umm… having to really try hard to win.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">That ridiculous assertion has to disappear the second they take the floor on Sunday vs. New Orleans. It has been a historic year in regards to parity and talent in the NBA, and the Lakers are looking down the barrel of shotgun loaded with 7 bullets pointed in their direction (Spurs, Mavs, Thunder, Heat, Bulls, Celtics).</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">The difference between this year and the past couple of years for the Lakers can be summed up in two statements:</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">(Past 2 years) A healthy and focused Lakers team is the best in the NBA.</font><br />
<font color="purple">(This Year) A healthy and focused Lakers team is one of the best in the NBA.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">With the emergence of Chicago and Miami (who the Lakers are a combined 1-4 against), the line is now blurred, and it will take a lot more heart, and a lot less arrogance, to get a date with Figueroa in June.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">CHRIS: The main issue right now is turning the ball over. Even in their late season losing streak, Phil has always brought this up as a glaring problem. I think when the Lakers play under control, they are very tough to beat considering they can grab rebounds and attack any kind of team with any type of style. When they don't give themselves a chance via turnovers, they make it harder for themselves. I also believe there is a metaphorical "switch" and it's about to be pulled. Annoying for fans, but we know this team knows when to turn it on</font></p>
<p><b>Everyone seems to be back now but am I wrong for saying that the road to 3Peat REALLY depends on the health of Andrew Bynum, who was showing (yet again) flashes of dominance?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/2011Playoffs/LAL002.jpg"></p>
<p><font color="purple">ANDY: I don't know if the Three-peat truly lives or dies by Drew. The last two seasons have proven by definition the Lakers can win a title without Bynum at 100 percent. The mission just becomes that much more difficult, between what could be a more difficult road through the west and the bench's inconsistency, which places more pressure on the starters and Lamar Odom to carry the day. If Bynum can't carry his weight among the starters, that's even more work for Kobe, Fisher, Artest, Pau and LO.</font> </p>
<p><font color="purple">However, with Bynum at full strength -- plus everyone, you know, trying -- the Lakers are borderline unbeatable.</font> </p>
<p><font color="purple">That discrepancy is really illustrates the importance of Andrew. Winning isn't impossible without his dominance, but it's sure a helluva lot easier.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">JASON: Yes and no.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">L.A. needs Bynum if they are going to beat Boston (even without Perkins, the C’s will be tough in the paint), Miami (Bynum is a gigantic mismatch for Bosh and the rest of the Heat front-line) and Oklahoma City (Perkins feeds on Lakers big men).</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">If the Lakers are able to somehow get San Antonio in the Conference Finals and Chicago in the Finals (all speculative, of course), Drew is less of a factor against those teams.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">To state the extremely obvious, the Lakers are absolutely a better and more complete team with a healthy Andrew Bynum. He allows Pau to play his natural position and makes up for the approximately 83 times per game that an opposing guard will sprint right by D-Fish and into the paint. The bigger question here is… will Andrew Bynum be healthy?</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">I wouldn’t bet on it.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">CHRIS: I've been saying this all year as well. They need Andrew to focus on the defensive end to be able to get out of the tougher West. That being said, Andrew's been on one leg (per se) the last two seasons and the Lakers have hoisted the gold. It will be interesting to see how a healthy Bynum (sort of) can contribute to this year's playoff run. Healthy Andrew gives Lakers a defensive anchor.</font></p>
<p><b>So... the Hornets. Keys to beating them?</b></p>
<p><font color="purple">ANDY: Preventing Chris Paul from going goony bird. Plain and simple. The Lakers' front line is considerably better than the Hornets'. Beyond Trevor Ariza, whose offense often negates his defense and has been terrible against the Lakers the last two seasons, they have nobody capable of checking Kobe. I love Carl Landry, but David West's absence is a killer. With Blake out and Barnes perhaps gimpy, New Orleans' bench might be able to provide some fits against the Lakers' second unit. But ultimately, the Hornets live and die by CP3. If he's kept in check, particularly as a playmaker, the Hornets are cooked.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/2011Playoffs/LAL003.jpg"></p>
<p><font color="purple">JASON: There’s only one glaring key that I see in this series for the Lakers: <b>Showing up and playing hard</b>.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">New Orleans is severely undermanned, especially with David West sidelined. A semi-focused Lakers team should dominate this series. Even with the brilliance of Chris Paul, who will have the luxury of running circles around Laker guards (Fish, Brown, Blake), they really don’t have any business hanging around in this series.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">At first glance, you would think that showing up and playing hard goes without saying. Unfortunately, we are talking about the ’10-11 Lakers…</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">CHRIS: Utilizing their size between Bynum/Gasol/Odom. I think those three are the key. That 24 dude isn't bad either. It will be interesting to watch the Artest/Ariza matchup considering the history of the two. Based on Trevor's struggling year, I think Artest can hold him under 40% for the series. That will be a key as with every series in the form of Ron's defense. CP3 will more than likely abuse our backcourt, but I don't think CP3 can defeat the Lakers alone. And more than anything else, it's about effort and controlling the ball; preventing turnovers.</font></p>
<p><b>Seems like every Laker fan is calling for the broom. Agree?</b></p>
<p><font color="purple">ANDY: A sweep is possible, but I think Paul is incredible enough to get his team a game in the Big Easy. Plus, to be fair, the Hornets aren't a bad team. I just don't think they're in the Lakers' class. Four regular seasons wins in as many games didn't happen by accident. Still, my official prediction is "Lakers in 5," but if I had to guess between "Lakers in 4" or "Lakers in 6," I'll take the option a. </font></p>
<p><font color="purple">JASON: Lakers in 5.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">I expect the Lakers to take care of business in Games 1 and 2, only to completely no-show Game 3 all together. After a couple days of media questioning, the Lakers respond by taking Game 4 in New Orleans and wrapping up the series back at Staples Center in Game 5.</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">(I admit, that was way too detailed for a prediction, and is likely to be only about 40% accurate.)</font></p>
<p><font color="purple">CHRIS: I think the Hornets have a shot to steal one. If that happens, it will be Game 3. But I think the Lakers are ready to go. This is what they've been waiting for. Other than that slight concern, who's got a broom for me?</font></p>
<p><b>Anything else you wanna say?</b></p>
<p>(Andy left me hanging!)</p>

<p>I feel like I have to put a disclaimer but... <b>this is NOT an April Fool joke</b>.</p>
<p>After that little scuffle that happened last night at <b>Staples Center</b> between the <b>Mavs</b> and the <b>Lakers</b>, <a href="http://elusionclothing.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/elusionclothing.com']);"><b>Elusion Clothing</b></a> couldn't have picked a better time to come out with a new shirt.</p>
<p>Playing off the <a href="http://www.thenolookpass.com/2010/10/28/fresh-nba-gear-matt-barnes-is-a-scary-man-ii/" ><b>shirt</b></a> from last year, the people from Elusion Clothing came up with this crazy idea. Who DOESN'T love this new badass shirt? Not only would you have to deal with <b>Matt Barnes</b> but you'd have to deal with <b>Ron Artest</b> as well.</p>
<p>You can buy it here <a href="http://elusionclothing.bigcartel.com/product/matt-barnes-ron-artest-kill-you-shirt" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/elusionclothing.bigcartel.com/product/matt-barnes-ron-artest-kill-you-shirt']);"><b>now</b></a> along with <a href="http://elusionclothing.bigcartel.com/product/killah-bees-tee-limited-edition" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/elusionclothing.bigcartel.com/product/killah-bees-tee-limited-edition']);"><b>The Killah Bees T-Shirt</b></a> that I <a href="http://www.thenolookpass.com/2011/03/29/fresh-nba-gear-killah-bees/" ><b>mentioned the other day</b></a> (coincidentally, ALL of them were ejected from the game last night).</p>
<p>When are they going to come out with a <b>Pau Gasol Pokerface shirt</b> seeing as Pau went to the <b>Lady Gaga concert</b> the other day?</p>

<p>While we're still on the subject of <b>Matt Barnes</b> (interview was up <a href="http://www.thenolookpass.com/2011/03/29/tnlp-talks-and-catches-up-with-matt-barnes/" ><b>earlier</b></a>!)...</p>
<p>Earlier in the season, some of the Laker bench players got a nickname. They are called the <b>Killer B's</b> since some of the Laker players' last names start with a B (<b>Steve Blake</b>, <b>Shannon Brown</b>, Barnes). </p>
<p>Now there's a T-Shirt that has them portrayed as bees. I love Steve Blake's expression on the caricature.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's sold just yet but you can check with Mr. Barnes on his Twitter account (since that's where we originally found it).</p>

<p>The <b>Utah Jazz</b> are on a little slump... and in the loaded <b>West</b>, you can't afford to go on little slumps. The Jazz have lost <b>four straight games</b> and some of those games were considered gimmies. But don't tell that to the NBA and its players.</p>
<p>Still, the Jazz sit at <b>27-17</b> and <b>sixth in the West</b>... and the third seed is only two games above them. So they need to stop this losing streak now.</p>
<p>This will be a tough task. They face <b>Deron Williams'</b> favorite team, the <b>Lakers</b>. It's one thing if they're facing them in the confines of the old <b>Delta Center</b> (I refuse to call it <b>Energy Solutions Arena</b>) but they're going to <b>SoCal</b> for this little contest. The Jazz haven't won at <b>Staples</b> in about <b>five years</b>. But the good news is that the last time the Jazz faced the Lakers, they won. So they can be comforted by that fact.</p>
<p>To help me preview this match-up, I got my old buddy, <b>Amar</b>, from <a href="http://www.slcdunk.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/www.slcdunk.com/']);"><b>SLC Dunk</b></a>. He helps me clear up on what I don't know about the Jazz and schools me with some B-Ball knowledge while he was at it. And he's a great follow on <b>Twitter</b> as well, catch him at <a href="http://twitter.com/AllThatAmar" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/twitter.com/AllThatAmar']);"><b>@AllThatAmar</b></a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Q&#038;A. He's in dark blue font under my questions that are on bold font.</p>
<p><b>Once again, it's a crapshoot in the West on the middle Playoff seeds. Utah stands at 27-17 and at #6. Is this where you expected them to be halfway through the season?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">No, I did not expect the Jazz to be where they are now at this point of the year. This season has been difficult for Jazz fans because the eternal optimists that we are prevent us from recognizing that after bringing in six new players, we're closer to a team in transition than a real contender. I had reasonable expectations for this team though; or at least, what I thought were reasonable expectations: win the division and get home court in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since Stockton was wearing those short-shorts. I don't think that is out of the question right now, nor do I think I expected the Jazz to lead the division wire-to-wire from Game 1 through to Game 82. The #6 seed is a bit low for my liking, but the West is always tight. On the other hand, the 27-17 record isn't a bad mark at all, and still projects to be a 50 win team. The previous five years the Jazz average out to have 25 wins after 44 games (and that was with all the consistency and player cohesion that this year's roster lacks). This year the Jazz have two more wins at this point. I should be happy about it; however, recently poor play has made the Jazz fan base quite dour. I'm both surprised and disappointed by where the Jazz are halfway through the season.</font></p>
<p><b>Utah is on a four-game losing streak... and three of those are from sub-.500 teams. What happened there?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">It's never good to lose four games in a row. It's even worse to lose four games during the sequence of one road trip. Further shaming the franchise is to lose each game by a significant margin of defeat. But the absolute worst is to get housed by the Wizards, Nets, and Sixers. The Jazz were absolutely outplayed in each of the games during this trip. The main problems stem from defensive breakdowns. John Wall, Devin Harris, Rajon Rondo, Andre Iguodala, and Louis Williams all faced less resistance to their attempts at penetration than _________ (insert your own lewd punch line here). After that, the rest of the team defense collapsed like a house of cards. While I do not wish to repeat myself here (I broke down this road trip in obsessive detail recently at SLCDUNK.COM), it behooves me to say that you will lose every game you play, when you let the other team shoot about 50 fg% and 44 3pt%, no matter who you are playing against. That said, if you told me that the Jazz would go 4-4 after their first two East road trips (against the likes of Boston, Miami, Orlando, Atlanta, Charlotte, Philly, New Jersey and Washington), trips filled with back-to-back games and third games in four nights, I would have gladly taken it. Perhaps how down you want to get on your team really depends on if you want to focus on the small stuff, or the big picture?</font></p>
<p><b>Deron Williams isn't particularly shooting well this month. Not much to be worried about, right?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">All is not right in Jazzland when Williams isn't performing. When Deron is playing well and/or the team is winning, he's easy to root for. When he feels slighted, and is on the warpath, he's hard to stop. When the team isn't doing so well, and he reverts into this 'pouty Deron' it's very easy to get worried as a Jazz fan. This may not be fully focused on just his shooting woes this month; but we're significantly worried about his overall play and demeanor right now. He's not pushing the ball up the floor, and appears to be taking fewer shots that are either a) the set play, or b) transition opportunities. With 5 seconds on the clock, and the ball in your hand, if you go one-on-one to whittle the clock down and create your own step back jumper off of the wrong foot from 20 feet out you are not using your teammates to their full potential. Oh, yes, we are worried.</font></p>
<p><b>Is Paul Millsap's play something you expected? Career-high 17.1 points per contest this year.</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">I think most Jazz fans and overall hardcore NBA fans knew that Paul Millsap was capable of being more than just Carlos Boozer's understudy. Previous to this season Millsap's numbers in starts (over 50 games, again, due mostly to Boozer injuries) were 16 / 10 / 2 / 1 / 1 in 35 mpg. Seeing him average 17 / 8 / 2 / 1 /1 in less time as a full time starter this season was not surprising at all. His play is more than just the numbers he puts up though. He was an excellent garbage man who hustled, put his body on the line, and filled that niche quite well. Promoting him to the 'Boozer' role made a huge hole in the depth chart for that hustle guy. Sloan even said as much earlier this season. I think the Jazz fans (and maybe the Jazz brass as well) expected Millsap to maintain his bottled up tenacity over the course of longer periods on the floor. Of late, his effort on defense seems to have waned and his boardmanship is less than adequate from what we've seen him do. I suppose there is a floor spacing issue with Al Jefferson on the team now that previously did not exist when Millsap was on the floor with the more face-up oriented Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur in previous seasons. Millsap has become much more adept at facing up himself this year, but there are some concerns with his recent production - season averages of 17 ppg notwithstanding.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/Pix/laluta010.jpg">
<p><b>Al Jefferson is putting up some decent numbers as well. How has he been for your team?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Jazz fans fell in love with Al Jefferson early on this off-season with his 'aw shucks' diction and overall personable self. (He made a lot of fans when he said he hates the Lakers, by the way.) Alas, there's more to the game than being a fan favorite. The sets that are run in Utah are nothing like the stuff he was used to in Minnesota. A great deal of work is done trying to un-teach all of his poor habits. He's not an efficient scorer (Points per shot), and this significantly distinguishes himself from the likes of Boozer, Millsap, Malone, and Dantley -- all high-ish scoring members of the modified Dick Motta forward oriented offense that Sloan runs. He's also not used to passing the ball - but he is willing to do so, even if he's not yet aware of when he's supposed to do it. It is an up-hill battle for Jefferson to be molded into what his team mates (and coaches) need him to be in this offense. As a result, the Jazz haven't looked that great this season in the one area where the Jazz were quite capable: offensive execution. He has been surprisingly better on defense, though, and leads the team in blocks per game (2) - which is something you'd never see written about Carlos Boozer. As the season progresses we hope that he can recognize what's happening on the court a little faster than he does now. He will be much better next year with another training camp under his belt. As of right now, the coaches have taught him a little more than the bare minimum of the plays and variations. I think he's more of a throwback style post player - something the Jazz have missed for a long time; though his shot selection can be frustrating at times. He needs to dunk it more frequently, cute little jump hooks can rim out. Dunks rarely do.</font></p>
<p><b>How far is Memo Okur from being 100 percent?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">I don't have any inside information on this, but from what I can deduce from observation alone -- Okur is physically  +70% back. The only things lacking are conditioning and muscle memory (for his legs / footwork on defense and box outs). His operation and apparently successful recovery would have made him a medical marvel if this happened 10-15 years ago. Today, we should expect him to make a near complete recovery in 18 to 26 months. Memo is back only a handful of months from his injury - so that's pretty hardcore. But he's not going to be physically over 80% for another year though. (That's why people say it's a 2-year injury) That said, an Okur at 73% is going to be much more than the Jazz have had in the playoffs the last few seasons; and should help the team out significantly. Or he would, pending the presumed recovery on the basketball side of things as well. Right now, his ability is that of a guy who is in the off-season before they start training hard before pre-season camps start. It's January and his basketball clock is currently in August. That's the bigger problem I see. He's not very useful right now but hopefully by being in the Rasheed Wallace basketball time zone, he'll be fresher and in his peak during the final push for playoff seeding. Time can only tell.</font></p>
<p><b>And do you like the move of C.J. Miles to the bench?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">I think it was necessary to move him to the bench with how weak the bench got with the massive wing migration this off-season (Wesley Matthews, Kyle Korver, etc). For the Jazz the 6th Man is usually more capable on offense than the 4th or 5th starter. Heck, even when the Jazz got to the NBA Finals the first time, Sloan had Adam Keefe and Greg Ostertag as starters. Plugging in Raja Bell to be a catch and shoot guy works better when he's on the floor with better team mates as well. Miles, off the bench, gets more touches and is expected to do more with the ball as well. It has worked out for him as he gets to be 'the man' against second units. If he gets hot, he'll stay in the game. If not, Sloan will finish with the starters. It's not a bad plan in that regard. And for a streaky guy like C.J., it's easier to get hot when you're scoring on Dante Cunningham, instead of Nic Batum. That said, Miles may be put into the starting line-up as the Jazz coaches look for answers to stop the bleeding. Utah has developed the bad habit of being down, and down big, after the first quarter in the vast majority of the 44 games played this season. I expect a number of changes to occur.</font></p>
<p><b>Your boys beat the Lakers in an outstanding comeback on Black Friday. The Jazz also haven't won at Staples Center in about five years. So give me some keys for the Jazz to beat the Lakers.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/Pix/laluta011.jpg">
<p><font color="navy">The win against the Lakers seems like ages ago now, and was attributed to SLCDUNK / S*B Network member Gleb Dok who had that sign in the VIP section behind the Lakers bench about Kobe's ego. I don't think he's going to be at Staples so I fully expect another loss. Superstition aside, the Lakers have a psychological edge over the Jazz and are just bigger. I don't mean bigger inside (that's obvious), but I also mean longer. The Lakers' length hurts the Jazz more horizontally than vertically as the precise passing that the Jazz offense requires then becomes predicated upon making increasingly difficult passes through small openings in LA's defense. It's easier to make sharp crisp passes against Jason Kidd, Jason Terry and Shawn Marion than it is to make those same passes past the long arms of Kobe, Ron, and Lamar. The Jazz aren't going to beat the Lakers with a series of predictable half court sets. For the Jazz to 'beat' the Lakers, they will have to do two things on offense: run more isos / two man games; and get easy baskets. The Jazz are having trouble with passing the ball right now against bad defensive teams. Fewer passes in the half court mean less chances at giving the other team a fastbreak. Deron needs to iso more, get more screens, and have players move to an overflow position on one side of the court. He has to do his work against Fisher/Blake and create the offense -- the playbook should be an after thought. (After all, your guys know it better than half of this new Jazz team know it right now) Easy buckets are found through good, solid defense and defensive rebounding. Sloan may be forced to play a little 'bigger' than he's used to right now. I'm not fond of the Jazz small ball experiment. Bigger guys should mean being able to hold our ground on the defensive glass. Which means more potential transition baskets / baskets that are products of non-halfcourt play.</font></p>
<p><font color="navy">Lastly, gotta hope that the Lakers forget that Gasol eats the Jazz up inside, and settle for outside jumpers.</font></p>
<p><b>Care to give a prediction for this game?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Lakers fans in attendance get Tacos, while Jazz fly back to SLC to face the Spurs on a horrible back to back. Ronnie Price and/or Earl Watson will have the highlight of the night for Jazz fans with a late 4th quarter technical foul.</font></p>
<p><font color="navy">Thanks again, and best of luck for the rest of the season!</font></p>
<p><b>What a nice guy!</b></p>

<p>So one of the surprises this season... actually, NO, it shouldn't be a surprise. The more we count this team out, the stronger they come back. The <b>San Antonio Spurs</b> are <b>26-4</b> and have the <b>best record in the league</b>. And if you're superstitious like that, it is also an odd-numbered year so, chances are, they're going to win the title this season! </p>
<p>The Spurs have the <b>Lakers</B> next. The Lakers are at <b>21-9</b> and are struggling a little bit. They were smashed by the <b>Miami Heat</b> on <b>Christmas Day</b>... and, before that, they were beaten by the <b>Milwaukee Bucks</b> at home.</p>
<p>Both of these teams are sure to use this as a barometer of where they are as a team. To help preview this baby, I decided to get an old friend of mine, <b>Jeff Garcia</b>, from <a href="http://projectspurs.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/projectspurs.com']);"><b>Project Spurs</b></a>. Follow Jeff on <b>Twitter</b>: <a href="http://twitter.com/sa2ny2004" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/twitter.com/sa2ny2004']);"><b>@sa2ny2004</b></a>. And, of course, check out their fantastic podcast, the <a href="http://www.projectspurs.com/table/podcasts/episodes/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/outbound-article/www.projectspurs.com/table/podcasts/episodes/']);"><b>SpursCast</b></a>.</p>
<p>My questions are in <b>bold</b> while Jeff's answers are in dark blue. Let's renew this rivalry like <b>ESPN</b> would!</p>
<p><b>Last summer, you said you didn't consider the Spurs as a contender to the title. You even mentioned that they were pretty much starting with their rebuilding. What do you think now?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Well if you look at it, they have rebuilt very quietly. Added Tiago Splitter, Gary Neal, James Anderson, DeJuan Blair, and Richard Jefferson to the Big 3 of Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. But more importantly, the Big 3 got rest, finally. Now we are seeing the Spurs play at a high level but my concern is if they peaked too soon. If you look at their last few games before the Magic beat down, they were barely pulling out wins.</font></p>
<p><b>Richard Jefferson's performance has been quite the opposite this year from last year. He's shooting much, much better as well. Is it really just a matter of getting more comfortable in his role?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Actually, it took coach Popovich to give him an ultimatum. Over the summer, Pop basically said to RJ he can either relax, enjoy his summer but be shipped to another team or work with Pop to learn the Spurs system.  As you can see, it's been paying off. Seems RJ made the right decision.</font></p>
<p><b>Tim Duncan isn't playing as many minutes but he is still producing when he's on the floor. Will this be a huge factor come playoff time?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">How is this for the rest of the NBA: Duncan will be well-rested come the stretch run. Scary, huh?</font> </p>
<p><b>And, of course, we can't forget that Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker have been outstanding this season. Must be the rest they got over the summer, huh?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Bingo. No playing for their national teams in Turkey this summer, healing, and resting up is paying dividends.</font>  </p>
<p><b>Besides the main four guys of Parker, Manu, RJ, and Duncan... who else has really impressed you?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Gary Neal. I was fortunate to cover the 2010 NBA Summer League and knew right away he was another under-the-radar find for the Spurs. Sure, he is a rookie but not the traditional rookie. He has played pro ball overseas and is not wet behind the ears. Guy is nails! Not afraid to take the shot and has been a key component in the Spurs hot start.</font></p>
<p><b>The Lakers are 21-9 despite what seems to be an improved team. Are they really just sleepwalking in your opinion?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">OK, first, 21-9 is not bad at all. Sure, they are dropping a few games but come on. A team with Bryant and coached by Phil Jackson won't go away that easily. They will be fine. Issue for LA is sustaining the championship caliber of play. They are still the favorites out of the West and with an imposing front-line of Bynum, Gasol, Odom, and Smith, should be a concern for all challengers including the Spurs.</font></p>
<p><b>What do the Spurs have to do to win?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Guard play. The Lakers have the Spurs in the frontcourt but Manu and Parker will be an issue for the Lakers. Sure you got Blake, Barnes, Fisher, and Brown but aside from Barnes, not really much of perimeter defense. He can't guard both of them. Also, Hill will be an issue for LA, another guard who can cause some damage to LA.</font></p>
<p><font color="navy">Also with no perimeter defender to check Bryant, I suggest let him do his damage and slow everyone else. A tall task but the Spurs can do it.</font> </p>
<p><font color="navy">One other point, the Spurs cannot look ahead and past this game. The next team the Spurs face will be the Mavericks. They must focus on the game at hand.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b131/r2estyle/NLP/lakersspurs.jpg">
<p><b>Prediction of what's going to happen.</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">It will be another classic SA v LA contest but the Spurs win a close one in San Antonio.</font> </p>
<p><b>You miss me, don't you?</b></p>
<p><font color="navy">Of course. I mean, who else can go out with me in Las Vegas, get tanked off one beer, and have a woman toss a drink in his lap like you, Rey!</font></p>
<p><b>I have no idea what you're talking about!</b></p>

<p>We're not really used to seeing this but... the <b>Lakers</b> have lost <b>four straight</b>. All these people are saying, <i>"Well, Phil Jackson title teams have never lost four straight!"</i></p>
<p>These are problems we have seen before so it's not like this is completely baffling to the fan. I feel everything's going to be okay. It's silly to push the panic button but I can understand why Laker fans are annoyed. </p>
<p><b>Kobe Bryant</B> is right. It all comes down to defense. Although I do have a bone to pick with <b>Mister Black Mamba</b> here with his incredible basketball IQ but I digress. The defense has been suspect all year. It's not <b>Houston Rockets</b>-bad (the ones that just beat them earlier tonight); hell, it's not even incredibly bad. They're <b>11th</b> overall in defensive efficency. But they have some lapses that would drive a lot of people mad. </p>
<p>Their closeouts on the perimeter have been horrendous. In that earlier <b>109-99 loss</b> against <b>Houston</b>, they couldn't close out on the shooters. <b>Shane Battier</b> took over the fourth quarter, in part because he had open looks behind the arc. <b>Chase Budinger</b> was getting them and, while he didn't make any threes, <b>Kevin Martin</b> was getting those looks as well. Couple that with some more lazy defense and <b>Pau Gasol</b> being completely out of it (it was so hard to watch Pau play out there; probably the worst game I had ever seen him play), and you got a recipe for a loss. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://thenolookpass.com/Pix/lakers032.jpg">
<p>Perimeter defense has been problematic throughout this losing streak. <b>Mike Conley</b> looked like the best point guard in the NBA when he went against the Lakers. He knifed his way against whoever was (not) guarding him in their bout. <b>Deron Williams</b> certainly made them look silly when <b>Utah</b> beat them and the <b>Pacer</b> guard tandem of <b>Darren Collison</b> and <b>T.J. Ford</b> schooled them on almost every play (especially the last play where Ford got an inexplicable double-team before he passed it to <b>Roy Hibbert</b> for the game-clinching basket). What was frustrating in last year's regular season is frustrating again. <b>Derek Fisher</b> couldn't stay with these guys. <b>Kobe Bryant</b> doesn't seem to give his best effort on D, at times... and <b>Shannon Brown</b> and <B>Steve Blake</b> will never be confused as elite perimeter defenders.</p>
<p>Laker fans are frustrated with the offense and rightfully so. The winning formula earlier in the season was getting <b>Pau Gasol</b> more touches than ever. In the first seven games, it was just that. Then starting against <b>Minnesota</b>, <b>Kobe Bryant</b> decided to start chucking again (<b>16.1 shot attempts</b> in first 7 games, <b>23.9</b> in last 12 games). Kobe does NOT need to shoot that much with this talent around him. What's even more maddening is that, sometimes, he takes really difficult shots (the fadeaways, the contested three-pointers). And I understand it goes both ways (can't stand around when Kobe is shooting)... but more often than not, he feels the need to initiate his own offense first before the team's. If he's all about winning (and he knows he can't do it alone), why is he doing this? Yes, there are some instances where he HAS to take over (against <b>Indiana</b> was a good example). If the rest of the team is not feeling it, then go ahead and take over. However, he should only take over as a last resort, not during the first quarter. <b>Lamar Odom</b> only took two shots in that fourth quarter (one was a desperate three in the waning seconds) against the Rockets but he shouldn't have to defer when he has the ability to take over a game himself. That's why I said it goes both ways; Lakers should find a happy medium with this. </p>
<p>We raved about the newlyfound depth of this team but health is still a worry. <b>Andrew Bynum</b> is still a couple of weeks away from returning and <b>Theo Ratliff</b> will still be out for a month or so. It showed in the last few games that Pau Gasol is just out of gas. And it's not pretty when he is; I mentioned he might have played the worst game of his career against the Rockets (2/8 FGs, <b>8 points</b>). Gasol will probably endure this for a couple more weeks and everything will be okay...</p>
<p>Yes, everything will be okay. First off, it's still only <b>December</b>. Championships are not won in December. And the health of the team will get better. Bynum and Ratliff come back and we'll rave once again about the depth on every position for the Lakers. Is a four-game losing streak something to watch out for? Definitely. But they've been through some hardships before and <b>Phil Jackson</b> didn't win <b>11 titles</b> by accident. Kobe will figure it out because he's smart enough to know that and the Lakers will play better defense (especially with the bigs back) because they know that's the way to a title (no, I didn't forget about <b>Ron Artest</b> and his decreased playing time but I believe that will fix itself down the line as well). It's perfect that the Lakers have the <b>Sacramento Kings</b> and the <b>Washington Wizards</b> next. Those two teams aren't exactly setting the league on fire so the Lakers should be able to run them over. Of course, they should've ran over the <b>T-Wolves</b> and the Rockets...</p>
<p>Let's hope the Lakers stop their slide first before we think too far ahead.</p>
