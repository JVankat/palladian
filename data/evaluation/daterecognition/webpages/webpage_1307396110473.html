      <p>KD: I&#8217;d like to start by asking you about your experience as a
        theatre director in the 1960s, specifically when you were running the
        Vic in 1968. With the Theatres Act coming in and the end of censorship,
      can you recall what happened after the act was passed?</p>
      <p>PC: Well, it was a relief because we didn&#8217;t have the hassle of
        having to get a script across to the Lord Chamberlain before we opened,
        because as virtually more than half our programme was new plays and we
        were working on them actively up to and after the opening, rewriting
        them and so on, it was impossible often - or very, very difficult - to get
        an accurate script that the author was pleased with. That&#8217;s just
        the way creating new plays works and so the script that went to the Lord
        Chamberlain was in some senses unfinished. So it was a great relief when
        we didn&#8217;t have to do that. We were required, as I remember, by the
        Arts Council as a conditional subsidy, it seemed to be a condition under
        which the act was approved that the source of new scripts, the existence
        of new scripts was safe-guarded because you had to send one to the British
        Library at some stage after the opening. I don&#8217;t think&#8230; it
        didn&#8217;t specify any longer before the opening. I mean in the Lord
        Chamberlain days of the&#8230; authority of the Lord Chamberlain&#8217;s
        office you simply had to get the script before you could show the play
        in public and there were some plays that we had a lot of trouble with,
        particularly when Peter Terson came to write for us because the language
        used and the topics covered were much freer and much wider and much more
        vigorous and frank than had existed heretofore, as it were. But I don&#8217;t
        remember anything else other than we were required to do it as a condition
        of subsidy and that when the subsidy responsibility was devolved to the
        Regional Arts Boards the same applied. Now we simply did as we were told
        and the odd thing is that hearing that this deposition by everybody was
        very unusual and that we seemed to have ended up being the only good
        boys or something.</p>
      <p>KD: Yes, pretty much.</p>
      <p>PC: Because we used to get letters from the British Library or sometimes
        telephone calls. I think certainly I noticed that we probably hadn&#8217;t
        deposited the script. Now I can&#8217;t give you chapter and verse, it&#8217;s
        something I never thought about, it&#8217;s a sensible arrangement, very
        sensible and practical arrangement to make sure we got that&#8230; the
        country had copies of original scripts that would otherwise go astray
        or be forgotten because there&#8217;s an enormous amount of work that
        never gets done twice. And it does represent a dramaturgical reservoir
        that somebody should tap. I mean, in organisations like the TMA [Theatrical
        Management Association] or SOLT [Society of London Theatres] that preceded
        TMA - it became part of TMA - but there were various schemes to try and get
        second productions or third productions of plays that had been premiered
        at a member theatre, and the Arts Council sponsored a scheme for the first - second
        - production of such plays, I seem to remember at one stage. So there was
        quite a lot of concern that those types of new plays, which were often
        the result of an Arts Council commission or an Arts Council-assisted
        commission shouldn&#8217;t be lost just on one production that might
        not have been terribly good or might have been a good one but nobody
        noticed it. There are a number of plays that are always from regional
        theatre and a great number of artists who came out of regional theatre,
        actors, designers and directors. But it represents a pretty important
        contribution to the nation&#8217;s stock of drama and this seemed like
        an excellent dodge to ensure that those scripts didn&#8217;t go awry&#8230; go
        astray. How many people use the British Library stock of plays that have
        been produced and sent there I don&#8217;t know. It sounds as if nobody
        else did but us. A handful of people, it doesn&#8217;t seem worthwhile
        going down there.</p>
      <p>KD: Well I think as time went on the script depositions became more
        regular from certain people, but from everyone I&#8217;ve spoken to it
        was certainly a reactive process rather than a proactive process, and
        the people I&#8217;ve spoken to have said that they would wait to get
        a letter and then they would send the script in. </p>
      <p>PC: A letter from British Library?</p>
      <p>KD: Yes.</p>
      <p>PC: How did the British Library know that the play was on?</p>
      <p>KD: Well the reason they know now is because of <em>The Stage</em>. They go through
        the forthcoming attractions in <em>The Stage</em>. I don&#8217;t know how they
        did it right at the beginning. I guess they&#8217;d have used something
        like the <em>Theatre Record</em> or&#8230;</p>
      <p>PC: Yes, well <em>London Theatre Record</em> hasn&#8217;t been going all that
        long time. It certainly didn&#8217;t&#8230; about half through my career
        that started, but not any earlier. I think mid-seventies. </p>
      <p>KD: Oh really? So was there anything before that that would have collected&#8230;?</p>
      <p>PC: I mean, the <em>London Theatre Record</em> has a regional section, and so far
        as I know that was pretty comprehensive but&#8230; there were magazines
        like <em>Plays and Players</em>, <em>Theatre World</em> and&#8230;</p>
      <p>KD: <em>Encore</em>.</p>
      <p>PC: <em>Encore</em> and one or two that came and went with <em>New Theatre Quarterly</em>
        and so on. And <em>London Theatre Record</em> with its regional appendix as it
        were or section was the most comprehensive. I mean, <em>Theatre World</em> would
        noticeably concentrate on West End successes with a sort of extra story,
        with the plot of this latest light comedy in the West End set in Surrey,
        a set with French windows...</p>
      <p>KD: Loamshire.</p>
      <p>PC: Yes. But I don&#8217;t think there was any comprehensive survey
        printed of them, even in <em>The Stage</em>, of regional work. </p>
      <p>KD: Well, I think that&#8217;s the problem. I don&#8217;t think there
        is still. It becomes very hard to find out what&#8217;s new. It did occur
        to me actually when you were speaking earlier, do you think anyone suspected
        that sending your script to the British Library might be a kind of means
        of censorship in a more benign form?</p>
      <p>PC: No. Well, if we did think it, it never happened. It seemed to be
        a completely and utterly sensible and wise device to make sure the scripts
        didn&#8217;t go astray. So I don&#8217;t think any of us&#8230; well suspicious-minded people you know working in the theatre, just a bit self-centred
        or very self-centred.</p>
      <p>KD: I also wondered how you kind of interpreted the act, because the
        act is very loose in terms of what is says is 'A copy of any new
        play performed in a licensed space much be deposited with the British
        Library&#8217;s manuscripts department'. It doesn&#8217;t specify
        whose responsibility that is so it&#8217;s interesting&#8230; did you
        see it as your role as the kind of artistic director?</p>
      <p>PC: Who else&#8217;s?</p>
      <p>KD: The literary manager, the general administrator, the playwright
        himself or herself?</p>
      <p>PC: I mean, I don&#8217;t think the playwright was conscious of it,
        one of two might have been. 95% of regional theatres and all the small
        scale highly creative touring theatres don&#8217;t have literary managers.
        Literary managers are officers of theatres who have bloated subsidy I
        would say - bitterly! </p>
      <p>KD: Maybe. I don&#8217;t think the RSC would say that.</p>
      <p>PC: No, they have their administrators and literary managers and all
        the rest of them and people who bring trays of tea round and all that
        sort of thing. But I mean it was the chief&#8230; well, no we didn&#8217;t
        have chief executives then, thank God, it was the theatre director or
        the artistic director&#8217;s responsibility, unless they told us to
        pass it down to some minion but usually there was no minion to pass it
        down to. You&#8217;re talking about quite economical levels of staffing
        in most of our cases. The step between the national companies and the
        half dozen&#8230; the big ten or whatever they&#8217;re called at any
        period of time who have rather generous staffs, good boys and girls of
        the arts world get all the problems as it were. They have these things
        but an awful lot of the most adventurous theatres didn&#8217;t have them.
        So one would see it as the theatre director or the artistic director&#8217;s
        responsibility or the general manager. It just depends on relationships.
        Sometimes the two posts are equal in status, which I think is dangerous;
        and sometimes the general manager is in charge of the theatre manager,
        which is cock-eyed in my view - but one of those two people. And if you&#8217;re
        really big you might have a literary manager. You just expected him to
        be the chappie who did it.</p>
      <p>KD: Well I was thinking maybe that some theatres operated on the Royal
        Court basis that you gave someone a kind of title of 'Literary Manager'
        and paid them a few pence a week to look over the scripts but while training
        them in-house.</p>
      <p>PC: Yes, but looking at the body of theatre as a whole of producing theatre,
        those people who had that luxury are in a distinct minority, so there&#8217;s
        nobody like that. I mean often theatres&#8230; medium to small scale theatres
        like I ran would have people to help the... with their script reading, perhaps
        an assistant director on bursary from independent television, a trainee
        director or an assistant director on an Arts Council scheme. Or a friend,
        or a schoolmaster - or the theatre director&#8217;s wife in my case! - and
        my senior colleagues, the leading actors. I remember I phoned Peter Terson
        because he sent a script and I had Bernard Gallagher - the actor - a very
        distinguished actor who worked in the company with me in the early days.
        I passed that to Bernard to read, the play that Peter had sent to me
        and he gave it back to me saying, 'This is truly superior' and
        we ended up doing 25 of Peter&#8217;s plays. So we operate on&#8230; it&#8217;s
        quite a load, particularly if you get a reputation for doing new plays.
        You get an awful lot of text, and being a small staff probably directing
        every other show or three out of four or something like that, it&#8217;s
        a lot to do. So you wanted some help but paying was out of the question.
        Sometimes people used to get paid five quid a script or something like
        that to get them read. But so many of the plays that you were sent were
        just drivel and plays set after the nuclear holocaust with characters
        called The Woman, The Soldier, Death and so on. We used to get a lot
        of them. We just read the first page and thought 'Oh God' and
        sent it back.</p>
      <p>KD: And did you write anything on them or you just send them back?</p>
      <p>PC: Well we kept reading reports. My [first] wife used to do that painstakingly.
        But she was so sympathetic that she used to send kind letters. We tried
        to write to everybody so Joyce used to send kind letters to six foot
        actresses and hopelessly misguided playwrights who wrote plays about
        death and the nuclear holocaust and The Woman and The Soldier. The result
        was that they would send five scripts and Joyce made life-long friendships
        with these huge actresses and&#8230; really! Because if you&#8217;re six
        foot four and an actress there&#8217;s not many parts you can play except
        Volumnia and Queen of the Amazon. </p>
