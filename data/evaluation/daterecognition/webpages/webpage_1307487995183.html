  <p class="MsoHeader" style="text-align: left">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial">In the Olivet Discourse, Jesus said, the angels �will 
  gather his elect�. The word �elect� is translated from the Greek word 
  �eklektos.� The Greek word �eklektos� is recorded 24 times in the New 
  Testament manuscripts and it is translated either &quot;the elect&quot; or &quot;the chosen.&quot; 
  So, who are the elect that Jesus is referring to in the Olivet Discourse? </font></p>
  <p class="MsoHeader" style="text-align: left">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial">Some believe &quot;the elect&quot; is Israel others 
  believe &quot;the elect&quot; is all believers. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoHeader" style="text-align: left">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial">Whenever we have a question regarding what God 
  means, we 
  should always ask God for the answer. We do this by searching His Word to see 
  what else He says on the topic. So, let�s examine Scripture to see what God says 
  about His elect.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>For then there will be great distress, unequaled from 
  the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again. If those 
  days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the <u>elect [eklektos</u>] those days will be shortened. At that time if anyone says to you, 
  'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it.&nbsp; For false 
  Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to 
  deceive even the <u>elect [eklektos]</u>- if that were possible. See, I have told you 
  ahead of time. &quot;So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do 
  not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. For as 
  lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the 
  coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will 
  gather. &quot;Immediately after the distress of those days &quot;'the sun will be 
  darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the 
  sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' &quot;At that time the sign of the 
  Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will 
  mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with 
  power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, 
  and they will gather his <u>elect [eklektos]</u> from the four winds, from one end of the 
  heavens to the other </i>(Matthew 24:21-31).</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would 
  survive. But for the sake of the <u>elect, [eklektos]</u> whom he has chosen, he has 
  shortened them.&nbsp; At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the 
  Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.&nbsp; For false Christs and 
  false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the <u>elect [eklektos</u>]--if that were possible� And he will send his angels and gather his
  <u>elect [eklektos</u>] from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of 
  the heavens</i> (Mark 13:20-27).</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>And the Lord said, &quot;Listen to what the unjust judge 
  says. And will not God bring about justice for his <u>chosen [eklektos]</u> ones, who cry 
  out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will 
  see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, 
  will he find faith on the earth?&quot;</i> (Luke 18:6-8)</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered 
  at him. They said, &quot;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ 
  of God, the <u>Chosen [eklektos]</u> One&quot;</i> (Luke 23:35)</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>For those God foreknew he also predestined to be 
  conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among 
  many brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he 
  also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.&nbsp; What, then, shall we 
  say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did 
  not spare his own Son, but gave him up for <u>us all </u>- how will he not 
  also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge 
  against those whom God has <u>chosen [eklektos]</u>? It is God who justifies</i> (Romans 
  8:29-33).</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>Greet Rufus, <u>chosen [eklektos] </u>in the Lord, and his mother, 
  who has been a mother to me, too. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, 
  Hermas and the brothers with them. Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his 
  sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them. Greet one another with a 
  holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings. I urge you, brothers, to 
  watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are 
  contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them</i> (Romans 
  16:13-17).</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>Therefore, as God's <u>chosen [eklektos]</u> people, holy and 
  dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, 
  gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances 
  you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over 
  all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. 
  Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you 
  were called to peace. And be thankful</i> (Colossians 3:12-15).</font></p>

  <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><i>As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men 
  but <u>chosen</u> [eklektos] by God and precious to him-- you also, like living stones, 
  are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering 
  spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in Scripture 
  it says: &quot;See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and 
  the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.&quot; Now to you who believe, 
  this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, &quot;The stone the 
  builders rejected has become the capstone,&quot; and, &quot;A stone that causes men to 
  stumble and a rock that makes them fall.&quot; They stumble because they disobey 
  the message--which is also what they were destined for. But you are a chosen 
  people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you 
  may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his 
  wonderful light.&nbsp; Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of 
  God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy</i> (1 Peter 
  2:4-10)</font></p>

  <font color="#000000" face="Arial">As we can see in God�s Word �<i>eklektos� </i>is used to refer to

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">
