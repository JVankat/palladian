<P>OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH<H2>Cotton Mill Dust May Be Carrier as Well as Culprit 
in Respiratory Ills</H2><P>Other Suspect Is Endotoxin Released by Bacteria in Cotton<P>The cotton textile industry has always followed a steady progression toward cheaper labor and operations--from industrial centers in the U.S. and the U.K. in the early 1900s to small towns in the American South, and then to Egypt, Mexico, and Asian countries. Now in countries like China, mills in the cities are closing and moving to rural towns, mimicking the U.S. experience. As the industry follows this ongoing march, the new sites inherit some of the health impacts that come with working in a cotton mill--symptoms that have been called in turn "mill fever," "Monday fever," "brown lung," and byssinosis.<P>

A recent report on cotton mill workers in China by David Christiani, HSPH professor of occupational medicine and epidemiology and HMS professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, summarizes several of his studies on respiratory illness in exposed workers. The findings suggest that the dust raised in milling may not be the sole cause of chronic ill health, as previously believed. Rather, the cause may also be bacterial endotoxin carried by the dust after it has been released when cells of bacteria that populate the cotton die and disintegrate. Since the bacteria do not live only in cotton, the findings may serve notice to other occupations, as well.<h4>Dusty Processing</h4>After cotton is picked and seeded, it is taken to mills where it is blown open and further cleaned, carded, combed, and spun into threads. The earliest steps of the process release a great deal of dust in the air, and long-term exposure can leave mill workers with respiratory disorders. Typical byssinosis, a syndrome similar to asthma, does not appear until after several years of regular exposure, the symptoms often surfacing at the first shift of the week. <P>

Though the most severe forms of byssinosis are progressive and irreversible, the effects of cotton dust have mainly been studied in terms of acute airway responses that are thought to clear up when workers retire. Christiani has been studying textile workers in China to find out what the long-term effects of exposure to cotton dust are and to try to characterize the early changes in respiratory function that predate disease.<P>He gathered a cohort of about 1,000 textile workers in Shanghai in 1981--half of them cotton workers and half silk workers as controls--of whom 83 percent have continued to participate. His team measures levels of environmental exposure to dust in each mill, assesses basic lung volume and capacity using a spirometer, and challenges subjects with methacholine to detect asthmatic symptoms. In a review in the March <I>Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine,</I> Christiani explains how over the course of the study his group found that the level of respiratory decline in these workers correlated less with the amount of cotton dust in their environment than the level of endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria that grow within the bract and other parts of the cotton plant. Other studies over the past two decades also have implicated endotoxin in occupational disease.<P>

Endotoxin was thought to explain the initial flulike symptoms and chest tightening that many people experience when first exposed to dust, but not the long-term damage. "Our hypothesis was that there were separate syndromes caused by separate constituents of the dust. But we found that the chronic lung function loss and symptoms are better associated with cumulative endotoxin exposure than with cumulative dust," he said.<h4>Early Impairment</h4>Christiani's team has also found evidence that exposure to cotton dust can impair respiratory function in the short term. They conducted a longitudinal study of 225 newly hired textile workers in Shanghai, testing respiratory function at three, 12, and 18 months after their start date. "We're looking at the earliest physiological changes in healthy people," he said.<P>

Hospital (Photo courtesy of David Christiani)</font><hr>


The research, published in the February <I>Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine,</I> found that workers not only experienced acute drops in lung volume and capacity over the course of a shift, but there was some longitudinal decline in lung function after one year. "We were surprised by how soon after entry to the trade that these respiratory responses happened. In three months from baseline, there are people who are having changes in their airway reactivity," Christiani said. <P>A better understanding of these early markers may help in monitoring workers and detecting respiratory problems before symptoms appear. However, it is still unclear whether respiratory function continues to worsen or eventually improves. The studies are subject to a healthy worker effect bias since those with the most respiratory problems find other work.<h4>What About the Toxin?</h4>In the U.S., OSHA standards require that ventilation systems keep cotton dust levels below 0.2 mg/cubic meter. These studies raise the question whether endotoxin levels should also be capped. "Dust control was enough from a public health point of view," said Christiani. "However, we're finding that even below 0.2 in some of our areas, the endotoxin level is high enough to cause some acute and chronic symptoms." <P>The idea that the endotoxin portion of the dust, and not simply the dust itself, is harmful to workers carries implications beyond the textile mill. There are many occupations in which a high level of endotoxin is present in the air--from agriculture and waste disposal to biotech laboratories that have a large amount of organic material. "Vegetable dusts and related substances are biologically quite active," Christiani said.<P>The trick is trying to separate out endotoxin's effects from those of other organic components. Donald Milton, HSPH lecturer on medicine at the Channing Laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital, identified respiratory decline in workers exposed to endotoxin through metalworking fluids and fiberglass, outside of an agricultural context. But he adds that methods to measure endotoxin levels are currently too expensive and unreliable for widespread use.<P>Bacterial endotoxin is just about everywhere at some level, but this rather mundane antigen has been generating a buzz of interest for its potential to be both friend and foe. Recent studies have suggested that children who are exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin through house pets may have a lower risk for allergies and asthma. Yet occupational studies clearly show that endotoxin exposure can be a health hazard. "Endotoxin is a very strange thing," said Milton. "We have lots of cellular mechanisms that respond to it." There seem to be different biological effects depending on age, dose, and what other compounds are inhaled with it. <P ALIGN="RIGHT"><I>--Courtney Humphries</I>
