(7) WHY IS IT GETTING COLDER DURING GLOBAL WARMING?</A> - From James Marusek<BR>
So why is it getting colder during Global Warming? The answer may lie in particle 
physics.
<BR>
Recently several individuals contributed to establishing a natural climate change model. 
These studies have focused on the Sun's influence on climate change. Pang & Yau (2002) 
studied solar irradiance and strongly correlated this data with Northern Hemisphere 
temperatures from the years 1620 to 1980. Willson (2003), using satellite observations 
of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), has observed a 0.05 percent increase per decade in the 
Sun's radiant energy <B>since 1970,</B> which can account for some of the uptick in 
global temperature rise. These studies provide a foundation for the development of a 
natural climate change model.
<BR>
Another component in the natural climate change model lies in particle physics. In 1894, 
Charles Wilson began researching water droplets that make up clouds. He developed a 
device called a cloud chamber, which allowed him to reduce the air pressure of a humid 
environment. He discovered that charged particles traveling through the chamber left a 
trail of condensed water droplets. He received a Nobel Prize in 1927 for inventing the 
bubble chamber.
<BR>
The Earth's environment functions like a cloud chamber. But the Earth's magnetic field 
shields the planet from charged particles, which are deflected towards the Poles, where 
the cold temperatures produce low humidity levels that inhibit cloud formation. The 
Earth's magnetic field has been on the decline. Recently, the decline has become very 
pronounced. Using the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) data set, the 
magnetic field at the equator in open ocean has declined 1.7 percent in intensity since 
1980. (Geomag program, IGRF dataset, latitude 0 degrees, longitude 180 degrees, sea 
level, years 1980-2005, a decline from 34,824 to 34,246 nanoTesla (nT)). Whereas the 
entire decline over the period from 1900 to 1980 was 2.8 percent.
<BR>
As the Earth's magnetic field weakens, charged particles from outer space and from the 
Sun will find it easier to break through the magnetic shield that protects Earth. These 
particles then interact with humid air in tropical, subtropical and mid-latitude 
environments to produce tiny water droplets that become basic building blocks in forming 
clouds. Increased cloud formation can result in increased global rainfall and snowfall 
totals. The clouds also moderate Earth's temperature by reflecting solar radiation.

WHY IS IT GETTING COLDER DURING GLOBAL WARMING?</A> - Part I<BR>
<I>An increase in the Sun's radiant energy (possibly starting around 1970 when

weakening of the Earth's magnetic field <B>may</B> account for current unusual

it was from shielding lower latitudes from an increased level of solar radiation 
particles, and these are interacting with Earth's atmosphere altering weather

MYSTERIOUS EARTH'S CORE PLUME SHIFTING THE MAGNETIC NORTH POLE</A> - Dec 27, 
2009<BR>
The north magnetic pole is moving at 37 miles-a-year toward Russia, which 
means they're stealing it. Or the Earth's core is fluxing. Actually, nobody 
really knows what's happening. I just hope it's not a prelude to a 
catastrophic magnetic shift.
<BR>
If the first theory finally happens, the whole process will have catastrophic 
consequences to human civilization and nature. Without a magnetic field, 
nothing will protect us against space radiation. The weather will go 
completely gaga, and the Sun will fry all our communications and navigation 
services, not to talk about all of us. At the same time, countless 
migrational species will get lost, affecting food chains and causing mayhem 
through the entire planet.

EARTH'S CORE, MAGNETIC FIELD CHANGING FAST, STUDY SAYS</A><BR>
Rapid changes in the churning movement of Earth's liquid outer core are 
weakening the magnetic field in some regions of the planet's surface, a new 
study says. "What is so surprising is that rapid, almost sudden, changes take 
place in the Earth's magnetic field."  The findings suggest similarly quick 
changes are simultaneously occurring in the liquid metal, 1,900 miles (3,000 
kilometers) below the surface. The swirling flow of molten iron and nickel 
around Earth's solid center triggers an electrical current, which generates the 
planet's magnetic field. 
<BR>
Fluctuations in the magnetic field have occurred in several far-flung regions of 
Earth, the researchers found. In 2003 scientists found pronounced changes in the 
magnetic field in the Australasian region. In 2004, however, the changes were 
focused on Southern Africa.

WILL COMPASSES POINT SOUTH?</A> The New York Times - July 13, 2004<BR>

The collapse of the Earth's magnetic field, which both guards the planet and 
guides many of its creatures, appears to have started in earnest about 150 years 
ago. The field's strength has waned 10 to 15 percent, and the deterioration has 
accelerated of late, increasing debate over whether it portends a reversal of 
the lines of magnetic force that normally envelop the Earth. <BR>

During a reversal, the main field weakens, almost vanishes, then reappears with 
opposite polarity. Afterward, compass needles that normally point north would 
point south, and during the thousands of years of transition, much in the 
heavens and Earth would go askew.<BR>

A reversal could knock out power grids, hurt astronauts and satellites, widen 
atmospheric ozone holes, send polar auroras flashing to the equator and confuse 
birds, fish and migratory animals that rely on the steadiness of the magnetic 
field as a navigation aid. But experts said the repercussions would fall short 
of catastrophic, despite a few proclamations of doom and sketchy evidence of 
past links between field reversals and species extinctions.<BR>

Although a total flip may be hundreds or thousands of years away, the rapid 
decline in magnetic strength is already damaging satellites.

Asteroid Strike Could Force Humans into Twilight Existence</A> - 26 October 
2010<BR>
An asteroid splashdown in one of Earth's oceans could trigger a destructive 
chemical cycle that would wipe out half the ozone layer, according to a new 
study. The massive loss of protection against the sun's ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation would likely force humans into a vampire-style existence of staying 
indoors during daylight hours. 
<BR>
Model results showed a 0.3-mile asteroid that hit at a latitude 30 degrees north 
in the Pacific Ocean in January would lead to a local impact on the ozone layer 
� though "local" still meant an ozone hole that spread across the entire 
Northern Hemisphere. By contrast, the 0.6-mile asteroid strike led to a 
worldwide drop in UV protection � at which point the "hole" ceases to be a hole.

OCEAN ASTEROID HITS WILL CREATE HUGE OZONE HOLES</A> - 13 October 2010<BR>
If a medium-sized asteroid lands in the ocean, tsunamis won't be the only worry. 
A new computer simulation suggests that the water vapour and sea salt thrown up 
by the impact could damage the Earth's protective ozone layer, leading to record 
levels of ultraviolet radiation that could threaten human civilisation.
<BR>
To get a sense of how much water might be jettisoned into the atmosphere if 
these asteroids hit the ocean, the team modelled what would happen if they 
reached Earth's atmosphere at a clip of 18 kilometres per second, an average 
speed expected for a near-Earth object, and hit the ocean in the northern 
hemisphere at a 45-degree angle.
<BR>
As expected, the simulations showed that the larger, 1-km asteroid created the 
bigger splash, throwing 42 trillion kilograms of water and vapour  � enough to 
fill 16 million Olympic-sized swimming pools  � across an area more than 1000 
kilometres wide and up to hundreds of kilometres above the Earth's surface.
<BR>
<BR>Engulfing Earth</B><BR>
Once in the atmosphere, the water, together with compounds containing chlorine 
and bromine from vaporised sea salts, destroyed ozone above the Earth's 
atmosphere at a much faster rate than it is naturally created.
<BR>
The longest lasting and most severe depletion � a cut of more than 70 per cent 
in ozone levels � occurred over much of the northern hemisphere.
<BR>
<B>Dry hits</B><BR>
While people may be able to protect themselves from the increased threat of 
sunburn, the intense UV light could also affect our food supply by damaging 
plants and the phytoplankton that represent the bottom of the ocean's food 
chain. "That is enough to really cause problems for our civilisation," Pierazzo 
says.
<BR>
Toon notes that impacts on land or shallow water may ultimately do more damage 
by kicking up dust that could significantly darken skies and inhibit plant 
growth. Pierazzo is now working on a model to assess how asteroids that hit dry 
land would affect the atmosphere.

such a phenomenon is thought to be physically impossible. The following article 
shows the possibility of very rapid  shifts of the poles due to the impact of 
astronomical objects as small as a half-kilometer diameter asteroid. <I>Acording 
to the Vulcan web site, the inner core of the Earth first changes its magnetic

An interesting aspect of his arguments is the derivation of the size of asteroid

WHEN THE EARTH SHIFTED GEARS</A>
No one really knows just how the terrestrial magnetic field is generated or why 
it has reversed its direction so frequently in past geological time. Perhaps 
there is a clue in the following correlation:<br>
Magnetic quiet periods coincide with fast seafloor spreading. During these 
periods, buoyant spreading ridges displace seawater into broad shelves, thus 
decreasing earth's albedo and causing global warming. Temperature gradients, and 
thus density gradients, from pole to equator decrease in surface waters, and the 
deep ocean currents of oxygenated polar waters wane. Oxygen minimum zones 
intensify and widens.

EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD JERKS</A>
It now seems almost certain that around 1969 a spectacular change took place in 
the geomagnetic field. The change was almost synchronous over the whole of the

consisted of a 'jerk'.

BEHIND MAGNETIC FLIP-FLOPS</A>
Taking a different tack, D. Gubbins has investigated the possibility that field 
reversals are triggered by ice ages and meteorite impacts (tektite falls). The 
physical mechanism here would be the increase in pressure upon the core, which 
affects the rate of freezing in the outer core, and thus the power available to 
the core dynamo.

EARTH'S CORE RUNS AHEAD OF CRUST</A><BR>
US scientists claim to have confirmed that the Earth's core is spinning faster 
than its outer layers. 
<BR>
The results show that the inner core is rotating faster than the rest of the 
planet by about 0.009 seconds per year. 
<BR>
Earth has a solid inner core made of iron and nickel that is about 2,400km in 
diameter and a fluid outer core about 7,000km in diameter. 
<BR>
This so-called "superrotation" of the inner core is of the order of 0.3 degrees

gain one full rotation on the rest of the planet.

One of the reasons the loss of the planet's ice cover is accelerating is that as 
the poles' bright white surface disappears it changes the relationship of the 
Earth and the sun. Polar ice is so reflective that 90 percent of the sunlight 
that strikes it simply bounces back into space, taking its energy with it. Ocean 
water does just the opposite, absorbing 90 percent of the light and heat it 
receives, meaning that each mile of ice that melts vanishes faster than the mile

"On the face of it, global warming can only make things worse," says science

humid air generally forms only when the temperature of the sea surface exceeds 
26C. As the oceans warm, larger areas will exceed the threshold. And every 
degree above the threshold seems to encourage stronger hurricanes," he says.

More fuel was added to the fire of the debate in September when meteorologist

Judging from the large magnitude and relatively rapid evolution of the observed 
J-2 changes, one possible cause could be net material flow driven by the 
geodynamo in the fluid outer core and along the core-mantle boundary. There is 
evidence of a substantial geomagnetic jerk in 1999. Such jerks have been 
associated with flow acceleration in the top of the core, in addition to long-
term magnetic dipole changes. Could they be related? To date, no correlation has 
been demonstrated between the geomagnetic observations and the observed J2 . 
However, a review of geodynamo simulation results indicates that the core models 
can possibly explain J-2 changes ?depending on the modeling assumptions."

POLE SHIFT & POLE REVERSAL IN 2012</A><BR>
So, what do our professors indeed know? Next to nothing. In short, the scenario 
is as follows: a solid central core rotates in the center of the earth. It is 
surrounded by a liquid iron-like layer, on top of which the earth's crust is 
continuously drifting. This whole structure therefore appears to be a huge 
rotating dynamo. In addition, the liquid layer rotates in the electrostatic 
field of the sun, recharging itself. 
<BR>
However, this is not at all efficient: more electrical potential is lost than 
gained. Just like a battery that is almost empty, it is difficult to recharge 
and it becomes exhausted more easily and quickly. This is the situation with the 
"battery" of the magnetic field of the earth. For this reason one sees the force 
of the magnetic field diminishing, almost 60% over the last two thousand years.

After centuries in Canada, the roaming magnetic North Pole has crossed into 
international waters, en route to Siberia
<BR>
The pole, which, unlike the geographic North Pole, is in constant movement, has 
been within modern Canadian borders since at least the 1600s -- the time of 
Shakespeare and Sir Isaac Newton.
<BR>
In 1904 it was measured just off the northern tip of Nunavut's King William 
Island by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, and since then has moved in a north 
to northwesterly direction at a stately 10 kilometres per year.
<BR>
But in 2001, scientists discovered that it was picking up the pace, suddenly 
charging ahead -- and toward the edge of Canadian territory -- at more than 40 
kilometres per year.
<BR>
This year, bad weather prevented Newitt from reaching the actual location of the 
pole, and he hasn't completed the analysis of his observations. But he got close 
enough to make two measurements, and says it appears the pole is farther away 
than expected, and moving even faster than before.
<BR>
"We landed at two places at around 83 North, and it certainly appears the pole 
is probably closer to 84 North," he said. "That means that the pole is still 
continuing to accelerate."
<BR>
If the pole continues its current course, it will shoot across the top of Earth 
and end up in Siberia by mid-century.

But there is also evidence for more frequent episodes when the magnetic poles

Professor Gubbins has drawn on recent experimental results, particularly those

(7) "EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD WASN'T ALWAYS WHAT WE HAVE ASSUMED"</A> - 21 
December 2000<BR>

Now, Van der Voo and colleague Trond Torsvik of the Geological Survey of
Norway have found a way to reconcile the paleomagnetic data with the
classical Pangea A model. The key, they say, lies in assumptions about
Earth's magnetic field. Scientists generally have assumed the field is like
that of a dipole, an object such as a bar magnet, with north and south
magnetic poles. That view is not exactly correct -- the field does have some
non-dipole components today -- but because those components vary from
century to century, they have been presumed to cancel out over long spans of
time.<BR>

But suppose, says Van der Voo, "that the main magnetic field wasn't what we
have always assumed as perfectly dipolar -- that there was a longstanding
non-dipolar field that did not get averaged out." If that were true,
positions indicated by paleomagnetic data would be slightly different from
those that assume a purely dipolar field. Sure enough, when Van der Voo and
Torsvik performed an analysis they found long-term non-dipole fields, and
inclusion of these fields produced a near perfect continental fit with the
Pangea A model.

The edges of the Antarctic ice sheets are crumbling at an unprecedented rate, 
says Andy Shepherd of the University of Cambridge. In one area, around the 
Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica, the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are 
dumping more than 110 cubic kilometres of ice each year. Warmer ocean waters 
circulating beneath the two glaciers are <B>melting their bases</B> and triggering 
an ever-faster slide into the ocean.

"BOREHOLE" DATA SUGGEST EARTH'S WARMING AT FASTER PACE</A><BR>
Harris and Chapman examined temperature data from boreholes throughout the 
Northern Hemisphere, which helps eliminate regional anomalies in their findings. 
They estimate that the Earth has warmed 1.1 degrees C. over the past 500 years - 
more than double the 0.4- to 0.5-degree estimates suggested by most tree-ring 
analysis.
<BR>
In their article, they say the difference may be that tree-ring analysis 
primarily reflects temperatures when trees are actively growing during the warm 
season, but doesn't reflect changes in winter temperatures. Much of the annual 
warming recorded by instruments over the past 100 years has occurred during the 
winter season, they add.

More immediately, the vast amount of fresh water discharged into the ocean as

An interesting aspect of his arguments is the derivation of the size of asteroid 
needed to cause a polar shift. The way in which Dr. Barbiero determines the size 
of the impactor needed to cause pole shifting is not only incorrect, but it

Based on what [Tollmanns] claim to have found in the historical record, and 
comparing that with modern calculations of the consequence of a major collision, 
they conjure up the following picture of events. Immediately following a series 
of impacts, there was a great heat pulse produced by the fireballs. As a result 
of flood and fire, much of the world was left in ruins. Many of the ancient 
stories also tell of earthquakes of enormous magnitude. "<B>The crust moved,</B> 
according to these traditions, like the running high waves of the tempestuous

with staggering speed -- at least by geological standards. Africa will 
eventually lose its horn.

They noticed a region beneath Asia where seismic waves appeared to dampen, or 
"attenuate," and also slow down slightly. "Water slows the speed of waves a 
little," Wysession explained. "Lots of damping and a little slowing match the 
predictions for water very well."
<BR>
Although they appear solid, the composition of some ocean floor rocks is up to 
15 percent water. "The water molecules are actually stuck in the mineral 
structure of the rock," Wysession explained. "As you heat this up, it eventually 
dehydrates. It's like taking clay and firing it to get all the water out."
<BR>
The researchers estimate that up to 0.1 percent of the rock sinking down into 
the Earth's mantle in that part of the world is water, which works out to about 
an Arctic Ocean's worth of water.
<BR>
Wysession has dubbed the new underground feature the "Beijing anomaly," because 
seismic wave attenuation was found to be highest beneath the Chinese capital 
city. Wysession first used the moniker during a presentation of his work at the 
University of Beijing.
<BR>
Water covers 70 percent of Earth's surface and one of its many functions is to 
act like a lubricant for the movement of continental plates.

"Look at our sister planet, Venus," Wysession said. "It is very hot and dry 
inside Venus, and Venus has no plate tectonics. All the water probably boiled 
off, and without water, there are no plates. The system is locked up, like a 
rusty Tin Man with no oil."

we will be experiencing a cold period similar to the �Little Ice Age� that 
enveloped the world between about 1550 AD and 1850 AD. During that time, global 
temperatures were up to 2 degrees F colder than now and that chill had a 
significant effect on food production.

ICE AGE THEORIES WARMING UP</A> -  30 April 2010<BR>
One of the more interesting results from recent research into climate is that 
for the past million years or so, the earth�s climate has shown a distinct 
100,000 cycle of long ice ages punctuated by a brief, warm intergalacials. We 
are in one of those brief warm periods, an interglacial period that is called 
the Holocene.
<center>
<img src="/marklawson-ice-ages.jpg">
<BR>
Temperatures over the most recent 420,000 years of earth�s history.<BR> 
The zero line is just a handy reference point, it has nothing to do with the freezing point of water.
</center>
<BR>
As you can see climate changes by about 14 degrees C from the top of the 
interglacial to the bottom of the ice age, but even the 420,000 or so years 
covered by the Vostok cores is just a moment in earth�s geological history. As 
noted, the 100,000 year cycle has been a feature of climate for about a million 
years. For two million years before that the cycle was the same except that it 
was 40,000 years long and temperatures were warmer. The whole three million 
years, in turn, is part of an ice age phase of the earth in which temperatures 
have generally been falling. There have also been hot house phases.
<BR>
Scientists have no real idea why the earth has been cooling over the past three 
million years and, in particular, are puzzled over the shift from 40,000 to 
100,000 cycles. 
<BR>
Another glance at the graph indicates that temperatures in the previous two 
interglacials seem to spike to well above modern temperatures, but the ice core 
readings for the time show that CO2 levels were at about 300 parts per million 
or far less than present levels.. . . The 2007 IPCC report says that polar 
temperatures at the time were 3 to 5 degrees higher than now,   
<BR>
As you can see from the graph the Holocene is already longer than the preceding 
three interglacial periods at least. Estimating from graphs that are better than 
mine, the Eemian lasted less than 10,000 years and the previous two 
interglacials lasted perhaps just 5,000 years. The Holocene, in contrast, has 
clocked up 10,000 years plus. Further, those 10,000 years have remained 
comparatively warm, in contrast to the previous interglacials in which 
temperatures spiked then fell away again very quickly. In all cases the final 
collapse into an ice age has been abrupt - perhaps just a few generations. The 
atmosphere-oceanic system just seems to trip over itself to fall 10 degrees and 
more, and with climate theory in its present state there is no way to predict 
when it will occur.

There is also plenty of anecdotal evidence that 2007 was exceptionally cold. It 
snowed in Baghdad for the first time in centuries, the winter in China was 
simply terrible and the extent of Antarctic sea ice in the austral winter was 
the greatest on record since James Cook discovered the place in 1770. 
<BR>
It is time to put aside the global warming dogma, at least to begin contingency 
planning about what to do if we are moving into another little ice age, similar 
to the one that lasted from 1100 to 1850. 
<BR>
The interglacial we have enjoyed throughout recorded human history, called the 
Holocene, began 11,000 years ago, so the ice is overdue. We also know that 
glaciation can occur quickly: the required decline in global temperature is 
about 12C and it can happen in 20 years. 
<BR>
The next descent into an ice age is inevitable but may not happen for another 
1000 years. On the other hand, it must be noted that the cooling in 2007 was 
even faster than in typical glacial transitions. If it continued for 20 years, 
the temperature would be 14C cooler in 2027. 
<BR>
By then, most of the advanced nations would have ceased to exist, vanishing 
under the ice, and the rest of the world would be faced with a catastrophe 
beyond imagining.

It is unlikely humans exterminated the immense marsupial Diprotodon and other

Two new studies reject the theory that humans moving on to the continent more

the Thames. England would become like Greenland: capable of supporting marginal

NEW CLIMATE STUDY CHALLENGES THINKING ON LARGE-SCALE, GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE</A><BR>

A study of past climate changes in the South American tropics has challenged
traditional understanding of the mechanisms that triggered the advance and
retreat of glaciers  during the last ice age. The National Science
Foundation (NSF) funded study was published in this week's issue of Science.<BR>

A research team found that glaciers in the tropical Andes Mountains
retreated several thousand years earlier than North American glaciers during
a period of wet climate conditions, and during a time when the sun's warming
radiation (solar insolation) was at a minimum.<BR>

The finding contradicts traditional thinking that climate conditions in the
northern latitudes generate the advance and retreat of global glaciation,
and that glaciers retreated during dry climate conditions and when solar
insolation was at its maximum, said lead researcher Geoffrey Seltzer of
Syracuse University. "If the tropics warmed earlier than the northern
latitudes, as our study demonstrates, that means there is  something else
influencing climate change that we don't yet understand."

SUNSPOTS REACHING 1,000-YEAR HIGH</A><BR>
Scientists based at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich used ice cores from 
Greenland to construct a picture of our star's activity in the past.  They say 
that over the last century the number of sunspots rose at the same time that the 
Earth's climate became steadily warmer. In particular, it has been noted that 
between about 1645 and 1715, few sunspots were seen on the Sun's surface.  This 
period is called the Maunder Minimum after the English astronomer who 
studied it. But the most striking feature, he says, is that looking at the past 
1,150 years the Sun has never been as active as it has been during the past 60 
years.  Over the past few hundred years, there has been a steady increase in the 
numbers of sunspots, a trend that has accelerated in the past century, just at 
the time when the Earth has been getting warmer. The data suggests that changing 
solar activity is influencing in some way the global climate causing the world 
to get warmer.  Over the past 20 years, however, the number of sunspots has 
remained roughly constant, yet the average temperature of the Earth has 
continued to increase.

CCNet-ESSAY: ON THE CAUSE OF ICE-AGES</A><BR>
By Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe

      "The renewal of ice-age conditions would render a 
      large fraction of the world's major food-growing 
      areas inoperable, and so would inevitably lead to the 
      extinction of most of the present human population. 
      Since bolide impacts cannot be called up to order, we 
      must look to a sustained greenhouse effect to 
      maintain the present advantageous world climate.      
      This implies the ability to inject effective      
      greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the opposite of 
      what environmentalists are erroneously advocating."
<BR><BR>
During the ice-ages the whole Earth was cooled, including the tropics.  
This is proved by glaciers extending down to about 10,000 feet on 
tropical mountains, mountains which at present do not hold glaciers, 
such as the mountains on the island of Hawaii.

66-FOOT WAVES HIT NEW YORK IN ANCIENT ASTEROID SPLASHDOWN</A> - 26 October

Now researchers have evidence suggesting that an asteroid roughly 200 yards (183 
meters) wide crashed off the coast of New Jersey and sent tsunamis surging 
toward what is now New York City some 2,300 years ago.
<BR>
"Our models suggest the tsunamis were up to 20 meters (66 feet) high when they 
entered the Hudson River," said researcher Dallas Abbott, a geologist at 
Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York. 
<BR>
New York City lies at the mouth of the Hudson. When the scientists drilled out 
tubes of sediment from the New York and New Jersey area, they discovered layers 
of unusual debris that, they suggest, were laid down by tsunamis. 
<BR>
"We have layers up to maybe 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) thick," Abbott said. 
"They get thinner upriver, where they're more like 6 centimeters (2.3 inches) 
thick."

When I first started with all this, my intention was to see if I could figure

meteorite hunting. I didn�t do so well at first. But ironically, when I quit 
looking for new craters, and started focusing on identifying formations of

NEED FOR A NEW RISK ASSESSMENT FOR AIRBURST IMPACTS?</A><BR>
Most evaluations of the risks of asteroid or comet impacts state that 
there is little danger associated with those many cases where the  
object explodes in the air and never reaches the ground (Chapman and
Morrison 1994). There is only significant global risk  in those rare
cases where a large object hits the surface - less than once per 
100,000 years. However, the experience of the last 100,000 years has 
been a large number of climate excursions  overlapped by the beginning 
and end of an ice age. The ice age climate excursions occurred about 
every <B>3,000 years</B> with differences in mean temperatures of up 
to 7 degrees  centigrade (Dansgaard et al 1993).  
<BR><BR>
Climate excursions on a smaller scale have also characterized the 
latest 6,000 years. This has been shown by decade long, worldwide  
narrowing of tree rings (Baillie 1995, 1999). Baillie has described at
least 6 well dated episodes: 540 AD, 44 BC, 207 BC, 1159 BC, 1628 BC
and 2345 BC. Only the episode 1628 BC can be explained by volcanism:
the explosion of Santorini north of  Crete destroying the minoan 
civilization. The AD 540 event lasting from 536-545 is best described
in the historical records; it involved reduced sunlight, mists or 
"dry" fogs, crop failures, famines in China and the Mediterranean, and
plagues. 
<BR><BR>
The impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy on Jupiter was a series of high 
airbursts resulting in huge plumes covering tens of thousands of km 
squared. The plumes were extremely black ("gunk"), they were visible
for months and the particle haze in the Jupiter  atmosphere has remained
for years (Friedson et al 1999).

NATURAL CLIMATE CHANGE PERIODICALLY WIPES OUT MAMMAL SPECIES: STUDY</A><BR>
Palaeontologists have long puzzled over fossil records that, remarkably, suggest 
mammal species tend to last around two and a half million years before becoming

One wave of extinction was roughly every 2.4 million years or so and the other 
was about every million years or so, coinciding with extremes in the cycles of 
ellipticality, wobble and tilt.

Therefore, I would add to your thesis some relevant ideas about human

at least 20 globally devastating cosmic catastrophes during the last 5
million years. The impacts surely caused significant climate downturns,
reduction in the ozone layer, severe acid rain, and the global distribution
of toxins. However, these catastrophes should not always be looked on as
evolutionarily detrimental. In fact, providing the devastations didn't wipe
out all life or severely restrict it, the catastrophes probably propelled
our ancestors to adapt genetically and socially to the changing environment.<BR>

Episodes of cometary or asteroidal impacts punctuate natural as well as human

PHYSICS EXPLAINS HUGE VARIANCE IN TSUNAMI IMPACTS </A><BR>
In a nutshell, Weissel and others said, land masses that poke abruptly from the 
deep ocean experience tsunamis as diffusely rising tides, while those bounded by 
shallower seas get hit by higher, steeper and often more destructive waves. 
<BR>
At the core of this truth -- as with most truths in physics -- is an equation: v 
square root (g times h), where v is the wave's velocity, g is the force of 
gravity and h is the depth of the water. In plain English, as the water gets 
shallower, waves slow down.

Cold War). The comet itself would be almost instantaneously vaporized, along

<LI> Hotspots, in the case of Tr-J this is presumably at the Azores.

America, Africa, and Europe where all connected.

<LI> Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs): This massive killer impact that wiped out

In the case of the Yellowstone hotspot, these supervolcano eruptions occurred at 
intervals greater than several 100 thousand years ago. The hotspot probably

If you thought the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 was a big one, it's 
possible you ain't seen nothing yet.

According to an article in NewScientist, there may be a "super volcano" brewing 
under the mountain, which has been steaming and stewing since its notorious 
eruption on May 18, 1980. 
<BR>
If the structure beneath the three volcanoes is indeed a vast bubble of 
partially molten rock, it would be comparable in size to the biggest magma 
chambers ever discovered, such as the one below Yellowstone National Park.
<BR>
Every few hundred thousand years, such chambers can erupt as so-called 
supervolcanoes - the Yellowstone one did so about 640,000 years ago. These 
enormous eruptions can spew enough sunlight-blocking ash into the atmosphere to 
cool the climate by several degrees Celsius.

<LI><A HREF = "http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/11/071108-
yellowstone.html">YELLOWSTONE IS RISING ON SWOLLEN SUPERVOLCANO</A><BR>
Yellowstone National Park is rising. Its central region, called the Yellowstone 
caldera, has been moving upward since mid-2004 at a rate of up to three inches 
(seven centimeters) a year�more than three times faster than has ever been 
measured. The surface is inflating like a bellows due to an infusion of magma 
about 6 miles (10 kilometers) underground, according to a new study published in 
tomorrow's issue of the journal Science. 
<BR>
Yellowstone is situated on a giant, geologically active feature known as a 
supervolcano. "It's hundreds of times bigger than Mount St. Helens," Smith said, 
referring to the active volcano in Washington State. Much of the park sits in a 
caldera, or crater, some 40 miles (70 kilometers) across, which formed when the 
cone of the massive volcano collapsed in a titanic eruption 640,000 years ago. 
The supervolcano has produced three similarly large blasts in the past two 
million years, with 30 smaller eruptions since the caldera formed. 
The volcano's <B>most recent flare-up was 70,000 years ago,</B> and volcanic 
heat continues to fuel the park's famous geysers and hot springs. 
<BR>
The land is rising because magma and hydrothermal fluids are migrating into the 
volcano's underground chambers, Smith explained. "It's really kind of a sponge, 
where you have interlaced open spaces with magma and solid rock between. Only 10 
percent [of the chambers are] actually made up of molten rock." 
<BR>
"Since ?about 14,000 years ago, the Yellowstone caldera has inflated and 
deflated about six to eight times without a volcanic eruption," he said. 
Smith agreed. "Calderas go up and down," he said. "We use the term 'restless' to 
describe these systems." But, he added, "occasionally they burp."

YELLOWSTONE RATED HIGH FOR ERUPTION THREAT</A><BR>
Yellowstone ranks 21st most dangerous of the 169 volcano centers in the United 
States, according to the Geological Survey's first-ever comprehensive review of 
the nation's volcanoes.
<BR>
The USGS report recognizes Yellowstone as an unusual hazard because of the 
millions of people who visit the park and walk amid features created by North 
America's largest volcanic system,

CATASTROPHE</A><BR>
"Yellowstone is known to have erupted cataclysmically on three occasions in the 
past: 2 million years ago, when it spewed out nearly 600 cubic miles of magma; 
1.3 million years ago, when it ejected 'just' 70 cubic miles of the stuff; and 
630,000 years ago, when it generated about 250 cubic miles of magma. There has 
been much recent publicity about the possibility of a meteor or comet strike - 
like the one credited with wiping out the dinosaurs - and various contingency 
plans have been offered in national and even international forums. Surely we 
should not fail, while scanning the skies, to consider what is right here 
underfoot."

(4) MORE BLASTS FROM THE YELLOWSTONE PAST</A><BR>

Hotspot Generated 142 Huge Eruptions, 40 Percent More Than Previously Known<BR>

The Yellowstone hotspot, which powers Yellowstone National Park's geysers and 
hot springs, produced 142 huge volcanic eruptions during the last 16.5 million 
years - far more than the 100 previously known blasts, University of Utah 
geologists found.<BR> 

The cataclysmic explosions -- known as "caldera eruptions" -- typically 
generated 250 to 600 times as much volcanic ash as the 1980 eruption of Mount 
St. Helens in Washington state, and some were up to 2,500 times larger, covering 
as much as half the continental United States with inches to feet of volcanic 
ash. <BR>
 
The Yellowstone hotspot - which many scientists believe is a plume-like zone of 
hot and molten rising from at least 125 miles beneath Earth's surface - produced 
its three most recent caldera eruptions at or near the present site of 
Yellowstone National Park 2 million, 1.3 million and 642,000 years ago.

That 600 km radius around the caldera will experience total devastation. The 
next 600 km out may receive as much as 5-10 feet of ash, depending on wind 
direction. The thickness of ash will decrease away from the super-volcano, but 
will reach the crop belt in the Midwest (Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, 
etc.), destroying most of the fertile croplands of the United States. California 
will be hit hard by falling ash, with its central wine valley severely damaged. 
Agriculture will have to shift east of the Mississippi for years.

The magma chamber is believed to be about 40 by 80 kilometers across, similar in 
size to the overlying Yellowstone caldera. The top of the chamber is about 8 km

TRACKING THE GIANT</A><BR>
The seismic network has recently revealed a 3,600-cubic-mile banana-shaped body 
located a half-mile to several miles underneath part of Yellowstone. This 
chamber slows down seismic waves, which means it could contain 10 to 20 percent 
melted rock, Smith says.
<BR>
And a broader seismic array has just recently revealed an even deeper feature: a 
tilted pipe rising up through the Earth from the northwest, from 400 miles down.
<BR>
"It's this pipe that's bending over in the wind," says Ihinger. "That is at the 
heart of the matter." The "pipe" appears to be the track of a slow, viscous 
upwelling of hot rock from below the crust. The upwelling could cause rocks in 
the crust to melt, creating the magma chamber below Yellowstone.

SCIENTISTS, IN THEIR OWN WORDS...</A><BR>
<B>Crustal Deformation of the Yellowstone Caldera...1923-2000</B><BR>
C. Meertens, and Others reveal that there was an unexpected sinking of the 
caldera between 1985 and 1995, after unprecedented caldera uplift between 1923 
and 1985. Since 1995, measurements show that Yellowstone's volcanically and 
seismically active area may once again be causing caldera uplift. That is, hot-
spot mantle material beneath Yellowstone may be beginning to rise again. 
<B>Hutton's commentary on CATASTROPHE! The Day The Sun Went Out</B><BR>
A Syrian bishop, John of Ephesis, described the extraordinary events of 535-536 
A. D., as follows:<BR>

"There was a sign from the Sun, the likes of which had never been seen or 
reported before. The Sun became dark, and its darkness lasted for about 18 
months. Each day, it shown for about four hours and still this light was only a 
feeble shadow. Everyone declared that the Sun would never recover its full light 
again." <BR>
(Perhaps this is why Cayce readings 3620-1 and 257-254 say that "anyone who can 
should buy a farm, and buy it if you don't want to grow hungry in some days to 
come," for "the hardships for [America] have not yet begun, so far as the supply 
and demand for foods are concerned").

<LI><A HREF = "http://exodus2006.com/yellow2.htm">
COST OF LOSING YELLOWSTONE</A><BR>
"When Yellowstone goes off again, and it will, it will be a disaster for the 
United States and eventually, for the whole world.  We volcanologists believe it 
would all begin with the magma chamber becoming unstable.  Observations would 
begin by seeing bigger earthquakes, greater uplifting as magma intrudes and gets 
nearer and nearer the surface.  An earthquake may send a rupture through a 
brittle layer similar to breaking the lid off a pressure cooker.  This would 
generate sheets of magma, which will perhaps rise up to 30, 40 or 50 kilometers 
sending gigantic amounts of debris into the atmosphere.  Pyroclastic flows would 
cover the whole region, killing tens of thousands of people in the surrounding 
area.<BR>

The ash carried in the atmosphere and deposited over vast areas of the United 
States would have devastating effects.  A plume of material that goes up into 
the atmosphere, globally, from the eruption would produce the climatic effects.  
This would spread worldwide and have a cooling effect that would most likely 
destroy the growing season on a global scale.<BR>

The eruption will throw out cubic kilometers of rock, ash, dust, sulfur dioxide 
and so on into the upper atmosphere, where it will reflect incoming solar 
radiation, forcing down temperatures on the earth's surface.  It would be the 
equivalent of a nuclear winter.  The effects would last for four or five years 
with crops failing and the whole ecosystem breaking down."

If these 65 ash layers (organic levels) were laid down over a long time span, 
the ash that was laid down thousands of years later near the end of the series 
of ash eruptions would have changed sufficiently to produce a new and different 
trace element profile. This has not been the case. Quick burial of the whole 
sequence seems to be required. Two of the sources for the ash appear to be 
Electric Peak in the northwest comer of Yellowstone Park and Lone Mountain 48 km

WHEN WAS THE ERUPTION THAT TRANSFORMED YELLOWSTONE FROM A VOLCANO TO A STEAMING, 
BOILING, CALDERA?</A><BR>
Yellowstone is the result of three very large eruptions. The first was about 2.1 
million years ago and erupted 600 cubic miles (2,500 cubic km) of ash. It 
created the Island Park caldera about 45 miles (75 km) long. The second eruption 
was about 1.3 million years ago. It produced the Henrys Fork caldera in the west 
end of the older (2.1 million year) caldera. About 600,000 years ago an eruption 
produced about 250 cubic miles (1,000 cubic km) of ash and the present-day 
Yellowstone caldera. Since then there have been large volume (250 cubic miles; 
1,000 cubic km) rhyolitic lava flows between 150,000 and 70,000 years ago. 
Yellowstone is still an active volcano. It sits above a hot spot and will erupt 
again.

SUPER-VOLCANO THREAT OVER FAULTLINE</A><BR>
AS IF earthquake-ravaged Indonesia doesn't have enough to worry about, now 
scientists warn that a Sumatran super-volcano might blow its top at any time.
If it does, the blast will toss hundreds of thousands of cubic kilometres of 
rock and ash into the atmosphere, dwarfing the eruptions of Krakatoa, Mount St 
Helens, Pinatubo and any conventional volcanic explosion of the past tens of 
thousands of years. "These super-volcanoes are potentially the greatest hazard 
on Earth, the only greater threat being an asteroid impact from space," said Ray 
Cas, a vulcanologist with Monash University in Melbourne.
<BR>
The likelihood that the Toba - the largest super-volcano on Earth - will erupt 
has increased significantly due to geological stresses generated by the recent 
quakes. Worse, Toba sits directly atop the faultline running down the spine of 
Sumatra. That is where seismologists say a third quake might strike. 
Vulcanologist Stephen Self of Britain's Open University said a super-
volcanic eruption might cover an entire continent with ash that could take 
decades to erode. "(Such an eruption) could result in the devastation of 
world agriculture, severe disruption of food supplies and mass 
starvation," he told the online journal Live Science.

The likelihood that the Toba ?the largest super-volcano on Earth ?will erupt 
has increased significantly due to geological stresses generated by the recent 
quakes. Worse, Toba sits directly atop the faultline running down the spine of 
Sumatra. That is where seismologists say a third quake might strike.

CATASTROPHE: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGINS OF THE MODERN WORLD (David Keys, 
1999)</A><BR> 
Keys examines phenomena that could mess with the weather world-wide. He lays out 
reasons to believe that a meteor or comet impact wouldn't do the job, and this 
is more convincing than I was expecting it to be. I, um, I didn't take into 
account that of course an impact event has its biggest consequences very very 
rapidly, while the sort of long-lasting injection of weather-messing crud he 
describes requires a cause that isn't spent all at once. He proposes a volcanic 
eruption, and has a candidate in mind: a particular volcano in Sumatra. The 
Sumatran history he uses to support the claim seems relatively weak to me, 
though that might be presentation, but the geology is sound. He concludes by 
summarizing the effects of this sort of big eruption and applying them to a 
prospective eruption of the Yellowstone volcano in the near future.

GENETIC EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HUMANS NEARLY WENT EXTINCT</A><BR>
This is interesting news. If the conclusions the researchers have reached is 
correct, might this near extinction be linked to the catastrophic eruption and 
aftermath of the super-volcano Toba in Sumatra (around 72,000 BCE)?

ANCIENT 'VOLCANIC WINTER' TIED TO RAPID GENETIC 
DIVERGENCE IN HUMANS</A> - September 1998<BR> 

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -- A new hypothesis about recent human evolution 
suggests that a horrific "volcanic winter" 71,000 years ago, followed 
by the coldest 1,000 years of the last Ice Age, brought widespread 
famine and death to modern human populations around the world. The 
abrupt "bottleneck," or decrease, in our ancestors' populations, in 
turn, brought about the rapid "differentiation" - or genetic 
divergence - of the surviving populations.<BR>

The hypothesis, offered by anthropologist Stanley Ambrose of the 
University of Illinois, proposes that a volcanic winter reduced 
populations to <B>"levels low enough for evolutionary changes, which 
occur much faster in small populations, to produce rapid population 
differentiation"</B><BR> 

Ambrose has linked geneticists' research to that of volcanologists Michael 
Rampino, Stephen Self, Greg Zielinski and colleagues, which shows the 
super-eruption of Toba caused a volcanic winter that lasted six years 
and significantly altered global climate for the next 1,000 years. 
Those six years of "relentless volcanic winter" led to substantial 
lowering of global temperatures, drought and famine, and to a global 
human population crash during which, if geneticists are correct, no 
more than 15,000 to 40,000 people survived. 

<I>Whether volcano or comet strike induced, this weather changecould have been 
what killed off the bulk of the Neanderthals and offered an opportunity for 
modern man to establish a foot hold on Earth a few tens thousand of years 
later.</I>
