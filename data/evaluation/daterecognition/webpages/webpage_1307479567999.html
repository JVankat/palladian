			<p>Dick Durbin knows his way around the Senate. He's been there a long time, long enough to know how things really work. Over the years, the man from Illinois has come to realize that it's not the elected officials who are in charge. Last week, he said it was the bankers &quot;who run the place&quot; acknowledging that Senators may be in office, but not necessarily in power.  </p><p>Usually, the people who pull the strings stay in the background to avoid too much public exposure. They rely on lobbyists to do their bidding. They prefer to work in the shadows. They may back certain politicians, but coming from a world of credit default swaps as they do, they hedge their bets by putting money on all the horses.  </p><p>They have so much influence because they have been reengineering the American economy for decades through &quot;financialization,&quot; a process by which banks and financial institutions gradually came to dominate economic and political decision-making.  Kevin Phillips, a one time Reagan advisor and commentator,  says our deepest problem is &quot;the ascendancy of finance in national policymaking (as well as in the gross domestic product), and the complicity of politicians who really don't want to talk about it.&quot;</p><p>Curiously, despite the journalists like Bill Moyers and Arianna Huffington who have been blowing the whistle on the role of the &quot;banksters&quot; in our political life, criticizing the Republicans and Democrats who deregulated the financial system, this issue seems to float above the heads of most of the public, much of the press, and even the activist community more drawn to punishing the torture inflicted on a few by a former Administration than the economic duress being imposed on the majority of Americans by a minority of the super rich.   </p><p>Demonstrators are still drawn more to the White House than the banks that have proliferated on every corner of the country. </p><p>Last week, a Zogby poll found that a majority of the public believes the press made things worse by reporting on the economic collapse. Not only is that blaming the messenger, it also overlooks the fact that much of the media was complicit in the crisis by not covering  the forces that caused the collapse when it might have done some good. </p><p>Exacerbating the problem is that the Obama Administration has, in Robert Scheer's words, enlisted &quot;the very experts who helped trigger the crisis to try to fix it.&quot;  </p><p>&quot;Obama,&quot; he writes &quot;seems depressingly reliant on the same-old, same old cast of self-serving house wreckers who act as if government exists for the sole benefit of corporations and executives.&quot;  </p><p>The team of Tim Geithner and Larry Summers has been carrying Wall Street's water as Robert Rubin did before them. No wonder that Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder told the Street last February, &quot;We're not going to go on any witch hunts.&quot; </p><p>That was before we learned that Wall Street forced US regulators to delay the release of stress test results for the country's 19 biggest banks until next Thursday, because some of the lenders objected to government demands that they needed to raise more capital. They are trying to rig the results. </p><p>That was also before the public learned of the obscenely huge bonuses the firms benefiting from the TARP bailout were shelling out to their executives. That was before we saw how the bankers with help from Democrats, including new convert Arlen Spector,  managed to kill a bill to help homeowners stop foreclosures.</p><p>&quot;The Senate on Thursday rejected an effort to stave off home foreclosures by a vote of 51 to 45. It was an overwhelming defeat, with the bill's backers falling 15 votes short -- a quarter of the Democratic caucus -- of the 60 needed to cut off debate and move to a final vote. Across the United States, the measure is estimated to have been able to prevent 1.69 million foreclosures and preserve $300 billion in home equity.&quot;   </p><p>Commented the Center for Responsible Lending, &quot;Instead of defending ordinary Americans, the majority of Senators went with the banks.  Yes, the same banks who have benefited so richly from the TARP bailout.&quot; </p><p>There was one small victory with the House approving a bill to protect consumers from credit card abuses. It's not clear if the Senate will pass it too. &quot;It's one step forward and one step backward,&quot; said Travis Plunkett, of the Consumer Federation of America. &quot;Congress is moving in fits and starts to re-regulate the financial services industry and the banking lobby still has tremendous clout.&quot;  </p><p>&quot;Tremendous clout&quot; is an understatement. </p><p>In this past week, we also saw how a few hedge funds undermined the attempt to save Chrysler from bankruptcy by holding out for more money even after the unions and big banks agreed to compromise to save jobs.</p><p>The President was furious but apparently powerless: &quot;A group of investment firms and hedge funds decided to hold out for the prospect of an unjustified taxpayer-funded bailout,&quot; Obama said. &quot;They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrifices, and they would have to make none. Some demanded twice the return that other lenders were getting.&quot;</p><p>Explains the blog Naked Capitalism, &quot;the banksters are eagerly, shamelessly, and openly harvesting their pound of flesh from financially stressed average taxpayers, and setting off a chain reaction in the auto industry which has the very real risk of creating even larger scale unemployment than the economy already faces. It's reckless, utterly irresponsible, over-the-top greed.&quot;</p><p>Will they be allowed to get away with it? A &quot;captured&quot; Congress is doing their bidding. There is no doubt that class antagonism is stewing,  says the editor of the blog. He expressed a fear of a reaction that will go way beyond flag-wavng tea parties.</p><p>&quot;... I am concerned this behavior is setting the stage for another sort of extra-legal measure: violence. I have been amazed at the vitriol directed at the banking classes. Suggestions for punishment have included the guillotine (frequent), hanging, pitchforks, even burning at the stake. Tar and feathering appears inadequate, and stoning hasn't yet surfaced as an idea. And mind you, my readership is educated, older, typically well-off (even if less so than three years ago). The fuse has to be shorter where the suffering is more acute.&quot;</p><p>One is reminded of the title of that movie, &quot;There will be blood.&quot; Rather than show contrition or compassion for its own victims, Wall Street is hoping to jack up its salaries and bonuses to pre-2007 levels. The men at the top are oblivious to the pain they helped cause. And so far, they've only occasionally been scolded by politicians that have mostly enabled, coddled, bankrolled, funded, rewarded, and genuflected to their power.</p><p>Wall Street's behavior may be predictable, but how can we account for the silence of so many organizations that should be out there organizing the outrage that is building? Knock, Knock, Obama supporters, bloggers, trade unionists, out of work workers and fellow Americans. Will we fight back or roll over?</p><p>Pitchforks anyone?</p>

<p>Could there possibly be a more concise yet accurate description of the failure of Obama to live up to the expectations of the Progressives who jumpstarted his campaign? Has there been a clearer depiction of the root of all of this country's problems?</p>
<p>Every major issue facing the American people can be laid at the doorstep of unchecked corporate power.</p>
<p>Obama has been compared too often to Franklin Roosevelt. As many others have pointed out, he would better serve his original constituency by acting like Theodore.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Obama no longer sees Progressives as a vital part of his support.</p>

      <p>Nicely stated. I voted for Mckinney in the last election, and for Nader in 1996, 2000, and 2004. (In other words, my consceince is clean and my soul is still intact.) All the Obama disciples where signing the same tune: "Change we can believe in" but got something else instead. What they got was Bush Light. While I agree with the beautiful Cats rattling the cages of Obama's disciples, it will not make any difference. We are marginalized for our views, cast off as a minor irritation. Meanwhile, Obama, Guiethner, and Summers march lock step by fleecing the treasury, enriching the elites, with nothing more than a minor hickup by the 'true believers' supporting Obama. When will the sheep wake up? My guess is when the superstructure comse crashing down with a Wake Up call that will be heard around the world leading to our next great revolution.</p>

      <p>How can you do the same exact thing for 12 years and then rag on Obama for not changing anything? You can't change anything standing on the outside looking in, even if you are standing on your principles. You shouldn't bother to vote at all. You're as bad as the Republicans, waiting for Obama to fail so you can get a big fat "I told you so". I'm sick of the negativity on this board, everywhere. I worry if I use the word "hope" that I'll get slammed for my naivete. I do see change and if you don't I feel sorry for you. I'm wide awake and I'm attempting to participate and I try to come up with creative ways to do it. I have made serious changes in my life. Besides bitching on CD and feeling holier than thou, WTF are YOU doing?</p>

      <p>This is frankly a ridiculous post. You could throw the same boring words against ANYONE who attacked the status quo. To call criticizing the status quo "negativity" is itself idiotic. Of course it's "negative." That's what criticizing is. People who criticized Bush were also being "negative." Did you have any problem with that kind of "negativity"?</p>
<p>You claim you see "change." Obama has helped the banksters steal our financial futures. Didn't you read the article? The difference between Obama &amp; Bush is that one is an ignorant clumsy salesman for US militarism, imperialism, &amp; plutocracy; while the other is a well-spoken &amp; polished salesman for the exact same things.</p>
<p>Here's a rule of Internet posting: ANYONE who defends Democrats by claiming that their critics are simply "bitching and feeling holier than thou" is a moron.</p>

      <p>Hi Dave,<br />
Will you join with me in a small but hopefully effective effort? If we all do it I believe it can have a great impact.</p>
<p>I have been sending Get Well cards to the president. They say: "America is sick. We need single payer health care as outlined in HR 676. Please support this bill and help America to Get Well Soon. Love, Elaine"</p>
<p>Write your own words, but keep it simple, make sure to say single payer and mention supporting HR676. With the "swine flu" in the headlines there's a spotlight on health care. </p>
<p>I imagine a White House buried in Get Well cards.</p>
<p>Please take five minutes and 42 cents, right now, and send your own message. </p>
<p>Send it to: Pres. Barack Obama, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC, 20500</p>

      <p>Hello Elaine,</p>
<p>"WTF are YOU doing?" is exactly the right question.  But I also agree with the outrage.  The capitalist criminals are still in charge, and the government is their fig leaf. An anguished cry in the night, or on Common Dreams, is more than justified.  Consider, for just one instance, the over 18,000 Americans who die every year for lack of health insurance (6 times the 9-11 toll, every year.)  Anyone who is not outraged is brain dead.</p>
<p>But beyond the outrage, very few people know what to do to change things.  People say work politically, and we should.  But we need to organize on every level:  labor unions, neighborhood organizing, anti - foreclosure and evictions, in schools - everywhere.  Political parties alone, third or second, won't do it.</p>
<p>The average American watches FIVE hours of TV a day (it says in the San Francisco Chronicle).  So not only are we not ORGANIZED, but we are LOSING OUR SOCIAL SKILLS.  </p>
<p>If we don't first have a society in which people TALK to each other, our politics are IRRELEVANT.  Hence the anguish and rage on Common Dreams.</p>
<p>Our first necessity?  In every city we need schools and seminars for organizers.  And Common Dreams should have a permanently running blog on organizing techniques, not dependent on the story of the day.<br />
Write me at Laurenceofberk@aol.com and I'll send you my latest framework for organizing.  We can't give up.</p>

      <p>rfloh, good call. I got reamed for saying that calling the White House "the Black House" and calling Obama "boy" were racist comments, but I realized that the more they protest, the more they are not admitting their racism. Perhaps as much to themselves as to the rest of us. That I don't know. In this I think Dorothy Parker was a sage.</p>

      <p>Danny, your call to action is appreciated, but where are more brave voices? How can we the people be motivated? Where is the leadership for a more just nation to come from? </p>
<p>Most certainly the bankers and the U.S. Congress have abandoned we the people, and I also feel our nation has been been abandoned by our Churches, colleges and universities. The greed of capitalism seems to rule all major institutions of America. Obama is up against the powers that be, he cannot be expected to do it alone.  </p>
<p>Danny, HOW can we the people get a national pamphlet movement going via the Internet? This has been suggested by other posters on CD. </p>
<p>I suggest We the people distribute these pamphlets on every campus, in every church,  and on every  car windshield, front door and telephone pole in America. Then maybe a real movement of public awareness and massive non-violent protest could  emerge.</p>
<p>Please Danny, get back to Common Dreams on this.  You may be the best judge of this.</p>

      <p>Stephen V. Riley, good to hear your call for action, although I'm not so sure that peaceful polite protests will impress the bankers.</p>
<p>We need to do more than that. I'm not sure how we can vote out these bought and paid for scumbags in Congress. But they need to go. </p>
<p>Ralph pointed out years ago that both political parties have been hopelessly corrupted by money. Hopelessly meaning beyond repair. And that's why he kept running. Had nothing to do with ego. Had everything to do with public service. When I decided to vote for Obama, I thought he would use the bully pulpit to inform the public how they're being conned. But I see he won't do that. I still think he would stand with the people if they do the right thing. But he won't take the lead, he's not a firebrand by nature. Meanwhile the propaganda machine has total control over what the masses get to know. So if enough of us are out there leafletting pamphlets and talking with people, maybe the word can be spread. </p>
<p>I decided to go with a simple straightforward bumper sticker. I like clever, but I think people are too uninformed for that.</p>

      <p>BFK, I like your Idea. Will you help me with mine? I posted it a little earlier on this thread to DaveBronstien May 2nd, 2009 3:01 pm.</p>
<p>I went to the Dr.'s office with my husband a while ago, and after the visit was over and we were paying our co-pay, I asked the three nurses/office workers in the room if they were in favor of single-payer national health care. Huh? They all said. What's that again? I explained about HR676, and that our own congressional Rep. Ryan was even a co-sponsor. Well, they know him and like him, so that helped. I ended up writing down the number of the bill and beseeching them to do some research and make some calls.</p>
<p>But if these gals were unaware, then no wonder we have our work cut out for us. We need a simple and easy way to inform people, and a simple and easy way to give them to act. That's why I have chosen to focus my meager energy and resources on my "Get Well America" card-sending spree.</p>
<p>You say: "I still think he [Obama] would stand with the people if they do the right thing." I agree. I think standing up for the basic human right of health care will go a long way towards changing the way we think. If we can bring ourselves to care about one another, maybe we will care more about torture, bombing, and economic ruin. </p>
<p>Will you please write a card today?</p>

      <p>The banksters are digging their own graves.  People are walking away from credit and making do with what they have.  Currently there is a full court press to convince the public that the economy is getting better, it is not.  Alternative and more sustainable lifestyles based upon economic reality are supplanting the old system.  There is no turning back.  The Obama administration is on the wrong side of economic change.  Supporting death marked banksters is fools play.</p>

      <p>"...The banksters are digging their own graves..."</p>
<p>- I disagree. The banksters are winning. With Obama's help, they are getting away with the greatest heist of all time. They are digging OUR graves, not their own.</p>
<p>The only way they won't wind up completely dominating society is if there is organized resistance, which must necessarily arise OUTSIDE the official political system. You seem to have some sort of post-hippie delusion about "alternative lifestyles" quietly &amp; peacefully taking over, based on their purity &amp; sustainability. That's a silly fantasy. It's not how the world works. There MUST be an organized fight, a sustained confrontation -- otherwise the banksters will win, because they are organized and willing to fight, and the rest of the population is not.</p>
<p>You're right that the economy is not getting better, despite the "full court press" to convince the public that it is. But you're wrong to imagine that everyone starting to grow their own vegetables, etc, is going to defeat the banksters who control the US government.</p>

<p>Yes I agree, for now  "The banksters are winning."</p>
<p>I disagree that "The only way they won't wind up completely dominating society is if there is organized resistance," as the popular expression of an enraged public is extremely unpredictable.</p>
<p>I would agree that the 1% elites have placed in advance their undeserved faith in: FEMA camps, civil rights erosion, and eliminated Posse Comitatus restraints on the military.</p>
<p>What is completely unpredictable is when the massive numbers will sway and break through the illusions and fear drenched obstructions to free expression and rage, which would necessarily include the soldiers and their own families.</p>

Tar and feathering appears inadequate, and stoning hasn't yet surfaced as an idea....The fuse has to be shorter where the suffering is more acute."</p>
<p>With the major increases in gun/ammunition purchases lately, I suspect that we will be seeing more violence in this country.  With 600,000 - 700,000 jobs being lost on a monthly basis, 'fuses are getting shorter and suffering is becoming more acute'. </p>
<p>While politicians continue to genuflect to and vindicate the Wall Street casino players who are responsible for destroying the financial system, they are essentially setting up the perfect storm for increased violence in this country.</p>
<p>Real wealth comes from actual production - not from credit default swaps!</p>

<p>Let's not forget that our political leaders have taken an "oath" to uphold our Constitution and protect &amp; defend the citizens of this country.</p>

      <p>Gail, Excellent post!</p>
<p>Does anyone wonder why so many draconian, anti-Constitutional laws have been passed? The ruling class rich are worried about civil unrest.</p>
<p>At least Dennis Kucinich was adamant about pulling out of the WTO and the NAFTA/CAFTA agreements, and, as usual, was marginalized by MSM.</p>
<p>As far as our political leaders are concerned in regards to "taking an oath" to uphold our Constitution, mouthing those words are just protocol, because none of the politicians have enforced it. High crimes, treason, and crimes against humanity by the Bush/Cheney Republican Crime Family and their Democratic Party collaborators have not only gone unpunished, but we are told by Obama and his chief of staff, Rahm Emannuel not to dwell in the past. </p>
<p>The slime in Washington D.C. saves "oaths" for those in the military with a conscience that refuse to take part in illegal activities and war crimes.</p>
<p>My compliments.</p>

      <p>When one of the world's major religions virtually excommunicates so many of its devoted followers and hangers-on, then trouble will follow. The Wall Street Pontificate (piece be upon them) seems to believe that upping the tithe is the one, true ladder to heaven. After all, if one can't afford one's own Lear Jet, then how can one truly slip the surly bonds of Earth? And surely most Americans understand that Wall Street Middle Managers (pbut) must be allowed to ream the initiate at will, for how else to truly appraise future vestmental hierarchy? Yet just as the Catholic Church over indulged several centuries back, we do move closer to a point of reckoning when gluttony and impoverished anger have their day in the streets.</p>

      <p>The banksters will have to live in the world they create. Look at how many of the filthy rich live in fear in Brazil, with kidnappings and being sent part of an ear or finger sliced off from a loved one. However, they might not even get that far here if they continue along their 'merry' hoarding way. Sooner or later these gross imbalances will have to rectified. Continued resistance will likely put them in peril as more and more people scramble to get their needs met. Perhaps large scale hunger will be the trigger, but once the dam breaks, watch out!</p>

      <p>We all thought that Jack Kevorkian was Dr. Death.  In fact, it is Obysmal, riding with the Dos Caballeros of the Apocalypse: Summers and Geithner.  When their best laid plans go awry, how does Obysmal plan to save his political ass?  Borrow more money?  Start acting like FDR?  It'll be far too late for that.  Right now, Obysmal must think he continues to lead an utterly charmed life.  He becomes president against all odds.  He kills the pirates.  Specter becomes a Democrat.  Everything he touches turns to gold.  This is when he needs to watch out.  But like any ordinary politician in our time, he will do no such thing.</p>

      <p>As he writes, "Last week, a Zogby poll found that a majority of the public believes the press made things worse by reporting on the economic collapse." THAT hasn't changed in 50 years and may be equally applied to every nasty aspect of our society from cops doing 12 volt interrogations on Black and Brown men to "race relations" to our policies on torture, the ways we used human slavery to build this country and the reasons why our subdivisions are built on mass graves and our freeways are paved with the bones of our victims both from here and from around the globe. </p>

      <p>"'Obama,' he writes 'seems depressingly reliant on the same-old, same old cast of self-serving house wreckers who act as if government exists for the sole benefit of corporations and executives.'" "As if"? Is there any shadow of a doubt here? The election of Barack Obama was one of the most effective marketing campaigns in recent history and has many lessons for activists.  The first is the longing people have to subordinate their personal interests to an extra-personal cause.  Trained by decades of subordinating our interests as workers to those of the employing class, we instinctively see their interests as our own.  Notice how closely rage tracks the health of the stock market, though most workers benefit very little from such fluctuations.</p>
<p>We see ourselves as means to ends that are determined by experts and owners.  Our neglect of our own interests is determined by the conditions of our employment.  Those who identify most closely with the interests of their company advance the fastest.  Obama and his administration know exactly who their employers are.</p>
<p>The question Schechter raises and many posters echo is how to arouse effective resistance.  Though I believe we are in a pre-revolutionary situation, I see the proliferation of calls to violence as playing directly into the hands of the financial elite.  Violence tracks their interests so closely that I suspect their minions behind much of the vitriol.  </p>
<p>As always, their purpose is increased profits and faster accumulation of capital.  The current Western democracies with their social supports and environmental protections, however anemic, have become inadequate profit vehicles.  Bank bailouts have several beneficial effects for the elite.  Beside direct access to Treasury funds, they can extend long-term domination by imposing unsupportable debts on the majority of the U.S. population, using access to credit as an irresistible means of political control.</p>
<p>We may be a long way from violent revolution, but notice how the possibility is constantly hyped in the right-wing press.  An excellent example is the coverage of the G20 summit during which the demonstrators were constantly referred to as "anarchists" and a loop of a demonstrator smashing a bank window was played over and over to the practical exclusion of any other demonstration image.</p>
<p>Gandhi showed that one who truly practices nonviolence has the world at his feet.  While hatred binds us tightly to our exploiters, nonviolence can break both their bonds and our own.  "In its positive form, ahimsa means the largest love, the greatest charity.  If I am a follower of ahimsa, I must love my enemy." - Gandhi.  This attitude must be coupled with total clarity regarding how opposed our interests are to those of the ruling elite if our tactics are to be effective.</p>

      <p>Thanks for the clarification - glad to see that the Obama illusion is fading for some.

      <p>There could be another aspect to all of the troubles that are culminating in the present dilemma, and that could be that his most powerful constituents are not only preparing to suppress a revolt but have been working for some years to get the masses to revolt. And that would make your observation, "I see the proliferation of calls to violence as playing directly into the hands of the financial elite.", a sectional stage in their master plan. Of course, that is thinking a little out of the box but the capitalists have prior schemes hidden in their stage-managed histories.</p>
<p>One example is when, in WW1, the British emptied their male prisons and sent all those men to the front and told them to stand up straight and walk forward across the field of no man's land. At a walking pace! Into pillboxes filled with machine guns which the Germans had many times proven the efficiency of. Using the very same technique of slaughter that the British themselves had used, and perfected, on many peoples in Africa, India and other places in the East.</p>
<p>The way those capitalists think, is that they have to have wars fairly regularly so that they can reduce the number of able young men in the nation who are not in their standing police army, their military or any of their security organizations. Because they always fear revolt and no more so than in the U.s. where the owners of the nation have seen the writing on the wall for some years.</p>

      <p>Violence plays into the hands of the economic power centers because it allows them to impose to military discipline on the work force.  If there was an outbreak of militant violence in the U.S., the official response would be an immediate declaration of martial law followed by a round up of dissidents. Any pretense of habeas corpus would be dropped. The violence of the rebels would be wildly exaggerated by the MSM to justify the suspension of legal rights.  Torture of American citizens would be back on the table as a means of crowd control through state terrorism.  The current media coverage of "anarchists" and "eco-terrorists" is part of the set up for these possible scenarios.  I know that some will see this as a "conspiracy theory", but it's just an extrapolation of current trends.  Take a look a Naomi Wolf's recent work to compare the current U.S. trends with Nazi Germany and other fascist takeovers.</p>
