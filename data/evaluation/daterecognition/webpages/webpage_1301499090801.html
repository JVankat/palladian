                          <p class="first">If The Honourable Madam Justice B. Brown ever retires from the bench, she should consider teaching university courses in lateral thinking. <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/Jdb-txt/SC/05/14/2005BCSC1443.htm"target="_blank">Her ruling</a> on the contempt of court charge against the BC Teachers' Federation stumped the pundits and was described in glowing terms. She essentially put the teachers' union into trusteeship while reserving the right to levy further heavy penalties. Her explicit reference to denying the $50 per day strike pay infuriated the rank-and-file teachers and might contribute to renewing their resolve to remain on the picket line several more days at the risk of enormous fines for the union.</p>
                          <p>A broad interpretation of the court's order means the union is in trusteeship with the court appointed "monitor". The union, in that interpretation, cannot use its email systems, its phone systems, its faxes or even its offices to in any way to further the strike action. Doing so would aggravate the contempt and run the risk of bankrupting the union with fines.</p>
                          <p>The <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/Jdb-txt/SC/05/14/2005BCSC1443.htm"target="_blank">court's decision</a> said:</p>
                          <p>"I will enjoin the BCTF and related entities (and here I am contemplating wholly-owned subsidiaries, trusts, etc, because I do not understand or know the exact mechanism that the BCTF is using to facilitate the breach of the court order, it appears that there may be funds solely in control of the BCTF) and from using their assets to further the breach of the court order of October 6, 2005."</p>
                          <p>The court also said:</p>
                          <p>"In particular, the BCTF is enjoined from paying amounts to its members as "strike pay" or to otherwise compensate members for loss relating to breach of the order of October 6, 2005; from providing guarantees or promises to pay to protect members from such losses; from using its books records and offices to permit third parties to facilitate continuing breach of the court order."</p>

                          <p><b>Not about 50 bucks</b></p>
                          <p>It took a lot to drive law abiding teachers to participate in the longest province-wide strike in BC's history. Large classes with unlimited numbers of special needs students is a daily reality that is not the same for trustees, administrators or parent advisory groups as it is for classroom teachers. Anger over those learning and working conditions, resulting from the Campbell government's 2002 Bill 28, drove the "illegal strike". Many teachers were insulted with the suggestion that they have been on picket lines because of the incentive of $50 a day in strike pay.</p>
                          <p>The behaviour of the Campbell government during the dispute has been despicable. The Premier spoke live from Toronto on Global TV shortly after the court decision was announced. When asked what he would say to teachers he spoke in the third person about what "they" might think or do. He missed the opportunity to look them in the eye and ask for a fresh start.</p>
                          <p>That's no surprise since his Minister of Labour took the lead in teacher bashing the first week of the strike; instead of acting as a neutral party in an attempt to find a solution. When the media found a dozen or so teachers, out of 40,000, who crossed the picket line, Education Minister Shirley Bond crept out of her hiding place and proclaimed that the government would stand behind teachers who stood up to their union.</p>
                          <p>Unions have an obligation under their constitution and by-laws to deal with complaints by one member against another, but it is highly unlikely that any union would punish a member for crossing the line under the circumstances facing the BCTF. However, it is also unlikely that any such member would find themselves anything but ostracized by their colleagues; the staff room is likely to be a very cold place for some teachers.</p>
                          <p><b>Face-saving measure needed</b></p>
                          <p>The dispute between BC's teachers and the Campbell government has not been helped by the court's decision or by the behaviour of the Premier, the Minister of Labour or the Minster of Education. However it ends, the bitterness is likely to continue for a long time to come, much to the detriment of everyone involved.</p>
                          <p>A key to exercising power is to know its limitations. The extremely arrogant Campbell government has repeatedly demonstrated that it doesn't understand its limitations. At a time when the courts are on the verge of bankrupting the union that has already been placed into virtual trusteeship, the Campbell government could defuse the conflict for the sake of education by offering some small compromise. A government that knows how to exercise power would create a "face saving" alternative for both parties.</p>

<p>Wow, another article that picks up on Chinese culture that is driving economics in BC's newly minted Golden Triangle Decade.</p>

<p>In Killian's article he used the Chinese saw "kill a chicken to scare a monkey," and now in this article "face saving." But I think we have gotten to the "Wang loses his horse" stage.</p>

<p>That is, an old folk story is well studied in Chinese Communist Party dialectics. The story "sai wang shi ma" (Wang loses his horse) tells of a farmer who loses his horse, but then it returns with another horse which is 10,000 times stronger than the original horse. Wang is not impressed though since he muses that when something good happens it is followed by something bad; and when something bad happens something good will follow. And sure enough when his son tries to ride the new horse he breaks his leg. But whatever, since when the military comes around to force him into the army, he cannot due to his broken leg.</p>

<p>In the Chinese Communist Party though this story is used to illuminate how revolutionary processes in history are just as cyclical as turns of good and bad luck in Wang's life. With a general strike in BC it seems we could be fulfilling that theory.</p>

<p>Scheck amplifies the only one side if disagreement without focussing on the reality of the confronted issues or indeed presenting any solutions. </p>

<p>The clear fact is that there are highlighted issues that have festered and have not been resolved. </p>

<p>Without question the current negotiation system is broken, but at the same time, year over year, the government has substantially increased the budget for education. We have more money in the provincial budget than we ever have had.</p>

<p>The BCTF is not the sole owner of education delivery and never should be. What we nned to do is set a level playing field very quickly by review by all the education stake holders. This exercise must be inclusive, not narrow. </p>

<p>The Court ruling is interesting but also provides all parties a sense of pause. Schreck is dead wrong in his assessment. While the freezing of the BCTF assets is interesting such is by no means debilitating. </p>

<p>What all parties need to do is to get back to work and deal with the issues identified.</p>

<p>Why do we have teachers complaining that text books are not available when clearly budgets are identified for such?</p>

<p>Why do we not have desks when budgets are identified.</p>

<p>Why and so on!</p>

<p>We can only resolve these issues through effective baseline assessments and address outstanding problems head on. </p>

<p>However, in now way should any organized labout entity have sole right in this issue. The education of our kids is way too important and must be neutral. </p>

<p>What we need is to quickly resolve these issues through careful inclusive analysis and adopt table solutions. </p>

<p>Obviously the NDP inspired collective negotiation system does not work and must be abolished. So should the BCPSEA and the College of Teachers. Likely the whole School District system needs a review as well. </p>

<p>I think the Court struck a brillant balance and the next move must be initated by all parties.</p>

<p>Continued opposition will not gain anything!</p>

<p>The roots of this struggle go back many years, as successive governments, both left and right have cut funding to the education system.</p>

<p>In Vancouver, we lost first, administrative positions at the school board.  People in these positions were responsible for subject areas.  They instituted and facilitated professional development and acted as advocates and contacts for their subject areas.</p>

<p>When this wasn't enough, we lost our Techers Centre, the heart of our professional development program.  The scope of professional development was reduced. The loss of the Centre was accompanied by the loss of the Teacher' Professional Library, a centre for borrowing curriculum materials and professional books and journals.</p>

<p>As this was happening, the budget for school libraries was being cut back dramatically.</p>

<p>Vice principal time was cut back, so that some schools lost their VP.  Others had so little time, they might as well not have been there.</p>

<p>Finally came increased class sizes, loss of teacher-libraian time(In Victoria, elementary school librarians were eliminated entirely) and loss of support for special needs students.</p>

<p>Another root cause of the current situation is the interference by both the NDP and Liberal governments.</p>

<p>In 1994, the NDP government, did away with local bargaining for anything that would cost money,leaving local school boards with mostly housekeeping items to negotiate.</p>

<p>The government then tried to negotiate a new provincial contract.  In doing so, however, they tried to do away with much of the contract language that union locals had negotiated over the years, often giving way on salary items to gain better learning conditions for students and better working conditions for themselves.</p>

<p>The NDP government did not want to take the best contract language from all the contracts around the province and put it together in a provincial contract.  They wanted to take the lowest common denominator, or a middle ground.</p>

<p>While this would be good for local who had not been able to negotiate good contracts, it penalized those locals who had, and who had in the process given up some salary increases for better learning and working conditions.</p>

<p>The BCTF's position was that it would not negotiate a provincial contract that gave poorer contract language than locals already had.  Since the provincial government would not agree, contract talks stalled and the existing local contracts were carried over.</p>

<p>The above is why Campbell's Liberals say that contracts have no been successfully negotiated for the last 10 or 11 years.</p>

<p>During Campbell's first term in office, he scrapped the contracts that had been negotiatated in good faith over decades.  </p>

<p>Past governments, both left and right have trampled on the right of workers to free collective bargaining.<br />

<p>IMHO, Justice Brown took the least punitive course open to her. Whether or not we agree the ruling was fair - and I don't - still, <span style="text-decoration:underline">her</span> role is to interpret and uphold the law, not to pass judgement upon its worthiness. </p>

<p>Yes, the teachers are breaking the law. But it is an unjust law, to be sure. Thus, they are correct in practicing Civil Disobedience in protest and in demanding the law be changed. </p>

<p>We are now in the public arena phase of that protest, and if we all stand with the BCTF, Campbell is hooped, regardless of how many legal straws he may try to reach for.</p>

                                <h3>sdgreen, I read your other post which answered my question</h3>
<p>sdgreen, I read your other post which answered my question about how you would improve the current education system.  Surprise!!  I agreed more of it than you would probably think.  I thank you for not laying the blame on the teachers.  What a refreshing change!!    Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to respond to it as I would like since I've been kind of busy trying to help teachers understand the ramifications all these recent events (although I did have time to write a very long and emotional post elsewhere).</p>

<p>But, in regards to your post above, I have never believed that the BCTF has ever thought teachers (because we are the BCTF, after all) solely owned the right to make decisions about our public education system.  I do, however, believe that if teachers (through the BCTF) do not address the crisis in education, who will?  I try very hard to keep informed on these matters but I've never seen so many suggestions on how to help improve the current system than I have in the past few days.  This all might have been avoided if BCPSEA (aka the government) had just made an attempt at negotiations at even one of those 35 bargaining meetings, don't you think?</p>

<p>I would suspect that, with all your ideas for improvement, we will see your name as one of the participants of Ms. Bond's proposed roundtable?  If so, if the Liberal government promises to implement some of your suggestions will you be able to trust them to follow through?  Or will you look at their past record (i.e. BC Rail, etc.) and have problems believing their promises?</p>

<p>I know of a teacher who told me this incredible story about an administrator and text books. The teacher was using an excellent math text book for his math class. He went to his principle for funds to rebind these texts for further future use. The administrative officer said no and he then at the end of the school year collected these same text books and sent them to be destroyed. This same principle then (with the advise of his teachers not to)proceeded to buy a class set of math texts books at a cost of three thousand dollars that were both teacher unfriendly and studednt unfriendly. The teacher decided to use his own materials to teach math and these same text books that were purchased to this day remain on the shelf unused.</p>

<p>It's obvious to me that this judge is covering her ass to protect her judicial reputation when this draconian ruling is reversed on appeal. As in the middle ages when witch-hunters plucked an individual from society to be ostracised and shunned and eventually destroyed; such is the intended fate of the teachers union. <br />
Isolate, then destroy.  With these tactics the judicial system's reputation will continue to degrade in Canadian society.</p>

<p>You know I can tolerate the no strike pay of this order because the teachers are saying that their disobedience goes beyond the usual employee/employer disagreements. They are adamant in saying their actions are against the legeslative hammer that is being used to force them to work in a system they believe is detremental to students with both short and long term implications(ie classroom safety and getting a fully "functional" education). Where I have problems with Justice Brown's rulings is in the no advertisements allowing the teachers' equal footing to get their message to the people of this province and with the no cummunications between the BCTF executive and membership about said issues. How is the BCTF to get instruction from the people who they are working for? Aren't the teachers allowed the same freedoms of speech/association that other unions, associations, clubs, individuals even corporations? Is this not "muzzling" gov't critics? Also I find the no third party help rule a bit too vague in a number of ways. Having said this I still applaud the Justice's attempts while stuck in a mess that to me, the courts shouldn't be put into, especially with the frequency that is happening with this gov't.</p>

<p>regarding the court ruling yesterday.  i heard about it as i participated in the afternoon shift of picketing at my school (where, by the way, many many cars were honking and waving support - thanks so much for that!).  we were all puzzled, as so many people were assuming (this was the bill good show) that we would immediately go back to work because we don't get our $50.00 strike pay.  does anyone actually think that we are standing in the rain and not in our classrooms doing what we love so we can collect $50.00 a day?  sorry, but that is not what this is about and it just made everyone on my picket line even more determined to stay out there.  so please, if you have time today, drive by your local school and thank those teachers standing out there in the cold for standing up for what they believe in - public education that is for everyone. gotta go now and drop off a tarp for the morning shift!</p>

<p>One of B.C.'s dailies goes back to the time of the Solidarity movement and quotes the media-darling of the day, Jack Munro, on how a general strike could not have been handled.</p>

<p>It's doubtful that the province was ever better-positioned for such an action but workers were sold out by a blustering loudmouth who was found wanting at a time of desperate need.</p>

<p>Perhaps a general strike is the only answer to challenge a government that places little value on education as it hammers workers with its puppet courts.</p>

<p>There is naught to do today, teachers and supporters, but have some fun with the bind we find ourselves in regarding communications. Towards that end, some of us are taking on "secret agent" names and wearing trench coats to the lines today. (I myself will be "Bondage" in deference to our Minister of Ed.) Between the very real stresses of this Orwellian pickle, we amuse ourselves with images of Jinny Simms being whisked around in disguise, passed from interceptor to interceptor, and making calls from a pay phone.... Not a funny situatiion I realize, but laughter keeps us going.</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">"The roots of this struggle go back many years, as successive governments, both left and right have cut funding to the education system." wrote Daryl of dsturdy.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>Overall, a very interesting piece, Daryl, with which I much agree.</p>

<p>Now, historically, there was and marginally remains a degree to which the NDP can be described as "left", I suppose. Certainly about as much as one can characterize Tony Blair's Labour as "left".</p>

<p>These things are typically <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> relative, of course, to whom or what we are comparing them.</p>

<p>But <span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-style:italic">by and large</span></span>, it's been a long time past, other than in the sentiments of our historical memory, I think, that we could characterize the NDP as "left" with any great degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>Certainly, again in my view, it would be more accurate to have said in your quoted piece, "The roots of this struggle go back many years, as successive governments, both <span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-style:italic">right</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-style:italic">righter</span></span> have cut funding to the education system."</p>

<p>And I say this because, though there is some difference in the philosophical minutia of the major "parties of capitalism", they are all fundamentally agreed upon the <span style="font-style:italic">system</span> of ruling class economic rule itself, and upon the need for a legal framework to control <span style="font-style:italic">labour</span>. The NDP no less than the Neoconazi Lib/Cons/Socred Grand Alliance.</p>

<p>Mostly, the difference is that typically, the NDP will administer their <span style="font-style:italic">medicine</span> with a little sugar or honey, to ease it going down. Whereas the Neoconazis don't give a schmuck how bitter you find the pill.</p>

<p>At the end of the day however, the "result" from both sides lead in the same direction, and serve the economic ruling class. For both equally fear their disapproval and withdrawl of cooperation-, though it is more typically directed at the NDP, for being "perceived" the wimpier and most sympathetic to the working class.</p>

<p>And I am not saying that it is unnecessary to play the game of the lesser of evils. <span style="font-style:italic">Sometimes</span> there is no other practical choice.</p>

<p>But there really is a need for us all to face up to what is really happening here, in all its relative complexity-, for it is the mud, the blood and the beer in which we are mired.</p>

<p>Other than that, I generally agreed with your comment above.</p>

<p>Now, I'm away for the day, including to a support demo for teachers later this afternoon.</p>

<p>Victory to the teachers, and to us all.</p>

<p>What really amazes me in this whole issue is that the government still has it's collective head up its ass.<br />
First the BCSPEA WON"T BARGAIN<br />
Then the teachers commence small job action to try and wake them up.<br />
Then the Labour Board makes a ruling and before you can take a full breath the government passes a bogus law while still refusing to bargain.(collusion?)<br />
So the teachers have no recourse but to shut down, by whatever means necessary.<br />
All the while the labour minister (another joke just as he was with the lumber dispute) is saying you should obey the law and go back to work. Excuse me?<br />
Then this bogus bargaining unit goes to court to get an illegal strike ruling (when in fact it is a walkout)They get the ruling and Mikey says you should do the right thing and go back to work.<br />
Then in the penalty phase the judge orders assets frozen (which is so far from what the government wants its actually funny)while admitting in the order that she is not familiar with the workings of what is going on. My hat is off to the judge because she had to respond to the law however bogus it was. Ms Sims says they are still ready tobargain at any time. And what does Mikey do? Instead of immediately having the parties back to the table he says "we will go back to the table the day that the teachers return to work" Now I don't know what the rest of you think but the ball is in the ministers of education and labours' court. They are the ones who precipated this whole thing by refusing to bargain in good faith and used their offices to pass this bogus law.And by their previous actions (lies)they are not to be trusted unless they make the first move.<br />
So now mister minister take a walk outside your mind and do the right thing and while you are at it REPEAL this idiot law. <br />
And Gordo I suggest you get back here in a hurry and fix this thing we all know you started. I do not advocate General Strikes unles they are needed for extreme measures and up till this point I haven't. But if you do not get these people back to the table by monday morning I will be contacting everyone I know in the labour movement to advocate one. And not just a one daay stoppage either.</p>

<p>How can British Columbia tolerate such retrograde  injustice against 38,000 of our most honoured professionals? Are we going to tolerate this in a just society?</p>

<p>Teachers not allowed to speak to the public? Teachers not allowed to discuss their concerns with colleagues? Is it the B.C.T.F. or education itself, I wonder, which is such a threat to the Gordon Campbell Empire? </p>

                                <h3>here's a thought to consider. my wife works in student</h3>
<p>here's a thought to consider. my wife works in student support services as a speech therapist. for those who do not know, it takes a Masters degree to practice speech therapy in BC. depending on the year, her caseload might be forty kids, or it might be 130. it's an itinerant position, where therapists have to use their own vehicles to drive from one school to the next, which can often be twenty minutes or so apart. when i asked her if there are limits on how many kids she sees, she said 'of course not. you just deal with it.' she says that many teachers LOVE to see the speech therapist coming because it means that for an hour or so they have a 'problem child' taken out of their classroom.<br />
now, i ask you - would the teachers EVER go on strike to support ten or so lowly speech therapists and their workload? of course, some here will argue that the therapists need a stronger union, blah-blah, but virtually all of the professionals i know (lawyers, accountants, doctors, etc) put in HUGE hours of work. this isn't a pissing contest of who works the hardest. </p>

<p>Another thought â€“ would teachers still be bitching if their class size was cut in half â€“ not initially, they wouldnâ€™t, but in ten yearsâ€™ time the same disaffected, mad at the system types who dominate unions (and Iâ€™ve been a member of three of â€˜em) rise to the top and preach the kind of overthrow the system militant crap that we hear on these boards? life is too short to be mad at the system, 24/7. Iâ€™m sure most teachers would love the luxury of time that most Tyee posters seem to have.</p>

<p>a solidarity rally, when union membership is at a historic low and 95 percent of all British Columbians have never even heard of Solidarity? in your dreams. this strike continues for another week and Gordo's popularity will skyrocket. many parents have had enough.</p>

<p>and people wonder why gordo raised the spectre of a teacher's strike in the last weekend of the election... </p>

<p>This is a hugely critical weekend for the teachers. Support has peaked, the silence from the BC Fed and the NDP is deafening, (yep, just like Jack 'i like my spotted owls deep-fried' Munro - now THERE was the sellout!), and public patience will be pretty much exhausted. take the high road, here, make the first move to conciliation, and you'll win public support. protract the strike, a la TELUS, CBC, the NHL, etc, and you'll open the door to massive privatization.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"the Campbell government could defuse the conflict for the sake of education by offering some small compromise."</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, based on their track record, not to mention their recent actions and rhetoric, it is extremely difficult for any reasonable to assume that they have any desire to defuse anything. In fact, it is much easier to assume that they want to light a fuse and blow up every act of collective bargaining they can set their legislative gunsights on. </p>

<p>Some might even call such a thing, if it were true, a secret and duplicitous plan.</p>

<p>Ron, now I know you are selectively reading these posts. You pick out only that part which you think can inflame others. But you see, I know that you are completely ignorant of the facts. You are also ignorant of the labour movement. You don't understand the difference between Strike, Lockout, and Job Action Civil Disobedience. I am further convinced by your ignorance that you are another Gordon Campbell Lackie.<br />
If you understood what is going on here, and THE REAL consequences of a general strike you would not make such bold, ignorant statements to try and inflame me.<br />
The only reason I am replying to your ignorance is to try to give you a finite measure of education. You have shown that your mind is so insulted that you actually beleive yourself. I guess your teachers in school couldn't get through to you just like the ones here are unable to. Ah well Ron, maybe someday.......</p>

<p>sthrendyle: you are astonishing. For gosh sakes, speech therapists are part and parcel of what the B.C.T.F. wants to talk about ... but the Campbell government will not, so far, do that.</p>

<p>The coldness with which you refer to those special needs kids as problem kids, is something you should think about. And why wouldnt teachers LOVE to see the speech therapists coming to assist a special needs student? You scare me.  </p>

<p>Governments don't micro-manage most professions.  Even where they're directly involved they listen to the people working in those professions.  I know in the army the politicians didn't decide how many recruits could be under the direct command of a lieutenant or captain.  Politicians didn't decide how many hours of training there would be in a day etc.  They let the army professionals make all those decisions.</p>

<p>Glad to hear your wife is able to be as good a speech therapist for 130 kids as she is for 40.  I guess she magically creates extra hours in a day so that her time with each doesn't suffer when she's assigned more students.</p>

<p>The ruling seems to me (a non-lawyer) to be a legal quagmire. Clearly it's acceptable to rule against flagrantly flouting a law. On the other hand, the Charter expressly grants (acknowledges) the following fundamental freedoms: </p>

<p>"Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:</p>

<p>    a) freedom of conscience and religion; <br />
    b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication; <br />
    c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and <br />
    d) freedom of association.  "</p>

<p>I don't understand how the ruling can legally abrogate those freedoms (FUNDAMENTAL, remember). The teachers' actions are acts of conscience based on individual belief and opinion. The picket lines have been models of peaceful assembly and association. The ruling to deny the BCTF (the elected body representing teachers) the right to communicate with their membership appears, at least on the surface, to contravene Charter Rights, which trump all other laws. </p>

<p>I am not a legal scholar, and I acknowledge the need to obey laws; however, a person of conscience has a fundamental freedom - indeed, in a democracy, a duty - to express her or his disagreement with those laws. Not the least aspect of this case is that the laws were retrofitted to match the ideological goals of the government.</p>

<p>A general strike is the only answer, in my opinion, because this gov't won't stop unless the people who own it start suffering via loss of income because their employees are out. Very sad state we are in, but that is what happens when you act like a thug instead of a public servant.</p>

<p>I've always honoured picket lines, but when I was last put on strike by my union, I thought the $50 per day was damn important.  This has got to be incredibly hard on the rank and file.  So hopefully, if the union keeps them out, they have a game plan to win.  </p>

<p>A poster above thinks that a higher court will reverse this ruling on appeal.  <span style="font-style:italic">Is</span> there an appeal in progress?</p>

<p>If there isn't a legal way to reverse the government's machinations, they have to rely on popular support to make the government move off its "legally correct" position.  I assume that the union is doing intensive polling right now to see if their methods are tactically sound, as opposed to ideologically pure.</p>

<p>It may be that the numbers will show that the union should take the deal now, for the sake of its members if nothing else.  </p>

<p>That doesn't mean the union should give up.  If the union takes this crappy deal, they could still spend the next two years -- the length of the imposed contract -- to effectively sell its agenda to the public.  Find a way to make yourselves a popular cause, fix or spin the rightwingers' criticisms, and thus become a major election issue where both sides have to support you.</p>

<p>Justice Brown can only do what the law allows her to do. What we need to do is understand why the Campbell Liberals are so interested in driving a union to do what the BCTF is doing. Teachers are generally a very conservative, law abiding bunch, yet here we have 40,000 of them defying the law. It took a lot of goading to get to this point. Why did the government allow -even encourage through chronic underfunding and bad faith bargaining- this to happen? The only reason I can see is that this government is not interested in fixing the education system; instead they want it to break down. When most parents become disillusioned with the public education system, private schooling will become the norm and the Province can cut its education budget by almost one half. Looks great on paper. Unfortunately, the logical extension of this policy is the ghettoization of public schools. Since private schools wonâ€™t take the disabled or poor, those students will all go to the public schools. Then weâ€™ll have a two-tiered education system benefitting the well-off. Pleasant for the rich, peasant for everyone else. </p>

<p>However, public education is one of the most basic foundations of a democratic society. Public education was instituted because it benefits EVERYBODY! Itâ€™s the best way to prevent tyranny, improve standard of living and keep folks healthy. The single most effective way to reduce a populationâ€™s infant mortality and extend lifespan is not to buy them drugs or provide them with doctors but to TEACH THEM TO READ. </p>

<p>Is it possible that, with all our focus on money and acquiring stuff, we have forgotten the original purpose of public education? I could see the Campbell Liberals being sneaky enough to hide this agenda, but do you think most British Columbians actually want the public edcuation system to fail?</p>

                                <h3>The New York Times' Tom ("The World is Flat") Friedman</h3>
<p>The New York Times' Tom ("The World is Flat") Friedman today reports on findings commissioned by two U.S. senators, Lamar Alexander and Jeff Bingaman, from the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. The topic is collapsing U.S. economc competitiveness; the recommendations â€” surprise â€” focus on the failure of the education system.</p>

<p>There's more to Friedman's summary than what I include but following are some indicators "that illustrate why decisive action is needed now": </p>

<p>Â· For the cost of one chemist or one engineer in the United States, a company can hire about five chemists in China or 11 engineers in India.</p>

<p>Â· Last year chemical companies shuttered 70 facilities in the United States and have tagged 40 more for closure. Of 120 chemical plants being built around the world with price tags of $1 billion or more, one is in the United States and 50 are in China.</p>

<p>Â· U.S. 12th-graders recently performed below the international average for 21 countries on a test of general knowledge in mathematics and science. In addition, an advanced mathematics assessment was administered to students in 15 other countries who were taking or had taken advanced math courses, and to U.S. students who were taking or had taken pre-calculus, calculus, or Advanced Placement calculus. Eleven countries outperformed the United States, and four scored similarly. None scored significantly below the United States. </p>

<p>Â· In 2001 U.S. industry spent more on tort litigation than on research and development. </p>

<p>Yes, this is a U.S. report but let's assume that after decades of lockstep government in Canada we could find similar results here. Connect the dots: Katrina revealed that the American infrastructure is collapsing from neglect. And reports such as this one show the same for its intellectual infrastructure. Is this any way to build an "information economy"?</p>

<p>On another day I'd argue that public education's higher purpose should be training for citizenship, not for work or profit-taking. But in B.C., where Liberal education policy can be summed up as "bust the BCTF by any means necessary," we are not serving the higher purpose, and we are even failing the low goal of producing a competent workforce.</p>

<p>It is a good sign that B.C. parents (I am one) support their teachers. It is a bad sign â€” of how institutionalized the reductionist theory of education has become â€” that teachers are in the terrible legal situation they are in today.</p>

<p>But, it will not be effective, because it is so obviously unjust that it won't escape the public and because in spite of the Liberal BS, the union IS the teachers. Thus they can organize through word of mouth, do anything a union does without using the dues. </p>

<span style="font-style:italic">"The ruling seems to me to be a legal quagmire."</span></p>

<p>To me, there is nothing strange about this decision. It seems like a fair and reasonable compromise. </p>

<p>The court did <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> apply any punitive punishment that might cause long-term harm to the union, nor did it imprison or fine <span style="font-style:italic">anyone</span>. Instead, the union was simply forced to 'cease support' for an action the current laws deem 'illegal'. </p>

<p>If you call the police about a neighbor playing loud music in the middle of the night, you don't expect them to just be handed a ticket and allowed to continue - you expect it to be 'stopped'. This is essentially what was done, with a 'warning' to not start doing it again. Pretty reasonabe to me.</p>

<p>The end result is that the judge effectively 'stopped' the union from financially or logistically supporting any further legal breach, yet it did not go so far as preventing the teachers themselves from continuing their strike. The only difference is that the union can no longer <span style="font-style:italic">urge or pay them</span> to do what the court has deemed illegal.</p>

<p>To my understanding, it was NOT on the table for this judge to <span style="font-style:italic">strike down</span> the law used to launch this prosecution - this was not a legal challenge. The judges only role was to apply the existing law and specify a reasonable remedy given the circumstances. I think the judge came up with a logical and wholely defensible ruling given the situation.</p>

<p>If the union and its supporters wants to challenge the legitimacy of the law itself, then they should do so. But unless and until they do defeat it, our judges must apply it - this is their job. In this case, I think it was a reasonable choice among the available options -- regardless of one's level of support for the teachers, because that is a <span style="text-decoration:underline">different issue</span>.</p>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, but the understanding I've been given is that the powers of a judge are pretty wide-ranging in contempt of court situations... and un-appealable. The judge has instituted a penalty particular to this situation, rather than enforcing a law, and is not bound by a precedent, which doesn't really exist as far as I know for this kind of thing.</p>

<p>PREPARE THE GENERAL STRIKE.<br />
This government has but one agenda - to break the back of public sector unions and trample the democratic rights of working people.</p>

<p>The only thing this bunch of miscreants understands is the use of raw power. So, we will give them a taste of raw power.</p>

<p>An escalating strike strategy should be implemented, with a set of clear demands. If these demands are not met by established deadlines, then waves of unionized workers should down tools until the entire province is shut down - including ferries and transportation services.</p>

<p>This government has a complete disregard for the rights of working people, and deserve only our contempt. If this had been done in 2002, we wouldn't have seen the ripping up of legal collective agreements, the massive privatization of our health care industry, and the arbitrary roll-back of workers' wages.</p>

<p>When the unionized workers at the legislature walk out, and the government is unable to conduct it's business or travel freely around the province, we will finally see results.</p>

<p>SHUT 'ER DOWN!</p>

<p>The B.C. Liberals are now facing their litmus test. Will they show that they can actually govern a Province, or will they stick to their ideological agenda at all cost, and risk more civil unrest? It appears unfortunately they may be taking the latter route, which would of course fail in the end. Running a society is not about being right or wrong, or just making and enforcing laws, it is really about properly administering public assets and services, and helping create a liveable social environment. It seems that on all those fronts the Liberals continue to display abject incomppetence. Let us hope that they haven't done too much damage by the time this, their last temr is up.</p>

<p>Here, here!  remember has an excellent argument above.  </p>

<p>The fundamental disconnect that exists in the philosophical underpinnings of all this abuse of every single principle of good governance by the Liberals seems to be their inability to understand the difference between authority and power.</p>

<p>They believe they are in 'Power', not in service.  They believe they should have the 'power' to enact laws at their own will. To make laws stripping citizens of their basic Democratic rights and freedoms, if they want.</p>

<p>This has never been true in any real Democracy, only in dictatorships.  Democracies are all about rule of law, and law itself is subject to rules and principles, or should be.</p>

<p>Liberals just do not get this distinction. They do not serve, except those more powerful. They are perplexed by the howls of their victims, when they strip away the fundamental rights and freedoms they thought would be safe.  Or the howls of the taxpayers who paid for the assets that are now sold cheap to those who offered 'contributions' to the Liberal cause.</p>

<p>If the government in 'power' can enact any laws it wants, how about a law that poor people can't vote?  I've heard it proposed.  Or maybe one requiring the homeless to wear armbands, or forbidding them to sit down?  Or outlawing labour unions and jailing activists?  Or jailing suspected socialists? Or disappearing all who disagree?</p>

<p>These things are not a great leap from where we are now.  They have all been done, or proposed, and they all stem from the idea that government does not serve, or even regulate, but instead exercizes 'Power'.</p>

<p>Taking the 'high road' is not by acting illegally. That is lowering yourself into the gutter. Don't the techers have more brains than that?</p>

<p>RRG</p>

<p>That decision was light, yet a shot over the bow to the BCTF. Nothing has been permanently taken away, and the judge decided that she won't turn ROSA into a martyr. Kind of a neat ruling, and it leaves the door wide open to real punitive fines, IF the BCTF doesn't get some education, real quick.</p>

<p>A General Strike is just so passe. It will prove nothing, other than the usual suspects, the rabble rousers are denying themselves their paychecks, doing some more self-vicitimization. it's time that the corporate unionists realized that this strategy is flawed, and only injures themselves. The modern, high tech economy still allows financial transactions to occur freely, unlike the past where a GS would have real impact. That and the fact that real enrollment in unions is declining and has been for years, and shall continue to do so. </p>

<p>The problem here is that while unions will always exist, I don't buy any of that rhetoric crap that the extremists on both sides spew, they, or their leadership have lost touch with reality, and are more into grandiose spectacles, rather than getting ot the down to earth members, who, frequently, disagree with union policy, yet are treated themselves as demagogues.</p>

<p>And that's union democracy. As long as you agree in lockstep with the groupthink.</p>

<p>Meribeth, some of Campbell's Chinese investors don't care about the right of freedom of association. That is why I think it is better to look at what is happening from a Chinese businessman's perspective. In fact, in Taiwan it wasn't until 1989 that it was granted, so some have hardly even lived to experience how this value is translated in everyday life. For example, due to this law there were no legal dance clubs in Taiwan prior to 1989. And well even after 1989, only a handful of legal clubs were established since the culture was to run things illegally anyways. Just changing a law won't necessarily lead to changes in business culture, and so the value of freedom of association really has not sunk in.</p>

<p>It should be no surprise to those of Chinese heritage that BC's so-called Golden Decade will be paid with the price of challenging Western liberal values in favour of tyrannical manipulation. Are all the Liberal MLAs content with that? I think the Liberal Party could split over selling out to Li Ka Shing and his business network. </p>

<p>And isn't that just what happened to the Socreds under Bill Van der Zalm? He made a real estate deal with a Chinese investor for an offer he could not refuse.</p>

<p>I wonder, did you say the same thing during the dictatorship of the 90's? It was after all, like that, just switch Liberal for NDP and the same thing applies.</p>

<p>Face it, we had an election earlier this year, The NDP lost despite the best efforts of the extremists, and this is an elected government. Just the same as those supporting this government had to put up with an inept government of the 90's, that certainly mistreated those not 'on their side', then you must put up with this. </p>

<p>Why is it that the extreme left always purports lawless behaviour when they don't get their way, while the 'right' is always poised and reserved in their opposition?</p>

<p>As for your last two paragraphs, it's just plain rubbish, and something you should publish in The Worker, or some other useless rag</p>

<p>Straight from Bill Good eh?  I heard him say the same thing an hour ago.  Well, many of us don't look to Bill Good to tell us what to think.</p>

<p>A general strike will not just hurt the people involved, it will hurt the economy as a whole.  Ferries will not run, schools will not run, the mail won't move, government services won't be there etc.  It will affect almost everyone and will bring pressure to bear on the gov't to bring it to an end.  They can't do that by simply telling everyone to get back to work or the courts will send the police to escort teachers to school.</p>

<p>The gov't has refused to negotiate.  Now they say they will only if the teachers return to work.  But they refuse to be bound by those negotiations so their word is meaningless.</p>

<p>"And that's union democracy. As long as you agree in lockstep with the groupthink."</p>

<p>Funny, sounds more like Campbell democracy to me.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"there is no bargaining table to go back to. Unless you mean the one that will bargain issues other than pay and working conditions."</span></p>

<p>Many seem to have forgotten that teacher salaries and other education funding started falling behind under <span style="text-decoration:underline">the NDP government</span>. Therefore every exaggerated claim being made here against the Liberals could also be made against the NDP. Why do you think they are so quiet on the issue?</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you agree with their choices, it is worth <span style="font-style:italic">understanding</span> WHY the Liberals are standing firm on this issue. The teachers are not the only public union looking for pay raises. The Liberals set a policy that 'froze' wages <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">until next year</span></span>.</p>

<p>Public unions that have already accepted freezes would be pissed that their members' needs were seen as <span style="font-style:italic">less important</span> than teachers. If unions still negotiating see that all it takes is a strike to get the government to back down from their policy, then what do you think those unions will do? If you say nothing, then you haven't been living in BC very long!</p>

<p>The government has already made clear that the teachers and other public servants CAN EXPECT a raise in their 'next' contract - after the freeze expires. Therefore claims that there is no reason to negotiate are uninformed - this <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> an available 'option'. I understand if teachers <span style="font-style:italic">reject</span> this, but it is an option none the less.</p>

<p>As for the class size issue, I am not convinced it should be discussed as a 'condition' of a collective agreement. To me it smacks of political maneuvering when the <span style="font-style:italic">real issue</span> is a 15% raise - let's be honest about that.</p>

<p>I feel that the teachers would gain considerably more legitimacy for their views on class size if they made it a <span style="font-style:italic">political campaign</span> AFTER they were back in schools. This is how you lobby for changes in government policy IMHO.</p>

<p>It is not the teachers' role to 'demand' that the government run schools to suit them. They can and <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> be a loud voice speaking out when they feel strongly about the system, but unless they can prove unreasonable 'personal hardship', then I do not accept it as a valid reason to strike.</p>

<p>So let us be clear that this strike is primarily about MONEY, not class size. Teachers <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> legitimately concerned about class-size, but not for a moment do I believe this issue would prevent them from accepting a contract that gave them the pay raise they want. Their priorities are clear.</p>

<p>So while I fully agree that teachers are underpaid, I am unmoved by rhetoric that they are on strike for 'the good of students'. This is politics. It may be part of the negotiating game, but I will not fall for it any more than I accept all the government's rhetoric.</p>

<p>If this where really true, how do you reconcile the fact that the only reason women are allowed to vote today is the result of civil disobedience. The only reason that gays now have rights is a direct result of civil disobedience.</p>

<p>Are you saying that politicians that pass laws have absolute power regardless of how flawed these laws are. And you support democracy? I think not - that, sir descibes what I see as a fascist dictatorship using the courts to impose rulings that are directly in conflict with our consitutional rights to freedom of speech.</p>

<p>"Many seem to have forgotten that teacher salaries and other education funding started falling behind under the NDP government"</p>

<p>But the fact is that the NDP did listen to teacher recommendations on class sizes, librarians, special needs etc and acted accordingly.  The teachers had to forego a pay raise to get those things but they themselves decided it was worth it.  The Liberals took that away.</p>

<p>"Why do you think they are so quiet on the issue?"</p>

<p>Because then it would become a Liberal vs NDP issue and the NDP doesn't want that to happen.  </p>

<p>"The Liberals set a policy that 'froze' wages until next year."</p>

<p>Yet the Liberals knew the teacher contract would be up well before that.  Even if you agree with them on raises (I don't) they still could have resolved other issues such as class size based on the recommendations of the people in the front lines, the teachers.</p>

<p>"As for the class size issue, I am not convinced it should be discussed as a 'condition' of a collective agreement."</p>

<p>Why not?  What issue more than class size could affect a teacher's work environment?  If the Liberals put 300 kids in a class would the teachers still be seen as just looking for a raise?  </p>

<p>"I feel that the teachers would gain considerably more legitimacy for their views on class size if they made it a political campaign AFTER they were back in schools"</p>

<p>Like they did during the last election campaign?  Like they've done many times over the years?  Yes, that worked well didn't it.  Letters to the editor and the odd newspaper ad really got people's attention.  Fact is, only a strike awakens people to the issues because its the only time they pay attention. </p>

<p>"It is not the teachers' role to 'demand' that the government run schools to suit them."</p>

<p>Its not the government's role to refuse to listen to the recommendations of professionals as regards the conditions in their field, whether its lawyers, doctors, army officers, church ministers or the police.</p>

<p>$50.00<br />
The idea that teachers ENJOY giving up an entire day's real pay in order to receive a refund of $50. of their OWN money is an insult to their intelligence, not to mention ludicrous, but it is also a clear indication of how "bankrupt" some people's thinking is.  Pun intended.  The teachers have just been denied access to their own emergency savings, intended to help keep the wolf from the door, during times such as these, when a major real sacrifice is being made. </p>

<p>sthrendyle;<br />
An average secondary teacher has a "case load" of at least 30 students X 7 courses, that is 210 students (or soon 40 X 7 or 50 X 7)! Take the minimum of 30 students per class.  If an English teacher gives a student's written paper 10 minutes of attention, it will take that teacher 35 hours to mark 1 item, outside of instructional time.  During instructional time that teacher deals with 30 students at once!!  Now, speech therapy sounds like a cushy job, doesn't it?  </p>

<p>As you can see, if you pit people against each other, it is destructive.</p>

Quote from Yammer: "If the union keeps them out ... "  You mean "If they decide to stay out ... "</p>

<p>This province has moved so far from democracy that many people apparently can't even visualize its existence as manifested in the day to day organization of the BCTF.</p>

<p>sdgree, Yammer &amp; all those with "solutions":</p>

<p>All the great remedies that you suggest have been tried for years, and not only were teachers given NO support or public praise for their efforts to provide quality education, judging from your postings, some of you who are now suddenly interested, didn't even notice that this has been going on all the time.  It took a very dramatic action to open your eyes and you still don't see.  There is no "bargaining table"  It's long gone!</p>

<p>Teachers have made every reasonable effort known to humanity.</p>

<p>TIME'S UP.  </p>

<p>NOW YOU WILL SEE WHAT THESE PROFESSIONALS CAN DO!</p>

<p>Really? What option should the judge have choosen that would have ENFORCED the law she is duty bound to uphold? </p>

<p>Allowing a rich union to <span style="text-decoration:underline">remain</span> in contempt without threat of penalty would certainly be an incompetent response, so clearly some serious remedy was required. Many of the teachers I've heard say the decision was less harsh than they expected.</p>

<p>I'd also like to know how you get 'union busting' out of this judgement? The union was fined not even $1 - <span style="text-decoration:underline">nothing</span> was done to harm the union in the long-term. Only if the union disobeys the court's orders does it risk further penalties. </p>

<p>Simply because <span style="font-style:italic">you don't like</span> the outcome of a decision doesn't prove it is 'biased'.</p>

<p>It prevents the union from carrying out one of the prime reasons for its existence. Unions don't exist because people like the sound of the word, they exist to represent the people within the union.  If they're prevented from doing that they become ineffective.</p>

<p>How about if the law decided corporations couldn't communicate in any way with their workers and were not allowed to use the corporate bank account to advertise or pay its workers.</p>

<p>The first time you legislate an end to a labour dispute you may be justified; more time may be needed to bargain, or to allow tempers to cool and reason to return.</p>

<p>Wow, it sounds like the BCTF is on the path to sainthood. Up there with Mandela, Parks, and those that pioneered womens' suffrage and gay and other civil rights. The people of this province are so lucky to have this ever-benevolent organization stand up and fight the evil majority government democractically elected by, um, the people of this province. </p>

<p>I thought the electorate spoke in May, but now I see the BCTF proclaims to speak for the people of BC. They have a clear majority, with a whopping 0.96% of the population, to set public policy.</p>

<p>stump - who are you? - always fun to get fan mail on these boards. alas, i don't make enough in a year to arouse the curiousity of the tax man! as a comparison - virtually all of the major magazines and newspapers pay less than they did 20 - 25 years ago, and are mostly purchasing 'free' content given to them by CanWest contributors who've signed away all of their rights! no solidarity amongst freelancers. <br />
you might be interested to know that my 'freelance career' was kickstarted in 1987 when Canada Post decided to cut 7000 letter carriers from its workforce in order to give them 'the flexibility that they need to maintain profitability.' well, those cuts didn't happen, not all at once, but the sweet ride that most LCs had in the 70s came to a crashing halt. i suffered under no delusions that an essentially unskilled job that paid quite well was 'mine for life' - and took that little lesson on downsizing to heart. my ex LC pals are now close to retirement, god bless 'em, and despite email and other alternative forms of communication, still have their jobs. good on 'em. i can't imagaine how bitter i'd be (and i loved the work - not the politics) if i'd stuck it out. so here i am, posting blather on internet chatboards.<br />
as of 1 pm, the teachers are still mulling over their next move. i'm truly hoping that it's one that's back to the classroom. did you hear the little girl on CBC radio who said that it was 'about money' - from the mouths of babes, eh? a booming five percent. give me a break. (well, gordo actually did - i would bet that the Libs tax break put far more money into their jeans than the last ten years of 'settlements' combined...'</p>

As long as Judges are  appointed by politicians and not elected at large, they are going be be tarred with the same brush as their political masters.  Yah,I know.  They are appointed by the Feds, but so what? They are still political creatures. Does that give this Judge the right to suspend the teachers their basic rights?<br />
I think not. This Judge's action was predictable in more ways than one.This blanket denial of rights leaves this Judge wide open to reversal on appeal.</p>

<p>Frank claims:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">"Its not the government's role to refuse to listen to the recommendations of professionals as regards the conditions in their field, whether its lawyers, doctors, army officers, church ministers or the police."</span></p>

<p>WRONG. This is <span style="text-decoration:underline">exactly</span> their role. It is the role of these 'professionals' to make their case as effectively as possible, and it is the role of government to weigh this input along with every other factor and then choose the path or compromise <span style="text-decoration:underline">it deems appropriate</span>. It is the public's role to then <span style="font-style:italic">judge</span> the government's performance on these issues come election time. THIS is how government and democracy work.</p>

<p>To claim that public employees should <span style="font-style:italic">dictate demands</span> on how public services are run, and that the government must then acceed to them regardless of all other considerations is nothing but rhetoric. The fact that teachers would give up this 'demand' in exchange for a pay raise further illustrates that this issue is not what is at the heart of this dispute.</p>

<p>If someone here wishes to discuss the issue of class size in <span style="font-style:italic">its full context</span>, then let's start by a thorough examination of the costs and resources required to accomplish this goal. And what are the other areas of education that are completing for these same resources? When weighed one against the other, which is higher priority - both short and long term?</p>

<p>Let's also discuss the issue of demographics, which shows that primary and secondary school enrollment will DROP steadily for years to come. The demographic 'peak' is now becoming college age - this is where the biggest educational shortages are likely to be in the near future.</p>

<p>But no one seems really interested in looking at the issue from the larger perspective as our governments must. Instead people just parrot the one aspect that 'some' classes are too big 'today' - as if that is all there is too it. Then it is simply <span style="font-style:italic">assumed</span> that the government can just snap its fingers and solve the problem.</p>

<p>Should we rush to spend hundreds of millions for additional schools which will sit empty in 5 or 10 years? Should we rush to hire more teachers, even though we do not have the facilities for them? Or should we just kick special needs children out of public school all together?</p>

<p>But most here have no interest in learning anything about these issues beyond the <span style="text-decoration:underline">one perspective</span> voiced by teachers. While this viewpoint may be important and legitimate, it doesn't mean that government should 'negotiate' fundamental long-term educational stategies as part of a contract agreement. Teacher input and opinion should not be ignored, but it also should not be sole criteria for setting public policy - period.</p>

<p>The argument that 130 contracts were signed or "negotiated" as Shirley and Mickey like to throw out in the media, is a load of B.S. CUPE, IUOE, BCGEU, and all other public service unions were bullied in to accepting these contracts, they were not negotiated they were forced down our throats.This assumption by some like "freethinker" and his Liberal friends have bought right into the Neo-Con program. Freethinker my ass. I welcome the teachers to continue to fight for fair and just bargaining, as I know no other public service union that had the balls to take on these facists.</p>

<p>Kevin, you are wrong when you say democracy 'works' by voting a gov't and then if you don't like it vote them out in four years. lol</p>

<p>Democracy involves keeping your gov't honest every day via your MLA's (before this 'stick to the plan' bunch arrived) and one's political involvement in day to day issues and the running of one's province and city etc. Democracy isn't vote one day and shut up for the rest of the four years!</p>

<p>"It is the role of these 'professionals' to make their case as effectively as possible, and it is the role of government to weigh this input along with every other factor and then choose the path or compromise it deems appropriate.  THIS is how government and democracy work."</p>

<p>You claimed I'm WRONG and then agreed with me.  The government would not even discuss issues like class sizes and nor did it comromise in any way.  Nor could it since it didn't listen in the first place.  Democracy works by listening to the governed, not acting like a dictatorship or this democracy won't last long at all.</p>

<p>"To claim that public employees should dictate demands on how public services are run, and that the government must then acceed to them regardless of all other considerations is nothing but rhetoric"</p>

<p>I hope you start paying attention soon.  The teachers are not dictating, they are asking to be listened to.</p>

<p>"The fact that teachers would give up this 'demand' in exchange for a pay raise further illustrates that this issue is not what is at the heart of this dispute."</p>

<p>What?  Again, pay attention, the teachers gave up a pay raise in return for their recommendations being taken on the other issues, therefore your it is in fact the opposite of your statement that is true.</p>

<p>"If someone here wishes to discuss the issue of class size in its full context,..."</p>

<p>I have a better idea, how about the government we elected start discussing this issue with the workers on the front lines.  That might be more worthwhile don't you think?</p>

<p>"But no one seems really interested in looking at the issue from the larger perspective as our governments must"</p>

<p>Again you agree with me that the government must look at these issues.</p>

<p>"Teacher input and opinion should not be ignored"</p>

<p>It is being ignored - period.</p>

Personally, I hope Jim Sinclair grows some balls and calls for a General Strike. We MUST stand together, or we will all be plowed under.</p>

<p>I think the Fed will crumble too.  Too many of the executives aren't willing to get their noses dirty.  I believe the Fed will let teachers down as surely as night follows day but don't worry, they'll put on some nice rallies and maybe hire a funky group of street artists for entertainment. </p>

<p>I support the teachers but I would be interested to see what the posters on this board would say if the money issue was removed.  I'm not begrudging anyone a right to request a raise...heck I'd do it every chance I got.  </p>

<p>However, I believe that public support would sore even higher then it is if Jinny stood up and said "OK, we will take you at your word that a salary increase is coming next June" I can hear the groans about taking them at their word but we have to start somewhere.  </p>

<p>Once the salary demand is removed insist on agreed to settlement on all of the other issues...including class size and under funding.  </p>

<p>It is the under funding that drives me around the bend, for example even if this was all to end tomorrow, my daughter would not be returning to class until the week after next or Oct 24...why??? Because do to a lack of funding not only did this school district close schools but also decided that they would shorten the school year creating what is called a FALL BREAK...and an extended by a week SPRING BREAK...all this to save money.</p>

<p>Glad to see government is funding this.</p>

<p>RR Girl, The judge DID "<span style="font-style:italic">give the union a very light slap on the wrist</span>" (as you put it). No fine, no jail - <span style="text-decoration:underline">nothing</span> but a 'warning' to STOP being in contempt and supporting others to be contempt! What did you expect?</p>

<p>It would have been irresponsible for a judge to say "you were bad", but then let them walk out of the court to continue doing the exact same thing. Courts orders are not jokes to be ignored by those who disagree with them.</p>

<p>Anyone who <span style="font-style:italic">chooses</span> to defy a court order after being warned by a judge MUST be prepared to face heavy fines and/or jail. If the union chooses this course, then I will respect their conviction, but I cannot then cry for them when they are fined.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"the union really is the people. In spite of what you some of you like to pretend"</span></p>

<p>This statement is not true. A union is an 'organization' - a 'corporation' actually. It may represent the people and in turn be supported by them, but this does not make them one and the same. If the judge believed this, then she would have threatened fines against every 'individual' on strike - but she didn't. She dealt very narrowly with 'just' the union.</p>

<p>"The most bizarre action is her appointment of an overseer for the union's finances... She is overstepping by miles any reasonable opinion."</p>

<p>This is utter nonsense. Auditors and overseers are <span style="text-decoration:underline">common</span> in legal actions where orders are made regarding use of company assets. Plus the judge <span style="font-style:italic">explained</span> that she was unclear on how the union was structured and therefore how it might move money around through 3rd parties. Therefore the decision to assign an overseer was <span style="text-decoration:underline">reasonable prudence</span>. UNLESS the union was planning on <span style="font-style:italic">disobeying</span> the court, it will have no effect on their operations whatsoever.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that this judge is not 'for' OR 'against' the teachers - she is just doing here job. No harm was done to the union and no threats were made against teachers, but the authority of the court was upheld. It was a reasonable solution <span style="font-style:italic">in my opinion</span>.</p>

<p>However it is clear that many here will criticize anything and anyone that doesn't <span style="font-style:italic">favor</span> the teachers. Fine. I've nothing left to add and so will just agree to disagree.</p>

<p>There is a myth running through this thread ... and that is that teachers have negotiation as a choice.  The BCTF has always been willing to bargain.  The removal of the RIGHT to BARGAIN is a critical factor in this action.  Yet the message is still not making it.  If teachers go back to work right now, they have no right to bargain.  It is up to the government to open up the process.  Tell the government to BARGAIN.</p>

<p>Past experience re The Fed <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> the NDP says, you are likely to be right. </p>

<p>I still <span style="text-decoration:underline">hope</span> that you are wrong. </p>

<p>Still, being prepared for the worst from these compromised bastions is likely the more prudent course.</p>

<p>Regrettably there are not the working class structures, formal or spontaneous, legal or extra-legal, in place to take up from where these  <span style="font-style:italic">business union</span> institutions are <span style="text-decoration:underline">possibly</span> to abandon ship. Alternative bodies of trade union activists prepared to act outside their authority, if need be, should ideally be coming together now.</p>

<p>Again, I still hope you are wrong. Though hope is often a thin, un-nourishing gruel.</p>

<p>If they do fail teachers and us now though, remember them both next election.</p>

<p>Almost makes one believe the Fed is happy the judge said they can't help the teachers financially.</p>

<p>I could well be wrong and I hope I am, maybe they're just trying to get their ducks in a row.</p>

<p>I also know the NDP doesn't want to say anything that will make them look confrontational, but I say why not?  The election is over, there's not another one for almost 4 years and I could even understand their position if this was only about wages but its not.  The NDP are ignoring a fight over, as Luceo just noted, a union's right to bargain.</p>

<p>That's a pretty serious thing to ignore.</p>

<p>The liberals would love to make this about the NDP. They've been trying all week. Go to Hansard and see what the NDP as opposition did do fighting this bill.</p>

<p>Kevin, she did effectively fine the individual teachers fifty dollars a day.</p>

<p>Also, because she is not aquainted with the financial workings of the union is not a reason to appoint an overseer. It is up to a third party to bring a 'future now present?', infraction of a court order to the courts attention, is it not? Or, for the court to require a report of some kind?  Come on.</p>

<p>Also, you say a court order is to be obeyed. True. Until the court order is nothing but a tool of a fascist gov't. When the neo-cons decide to show contempt for the rule of law, it is not only the laws which they don't like that are made void. They don't get to choose which 'laws' and traditions are upheld. It puts all laws into peril. That is one of the destructive results of Neo-Conservative gov'ts.  Regardless, her ruling about the monitor  is to prevent future possible infractions she implies...Well, it seems more like a slap down. And, aninappropriate use of the judiciary. But, then I'm not a lawyer. Just a citizen, who perhaps naively, thinks justice should be the operative word in the justice system.</p>

<p>A real gov't's role is not to union bust. It is to provide balance between legitimate interests. We know this isn't a real gov't. So, how can the laws it enacts be real laws to be interpreted by real courts?</p>

<p>When a gov't betrays the public trust as this one has, what is the rule of the judiciary?</p>

 If they get 10% is that enough to improve the quality? Is 20% going to that much better again ?<br />
 The highest quality of education is usually higher at private schools where teachers are not generally paid as much as public school teachers.<br />
 Shouldn't we increase funding to private schools ?</p>

<p>Increase funding to private scchools?  What on earth for?  Those who want an elitist or religious education to set their children apart from the rest of society should be prepared to pay for it.  We should remove all public funding from private schools, they shouldn't get a single penny.  That money belongs in the public education system and would go a long way to alleviating the conditions that brought this action about.</p>

When the Labour Minister says he will talk to teachers after they go back to work the teachers simply do not believe him. He has had ample time and opportunity to deal in good faith before any labour action was contemplated and refused. Liberals LIE! simple and true. How do you deal with liars?</p>

<p>Where did that information come from?  Do you mean the highest quality or the highest marks?  While some private schools often score at the top when compared to public schools, the reason may not have much to do with the quality of education these students receive.</p>

<p>There are many reasons for this <br />
- many schools pull students from very advantaged homes(more emphasis on academics, more exposure to books, ideas, learning experiences, higher expectations)  <br />
- parent involvement may be higher, since they are paying fees.<br />
- the student body may be more homogeneous, without the wide range of abilities found in most public schools.</p>

<p>Another consideration is whether the quality of an education can only be measured by external test scores.<br />
- their class sizes may be smaller.</p>

<p>"Frank, the entire basis of your argument is that the government is 'ignoring' the teachers, yet nothing you say supports this claim."</p>

<p>Yes, it is the "entire basis" of my argument.  If I have said nothing to support my position I'm clearly not doing a very good job.</p>

<p>"Simply because the government chooses to not deal with the issue as part of a contract negotiation doesn't prove they haven't heard teachers' complaints."</p>

<p>The government has said they won't negotiate workplace issues such as class size, ESL, special needs etc and nor will they negotiate pay increases.  They have refused to negotiate workplace issues that the NDP did negotiate with teachers.  Their reasoning is that they're the ones elected and the teachers don't have any right to negotiate those issues in spite of the actions of past governments.  No pay increases are allowed to be discussed because the Liberals said so to everyone else.  Do we agree on that?</p>

<p>So to me I see nothing to be discussed except the weather.</p>

<p>However, I believe the government has an obligation in a democratic society to have sat down with teachers and discussed these issues.</p>

<p>To follow your example of </p>

<p>"The teachers would demand smaller classes - the government would say 'no, not right now'"</p>

<p>I would say the teachers could then say "why not and if not now, when?"  and so on.  They could also present their case as to why they believe class size matters, what the effects of ESL and special ed issues are and the government could hear them out and perhaps even become more educated themselves on the issue. </p>

<p>Instead the government has stonewalled.  They have not listened and nor have they given any reasons for their intransigence.  Nor have they provided any sort of timetable as to when they will deal with issues such as class size, ESL or special needs.  </p>

<p>"THIS TIME, the union has given no indication that they are willing to give up wage increases in exchange for class size adjustments"</p>

<p>Right, this time.  Because they feel they have already taken 0-0 and 0 in order to get input on those other issues.  I have heard teachers say if we knew we going to lose those things we would have taken the raise.</p>

<p>The Liberals have, as Bailey noted, already imposed one contract on the teachers and yet did nothing in the intervening years to create a better environment for discussion nor have they been willing to open the discussion to workplace issues or pay raises.</p>

<p>Their relationship with other unions has been about as bad.  Someone strikes, they legislate.  They never negotiate.</p>

<p>About the NDP opposition. I have been reading hansard ... my NDP MLA has been speaking up for education and stating his opposition to Bill 12. For some reason Mrs. Bond has not been listening. He has met and talked to us on the line. He has talked to our local press affirming his support for our actions.  What more can he do? <br />
By the way our superintendent spent some time on the line with is today. <br />
Interesting.  <br />
Also interesting is my co workers response to this latest ruling. More than one senior teacher has stated that they would rather retire early than continue to work with their tail between their legs. Our junior, mobile, teachers are looking at Alberta with clear interest.<br />
How many teachers will we loose due to this clear lack of respect.</p>

<p>Today my daughter Ale, who teaches at University Heights, called me to tell me she was feeling depressed about this whole thing and particularly about "the $50" that this piece by Schreck so well explains. I told her to read the Tyee and that soon she would be feeling better. This was the case. But then she tried to find out from me who Ron Erwin was. I was unable to explain the man.</p>

<p>On the issue of private schools I was recently taking photographs for a magazine at Collingwood in West Vancouver. I will leave it to some of you here to explain why it was that I saw so many young women and young men over six feet there. Collingwood could easily field several women's basketball teams. My guess is that it all has to do with their diet.</p>

<p>To TAA</p>

<p>No offence meant or taken but I know what it says.  I would like to see everyone be able to make the same quote their own then my wish would come true.</p>

<p>But the point I was making is that most politicians today are bankrupt of the most common of human triats and this government is a perfect case in point.  DO NOT EXPECT ANY COMPASION OR MERCY FROM THEM.  Any gains in this dispute are going to come from the courage and solidarity of first the teachers second the support Labour movement in BC and lastly the continued support of the moms and dads.  I believe the rank and file labour movement will not stand for another FED blunder like the HEU travisity.   If that should happen, I for one will be asking my local to withdraw from the FED.</p>

<p>Kevin Dalman: let me preface this post by saying that I enjoyed your post from about 45 mins ago.<br />
     I think you may be confused on the union issue. Unions are definately an organization. But I think you are confusing corporation with federation. Unions by definition are the sum of its members.<br />
As far as the BC Fed goes, I'm positive they are going over everything with a fine tooth comb with the lawyers.<br />
     General strikes are a very serious matter to be sure. And Jim Sinclair as the boss needs to know exactly what will transpire and all the consequences therein before he calls one. There are so many unseen variables in an action like this it boggles the mind. Being in the bush I hadn't yet heard of a rally monday by the FED. But a situation like that is a feeler. There is a point in this situation that the FED will have to step up. As others on this board have stated and I agree. I just hope they don't step down too fast.<br />
     I think we all know this will happen, it's just the timing. And the big factor "gordo just doesn't get it." Neither do his lackies.</p>

<p>to dsturdy:</p>

<p>R. Erwin invents his "facts" and does not have the skill to read or to interpret a bona fide educational report which includes any the variants which you have listed.  There is usually no evidence forthcoming on his assertions.</p>

<p>What does "The highest quality of education is usually higher ...." mean?  Does it mean that the lowest quality of education is usually lower at private schools?  Ask Ron for a reference, or a genuine study link, an ISBN number, or an author's name ... and wait for it.</p>

<p>SKEWED STUDIES.<br />
You know, of course, that when a private school can't handle a student's behaviour or can't deal with the parents' demands, the student is then sent to a public school.  As education is legally required, the public school system must take the child in, if there is a space.  It would be virtually impossible to achieve non-skewed results for comparative evaluation.  Many students of private schools are there simply because their parents are willing to pay so that their children receive religious instruction.  This is a moral rather than an academic decision.</p>

<p>West Vancouver public schools have a very low provincial pay scale, as do some private institutions.  This mirrors the fact that some teachers are willing to receive less, in order to teach in a specific environment.  It does not make them better or worse professionally.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"The government has said they won't negotiate workplace issues such as class size, ESL, special needs etc."</span></p>

<p>Right - 'as part of a contract negotiation'. Nor do they discuss how many hospital beds to add as part of negotiations with nurses. Nor do they discuss how many officers per citizen during police contract negotiations. These are "government policy decisions" that must be made based many factors - they are not "contract terms".</p>

<p>We can agree to disagree on this, but don't pretend that governments are 'obliged' to discuss <span style="font-style:italic">any issue</span> that public employees wish to throw in during contract negotiations.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"Their reasoning is that they're the ones elected and the teachers don't have any right to negotiate those issues"</span></p>

<p>Teachers have every 'right' to <span style="text-decoration:underline">speak out</span>, but have no mandate to 'force negotitations' on government policy as a contract demand, at least not in my opinion. As I said earlier, if they wish to act as a political lobby group, then it should be done outside of this arena.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"No pay increases are allowed to be discussed because the Liberals said so to everyone else. Do we agree on that?"</span></p>

<p>This is the Liberal line. I didn't say I liked it in this case. My point is that these are two different issues and should not be confused with one another. <span style="text-decoration:underline">I support teacher demands for better pay</span>, though I remain unsure that this strike is the best course for all involved.</p>

<p>My <span style="font-style:italic">point</span> is that wages is what this strike is <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> about - and I have no problem with that when honestly stated. I also don't doubt teachers' sincere concerns about class size, but this is not the reason they are walking the picket line. It is the <span style="font-style:italic">political spin</span> that tries to claim it is 'the issue' that I have a problem with.</p>

<p>I have no more time today, so I have to leave it at that.</p>

I'll take the top 16 students at any public school in this province, and put them up against the top 16 private school students and by and large the public schools child will win at any contest.</p>

<p>To believe the Fraser Inst. findings on BC schools as gospel (as Mr. Erwin will)shows that he skipped out of basic math class when they were teaching averages.</p>

<p>So what is this teacher labour dispute really about?</p>

<p>Certainly the BCTF can discuss matters like classroom size, composition, resources and the like, but such must not be included as a negotiation issue. Certainly the government should take note is these issues, then consult all the education stakeholders involved to resolve problems.</p>

<p>Teachers might be justified to seek a salary increase, in fact likely should at least be provided a reasonable COL value.</p>

<p>Again, the values in education cannot be just centered on what the BCTF demand. Parents, Post Secondary educators, school boards and the government are all important and equal players.</p>

<p>Again, the citizens of this province are providing a significant tax dollar in support of education, over $4.2 billion. Incrementally the education budget has increase virtually every year for the last 15 years. The per pupil grant is generous and definitely competes well with the rest of the Canadian jurisdictions.</p>

<p>So it appears about the only issue here is salary increases. But the government has indicated that ALL public service salary increases are targeted foo fiscal year 06/07.</p>

<p>But the BCTF does not want to wait for some reason. Why?</p>

                                <h3>I think it helps to separate the issues so we can discuss</h3>
<p>I think it helps to separate the issues so we can discuss this without being so polarized. But maybe some like the polarization as it works to their advantge.</p>

<p>1. Bill 12. Should teachers be able to strike? And if not, should they at lesat have alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as binding arbitration available to others deemed "essential services". My opinion is without such alternatives, Bill 12 looks like union busting. A big important issue to fight about, to strike about, to protest about, but let us not call this "for the sake of the kids".</p>

<p>2. Classroom conditions. This one IS for the sake of the kids. I personally would like them GREATLY improved and Liberals have failed on this. Itâ€™s about time some action was taken. But my opinion is that factors such as classroom size should NOT be part of negotiated contracts. Why?  I don't want them used as bargaining chips behind closed negotiation doors (potentially traded for things like salary). Just as I don't want doctors negotiating the conditions of my hospital or pilots negotiating plane safety. We need to improve conditions with a public, open forum involving parents, government and especially teachers. And we needed it yesterday. There is talk of this now but we need action. </p>

<p>3. The role of unions. Can/should unions be able to engage in civil disobedience and/or engage in actions counter to labour law? And if they break the law, is penalizing them fair? I think individuals should be able to engage in civil disobedience (sometimes it's the only way to change bad laws) but I do not believe our labour laws allow unions to fund civil disobedience. I also believe individuals or groups should face legal penalties for breaking laws even when done as civil disobedience (even when I agree with the civil disobedience or the fight of the protesters!). Why? Because even though I may agree with the outcome they seek to achieve, I also believe itâ€™s an inherent necessity that our laws are applied as consistently and neutrally as possible (at least until the law is changed). How much worse off we would be if the law only applied to some people and not others, depending upon whether we liked their cause or not. Sometimes this happens, but its wrong. I want my judiciary to read the law, and implement it, even when it runs counter to their personal beliefs. </p>

<p>Anyway these are just some issues that come to mind but they see all mixed up in the rhetoric. Seems to me if you really give a lot of thought to what is going on here, you can agree with some issues, and not others. And until these issues get discussed as separate issues, we canâ€™t move toward fixing all that is broke.</p>

<p>Kevin Dalman:</p>

<p>You may think that class sizes are not contract terms, but they HAVE BEEN in teaching contracts in B.C. in the very recent past.  There is plenty of precedent for their inclusion.  Arbitrators have left the articles intact.  The BCTF has an experienced bargaining team and lawyers and nothing has been "thrown in", as you state, during contract negotiations.  Rather, contract articles which were clearly defined and have been successfully implemented in some districts for years, have been "thrown out" unilaterally and without negotiation.  </p>

<p>Read the previous contracts.  Some of the class size and composition details are very specific and clauses in some districts also required assistance for special needs mainstreamed students over a certain number in one classroom.  Physical safety of students was also taken into consideration:- shop class sizes, science class sizes, etc. Who, in your legal opinion, ends up being held responsible if that oversized woodwork class causes loss of a hand?  Not the government and not you.  It's the teacher.</p>

<p>When they start to pile 5 or 10 people into one hospital bed, I hope doctors or nurses will get something in writing to say NO.</p>

<p>However you did miss one issue - teacher pay levels. This is where it all started. It is also an important topic for the general public as attracting and keeping good teachers is important to the social fabric.</p>

<p>But it is also true that this topic is the least contentious. I expect that at least 90% of British Columbians support better pay for teachers. The only real question is when and how much.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"You may think that class sizes are not contract terms, but they HAVE BEEN in teaching contracts in B.C. in the very recent past. There is plenty of precedent for their inclusion."</span></p>

<p>I understand that they have been terms in the past - and I do not 'blame' teachers for trying to make them so again. My point was that the government <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> be able to exclude specific issues if they choose to do so because not very issue or time is suitable for 'negotiating' public policy. </p>

<p>If the NDP <span style="font-style:italic">chose</span> to let teachers guide their educational policies, that is fine. But this doesn't mean that every other government must follow their lead in every instance.</p>

<p>I <span style="font-style:italic">want</span> this issue to receive attention and would like the teachers to continue to press their views as front-line workers. However I just don't believe this issue is a reason for keeping students out of school. That is really my point.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Teacher pay</span> is completely different however. I am still not sure this strike is the way, but I can see a justification based on the pay issue combined with the enforced contract. If this were the topic of discussion, then I would have little to say (believe it or not ;)</p>

<p>For the record, I also would have no problem with class size being raised a contract term if expressed in the context of a 'strain' on teachers <span style="font-style:italic">themselves</span>. For example, more stress, longer hours, etc. What I don't like is the pretense that this stike is all about the welfare of BC students - that is just union spin. This strike is about teacher self interest - exactly as it should be.</p>

<p>I have read the newspapers and seen the TV coverage on this with increasing amazement. There is almost an Orwellian quality to the descriptions of the purported disaster Judge Brown's order is supposed to be for teachers. </p>

<p>It was interesting to see the initial reaction from the employer's association lawyer. First, he was outraged. Certainly his first response did not suggest he thought the restraining order represented any sort of blow to the BCTF. He actually seemed to be in a state of shock. Within an hour or so, the lawyers and others, including the supposedly independent press were touting this order as brilliant, etc, etc, and the worst things that possibly could have happened to the BCTF, which was soon to be bankrupted. In other words, in the interim somebody got them "on message" - and typically the press pimped the ride.</p>

<p>Generally, teachers are described as crestfallen and devastated, demoralized, etc, etc - although there is scant evidence of this other than the fact that some guy named "Ratzo" went back to work because the strike pay was cancelled. Other teachers said they had friends and family and credit lines they could rely upon. I wonder if anyone at the Sun has heard of the BC Teachers Credit Union, for example? Don't you think teachers are capable of borrowing $50.00 a day from someone. And you know what, although express promises can't be made, I wonder if some of those loans might not be gifted away after the strike is over. In the meantime, other unions are able to chip in and get groceries and make sure rent or mortgages are covered.   </p>

<p>And thanks to the Brown order, the BCTF's war chest will be safely preserved by a court ordered trustee until the conflict ends. Far from devastating the BCTF doesn't the order really just amount to a set of guidelines the BCTF must now adhere too if the strike continues? It's more or less a manual for staying out without being snapped for contempt of court. Surely this couldn't have thrilled the gliberals. All statements to the contrary are cheap propaganda designed to try to encourage strike breakers by creating a sense of the inevitable. </p>

<p>The Government doesn't have the support of the public it expected, and now the courts have failed to come to their aid. The Government is in trouble on this issue. They are cornered. They could have left the teachers to withdraw within the limit permit of the LRB and they flubbed it. Now they have a BC Fed that HAS to start calling some days of protest here and there in order to protect other Fed members from getting the shaft too. Nice one Gordon. Well done Mike. Congradulations Shirley. You have brought upon the longest education strike in BC history, and you've got one more law suit to add to HEU and the Crown Attorneys - challenging the contracts you've ripped up, and the expropriation of wages on the basis that they OFFEND THE RULE OF LAW; Oh, the irony. This has disaster written all over it for government. Soon they'll eat crown and talk turket - because they have to.</p>

<p>"1. Bill 12. Should teachers be able to strike? And if not, should they at lesat have alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as binding arbitration available to others deemed "essential services". My opinion is without such alternatives, Bill 12 looks like union busting. A big important issue to fight about, to strike about, to protest about, but let us not call this "for the sake of the kids"."</p>

<p>Yeah, by the time it's all said and done, at the rate we're going, the kids won't have any unions to belong to. How sad, how very anti-thetical to everything our country is supposed to stand for.</p>

<p>This action is for the kids... and not just their education today, but also for their rights when they enter the workforce.</p>

<p>Another question that begs asking: why did the Liberals designate teachers to be an essential service? No other jurisdiction in Canada has done this. Schooling is extremely important, but not essential. Only services which deal in life and death matters are essential e.g. hospitals, fire and police services. If teaching was an "essential service" how is it that schools don't operate 24/7?</p>

<p>As for Judge Brown's ruling, I too am deeply concerned. With Wally Oppal in Campbell's cabinet, I'm afraid the line between the judiciary and politicians has been breached. I hear you BC Mary when you posted this earlier: <br />

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What has B.C. become, Guantanamo Bay?</span></p>

<p>Last thought. Can ordinary citizens organize aid for teachers? Can we donate money to them to offset their loss of strike pay? Can we loan them the use of photocopiers, cell phones, web sites...? Ideas???</p>

<p>That seems to be the sticking point with the business right wingers, they find it impossible that people would actually strike in order to win better learning conditions fot the STUDENTS! Teachers know that they cannot deliver quality education to a diverse class, (my wife is at a school where the STUDENTS are from 47 different countries) when class sizes are so large. <br />
LISTEN people, teachers are trying to tell you that the class sizes under the present government system are too large!! they are willing to put their livelyhood and their butts on the line to draw your attention to it and you can't seem to get it through your heads!<br />
Not everyone is exclusively interested in their bottom line, believe it or not!</p>

<p>I just came back from a teachers' union rally in the Interior.  What a wonderfully well-behaved crowd that had many members from the general public on hand.  Every soul there (and there were many) beamed with pride for standing up to this noxious government and it's contempt for the citizenry.  As we walked through our town to the rally, nearly every car honked in support.  I am proud of the citizens of British Columbia: they get it, this government has gone too far.  </p>

<p>Gordon Campbell's Liberals have tried to use threats, misinformation, isolation, legislation and freezing of our resources.  They have done nothing but steel our resolve and push public opinion away from themselves.  Even the corporately controlled media could not sway the public in this one.  The more mainstream media has tried to paint the teachers as bad and irresponsible, the more they have helped our cause.  The public knows its approximately 40,000 teachers and it knows they are good hardworking people.  I love Jinny Sims and I am proud of the way my brothers and sisters have conducted themselves throughout this whole ordeal.</p>

<p>Kevin,  </p>

<p>"don't pretend that governments are 'obliged' to discuss any issue that public employees wish to throw in during contract negotiations."</p>

<p>I believe they are.  If the police tell the government that they're unable to investigate 90% of crimes I would expect the government to listen to that.  If military officers say that without better armour they can't protect their troops I expect government to listen.  If teachers tell government that there's too many kids in their classes, too many kids requiring special attention and that educational outcomes may suffer I expect government to listen and do something about it.  It doesn't mean teachers dictate how the province runs, it means their front-line knowledge is recognized and valued.</p>

<p>"if they wish to act as a political lobby group, then it should be done outside of this arena."</p>

<p>I don't think class sizes and other issues fall into the arena of politics, I think they're well within the teachers purview.</p>

<p>The courts have already established a principle that where a teacher espouses views contrary to those of a free and democratic society, his or her inherent role model obligations are irreparably comprimised, which constitutes just cause for dismissal.  It is troubling to see teachers, in an essentially private dispute, attempt to undermine and challenge the fundamental institution of such a society, the rule of law and the power of a court to enforce compliance witht the law.  Yes, the government would be wise to extend some gesture of reconciliation, but the sanctions come from the courts, not the government.  Unions who challenge the courts are reckless and negligent in the trusteeship of assets place in their hands by union members.  I believe there had to be a revolution in England many years ago to demonstrate that no person was above the law, not even the king.  But I guess this kind of information has been replaced by peace studies or some such.</p>

<p>At the risk of offender Spector sensibilities by use of "exaggerated metaphor"  lawmakers with no sense of restraint quite commonly fall back on the rule of law when it suits there purposes. Hitler... Mugabe... Mao... Stalin... pick your poison. One of the reasons I am so deeply and unalterably opposed to the Campbell version of liberalism is because of the liberals' seemingly ceaseless misunderstanding of the concept of rule by law. It bothers me that the Campbell gang thinks rule of law means he who makes the law rules - and is free to tear up contracts, act contrary to international treaty, expropriate wages retroactively, arbitrate and then legislate away the results of arbitration, and otherwise legislate off the back of a napkin, ad hominen and as it suits them. It was stunning, slack-jawing hypocrisy to hear De Jong whining about US flouting of law on softwood. It is almost perverse to hear him calling teachers criminals.</p>

<p>Ever since the Magna Carta the government has been encouraged to act responsibly and to listen to his subjects.  James and Charles begat Cromwell.  </p>

<p>We have a parliamentary system that can charitably be called dictatorial except for voting day.  We do not have a system of checks and balances like the US.  In return we, the governed, expect the power of law and order to be used responsibly.  Peace, order and good government.  When a government turns a deaf ear to the people it hurts the system itself.</p>

<p>I see that we have lost many of the commenters that I loved to read on this thread but that we've gained many others.  The ones I read more carefully before are quite likely now busy elsewhere, supporting the struggle - or tired at the end of a busy week, like me,  and resting.</p>

<p>I also see that everyone is mad as hell here and finally talking like a democracy.  Democracy is no easy road....</p>

<p>If nothing else, that means that teachers have inspired debate - and also that The Tyee is there to support it.  God bless us everyone in that regard.</p>

<p>I will go to sleep tonight as a teacher-activist bouyed by many events and disheartened by very, very few this week.  Brothers by birth that I haven't heard from in a very long time phoned me to offer money. A couple of new honourary sisters on the local Parents' Association brought food to our house and offered to look after our children while we went out to the lines, etc.  Mexican teachers, whose struggle makes ours pale by comparison, are demonstrating in front of the Canadian Embassy in Mexico City, remembering the ways that B.C. teachers supported them in their struggle. The South African Teachers Association has offered us everything they have, "interest free". B.C. teachers are the news on five continents and listed under "labour", "justice", "privatization" and several other categories. (See LabourStart.org)</p>

<p>Just a final word of warning: </p>

<p>While I go to sleep content with my efforts in the battle tonight, Gordon Campbell will too.  There are a great number of neo-con (or neo-liberal) governments and powerful North American bodies behind him who intend to make this into the final battle between people and "power" (loosely translated as "money" in that vocabulary).  While Jinny and I and the rest of the subjects go to sleep for eight or ten hours, Gordo and friends will be wide awake and strategizing over how to put an end to this once and for all. This is no time to let down our vigilance.</p>

<p> So... Stay strong, warriors.  Wear your shields.  I'm going to rest now....</p>

<p>And thanks for everything you did this week to keep the front line strong.  Words are powerful and the words of support are what have kept me alive this week. (That and doughnuts.)</p>

<p>Just one request:  no moe doughnuts on the line please.  Bring us carrots and celery instead.</p>

<p>Sleep well friends.</p>

"General strikes are a very serious matter to be sure. And Jim Sinclair as the <span style="text-decoration:underline">boss</span> needs to know exactly what will transpire and all the consequences therein, before he calls one.<br />
Don't get me wrong, i'm on your side, but to refer to Sinclair as the "boss" is incorrect and leaves a bad taste in a trade unionist's mouth. Sinclair, is the elected leader of a large federation of workers in B.C. He only acts on the resolutions that are passed in conventions, and there are many regarding a cross-section of social issues, that we as workers deal with every day. When he is instructed by the sitting executive of the day (his cabinet, in other words), he has to respond. Regrettably, there are many fine resolutions that have passed in conventions, everything from teachers' strikes to peace protests, and the question from me is, when will he start making those pronouncements, that the rank-and-file workers have given him?The teachers are waiting! Remember WE are the BOSS!</p>

Another concern, I have, is the gag order that has been bestowed upon the teachers' leadership by this judge, and the fact that they cannot be counselled nor contacted by others in the general labour movement. Cetainly calls for a loud protest for "rights to assembly" in my view.</p>

<p>It's funny to hear the government's apologists braying about the rule of law. Funny how the legislation being contravened didn't exist two months ago. Funny how it's targeted at one specific group. I thought laws were for everyone. Why it's impossible to see that this law is the very opposite of how things are done in a true democracy is mind-boggling to me. But, given Ron Erwin's bizarre take on reality, and Nemesis inability to come up with anything better than name-calling these days, I guess I'm hoping for too much to expect the government's supporters to comprehend the finer points of justice for all.</p>

<p>"Seeing as the BCTF can no longer support this job action in any way, if teachers are forced to continue this protest, how could they possibly fine the BCTF? They didn't do anything!" Exactly luckylaine!!! That's why this court order is not nearly as devasting as liberal spin would have you believe. It's pretty hard to see how the BCTF could possibly be sanctioned for contempt for following the order. </p>

<p>That law, and the law they wrote to roll back HEU pay retroactively, and the law they wrote to get around the arbitrator's award with crown prosecutors, are all now subject of law suits. The suits will take time. I think the furthest one along is HEU, which will be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. Gordon may be changing his tune on the rule of law very soon...</p>

<p>Time to listen to the Be Good Tanyas I think they are called. My favourite non-classical album of late, when I'm nursing a drink or two. Blue Horse is the album. (Check it out, Lynn. I think you'd like it.)</p>

<p>It was a good support rally for the teachers our wee town had today. Everybody still seeming strong.</p>

<p>Bring 'em on!</p>

<p>Wonder what them Fed types are up to? They're my main worry. So long as they don't fold in on themselves, we'll whup these neoconazi asholes.

<p>Dave A, I can't get at the order, but I can quote from the rulling:</p>

<p>The BCTF is restrained for 30 days from directly or indirectly using its assets to facilitate breach of the court order of October 6, 2005.  In particular, the BCTF is enjoined from paying amounts to its members as â€œstrike payâ€ or to otherwise compensate members for loss relating to breach of the order of October 6, 2005; from providing guarantees or promises to pay to protect members from such losses; from using its books records and offices to permit third parties to facilitate continuing breach of the court order.</p>

<p>The order places limits on the BCTF. It doesn't say (and couldn't as a matter of law) that the "general labour movement" is prohibited from contacting teachers. So - feel free to loan your teachers friends some cash if they need it, and feel free to talk to them. Judge Brown didn't say you couldn't!!!</p>

<p>redrivergirl: (one more post since I just saw yours)</p>

<p>There are as I understand it a couple of legal proceedings in play here. The BCTF is suing the Gov and contending that stripping them of their right to withdraw services and extending the contract is unconsitutional (I think that's right - I might be wrong about the exact nature of the law suit). The other legal proceeding is the one that the BC Teachers Employers' Assn too to the LRB. The LRB ruled the withdrawal illegal. That order essentially got filed (registered) in Supreme Court where it became a court order. The second proceeding is a much faster process than the first. For example, the HEU are only now heading to the Supreme Court of Canada - though that dispute has been winding its away through the courts for years.</p>

<p>Great Post! I especially like this part...</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">Just a final word of warning: </blockquote></div></p>

<p>While I go to sleep content with my efforts in the battle tonight, Gordon Campbell will too. There are a great number of neo-con (or neo-liberal) governments and powerful North American bodies behind him who intend to make this into the final battle between people and "power" (loosely translated as "money" in that vocabulary). While Jinny and I and the rest of the subjects go to sleep for eight or ten hours, Gordo and friends will be wide awake and strategizing over how to put an end to this once and for all. This is no time to let down our vigilance.</p>

<p>Now this leaves two questions in my mind. </p>

<p>If there is no resolve by the government by Sunday afternoon, what is the BC Federation of Labour (AKA - the working people of BC) to do?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">1/</span> Starting Tuesday after the Monday rally rotating strikes around the province.<br />
or<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">2/</span> Starting Tuesday a full scale, province wide General Strike by all Unions AND all supporters of the teachers. This strike will continue if there continues to be no resolve and may even escalate nationally.</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer the latter. </p>

<p>Analogy - A cougar(the four-legged kind) is about to attack me and I have a club in one hand and a gun in the other. Do I wait for the cougar to get near me and bite, I then club it, watch it get up and bite me again, I club it, it gets up and so on...or do I just spend my shell and get it over with quick?</p>

<p>What are all your thoughts on this?</p>

<p>But class size and composition is not a bargaining issue! That is a local management issue.</p>

<p>The NDP put someting in the BCTF contract that ought not to have been put in. This was so the NDP would not have to provide large salary increases. Remember at the time the NDP government was a tad short of cash.</p>

<p>However that is not the major issue. The fact is that eh education of our kids is not just an issue between a union and government. Parents and others MUST be included.</p>

<p>At the same time there is no excuse for lack of resources, text books etc. The Librarian issue is still a bit vague.</p>

<p>Any attempt to better the school environment always stops at the budget.  There is no money for improvements.  Only erosion.  The downward spiral has picked up momentum since the Libs have been in power.  Teachers have NO other way to better the learning environment for our kids, as no one is listening.</p>

<p>Why not just outlaw all unions?  That would clear up this mess.  Make a law (you're good at that) that makes belonging to a union illegal.  Then invoke the notwithstanding clause to make sure it's constitutional.  Problem solved because your drain on the economy, the unions, are all gone.  You can then get back to making money.</p>

<p>I support the teachers in their plight; and to those of you who persecute them, there is a saying that goes "If I have to explain, you wouldn't understand" so, I won't bother. Think about this, all those teachers out walking the line including the 1000's of primary teachers who are probably the most nurturing, loving, giving and dedicated people on earth (not to say that all the other teachers aren't) but that group certainly, in my mind, exemplifies what the noble profession of teaching children is all about; yet the teacher bashing continues....what is happening to our society?</p>

<p>Sumctea,</p>

<p>They put this out today...</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Time for reason to prevail in government dispute with teachers</span></p>

<p>VICTORIA - NDP Education critic John Horgan today condemned Mike de Jong's lack of action on the teacher's dispute, saying that it was in the best interest of parents and children that discussions between government and teachers take place over the weekend.</p>

<p>"With 600,000 students out of school and parents struggling to make arrangements, the Campbell government has a duty to sit down with teachers over the weekend to find a solution to the crisis that this government created," said Horgan. </p>

<p>Horgan said that despite de Jong's insistence that he won't talk until teachers end their protest, there is nothing preventing serious negotiations over the weekend. He pointed out that the Campbell government negotiated with the HEU in 2004 despite a court ruling that said that job action was also illegal.</p>

<p>"The Premier and his Ministers have made this decision based on their political interest only," said Horgan. "In the interests of students, he needs to put aside the government's confrontational approach and work towards solutions, not aggravate an already tense situation."</p>

<p>Horgan said that 26 school boards are also calling on the government to negotiate directly with teachers. </p>

<p>"All parties involved in this dispute understand what the government must do - sit down with teachers and enter into real discussions about the issues at hand, class size and composition," said Horgan. "Teachers have already said that they are willing to meet any time any place. It is now up to the Premier and the Minister of Labour to take up that offer and get to work."</p>

<p>And Coyote, don't call me darlin', eh? My wife objects.</p>

<p>The general strike will not be a "general strike". It will be a "coordinated effort" - and we will be very careful about it all, for better or worse.</p>

<p>I think we're all smarter than we were in 1983 now. We strategize. Having recognized this as the end-game from the outset (2002 or so), a lot of planning has been involved. Not exactly a spontaneous worker's revolution, but the plan is to win.  And so is Gordo and friends'.</p>

<p>There would be no winning exit from a general strike in my opinion. Too many cards on the other side of the table.  We need to be smarter than them.</p>

<p>Jim Sinclair seems like a good guy for 99% of situations but when a union is being denied bargaining rights and forced to the wall by laws made up on the fly I want the Fed to be like a bunch of hungry attack dogs.</p>

<p>Coyote, I'd pay big bucks to actually see you, as Fed pres, on tv calling de Jong an "f'n **********" :)</p>

<p>sdgreen, kevin etc, maybe I'm misreading you but it sounds like you guys aren't that far off from agreeing with us that at the very least issues like class size deserve to be discussed (whether or not as part of a negotiation and whether or not it includes other parties), that the teachers deserve a raise, that two imposed contracts in a row is inexcusable and that passing laws just to attack your political enemies should be verboten.</p>

<p>I am quite certain Dalman is a Fiberal Staff officer. No one but could obfuscate reality better.</p>

<p>I picked up this information from a teachers thread on another site.</p>

<p>Legislation mocks Libs' own words <br />
By Bill Tieleman</p>

<p>"Bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny." </p>

<p>                                                                    - Edmund<br />
Burke, 1780 </p>

<p>The B.C. Liberals think they are above the law when it comes to dealing with<br />
teachers. </p>

<p>By imposing a contract last week on B.C. teachers instead of allowing them<br />
to continue with free collective bargaining, including the democratic right<br />
to strike, the Gordon Campbell government once again showed disrespect for<br />
the law. </p>

<p>And that law is even of its own making. </p>

<p>In 2001 the B.C. Liberals passed legislation to make education an essential<br />
service. That means in a dispute the B.C. Labour Relations Board would<br />
determine what level of services teachers must provide if they strike. </p>

<p>The government was quite clear that it was not - repeat not - eliminating<br />
teachers' right to strike. A government news release dated Aug. 14, 2001 was<br />
crystal clear about Bill 18. </p>

<p>"The legislation maintains the right to engage in free-collective<br />
bargaining, and teachers and support workers continue to have the right to<br />
strike," it stated. </p>

<p>But last week's new legislation makes a mockery of the government's own<br />
words. </p>

<p>No one should be surprised that the Liberals lack respect for the law, even<br />
when they write it themselves. </p>

<p>This same government used legislation to overturn legal agreements to use<br />
binding arbitration to settle contracts with doctors and provincial Crown<br />
counsel. </p>

<p>The Liberals also ripped up mutually negotiated contracts between employers<br />
and hospital workers, nurses, teachers and health sciences workers, despite<br />
explicit promises by Campbell not to do so before he was elected premier. </p>

<p>The Liberals like to change the rules in their favour but they are too<br />
cowardly to introduce legislation banning workers' right to strike.</p>

<p>Just curious.</p>

<p>There has been a tremendous amount of time spent in speculation and debate here about this issue. For many of you, I expect it has been informative and has helped you deepen your understanding.</p>

<p>At the same time, I would be interested in what political action you have taken to resolve this dispute.</p>

<p>Postings of such actions could be a powerful tool.</p>

<p>As for me, I'm strike coordinator in a local and haven't had any time for on-line debate. I do know that on Friday, a staff rep came to see me to tell me that a member of staff is in financial trouble. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to help when our local assets are frozen.</p>

<p>Clarity of purpose is important; principled action is essential.</p>

                                <h3>Unfortunately for the teachers and other public sector</h3>
<p>Unfortunately for the teachers and other public sector workers who are looking at more 0,0,0 mandates from this government, I don't think a general strike is there for them. And its not because people don't want it. The leadership at the BCFED (somewhat an oxymoronic statement right there) has shown in the past that they'll go only so far in this regard then cut the deal and put an end to it.</p>

<p>When Gordo the drunken premier makes statements alluding to the fact that he hopes the BCFED is at the "roundtable" discussion on education to be held in a week or so, one wonders why he would look forward to having an organization so diametrically opposed to his nonsense across the table from him.  Unless he figures that he can make deals with them, much the same way deals were made on the 3 years @ 0 mandate by another union. Whether you're a teacher, an HEU worker, a school support employee, or a myriad of other employees that have had to stomach 3 years at 0, while particularly this year, the Consumer Price Index and the inflation rate are climbing steadily higher, you must be sick and tired of hearing about the record surplus, then being told that there's no money for raises, this year or next.</p>

<p>As for Carole and the NDP, the fact is that they cannot be seen to officially support in a public way, an illegal job action, for optical and other purposes. That doesn't mean that they don't support the teachers efforts to gain a fairly negotiated collective agreement. And on a personal level, how can a government led by a convicted criminal, a government who has repeatedly been condemned for breaking contractual law, by legislation, and its so called minister of labour (even though he lost a substantial amount of weight.... he's still the biggest bag of wind in the legislature), sit there and go "tsk tsk" at the teachers.</p>

<p>When it comes to acting illegally and immorally, sorry folks, its not the teachers that lead the way..... its the Campbell Fiberals. "When in Rome....."</p>

<p>I thought that the ruling was a fair one for the most part, from a judge who's having the opinion of keeping her nose out of it and not being blamed for any escalation of the dispute. The government is the one that needs to make the next move, repeal Bill 12 and get back to the table and try a new tactic... NEGOTIATE FAIRLY. But unfortunately, Campbell and his band of twits can't do that now. They have a weak knee'd minister of education and a blowhard minister of labour that have painted them into this corner.</p>

<p>And Convict Campbell is still governing like he's only got 3 members opposing him. You can hear the wardrums beating, first its the teachers, then the doctors, then the GEU, then the School Support employees and on and on and on.... Campbell wants 0,0,0 to continue..... and people are fed up with it.  3 words..... SHUT HER DOWN!!!!!</p>

<p>GW North...</p>

<p>In hindsight, you're right about the ruling and the slippery slope. But based on law, her ruling might be "appealable." But then what's the remedy for the "contempt of court"? Unlike other judges, I think this one attempted to look at the entire picture, sees what the gov't has done and acted, and taken the position of trying to eliminate the ongoing contempt of court.  Resolve the issue rather than step in and make it worse.</p>

<p>But I didn't see too many teachers running back to the classroom after the ruling.  If the dispute was only about $50 a day, that might have been a huge issue. Clearly its about more than that. I hate to say it, but it looks like it might take some heavier action to resolve the contempt issue. But if they do throw Jinny and the executive in the clink, they should also throw Shirley Bond, Mike deJong and Gordo in there too. Maybe not gordo, it might bring back fond memories of his Maui Owie tour. Ahh what the heck throw his ass in there too.  Maybe there's a bubba in the clink looking for a new girlfriend.</p>

<p>I talk to teachers here in Alberta, and it seems to me that a large source of frustration is the diversity of abilities that teachers must cope with.<br />
Class size per se is not the real issue but having kids with inordinate differences in abilities make it difficult to teach to the middle. <br />
When I went to school we were streamed. The class size wasn't a big deal, since the ability levels of the kids was reasonably close. We also had a concept of failure, which does not exist now (The School Boards don't allow kids to fail). Teachers also have to cope with the kids from dysfunctional homes and the discipline problems that come from this.<br />
I know this is heretical talk, but it is true. Pay teachers well, bring back streaming in the classrooms, have "special" classes for "special" kids, and a lot of frustration will disappear.</p>

<p>Hi kegler:</p>

<p>The remedy for contempt of court is to lesgislate retroactive laws that rescind the bad legislation of the past.  I believe that Bills 27,28 &amp; 12 are the pieces of legislation that come foremost to mind.  Certainly there are other contemptuous mountains of legislation. If the government can do this, they will show that they can learn from their mistakes.  As long as heavy-handed legislation, that takes away people's rights, freedoms, and means of maintaining personal safety is on the books, there can be no trusting this government.</p>

<p>Indisputably, Health and Education are the most costly items of the Provincial budget.</p>

<p>When I went to school my desk had an inkwell and students were provided three writing tablets(exercise books), a pen and pencil. Textbooks stayed in the classrooms.</p>

<p>I rather suspect that educating a child today is somewhat costlier.</p>

<p>There is little doubt in my mind that healthcare costs have been doubled by a venal  pharmaceutical industry - coupled with many abuses in the system.</p>

<p>The last thing I wish to do is to turn teachers and healthcare workers against each other. I just wish this Campbell gang would challenge the pharmaceutical industry and those many healthcare abuses with the same verve and tenacity with which it attacks teachers and the BCTF. There is much money there to be had.</p>

<p>The NDP, at least, had the courage to take on the doctors but were finally spooked by the Opposition and its compliant mainstream media.</p>

<p>Come on, BC Fed. To scuttle the creeping fascism, workers all have to get together on this one</p>

<p>Dave A: thankyou for pointing out my error last night. I used a poor choice of words to describe Jim Sinclair's position. As I do have a fair education (but no typing skills) and was getting tired, I also got lazy and used the shortest word that came to mind.</p>

<p>Also to someone else who stated that no other jurisdiction in <span style="font-weight:bold">Canada</span> has designated teachers as a essential service. In fact no other jurisdiction in the <span style="font-weight:bold">free world</span> has done so.</p>

<p>For those of you who still don't get the big picture, and the government lackie spin doctors on these boards:The government knew way back before they even lied to us about giving educstion "the highest priority" what they were actually going to do. The scenario goes something like this.<br />
Gordo: we have a situation where we need 9 more months to complete our forced knuckling under of the public sector unions.<br />
Mike and Shirley: What's that?<br />
Gordo: The teachers need to be brought into line<br />
Mike and Shirley: How are we going to accomplish that?<br />
Gordo: Well with big business and the newspapers backing us we will first have the BCSPEA knuckle under to our instructions by ordering them not to discuss wages. We know this will be a strike issue because we imposed the last contract on them. So we need legislation to order them back to work. We also will need public support so we order them not to discuss class sizes or special ed children.<br />
Mike and Shirley:And then what?<br />
Gordo: well then we wait for the teachers to move. They will commence job action and Mike that's where you come in. You get a Labour ruling that the job action is illegal and at the same time we will introduce a law that bans a strike.<br />
Mike and Shirley looking befuddled, hesitate.<br />
Gordo: if you don't put this scenario into place I will do a cabinet shuffle an move you to the back benches.<br />
Mike and Shirley: Okay Gordo.<br />
Gordo:Besides we will have the parents and Media on our side. It's win win.</p>

<p>What this moron did not consider in his equation is the teachers walking out in civil disobediance of a very bad piece of legislation. What he further didn't realize is that the parents were wise to not only him but the newspapers and other media.<br />
I'm sure he also didn't realize that some schoolboards would speak out against him. Nor the fact that the media seems to be pulling away from this issue. Could that be because circulation and sponsorship is dropping.I think so. IMHO</p>

<p>With smaller class sizes and caps on the numbers of special needs students in the classrooms, the needs of diversity can be addressed.  If we can work through these issues for a generation or two while providing good (integrated) support services for families, our society will grow stronger.  With downsizing, the poor and the weak have become more disenfranchised.  A call for mainstreaming is not the answer.  This causes mistrust and segregation in our society.  This causes further disparity beteen social groups.</p>

<p>As it stands, disparity between rich and poor has increased as have crime-rates in this province since this government took power.  This is a travesty in a land that is as resource-laden and well-educated as ours.</p>

<p>Mr. G., the response to your inquiry might be slow because people tune into web discussions at different times. Trust that coming to a supportive public forum like this is a good decision.</p>

<p>I think GWNorth's suggestion is the best one, but also I would encourage the nonunion supporters of your strike to also make their positions clear to financial officers at their local credit unions and banks. In my community, it's easy because the liberals are pretty much universally despised, so that amounts to a great deal of clout. </p>

<p>Put out an appeal to local area residents and business owners to chip in. The usual jerks will always respond like jerks, but trust that the quality of education is among the highest priorities of residents in this province and most of us want you to succeed.</p>

<p>Gary, Mr. Campbell thought he had the parents onside because the gang running the BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils -- BCCPAC, the self-proclaimed and government-recognized "voice of BC parents" -- have been at war with the BCTF and in bed with the Liberals for years.</p>

<p>What they have overlooked is that growing disillusionment with BCCPAC means that currently, half the province's PACs don't belong to BCCPAC, half of those who belong don't actively participate, and most of the parents in any school have little to do with their own PACs. For example, only about 25% of Vancouver schools were active BCCPAC participants last year, and probably only a handful of parents from those schools actively participated in any positions taken in the BCCPAC process. </p>

<p>This anachronistic bunch is (for the most part) only a few steps removed from a 1950s luncheon club of Liberal white housewives. So you get the BCCPAC president being quoted repeatedly by all the official media, expressing a supportive position that is entirely out of touch with the grassroots in most BC communities.</p>

<p>This has encouraged the Liberals to go out on a limb where a more accurate take on the mood of parents would have prompted them to tread far more cautiously.</p>

<p>They're also proposing that BCCPAC serve as the sole voice of parents at this "roundtable" solution, which is certainly not going to win many hearts and minds, given BCCPAC's record of focussing on confrontation with the BCTF instead of standing up to the Liberals for students/parents on issues re class conditions and eroding resources.</p>

<p>What is the end game?  Where is the way out?  How does Gordo get the Jinny back into the bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. DeJong has been given the opportunity to save face this weekend.  </p>

<p>DeJong has said he will meet with the teachers 24/7 when they get back into the classrooms.  </p>

<p>Teachers are ready to meet with DeJong 24/7 but will not go back to the classroom unless there is a negotiated contract.</p>

<p>Teachers don't teach on Saturday and Sunday Mr. DeJong. This is your chance to solve this.</p>

<p>The solution is to meet this weekend and get a negotiated contract.  Again, teachers don't teach on Saturday and Sunday Mr.DeJong.  Think outside of the box a little and go for a creative compromise.  Jim Sinclair has given you the perfect out.  Can you not see it?</p>

<p>Meet with the teachers and get the contract done this weekend!!  What an end run that would be.  You could be the hero Mr. DeJong instead of the goat.</p>

<p>The teachers can vote on Monday and be back in class if the government shows it is willing to negotiate a fair and reasonable contract.</p>

<p>Negotiate this weekend and get the kids back in school instead of making more threats that are just going to anger more people and cause more trouble and keep our schools closed. </p>

<p>It is already hearly high noon on Saturday and you are pissing away the last few hours you will get to defuse this before a general strike. The clock is ticking away the last hours of your government's ability to head off anarchy.  </p>

<p>Mr. DeJong, is your duty to show some leadership and fix this mess.  Now pick up the phone and call Jinny before this last chance is wasted and the province is further damaged.</p>

<p>I repeat, teachers do not teach on Saturday or Sunday, this is you chance to solve it if you want to and have our kids back in school on Monday.</p>

<p>I sat on a Ministry panel for more than one year with other education professionals, business leaders, students, and Ministry officials.  Also included in that group was the BC PAC Chair.  I will not name this person; but, I found this person to be uninformed and misguided.  This person promoted segregation and curricula that was driven from the top as opposed to teaching to meet individual need.  The participants of that roundtable were very polite in their personal battles to refrain from rolling their eyes and sighing deeply as we had to listen to this person.  </p>

<p>I must concur with NAME, above.  My experience tells me that PACs are probably not presently a good source for finding capable, educated and enlightened parent leaders to have on a panel representing the needs of students.</p>

<p>jbrooks, I would prefer schools focus on the children's need for learning, not competition.  As it is they're all supposed to finish a grade at the same time.  Yet that ignores the fact they have different mental abilities that may cause some kids to just need a little longer to complete a grade.  It also ignores different circumstances such as maybe one kid goes home to two supportive parents who help with homework and provide encouragement while another kid, just as bright, has to search the local area for his parent.</p>

<p>In a perfect world there wouldn't even be year-long grades.  Kids would just move from level to level at their own speed.</p>

<p>Forget "failing".  All kids should just be encouraged to learn without worrying about the clock.</p>

<p>the media and the govt should spend time in actual classrooms where there are:<br />
regular students - nerds , brats, punks, social climbers, etc.<br />
handicapped students - mentally physically, emotionally.<br />
teacher - ill equipped to dispense knowledge equally, or even adequately to all, maybe any, under the current system.<br />
teacher aides - maybe someimes, maybe not at all.</p>

<p>the education system is the greatest asset we have. period.</p>

<p>it is seriously flawed.<br />
it has to be fixed, or it will become broken down and useless, like anything else that is abused and neglected.</p>

<p>gordon dumbell thinks he can fix it by ordering the teachers to work harder. their reward will be, well, they will not go to jail.</p>

<p>every single student will be as disserved as they have been since the first day dumbell had power.</p>

<p>education minister shirly bond (the invisible woman), and labour minister mike de jong (why is he even involved?) are simply the messengers of gordon dumbell's education policy - every child left behind except my friends' children, as they can afford private schools.</p>

<p>maybe if the messengers were treated in the old fashion......</p>

<p>i like the photo of gordumb. it should be the only one available of the premier, ever.<br />
drunk on martinis behind the wheel of a car, drunk on power at the wheel of everyone else's future as govt leader.<br />
which is worse?</p>

<p>you have to like mike de jong. all he needs is a little red ball on his nose, and his hair dyed green, and - you guessed it - krusty!</p>

<p>this govt must be sent a message.<br />
do your job.<br />
any moron can bully the weak if he has a big enough stick.<br />
a leader ought to be smarter that that. lots smarter.<br />
if we do not stop gord now, he will take it as a ringing endorsement of his arrogant and abusive behavior.</p>

<p>Those of us with supportive PAC groups (or individual members of the PAC) need to reach out to them and give them ideas.  I phoned ours, though I was out on a limb. After a 20 minute conversation, the pres. phoned back some hours later to indicate they'd be pushing both BCCPAC and gov't. to meet with us to discuss a resolution NOW. That's a start. Some of the PAC members are looking for ways to help, but don't know what to do.</p>

<p>Idea for you Mr.Gimpy:<br />
-Take a risk. Phone potential support on PAC and in the public. Give them at least one idea, such as writing letters/emailing/phoning to enourage a meeting. Or walking the line with us. Get THEIR phone trees started up.</p>

<p>Under the tutelage of the current government, our children are being forced to compete more and more.  This is evidenced in new regulations requiring report card marks for primary children (including kindergaten!) and in provincial exams being mandated for Grade 10 Science, English and Math; Grade 11 Socials; as well as the Grade 12 exams that still exist.  These measures do not improve student learning.</p>

<p>I challenge each and everyone of you. It's time for action. Let's turn this into a forum about ways in which we can resist this government.</p>

<p>Postings of practical actions on this list has the potential to make it a powerful tool for political action.</p>

<p>Thanks again you Te Aro Arahina</p>

<p>4 ideas. It's a start.</p>

<p>1. Work collectively to approach financial institutions in the event of the denial of lines of credit or foreclosures.<br />
2. Collectively includes reaching out to non-union supporters to "chip in". To what or how this might be organized is still not clear but we're on our way.<br />
3. An appeal to local area residents and business owners to chip in. Good. An appeal by whom and how. Let's put some wheels on these.<br />
4. Great. Impromptu demonstations by students.</p>

<p>Clarity of purpose is important; it's time for principled action.</p>

If I did what Gordon Campbell did in Hawaii, here, in BC, I would be a convicted felon, sent to jail.  I am not sure, but I would probably lose my teaching certificate as I would be unfit to lead a classroom full of students.  The teachers are soberly engaging in civil disobedience to stand up to bullies and injustice.  Teachers, and the lion's share of the public, do not see teachers' behaviour as wrong.  They are behaving in a ethically and morally principled manner.</p>

<p>jacked,<br />
You are correct.  The public gets it.  The more deceit that these editorialists spew, the less they will be trusted in the future.  After working on education issues for many years from within the system, I must say that they do not properly research their ideas; and they do not give the public a balanced and thoughtful picture of the education issues to which they speak.  I, now, rarely buy their papers as I have little faith that any issue will be treated fairly.  I don't like supporting misinformation: half-truths and outright lies.</p>

<p>Umslopogaas, a good post directly above here.</p>

<p>Now, my sense is that the government, 1) remains unconvinced that they can't win this one, 2)they haven't come all this way, as part of a neoconazi movement begun in the lead up to 1983 and Operation Solidarity, on the part of the "special interests" they represent, to retreat at the <span style="font-style:italic">second</span> sign of a fight. </p>

<p>Afterall, fundamentally, they did win the first 1983, Operation Solidarity round, in that their was no comprehensive "social contract" agreement with labour that they would not continue with their slash and burn approach to working class interests. And don't think for one second that they are not aware of that, and that thus far from there, they do not have the weight of precedent on their side, and a history of labour vacillation, organizational decline and unwillingness to wrestle them to the ground on this issue of who rules and decides the major issues of society. This is a capitalist society afterall, and it is that class interest they speak for, and they have a great deal invested already in rolling the social clock back to a time before trade unions and post WW2, what came to be called <span style="font-style:italic">socialized capitalism.</span></p>

<p>So whilst I respect your urgings, and you are entirely correct, my own view is that it is going to take an <span style="font-style:italic">overwhelming</span> demonstration of raw, yet thought through working class power to bring this State regime up short. </p>

<p>That done however, it would be a mistake to stop there, for history tells us that all we will have achieved at that point even, presuming we even get to there, is to delay further attempts to another time and in other forms to secure the same result. This Neoconazi policy regime we are up against is not confined entirely to BC, or even just Canada, but is a manifestation of a <span style="text-decoration:underline">process</span> begun in Thatcher's England and Reagan's USA that has gone throughout Capitaldom, most recently being forced through as the social agenda, with social democratic co-operation, in Germany and France, for example. This neoconservative/fascist agenda is policy arrived at and initiated at the highest levels of global ruling class corporate capitalism, to the very level of the Bildenberg Society itself. (Google Bildenberg society or group.)</p>

<p>It is ruling class capitalist policy everywhere.</p>

<p>Which says to me, that the BC Lib/Con/Socred Grand Alliance, as the arm of that policy here, as the Paul Martin Liberals are emerging federally, are not going to quickly or lightly lay down here, I am sorry to say. And I anxiously await to be proven wrong on this.</p>

<p>From previous post...</p>

<p>It would make for much simpler a world.</p>

<p>I think we have to begin to understand right here and now, that what we are launched upon, I hope, I think, is a major struggle within the very core of the socio-economic system itself to defeat the capitalist ruling class world view of the future. </p>

<p>Which doesn't mean that we can't win this fight and wrestle them to the ground here-, but merely that we must not be content with that, and the day after go about our business as usual thinking that we have resolved the problems of our future entirely. That would be naive in the extreme, I think.</p>

<p>What we have to be launched upon in its fullest dimensions is, a struggle to create a NEW <span style="text-decoration:underline">social contract</span> within the very socio-economic order itself-, that includes us, at the least, as a major and <span style="text-decoration:underline">ruling</span> power and player within the economic and all other institutions of society.</p>

<p>That means, to fully resolve the problems of this period within the direction of capitalist development itself, which <span style="text-decoration:underline">they</span> see as increasingly autocratic and restricting to ourselves and our interests, we need to see quite diametrically opposite. We need to build<br />
a <span style="font-style:italic">power</span>, rooted in the majority working class, embracing the poor and progressive middle class elements, that can actually challenge current ruling class power, and <span style="font-style:italic">force</span> through qualitatively higher levels of democracy and working class participation in the ownership, management and direction of the "major" economic institutions of the social order, ever increasingly circumscribing that ruling class power. (<span style="font-style:italic">Which doesn't either preclude "force", or exclude it. That is decided not just by us, but the dynamics of the process and all the forces within it.</span>)</p>

<p>So while I certainly do not see this teachers' strike going to that level of things at this time, we need to see it, hopefully, barring another failure of Labour resolve, as the opening battle to secure a precedent of victory for teachers and ourselves, and to lay the organizational and political foundations for the battles yet to come, in what is likely to be a longer fought out war from here. Failing that, we will be back here again, again and again ad infinitum, until we do see the larger and broader dimensions of what is taking shape here.</p>

<p>Thanks Cuinn. By the way, any takers out there? Ready to take action and start phoning your neighbours or finding out who the chair of your local parent advisory committee is?</p>

<p>Let other bloggers know what you are planning to do.</p>

<p>1. Work collectively to approach financial institutions in the event of the denial of lines of credit or foreclosures.<br />
2. Collectively includes reaching out to non-union supporters to "chip in". To what or how this might be organized is still not clear but we're on our way.<br />
3. An appeal to local area residents and business owners to chip in. Good. An appeal by whom and how. Let's put some wheels on these.<br />
4. Great. Impromptu demonstations by students.<br />
5. Phone potential support on PAC (Parent Advisory Committee) and in the public. Give them at least one idea, such as writing letters/emailing/phoning to enourage a meeting. Or walking the line with us. Get THEIR phone trees started up.</p>

<p>Clarity of purpose is important; it's time for principled action.</p>

Parent groups are already circulating</h3>
<p>Ideas for action:</p>

<p>Parent groups are already circulating info sheets with e-mail contacts for the Premier, Ministers De Jong and Bond and MLAs and encouraging people to contact them. Vancouver parent Charles Menzies has set up a special Website to help parents coordinate support for teachers at <a href="http://www.npweblog.ca" class="bb-url">npweblog.ca</a> </p>

<p>Meanwhile, 26 school boards have now passed motions urging the province to withdraw Bill 12 and meet with the teachers. </p>

<p>* We can ask our school PACs to support and promote such efforts -- writing letters and organizing demonstrations of support on the picket lines (and I was not implying that all PACs were useless in my post above -- the key problem is BCCPAC's leadership or lack thereof --"SharingIsGood", your description fit to a T!). </p>

<p>* We can ask PACs and DPACs to pressure BCCPAC to take a stand as many of the school boards have done.</p>

<p>* We can ask the school boards that have not yet spoken up denouncing Bill 12 to do so.</p>

<p>* School trustees are facing re-election: we can ask sitting trustees and school board candidates to speak up re rescinding Bill 12 and urging government to meet with the teachers.</p>

<p>* Employers must be feeling the pinch of employee parents who are hamstrung by the strike, and the prospect of broader labour action -- encourage them to start putting pressure on the province.</p>

<p>* The Liberals will be polling quietly and monitoring the drift of letters published in local papers to gauge the public mood -- so keep sending letters to the papers.</p>

<p>* We should copy letters and e-mails to the Opposition Education critic (Jim Horgan?), as the Legislature will be sitting again next week.</p>

<p>* Parents can also network to support each other with child care, as the practical aspects are important to maintaining support if we're in for the long haul.</p>

<p>I think Coyote is very right above.  This is not a casual or trivial matter for the Liberals and their backers.  It's the latest step of a well thought long term strategy for restoring a social order from the past.</p>

<p>They may give in here and there to gain a positional advantage, but no-one should imagine that this will be an easy win, or that it will end here.  </p>

<p>There's a decision to be made here, a big one.  About who we really are and how we wish to live as a people.  Will we be civilized people, creating a whole way of life in which all the different aspects of human life are accomodated and all our potentials honoured?</p>

<p>Or will it be all about looking out for number one, and screw the weak, the old and the poor?</p>

<p>Those who would choose the latter are rich, sly and unscrupulous.  As you'd expect from someone with such a life goal.  They will not give up until they're made to.  And the only way to do that is to keep them clearly in sight, and insist on better.  </p>

<p>Every single time.  Even when it's hard.</p>

<p>Are there any old Wobblies reading this thread who might explain to some of these commentors  the benefits of having a non-registered union?</p>

<p>In essence that is what the BCTF is for the remainder of this dispute unless the good judge Brown has a change of heart.</p>

<p>As someone noted somehwere in the thicket above, the BCTF is no longer liable for any actions that take place after the court ruling.</p>

<p>It has been effectively removed from the fight, so every teacher is effectively on their own.</p>

<p>But most of us here know they are not alone, they are part of our communities, they are part of our struggle and I surely hope they are a major and glorious part of our future.</p>

<p>If they aren't then the right-wingers, especially those that call themselves left, but condemn the teachers leadership and urge teachers to cave in, will be among the most vocal when their children fail in education, fail in the workplace and, in general, fail in life.</p>

<p>Back to my Wobbly friends. The International Workers of the World grew out of the type of social chaos we are living today in BC.</p>

<p>Despite having any no formal recognition other than as an object of fear and hatred to be abused by the elites in society, the IWW managed to attract tens of thousands of workers across this continent.</p>

<p>People joined the Wobblies as much to force change as to gain immediate benefits.</p>

<p>It didn't change the world, but it did force some change in government thinking, especially in the use of violence by employers to beat the hell (at least), out of "dissident" workers who had the adaucity to ask for "more".</p>

<p>Judge Brown's ruling has effectively given 38,000 BC teachers an IWW membership card.</p>

<p>What can a Wobbly do? Well just about anything he or she wants as long as he or she is prepared for the response. </p>

<p>While Judge Brown didn't include any Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free cards, 38,000 teachers dissenting as individuals have the best protection there is from going to jail.</p>

<p>Short of internment camps there is no way individuals can be arrested and jailed.</p>

<p>If thousands of other BCers were to join their individual teacher friends in a real and prolonged defiance of "officialdom" the wheels of commerce, public services and a whole lot more would quickly grind to a halt.</p>

<p>Pie-in-the-sky? I don't think so. Virtually every advance in human rights anywhere in this world has been accomplished by defying those who want to keep you down.</p>

<p>One of the few hurdles to this, if people are committed, might actually be some of the existing unions ironically, just as it was in the '20s, '30s, 40s and beyond.</p>

<p>   <br />
The one lesson from all of this is: a union is the people who opt to sign on and participate in the closest form of democracy available to them.</p>

<p> It is not office towers, negotiating teams, labour lawyers or any of the other trappings gathered to assist and advance the needs of the union.</p>

<p>Courts can't really take a union away any more than it can take a belief away. It can smash a union's capital infrastructure, but in doing so it is only smashing anation's  infrastructure and pissing off people who remain organized and committed to their cause.</p>

<p>And the great thing about such organizing is you aren't limited to a craft or trade jurisdiction. The membership can include anyone of like mind and commitment.</p>

<p>I agree with Coyoteâ€™s in depth post, a formidable task indeed to change the social order. It needs to be an organized enterprise coming from a grassroots movement, perhaps the nucleus of a new political party? That would be a difficult and time-consuming task, but very necessary.</p>

<p> However, great for the long term, but for the short term the dingdong DeJong and Quirly Shirley along with Campbull and the rest of the fibs could easily solve the immediate crisis if they came out of their ego bubble and actually met with the BCTF. All they would have to do is offer 0 wage increase for year 1, perhaps even 0 for year 2 and something decent for year 3, along with some small classroom concessions in terms of size and specialist help, and we avoid the next phase which could be very ugly. But, they wonâ€™t do that because they are bent on destroying the BCTF and the union, which is what their real agenda is. If the BCTF goes down, its hoop Ville folks.</p>

<p>THREE CHEERS FOR THE TEACHERS</p>

<p>On October 13th the teachers of Guatemala and Mexico held protest rallies at their Canadian embassies.  The teachers of South Africa have sent their support and expressed outrage at BC Liberal actions.</p>

<p>Parents and students are bringing food, coffee, etc and are joining the lines.  Parents are adopting teachers.  Retired teachers are offering support and time.  At last count, the trustees of 18 school districts have sent in letters of support for the teachers!!  Districts have been expected to provide new programs and keep pace with world education standards, while having funds constantly cut.  Some have had to resort to 4-day weeks, cutting instructional weeks from the school year, dropping courses, providing new mandatory courses without textbooks, etc.</p>

<p>The amount of support evident in this community is staggering.  </p>

<p>The court ruling only stops the BCTF from communicating with its members re the work action.  We can ALL talk to anyone we like, lend people our facilities, our money, give them food, encouragement and time.  An interesting side-effect of this court ruling is that it is now  easy to see who runs the BCTF ... its members.  </p>

<p>It's up to B.C. people to stop B.C. from joining the world's exploited and oppressed.  It's a sad day when Canadians are in need of world-wide compassion.</p>

<p>Right on Luceo, the teachers are the BCTF and they do need to show the world they can stand up and fight even if their head has been severed. Essentially, the court ruling has put the BCTF membership underground. Scary, but didn't a similar scenario play out in Nazi Germany? The individual teachers are really pissed this time and are not going down without a vicious battle. Good on them!</p>

<p>Martin, maybe I am wrong, about the College. I don't know, and I wouldn't want to risk having that kind of behaviour to test it. I don't think my community would stand to have me teaching their high school or middle school students.  They would be all over the school board. So, I would have triple jepardy: the laws of the province, the rules of my school district and the College to contend with.  </p>

<p>I don't believe that a teacher is allowed as much freedom to act unprofessionally as many legislators have.  I can be fired with cause if I lie to my principal or other administrator; if I make false and inflamatory statements to the public or my students, I would also face discipline.  Bearing false witness does not seem to be a problem for the premiere.  His bosses, the electorate, seem to hold him unaccountable for his continual lying and promise-breaking.</p>

<p>Answer to GW North, here's what the Honolulu Star-Bulletin said about the incident and the penalty.</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">LAHAINA &gt;&gt; After drinking three martinis and some wine, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell drove erratically on Maui, speeding and nearly crossing into a lane toward another vehicle.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>Campbell pleaded no contest yesterday to drunken driving and three other offenses.</p>

<p>As a first-time offender, Campbell was fined $500 for the petty misdemeanor of driving under the influence of alcohol. He also was ordered to pay $50 for failure to drive on the right side of the road, $50 for disregarding lane markings and $125 for speeding, going 70 mph in a 45-mph zone.</p>

<p>Campbell, who has publicly apologized for his behavior, did not appear in court, but was represented by Honolulu attorneys Steven Barta and Philip Lowenthal.</p>

<p>District Judge Reinette Cooper did not require Campbell to undergo 14 hours of alcohol abuse counseling and a substance abuse assessment, since he fulfilled the requirements before his court hearing.</p>

<p>Cooper said based on an assessment, she was satisfied Campbell required no further counseling.</p>

<p>"I do not believe there are aggravating circumstances," Cooper said.</p>

<p>She said she felt Campbell had been sufficiently embarrassed in the public, "as well he should be."</p>

<p>Barta said Campbell immediately accepted responsibility and has accepted a harsher penalty than usual.</p>

<p>Barta said usually, first-time drunken-driving offenders have lesser offenses dismissed, but Campbell decided to plead no contest to all of them.</p>

<p>Barta said Campbell's license was suspended for 90 days in Hawaii immediately after he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and that Campbell has continued to observe the suspension while in Canada.</p>

<p>Scrape and kick as hard as I could, the something just clung there like yesterday's garbage.</p>

<p>Finally, in frustration, I lifted my foot, caught the lower fence rail and dragged my foot back as hard and quickly as I could. </p>

<p>I heard something splatter on the wet ground below.</p>

<p>I looked at my newly clean heel and then glanced down under the fence and there in the midst of the rest of the manure laid a still steaming Martin looking very much the shape of a real heel.</p>

<p>It's time folks to finally hammer the last few nails in the Liberal coffin.</p>

<p>Someone please post which corporations made large corporate donations to the Liberal re-election machine so the working people of this province can choose wisely where they want to spend their strike pay, and make these corporates know that we will be boycotting them until they no longer assosciate with this awful gov't</p>

<p>And now is the time to call your local MLA and insist they rescind Bill 12 or you will be looking into recall legislation especially where Liberals barely won their area (like Gordo, Harry Blow, and Horny Lorne Mayercourt)</p>

                                <h3>I did my teaching practicum in Sooke B.C. and, as a result</h3>
<p>I did my teaching practicum in Sooke B.C. and, as a result of my exposure to the BCTF, could not get to Alberta fast enough.  I must get one thing straight before I continue - my practicum, from my school placement to my sponser teachers, was an incredibly positive experience that I will always value.  I was lucky enough to be placed on the TOC list immediately following my student teaching stint and was offered a job within my practicum school (which I declined). </p>

<p>In the Uvic Post Professional Program, I noticed that many of my fellow students possessed a lack of tolerance for any other viewpoint than that of the left leaning BCTF supporter.  One Professor was taken to task by several potential student teachers for trying to present a balanced (and by balanced I do mean an attempt to present both sides of an issue) perspective of the problems that exist in the BC public education system.</p>

<p>The last day of classes (Dec 14, 2004), before we embarked on our practicums, we were treated to a lecture by the union head of District #62.  He told us many things that were pertinent to our future careers; he then began to extoll the virtues of the union by waving a tiny little pamphlet, that he said was the "pre-union" contract for teachers, and comparing it to a voluminous tome that was the current binding agreement (we were not given access to either of these documents).</p>

<p>  I asked the gentleman why Teachers On Call paid union dues, yet recieved no benefits and no seniority for teaching time unless they replaced the same teacher for a set number of consequetive days.  He said that that was how one rose up in the ranks of the teaching profession.  I then queried, "is it not the mandate of a union to protect all its members?" (not to mention that in a socialist paradise 'rising up the ranks' should be a dirty phrase).  He said that he didn't want to debate union politics, but, when pressed, he said that in their Christmas meeting (of 2004) they (the BCTF) were planning on addressing this issue. </p>

<p>Should not a union that has been in existance for 20 some years have dealt with this issue by now?  </p>

<p>I have since heard that the BCTF sued the Liberal government for slander over a comment made about the possibility of a strike!!  In March of 2004, during the union part of a staff meeting at my practicum school, a union official told teachers that if the Liberal government were re-elected there would be a strike.  How can this be a slanderous utterance? </p>

<p> I am not taking the position that the government is blameless, but in a culture in which the professionals in question have been inculcated with the belief that their government is an inherently evil beauracracy that must be overthrown how can there be anything but animosity?</p>

<p>Allan, absolutely excellent post, and using the old Wobblies as an analogy was just about perfect. It is how we need to begin to think. We are in a different kind of situation than the trade union movement has been in since the post WW2,and it calls for us to carry out a thorough re-thinking on our parts, about all the inter-related issues of how we organize, our choice of a strategy, and the tactics we use.</p>

<p>I agree with you, the old Wobblies, even the old original OBU (One Big Union) of the past, are experiences that need revisiting. Which doesn't mean we necessarily have to exactly duplicate them, though we might, but more, learn from them, take from them what might be useful, and adapt them to our particular circumstances and time.</p>

<p>A period of creative thinking and strategizing, along with this experience of the teacher's strike, as Bailey pointed to in his also excellent piece, is what we need going forward from here. </p>

<p>We are in an evolving class war, <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> of our own creation, and we need to hunker down and get serious about fighting it, likely over an extended period.</p>

<p>There is much good "free" thinking going on here, from Gimpy, Sharing Is Good and many, many others.</p>

<p>Victory to the teachers and all of us.</p>

<p>Good post but I disagree with your comment that "We are in an evolving class war".  I believe we are in an age old class war of the <span style="font-weight:bold">haves</span> against the <span style="font-weight:bold">have nots</span>.  This is a conflict that has been going on since before the feudal ages.  They (the ruling class) have always viewed their relationship with the working class a one of slave and master.  This is apparent within union and non-nuion workplaces.  After 40 years of dealing with these people through all kinds of labour relation problems (strikes, wage negotiations, disiplinary hearings etc at least it is apparent to me.</p>

<p>Teachers, here's an excerpt from Friday Oct. 7, 2005 Hansard.  It has not been altered in any way, tempting as that might be!<br />
______________________________________</p>

<p>J. Horgan: As we get to section 2, I have some difficulty with some language right off the top inasmuch as the title of the section says "Constitution of teachers' collective agreement." Yet teachers weren't party to this agreement beyond being named in the act. They weren't here collectively. They didn't agree. So how could that be the heading for the section?</p>

<p>           Hon. M. de Jong: We have benefited from some four or five â€” depending on how we count them â€” days of debate, and I think it is abundantly clear to all that this agreement is provided for statutorily. It is not one that was arrived at through the free collective bargaining process. Nonetheless, the convention in terms of, again, the drafting of these pieces of legislation is to refer to it as such.</p>

<p>           J. Horgan: I could suggest other language, like the "imposed agreement" act or the "brought down without consultation" act.</p>

<p>Later on the same page (the .... dots indicate that I have left out a section):</p>

<p>Hon. M. de Jong:<br />
......  The member has, during the course of the second reading debate and again now, effectively and skilfully, I think, made his point that this is not a collective agreement of the sort that we generally consider or want to see emerge from a freely negotiated process. It is an imposed agreement, imposed by this Legislature. <br />

<p>wobblies, OBU? wow, this really is just plain over the top. how would we be reacting if, say, the police, or the fire department (those truly 'essential' services) had been on strike for the past five days? (begs a question - why DON'T they ever go on strike, anyway?)<br />
after our houses had burnt and stores looted, would we not be a bit weary of the so-called 'class struggle'?<br />
we aren't even CLOSE to class struggle, or the days of solidarity forever. sinclair stopped short of calling for a 'general strike' and said that 'essential services' such as BC Ferries, 'patient care and services for the disabled' (can someone enlighten me as the the 'essentialness' of these services?<br />
 i would suggest that one major user of BC Ferries on weekdays is, in fact, the commercial trucking industry. why the hell not shut the Ferries down? would the good Teamsters brothers be siding with the teachers and the BC Fed? have they even been asked? and, harkening back to the 80s - what about the cops, the firefighters, etc? <br />
because it's a teacher's strike, that's why. and we're seeing, now, that by playing footsie with the BC Fed, we're finding out that, no, it's actually NOT about the students, it's about (surprise) politics. <br />
i'd like to see a few new subjects in the BC schools curriculum. a curriculum based on the 'real world.' things like 'starting and running your own business.' 'responsible financial management, 101' (maybe a good course before secondary students attend university or college). 'working in a non-unionized environment - the pleasures of year-end bonuses, profit-sharing, and stock options.' <br />
now, i know that most idealogues HATE the real world and all that it entails, and are 'waiting for the Big Day' when workers unshackle their chains, not ulike Xtian Evangelicals waiting for the Great Flood. (uh, gee, that actually happened, didn't it??) <br />
the guys in those old photos of the Winnipeg General Strike don't look much like the well-dressed teachers in the class room or on the picket line. and i really don't think they'd be supporting their struggle, either...<br />
next wednesday, i suggest that our pollster take another phone poll and see how sentiment changes. as a woman told me today in the parking lot (and, folks, i DID NOT bait her) 'i wonder how much longer parents are going to shut up. i kinda guess we have to.'</p>

<p>If anyone wants to know what this entire dispute is all about, take a look at the most recent Saint Jinny video on the BCTF website.</p>

<p>Saint Jinny continues with her big act.  Today's installment "This weekend is a window" features Jinny standing in the dark, and the only visible thing are a bouquet of flowers she is holding, sent to her by her well wishers in the red guard, no doubt.</p>

<p>This new cult of personality seems to be enveloping all those around her.  She's taking the BCTF down the road to doom and no one inside is trying to stop her.</p>

<p>Martin:</p>

<p>Teachers are held to a much higher standard of behaviour than premiers.  I, personally, know two teachers in one district who have lost their jobs due to excess use of alcohol.  Neither of them caused public disorder, was convicted of any offense, including driving under the influence, or brought alcohol onto school district property.  Neither of them will ever work in the B.C. public school system again.  No jesting there.</p>

<p>Also a district superintendent caught some years ago with her hands in the till, lost her licence through the College of Teachers.  Educators can't behave like politicians ... with apologies to all you honest, hard-working politicians, wherever you are.</p>

<p>Note to sthrendyle:  (I'd use the quote thing if I could figure it out.)  You say, "it's actually NOT about the students, it's about (surprise) politics."</p>

<p>Schools and other public institutions have always been about politics. Teaching is a political act. Like Paulo Freire once wrote, "There is no such thing as a neutral education process". And further, I would say, there is no such thing as political neutrality. The books we use (or don't use) in schools are a "political" choice. The information we include (or leave out) is political. The policies, teaching style, and management of a classroom are choices based on the polical - and human - perspectives we carry around with us. Individual teachers represent individual perspectives which cover the entire political spectrum, but many of us - having been led into what we consider to be a helping profession - are at least humanitarian.</p>

<p>We BCTF members have always thought of ourselves as a "social justice union". Does that make us leftists? Only if justice is an exlusively leftist ideal.</p>

<p>Mr. DeJong get a move on. It is 4:30 on Saturday and I would like my kids back in school Monday.  Get the bargaining going now. Do not waste this last chance. </p>

<p>Only tonight and Sunday left then it is impossible for the you to bargain because those teachers are not going to go back without a negotiated contract and Gordo won't let you talk with them if they are not in school.</p>

<p>GWNorth: in answer to your enquiry about how Gordo has paid his pennance... simply... he hasn't. He and his band of morons, in complicity with the media in the province hit the people of BC with enough whitewash over his drunk driving affair (affair in more ways than one I might add... lol) to thoroughly convince the sheep that the premier was truly sorry for what he had done and paid his debt to society by holding a teaful news conference. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A CONVICTED CRIMINAL PICKS HIS OWN SENTENCE</span></p>

<p>should have been the headline of the story in the Canworst Gliberal newspapers.</p>

<p>Yet the people of this province, blinded by whitewash and seduced by Campbell's bathwater and bullsh#t, gave him and his bunch of idiots another term in office. Granted, they turfed 30 odd of his collegues, but do you think he knows the difference???? No way. He's still governing like the dictatorial thug he is. Never mind shutting Victoria down for a day of protest, they should shut the entire province down. </p>

<p>People aren't willing to put up with a heavy handed bunch of idiots like the Fiberals gutting the collective agreement process. It's not the bargaining relationship that's broken between the BCTF and the BCPSEA, its the BCPSEA that's screwed up.. period.  They don't negotiate, they only negotiate to a stalemate or to force government's hand to legislate a deal.  The entire mob should be fired on the spot for gross incompetence.  And parents... if you're thinking about joining the class action lawsuit against the BCTF, I wouldn't.  Save your pennies because probably alot of you are getting ready to hit the bricks as members of other unions being held hostage by the Campbell Fiberals.</p>

<p>Count on your kids being out of school for a few more weeks.  These idiot Fiberals are too arrogant, too stupid to see any opportunity given to them to resolve the quagmire they've placed themselves and the parents and students of this province in.  Mike deJong can only see where his next meal is coming from, that's how far sighted and outside the box thinking wise he really is.</p>

<p>It's funny that Sinclair hasn't consulted with ALL unions in this province, affiliated and unaffiliated, and come up with a true plan of escalation, up to and including a general strike.  That way when he does speak, he speaks with a unified voice. I can say with some confidence that right now... he doesn't.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">sthrendyle,</span> firefighters and cops have gone on strike in numerous Canadian jurisdiction when conditions and petty politicians have backed them up far enough.</p>

<p>And speaking of the Winnipeg General Strike, which I suspect some of your ancestors likely took part in on the side of the goons and employers, I am glad you raised it.</p>

<p>That strike was mirrored by a similar strike in Seattle and a great many other North American cities as the ending of the so-called great war showed returning troops how the ruling classes had been leaching off everyone as their comrads died in the trenches.</p>

<p>Bloated and over-confident, the employer classes, with their jackbooted police goons at their side intended to set an example for other workers who might ask for more.</p>

<p>But these paragons of virtue misread the returning troops who quickly read the tea leaves and realized the fascism they had defeated overseas has taken root in their own home towns while they had been away.</p>

<p>Police on horseback, weapons drawn, charged into a march by veterans and workers, breaking heads and bodies in one of the most viscious and ugly scenes ever played out on Canadian soil.</p>

<p>The Winnipeg Police Riots and General Strike was initially seen as a great victory for the guys who stayed home from the war and made big fortunes while others died for them.</p>

<p>However, 86 years later that incident is seen as a defining moment in Canadian labour history, a victory for working people who managed to organize and mobilize in Winnipeg like no where else before.</p>

<p>Oh, BTW Sthredlye, the real reason you don't see police and firefighters on the picket lines very often is if a negotiated contract cannot be worked out the employer has little choice but to go to binding arbitration.</p>

<p>There are two reason this government didn't offer the teachers binding arbitration.</p>

<p> The first is because Gordon Campbell's Liberals don't believe education for children is essential, unless it's in a private school that gets public funding.</p>

<p> The second is that government has it's collective head so far ups its own ideological arse, scheming to bust a class enemy that it can't keep it's story straight.</p>

<p>Go to a library and pull up copies of the Manitoba Free Press from the time of that 1919 event.</p>

<p>I can almost guarantee that when reading it you'll have to turn back to the front page to be sure you aren't reading a current Canwest newspaper. </p>

<p>The inflamitory rhetoric passed off as news almost a century ago is alive and well and, ironically, being directed today from an office in Winnipeg.</p>

<p>highland: obviously you are not in possession of all the facts in this issue.The government has forced this civil disobedience on the teachers. Now the government spin doctors are trying desperately to call it a strike so Gordo can say "see I told you so".As far as your lack of protection goes, in the private sector their is a labour ruling that new employees must work a probationary period (I beleive it is thirty days) before they can be covered by the contract. Yet I am unaware of any union in this country (except the rat unions) who will not cover a employee. And in 40 years in unions I have yet to see a local not cover a non union employee for injustices.</p>

<p>THis is an interesting article bout the teacher's strike which isn't a strike, but a corporate attack on our education system. I'm not familar with the site so I'm going back to look around.</p>

<p>I like the line that says something like, 'Campbell is a nobody who is making the actions of many 'illegal'.</p>

<p>9 hours = 13 ideas</p>

<p>Thanks to Name, Cuinn and Te Aro Arahina.</p>

<p>Note, two of these submissions it seems are from teachers. </p>

<p>I'm still waiting for postings from other non-teaching commentators.</p>

<p>Please outline what you are doing to make a difference. Again, I'd like to see this become a forum for action. What can be done in addition to discussion? Coyote? Allan? Martin? Inspector? SharingisGood? GWNorth? Luceo? Skepticool? Jacked?  </p>

<p>Let other bloggers know what you are planning to do.</p>

<p>1. Work collectively to approach financial institutions in the event of the denial of lines of credit or foreclosures.<br />
2. Collectively includes reaching out to non-union supporters to "chip in". To what or how this might be organized is still not clear but we're on our way.<br />
3. An appeal to local area residents and business owners to chip in. Good. An appeal by whom and how. Let's put some wheels on these.<br />
4. Great. Impromptu demonstations by students.<br />
5. Phone potential support on PAC (Parent Advisory Committee) and in the public. Give them at least one idea, such as writing letters/emailing/phoning to enourage a meeting. Or walking the line with us. Get THEIR phone trees started up.<br />
6.We can ask our school PACs to support and promote such efforts -- writing letters and organizing demonstrations of support on the picket lines (and I was not implying that all PACs were useless in my post above -- the key problem is BCCPAC's leadership or lack thereof --"SharingIsGood", your description fit to a T!). <br />
7.We can ask PACs and DPACs to pressure BCCPAC to take a stand as many of the school boards have done.<br />
8. We can ask the school boards that have not yet spoken up denouncing Bill 12 to do so.<br />
9.School trustees are facing re-election: we can ask sitting trustees and school board candidates to speak up re rescinding Bill 12 and urging government to meet with the teachers.<br />
10.Employers must be feeling the pinch of employee parents who are hamstrung by the strike, and the prospect of broader labour action -- encourage them to start putting pressure on the province.<br />
11. The Liberals will be polling quietly and monitoring the drift of letters published in local papers to gauge the public mood -- so keep sending letters to the papers.<br />
12. We should copy letters and e-mails to the Opposition Education critic (Jim Horgan?), as the Legislature will be sitting again next week.<br />
13.Parents can also network to support each other with child care, as the practical aspects are important to maintaining support if we're in for the long haul.</p>

<p>Clarity of purpose is important; it's time for principled action.</p>

<p>Class struggle, revolution, defiance of the law, capitalism is bad, anarchy, activism against the establishement. </p>

<p>My what bellicose statements! To what end?<br />
The glorification of the peon, the mounting of the proletariat on a monument base! The communification of society? The destruction of those who have the funds to create jobs?</p>

<p>Is that what most of you are suggesting? Are you planning to take us back to the feudalistic era where survival of the fittest is prime, or the sword is mighter than the logic of progression? Law created by the minority of vocal?</p>

<p>This is not a good governance method. The eventual end is chaos, distemper amonst those once allied. </p>

<p>Collectivism does not work. Unionism which is collectivism does not work except to hijack the wishes of the majority.</p>

<p>Rights. The right to work to advance in ones vocation is not predicated on simple senority but rather merit and the demonstration of contribution to society. Neuterality in things like education, health care delivery is paramount.</p>

<p>Has unionism become a blind religion to benefit a few as opposed to the greater good? It seems so. </p>

<p>The current labour action by teachers is not justified. the BCTF is trying to intern itself as the prime expert in education withour acknowledgement of other primary players. The BCTF is the test case. If they win, then society will suffer through partition. The BCTF will destroy public education through extortion and other illegal means. That is now crystal clear. </p>

<p>The BCTF does not care about anyone other than themselves as the solution provider. </p>

<p>Well none of the above are a good thing, but rather demonstrates a call to war against those who want to destroy our society.</p>

<p>Organized labour now shows their devious plan of blackmail, of disrepect of the majority, of revolution for a cause that has been and is flawed. </p>

<p>Yes time for war, time to destroy the public service unions who think they are worth more than the general public that pays their salary. </p>

<p>After all, those in the public service are 'servants' and that must not be forgotten! They exist on the approval of the greater public. Unions are trying to eliminate that democratic right.</p>

<p>War, I like the ring! Clearly the left has no other objective!</p>

<p>It is absolutely fantastic the support I've been seeing out here for the teachers and their union. People are putting signs up in their windows and storefronts which read, "We love our teachers!" and "Strike support here!" </p>

<p>The energy is overwhelmingly positive and really caring---glowing! It's easy to see why the government is reacting so fearfully and heavily because they are completely ineffectual here. There is such a terrific wave of popular support. Someone even nailed up a sign supporting the strikers on the provincial courthouse door, where over half the city and outlying areas drive past! It stood out like the Edict of Wittenburg.</p>

<p>A feudal society is exactly what we would like to <span style="font-weight:bold">avoid</span>, soylent. A ruling class of rich lording over and legislating against the rights of the majority. Which is how it has been progressing - lords (corporate elite) and their vassals (toadying lackey government flunkies) seeking to render the vast majority (us serfs) completely unempowered, marginalized, and unable to better our lot in life. To bargain collectively is not a symptom of communism; indeed, you'd be hard-pressed to find workers organized in Cuba. And the term "public servant" - including those who are our police, firefighters, and teachers does not imply (nor entail) a servile attitude. The long and difficult struggle to achieve decent wages and working conditions cannot be dismissed by your feeble rhetoric. Your characterization of unions: <div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">their devious plan of blackmail, of disrepect of the majority, of revolution for a cause that has been and is flawed.</blockquote></div><br />
is flawed in itself, and shows a lack of basic knowledge regarding the raison d'etre of unionism. Laws enacted to sabotage the very fundamental principles inherent in organized labour should be held up to the light and examined for what they really represent. A strategy to impoverish us all, morally, financially, and spiritually. Far from an attempt to "destroy society", as you rather ham-fistedly type, this struggle is to <span style="font-weight:bold">retain</span> the values that make our society just and fair. Your spittle-flecked ranting serves only to undermine the neoconservative agenda. Thank you.</p>

<p>A couple of things to share.</p>

<p>I heard Mike DeJong was in The Province Editorial Board yesterday. So do what I do if you want to read it. Go to your local coffee shop and read it without buying it.</p>

<p>And the other one is that the Liberals were hunkered down earlier today. A little bit of lip reading - Wally Opal on the phone - indicates that the Libs might be close to passing an olive branch.</p>

<p>It would be the smart thing to do.</p>

<p>War?  Come on SD don't be so melodramatic.  Do you really think that meek, mild, school teachers are such a threat that you would unleash a war on them?  </p>

<p>The governments of Cambodia and Argentina and El Salvadore went to war and killed their teachers and religious leaders (another form of teacher.)  Is that what you would like to see in B.C.?  Really?  Death squads and a government that rules with the gun? How about some mass graves full of teachers and clergy?  That ought to improve things in B.C. schools and keep the peasants in their place.<br />
 <br />
As for public servants, do you not think that the people we elect to serve us are public servants? Or that they have forgotten that honesty, integrity and sobriety are requirments of the high trust we place in them?  Last time I checked, Gordo worked for the people of B.C. not the other way round. If any public servant thinks he is worth more than the general public that pays his salary, it has to be Gordo. </p>

<p>We, the public, pay his wages and most of us believe that he needs to bargain in good faith with the teachers and get our kids back into school instead of resorting to the tactics of a bully.  Liberal arrogance has caused this mess and continues to escalate it.</p>

<p>Mr. DeJong needs to take the moral high ground now and get the BCTF to the table for some serious bargaining.  If that does not happen I fear for what lies ahead.  </p>

<p>Tick tick tick...time is running out.  </p>

<p>Get to the table and bargain Mr. DeJong. You have wasted Saturday.  Only Sunday left now before it all starts to fall apart. Only you can stop this madness.</p>

<p>Ah yes, the union tenant raison d' entre, what gibberish. A classic demonstration of propaganda, translated' how to make innovation into a drone. My god man have you been brain washed.</p>

<p>Unions do not believe in innovation, do not believe in anything that might create change. Let us just drone along. Kill those that have ideas and progress beyond their senority level. Those who show leadership, give them the brain wash treatment to continue the Triad.</p>

<p>Freedom of thought, of progression, of innovation, of the just and fair is discouraged in a union environment. The socalled senority principle is a clear testimony to that union failure. </p>

<p>Get with it, Unionism is a facade of fools without logic, without any sense of position in life, a land of whiners.</p>

<p>I know, Peter, isn't it terrific? Some close friends of ours have an organic farm. They are packing the back of their truck with fresh-picked fruits, vegetables and free-ranged eggs, to bring them to the picket lines on Monday so strikers can choose whatever they want. </p>

<p>No rotten tomatoes, but it's not like they are picketing in front of the legislature! ;-)</p>

<p>Thanks Dave A. </p>

<p>12 hours 20 minutes = 13 ideas for action; 1 concrete act.</p>

<p>102 postings.</p>

<p>Once again, I urge readers and commentators to take up the challenge. This forum could be a powerful tool for political organizing and action.</p>

<p>What are you willing to do or what have you done? (See my last posting for a summary of the suggestions provided by 3 people.)</p>

<p>Clarity of purpose is important; it's time for principled action.</p>

<p>Dalman says that in collective bargaining with police they do not bargain about residents per cop. Therefore, in teachers collective bargaining they also should not be allowed to bargain about students per teacher!</p>

<p>Hey with spin with like, if this guy is not working for the Liberal Party, he should be!</p>

<p>Seems to be an argument for why the police ought to be able to bargain about citizens/officer. </p>

<p>And what about organized crime? I mean, if you get a rise in residents involved in organized crime, lets say Liberal Party organizers trafficking marajuana for Party memberships, doesn't that change working conditions and should lead to more officers hired?</p>

<p>Coyote and Redriver Girl</p>

<p>Ah but you are wrong! The gibberish of far left wing throbs a reaction of the center. While the question of where the centre is can be debated at length, such is certainly not on the far right.</p>

<p>Red, your comment on rights is a little cloudy. No union has the right to tell me on how my children are to be taught, period. The BCTF is trying to do that. They do not understand that there is much more folks involved here. The BCTF does not represent the parents. Education is not a negotiable.</p>

<p>Coyote, well certainly you do represent the very far left wing, in fact Not even certain we have come up with a political definition for your position as yet! Certainly there is no give in take with you!!! lol</p>

<p>sdgreen, do you really think the public doesnt' see that Campbell etal believe in what GWB believes in? Do you think we don't know that now? Most of us do. That is why there is a lot of public support for the unions right now. Most of us saw Norma Rae.  And, I can hardly wait to see the new Murrow film. Maybe that'll give the press some courage.

<p>Thanks for your posts and reminders Mr. Gimpy. Keep them coming.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be too worried about all the "good folks" posting here. We're all pitching in. The BC Professional Teachers Association has kicked off a $200,000 hardship fund. Many of us are stepping up with significant doe-ri-me where we can.</p>

<p>We're talking to folks, we're on the lines. Calling and writing talk shows, writing to the papers. Clicking on polls. We're talking to private sector unions. Theres lots going on. Its not all just blab here in a forum.</p>

<p>If I'm a teacher, I'm going to be pretty careful what I use this forum for. Its infested with rats.</p>

<p>I think the action announced by the Fed is appropriate for Monday. We'll see what might be needed later in the week. </p>

<p>It is very important that every working persons significant problem with this morally corrupt government does not interfere with the issue before us today. Namely the teachers dispute. This is a winning issue. We cannot allow folks to act-up and highjack the focus.</p>

<p>We seen some good folks from other unions lack of good judgement during the BCFMWU strike. It does not play well. This is something we can help with too.</p>

<p>God I love our teachers, they will have my respect and solidarity forever.</p>

<p>To all those who have taken the position that the law is the law and must be obeyed, and there is no excuse for disobeying it and being in contempt (aren't we all just) of court.  Could I ask you to respond to the following events in Poland several years ago.</p>

<p>Lech Walesa was a trade union leader who led an illegal strike against the communist government in Poland.  Let me repeat, Lech Walesa was a trade union leader and he led an illegal strike in Poland.</p>

<p>His actions, and those of his supporters who defied Polish law and the might of the Polish state, eventually led to the demise of the communist government and the establishment of a democratic socialist government in Poland.</p>

<p>If he had not broken the law Poland may well still be communist, and due to the domino effect causing so many eastern European states to change government, so might half of Europe still.  I would appreciate your comments, and please don't waffle.  Please give a straight answer.</p>

<p>Was Lech Walesa right to break the law? </p>

<p>Should Lech Walesa have submitted to the law and returned to work?</p>

<p>Would you prefer Poland to have remained communist.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that most of us write various MLAs and ministers to let them know what we want them to do for us--even though most of us see it as an exercise in futility since all evidence points to corporate croneyism. We also write to members of the opposition to bolster their resolve when they seem to waver. We write to other BC union leaders urging support for a general strike. We ask our friends and business associates to step forward with whatever they can provide. We correspond with groups like the IWW, musicians like Bruce Cockburn and Anne Feeney,  writers like George Monbiot, Sidney Blumenthal, Cintra Wilson. It's all an ongoing part of building community. There is a large groundswell of support backing you.</p>

<p>These two point above seem entirely appropriate to me. I have no <span style="font-style:italic">fundamental</span> disagreement with either of them.</p>

<p>There's no indication of it here, that I can see.</p>

<p>Are you concerned about something coming from here? LOL </p>

<p>Now, I ask you, who can disagree with that?</p>

<p>We are all in love.</p>

<p>As a teacher who has taught under Social Credit, NDP, and now Liberal regimes, it has become plain to me over the years that right wing/neo-conservative political parties do not want an educated population.  This includes any and all politicial parties who are in the the pockets of big business.  By breaking the teacher's union quite possibly financially and morally, Campbell would then have free rein over what happens in our classrooms.  His government has already implemented grade 10 exams which will help winnow out those children who do not do well in school for a vareity of reasons.  Prior to these exams, these children were passed but could go to easiers courses in grades 11 &amp; 12 (Sci &amp; Tech 11, Math 11A, Communications 11 &amp; 12) and still graduate.  There were a numnber of post secondary occcuations that offered further training if a student graduated with these courses. No longer.  Math 10, English 10, and Science 10 all HAVE to be passed.  If you don't, you will likely not graduate.  This means that you will now have an incomplete grade 10 education.  Burger flipping or pumping gas as a life long career?  Next, the government has given equal money to all private schools: the same funding as public schools.  Since these private schools can then refuse admission to students with learning problems, children whose parents do not have English as their first language, etc, etc., the public system then becomes a place for all those students who cannot get into the private system because of financial reasons or learning disabilites.  Then we have the media encourage organizations like the Fraser Institute's rating of schools.  Districts like mine then allow students to migrate to any school that gets a high Fraser Institute rating.  But mostly, they go to private schools.  Lastly, if the fees for all post secondary education institutions(remember, only 15% of all students leaving grade 12 go to university, mostly go to college or some other institution) is raised beyond the level what most students can afford, then the government will have created an underclass that only has enough education to do minor service jobs.  This group of people will then become a large majority with a grade 12 eduation, low job prospects working for companies that will pay low wages and no benefits.  If their job has not been sent overseas to take advantage of even cheaper labour. The government will have also created an elite educated class that will control the government and corporations.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Know any examples in BC or Canada?   As long as a population is uneduated, it will not ask the questions or challenge its leaders to improve their lot.  Remember Paolo Freire and South America.  Supporting the teachers and their strike is the moral thing to do.  Children missing a few days out of about 2600 days in their K-12 educational career is insignificant if the ultimate goal is get education out of the hands of the current neo-cons whose only concerns are themselves and their friends on Howe Street.</p>

<p>Ah Coyote, don't put any stock in officialdom and if any of that sounded the least bit threatening then, I just need to be more eloquent.;-)</p>

<p>I will admit I have been in and out of the Fed doors - on issues - for many years. Most have been less than the desired result. Have engaged in all kinds of campaigns, regional national and international. And some of them have been slightly less than legal, in the eyes of the law I suppose. I'm not sure when the statute of limitations runs its course.</p>

<p>All I was trying to get at is we are winning this. The media is digging hard for something rotten to say. We both know that. Thats what the publishers are directing the editors to find. So, I guess I'm just trying to highlight the need to respect the lines and those that are charged with lining them.</p>

<p>I was at a ferry terminal during the ferry workers strike. The news uplink trucks were there and the reporter was lining up in front of the camera to go live. We had some folks, who were there in support wanting to mug it up for the cameras. What do you think would play better in peoples living rooms, a reporter making outragous statements about a rowdy picket line and people yelling behind her or people just standing in the cold rainy December night?</p>

<p>General public support was against the ferry workers when that dispute started. When it was over the public was solidly behind them. Not because of the conduct on the line that December night but because of a range of factors. </p>

<p>And really all I was trying to do was give our fellow poster Mr. Gimpy a concrete act and share some experience. Not all of us have walked dozens of lines or engaged in acts of industrial leveraging.</p>

<p>Let's be entirely clear.</p>

<p>The object of all this, its raison d'tre, is <br />
to secure a victory for the teachers. Period.<br />
( And maybe polish off the rest of this bottle of scotch. :-)</p>

<p>But ehhh, if we do that, we also help establish a different political and winning dynamic, and precedent, in this province. Now, do we all get that?</p>

<p>A good start for the next phase of the struggle, when it arrives. And it will. You can set your historical clock by it. (All you students of history should know that.)</p>

<p>After that, it is a simple question of whether my analysis is correct or not. It is that blue-green solution bubbling away in the test tube there, centre stage in the lab. If we do this, how will it react? Hmmm. How, if we do that?</p>

<p>The object after that, after securing this victory for the teachers, in my view, is to keep moving society and socio-economic development forward, and prevent it from ever moving backward again, for the lifetime of my grandchildren. (After that, I'm bemusedly looking at it from the other side of the grass.)<br />
 <br />
Which is as far ahead as I can see into the future. After that, they are on their own again.</p>

<p>The trick is however, and people are forgetful critters, is to keep it moving forward, and not let it slide backwards. Backeard is the road to Extinction, which is the road Capitalism is on.</p>

<p>I am getting very worried that no solution to this situation seems to be in sight.  This is a serious posting.  No more jokes from here.  No political statements -- just a possible solution.</p>

<p>Could you all please give some serious consideration to this suggestion (in spite of where it comes from, in that I realize that my credibility is probably shot with most of you):</p>

<p>Would the teachers consider returning to work, IF the government agrees to a mediation of this dispute?  A team of independent third party mediators could be hired (like Vince Ready for example, but who are expert in the field of education).  Each side gets to appoint one mediator, they will work together.  Mediators must be neutral on these issues.</p>

<p>The mediation would not be binding, however this may provide a way out, a way to get the parties talking again.  But the teachers would have to agree to return to work, in exchange for the government agreeing to a formal mediation of these matters.  By now, the government would probably appreciate the opportunity to appear reasonable in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>(I have heard noises lately that teachers might be willing to let go of their demands for a salary increase, in exchange for the ability to negotiate class size and special needs funding.  This strikes me as entirely reasonable.  There may be hope yet.)</p>

<p>I believe that both sides have now realized that there needs to be a way out here. Otherwise, I am truly afraid that this will go on into November, and I know that NOBODY wants that to happen.  </p>

<p>Maybe we need to set aside the rhetoric, the posturing, for now, and get down to the business of finding a solution that does not involve either side being seen as backing down.</p>

<p>Does anybody else think that this is a good idea?</p>

<p>Oh, oh.... a new addiction.</p>

<p>Just looking over several hours worth of postings above and noting the language (adjectives in particular)and tactics. Those seemingly left of center use argument, patience, evidence, encouragement. They are articulate and well-informed. Those seemingly (obviously in a couple of cases) right of center use personal insults and attacks, repetition, opinion as "fact", and bluster.<br />
Coincidence maybe? But who would you rather run aground with and spend your days trying to survive together?</p>

<p>More evidence that the left is right and the right is wrong.</p>

<p>What the hell do people like nemesis and sdgreen do to celebrate a victory like Gordo's election together? Bash each other in the face till they're giddy? Are these the people our mothers told us to stay away from?</p>

<p>Actually the comparison with Lech Walesa and Solidarity isn't that bad.  Much closer than the one with Rosa Parks.  The difference being that Lech was standing up to a federal, not a provincial, government and therefore Oliver Campbell has much less in the way of coercive tools at his disposal.</p>

<p>sdgreen, you have little or no knowledge of history.  I read your last couple of posts and wonder if your education consisted of a quick reading of "Chronicle of the World".</p>

<p>For god's sake man, trotting out that tired old view that the rich employ the poor out of a sense of moral obligation?  Where do they teach this stuff?  Private school?  I hate to tell ya but unions are not a throwback to the days of feudalism.  Back then your loving rich had all the money too and I'm sure there must have been peasants like yourself claiming that their overthrow would mean the collapse of society.  But the destruction of feudalism actually improved things for most of us don't you think?</p>

<p>Geez, some of you guys on the right must be in tune with the history of some other planet because it sure isn't this one.</p>

<p>Chella,</p>

<p>I too have been wondering how this ends. Your scenario is akin to the one in my head - with some difference in terms of the degree of assurance needed regarding first two objectives (working and learning conditions; bargaining rights). I myself am willing to shelf salary for now in favour of the first two. And I think these are what our struggle is about for most...</p>

<p>A bit of insight for you...</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">But the teachers would have to agree to return to work, in exchange for the government agreeing to a formal mediation of these matters.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>This will never happen. The teachers wanted to negotiate before they walked, now the government all of a sudden wants to talk <span style="font-style:italic">if</span>they go back to work? Ya right.<br />
Ding Dong, errr I mean Dejong is a fool for requesting this.</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">I have heard noises lately that teachers might be willing to let go of their demands for a salary increase, in exchange for the ability to negotiate class size and special needs funding. This strikes me as entirely reasonable. There may be hope yet.)<br />
</blockquote></div></p>

<p>You just don't get it do you. The teachers are far more interested in the other issues of class sizes, special needs support and ESL issues.</p>

<p>Teachers care mostly about the betterment of our children and society; not their pocket books.</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">I believe that both sides have now realized that there needs to be a way out here. Otherwise, I am truly afraid that this will go on into November, and I know that NOBODY wants that to happen. </blockquote></div></p>

<p>This will not go into November because if Gordo does not talk to the BC Fed by tomorrow then this is going to start to escalate an quickly. By Wednesday when the whole province is out we will then see who will be the ones eating Gordo up.</p>

<p>That is all you are going to pry out of me.</p>

<p>The teachers are <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span></span>defying the law, they are rising against an unjust law.<br />
Surely a man of your experience knows the difference.</p>

<p>So are you the spokesperson now or are you just covering for De jong while he goes on holidays now that Gordo's back?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Keep it up teachers, you have us parents and the rest of the public behind you!</span></p>

Allan, re the Wobblies, I knew an old man who had been a Wobbly, and his personal story was of RCMP and their horses being brought in by train in the Thirties, whereupon they clubbed and drove striking coal miners off mine property and across the unfrozen Similklameen River in mid-winter. (At Coalmont near Princeton). We can read also of the brutality visited upon the striking miners at the mines near and in Nanaimo, owned by the Dunsmuir family.</p>

<p>Oor Credit Unions were set up in those times, as a fallback for working people unable to get loans from (and for some who were ruined by) the avaricious Banks. With the exception of many Vancouver area CUs such as VanCity, it appears many have forgotten and/or deny their <br />
their origins, looking now only at the Banker's "bottom line"</p>

<p>Thus, taking my cue from GW North, I'll be contacting <span style="text-decoration:underline">my</span> local CU, demanding they put up a sign saying "WE SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS" If that drives away some business, too bad, they were never intended to think like banks anyway.</p>

<p>Here I am, cuinn!!  :-)  </p>

<p>I have stayed away from here for a while for a number of reasons.  I have been busy but decided to focus on things more positive and in support of my colleagues directly.  I was frustrated by some of the comments on here (as some of you may have guessed by a few lengthy posts I made on another thread lol).  </p>

<p>Although very angry and frustrated by Justice Brown's decision initially, I now believe it has been a blessing in a way.  </p>

<p>Teachers are more determined and united than ever before.  I have heard my colleagues say they feel closer as a staff than ever before.  Our Principal tells us she misses us and is jealous when she can hear our laughter from the picket line.  We have been swamped with treats from parents, students, and other union members.  (Please, healthy snacks too!  Our waistbands are expanding lol).  We have taken to calling it the "picnic" line now lol.  People keep coming by to visit, drive by honking and waving and some parents are even going out of their way to drive by with their kids to show support.  </p>

<p>I have had numerous calls of supports from friends and family.  I've received care packages from friends and I know I'm not the only teacher this has happened to.  My divorce lawyer has even offered to return the retainer held in trust to help me cover bills!  (To be paid back at a later time, of course lol).  Today I was approached in a store by an elderly woman.  She asked if I was a teacher  and when I told her I was, she shook my hand and said, "Thank you so very much for everything you teachers are doing for the children."  Being the emotional sap I am, I started to cry and she gave me a hug.</p>

<p>If anyone thought that teachers could be silenced, they are so very wrong.  Communication and support shared amongst teachers will never be stopped.  Don't you think there are teachers out there who know how to set up blogs, etc. to enable us to continue supporting one another?  I've had a few calls from fellow teachers saying they are having problems accessing their school district email now.  I think it might be because they are accessing it through the internet as opposed to having downloaded the program directly.  Last time I checked I could still access the school district email but that was a while ago.  I have, however, forwarded some emails from my school district to home email and they have yet to go through.  Methinks the muzzling has begun but please don't think we can't figure out ways around it.  They can't shut me up on here either lolol.  I would think that all those that believed that the BCTF Exec. was telling us how think ... apology accepted.  We are united no matter what and still Jinny stands tall and makes us proud.</p>

<p>In my sublocal we experienced the good fortune of incredible timing.  An Octoberfest had been planned since Sept.  Teachers from my sublocal had a great time together and we certainly did not promote the strike whatsoever so remained in compliance with the court order lolol.  We sang "We're Not Gonna Take It" with gusto and made possibly a few too many toasts to our hero, Jinny Sims :-)</p>

<p>I believe that the approach taken by the BC Fed is the most correct and diplomatic approach.  Don't forget that teachers aren't usually the most militant bunch lol.  The window of opportunity is always left open for Gordo and his gang.</p>

Please do not insult the intelligence of teachers.</h3>
<p>Chella,</p>

<p>Please do not insult the intelligence of teachers.  Why should we believe your FIBerals when they've done nothing but lie since first coming into office?  Do you forget the promise Gordo made not to sell BC Rail?  I'm not going to believe or trust a government that ignores rulings from the UN and the Supreme Court of Canada when they go against them.  We had a good giggle on the picket line when we heard Gordo say (when referring to the softwood lumber dispute) "I prefer negotiations over litigation."  HYPOCRITE!!!!!!!!  What does he call Bill 12 then?????  Your suggestion for us to go back to school because Gordo makes us a promise makes me laugh. </p>

<p>Anyone who's done some background reading would know that teachers all over BC have sacrificed wage increases numerous times in order to achieve smaller class sizes and supports for students.  I am perfectly willing to do it again and I know I am not alone in that belief.  But such compromise was back in the day when our contracts were negotiated instead of imposed legislation.  I feel 100% safe in saying that IF the government or even BCPSEA had offered at least the beginnings of negotiation and compromise, we would not be in the situation we find ourselves in today.  You are blind if you think otherwise.  </p>

<p>Teachers are not a militant bunch but we are tired of running with our tail between our legs.  This job action is the result of frustration and continual bullying from the Liberals.  Let's not forget that we do not go back to school until the entire membership has been given the opportunity to vote on any decision first.  The majority of teachers will not trust the government as you suggest.  Sorry, but surely you can't blame us.</p>

<p>Spare me the amateur hour analysis Sir John A.    If you want to make a point you have to form it and then type it, I can't read your mind.  Pumping yourself up like a peacock and calling everyone within range a name and then tossing out your favourite word "blathering" gets more than a little boring to read.</p>

<p>"When democratically elected govt's pass legislation they are not defying the rule of law"</p>

<p>This obviously begs the response that you think a gov't has to be democratically elected in order not to be defying the rule of law.  Not true.  Lots of different gov'ts have passed laws and their courts have backed them up.  The gov't of Poland in the 80's passed laws too.  The Polish police and courts enforced those laws.</p>

<p>As for Lech, yes, he went out on a very long limb.  Solidarity could have ended up crushed like what happened to the Czechs in '68.  But the Soviet bloc of his time wasn't the one that existed in '68 or under Stalin.  Change was already occurring within it.  Except in the west where we were still being treated to military analysis telling us hundreds of Soviet Category II and III divisions were on a hair trigger and about to sweep to the Rhine.  That and Reagan's dumbed down view of the world.  However, once the wall crumbled we have come to know a lot more about what was going on there than we used to.</p>

<p>In the first go-around for Solidarity, workers were in fact crushed under martial law but rose again within a few years.  The second time around the gov't negotiated, the union was allowed and its political arm won actual elections.</p>

<p>As I said last post, the BC teachers aren't facing a federal gov't and there is no doubt T-62's aren't going to rumble down Robson Street, and certainly Oliver Campbell isn't going to start shooting teachers but when you look at the actual issues involved, a union demanding the right to exist, be heard and fairly bargain for its members there are similarities.</p>

<p>A major difference is that in Poland they were trying to create something, in BC we're trying not to lose something.</p>

<p>Unions existed under communism but they didn't really have any rights.  Its what many here see as the future of unions in BC.  Sure they'll exist on paper but they won't be allowed to bargain and they won't be allowed to go on strike.  In a future consisting of Campbell-as-premier its not only possible, but more than likely that a union in BC will have as much power as a gov't mandated union in pre-Solidarity Poland.  So legalistically, I do see a parallel.<br />
  </p>

<p>Again if you disagree don't act like Sam the Eagle from the Muppets and call everything an outrage, just respond with an argument of your own.</p>

Teachers are purchasing green ribbon and distributing it to the public who would like to display them on their vehicles to show support for the teachers.  The ribbon is purchased by individual teachers from their own funds.  We are hoping that this will become a province-wide show of support.  So go out and get some green ribbon please folks!!!</p>

<p>For Frank:</p>

<p>Excellent commentary, I can only hope to be so coherent.</p>

<p>I see the conflict with the teachers as only an extension or perhaps a symptom of the continuing decline of the socialist state.  </p>

<p>The problem with the teachers situation is that they are in a relative monopoly in public education.  Without the competition, whenever they strike the 'public' has no other option.  </p>

<p>Recent legislation (starting in the 1960's) that returned parents to the position of being able to teach their own children (thru the ending of truancy laws) has given some competition for the public system monopoly but still only for those who have the confidence to strike out alone, initially or in smaller groups such as parochial schools.  The homeschool movement was really the only alternative to the mass-production education system that the modern society has come up with.</p>

<p>What is needed is a competitive factor that will still allow the teachers want to have a union to do so, then for those who do not want a union, nor wish to comply with public-education system methods or administration they also will have an outlet for earning a living as a teacher.</p>

<p>What must be remembered here is that teaching is just a service industry, admittedly more goes into it than serving fries and a drink, but a service it is no less.  Without the competeitive pressures of an alternative there will never be a solution to this impasse.</p>

<p>Another complication with education industry is that learning, like love, is a gift not a comodity. To make a living from selling learning is like making a living from selling love...</p>

<p>RE: NDP involvement. </p>

<p>1. The NDP members tag-teamed all night to oppose Bill 12. Parliamentary procedure allowed each to speak 1/2-hour on the Bill; every NDP MLA did so. At the end of that time, Jenny Kwan moved an amendment to take it off the table for 6 months, allowing a face-saving exit for the Liberals. Each NDP MLA spoke her or his allotted 1/2 hour on that amendment. The Liberal majority quashed that amendment, preferring to continue &amp; escalate the conflict.</p>

<p>2. Scott Fraser, Qualicum-Alberni, said that those Liberals who actually attended (the minimum number necessary to ensure that the bill continued through the leg) SLEPT through the overnight debates. Clearly, they are not at all interested in hearing what the  Loyal Opposition has to say on the matter. Their ears - and minds - are closed.</p>

<p>3. New Democrat MLAs must speak with great care so as not to breach their oath of office, which requires them to uphold the laws of BC. Thus you will hear carefullly couched support for increased class size, return to bargaining in good faith, and so on. It is a delicate tightrope to walk, and they are doing a great job.</p>

<p>4. This is NOT, nor should it be, about the NDP, as someone noted above. It is about a government whose actions have breached international human rights standards, about a government who was found by our own Supreme Court to be in breach of the law, and a government which then made a new law to make their illegal actions legal. The lesson I take from this is that the Liberals believe it is acceptable for them to act in defiance of the law because they have the power. </p>

<p>The teachers' strike, truly, is about what kind of government we want in BC. And I, for one, am grateful to the teachers, to the BC Fed, and to the parents, students, concerned citizens who are making a public statement against the Liberal hypocrisy and bullying.</p>

<p>Isn't that strange?<br />
The "steeltoe" unions can negotiate agreements without that many strikes, while the Proffesional Associations(doctors, lawyers and teachers) and public sector unions have their contracts imposed by legislation.<br />
This isn't a left/right ideological thing with governments in this part of Canada but a sign of cowardice for eyeball to eyeball negotiation. Bullies(dictators) cannot be seen to lose face.  This is politically fatal.<br />

                                <h3>I'm glad to hear Wally Oppal is on the case.  He is a good</h3>
<p>I'm glad to hear Wally Oppal is on the case.  He is a good man -- smart, reasonable.  Mediation and binding arbitration are two different things, GMP. I spoke out of turn when I said Carole Taylor is the only reasonable person there -- I forgot about Oppal.</p>

<p>I don't belong to any political parties,  never have -- check it out if you like.  I am officially politically neutral.  I have had some negative personal experiences with unions, which have shaped me and formed my personal opinions.  Can we leave that aside for now? </p>

<p>Oppal and Campbell are two different people.  Forget Campbell for now.  Forget Christy Clark.  She played a huge part in souring relations.  She's gone now.  Bond is innocuous by comparison.  Let's try to make some progress here.</p>

<p>I have some experience as a mediator.  A mediation is designed to isolate the issues, identify the facts that can be agreed upon, and bring the parties closer together, with the ultimate goal of reaching settlement.  It is non-binding so that the parties can fully explore settlement possibilities (in arbitration the parties give evidence which is on the record).</p>

<p>The first step is an agreed-upon mutual statement of facts. Facts are non-emotional, non-political, non-opinionated. I propose the following facts.   </p>

<p>1.  The government legislated a 7% pay raise for teachers in 2002, but did not provide extra money to fund this raise.  This necessitated school boards making cuts to fund the raise.</p>

<p>2.  Since 2002, there have been about 30 bargaining sessions between the parties.  These all proved unsuccessful.  No agreement has been reached.</p>

<p>3.  The government recently legislated a contract to which the teachers did not agree.  The preamble to this legislation states that it is the product of collective bargaining.  It is not.</p>

<p>4.  In response, teachers voted some 90% to take job action.  Schools have been closed ever since.</p>

<p>5.  At issue are the cap on class sizes, funding for special needs students, and funding for ESL students.  Teachers also seek a 15% pay raise.</p>

<p>6.  There is a great deal of acrimony between the parties.  Relations have completely soured.  Emotions are running very high.</p>

<p>7.  The Labour Board has declared that this an illegal job action, given that education is an "essential service" in B.C.</p>

<p>8.  The government has stated that it will not sit down with or speak to teachers, unless they go back to work first.</p>

<p>9.  The teachers have stated that they will not go back to work, until the government sits down with them to talk first.</p>

<p>10.  We have reached a complete stalemate.</p>

<p>Can we agree on these facts?  Does anybody have any other essential FACTS to add?  If you agree, I could try and email Oppal with the list, and see if the government will agree that these are the facts.  </p>

<p>At least it is a first step.</p>

<p>I do not believe the government will simply cave in, even in the face of a general strike, because to do so would set a precedent that would make their future governance impossible.  "Escalation" is therefore not a realistic solution.  It isn't possible to accurately predict the reaction of the public to an escalation, so given this uncertainty, perhaps a rational approach might be better.</p>

<p>If anybody has any comments on this proposed agreed-upon statement of facts, please let me know.  Your lawyers would charge you for this service -- I won't</p>

<p>Murdock,<br />
A tantalizing post, calling education an industry and implicitly comparing teachers to whores. Youâ€™re right in there with the Liberal philosophy of the business model.</p>

<p>There may be a few errors with your argument. First, there have always been more alternatives to public schools than home schooling, namely private schools. Most people, for a variety of reasons, donâ€™t choose to take that alternative. Just because most people use Windows doesnâ€™t mean that the Mac isnâ€™t an alternative. So we already have competition in the education industry.</p>

<p>Second, the â€œeducation industryâ€ has been deemed important enough by society that everyone is required to participate in it from age 5 to 14, at least. Many would call education not just a service but a democratic right, since it is necessary in order for a citizen to participate actively in a democracy.</p>

<p>I am confused by your final statement, the one that implies that teaching is like being a prostitute. (Of course, Iâ€™m equating love with sex, a problem Iâ€™ve had since adolesence. Perhaps you had something more lofty in mind.) If learning is a gift, how can the education be a service industry?</p>

<p>Your points are correct up to Point #2.  The BCPSEA, the "employer", is really just a front for the government.  It had received its instructions from the government that it was not to bargain or agree with anything that was to be put on the bargaining table.  Teachers could have had 60 sessions instead of the 30, but it wouldn't have improved the situation.  How can the BCTF "negotiate" with a government/employer that does not want to negotiate but only impose its own dictatorial laws.</p>

<p>Chella,</p>

<p>#9.5 - The BC Federation of Labour has stated that if the government does not talk by Sunday October 16th that there will be a full scale protest by all union members and supporting public in Victoria. (Don't forget that important point)</p>

<p>You say, <div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">I do not believe the government will simply cave in, even in the face of a general strike</blockquote></div> </p>

<p>It is quite evident, up to this point in time, that they will not be reasonable and take this opportunity that was graciously offered by the BC Fed to find solutions to the issues.</p>

<p>If they will not back down in the "face" of a General Strike then we will see what they do once a General Strike is fully implemented provincially and rapidly spreading nationally in a couple of days.</p>

<p>Ed writes: "One other pertinant fact: The Labour movement believes that Bill 12 improperly removed a civil right (to bargain a collective agreement) from the Teachers union". Exactly. This is what this fight is about.  Let's keep this in mind: collective bargaining was once illegal - and attacks on unions in their early years similarly routed in rule of law arguments. The right was eventually won by civil disobedience. It is now considered a basic human right of workers internationally.  If it was worth fighting for (and it unquestionably was in my view), maybe its also worth defending - including by removing to submit to an outrageous law.</p>

<p>so good to see you back - you speak for all of us. thanks so much for bringing the story back to where it needs to be - we are talking about teachers here - people who love children and teach because they love the profession, definately not for the money! i will go out today and buy some green ribbon and hand them out on the ferry ride over to victoria tomorrow!  thanks to so many of you for your warm support - it really does help those of us who do NOT do this all the time.  i do so hope that someone in the government grows a brain soon, because i miss my class!</p>

<p>I've just read David Screck's blog. Usually, I think he's on the money but his take on the teacher's strike is increasingly bizarre. I wonder what he's up too? </p>

<p>After suggesting, essentially, that Jim Sinclair mediate along the lines suggested here by Chella, he concludes his commentary with an observation which suggests that the Gov has no reason to mediate:</p>

<p>"Ultimately the government will "win" and the teachers will be forced to return to work when the court bankrupts the union and, if necessary, imprisons its officers."</p>

<p>This is utter nonsense, in my view. A whole lot of things that are very unlikely have to happen before the BCTF is bankrupted by court order, and an even more improbable sequence of events would have to occur before the officers of the BCTF could possibly be jailed for criminal contempt of court. </p>

<p>But let's assume these things occured. 1. the BCTF, which is after all a federation of other associations- gets protection from its creditors. through banruptcy (unlikely) and 2. Jinny Sims and some other officers gets charged with something (unlikely), are denied bail pending that trial (unlikely in the extreme) and go to jail sometime in the future (very long odds). What possible impact would these possibilities have on the resolve of individuals teachers, and the associations that comprise the BCTF to carry on the fight? I can't see why it would lead to a collapse of resolve, to say the least. </p>

<p>And yet, mostly liberals but now also Schreck keep asserting over and over again that this is all going to end with jailed officers of the BCTF (forgetting that they are entitled to trials, which take ages and rarely end with jail sentences for anything like this) and a bankrupted BCTF (forgetting that bankruptcy would benefit the BCTF by protecting it from its creditors). The Government does not want to prosecute the Jinny Sims trial, and they hardly want to arrange for the orderly payment of BCTF debts by applying to court to bankrupt it!<br />
 <br />
David Schreck is being uncharacteristically superficial and might want to read up a bit before he advances the resistence is futile liberal spin.</p>

<p>A short article in the last BC Teacher says that the BC Liberals have the worst labour record in North America.  In a recent report, the International Labour Organization slammed the province for violating freedom of association principles.  This is the 9th time in two years the ILO has condemned Premier Campbell's government for trampling on the basic rights of workers, the worst record in North America.  Campbell now has the dubious honour of having had more ILO complaints filed against his government than any other Canadian province in the agency's 84 year history.</p>

<p>In a case like this the trial does not have to take very many minutes before people go to jail.</p>

<p>Bankrupting the union will not help the BCTF.  The courts would levy fines that either put a big dent in the BCTF's assets or clean them out entirely.  Whether the BCTF wants to then assign itself into bankruptcy to distribute what is left of the carcass among its creditors would probably be up to it.</p>

Learning is one</h3>
<p>Thank you for your response bloodnok.</p>

<p>Learning is one thing, education is another.</p>

<p>Learning is a lifelong process described by socrates as the gift of understanding.</p>

<p>Education is the enforcement of bureaucratic and seemingly arcane rules of 'knowing'.  Thus the enforced (albeit more loosely since the truancy laws are gone) schooling of youth in the prison-like atmosphere of modern industrial schools.</p>

<p>Learning is natural, education is an industry.</p>

<p>In response to the argument of private schools, they are only accessable to those whom can aford them in monetary terms, and homeschooling is only afforable to those with the time (as I know only too well with my own childrens' home schooling).  Thus for the great mass these options are possibly out of reach.</p>

<p>I personally would like to see a change in the methods and mindset that would allow homeschoolers to get their tax contribution back out of the system, I keep reading and hearing about numbers like $3000 to $5000 per year per student.  Give me the money (via some sort of voucher system) and let me [the parent whom has the legal responsibility for the child in our system] make the decisions I am supposed to have the responsibility to make.  </p>

<p>Then allow the education industry to stand or fall on its own.  If some teachers wish to organize and make a union or professional association then sell that to the voucher holders fine.  If others want to stand apart and run smaller classes (10 students at $3000/year is a $30,000/year salary - plus deductions as a self-employed individual is a pretty great remuneration) and NOT be dictated to by a system or government or anyone else other than the parent/child clients that they choose to have the allow that method to stand along side the unionized one also.</p>

<p>I agree that a learned society is one that will function well.  I disagree that the public school system we have now serves us as the only way to achieve that learned society.</p>

<p>I am most distressed that we seem incapable, as a society, to think differently.  If we do the same things as in the past we shold not expect any different outcome than in the past.</p>

<p>It's interesting how you've changed on your take of the teachers' job action, Chella.  It's nice to see that you are finally attempting to be proactive but you've already admitted that you lied once on another thread.  Hmmmm why should I (and my colleagues) trust you anymore than we trust the FIBerals?</p>

<p>I saw the story on Global TV last night, did you?  Did you hear the rumors that the FIBerals may be agreeing to FINALLY meet with the BCTF?  They are scrambling now.  They are losing face as the support for teachers grows.  </p>

<p>It appears as though there are some games being played with our school district email.  If they are trying to prevent teachers from communicating from one another, they are failing.  For some, it's rather simple to create a new web site, after all.</p>

<p>The teachers of BC will NOT give up until we have achieved our goals.  Teachers are more united every day that this goes on.  Although it helps, we don't need the BCTF Exec. to keep us unified, we are doing that all by ourselves.</p>

<p>We would be more than happy to NEGOTIATE with the government.  We will not go back until that happens.  We will win this for our students.</p>

<p>Joesmith323: when the BCTF considered an illegal strike, they obviously also considered the possibility of devasting fines and jail. They went out anyway. Why now would the possibility of devasting fines and jail lead them to collapse? It won't.</p>

<p>Also, the chances of fines leading to the permanent destruction of the BCTF, or the incarceration of officers for anything more than a night or two were always low. </p>

<p>I agree with you completely that the question of BCTF's bankruptcy would probably only arise on their motion, in all likelihood. I don't agree with your statement that " in a case like this the trial does not have to take very many minutes before people go to jail" if you mean jail for any significant length of time.  There are all sorts of technical reasons why the instant trial and contempt finding isn't possible here - but they really boil down to this: Campbell can't legislate away the Charter, and the officers are entitled to a trial, including the right to make full answer and defence.</p>

<p>Average Joe:  threats are not productive, nor useful.  Threats have been flung from both sides here, mind you.  I understand this.</p>

<p>Teachers, you need to be very careful that your dispute is not being used by other parties to further their own ends.  Let's keep to the real issues of this particular job action.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input.  The gov'ts declaration that education is an "essential service" needs to be litigated before the courts.  Perhaps that could be done another time?  Also, the "removal of rights" issue can also be litigated by way of a Charter challenge, i.e. the right of teachers in the future to be able to negotiate a collective agreement can be litigated down the road.  Civil disobedience on that issue might not be necessary, after all.  Human rights are important in Canada, and this provincial government is treading on very, very thin ice.  They need new leadership.</p>

<p>Dale:  your belief that the government instructed the employer to act in a certain manner is not a fact, it is an opinion.</p>

<p>As for David Schreck, maybe he is feeling inadequate at the present time, and over-compensating as a result.  Give the guy a break, does it really matter what he says in his blog?  I've said things I regret later, that's for sure.  All of that is besides the point.</p>

<p>So, other than you are wanting to add a couple of facts which I feel are not actually facts (one is an opinion about what the government did behind the scenes, another, the statement of a legal issue), may I take it that my statement of the chronology of facts is accurate?  </p>

<p>I guess I can't really go to Oppal with these "facts" as agreed by the teachers though, because I do not speak on your behalf.  That was just an idea.  But let's let calm, cool heads prevail here.  Take this, talk about it in person on Monday.  Mediation may be the answer here.</p>

<p>How about this -- go back to work simultaneous to the mediation happening?  They happen at the same time, so nobody is backing down first.</p>

<p>Trust Oppal.  I'm telling you, you can trust him.  He is going to help us out of this.</p>

<p>How will the Court ultimately decide to punish wilfull disobedience of a court order? You might want to keep Rafe Mair's comments from October 14th in mind: </p>

<p>"When Mr DeJong talks about contempt of the Supreme Court order he implies that the court has somehow approved the legislation, and past legislation giving rise to the contempt. It has done no such thing â€¦ the judge has simply enforced a Labour Relations Board decision, which under the law (she) is bound to do, then enforced the Courtâ€™s order which again is (her) job". The Judge is following the dictates of the legislature, and the union is showing contempt for the the legislation. There is very little spit in the eye of the courts here and no reason for a breach to be punished as if their were. I suspect this is one of the reasons Judge Brown declined to grant the application for massive fines and got creative with her order.</p>

<p>As to the perils of bankruptcy, most unions emerge insolvent from nasty fights. So what?</p>

<p>25 hours = 14 ideas for action; 1 concrete act.</p>

<p>161 postings.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will be travelling to Victoria to participate in the demonstration. I will be leaving my local where I am acting as strike coordinator.</p>

<p>I repeat my premise.</p>

<p>Clarity of purpose is important; it's time for principled action.</p>

<p>This blog can become a forum for taking political action, if you believe political action is important.</p>

<p>Here's how.</p>

<p>Post 1 example of a specific action you have taken or will take in the next 24 hours that you believe will have an effect on the parties involved and move negotiations forward.</p>

<p>Remember, it's not about ideas for what others can do but ways forward you have taken.</p>

<p>Simply to read of actions taken reafirms the power of collective action.</p>

<p>Below is a list of actions suggested so far. You be the judge of their concreteness and effectiveness.</p>

<p>1. Work collectively to approach financial institutions in the event of the denial of lines of credit or foreclosures.<br />
2. Collectively includes reaching out to non-union supporters to "chip in". To what or how this might be organized is still not clear but we're on our way.<br />
3. An appeal to local area residents and business owners to chip in. Good. An appeal by whom and how. Let's put some wheels on these.<br />
4. Great. Impromptu demonstations by students.<br />
5. Phone potential support on PAC (Parent Advisory Committee) and in the public. Give them at least one idea, such as writing letters/emailing/phoning to enourage a meeting. Or walking the line with us. Get THEIR phone trees started up.<br />
6.We can ask our school PACs to support and promote such efforts -- writing letters and organizing demonstrations of support on the picket lines (and I was not implying that all PACs were useless in my post above -- the key problem is BCCPAC's leadership or lack thereof --"SharingIsGood", your description fit to a T!). <br />
7.We can ask PACs and DPACs to pressure BCCPAC to take a stand as many of the school boards have done.<br />
8. We can ask the school boards that have not yet spoken up denouncing Bill 12 to do so.<br />
9.School trustees are facing re-election: we can ask sitting trustees and school board candidates to speak up re rescinding Bill 12 and urging government to meet with the teachers.<br />
10.Employers must be feeling the pinch of employee parents who are hamstrung by the strike, and the prospect of broader labour action -- encourage them to start putting pressure on the province.<br />
11. The Liberals will be polling quietly and monitoring the drift of letters published in local papers to gauge the public mood -- so keep sending letters to the papers.<br />
12. We should copy letters and e-mails to the Opposition Education critic (Jim Horgan?), as the Legislature will be sitting again next week.<br />
13.Parents can also network to support each other with child care, as the practical aspects are important to maintaining support if we're in for the long haul.<br />
14. Tie a green ribbon to your car aerial.</p>

<p>Clarity of purpose is important; it's time for principled action.</p>

<p>Oppal is a wonderful fellow, I agree. There's little he can do in this dispute and given the office he holds in should be expected to stay above the fray. Mediation is, I agree the answer. Vince Ready is in the wings! All we need is government agreement - and it'll come soon in my view.</p>

<p>spedteacher:  I know how you feel about me.  I can take it.  I'll be happy to absorb your anger and your frustration, if it helps.  I am not afraid to change my mind.  I had a revelation yesterday:  I don't like unions because of what happened to me when I was a teenager.  But I do like teachers.  Any parent who doubts how hard their job is, should go on a field trip some time and spend the day with all of those kids.  I guarantee you will come home with a renewed respect for teachers.  I have never said that I don't respect or like teachers, but I felt it important to point out the more ludicrous nature of the union position (likening the teachers' situation to "suffering", for example, which is ridiculous) by using humour in a lampoon style.  Also, the "lie" I told you was that initially I put forward that I did not have access to funds for babysitting, because many parents are in that position, to see how people would respond.  Parents who have NO MONEY probably don't read The Tyee.  Everything else I said has been true.  Trust me, or don't.  It's up to you.</p>

<p>Chella - I don't think you are going to resolve the dispute here. Mediation is the key, so I agree with your major premise. In my view, the great strength of the Tyee Boards is that they provide an opportunity to discuss and maybe clarify a lot of the misinformation and false premise building that is perpetrated by PR folks and main stream media. Adbusters used to have a term for this - was it culture jamming? I've forgotten. Anyway, whatever it is it's useful, I think. I try and throw in a little jamming of my own when I see things that are questionable being accepted as received fact. I probably talk to much. But I do enjoy reading the posts of others, including yourself - and I hope that all of this makes teachers feel bolstered in their fight.</p>

<p>Chella,</p>

<p>Darlin, you need to get your facts straight.  The essential service designation has been taken to the Supreme Court of Canada AND the United Nations.  Both of those bodies have deemed that the essential service goes against teachers basic human rights.  The UN urged the FIBerals to remove the designation.  In response, the FIBerals just wrote new legislation.</p>

<p>I know that I am not the only teacher who would be willing to accept a compromise to end this job action.  That is what negotiation is all about, after all.  But you don't seem to get it.  The FIBerals have lied to teachers and others in BC countless times.  I, for one, would not trust them to go back to work without a negotiated settlement.  NO WAY will I vote yes to going back to school without a negotiated settlement.  I'm not willing to be tricked into accepting a "contract" that makes provisions that the government doesn't fund ever again (as in the previous imposed "contract" which provided a raise that School Boards had to struggle to provide).  They aren't called the FIBerals for nothing, you know.</p>

Did you see my post about the green ribbon</h3>
<p>Mr. Gimpy,</p>

<p>Did you see my post about the green ribbon campaign?  Just in case you haven't ...</p>

<p>Teachers in my school district are purchasing green ribbon out of their own funds (keeping in compliance with the court order as no BCTF funds are involved) and passing it out to the public.  The public can choose to put that green ribbon on their vehicles to show support for BC teachers.  We are trying to spread the word around the province.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be wonderful if Victoria was full of cars with green ribbons on Monday?</p>

Thanks for the explanation. I see your point about</h3>
<p>Murdock<br />
Thanks for the explanation. I see your point about the difference between learning and education and I agree; kids who are not in school at this very moment are still learning, about life, video games, the mall or whatever. But Socrates' idea of learning as the gift of understanding indicates that there is a giver and a receiver of said gift. This means that learning, natural though it be, must be directed in order to extend understanding into new areas. That is what education is all about. As has been mentioned earlier in a quote from Paolo Friere, there is no politically neutral education. Choices are always made about what is taught and how.</p>

<p>A voucher system as you describe it seems perfectly reasonable, although I'm not sure how you would keep a voucher system from being corrupted to serve the needs of the few. I think where ever such a system has been tried, huge inequities have arisen, favouring those with more resources and influence. Also the small, accessible private schools you mentioned would likely be crippled economically in the face of larger education corporations, assuming the education industry goes the way of every other industry lately. </p>

<p>I'm not saying that our present system is the only one we should pursue, just that it seems to meet the needs of the many in a practical way. I'm sure there are other systems out there where the same needs are met in other ways. The Dutch system seems to be pretty interesting. As I understand it, the state pays for all education no matter what the religious or social aim of the school is. Parents really like it, but there are costs. Money, of course, and a tendency to streamline kids into trades and professions at a very early age. I don't pretend to know the details but perhaps you could look into it as an alternative to promote.</p>

<p>Spare me the 'good cop/bad cop' routine re Oppal and Taylor. It's too patriarchal for me!</p>

<p>I once held a good opinion regarding Judge Oppal, until he, (a SITTING JUDGE!) stepped down to run for a party who had an unresolved court case with allegations of money laundrying and boxes were carted out of the legislature for the first time in our history! What kind of discernment is that?</p>

<p>Ms Taylor, too choose to associate herself with a gov't that, in my opinion, is corrupt and without a doubt is deceitful. I am supposed to respect these two?</p>

<p>Good government is not run like a darn soap opera. Where some hero swoops in and saves the day. In spite of how everything is scripted by neo-cons to cover their lies.<br />
This is just one more example of why I have contempt for neo-Conservative thought and pretend governance. </p>

<p>We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The gov't needs to come to the tabe and negotiate rather than union bust.</p>

<p>In California their neo-con is doing his level best to destroy unions through prop 75, a potential piece of legislation which ties the hands of the unions and benefits the special interest group of the corporations,  This battle is a battle for the children and for the future. If the teachers obey this unjust law, their union will have been declawed and thus I don't know what Mr Shreck is talking about. They are taking rights away from British Columbians bit by bit and it has to stop. The wickedness of the people involved in this betrayal of the citizens is something to behold! But, it will not prevail.</p>

<p>Murdock, if you believe what you say, then why not put it to the people of British Columbia. Why not? Because they want a good public educations system. Just like you arent' asking about our health care system, instead are destroying it. .</p>

<p>We saw how an increase in private English schools, with less regulation under Campbell, resulted in many of those schools going broke mid term and closing their doors leaving their foreign students with no school and out their funds. In fact, it damaged our formally excellent reputation in Asia. I'm sure that helped our economy and the honest schools who just had their reputations smeared. Any small business person worth their salt would NOT vote for the BC Liberals. They are not the gov't for small business. They are hench men for multi-nationals.</p>

<p>There are sites given above which debunk the voucher sytem, which would only exist long enough to sell all the public school real estate for the same fire sale prices to their buddies, then once the system is finished they will eliminate vouchers and have complete say over education making it a training center for industry unless one has the fees for an expensive private school. The voucher system in the US also resulted in parents scrambling when the school went broke.</p>

<p>Freidman also advocated negative income tax which would provide poor people with a minimum guaranteed income, calling it just 'the price of doing business'. Why aren't you fighting for that tenet? Hmm?  Just picking and choosing the ones that put money in your own pocket, perhaps?</p>

<p>I find this comment very interesting. The reason that trades unions can negoiate successfully is the concept of competition, something socialists hate. Say you are a skilled concrete former; if your boss does not give you a decent shake of things, you can walk across the street to an employer who will. My own employees got very generous bonuses this year because I simply cannot afford to lose them. My people have rejected a union every time they came around (and I make no attempt to stop them, they are such clowns I love to listen the them.) The rhetoric spewed by the union people when they come to my job sites is simply hilarious, so much that last time my people simply laughed them off the place.</p>

<p>Then we have teachers. Little competition exists, altough it is quietly growing. They fee that they can defy the law because they have a monoploy of the service they provide. I have all kinds of rules and laws I have to obey in my business,some of which are inane and silly, but obey I must because it is the law.</p>

<p>If I do not like that law, I can vote in a government I feel will change things more to my liking. If I knowingly break that law, I am open for punishment.</p>

<p>Presently, I am doing a project for Coastal Health. These people are the epitome of regulations and rules. Can I pick and choose which ones I obey? Fat chance on that. If I want the job, I play the game. Why? Because if I want the work and to keep my people on that job, I have to follow the rules lest another company get the contract. That is competition.</p>

<p>Probably the most comical part about working on a hospital project is lunch time. Yesterday was a very nice day (and because of that we were working overtime) and a few of my empoyees and I were sitting on the grass eating our sandwiches. A union rep came up and proceeded preach about class struggle and how their bosses were exploting the workers. One of my boys looked over to me and said "Gee, boss, I would love to be exploited by you!"</p>

<p>With the resulting laughter, the union person ran away. I might add, I wear steel toes, work pants, a hard hat and Mac just like my workers do. The only difference is that I have the responsibility to make sure they continue to receive the high wages they do. A union won't do that for them.</p>

<p>I respect your opinion, lynn. The wonderful thing about democracy is that you will get a chance to vote again in 2009.</p>

<p>Perhaps you might want to examine why you lost last time in order to win the next. Can you do that without blaming others?</p>

<p>working person, your understanding of the issues leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>Teachers aren't breaking the law because they have a monopoly on education.  What an ignorant statement.</p>

<p>Try this analogy, tell your workers that you are going to decide what they get paid and if they don't like it you'll have the court force them to accept it.  Sure they can quit, but they'll have to find a new occupation or leave the province.</p>

<p>There are no defences.</p>

<p>For working person,</p>

<p>Thank you for expressing in plain terms and with anecdotal support.</p>

<p>The education system is acting like a monopoly that is resisting breakup to competition. Like it or not the teachers unions will have to accept this competitive change, for a system based on merit is required more than one based on 'time in'.</p>

<p>BEFORE ANY OTHERS COME BACK WITH ARGUMENTS THAT THE TEACHERS ARE NOT BASED ON 'TIME IN'.</p>

<p>I am well aware of the union rules and regulations regarding promotion and retention of teachers based on a points system that is weighted towards seniority and not skill currency.  This is a weakness of the hard closed-shop union environment.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Teachers aren't breaking the law because they have a monopoly on education. What an ignorant statement.</span></p>

<p>Try this analogy, tell your workers that you are going to decide what they get paid and if they don't like it you'll have the court force them to accept it. Sure they can quit, but they'll have to find a new occupation or leave the province.</p>

<p>Your pair of statements are opposed, for if the teachers college (controlled by the union at the moment) will not or de-certifies you as a teacher you MUST find a new occupation or leave the province.  That, to me, is the definition of a MONOPOLY, for the college has the power to create and/or destroy a teacher.  I accept that some standard must be maintained, however this power is being used in an enforcement way against those teachers who do not want to strike, let alone other skilled persons who cannot become a teacher in the closed-shop of BC education industry.</p>

<p>redrivergirl,</p>

<p>Yes private schools do exist, however those teachers in the private schools also have to be certified by the college, so the union has major input in their lives, even though they no longer have any say in that input.</p>

<p>I know of two private school teachers, who are unhappy with this situation, but are powerless to change it as the 'tyranny of the majority' holds the power within the education industry monopoly in BC.  Yes it is a monopoly ask any parent whom has had any conflict with with any teacher within the system.  Ask any parent when they are 'told' what school their children will attend (or not attend) and what curriculum they will learn and how that learning will happen.  </p>

<p>NO COMPETITION MEANS MONOPOLY in the PUBLIC EDUCATION INDUSTRY.</p>

<p>There are some misconceptions being used in some of the arguments posted here.</p>

<p>First, the BCTF does not have a monopoly on public education, the government does.  The BCTF has a monopoly on representing teachers who work in the public school system.  That is two very different things.</p>

<p>Second, the College of Teachers has eight reps elected by teachers and eight reps appointed by government.  The chair is also appointed by the government.  This is hardly a BCTF controlled institution, they can't decertify teachers unless they violate the code of ethics.  If you don't believe me, try BCCT.CA</p>

<p>Third, teachers don't decide what to teach, that is a matter of government policy.  As professionals, however, we do decide how to teach.  After all, I don't pay an airline to fly me to Toronto and then proceed to tell the pilot how to fly the plane!</p>

<p>see, you're ignoring that part of my analogy.  Teachers don't have that option.  Its the GOVERNMENT that has a near-monopoly on teacher employment.  And it is that same government that will use the force of their own quickly-passed laws to force their employees to take what the government orders them to take.  The teachers only recourse is to leave the province or find a new occupation.  </p>

<p>You claim you are the only one that understands competition but you don't seem to want to believe that it is your BC Liberal government that has the near-monopoly.</p>

<p>some excellent comments today, esp from chella, who actually is trying to separate fact from fiction (or, shall we say, overheated rhetoric). it's good to see oppal on the case - i DO believe the govt has to "stand down" on at least ONE thing, and perhaps this indicates some movement. we can only hope so.<br />
re: private schools - i was surprised upon moving to the Okanagan at just how many private schools there are up here - Waldorf, Montessori, the Xtian schools, etc. surprisingly, the one experiment in 'blue blood' style private schools - Central Okanagan Academy - went out of, uh, business last year just after constructing a brand new school. it now houses - public education irony, or what - a French school, for those from Quebec who live in the Okanagan or whose parents mother tongue is French. <br />
the faith-based schools - one just opened up, and its run by the Lutheran Church of Canada - hardly a bastion of hard-core evangelical thought - has an annual tuition per student of $1800. all the teachers are certified, and they follow the BC education curriculum. there is also, apparently, financial support available as well.<br />
however (this might shock some of you who think my previous postings have been right wing rants - alas, i've seen the excellent doc on the Winnipeg General Strike and dutifully learned about it in school) - the fact is we NEED public education to simply get kids from mixed social, religious, ethnic, and whatever else (disabilities) together to understand the cultural mosaic of Canadian society. i'm sorry, when i hear the term 'home schooling' the phrase 'wingnut' comes up next to it. <br />
that said, posters on this list would do well to read margaret wente's column on boys in the education system (in yesterday's Globe &amp; Mail) and today's Norman Spector column - most importantly, the quote by Jack Munro after the Kelowna Accord was reached. i know that Munro pissed the coyotes of the world off with his 'capitulation,' but BC then was a very different place. it's MUCH better now (though, i'll admit, it still is a province that has problems with distribution of wealth), and Munro recognized that the province was on the brink of social (not to mention economic) anarchy, and pulled back. i think he recognized what the role of unions in society really is.<br />
now, i know that Canwest takes a thorough beating on these boards, but has anyone gone to the good unions at those newspapers and asked for THEIR support - virtually all of the Canwest journos i know likely support the teachers, and might show some solidarity. and again, what about teamsters, trades, and tech unions?</p>

 Martin re your quote:<br />
"Sharing, surely you jest. <br />
If a teacher was found guilty of impaired driving, you say they'd be drummed out of the profession? That's a laugh. The college of teachers would give them a talking to, make them take a therapy course, and that would be it. Hugs all round. Case closed."<br />
...you have a problem with a union, society, or whatever trying to discipline one of their own?<br />
This is a common procedure that is carried on daily throughout the trade union movement, across this country. In my trade,(I'm now retired), we have substance abuse counsellors on our union payroll, the procedure was day work only, with attendance at counselling forums in the evening, shape up and if after six months there is improvement, then back to the traces, if not, look for other work, brother. We have human feelings for our weaker members, just as we have compassion for the subjects of this thread, who are by no means weak in their resolve to attain a just settlement of their grievances.<br />
So, let's not digress from the real issue here.</p>

<p>Ultimately I believe the question is whether the Government is willing to fire the teachers if it came to it. You can't force individual teachers to go back, even if we do live in Joesmith323's world of instant jailing of union officers for criminal contempt (and we don't). It's difficult to see firing a whole bunch of teachers - so I expect Government to back down and start negotiating soon once they seperate their calculations from their rhetoric and take a serious look at where this is all heading. Did someone say Wally Oppal is now involved? Is this speculation or was there an announcement I missed?</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly Average Joe! It's nice not to be alone. The possibility of a fine or a recognizance for good behaviour (and then eventually after a long process jail) remains a possibility, it seems much more unlikely if the BCTF complies with this order. Judge Brown's order is very unusual - and it may have had the effect of providing the means for the BCTF to  purge the contempt even while teachers stay out. BCTF can't be punished for individual teachers actions - even if they take those actions en masse. This order makes this a very different dispute and one that Victoria did not anticipate.</p>

<p>In the decision quoted by Average Joe Madame Justice Brown said.</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">[19]            The impositions of sanctions pursuant to R. 56 is adjourned generally.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>If you are going to mess around with court orders make sure you understand them.  She did not decide the punishment.  Punishment was adjourned.  Punishment is not "res judicata" and she is not "functus".</p>

<p>In any event, the contempt is continuing.  A new day is a new contempt and can give rise to new punishment.  </p>

<p>I am not trying to take sides in this issue.  Negotiations have broken down.  I expect that there is lots of blame on both sides.  My experiences with teachers and  with this government predisposes me to think that both are to blame.  </p>

<p>What I am seeing are posts about the law which are simply wrong.  What I am trying to do is simply point out what the law is.  If "Average Joe" or "John" have law degrees then you should be ashamed of the things you have posted about the law.  If you do not have law degrees then you should stop playing lawyer.  If you are parrotting things told to you by your lawyers, you need to get better lawyers.</p>

<p>joesmith323, if you'd care to say, where do you figure I'm gone wrong in my punditry?  Please take another look at rule 56 and then come back and throw nasty insults around. This is not a legal discussion board, and I'm sure no one is relying on either of our opinions.., but just between you and me you're missing a pretty significant point, which I suspect might eventually dawn on you after you take another look at Rule 56.  You're right she's not functus and that punishment is not res judicatta. Has this now exhausted your latin?  I agree a lot of nonsense has been said about the law, and its best not to confuse issues further by trying to settle a score with you... </p>

"... getting rid of the 10% of teachers who do more harm than good in the class room."  There is NO evidence for that statement. </p>

<p>Murdock, Gimpy and Chella:<br />
You are getting your feathers all puffed up with self importance here.  This is just a debate based on an article.  YOU are not really controlling anything.  The BCTF, the government and the courts are already aware of every idea, suggestion and systemic possibility that has been raised.  To have an action endorsed by the BCTF you must be a member, put your idea to the union, and if it is endorsed as a recommendation, it will then go to debate and the opportunity to vote on it will be given to the entire membership. So, there is NO POINT in telling teachers what to do in this forum.  All 10 or 15 teachers here aren't a drop in the 40,000 possible votes and from what I read, they are staying out, until a real agreement is made in writing.</p>

<p>Working Person:<br />
The unions negotiate your workers' pay.  THEY set the standard for your employees.  You said it yourself.  If you don't exceed union pay they're gone.<br />
"because I simply cannot afford to lose them."<br />
What would your workers be paid if there were no unions?  Why don't you encourage them to join a union, so that you could pay them less?<br />
... working conditions? ... safety?</p>

<p>Homeschooling: Fine, if your child won't work at school (behaviour problem, etc.) and you can control that behaviour in a one-on-one situation.  But unless the parents have the time, energy, teaching expertise, and the specialized knowledge of the teams of teachers in school systems, it all falls apart at about grade 8 or 9.  The students either re-enter an educational institution at that time (often deprived of some aspects of normal schooling both academic and social), or they quit, and close the door on their chances to be educated for the modern working world. It is not reasonable to expect 2 parents (often one, if someone needs to work) to replace the educational opportunities provided by a diverse 30 to 40 member staff of secondary teachers, concentrating on instruction and learning, and nothing else, all day.</p>

<p>Voucher system:  An old, old, idea which has been tried repeatedly and has not worked.</p>

<p>Chella: You've been duped.  If "being in school" were the criterion for bargaining, the government has had years to bargain.  The government is playing a game here that has nothing to do with the law, bargaining, or anything else.  They have everything that has gone on recorded (they don't need your list).  They CAUSED this job action and now they want to be seen as stopping it.  It's a PR crock.</p>

<p>If teachers were to go back before written agreements are made, they lose, automatically.  No raise, no change in conditions, and no bargaining rights.  It is my opinion (and I don't suppose to tell anyone what to do) that if teachers were to go back before bargaining occurs, then all they have given up (I make it roughly $55,000,000 in personal pay alone) would have been for NOTHING.</p>

<p>I also think that if the NDP committed the same atrocities while in power, that the union action taken would have been identical.  As elementary teachers say to those who can't get along with others:- </p>

<p>Little Gordon needs a "time out"!</p>

Enlighten this poor teacher, please.  How is</h3>
<p>joesmith323,</p>

<p>Enlighten this poor teacher, please.  How is the BCTF to blame for any of this?  We have had our last 2 (or is it 3?) contracts imposed upon us.  Our bargaining team met with BCPSEA 35 times from June 2004 - Oct. 2005.  Each everytime it was very obvious that BCPSEA was stalling.  First it was because of the upcoming election, then there was another excuse.  The UN and the Supreme Court have ruled against the Liberals and in favor of the BCTF but the Liberals just ignore these rulings or change the laws to suit their purposes.  I truly cannot see how this is serving the people of BC in an appropriate manner.  </p>

<p>Give me a break!  How many times does Jinny have to say that "we are available 24/7" before you people will believe her????  She was at the BCTF building all weekend and no negotiations took place.  How much more available does the BCTF have to be???  The government pushed us into this only a few days into work-to-rule.  Schools weren't closed then in case you didn't notice!!!  Were you there to console the teachers after hearing of Bill 12 and feeling that they had been kicked in the teeth once again???  We were forced into this by the government.  The BCTF Exec. had heard time and time again from the teachers of BC .. we do not want to have to hide away with our tails between our legs!!!!</p>

<p>All the Liberals had to do was negotiate as opposed to litigate.  I hear that's the way Gordo likes to do things anyway lol.  I'm willing to bet (and I know there are many out there who won't believe me) that a contract could have been settled with an agreement to cap class sizes and some sort of guarantee for student support services.  Maybe a tiny raise or even a promise of a raise at a later date would have sufficed.  After all, the MLAs got a raise and they found money for that!!</p>

<p>Right now I have eight (of a company workforce of 45) and I sincerely hope all will finish their terms with us. BCIT has an excellent apprentice programme and I am hoping to get more in the near future but the supply is quite tight at the moment.</p>

<p>That said, laying off an apprentice is one of the stupidist things a company can do. All businesses have cycles and once you let an apprentice go it is very difficult to get him/her back.</p>

<p>In the great chasm that was the 1990's economically, we resorted to work sharing programmmes with our people to keep them employed and with us. Those were hard years but we learned how to be competitive. That really paid off when the economy picked up after 2001. If you are looking for shiny new trucks you will not see them with our company logo on them!</p>

I guess this is how the "Liberals" - yeah, right! - "respect" their hardworking educators: zero pay increase; deteriorating classroom conditions; and no strike pay.  If I wasn't totally for this job action before, I am now!  But I keep asking myself the following: 1.) Where is the NDP Opposition?!; 2.) Where is the Premier?!; 3.) Where is the leadership in this crisis?!; and 4.) Where are the parents?!  After all, we educators are taking a major financial hit for their children.  As Week 2 is about to begin, this educator is getting quite disgusted by all the politics and lack of sincere, honest negotiation.  What a shameful precedent for the kids of this province!   This is a black eye for both the government and its business climate.</p>

<p>Just a comment on the issue of laid off apprentices before they recieve their ticket.  Working Man is to be congratulated for keeping these apprentices on for the full term(he did say that didn't he).  Lots of companies do not.  In a local of 51 members we have at least 5 people who have come from non union companies with a two or three year credit towards their ticket.  The reason for this I suspect is once an apprentice completes his ticket the company has to pay the full wage.  The government trough is no longer available.  Try to get hired in your choosen trade as a third year apprentice.  Most union agreements offer protection from this very thing happening.  I might add this protection in no way hurts these companies.</p>

<p>Working Man</p>

<p>8 apprentices out of 45 employees is an admirable ratio.  I teach mainly industrial education so I try to keep track of which of my students ends up with an apprenticeship.  One of the trends that I have noticed in my town is that it is mainly small business that employs apprentices, not large industry.  That, to me, is an indictment of the large corporations that funded Campbell's campaign.</p>

<p>As for your business, it can in no way be compared to public education as far as an employer goes.  The Ministry of Education and school boards are a huge bureaucracy, in no way sensitive to either their clients (parents and students) or their employees (teachers, maintenance and support staff).</p>

<p>All the literature on bureaucracy I've read indicates that its main concern is the perpetuation of itself not the service of its clients.  I wish the public school system could be the happy laissez fair crew your business seems to be, but it isn't going to happen. :-(</p>

<p>You know, before this strike (yes, it is a strike, screw the idea that it is anything else), I always figured the majority of teachers to be basic idiots.  Now I know the exact figure - 90.5%.  But hey, teachers work 24/7.  That would be 24 hours per week, 7 months per year.</p>

<p>Face it, the vast majority of you went into teaching after you flunked out of a real faculty at university.  Forget all the feel good - we went into the vocation of teaching for the joy of enriching the youth etc etc - you do it for the paycheck.  And this entire strike is over two very simple premises - you want more money and less work.  There, someone had to say it.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to seeing how much resolve you have when the next obvious move for the Supreme Court is to start fining individual teachers.  Slim Jinny sitting there pulling your puppet strings all the while collecting her salary which was paid for by you. And you will get to pay the judiciary a couple of bills a day.</p>

<p>Forecast is for rain the rest of the week.  Enjoy.</p>

<p>John:  I have read Rule 56.  Most of what you have written about the law is wrong and I have already said so in other posts.  The danger of what you are saying about the law is that there might be people out there who listen to you. If you are ashamed everyday of being a lawyer then you should change careers.  I have never, in over twenty years at the bar, been ashamed of being a lawyer even when I have disagreed with laws or judges' decisions.</p>

<p>Average Joe:  If the BCTF tries to argue in court that they have lost control of their members many judges would laugh out loud.  Madame Justice Brown is probably too well socialized to laugh in their faces but there is not a chance she will believe them.</p>

<p>Thanks Mr. Gimpy for keeping an action plan in front of us. I'm neither a teacher nor a parent; I'm a taxpaying citizen of BC who values a well-educated community, who believes a good education makes good sense for us all not just for those who are well-off. </p>

<p>Huge thanks to redrivergirl and others for ripping into Chella's multiple postings of adoration for Wally Oppal and Carole Taylor. When "girl" characterized them as being set up as the "good cops" to de Jong and Campbell's "bad cops," she hit the nail on the head. I too am mighty uncomfortable that Oppal agreed so readily to take the top lawmaker cabinet posting in the Campbell government despite the serious (and mysterious) criminal charges pending against appointees of this government. </p>

<p>I can't be in Victoria tomorrow, but I will be displaying a green ribbon around my town tomorrow, and I will head down to the nearest picket line to offer my financial support to offset the loss of strike pay to teachers. I will phone my local school trustees to see what they have done to express their concerns to government, and urge them to do something if they have not.</p>

<p>Finally, I will be talking to local businesses about the BC Business Federation (not sure of their formal name). Their spokesperson, Kevin Evans, came out today on CBC Radio saying they are concerned that this illegal strike is "hurting the economic and social fabric" of the province and they want it to stop. I want their business members to feel the heat. I won't shop at any member of this BC Business Federation because of their position. See if the judge can stop me from exercising my right! Let's make them feel some financial burden, and since they are Campbell's supporters, maybe they'll have some influence there. So, people out there, inquire of any businesses you patronize this week, whether they are a member of the BC Business Federation, and if they are, express your concerns and if you can, don't give them your business. Just another idea.</p>

<p>Average Joe: If the BCTF tries to argue in court that they have lost control of their members many judges would laugh out loud. </p>

<p>Joesmith323, surely with all that schooling you have had from all those professional teachers you've benefited from as a youngster, and all the time you have spent studying our just and democratic laws, that even you would be able to see that Judge Brown has striped the BCTF from representing it's members.</p>

<p><div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body">6]               <span style="font-weight:bold"> The BCTF acts through its members to commit the contempt.</span>  It is apparent from the materials before me that the BCTF is using its assets to facilitate the continuing breach of the court order, in part by paying teachers.</blockquote></div></p>

<p>[7]                <span style="font-weight:bold">I will enjoin the BCTF and related entities </span>(and here I am contemplating wholly-owned subsidiaries, trusts, etc, because I do not understand or know the exact mechanism that the BCTF is using to facilitate the breach of the court order, it appears that there may be funds solely in control of the BCTF) and (<span style="font-style:italic">don't know why the word "and" is here?</span>) <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">from using their assets</span> to further the breach of the court order of October 6, 2005.</span></p>

<p>[9]                <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">The BCTF is restrained for 30 days from directly or indirectly using its assets to facilitate breach of the court order of October 6, 2005.</span></span>  In particular, the BCTF is enjoined from paying amounts to its members as â€œstrike payâ€ or to otherwise compensate members for loss relating to breach of the order of October 6, 2005; from providing guarantees or promises to pay to protect members from such losses; <span style="text-decoration:underline">from using its books records and offices to permit third parties to facilitate continuing breach of the court order.</span>[/B]  Either party may apply to extend or shorten this order.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Clearly, Judge Brown as taken away all abilities of the BCTF to financially facilitate any directional authority by the BCTF toward it's members. </p>

<p>The BCTF is not breaching this order and therefore cannot be held responsible for the progression of the teachers. </p>

<p>They are now self directing themselves, and doing a fine job I might add, after all, they are educated teachers.</p>

<p>Heck, even my son in elementary school will tell you that.</p>

Oct, 16 2005 - 9:20 PM</blockquote></div></p>

<p> <br />
VANCOUVER(CKNWAM980) - Three business leaders are chastizing the BC Federation of Labour for supporting the teachers' strike. Jerry Lampert, president and CEO of the Business Council of BC, says organized labour's supporting the strike makes a mockery of the justice system. Instead of staging a rally, Lampert suggests the BC Fed should take a "responsible role" by abiding by the law.<br />
BCTF President Jinny Sims says that message is "unfortunate". She says the teachers have simply taken a stand against unjust legislation. </p>

<p>But Kevin Evans, chair of the Coalition of BC Businesses says the strike is not about politics, but about breaking the law.</p>

<p>"The continued defiance of that order is not a confrontation between government," he says, "but a confrontation, a challenge of the authority and legitimacy of our courts, the highest authority of the land and our impartial guardians of the rule of law."</p>

<p>Evans says the teachers' defiance will create an instability in the provincial economy which will be "anathema" to investors and long-term economic fallout.</p>

<p>Shame, all that business that will be lost tomorrow, even more in the days ahead, if the government doesn't wise up. This is an unjust law, the government needs to fix it and fast.</p>

<p>KILL BILL 12</p>

<p>Did De jong say tonight on Global that he wants the BCTF to tell it's members to get back to work so they can negotiate? Are you going on holidays? Where's Gordo?</p>

<p>Too late De jong, the courts have striped the BCTF with the financial ability to contact their members. You would not be asking the BCTF to breach a court order would you? Shame on you.<br />
40,000 teachers are taking up the fight now, it's out of the BCTF's hands.</p>

<p>Let's face it: the teachers have won this battle by a whopping margin. It's all over now, and we're all just waiting for the proverbial fat lady to sing.</p>

<p>It is truly a joy to read the neocon posts lately.  You can smell the steam pouring out their deaf ears.  Man are they ever pissed! </p>

<p>It's the second intermission, the teachers are leading eight to zero, and everyone's eager to see if the government can pot a few in the third period.  </p>

<p>My prediction: each side scores a goal in the final frame.</p>

<p>Final score = Teachers 9, Gordo's Gang 1</p>

<p>Damn, this has been a fun shit-kicking to watch!  A lopsided victory like this won't be seen for another 50 years.  </p>

<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to put the bubbly on ice...</p>

<p>Looking back over that sad progression of Mr. Sturdy's input, I can only say: It is what I thought, there are forces afoot to systematically gut public education, so that the children of politicos and their cronies, who go to private schools, will have an uneven playing field to their advantage. NDP governments have probably tried to standardise and even out, but then have never had the dough to back it up, because they have been crazy spenders in other areas. Let it also be said, though, that what is wrong in our schools cannot be fixed with money alone, we also need to effect a cultural shift, where we start lookning at every person as having an intrinsic value, rather than being one unit of a cheap commodity. School should not teach, but help to learn. It should not process, but support. It should not deliver a product, but make available what is needed for individual development. Only thus will our unique strengths come together and add up to a whole worth living with. And maybe, just maybe, the 'war on drugs' will become yesterday's problem...</p>

<p>A brief comment to sdgreen...Your limited perspective is showing when you highlight the absence of mere "things" (books and classroom tables)  as the focus of teachers' complaints about the system. Our concern relates to far more important issues. One is the fear that the privatization of education will result in a two-tiered system producing a malleable, disheartened, dumbed- down work force suitable to  compete against China and India in the "all important" global market. Another is the abuse of of power demonstrated by the Campbell governmant as they run roughshod over workers' rights, ignoring both our constitutional right to collective bargaining and international censure from the UN. This regime cannot accuse teachers of being lawbreakers unless they admit their own culpability. They are hypocrites pure and simple.</p>

<p>average joe and Frank ... as much as I applaud your efforts to reinforce unions by pushing for boycotts, let's not kill the baby yet. Membership councils for businesses are important for increasing and upholding standards, too, for workers and customers alike. Since many independent contractors begin as 1 or 2 person operations and gradually increase as their businesses thrive, for example, these organizations are helpful by bringing them in line with things like safety education. I think the important thing is to engage in a conversation with the owners and managers of the businesses you frequent or hire and start countering the misleading information they receive from political operatives. Tell them what you value. Show them where Liberals are killing off their communities. If you're paying their bills, they are more interested in what you have to say than what lobbyists are spouting.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Wally Oppal</span> has just announced that he has appointed a <span style="font-weight:bold">special prosecutor</span> to take over the comtempt proceedings against the teachers. More details will be coming this afternoon.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago he was saying on the radio how "creative and sophisticated" judge Browns' decision was, but he was seen on the weekend on TV huddling with other liberal ministers.</p>

<p>I guess they had to remind him that he was now a Campbell lackie, and was no longer able to think for himself.</p>

<p>I just don't know how many businesses join the Council for its political affiliations, Frank, or how many of them are even aware of where the larger organization is taking them. And I wouldn't assume too much in that respect. Reasons for memberships might be something as simple as that these sub-affiliate groups provide the most up-to-date and accurate public tender notices, or offer free courses. There could be any reason.</p>

<p>That's why I think it's really important to accentuate the community building aspects first. If you actually are a customer, use your clout first before throwing it away. That's the secret of activism. Go to the individual businesses and ask them if they are even aware of what this Council is doing? Half the time, I wager they aren't or they haven't had time to check it out. Find out why they're members and handle that. Offer a better, more pragmatic alternative. That's key.</p>

<p>Sorry, Blonde. The BCTF nor the BCGEU were not elected into public office so they have no voice in public policy making any more than I do. The UN is a farce, if you have not figured that out it.

If your favoured party cannot win elections, ask yourself "why?" and try to change your party so it <span style="font-weight:bold">can</span>win elections, insteading of blaming others.</p>

<p>The "art of the deal" is certainly lost on the BCTF; it seems the only negotiating tool it knows how to use is the hammer.<br />
  Teachers certainly have the attention of the public, and no doubt the support of a majority of British Columbians, including mine.  However, with the attention they have won, it's now time to go back to work, do the right (and legal) thing, and put the ball squarely back into the court of the Liberals.  Prolonging this "job action" (actually more like a pissing contest" will only alienate the taxpayer.<br />
If teachers return to work, the public will be watching every move the Government makes.  It could be a win-win situation.</p>

<p>"Well, since 1993 we have never managed to negoiate a contract, even with our NDP buddies. Perhaps if we actually did sign a deal it would pave the way to get more of what we want next time. We might even stand a chance of keeping all the power locked up on 6th Avenue because district bargaining is looking like it will become a reality soon."</p>

<p>What makes the special prosecutor so "special"? someone asked.<br />
________________________________________________________________________<br />
The British Columbia government has hired an independent special prosecutor to look at whether the provincial teachers' union should face criminal contempt charges.</p>

<p>In a statement, the Attorney-General's criminal justice branch said it has appointed senior Vancouver lawyer <span style="font-weight:bold">Leonard Doust</span> to handle the matter.<br />
________________________________________________________________________<br />
On Tuesday, June 01, 2004, David Ramsay, a former Prince George, British Columbia Provincial Court Judge, was sentenced to seven years in prison by Associate Chief Justice Patrick Dohm after pleading guilty to five <br />
charges stemming from incidents in 1992 to 2000 involving Indigenous girls aged 12 - 16: sexual assault causing bodily harm, breach of trust and three counts of buying sex from minors. These girls had appeared in Ramsay's court.</p>

<p>He called the girls whores, paid them to perform demeaning sex acts and warned them no cop would ever believe their story.</p>

<p>His <span style="font-weight:bold">defense</span> lawyer, <span style="font-weight:bold">Leonard Doust</span>, argued for a sentence of no more than four years, even though the Assembly of First Nations and the Native Womenâ€™s Association of Canada stated that the former Judge deserved â€œthe harshest sentence possible."<br />
________________________________________________________________________<br />
The decision to charge Svend Robinson on June 21, 2004, was made by Vancouver lawyer <span style="font-weight:bold">Leonard Doust</span>, an special prosecutor appointed by the province.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Gaul, the director of legal services for Crown counsel, said the timing of the charge -- just one week away from an election -- was coincidental. <span style="font-weight:bold">Politics played absolutely no role</span> in this assessment" of whether or not to lay criminal charges.</p>

<p>So a "Special Prosecutor" has been brought into the equation.</p>

<p>Let me do the math...</p>

<p>(Special Prosecutor + Attempt at Criminal Prosecution) +  BC shutdown  <br />
= Huge dollars loss to BC Business.</p>

<p>Let's do some more math in Blog Class today...</p>

<p>Fines to BCTF + Fines to members <br />
= Huge Dollars lost Nationally to Business(To the one-hundredth exponent)</p>

<p>I will make two suggestions.</p>

<p>1) Business, you better leash your dog Gordo and quick. Tick, tock, tick, tock...(ooops, was that another potential investment out the window?)</p>

<p>2) Judge Brown, with utmost respect, please consider the financial best interest of the province and Canada. No amount of fines are going to recoup the potential financial loss. Criminal prosecution? Times the loss by 100.</p>
