</H1>

<H2>
<HR>
<A NAME="Heading1"></A>CHEMICALS</H2>

<P>In an attempt to build its pharmaceuticals division, midsized
chemical manufacturer TOAGOSEI CO., LTD. teamed up with PROTEIN
DESIGN LABS, INC. The collaboration includes a $2 million investment
in the Mountain View, California firm, which specializes in the
development of humanized and human antibodies to prevent or treat a
number of problems. PDL also is humanizing one of Toagosei's
antibodies that has potential as a cancer treatment. SANKYO CO., LTD.
also is working with PDL (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 334,
July 1997, p. 2).</P>

<P>The eight-month-old research and development relationship between
ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. and TREGA BIOSCIENCES, INC. (see
Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 334, July 1997, p. 2) is on the verge
of expansion. Under the pending arrangement, the San Diego,
California drug discovery firm will optimize lead compounds
discovered by Japan's 12th-largest drug company and screen those
compounds in other areas of interest to Ono. The initial agreement
focused on melanocortin receptor research for inflammatory diseases.
Ono will provide additional research funding for the new work.</P>

<P>NIPPON KAYAKU CO., LTD. also has turned to a U.S. drug discovery
company to speed product development. Under a two-year deal, the
diversified chemical company will work with SIGNAL PHARMACEUTICALS,
INC. to develop and commercialize a small molecule nerve growth
factor mimetic, its lead compound for the treatment of peripheral
neuropathies. These are disorders resulting from diabetes and other
injuries to the peripheral nerves. The strength of the San Diego,
California business is its unique human neuronal cell lines, which
will be employed to further optimize the Nippon Kayaku compound and
characterize its mechanism of action before the start of clinical
studies. The partners will share marketing rights to the drug outside
Japan. TANABE SEIYAKU CO., LTD. also has a drug discovery program
underway with Signal.</P>

<P>Although best known as a producer of over-the-counter drugs, SS
PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. has developed the first of a new generation
of aceticholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease. T-82 is said to minimize the side effects sometimes
associated with the first two AchE inhibitors approved for sale in
the United States because it enters the central nervous system more
easily. ARENA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. has won the exclusive right to
manufacture and market T-82 outside Japan. The year-old San Diego,
California biotechnology company expects to begin clinical testing in
the United States and Europe later this year. Arena Pharmaceuticals
says that it could take another four or five years before T-82
becomes available for sale.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="Heading2"></A>COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS</H2>

<P>Direct marketer AKIA CORP. is claiming bragging rights to the
first Pentium II-based, all-in-one desktop personal computer. The
space-saving Fusion OneBox runs off either a 233-megahertz or a
266-MHz version of INTEL CORP.'s highest-performance processor and
offers as much as 6.4 gigabytes of hard disk drive storage as well as
other high-end features. Integrated with it is a 14.5-inch color TFT
(thin-film-transistor) active- matrix liquid crystal display monitor.
The two configurations of the Fusion OneBox are priced at $3,000 and
$3,400.</P>

<P>The Austin, Texas unit of AKIA CORP., which is trying to make a
name for itself in the crowded American PC marketplace by focusing on
small- footprint LCD systems, is billing the new Mystique Complete as
the first truly affordable LCD-based desktop package. Priced from
$2,700, the high- performance, feature-laden system is powered by a
233-MHz Pentium processor with MMX technology. The separate color TFT
AMLCD monitor provides a viewable area of 14.5 inches.</P>

<P>Continuing its push into the portable computer marketplace,
HITACHI PC CORP. expanded its Hitachi VisionBook line both up and
down. At the high end, the Milpitas, California company introduced
the Hitachi VisionBook Pro at estimated street prices of $3,200 to
$4,800. Incorporating 200- MHz, 233-MHz and 266-MHz mobile Pentium
processors with MMX technology, the new notebooks combine system and
multimedia performance with high-speed communications connections via
integrated 10/100Base-T local area network support and a U.S.
Robotics 56K cellular-ready modem with x2 technology from 3COM CORP.
At the market's other end, Hitachi PC is selling the Hitachi
VisionBook Plus 5000 value line. The two multimedia-oriented products
run off a 166-MHz mobile Pentium processor ($1,700) or the 233-MHz
version ($2,300). One feature touted in particular is the extended
life (more than four hours) of the line's battery.</P>

<P>Budget-conscious mobile computer users have an alternative in the
latest addition to the LifeBook 700 Series from Milpitas,
California-based FUJITSU PC CORP. Roughly $1,500 buys the fully
configured, high- performance, multimedia LifeBook 765Dx. A 166-MHz
Pentium processor with MMX technology gives the 765Dx its power.</P>

<P>The TeamPad 7600 pen-based portable computer from FUJITSU-ICL
SYSTEMS INC. now can be integrated with Mountain View,
California-based PROMIX, INC.'s RangeLAN2 wireless local area network
technology. The combination will give health-care providers access to
patient and medical information systems from the point of care or
from anywhere in a facility that wireless LAN coverage is available.
The TeamPad 7600 weighs just 1.7 pounds and has a large color screen.
Dallas-based Fujitsu-ICL is a partnership between FUJITSU, LTD. and
ICL PLC of London.</P>

<P>A competing lightweight, compact pen-based computer for the
health-care industry is on the market from SEIKO EPSON CORP.'s
subsidiary. The EHT- 410 is said to support more accessories and
peripherals, including a keyboard and a bar-code scanning wand, than
any other system in its class. DOS- and Windows 95-compliant, the
unit, which has a 7.7-inch color display, starts at $3,500.</P>

<P>After 15 years of ownership by NIPPON CHEMI-CON CORP., the top
U.S. maker of high-resolution medical monitors, DATA RAY CORP., will
be sold in April to WELLS-GARDNER ELECTRONICS CORP. for an
undisclosed price. Westminster, Colorado-based Data Ray expects to
report revenues of roughly $25 million in 1998. Its medical monitor
sales have climbed by 26 percent a year for the past two years.
Wells-Gardner, headquartered in Chicago, also makes monitors, with
sales to the amusement, gaming, leisure and fitness, automotive,
intranet and video wall markets.</P>

<P>After a four-year absence, RICOH CO., LTD. expects to reenter the
American laser printer market this fall. The big copier manufacturer,
which has found success in digital copiers, will take aim at the
growing network demand for combination facsimile-printer-copier
systems. It began selling laser printers here in 1986 but abandoned
the market in 1994 after failing to make an impact.</P>

<P>Recordable compact disc manufacturer MITSUI ADVANCED MEDIA, INC.
of Colorado Springs, Colorado is producing for HEWLETT-PACKARD CO.
its new brand of Gold on Gold CD-R media. Like the Mitsui Gold CD-Rs
that the MITSUI CHEMICALS, INC. subsidiary sells, the HP media is the
result of a patented process for applying phthalocyanine dye to the
disc so that the gold layer shows through. That is said to provide
for more reliable storage of data and to produce a more durable
product. The CD-Rs hold up to 650 megabytes of data and can be read
by any standard CD-ROM (read-only memory) player, CD-R or CD-RW
(ReWritable) drive, or multiread- compatible digital versatile disc
drives.</P>

<P>Targeting the next generation of enterprise data storage, HITACHI,
LTD. affiliate HITACHI DATA SYSTEMS CORP., a major provider of IBM-
compatible mainframe storage products, and DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP., a
leader in storage solutions for open systems, have forged a
development and marketing agreement. In the initial phase of the
alliance, DEC will integrate with its DIGITAL StorageWorks family of
products for the Unix platform Santa Clara, California-based HDS's
6700 and 7700 scalable arrays. These are high-capacity storage
subsystems designed to support open systems and mainframes.</P>

<A NAME="Heading3"></A>CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE</H2>

<P>Although it no longer makes the news, the retrenchment of Japanese
investors from the American property market continues. For instance,
the Miami subsidiary of contractor JDC CORP. sold the 33-story
Brickell BayView Centre Building in Miami for $23.9 million, in the
process incurring a loss of $20 million. The affiliate also sold its
25 percent share of the Scottsdale Princess Hotel in Arizona to its
partner for $27.3 million. That deal netted a profit of roughly $20
million.</P>

<P>Likewise, condominium developer URBAN LIFE CO., LTD. has pulled
out of the U.S. market. The firm sold its wholly owned Bellevue,
Washington subsidiary as well as its 49 percent stake in a
partnership building 239 units in Seattle to the project's
codeveloper. The two transactions produced a net loss of about $1.3
million. Urban Life also is in the process of liquidating a Garrison,
New York subsidiary that had a $50 million luxury housing development
project underway in the New York City suburb. Both affiliates were
set up in 1990.</P>

<P>Perhaps not surprisingly, at least one company sees opportunity in
corporate Japan's money-driven need to pull out of the U.S. property
market. RECRUIT COSMOS CO., LTD. is providing real estate advisory
services to investors looking for buyers in cooperation with DEUEL
GROUP, INC. of Laguna Hills, California. Even before the firm made
this business a full-fledged operation in January, it already had
helped a number of Japanese firms sell their American holdings,
including office buildings, condos and apartment complexes.</P>

<A NAME="Heading4"></A>ELECTRIC MACHINERY</H2>

<P>One of the biggest manufacturers of television picture tubes in
the United States is moving into tubes for computer displays.
Horseheads, New York- based TOSHIBA DISPLAY DEVICES, INC. has
committed an initial $40 million to launch production of 17-inch
minineck color display tubes in August. The reduced size of this
tube's neck allows the deflection yoke to be smaller, thereby cutting
the monitor's power consumption. In early 1999, TDD will add a
17-inch CDT with a microfilter, which improves brightness, contrast
and color fidelity as well as trims power consumption. In the summer
of 1999, the company will begin to make a 19-inch CDT featuring a
rectangular cone system deflection yoke design that requires 30
percent less deflection power than conventional display tubes and
incorporating in addition a microfilter. A wholly owned TOSHIBA CORP.
subsidiary since 1988, TDD currently manufactures more than 2 million
midsize and super large-size color picture tubes a year with a work
force of nearly 1,600 people.</P>

<P>SANYO TECHNOSOUND CO., LTD. and LSI LOGIC CORP. have teamed up to
help consumer electronics manufacturers get the second generation of
DVD players to the market more quickly and to ramp up production
faster. Their solution is a complete manufacturing kit. The year-old
SANYO ELECTRIC CO., LTD. subsidiary is contributing its DVD player
drive to the kit, which is based on LSI Logic's reference design and
includes the company's L64020 integrated DVD audio/video decoder
system-on-a-chip. The kit also provides comprehensive software,
hardware, debug and test components.</P>

<P>In April, SONY PRECISION TECHNOLOGY INC. will put on the American
market the PC-Millman, a computer numerical controller for milling
machines. Able to control two or three axes, the product is said to
be easy enough to program for a beginner to operate. Moreover, even
complicated shapes like circles can be milled automatically. The
PC-Millman, which uses a 120-megahertz Pentium processor as the
controller chip, will be priced between $12,500 and $15,500.</P>

<P>As part of the turnaround strategy for its North American
industrial automation business, YOKOGAWA ELECTRIC CORP. has moved
into the plant control market. It has a contract in hand to deliver
turnkey systems to automate control of plant operations at two U.S.
engineering plastics factories run by GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.'s
Pittsfield, Massachusetts- headquartered GE Plastics unit. This order
is a first for a Japanese company. To support the new focus as well
as its other process control lines, manufacturer YOKOGAWA INDUSTRIAL
AUTOMATION AMERICA, INC. of Newnan, Georgia (see Japan-U.S. Business
Report No. 337, October 1997, p. 6) plans to strengthen its software
development center in Dallas and open up three more service
facilities in 1999.</P>

<P>A partnership formed late last year by trader NICHIMEN CORP. and a
Dutch company that is the world's second-biggest producer of
wind-generated electricity has acquired for $38 million one of the
largest power plants in the United States driven by wind. The
facility, located in Livermore, California, was purchased from
bankrupt KENETECH WINDPOWER INC. It has a generating capacity of
164,000 kilowatts. GREEN RIDGE POWER LLC will operate the plant.
Nichimen, which expects its investment in the Livermore plant to pay
off in five to eight years, and its partner are weighing other
power-generating operations in the United States.</P>

<P>MITSUI MINING &amp; SMELTING CO., LTD., the dominant supplier of
mercury- free zinc powder in the United States, is doubling the
capacity to make this raw material for manganese alkaline batteries
at MITSUI/ZCA ZINC POWDERS CO. A second line will be operational in
1999, boosting the factory's annual mercury-free zinc powder capacity
to about 13,200 tons. The expansion reflects swelling U.S. demand for
long-life batteries as notebook computers and other mobile
information devices proliferate, although some of the extra output
will be shipped to Europe and South America. Formed in 1992,
Mitsui/ZCA is equally owned by Mitsui Mining and ZINC CORP. OF
AMERICA.</P>

<P>Buttressing its position in the market for laser welders and
precision resistance welding systems, the Monrovia, California
subsidiary of MIYACHI TECHNOS CORP. acquired DIRECTED LIGHT, INC.
That San Jose, California company does laser contract manufacturing
as well as develops manufacturing solutions involving laser systems
for everything from welding to cutting. With 35 employees, DLI did
about $9 million worth of business last year. The acquisition cost
was estimated at $3.3 million. Its new parent is UNITEK MI-YACHI
CORP., which the Japanese firm acquired in late 1994. Unitek Miyachi,
which has annual revenues of $40 million, makes YAG
(yttrium-aluminum-garnet) laser welders and resistance welding power
supplies, weld heads and weld monitors. It also sells Miyachi
Technos-built resistance weld power supplies and weld monitors.</P>

<P>Smaller Japanese machine tool builders continue to win orders from
the American automotive industry. OKK CORP. has a $15 million
contract to deliver about 50 horizontal machining centers to an
unnamed Tier 1 parts supplier affiliated with one of the Big Three.
The buyer will use the HM60s for round-the-clock machining of
cylinder heads. Deliveries will start in May and be completed in
October. The contract is the largest that Osaka- based OKK has ever
won. .....TAIYO MACHINE WORKS, LTD. has a contract to build two
vertical CNC grinding machines for GENERAL MOTORS CORP. The Niigata
prefecture firm hopes that the $1.6 million order, its first from GM,
will lead to other business in the United States. MITSUI &amp; CO.,
LTD. represents the firm.</P>

<P>Although known as the world's dominant manufacturer of dicing saws
for semiconductor wafers, DISCO CORP. also makes industrial
diamond-tipped tools. It has moved into that expanding U.S. market
through a recently formed sales subsidiary in Athens, Georgia and a
satellite office at its Santa Clara, California dicing saw marketing
unit. Disco has an ambitious sales target for the new product line,
hoping to do $1.5 million worth of business in the first year and to
win 5 percent of the U.S. market in the future.</P>

<P>Building on its existing U.S. business of heat treating and
rustproofing automotive parts, NIHON PARKERIZING CO., LTD. has
established a subsidiary in Urbana, Ohio to market electrostatic
powder coating equipment. IONICS ENGINEERING CORP.'s line is the
GX5000 Series, which includes a pair of automatic spray units, a
control console and a spray booth. iECO also designs coating systems
for manufacturers and oversees installation and maintenance. It is
projecting revenues of $3.2 million a year.</P>

<P>This spring, KOBE STEEL, LTD. will begin U.S. marketing of a line
of made- in-Japan compact hydraulic excavators in addition to the
full-size hydraulic excavators it assembles in Calhoun, Georgia. The
three products in the Kobelco SR "Beetle" Series, which range in
operating weight from 3,700 pounds to 7,700 pounds and can dig to
depths of around 7 feet to more than 10 feet, are targeted at
contractors that now use backhoes. Kobe Steel's Stafford, Texas
construction machinery sales and customer support unit expects to
sell between 200 and 300 mini-excavators a year.</P>

<P>After pulling out of the U.S. commercial air conditioning market
in 1986, DAIKIN INDUSTRIES, LTD. plans a 1999 return. The company has
a yearlong feasibility study underway to decide which products to
introduce and how to reenter the market for what is its dominant
revenue producer.</P>

<P>Although only weeks old, graphic arts materials manufacturer KODAK
POLYCHROME GRAPHICS CO. is poised to make its first acquisition. The
Norwalk, Connecticut-based company has agreed to buy for an estimated
$80 million INTERNATIONAL PAPER CO.'s Horsell Anitec division, a
worldwide supplier of graphic arts film, plates and paper. With sales
of some $400 million a year and a work force of about 1,800, the unit
has production facilities in Binghamton, New York, Holyoke,
Massachusetts, England and Germany. Kodak Polychrome &#151; an equal
partnership between EASTMAN KODAK CO. and the SUN CHEMICAL CORP.
subsidiary of DAINIPPON INK &amp; CHEMICALS, INC. (see Japan-U.S.
Business Report No. 338, November 1997, p. 5) &#151; will take over
these plants as well as Horsell Anitec's sales, marketing,
distribution and R&amp;D operations. Before the pending acquisition,
Kodak Polychrome, which employs roughly 2,600 people, was projecting
annual sales of $1 billion or so. International Paper's decision last
summer to sell its imaging products group also proved to be a boon to
the international marketing ambitions of FUJI PHOTO FILM CO., LTD.,
which bought the company's Anchor pressroom chemicals division (see
Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 338, November 1997, p. 2).</P>

<P>An alliance between NORITSU KOKI CO., LTD., the pioneer of
photofinishing minilabs, and PICTUREVISION INC., a manufacturer of
photographic digitization systems, will offer operators of
traditional minilabs a migration path to one-hour "digitally enabled"
minilabs. The first phase of the relationship involves the
combination of Noritsu's QSS-23 CRT digital printer with the Herndon,
Virginia company's equipment and technology, including the PhotoNet
Digital System, which allows photofinishers to produce digital
products. Through this pairing, consumers will be able to use, share,
view and store their photos on the Internet or a floppy disk. In the
future, the minilab manufacturer and PictureVision will work together
to coordinate other parts of their product line.</P>

<P>In an attempt to stand out in a crowded marketplace, TOSHIBA CORP.
cut the price of its entry-level digital camera to $250 from $400. As
a further incentive to users of desktop computers, the company is
bundling a parallel port PC card reader with the PDR-2.</P>

<P>In a move that diversifies its product lines, OYO GEOSPACE CORP.
of Houston bought neighboring JRC/CONCORD TECHNOLOGIES, INC. for a
reported $4.6 million. The wholly owned OYO CORP. subsidiary, which
has expanded over the years by purchasing businesses in the same
field, designs and manufactures instruments and equipment used in the
acquisition and the processing of seismic data, primarily land-based,
for the oil and gas industry. JRC/Concord Technologies specializes in
the development and production of marine seismic acquisition
equipment. Its 1997 revenues were an estimated $5.8 million.</P>

<P>Shipments will begin this spring of what is described as the
world's smallest, adjustment-free, ultrashort-pulse fiber laser. The
femtolite 780 was commercialized by Ann Arbor, Michigan-based IMRA
AMERICA, INC., a wholly owned subsidiary of automotive parts
manufacturer AISIN SEIKI CO., LTD. Unlike previous ultrashort-pulse
lasers, which typically require frequent adjustments under normal
conditions, the femtolite 780 minimizes vibration- and
temperature-induced shifts in positioning, thereby ensuring
stability. This feature plus the compact size of the package make
ultrashort-pulse lasers practical for such applications as
high-resolution three-dimensional spatial measurements, multiphoton
imaging and semiconductor inspection. The femtolite 780 will be
priced around $120,000.</P>

<P>Effective April 1, HIOKI E.E. CORP., a midsized manufacturer of
electric measuring instruments, will start marketing its products in
the United States through a wholly owned New Jersey subsidiary rather
than a distributor. The Nagano prefecture company is projecting
first-year sales of $1.6 million. Through this move, Hioki hopes to
lessen its substantial dependence on exports to Asia.</P>

<P>HITACHI, LTD. and PERKIN-ELMER CORP. have teamed up on
electrophoresis- based genetic analysis instrumentation. The pair
will codevelop automated systems that respond to the movement of
genetic analysis from research settings to new industrial and medical
applications. Hitachi will manufacture the equipment, which will be
marketed exclusively by the Norwalk, Connecticut partner's Applied
Biosystems division outside Japan. There, the two companies will
cooperate on marketing. Hitachi brings to the collaboration its
expertise in high-throughput DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequencing
technologies as well as its strengths in precision manufacturing.
Perkin-Elmer's Applied Biosystems unit pioneered the development of
automated genetic analysis systems.</P>

<A NAME="Heading10"></A>SEMICONDUCTORS</H2>

<P>The long slide in DRAM (dynamic random access memory) prices and
corporate financial constraints have upended another Japanese-backed
memory production venture in the United States. Just weeks after
MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORP. disclosed that it was ending wafer
fabrication in Durham, North Carolina (see Japan-U.S. Business Report
No. 341, February 1998, p. 7), HITACHI, LTD. and TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
INC. announced that they were dissolving their partnership to build
16-megabit and 64-megabit DRAM chips. TWINSTAR SEMICONDUCTOR INC.,
located in Richardson, Texas, began ramping up production in 1996
just as DRAM prices started to fall. Hitachi and TI each currently
have a 36.46 percent stake in TwinStar; INDUSTRIAL BANK OF JAPAN,
LTD. and 11 other banks own the remaining shares. TI will form a
subsidiary to purchase TwinStar's assets and hire its 600 or so
employees. The partnership is capitalized at $250 million. About $500
million was spent on the state- of-the-art wafer fabrication
facility. Hitachi will take a reportedly "huge" but otherwise
unquantified charge for the liquidation in its FY 1997 financial
statement.</P>

<P>The same set of factors apparently have persuaded HITACHI, LTD.,
MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORP. and TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC. to postpone for
at least a year construction of a joint test production line for
1-gigabit DRAM chips. The three companies teamed up in early 1997 to
share the sky-high costs of developing the next-generation memory
(see Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 330, March 1997, pp. 4-5). The
$158.7 million line for testing process technology is to be built at
Hitachi's Tokyo research center. Work on it was scheduled to begin
this spring.</P>

<P>The 1993 collaboration between MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORP. and SGS-
THOMSON MICROELECTRONICS INC. on flash memories will be extended to
64-megabit parts from 16-megabit devices. The new generation of
products, targeted primarily at portable applications like handheld
computers, will combine the advantages of the DINOR architecture,
MELCO's strength, with the NOR-type expertise of Carrollton,
Texas-based SGS-Thomson. The partners also plan to advance flash
memory process technology to 0.20 micron or even 0.18 micron from the
0.5-micron technology they developed for their 16-megabit flash
memory portfolio. Volume production of 64-megabit flash memories is
set for 1999.</P>

<P>NEC CORP.'s Santa Clara, California semiconductor subsidiary and
NETWORK PERIPHERALS INC. &#151; a Milpitas, California-headquartered
manufacturer of Ethernet and FDDI (fiber-distributed data interface)
switches &#151; are cooperating on high-speed ASICs
(application-specific integrated circuits) aimed specifically at
10/100-megabit-per-second Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet switching.
The development work is taking place at NPI's NuWave R&amp;D center
in Bohemia, New York. The resulting ASIC technology will be
implemented in NPI's NuWave family, which is expected to be the first
line of 10/100/1000 Layer 2 and Layer 3, stackable,
wire-speed/nonblocking Ethernet switches priced at less than $100 per
port.</P>

<P>Gate array customers seeking fast-turn, high-performance ASIC
chips at a competitive price are the target market for a partnership
between SEIKO EPSON CORP. and CHIP EXPRESS CORP. Their codeveloped
SLP (Sea-of-Gates Laser Programmable) gate array family is
distributed in the United States by the Santa Clara, California
company and in Japan by INTEX CORP., an affiliate of TOYO INK
MANUFACTURING CO., LTD. Designed for prototyping and low-volume
applications, the SLP is a 0.6-micron CMOS (complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor) gate array line with three parts ranging from 20,000
to 100,000 usable logic gates and operating at either 5 volts or 3
volts. To bring these parts to market, Chip Express licensed its
QulCk laser micromachining system to wafer foundry operator Seiko
Epson. This technology allows gate array prototypes to be made in as
little as a day.</P>

<P>Santa Clara, California-based AKM SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., a wholly
owned subsidiary of ASAHI KASEI MICROSYSTEMS CO., LTD., has joined
two other companies to promote the SuperAMPS Sleep Mode for the new
IS-91A standard, which is designed to significantly extend the
battery standby time of analog cellular telephones. The combined
expertise of the trio will produce an analog cell phone with up to 10
times the battery standby time of today's products. AKM is
contributing its AK2336 single-chip base-band IC to the project.
AZTECH EMBEDDED SYSTEMS GROUP of Green Bay, Wisconsin brings to the
consortium its advanced call processing software, while ASPIRE CORP.
of Tiburon, California is in charge of the sleep-mode controller for
base stations.</P>

<P>The new FPA-3000EX5 deep-ultra-violet stepper is one key to CANON
INC.'s strategy of gaining a bigger share of the world lithography
market by the year 2000. Designed for volume production of
64-megabyte and 256-megabyte DRAMs and other devices employing
0.18-micron design rules, the EX5 can produce more than 90 8-inch
wafers per hour. That is a 23 percent higher throughput than the
current-generation EX4. This gain is the result of the EX5's use of
an increased-intensity excimer laser source from CYMER, INC. of San
Diego, California. Shipments will start in July.</P>

<P>TOKYO SEIMITSU CO., LTD., a manufacturer of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment and precision measuring instruments, has
merged its American operations into TSK AMERICA, INC. of Farmington
Hills, Michigan. Affected by the consolidation were distributor TOKYO
SEIMITSU AMERICA, INC. of neighboring Troy; TSK MANUFACTURING CO. of
Tualatin, Oregon, which has assembled precision equipment since mid-
1995; and Oakland, New Jersey-based SILICON TECHNOLOGY CORP., a
manufacturer of silicon wafer slicers and edge grinders that Tokyo
Seimitsu acquired in 1992. TSK America has annual sales of roughly
$50 million and employs about 125 people.</P>

<P>A consortium of two Japanese companies and two American firms will
build the first privately owned and operated underseas cable network
across the Pacific. The backers of the state-of-the-art,
high-capacity, 12,400-mile fiber-optic Pacific Cross-1 are: KDD
SUBMARINE CABLE SYSTEMS INC., MARUBENI CORP., GLOBAL CROSSING LTD.,
the pioneer in developing private subsea cable systems around the
world, and Exeter, New Hampshire-headquartered TYCO INTERNATIONAL
LTD., the parent of TYCO SUBMARINE SYSTEMS LTD., which has installed
more transoceanic fiber-optic cable than any other company. TSSL,
formerly part of AT&amp;T CORP., and KDD SCS, a subsidiary of KOKUSAI
DENSHIN DENWA CO., LTD., will construct PC-1. It is expected to be in
commercial service within 24 months, with two landing points in both
Japan and the United States. Marubeni and KDD SCS will cover roughly
half of the $1 billion cost of PC- 1, which will be able to handle
about 960,000 telephone calls at the same time and move data at a
rate of 80 gigabits per second. This capacity will be wholesaled to
companies on both sides of the Pacific.</P>

<P>Japan's fourth-largest facilities-based international
long-distance carrier is offering American carriers an alternative
way to carry their traffic from the United States to Japan. FORVAL
INTERNATIONAL TELECOM CORP. has established a subsidiary in Upper
Saddle River, New Jersey. It will build a U.S. network consisting of
DMS 250/300 switches from NORTHERN TELECOM LTD. in New York and Los
Angeles. These will be linked with Nortel switches in Japan via FIT's
capacity on the TPC-5 transpacific fiber-optic cable. FIT's Japan
network currently covers cities where 85 percent of all international
calls originate and terminate.</P>

<P>The Federal Communications Commission has licensed INTERNATIONAL
DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS INC. to provide facilities-based
communications services between the United States and Japan. New York
City-based IDC AMERICA, INC. has been providing leased-line services
across the Pacific. Competitor JAPAN TELECOM CO., LTD. was the first
Japanese carrier to win FCC permission to build its own network for
transpacific service.</P>

<P>Taking their collaborative efforts of the last five years in a new
direction, NEC CORP. and CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. tentatively have agreed
to work together to integrate voice and data networks. Their initial
goal is to deliver a full Voice over Internet Protocol-enabled
private branch exchange. At the heart of this effort is NEC's
just-introduced NEAX2400 IMX platform. It uses a new transmission
signaling protocol compatible with IP networks and Cisco's routers
and switches, thereby making it technically possible to add voice
networking capabilities to a local area network or a wide area
network without having to restructure the network.</P>

<P>Through its Secaucus, New Jersey-based PANASONIC TELECOMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS CO. affiliate, MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD. will
provide a new generation of digital telephone handsets to AT&amp;T
WIRELESS SERVICES, INC. under an exclusive two-year contract. The
handsets, which will carry the brand names of both companies, will
operate on the TDMA (time-division multiple access) standard.
AT&amp;T Wireless Services, an AT&amp;T CORP. company, is the largest
wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 2.2 million
digital PCS (personal communications system) customers alone.</P>

<P>Competing CDMA (code-division multiple access) PCS handsets
manufactured by SANYO ELECTRIC CO., LTD. will be distributed
exclusively in the United States by BRIGHTPOINT, INC. The
Indianapolis, Indiana company, the number-two U.S. distributor of
wireless communications equipment, hopes to sell 200,000 Sanyo
handsets by March 1999 and 1 million or more units in FY 1999 for
revenues of as much as $450 million. Joint production in this country
reportedly is under consideration.</P>

<P>NIIGATA SEIMITSU CO., LTD. has signed up the first of what it
hopes will be five or six distributors for it analog cellular
telephones. QUINTEL ENTERTAINMENT INC. of Pearl River, New York is
selling the product under the Quintel Cellular name. The Niigata
prefecture-based manufacturer expects that arrangement to produce
sales of 300,000 units in the first year. Through additional
distribution deals, it hopes to boost volume to 800,000 handsets
annually.</P>

<P>Like other big consumer electronics companies, MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC
INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD. will put on the market this summer a set-top box
that will enable today's analog television sets to receive digital
programming. TV stations are scheduled to start broadcasting in the
digital format in November, but the first-generation sets capable of
displaying this programming directly are expensive. Although pricing
has not been determined, set-top boxes from MEI, HITACHI, LTD., SHARP
CORP., SONY CORP. and TOSHIBA CORP. are expected to provide a more
affordable alternative.</P>

<P>A decade after its first American factory became operational,
automotive parts supplier ASMO CO., LTD. started production at its
fifth plant. ASMO APPALACHIAN CORP. is making power window motors,
primarily for CHRYSLER CORP. and FORD MOTOR CO., at a $3.2 million
plant outside Statesville, North Carolina. AAC is expected to do
$16.7 million worth of business in 1998 and $22.2 million in 1999. It
technically is a subsidiary of ASMO NORTH CAROLINA, INC., which also
is in Statesville and has made direct-current motors for automotive
applications since 1989. Asmo turns out the same product line at a
plant in Greenville, North Carolina that opened in mid-1995. It has
another factory devoted exclusively to power window motors in
Thomasville, North Carolina; that facility started in the spring of
1996. Asmo's original U.S. factory is in Battle Creek, Michigan,
where such products as windshield washer units and windshield wiper
motors are manufactured. The company projects that its five American
production subsidiaries will have combined 1998 sales of $283.3
million and will employ more than 2,000 people by yearend.</P>

<P>Expanding demand for ignition parts from the Big Three U.S.
automotive makers has persuaded MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORP. to shift
the supply of ignition coils from Japan to the United States. The
company is spending close to $31.7 million to build a plant for this
product at its Maysville, Kentucky production site, where automotive
audio equipment and engine control units now are made. The new
factory, part of MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC AUTOMOTIVE AMERICA, INC., will
be operational sometime in the second half of 1998. MELCO expects
production of ignition coils to generate revenues of $150 million
over five years.</P>

<P>Perryville, Missouri-based TG (U.S.A.) CORP. has added GENERAL
MOTORS CORP. and FORD MOTOR CO. as customers for its steering wheels.
In January, the TOYODA GOSEI CO., LTD. affiliate started shipping
steering wheels without airbags to GM for use in Pontiac and
Oldsmobile small cars. This contract covers about 400,000 cars a
year. In June, TG will begin delivering the first of what are
expected to be 200,000 airbag- equipped steering wheels a year to
Ford. Until it received the GM and Ford steering wheel contracts, the
main customers for TG's steering wheels and other interior and
exterior plastic parts were Japanese transplants and CHRYSLER CORP.
</P>

<P>Automatic transmission manufacturer JATCO CORP. has established a
marketing and engineering support subsidiary in Farmington Hills,
Michigan, replacing a Detroit liaison office that had been in
business for more than eight years. The company already is a supplier
to NISSAN MOTOR CO., LTD.'s U.S. operations. Through its majority
owner, MAZDA MOTOR CORP., JATCO hopes to win orders from FORD MOTOR
CO., Mazda's parent.</P>

<P>In an effort to expand its already considerable brake components
business with GENERAL MOTORS CORP. and FORD MOTOR CO., AKEBONO BRAKE
INDUSTRY CO., LTD. has launched work at its Farmington Hills,
Michigan engineering center on brake modules. The Big Three U.S.
automotive makers increasingly are buying such parts as brakes and
suspensions as assemblies rather than as individual parts that they
put together. Akebono's immediate goal is to be among the suppliers
Ford considers when it selects a brake module supplier.</P>

<P>Within FY 1998, KOYO SEIKO CO., LTD., which makes power steering
systems in addition to its mainstay business of bearings for
automotive and other applications, plans to set up a research base in
the Detroit area. This pending $19.8 million move is in response to
the motor vehicle industry's demands for faster responses from its
suppliers. Anywhere from 30 to 50 engineers will be hired to staff
the new center. Koyo Seiko already is building a R&amp;D center for
power steering systems and other automotive parts in Nara prefecture.
A similar facility is planned for France by the year 2002. All three
R&amp;D centers will be linked by satellite communications.</P>

<P>In its latest plan to end the the losses run up by its U.S.
operations, which now total $100 million, YOKOHAMA RUBBER CO., LTD.
will spend $23.8 million to expand onshore production capacity and to
build five distribution centers. Capacity at YOKOHAMA TIRE CORP.'s
Salem, Virginia car and light truck tire plant will be raised to 8.5
million tires a year from 7.5 million currently. About half of the
extra output will be for strong-selling sport-utility vehicles. Once
the new distribution centers in Oklahoma, Oregon, Virginia and two
other states are operational, Fullerton, California-headquartered YTC
will close four existing facilities, including ones in Texas and
Tennessee. With these changes, Japan's number-two tire manufacturer
expects YTC to be profitable in 1999.</P>

<P>TOKAI RIKA CO., LTD. has reorganized its American businesses. The
TOYOTA MOTOR CORP.-affiliated parts manufacturer made its Plymouth,
Michigan subsidiary, renamed TRAM, INC., the parent of three
manufacturing companies. These are the newly christened TRMI, INC., a
Battle Creek, Michigan maker of switches that employs 780 people; TAC
MANUFACTURING, INC., which produces steering wheels and airbag
assemblies at a Jackson, Michigan plant; and Ashley, Indiana-based
TRIN, INC., another switch maker. The new structure is intended in
part to strengthen Tokai Rika's North American design engineering
capabilities, which will include new prototype and testing
facilities.</P>

with 1997 sales of $530 million. Its 34 distribution centers, nine
packaging plants and a nail mill employ approximately 925 people. The
trading company plans to spend an additional $20 million or so to
upgrade PrimeSource's operations. Through its ITOCHU BUILDING
PRODUCTS CO., INC. subsidiary, which was formed in 1981, Itochu had
U.S. building materials sales of $120 million last year. IBP has 11
distribution centers and three packaging plants. The combined
PrimeSource and IBP will rank fifth in the industry, with projected
sales of more than $700 million in 1998. Although the two operations
will be managed separately, they will cooperate on such things as
purchasing.</P>

<P>Deciding that it wanted to concentrate at home and abroad on its
Kampo (Chinese medicine) business, TSUMURA &amp; CO. has put its U.S.
subsidiary up for sale. Secaucus, New Jersey-based TSUMURA
INTERNATIONAL INC. handles imported and domestically made bath
products, fragrances and toiletries. Its American manufacturing and
distribution operations, acquired in 1989, are located in Shakopee,
Minnesota. Tsumura International employs approximately 500 people.
</P>

<P>This summer, SHISEIDO CO., LTD. will launch a new line of
cosmetics under the 5S brand rather than the Shiseido name used for
sales of its products through department stores. The reasonably
priced products will debut at a store in Manhattan that Japan's top
cosmetics company will open. The 5S line is targeted at women in
their 20s and 30s who live in metropolitan areas.</P>

<P>For $600,000, SAILOR PEN CO., LTD. bought PDM ADHESIVES CORP. of
Fayetteville, Georgia, which had distributed the firm's lower-priced
lines of writing instruments to wholesalers. The renamed SAILOR CORP.
OF AMERICA will deal directly with retailers, the standard practice
in the U.S. office supplies business. That channel is hoped to lead
to higher sales.</P>

<P>Following four years of declining profits, NAMCO CYBERTAINMENT
INC., the largest operator of game amusement centers in the United
States, has filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. The Bensenville,
Illinois subsidiary of video game supplier NAMCO LTD. operates 370
amusement centers, mostly in shopping malls, and supplies games to
170 other locations. It reportedly will shut down around 30 percent
of its directly run centers and try to restructure the leases on the
remaining ones. New centers will be located in entertainment
complexes and will include sports simulators and other larger game
equipment.</P>

<P>The restructuring of SOFTBANK CORP.'s varied American holdings,
mostly acquired at what analysts considered a steep premium,
continues. Just weeks after selling an Internet advertisement
marketing company (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No.341, February
1998, p. 8), the company announced that it would sell through an
initial public offering $460 million worth of stock in ZIFF-DAVIS
INC. Softbank bought the world's largest publisher of computer
magazines in early 1996 for a reported $2.1 million. Other than
indicating that it would remain the majority owner of Ziff-Davis,
Softbank gave no indication what share of the company is represented
by the planned IPO. Before the stock offering, Japan's largest
wholesaler of PC software apparently plans to complete the merger of
Ziff-Davis with two of its other American units: SOFTBANK COMDEX INC.
and SOFTBANK FORUMS INC. (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 339,
December 1997, p. 9). Those two companies were merged at the end of
December. The expanded operation will be named ZD COMDEX &amp; FORUMS
INC.</P>

<P>KINTETSU WORLD EXPRESS, INC., which provides integrated
transportation, distribution and logistics services from more than 80
North American locations, opened a distribution terminal in
Carrollton, Texas. The facility warehouses and distributes ultrapure
chemicals used in the fabrication of semiconductors and related
products. .....MITSUI &amp; CO., LTD. inaugurated a distribution
facility in Houston. It handles imported generators and exploration,
drilling and refining equipment for the petroleum industry.</P>

<P>A month after the United States and Japan worked out an aviation
agreement that includes unlimited code-sharing between carriers on
both sides of the Pacific, JAPAN AIRLINES CO., LTD. and AMR CORP.'s
American Airlines announced a tie-up. Starting this fall, American
will put JAL's flight numbers on its transpacific flights as well as
on flights within North America and to Latin American destinations.
At the same time, JAL will add American's flight numbers to its
flights across the Pacific and within Japan and the rest of Asia.
Initially, the code-sharing arrangement will be limited to 15 or so
routes, but by the summer of 1999, it is expected to cover more than
100 so-called city pairs.</P>

<P>SCHERING-PLOUGH CORP. and YAMANOUCHI PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. are
all but ending their cross-marketing arrangement. Effective April 1,
the Osaka subsidiary of the Madison, New Jersey drug company no
longer will sell any Yamanouchi products. Those now include Atock, a
bronchodilator, and Elen, a drug for senile dementia. Meanwhile, the
big Japanese pharmaceutical company will stop sales of
Schering-Plough's Intron A, an interferon Alpha for C-type hepatitis,
although it will continue to market one of the firm's antibiotics in
Japan. These changes are not expected to have a significant impact on
either company's financial results since sales of each other's
products are relatively small. For example, Schering- Plough sold
$91.3 million worth of Intron A in the year through March 1997, while
Yamanouchi's sales of the same drug totaled $23.8 million. The
numbers were basically reversed for Yamanouchi's Elen.</P>

<P>Hoping to cut the time and the cost of bringing to the market a
drug it licensed from GELTEX PHARMACEUTICALS INC. for controlling
elevated phosphate levels in chronic kidney failure patients, CHUGAI
PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. will work with KIRIN BREWERY CO., LTD.
Waltham, Massachusetts-based Geltex Pharmaceuticals gave Chugai
Pharmaceutical rights to develop, make and market PB-94 (known in the
United States as RenaGel) in Japan and elsewhere in Asia at the end
of 1994. Phase II clinical trials of PB-94 are getting underway in
Japan. Eliminating excess phosphate levels in people with chronic
kidney failure is critical to preventing renal bone disease.</P>

<P>A once-a-month heartworm preventative for dogs developed by MERCK
&amp; CO., INC. is on the market through DAINIPPON PHARMACEUTICAL
CO., LTD. The world's largest maker of veterinary drugs signed the
midsized pharmaceutical firm as the distributor of its veterinary
products in 1995. For the last two years, Dainippon Pharmaceutical
has marketed Cardomek Chewable FX for feline heartworm. Cardomek
Chewable P for dogs is expected to generate sales of $7.9 million in
1998.</P>

<A NAME="Heading17"></A>COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS</H2>

<P>What it claims is the widest range of price/performance solutions
for Windows NT enterprise computing is on the market from DIGITAL
EQUIPMENT CORP.'s local operation. The unified DIGITAL Server line
brings together all of DEC's 32-bit Intel-based servers, which run
from entry- level systems to mainframe-class units, as well as its
64-bit Alpha- based enterprise servers for the Windows NT market.
Some of the products are new, including Windows NT-only Alpha-based
servers; others previously were part of the Prioris family of Pentium
Pro-based systems. For companies requiring multiple operating system
platforms, DEC continues to offer its entire line of AlphaServer
systems for Digital Unix, OpenVMS and Windows NT.</P>

<P>Broadening its offerings for the data warehousing market, NCR
CORP.'s subsidiary introduced two additions to the WorldMark server
line. The entry-level WorldMark 4700 is designed for small
information warehouses or data marts. Eight nodes, each employing
four 200-MHz Pentium Pro processors, can be clustered to create a
platform scalable up to 600 gigabytes. The massively parallel
WorldMark 5150 server is NCR's new high-end model. Scalable up to 128
connected nodes, it can handle data bases that range in size from 600
gigabytes to more than 100 terabytes. Like other WorldMark servers,
the new models are optimized for NCR's parallel processing relational
data base management system, Teradata. A fully configured WorldMark
4700 costs about $634,900, while a typical WorldMark 5150 system for
large data bases goes for $1.3 million.</P>

<P>For businesses with high-volume networks that place priority on
maximum availability, the local operation of UNISYS CORP. is touting
the Aquanta HS/6 server. This model, which starts at $43,700, can
handle as many as six 200-MHz Pentium Pro processors. The top
configuration can supply the processors required for such tasks as
clustering while still having a minimum of four available for data
processing jobs. For companies whose requirements are demanding but
not quite as stiff, Unisys has the Aquanta QS/6. Designed for up to
four 200-MHz Pentium Pro processors, its operating environment also
is Windows NT Server or Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition. Pricing
for the Aquanta QS/6 begins at $25,400. For $19,800, corporate buyers
can get a sister product, the Aquanta QS/6U, which comes with Novell
NetWare, SCO MPX and UnixWare System management software.</P>

<P>IBM JAPAN LTD. added two models to the RS/6000 series for
companies looking for a multiuser application, data base and Internet
server. The RS/6000 Enterprise Server Model H50 and its sister, the
F50, are one-way to four-way SMP systems. Both are powered by 332-MHz
PowerPC 604e RISC (reduced instruction-set computing) processors with
X5 Level 2 cache and use the AIX operating system, the in-house
version of Unix. The Model H50 is a rack-drawer unit, while the Model
F50 is a deskside system.</P>

<P>The year-old Octane series of Unix-based graphics workstations
from SILICON GRAPHICS, INC. has a powerful new member, the
Octane/MXE. The extra performance comes in part from a 250-MHz
version of the 64-bit MIPS R10000 RISC processor. It also is the
result of SGI's new GeometryEngine and its E-Series graphics, which
is said to deliver as much as a 40 percent jump in speed. Geared
toward complex design, analysis and modeling problems, the
single-processor Octane/MXE starts at $35,600, while the
dual-processor model costs $68,000 and up.</P>

<P>HEWLETT-PACKARD JAPAN LTD. also has beefed up its Unix-based
graphics workstation line with the release of the HP VISUALIZE Model
J2240. The deskside J-Class system is powered by one or two 235-MHz
PA-8200 64- bit RISC processors. To maintain its strong position in
the technical workstation market, HP Japan priced the 2D-capable
version of the Model J2240 at $52,100 and the 3D version at $67,900.
As with a number of the other products in the extended HP 9000 family
of Unix servers and workstations, HEWLETT-PACKARD CO. is shipping the
HP VISUALIZE Model J2240 on an original equipment manufacturer basis
to HITACHI, LTD., which is selling it as the Hitachi 9000V Series
Model VQ2240, and to OKI ELECTRIC INDUSTRY CO., LTD., which named the
system the OKITAC9000 Series Model J2240.</P>

<P>The market in Japan for Windows NT-based 3D workstations is
becoming crowded, but IBM JAPAN LTD. is convinced that the new
IntelliStation M Pro will stand out. Its optimism is based on the
claim of the world's fastest Windows NT 3D workstation, an
achievement attributed to the advantages of the Intense 3400 graphic
card used in the 333-MHz Pentium Pro system. The aggressive pricing
of the IntelliStation M Pro, which starts at under $4,800, also makes
IBM Japan believe that it has a winner.</P>

<P>IBM JAPAN LTD. also is protecting its turf in the market for
enterprise servers with the introduction of the Netfinity 3500.
Targeted at small and midsized businesses that want to harness the
power of the Internet and electronic business while protecting their
investment, the new system supports one or two 233-MHz, 266-MHz or
333-MHz Pentium II processors and up to 512 megabytes of ECC (error
checking and correcting) synchronous DRAM memory and provides as much
as 22.7 gigabytes of internal storage. With a starting price of
$3,700, the Netfinity 3500 also is designed to appeal to the
value-conscious firm.</P>

<P>The subsidiary of NCR CORP. is offering a Windows NT/Pentium II
server solution to its many customers in retail and financial
industries that are automating store and branch operations. These
companies also can use the dual-processor-capable NCR S26XLPII, which
starts at $9,100, as a LAN server, a file/print server or a back
office server.</P>

<P>Other companies also are hoping that servers built around powerful
Pentium II processors will attract general corporate customers in a
market where desktop PC sales are going nowhere. For instance, COMPAQ
COMPUTER CORP.'s subsidiary introduced a pair of ProLiant 1600 server
models powered by one or two 266-MHz or 300-MHz Pentium II. These
systems, priced respectively from $6,700 and $7,100, also offer 512
kilobytes of Level 2 ECC cache memory and as much as 512 megabytes of
EDO (extended data-out) ECC memory. For small and midsized businesses
looking for a feature-rich but value-priced workgroup server, Compaq
has four versions of the ProSignia 200, including one with a 166-MHz
Pentium II chip that lists for $3,000 and others with either a
233-MHz, 266-MHz or 300-MHz Pentium II. The latter product costs
$4,800. ECC memory and SCSI (small computer system interface) drive
support are standard for all four.</P>

<P>Although selectivity remains the operating strategy, a few
companies are introducing new commercial desktop systems. IBM JAPAN
LTD., for one, added four models to its year-old IBM PC 300GL series,
including units powered by a 233-MHz or a 266-MHz Pentium II
processor and a pair featuring a 200-MHz Pentium chip with MMX
technology. INTEL CORP.'s 440LX chipset is standard on all the
systems, which also offer the simplified LAN management of their
predecessors, such as INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP.'s Wake on
LAN and LANClient control Manager and Intel's LANDeskClient Manager.
The new entry-level model lists for $1,800.</P>

<P><CENTER><A HREF="#top">Top</A></CENTER></P>

<P>For its part, DELL COMPUTER CORP.'s subsidiary put on the market a
new top-of-the-line OptiPlex system. The $1,900 OptiPlex GXa 6333EM
has many of the same features as the IBM PC 300GL, including remote
LAN management and the architectural advances delivered by the new
industry-standard AGP (accelerated graphics port), but its engine is
the 333-MHz Pentium II processor with MMX technology.</P>

<P>IBM JAPAN LTD. is hoping that systems with all the multimedia
bells and whistles and the power of Pentium II processors with MMX
technology will appeal to demanding home enthusiasts, who are among
the buyers missing from the PC market. The six-model Aptiva S Series
also features a split system design, with a compact, pop-up media
console for fingertip access to the power button, CD-ROM drive and
diskette drive and storage for the keyboard when not in use. The
minitower can be placed up to six feet away. All these capabilities
come with a fairly reasonable price tag. The entry- level Aptiva S
costs around $2,500.</P>

<P>With new marketing partner CANON SALES CO., INC. (see Japan-U.S.
Business Report No. 341, February 1998, p. 12), COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP.
is ready to make another run at what in the United States is called
the sub-$1,000 home computer market. Although pricing of the Presario
2240 has not been disclosed, the Japan-tailored system will have
twice as much memory and a faster modem for connecting to the
Internet than the Presario 2210. That consumer-oriented model,
introduced last fall, reportedly met with little success. The key to
the affordable pricing of the Presario 2240 is the use of a K6
processor from ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. in place of the far more
expensive Pentium with MMX technology.</P>

<P>A K6 processor from ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. also is central
to the aggressive pricing of the Presario 1621 notebook computer that
CANON SALES CO., INC. is distributing exclusively for COMPAQ COMPUTER
CORP. The unit has an estimated street price of $2,000, but it is
going up against a number of similarly low-priced notebooks from
Japanese companies. On the plus side, sales of notebooks, which
represented more than 40 percent of PC shipments in Japan in 1997,
apparently continue to rise at the same time that the slump in the
desktop end of the market goes on.</P>

<P>HEWLETT-PACKARD JAPAN LTD. is testing the waters of the handheld
computer market with the American version of the Windows CE Version
2.0-based HP620LX before releasing a Japan-tailored product. Priced
around $1,200, the machine reportedly is the first handheld system
using Version 2.0 of the Windows CE operating system to feature a
color display.</P>

<P>By introducing a lower-priced line of chassis and starter kits
based on the CompactPCI (peripheral component interconnect)
architecture, MOTOROLA INC.'s subsidiary hopes to extend its CPX
computer platform to a broader range of industrial control and
telecommunications applications. The first two chassis members of the
CPX2000 family &#151; which incorporate a "hot- swap"-enabled
backplane that allows integrators to plan future systems upgrades
&#151; are targeted at process control, robotics, electronic imaging,
medical analysis and simulation among industrial applications and
interactive voice response, PBX adjunct processing, network servers,
protocol gateways and IP telephony among computer telephony uses.
Motorola's local operation plans to expand the CPX2000 series later
this year with models offering different levels of hardware
redundancy, fault resilience and telephony features.</P>

<P>Although PCs might not be selling well, apparently enough people
need their machines repaired to convince NCR CORP.'s subsidiary to
franchise its Quick Garage PC repair business. Operating as GLOBAL
SOLUTION SERVICES CORP., the new company starts off with 15
nationwide locations that repair machines made by APPLE COMPUTER INC.
GSS technicians will work not only on Apple equipment but PCs made by
other companies, including COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP. and IBM JAPAN LTD.,
as well. Owners either can bring in their PCs or technicians will
service the machines in their homes or offices. Five more shops are
expected to be opened within a year. GSS's executives and the
company's 80 or so former NCR employees have a 25 percent stake in
the new business.</P>

<P>Before the end of 1998, APPLE COMPUTER INC. will begin direct
sales of its products over the Internet in Japan and elsewhere in
Asia in addition to its traditional retail channels. Equipment
purchased this way will be built to order. At some still undecided
time, the company also will switch the rest of its Asian business to
a build-to-order system. .....To strengthen sales of Macintosh
equipment to graphics and publishing professionals, a key user group,
APPLE COMPUTER INC.'s subsidiary has organized a marketing team to
backstop retailers and other distributors. Composed of 20 or so sales
and customer-support specialists, the group is providing hardware and
software advice so that packages can be customized to users'
requirements.</P>

<P><CENTER><A HREF="#top">Top</A></CENTER></P>

<P>The data storage requirements of upscale department store operator
TAKASHIMAYA CO., LTD. are being handled by an automated cartridge
system built by STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CORP. Suitable for large Unix,
supercomputer and mainframe systems, the current generation of the
Louisville, Colorado company's PowderHorn can hold nearly 6,000
cartridges, providing up to 300 terabytes of uncompressed storage.
Moreover, it can exchange 450 cartridges per hour.</P>

<P>IBM JAPAN LTD. introduced two new versions of the 3527 SSA Entry
Subsystem for PC Servers, which, on its release in the fall of 1996,
was the first product to bring serial storage architecture to the PC
server environment. One disk-drive tower can store a maximum of 4.5
megabytes of data; it is priced at $3,000. The other, costing
$17,500, has a capacity of 45.5 gigabytes, double what was available
initially.</P>

<P>The Zip high-capacity removable drive from IOMEGA CORP. is
standard equipment with a new high-end Aptiva home computer from IBM
JAPAN LTD. This is the first time that IBM Japan incorporated the
100-megabyte Zip drive in any of its desktop PC products.</P>

<P>Through its subsidiary, IMATION CORP. is offering OEMs removable
SuperDisk Drives and Diskettes for notebook and desktop PCs. This
technology, otherwise known as LS-120, can store up to 120 megabytes
of data per diskette, or 83 times more than the conventional 3.5-inch
floppy, and the drive can read and write both LS-120 and 3.5-inch
diskettes. The SDD-120PCC for notebooks costs about $275, while the
SDD-120PPT for desktop systems goes for $315. Oakdale,
Minnesota-based Imation was a codeveloper of the LS-120 technology.
</P>

<P>With the market for Universal Serial Bus peripheral devices
expected to take off once MICROSOFT CORP. releases Windows 98,
PHOENIX TECHNOLOGIES LTD. teamed up with SHARP CORP. and TEAC CORP.
to develop a USB-enabled portable floppy disk drive. The San Jose,
California company supplied the synthesizable core component for the
USB function to Sharp, which integrated it into its USB/FDD chip.
That part is at the heart of TEAC's FD-05PU floppy drive. Phoenix
also provided the necessary FDD firmware for the USB interface. USB's
beauty is that it simplifies adding new disk drives and other
peripherals to a computer. It also has other advantages over
conventional serial and parallel ports, such as faster data
transmission.</P>

<P>CALCOMP CORP.'s subsidiary has developed and put on the market
what is said to be the fastest LED (light-emitting diode) plotter for
A1-size paper. The black-and-white 55424 is six times faster than the
Anaheim, California company's previous plotters and two to four times
faster than the competition's. The local Calcomp unit is projecting
that developed-in- Japan products will generate 30 percent of its
revenues in 1998 and as much as 50 percent at some unspecified time
in the future. The subsidiary has started to develop and manufacture
LED-based plotters for computer- aided design use because its parent
exited this business.</P>

<P>Extending a relationship that started with products for Europe and
then the United States, PEERLESS SYSTEMS CORP. helped MINOLTA CO.,
LTD. introduce in Japan the first color laser printer equipped with
PostScript Level 2 priced below $4,000. The Color PagePro PS,
equipped with interfaces for printing both Windows and Macintosh
documents, prints three full-color pages a minute with a resolution
of 600 dots per inch and 12 pages in black and white. The machine
incorporates the El Segundo, California firm's embedded color
controller. That uses the PeerlessPage Imaging System with a
high-performance i960 RISC processor and the Peerless QuickPrint
coprocessor to accelerate graphics, color rendering and printing
functions.</P>

<P>The 17-inch color Multiple Scan 720 display is on the market from
APPLE COMPUTER INC.'s subsidiary. Among other advanced technologies
found in this affordably priced display is software that allows users
to switch between resolution modes without restarting the computer. A
software control strip at the bottom of the screen also allows
precise and easy adjustment of the display controls, such as display
format and color depth.</P>

<P>Big Japanese computer makers continue to turn to American
suppliers for graphics accelerators for machines destined for the
local market. For instance, FUJITSU, LTD. tapped DIAMOND MULTIMEDIA
SYSTEMS, INC. to provide its AGP-based Fire GL 1000 Pro graphics
accelerator for four models in the Deskpower line. The 4-megabyte
version of the San Jose, California firm's accelerator will be used
in a pair of home desktop systems, while the 8-megabyte model is
going into two corporate desktop systems. In addition, NEC CORP.
chose for its MateServer NX servers DIAMOND MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS,
INC.'s AGP-based Viper V330 accelerator, which features the RIVA 128
3D processor from NVIDIA CORP. of Sunnyvale, California.</P>

<P>Although Japan's population is rapidly aging, senior citizens,
particularly those who need help with daily life, do not have as many
options in living arrangements as their American peers. EMERITUS
CORP., a Seattle- headquartered company that operates
residential-style assisted-living communities across the United
States, hopes to partially fill this void. It formed an equally owned
business in Osaka with SANYO ELECTRIC CO., LTD. to build
assisted-living projects. SANYO EMERITUS CORP. hopes to complete its
first residential-based assisted-living community by the year 2000.

<P>As one part of the drive to bolster its position in Japan's
nonresidential building control systems market, JOHNSON CONTROLS,
INC. increased its ownership of YOKOGAWA JOHNSON CONTROLS CORP. to 55
percent. The joint venture with YOKOGAWA ELECTRIC CORP. had been
equally owned since its founding in 1989, the same year the two
companies formed a since-dissolved 50-50 partnership in the United
States (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 337, October 1997, p. 6).
Milwaukee, Wisconsin- headquartered Johnson Controls also put on the
market the Metasys Facility Management System. It monitors and
controls not only HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning),
fire, lighting and security systems from JCI but also integrates
equipment and systems from more than 100 manufacturers. A Metasys
system, which communicates with BACnet, LonWorks and numerous other
protocols, can be customized to all types and sizes of buildings.

70 percent of the local building systems control market, is forging
new relationships. For example, it signed an exclusive, multiyear
distribution agreement with DAYTON GENERAL SYSTEMS CORP. The Dayton,
Ohio firm is a leading supplier of real-time LonWorks graphical
programming tools for interactive building control systems. This
technology helps to save energy and, in turn, reduce operating costs
in both offices and manufacturing plants.</P>

<P>The world's leading independent manufacturer of high-voltage power
supplies now has an office in Osaka to complement the one it opened
in 1995 in Kawaguchi, Saitama prefecture. SPELLMAN HIGH VOLTAGE
ELECTRONICS CORP. of Hauppauge, New York hopes that its expanded
geographic reach will boost sales of the new-to-Japan SL Series, a
family of 1 kilovolt to 130 kilovolt products that occupy two to
three times less space than comparable models. The complete line
features a resonant high-frequency inverter with proprietary controls
to provide fault-free operation in extreme transient and arcing
environments. That characteristic is key to such applications as
analytical X-ray, CPT/CRT testing, electrostatics, electron-beam
systems and capacitor charging. The pricing of the SL Series for
Japan has not been disclosed, but in the United States the line
starts at $1,615.</P>

<P>With the IEEE 1394 serial bus interface expected to be standard in
the future for transferring data between computers and peripherals as
well as consumer electronics products, AMP INC.'s subsidiary has
started to sell a pair of IEEE Serial Bus Connectors. The
four-position and six-position interconnection systems are capable of
accommodating data rates up to 400 megabits per second.</P>

<P>New on the market from SUMITOMO 3M LTD. is the 3M Lighted Guidance
Tube, which is designed to increase traffic safety at potentially
hazardous locations by providing motorists with a "line of light"
delineating the curvature and the elevation of the road. The LGT
system is housed in a clear, impact-resistant polycarbonate tube, 4
inches in diameter and 20 feet in length, that contains 3M Optical
Lighting Film. The tubes are connected to form 100-foot sections,
each of which is illuminated by a single 35-watt
high-intensity-discharge lamp activated by a photocontrol. The LGT
system is a product of the Traffic Control Materials division of
MINNESOTA MINING &amp; MANUFACTURING CO.</P>

<P>The IntelliScan family of high-speed industrial document scanners
from SIEMENS ELECTROCOM L.P. is on the market through NISSHO
ELECTRONICS CORP. One model, priced at $174,600, can process up to
120 letter-sized images per minute. The other can handle twice that
volume. This $238,100 machine is designed for environments that
process at least 20,000 documents a day. The IntelliScan system is
claimed to be the only scanner capable of both scanning images and
reading either machine type or handwriting without relying on other
specialized workstations. It also is designed to process bar codes
and patch codes and to sort and index documents based on content.

<A NAME="Heading20"></A>FINANCIAL SERVICES</H2>

<P>Nothing better demonstrates how American financial services
providers are capitalizing on both the problems of their local
competitors and market liberalization to expand their presence in
Japan than the announcement by MERRILL LYNCH &amp; CO., INC. that it
would launch a nationwide retail brokerage business this summer
staffed by as many as 2,000 ex-employees of failed YAMAICHI
SECURITIES CO., LTD. and operating out of approximately 30 offices of
the defunct company (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 340, January
1998, p. 13). The business will be operated by a new company
tentatively named MERRILL LYNCH JAPAN SECURITIES CO., LTD. It will
offer individual investors a diversified selection of financial
products, including investment trusts (mutual funds), domestic and
foreign stocks, convertible bonds, warrants and fixed income
securities. Through its existing MERRILL LYNCH JAPAN INC. subsidiary,
which employs about 1,000 people, the big brokerage house provides a
wide range of services to corporate and institutional clients. It
also is expanding its local asset management capabilities.</P>

<P>If this announcement had a rival, it was the news that GE CAPITAL
SERVICES CORP. was establishing a new life insurance company in
partnership with financially struggling TOHO MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE
CO. Each company will put up $571.4 million to form GE CAPITAL EDISON
LIFE INSURANCE CO., which will take over all new policy writing from
Japan's 12th-largest life insurer effective April 1 and hire 9,500 of
its sales agents and other personnel. The deal will give GE Capital
Services' insurance subsidiary, GE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE CO., an
instant nationwide marketing network in the world's biggest market
for life insurance at what analysts consider to be a bargain price.
Through a complex financial arrangement, GEFA, the 13th-largest
insurer in the United States, will own 90 percent of the new company.
Toho Mutual Life will continue to exist as an independent company. It
will be solely responsible for its existing policyholders' contracts
and investment assets.</P>

<P>Protests from Washington and American insurance companies have
forced YASUDA FIRE &amp; MARINE INSURANCE CO., LTD. to postpone once
more its purchase of a majority interest in CIGNA CORP.'s INA LIFE
INSURANCE CO., LTD. subsidiary (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No.
335, August 1997, p. 12). As matters now stand, the Japanese property
and casualty insurer will not boost its stake in INA Life to 60
percent from the current 10 percent until after the year 2001. That
is when the December 1996 transpacific insurance agreement will allow
the life insurance subsidiaries of Japanese nonlife insurers to
handle so-called third-sector products, which include medical
insurance policies, one of INA Life's major offerings.</P>

<P>CARGILL INVESTMENT JAPAN LTD. agreed to take over roughly $2.2
billion in loans from YAMAICHI FINANCE CO., LTD. shortly before the
YAMAICHI SECURITIES CO., LTD. nonbank finance affiliate declared
bankruptcy (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 340, January 1998, p.
14). With this portfolio plus loans it has bought from Japanese
commercial banks, the subsidiary of the world's largest grain trader
is expected to launch full- scale lending operations in Japan.</P>

<P>With Japanese banks finally starting to dispose in bulk of their
asset- backed nonperforming loans, Wall Street investment banks, U.S.
equity funds, real estate investment trusts and other American
institutional investors are picking up properties at deeply
discounted prices or are ready to do so. By one count, more than $7.9
billion worth of real estate- related bad loans was sold in 20
packages to U.S. investors in the year through March 31. Among Wall
Street heavy hitters already in the market or prepared to take the
plunge are affiliates of GOLDMAN, SACHS &amp; CO. (see Japan-U.S.
Business Report No. 340, January 1998, p. 14), BANKERS TRUST OF NEW
YORK CORP., LEHMAN BROTHERS INC., J.P. MORGAN &amp; CO., MORGAN
STANLEY, DEAN WITTER, DISCOVER &amp; CO. and SALOMON SMITH BARNEY
INC.</P>

<P>Lesser-known names also are extremely active. For instance,
SECURED CAPITAL CORP., which previously acquired three nonperforming
loan portfolios with an estimated book value of $500 million, said
that it hoped to buy $1 billion in property by the end of March 1999.
The Los Angeles company, a big purchaser of bad loans from the
Resolution Trust Corp. in the early 1990s, expects to take over
properties for just 5 percent to 30 percent of their face value.
Secured Capital also is working with CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORP.
The real estate investment unit of the New York City bank is talking
about acquiring loans worth $7.9 billion over the next year just on
its own. Secured Capital will manage these purchases and perhaps put
up some money.</P>

<P>To help these and other companies, ERNST &amp; YOUNG LLP's Los
Angeles- based E&amp;Y Kenneth Leventhal real estate unit is setting
up systems to value loans, create marketing strategies and provide
financial advisory services to both buyers and sellers of loan
portfolios. The company already has used its Japan-tailored valuation
model to assess more than $4 billion worth of nonperforming loans for
clients.</P>

<P>KENNEDY-WILSON INC., which opened a subsidiary in Tokyo in 1995 to
advise Japanese companies how to handle their real estate-related
problems at home and abroad, is doing a booming business assessing
property-backed nonperforming loans for U.S. investors. In just the
first two months of 1998, the Santa Monica, California firm's
Japanese loan acquisition division reviewed more than 250 distressed
real estate loans for clients. The group also completed and won bids
on behalf of U.S. investors for the acquisition of office buildings
in Japan. Because of the swelling demand for its services, the
largest U.S. real estate marketing and investment services company
licensed to operate in Japan is rapidly expanding its staff.</P>

<P>Sometime early in the year 2000, CITIBANK N.A. customers in Japan
will be able to switch money between their bank accounts and their
savings accounts at the nation's 20,000 or so post offices. The
arrangement is the first between a bank and the postal savings
system. Next January, Citibank automatic teller machines and cash
dispensers will be linked with those operated by the post office.
Again, the big American bank will be ahead of its local competitors.

<P>Green Giant, Old El Paso and other well-known processed food
brands owned by PILLSBURY CO. no longer are being sold by the
Minneapolis-head- quartered multinational's subsidiary. That
operation was sold to JAPAN TOBACCO INC., which also received a
marketing license for all Pillsbury products except Haagen-Dazs ice
cream. The big food products company continues to be involved in
R&amp;D and product development for the Japanese market. It also
still manufactures the products sold there.</P>

<P>With nearly two years of experience in the local market behind it,
sausage manufacturer JOHNSONVILLE FOODS INC. has switched product
strategy. It now is focusing on three varieties of uncooked frozen
products &#151; Johnsonville Fresh Raw Sausage Plain, Basil and
Mushroom &#151; rather than on smoked sausages, where there is much
more competition from Japanese companies. A package of 10 sausages is
priced around $3.10 in major supermarkets. The Kohler, Wisconsin
firm, which works exclusively with SUMITOMO CORP., expects to ship
close to 80 tons of sausage to Japan this year.</P>

<P>After stopping sales of Easy Fiber last November, the Tokyo unit
of AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP.'s Whitehall Laboratories division has
given marketing and trademark rights to the food fiber-based product
to KOBAYASHI PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. The Osaka-based drug company
expects sales to total $3.2 million the first year, or double the
business Whitehall Labs was doing in the second year of selling Easy
Fiber. Kobayashi Pharmaceutical will take over production in the near
future.</P>

<P>Samuel Adams beer has arrived in Japan. BOSTON BEER CO., INC.
signed NIPPON BEER CO., LTD., one of the top distributors of imported
beer, to handle sales of its flagship product, Samuel Adams Boston
Lager.</P>

<P>SHOWBIZ PIZZA TIME INC., the franchiser of the children-oriented
Chuck E Cheese's restaurants, now says that it will be early 1999
before any of its outlets open in Japan. The Irving, Texas company
originally hoped to have several Chuck E Cheese's restaurants in
operation last fall. The facilities will feature the same attractions
and menu as the American original.</P>

<P>Through genetic engineering, MONSANTO CO.'s local operation hopes
to commercialize a high-yielding soybean variety suited to Japan's
soils and climatic conditions for use in tofu and similar products.
Seeds for the weedkiller-resistant soybean will be brought in from
the United States and crossbred with seeds from soybean varieties
indigenous to Japan. The work is taking place at Monsanto's research
farm in Ibaraki prefecture.</P>

<P>Big formula feed manufacturer KYODO SHIRYO CO., LTD. hopes to
boost its sales in the face of declining demand with technical
assistance from AKEY, INC. The Lewisberg, Ohio company, which got its
start as a swine feed supplier, has helped Kyodo Shiryo develop a
more efficient feeding program for hogs featuring higher nutrient
values. The NT Series, planned for marketing at the end of March,
consists of seven starter and eight grower products. With this line,
hog farmers can match a pig's nutritional requirements with its age.
That precision is said to yield a 5 percent to 10 percent improvement
in the feed conversion ratio, or the amount of feed needed to produce
a specific carcass weight.</P>

<P>The Health Industry Manufacturers Association &#151; a Washington,
D.C.-based trade association that represents more than 800
manufacturers of medical devices, diagnostic products and medical
information systems &#151; has opened an office in Tokyo. HIMA will
work with the government on finding ways to care effectively for a
rapidly aging population while controlling health-care costs. Its
specific agenda includes concentrating cutting-edge procedures in
fewer facilities, improving the purchasing practices of health-care
providers, expediting product approval, introducing greater
competition in the market and reducing the cost of doing business in
Japan.</P>

<P>With its parent's purchase of the medical devices division of
Ohmeda, the health-care business of BOC GROUP PLC, the local
affiliate of BECTON DICKINSON AND CO. will take over Ohmeda's Japan
MDD operations. These include intravenous catheters for infusion
therapy as well as such critical-care products as central venous
catheters and pulmonary artery catheters. Those products complement
Becton Dickinson's. The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company
manufactures a broad line of medical supplies and devices and
diagnostic systems. Its subsidiary expects the addition of Ohmeda's
MDD division to add 20 percent to its sales, which totaled $129.4
million in the October 1996-September 1997 period.</P>

<P>In a move designed to better support its customers, VARIAN
ASSOCIATES, INC. acquired the assets of the distributor of its cancer
therapy equipment for an undisclosed price. All of CYBERNISTY CORP.'s
Varian-related operations and employees were transferred to its
subsidiary's new Oncology Systems division. The Palo Alto, California
company believes that the new arrangement also will facilitate
integration of operations with NIPPON ONCOLOGY SYSTEMS, LTD., a joint
venture between Varian and NEC FIELD SERVICE, LTD. that provides
radiotherapy services.</P>

<P>ASPECT MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC. has signed NIHON KOHDEN CORP. as the
exclusive distributor of its stand-alone anesthesia monitors. Japan's
top manufacturer of patient monitoring systems and disposable
products for hospital operating rooms and intensive care units also
will develop a module that incorporates the Natick, Massachusetts
firm's Bispectral Index technology for a patient monitoring system
that it plans to market worldwide. Aspect expects its BIS monitor to
be commercially available in Japan this summer.</P>

<P>With reimbursement approval in hand from the Ministry of Health
and Welfare, BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP. has started marketing its
Rotablator system. This high-speed, diamond-tipped rotational device
for the treatment of atherosclerosis in coronary and peripheral
arteries selectively removes atherosclerotic plaque and opens clogged
arterial passages. It is said to be especially effective for use on
complex and highly calcified lesions, a problem that is relatively
more prevalent in Japan than elsewhere.</P>

<P>After more than a year, BIO-VASCULAR INC. also received
reimbursement approval from MHW for its Peri-Strips when used in lung
volume reduction surgery for emphysema patients. The St. Paul,
Minnesota supplier says the product prevents leaks and helps patients
recover more quickly from the surgery.</P>

<P>A noninvasive glucose monitoring system manufactured by TECHNICAL
CHEMICALS &amp; PRODUCTS, INC. will be distributed and marketed in
Japan and Taiwan by DAIICHI PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. The Pompano
Beach, Florida company's TD Glucose Monitoring System uses a
transdermal patch to provide diabetics with a painless, bloodless and
fast way to monitor their glucose levels. After the patch has been in
place on the forearm for about five minutes, a compact electronic
meter is held up to the patch for an instant reading. Daiichi
Pharmaceutical will pay Technical Chemicals an up-front initial fee
and a $10 million license fee, plus royalties on sales.</P>

<P>The Lasette laser finger perforator, which is used to draw blood
for glucose and hematocrit testing in diabetic patients, will be
distributed by codeveloper CELL ROBOTICS INTERNATIONAL, INC. of
Albuquerque, New Mexico and SANWA KAGAKU KENKYUSHO CO., LTD. The
Nagoya company controls about half of the market for blood glucose
measuring strips. A handheld, battery-operated laser device, the
Lasette produces a small hole in the finger with a single pulse of
laser light. BIG SKY LASER TECHNOLOGIES, INC. of Bozeman, Montana
codeveloped the product and will manufacture it. SKK has agreed to
buy a minimum of 500 Lasettes in the first year after sales start.
</P>

<P>Life insurance companies in Japan have started to use EPITOPE,
INC.'s OraSure oral specimen collection device for cotinine testing
of applicants. Cotinine is a nicotine derivative that indicates
whether the applicant is a smoker. The Ministry of Finance's
Insurance Bureau recently allowed life insurers to charge lower
premiums for nonsmokers. The Beaverton, Oregon company received an
initial order for 20,000 OraSure devices through its Tokyo joint
venture.</P>

<P>A Kodak Digital Science DC120 Zoom Digital Camera is at the core
of the Kodak Digital Science Clinical Kit for medical use that
EASTMAN KODAK CO.'s subsidiary has on the market. Designed mainly for
recording operations, the system includes three different close-up
lenses, image management software and cables for just $2,500 for both
Windows-based PCs and Macintosh machines. The world's first
1.2-million-pixel point- and-shoot camera, the DC120 provides an
exceptionally detailed picture. It also has a color LCD so the image
can be checked before it is recorded.</P>

<P>RHK TECHNOLOGY, INC. of Rochester Hills, Michigan has tapped
ULVAC-PHI, INC. to market its scanning probe microscopes and related
products. Used primarily in research, the UHV-STM300 ultravacuum
scanning tunneling microscope costs $111,100, while the SPM1000/2000
is priced around $76,200. The Kanagawa prefecture-based distributor
is projecting sales of RHK products at $1.6 million in the first year
of marketing and double that in the second.</P>

<P>As part of an agreement to strengthen their business relationship,
LECROY CORP., a manufacturer of electronic test instruments, bought
for an undisclosed price a 4 percent interest in publicly traded
IWATSU ELECTRIC CO., LTD. The Chestnut Ridge, New York company and
Iwatsu Electric, a midsized maker of telephones and other
telecommunications equipment as well as measuring instruments, have
cooperated on the sale of oscilloscopes in Japan since the end of
1993. They now will collaborate on the development of oscilloscopes
and other measuring equipment by combining LeCroy's expertise in
digital signal conversion and Iwatsu Electric's communications
technologies. These products will be marketed worldwide by both
partners.</P>

product includes a powerful onboard computer and a variety of data
and peripheral interfaces. It is designed for laboratory
applications, including quality control, as well as for process
control in a stand-alone configuration or remote, automated control
of plants or production lines when networked. Tokyo- based OPTO

&amp; BANKING CORP. is using a pair of the Manchester, Connecticut
company's Series 9000 systems to read, image and process stock
certificates each trading day. The equipment is designed to locate
stock certificate serial numbers, which can be on any of the four
margins of intermixed document sizes, and process them regardless of
the paper-fed direction at a rate of 10,000 to 15,000 certificates an
hour. TOYO OFFICEMATION, INC., a MITSUI &amp; CO., LTD. affiliate, is
Scan-Optics' longtime distributor.</P>

<P>The subsidiary of machine vision leader COGNEX CORP. has on the
market a system for detecting optical defects and flaws on the
surface of materials on a moving web. Fine-Line is a product of the
Natick, Massachusetts company's new surface inspection systems
division, which was formed after it bought MAYAN AUTOMATION INC.
Available as either a stand-alone single camera or a multicamera
system, Fine-Line inspects the complete area of any flat material
&#151; foils, paper, films, nonwovens &#151; in continuous motion.
The single-camera configuration starts at just $31,700. Cognex is

<P>Seeing telecommunications equipment as a major growth market for
its analog integrated circuits, ANALOG DEVICES, INC. plans to more
than double the design and development division at its subsidiary's
Shiroyama, Kanagawa prefecture headquarters. Chips for modems will be
a primary focus of this work. In the year through last October, parts
for telecommunications equipment represented just 15 percent of the
Norwood, Massachusetts firm's Japan sales.</P>

<P>The latest product on the local market from LINEAR TECHNOLOGY
CORP. is the LTC1422, a controller chip that allows a board to be
safely inserted and removed from a live backplane. The subsidiary of
the Milpitas, California manufacturer of analog circuits has priced
the device at $3.00 or so in volumes of 1,000 units.</P>

<P>MOTOROLA INC.'s ColdFire family of embedded microprocessors has a
new member. The MCF5307, the first implementation of the company's
Version Three core, performs 70 million instructions per second at 90
MHz, or as much as three times more than the MCF5202. The 32-bit RISC
part also offers basic DSP (digital signal processor) functions and
expanded built-in peripherals. These features, plus the MCF5307's
aggressive pricing, should help system designers develop new
generations of high-performance, low- cost computer peripherals and
consumer electronics products.</P>

<P>A fabless semiconductor company backed by a number of Japanese
corporate investors is sampling its superscalar DSP chip in Japan.
The ZSP16401 from ZSP CORP. incorporates the Santa Clara,
California-based company's 10X DSP architecture, which applies
advanced techniques developed in the RISC microprocessor field to
digital signal processing. The part's superscalar design is said to
yield 10 times the performance available using most conventional
uniscalar DSP architectures. That reduces the number of DSP chips
required to meet increasing digital communications demands. The
ZSP16401's architecture also is claimed to simplify programming.
Production of the chip is scheduled for the second half of this year.
It will be priced at $50 per unit in volume quantities.</P>

<P>In a worldwide release, LSI LOGIC CORP. started shipping to GSM
(general system for mobile communications) wireless handset
manufacturers the industry's first customizable, single-chip GSM
baseband processor. In place of multiple chips to cover the relevant
baseband functions, LSI Logic integrated all mixed-signal functions
and digital baseband logic, including the OakDSPCore DSP and TinyRISC
processor cores, onto a single CMOS (complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor) chip. The GSM baseband processor is priced at $15 in
volume quantities.</P>

<P>The ADDZEST automotive navigation system that CLARION CO., LTD. is
introducing this spring in Japan uses the Zodiac chipset from
ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. in its GPS (global positioning system)
receiver. The two-chip Zodiac chipset provides the core of a
12-channel GPS receiver that can accurately calculate geographic
position from signals received from a network of orbiting GPS
satellites.</P>

<P>Lower-price VideoCD karaoke players are on the way, thanks to the
first single-chip controller from OAK TECHNOLOGY, INC. The Sunnyvale,
California firm's OTI-257, priced at $15 in volumes of 10,000,
combines an integrated 32-bit multimedia RISC architecture, a
multistandard TV encoder with composite and S-video output, a
full-screen, 64-color on- screen display, and a full-featured
multilingual karaoke playback function with integrated DSP supporting
high-fidelity sound effects.</P>

<P>3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC., the San Jose, California developer of the
popular Voodoo 3D graphics accelerator chipset, has a
second-generation product on the market. The Voodoo 2 Graphics
chipset, designed for systems powered by Pentium, Pentium Pro and
Pentium II processors, boasts a threefold performance improvement
over the initial Voodoo Graphics product. It also brings to PC game
players technologies that 3Dfx developed originally for arcade
customers. The AGP-capable Voodoo 2 is retailing for $300 or so.
.....INTEL CORP.'s subsidiary also has released a 3D graphics
accelerator. Priced at about $36 per part in quantities of 10,000,
the Intel 740 is AGP-capable.</P>

<P>In a wide-ranging agreement, INTEGRATED SILICON SOLUTION, INC. is
licensing certain flash memory patents and intellectual property to
ASAHI KASEI MICROSYSTEMS CO., LTD. The fabless Santa Clara,
California developer of memory products and AKM, which specializes in
mixed-signal chips, also will work together on products utilizing
technology from both companies. The licensing arrangement includes
several patents covering ISSI's FN Tunneling Flash cells, or NexFlash
technology. It allows AKM to embed these memory blocks in its
products.</P>

<P>PHILIPS SEMICONDUCTORS, INC. and HITACHI, LTD. are working on ICs
for contactless smart cards using the Sunnyvale, California firm's
MIFARE technology. That platform is said to be at the heart of 90
percent of the smart cards in use. Under the agreement, Hitachi has
unrestricted rights to produce, market and sell products based on the
MIFARE technology.</P>

locations of marketing partner LAWSON CO., LTD., a DAIEI, INC.
company, AOL hopes to reach customers all across the country.</P>

<P>As Web access spreads in Japan, so does interest in Web site
filtering software. SECURE COMPUTING CORP. of Roseville, Minnesota
has tied up with Tokyo-based LEASE ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. to localize,
market and support Smart Filter, a package that meets this demand.
</P>

<P>ADSMART NETWORK CORP., an Internet advertising company affiliated
with CMG INFORMATION SERVICES, INC., is following its parent's lead
by partnering with SUMITOMO CORP. Andover, Massachusetts-based

warehouse on the Internet using a Web browser. Infospace's scalable,
multithreaded Java server also allows firms to give secure data
access to customers and suppliers via the Internet. Mitsui is
Infospace's primary backer.</P>

<P>Hoping to make feasible on-line transactions for amounts less than
the equivalent of $3.97, DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP.'s subsidiary has
launched an electronic funds transfer system, MilliCent. The
experimental service is open to all vendors, but it likely will
appeal to software, news and music companies, which could charge
users a small fee every time they play a network game, hear a music
recording over the Internet or read a news article with their Web
browser. The system keeps track of a user's clicks and tallies the
bill at the end of a session.</P>

<P>Digital certificate software from GTE CYBERTRUST SOLUTIONS INC.
has been selected by Japan's largest consumer credit-card issuer as a
key component of its electronic commerce system. JCB CO., LTD. wants
to provide complete e-commerce solutions for establishments worldwide
that honor the JCB card as well as for its own Internet malls. GTE
CyberTrust's agent is CYBERTRUST JAPAN, INC., a joint venture between
the Needham, Massachusetts company and a number of local corporations

technical assistance. The basic fee for the software and support is
$24 a month, plus 79 cents a month per client.</P>

<P>Norton AntiVirus for Lotus Notes is a new utility for the popular
network groupware from SYMANTEC CORP.'s subsidiary. Given the large
Notes user community in Japan, the company expects 270,000 copies to
fly off the shelves in 1998, even with prices starting at $2,000 for
a 49-user setup.</P>

<P>A new network facsimile utility from the subsidiary of COMPUTER

<P>A network utility from SEAGATE SOFTWARE, INC. has been updated.
Version 7.0J of Backup Exec works closely with MICROSOFT CORP.'s
Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server to automatically back up
all data over the network. Versions of Backup Exec previously were
released for other Microsoft and NOVELL INC. products (see Japan-U.S.
Business Report No. 336, September 1997, p. 21).</P>

<P>Japanese chief information officers have the benefit of a growing
list of software options to meet their varied needs. For example,
COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP.'s local arm has sold a Concept Base Search 1000
system to JUSTSYSTEM CORP. The software maker's rapid growth has made
it a challenge to provide every employee with the latest corporate
information over its intranet. The new Compaq system avoids the need
for key word searches, relying instead on natural language queries. A
20-client Concept Base Search 1000 system costs $18,300.</P>

<P>EXCALIBUR TECHNOLOGIES CORP. released a native Japanese version of
its RetrievalWare through SONY MARKETING (JAPAN) INC. The Vienna,
Virginia firm's product uses neural network technology and adaptive
pattern recognition processing to search and retrieve all data types,

<P>Two new software packages from American companies will help
Japanese executives prepare up-to-the-minute financial reports based
on international accounting standards. IBIS21, a unique product from
UNISYS CORP.'s subsidiary, is tailored to the needs of financial
institutions facing Big Bang deregulation and liberalization. Running
under Windows NT, IBIS21 tracks all transactions according to rules
set by the Bank for International Settlements and provides
BIS-compliant reports. A basic system license starts at nearly $1.7
million. Optional add-ons cost about $1,700 and up a month. .....A
more generalized administrative and accounting package is available
from NCR CORP.'s subsidiary. By drawing data from purchasing,
production and sales departments, NCR's RAPID system generates
reports in real time using international accounting standards. The
system can be set to flag questionable transactions and postings,
helping managers maintain internal control. SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO.,
LTD. is the first buyer of the RAPID data warehouse and financial
analysis package.</P>

<P>Through its subsidiary, NOVELL INC. is shipping GroupWise WorkFlow
Professional 5.2J. The graphical version of GroupWise WorkFlow lets
users create, manage and store information about business processes.
Using a shared electronic "canvas," they can place and link icons
representing various steps or operations, institutionalizing ways to
structure, process and respond to tasks.</P>

<P><CENTER><A HREF="#top">Top</A></CENTER></P>

are projected at $4 million.</P>

<P>In conjunction with the opening of a Tokyo subsidiary, Atlanta-
headquartered MAPICS, INC. announced a Japanese-language version of
its MAPICS XA enterprise resource planning tool. MAPICS XA is widely
used by discrete and batch-process manufacturers. More than 65
companies in Japan already run the English version of MAPICS on their
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP. AS/400 platforms. IBM JAPAN
LTD., GB SOLUTION CO., LTD. and ALPS SYSTEM INTEGRATION CO., LTD. are
the company's distributors. One of the first businesses to implement
the Japanese version of MAPICS XA is OKI DATA CORP., which has

of its interactive human anatomy software (see Japan-U.S. Business
Report No. 340, January 1998, p. 24) by commissioning Japanese
versions of three medical information and diagnostic programs it
recently acquired. KAINOS LABORATORIES, INC. will localize and market
exclusively Iliad, Medical HouseCall and Pediatric HouseCall. The
Nagoya pharmaceutical company is familiar with the three packages
since it handled local marketing of them for their previous owner,
APPLIED MEDICAL INFORMATICS, INC. Iliad is an on-line and off-line
drug and medical information encyclopedia for doctors and medical
researchers. The HouseCall programs are aimed at laymen, helping them
understand medical conditions and the drugs that treat them.</P>

<P>Market newcomer VIDEONICS INC. of Campbell, California tapped
KOMAMURA CORP. to distribute its desktop video editing program for
Windows environments and its video device controller plug-in for
ADOBE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Premier video image editing package. Video
ToolKit 3.0, which lists at $475, adds Internet connectivity and the
ability to control up to seven source and postproduction devices
through one PC serial port. The $315 Media Motion 3.0 allows users to
control videocassette recorders and camcorders from within Adobe
Premier with unprecedented accuracy and flexibility.</P>

<P><CENTER><A HREF="#top">Top</A></CENTER></P>

<P>AVID TECHNOLOGY, INC. of Tewkesbury, Massachusetts has signed up a
seventh distributor of its nonlinear video editing programs.
DAINIPPON SCREEN MANUFACTURING CO., LTD. will handle both the
high-end MediaComposer, which costs anywhere from $39,700 to $95,200,
and the midrange MCXpress, which ranges in price from $31,700 to
$55,600. With its 200 sales channels, Dainippon Screen sees its
revenues from Avid programs hitting $39.7 million in the year 2000.
</P>

<P>Known for its popular screen-saver utility, BERKELEY SYSTEMS, INC.
has agreed to work with entertainment producer YOSHIMOTO KOGYO CO.,
LTD. on a local version of the award-winning "You Don't Know Jack"
trivia game. To be available for both Windows and Mac OS systems,
Yoshimoto Kogyo expects the game's quiz-show format to appeal to a
Japanese audience. It plans to amplify this appeal by using Japanese
material and the voice of a popular Japanese comedian as the game's
emcee.</P>

<P>To keep pace with operating system developments, INSIGNIA
SOLUTIONS INC. of Santa Clara, California rolled out a new, localized
version of its PC emulator for Macintosh computers. SoftWindows95 5.0
lets Mac users run Windows 95 programs more quickly and with fewer
crashes. The $350 program is available through MC PERSONAL COMPUTER
CO., LTD., a unit of MITSUBISHI CORP. and Insignia's exclusive
distributor for the last four years. Roughly 50,000 copies of the
previous edition of SoftWindows were sold in Japan.</P>

<P>Since being acquired by NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR CORP., Fremont,
California-based MEDIAMATICS, INC. has pressed ahead with its DVD
software for PCs, DVDExpress. The software encoder/decoder is
optimized for use on Pentium processors with MMX technology. It has
been integrated into Windows 95. Mediamatics is pushing Japanese
electronics makers to incorporate the software into their set-top DVD
boxes and other multimedia appliances.</P>

<P>Imaging forms and other nontext data just became easier thanks to
a new PC utility from the Japanese arm of UNISYS CORP. Entry
Key/Viewer handles things like completed application forms, sales
slips, invoices and other forms, checking automatically for errors
and problems as the data is scanned. Unisys expects to sell 1,000
copies a year of the $3,300 program.</P>

<P>SYMANTEC CORP.'s subsidiary is offering updates for three of its
popular PC utility programs: the $94 Norton Utilities and Norton
CrashGuard and Norton Uninstall Deluxe, both of which have a street
price of $54. The popularity of the Windows operating system
underpins Symantec's first- year sales projections of 400,000 copies
for Norton Utilities and 600,000 combined units for the other two
packages.</P>

<P>Close on the heels of NISSAN MOTOR CO., LTD.'s decision to make
the I- DEAS Master CAD program and the Metaphase Enterprise product
data management software from STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS RESEARCH CORP. the
heart of its global engineering and production system (see Japan-U.S.
Business Report No. 341, February 1998, p. 22), the Milford, Ohio
supplier of mechanical design automation and PDM software announced
that NISSAN DIGITAL PROCESS, LTD. will be the prime local distributor
of these products to Nissan's supplier base in Japan. The deal has an
estimated end-user value of $65 million. DIPRO and SDRC will jointly
support Nissan suppliers outside Japan.</P>

<P>Boulder, Colorado-headquartered SPATIAL TECHNOLOGY, INC. has
finalized a deal that will make its ACIS 3D solid-modeling technology
the central component of SONY CORP.'s global engineering needs. The
capability of the ACIS engineering data exchange server to work with
a wide variety of CAD/CAE/CAM systems was a key issue in Sony's
decision.</P>

<P>Targeting the large installed base of users of SolidWorks for
PC-based 3D CAD, MECHANICAL DYNAMICS, INC. of Ann Arbor, Michigan
made its add-on virtual prototyping module &#151; ADAMS &#151;
available through KUBOTA SOLID TECHNOLOGY CORP. ADAMS takes
SolidWorks designs and turns them into virtual mechanical systems for
simulation, testing and evaluation. KUSCO is the exclusive
distributor of SolidWorks, a product of Concord, Massachusetts-based
SOLIDWORKS CORP.</P>

<P>MENTOR GRAPHICS CORP. is working closely with ZUKEN INC. to
bolster both companies' CAD/CAM resources for printed circuit boards.
The Yokohama-based firm has considerable experience designing PCBs,
while Mentor brings its electronic design strengths to the table. The
two will develop PCB CAD/CAM systems for sale in Japan and Asia.</P>

<P>To meet the complex demands of designing systems-on-a-chip,
SYNOPSIS, INC.'s subsidiary has released the industry's first formal
verification tool for million-gate-plus designs, Formality. As the
number of gates in a chip's logic design has skyrocketed,
verification times by gate-level simulation have increased to
unacceptable lengths. For $134,900, Formality's static verification
solves this problem with multiple verification algorithms, powerful
diagnostic analysis, schematic debugging and integration with
synthesis-based design flow processes.</P>

<P>Separately, the local arm of Mountain View, California-based
SYNOPSIS, INC. released the latest iteration of its synthesis design
tool, Design Compiler '98. Also targeted at million-gate-plus
designs, the $76,200 DC98 features enhancements that make designs run
up to three times faster than previous efforts and that produce a 13
percent improvement in critical-path-timing quality of results.
Better overall project management also has been incorporated in DC98.
</P>

<P>As Japanese educational methods adapt to modern technology, LOTUS
DEVELOPMENT CORP.'s subsidiary hopes that its LearningSpace r2.0 will
be a part of the change. Besides providing a comprehensive set of
course creation and management tools, LearningSpace's Internet-based
ability to bring together instructors and students face-to-face
"anytime, anywhere" should appeal to academic and business users.
Lotus has priced a single- user version at $6,300.</P>

<P>Students or anyone interested in learning the basics of computer
programming will welcome METROWERKS, INC.'s latest offering of
CodeWarrior Discover Programming for Macintosh Japanese r2.0. The $22
program covers basic and advanced object-oriented programming topics
in four languages: C, C++, Java and Pascal. Plus, the package teaches
how to create programs with the unique Macintosh "look and feel." The
San Jose, California company's subsidiary is in charge of
distribution.</P>

<P>On the Macintosh software marketing front, the Japanese unit of
CLARIS CORP. will follow its parent's lead and recreate itself April
1 as FILEMAKER JAPAN INC. The new firm will return all responsibility
for Macintosh programs to APPLE COMPUTER INC.'s subsidiary and focus
entirely on developing and marketing the popular FileMaker series of
data base programs.</P>

<P>On the other side of the operating system divide, MICROSOFT CORP.
has agreed to end its poorly performing PC game venture with SOFTBANK
CORP. At some point this year, the wholesaler of PC software will buy
Microsoft's 40 percent stake in GAMEBANK CORP. and revamp the game
development company on a smaller scale. Gamebank was created in 1995
in anticipation of the release of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating
system. Although its revenues run about $15.9 million a year, the
company has a cumulative debt of roughly $5.6 million.</P>

<P>Separately, MICROSOFT CORP.'s subsidiary has struck a mail-order
software marketing pact with several firms that supply small
businesses, such as office equipment vendor ASCLE CORP. The new
partners will include Microsoft products in their catalogs. That, the
software giant hopes, will stimulate sales of upgrades and add-ons
without high marketing costs to the tune of at least $317.5 million a
year within two years.</P>

<A NAME="Heading28"></A>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</H2>

<P>Companies interested in offering employees and business partners
access to their corporate network remotely via the Internet have a
new option in a pair of extranet access switches from BAY NETWORKS,
INC.'s subsidiary. The NOC 4000 supports large organizations with as
many as 2,000 simultaneous remote users, while the NOC 2000 can
handle up to 200 concurrent remote users. These products were
developed by NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS, INC. of Acton, Massachusetts,
which Bay Networks acquired in January. They combine virtual private
networking services with authentication, bandwidth management,
routing, firewall and directory-enabled access in a scalable
platform. NET ONE SYSTEMS CO., LTD. is the exclusive distributor of
the NOC series.</P>

<P>Security-conscious businesses are the target market for ASCEND
COMMUNICATIONS, INC.'s Pipeline 220 remote access router. It is
designed for organizations that need to maintain a tightly protected
LAN for internal data transactions but want to give outsiders access
to their Web servers and other "public" resources. The Pipeline 220
connects a frame relay or a point-to-point WAN to two independent
Ethernet LANs. It uses the Alameda, California company's integrated
Secure Access Firewall to safeguard all network connections.</P>

<P>The Shadow IPserver from NETWORK TELESYSTEMS, INC. automates the
job of assigning and tracking IP addresses on corporate intranets.
The platform integrates three network services: Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol, which centralizes network configuration and
automates address assignment; Dynamic Domain Name System, which
maintains the changing mapping of names to addresses for intranet
clients; and Net BIOS Name Service, which provides name-to-address
mapping for Net BIOS-based client-server applications. Sunnyvale,
California-based Network TeleSystems tapped TERILOGY CO., LTD. of
Tokyo to distribute the Shadow IPserver. Its pricing starts at
$2,200.</P>

<P>A San Jose, California start-up funded by NEC CORP. in July 1996
turned to its founder to market in Japan its first product, a
switch-based load balancer that manages traffic flows to Web and
application servers. HOLONTECH CORP.'s HyperFlow SP800, which NEC is
selling as the C&amp;C-NET SS100e/H800, features the developer's
ClusterXL flow-control software integrated with eight-port Ethernet
10/100-megabit-per-second dedicated-bandwidth switches. By weighing a
number of variables, the product distributes incoming client requests
to the most available server. NEC has priced the SS100e/H800 at
$28,600. It expects to sell 1,000 units annually.</P>

<P>CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.'s subsidiary is marketing Local Director for
high- traffic Internet sites. The product load-balances TCP/IP
traffic across multiple servers. These can be automatically and
transparently placed in or out of service.</P>

<P>Building on a relationship that dates from last summer (see
Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 334, July 1997, p. 24), PACKET ENGINES
INC. is supplying three products to SUMITOMO ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES,
LTD. on an OEM basis. They include the Spokane, Washington firm's
G-NIC Gigabit Ethernet network interface card for 32-bit and 64-bit
PCI bus computers. Priced at $2,000, the card is said to provide
workstations and servers 10 times the bandwidth of Fast Ethernet. SEI
also is marketing a pair of FDR Gigabit Ethernet hubs, which ensure
fair allocation of 1,000-Mbps bandwidth and 12.1-gigabit-per-second
broadcast capability among ports. The FDR6t2, priced at $19,800,
includes a six-port module that provides six full-duplex 1000Base-SX
ports. The $30,200 FDR12 contains two of these modules. .....NEC
CORP. also has a Gigabit Ethernet switch on the market that it is
getting on an OEM basis from 3COM CORP. The IP8000/500, a Layer 3,
chassis-type switch, starts at $14,200.</P>

<P>The BayStack 350 Autosense Switch line from BAY NETWORKS, INC. has
been expanded. In addition to the BayStack 350F-HD, a switch with 24
10/100-Mbps ports plus two 100Base-FX ports for high bandwidth
traffic to the network core (see Japan-U.S. Business Report No. 341,
February 1998, p. 24), the company's local operation is marketing a
stripped-down model that just provides the 24 10/100Base-TX ports.
The BayStack 350T-HD lists for $5,400.</P>

<P>The subsidiary of Largo, Florida-based PARADYNE CORP. has an April
introduction date for a xDSL modem, which allows a regular telephone
line to be used for both high-speed data transfers and conversations.
The Hot- Wire MVL can transmit data at speeds of up to 788 kilobits
per second. In the fall, the company plans to cut the modem's price
to what it is in the United States now &#151; about $300.</P>

<P>As part of a global introduction, MINNESOTA MINING &amp;
MANUFACTURING CO. launched the Volition-brand Fiber Optic Cabling
System in Japan through affiliate SUMITOMO 3M LTD. This product, 3M
says, addresses the criticism that fiber-optic cabling is too
expensive, fragile and complex to deploy to the desktop despite its
ability to ease a LAN's bandwidth constraints. At least in the United
States, the Volition system is priced at half the cost of current
fiber-optic cabling solutions.</P>

<P>GENERAL DATACOMM, INC.'s subsidiary has a product on the market
that it says finally delivers to service providers and enterprise
users the original promise of ATM (asynchronous transfer mode)
technology &#151; the ability to handle video, data and voice traffic
over a single platform &#151; while cutting voice network costs by as
much as half. The APEX VSM, short for voice service module, is a
standards-based voice over ATM product that offers both
standards-based variable-bit-rate and constant-bit-rate capabilities
in a single hardware platform. Pricing is open, but in the United
States the Middlebury, Connecticut company started the APEX VSM at
$12,000 at release last fall.</P>

<P>Over the next two years, the local operation of UNISYS CORP.
expects to sell 300 of what in the United States is called the FBA
Call Center. This Windows NT-based solution, designed to help banks
create an advanced call center operation, integrates computer
telephony components, data bases and customized applications
software. The computer telephony integration software comes from
Unisys partner GENESYS TELECOMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES INC. of San
Francisco. A 12-line FBA Call Center costs $95,200, while a system
with 48 lines goes for around $222,200.</P>

<P>A Washington state start-up that is proposing a mobile
communications system using less-expensive blimps as relay stations
in place of low- earth-orbit satellites has attracted the attention
of TOMEN CORP. The trader plans to launch the service in Japan after
the year 2001, which is when SKY STATION INTERNATIONAL INC.
anticipates starting operations in the United States. Floating
roughly 12 miles above earth, each airship is expected to cover a
310-mile radius and serve 350,000 customers.</P>

<P>Within a year, FUJITSU, LTD. will take a 25 percent stake in what
now is the wholly owned subsidiary of Palo Alto, California-based
WEBTV NETWORKS INC. WebTV Network service, which enables people with
the appropriate set-top box to access the Internet through their
television sets, began in Japan last December.</P>

<P>Direct satellite broadcaster DIRECTV JAPAN INC. continues to line
up heavyweight investors. The latest is leasing company ORIX CORP.,
which will invest about $1.6 million in the business in April.
DIRECTV INTERNATIONAL INC., part of HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORP., remains
the single largest shareholder in DirecTV, which launched a
63-channel service at the beginning of December.</P>

<P>NISSAN TRANSPORT CO., LTD. now is handling all
transportation-related operations for CHRYSLER JAPAN SALES LTD.
vehicles. The NISSAN MOTOR CO., LTD. affiliate is in charge of
everything from overseeing the unloading of Chrysler sport-utility
vehicles, minivans and cars from ships to delivering them to dealers.
At the end of last year, CHRYSLER CORP. ended its distribution
agreement with HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD. on Jeep products (see Japan-U.S.
Business Report No. 337, October 1997, p. 25). Sales of Chrysler
vehicles dropped 10.7 percent in 1997 to 14,432 units.</P>

<P>American automotive parts suppliers see the chance to do more
business with Japan's vehicle manufacturers if car and truck
producers move toward modular assemblies. In this production system,
parts suppliers build sections of a vehicle and deliver these modules
to the final assembly plant. ITT CORP.'s ITT Automotive unit, a major
supplier of brake systems, opened a wholly owned subsidiary in Tokyo
as part of its effort to boost annual sales to local vehicle makers
to $555.6 million in three years from roughly $79.4 million in 1997.
From its new base, ITT Automotive will explore joint development
possibilities with NISSHINBO INDUSTRIES, INC., its partner in the
area of antilock braking systems. The Tenneco Automotive unit of
TENNECO, INC., which already has a Japanese subsidiary, is scouting
prospective partners for collaborative development of such parts as
shock absorbers. It also plans to strengthen the development
capabilities of its subsidiary in the area of modular systems.</P>

<P>In April, BRIDGESTONE CORP. will start marketing Firestone
Wilderness radial tires for four-wheel-drive vehicles. Japan's top
tire manufacturer owns Nashville, Tennessee-headquartered
BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE, INC., the maker of the Firestone brand of
tires.</P>

<P>Although the civilian version of BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON INC.'s
tilt- rotor aircraft still is in the engineering design stage,
distributor MITSUI BUSSAN AEROSPACE CO., LTD. signed a preliminary
agreement to buy three of them. The Bell Boeing 609 is a
six-to-nine-passenger plane that combines the vertical takeoff and
landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and the range of
a turboprop plane. Depending on the configuration, the aircraft will
cost between $8 million and $10 million.</P>
