<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Whether you look in Dutch, 
French, German, English, American, or South-African newspapers, there is almost 
no information available about the 1001 Club, or, as it is often referred to, 
the '1001 Nature Trust' and '1001: A Nature's Trust'. Even in the Netherlands, 
where Bernhard's involvement with Bilderberg should be widely known by now, 
absolutely no one has heard of his role in creating the 1001. The only official 
information available about this club is that it was established in the early 
seventies by individuals like Prince Bernhard, Prince Philip, Charles de Haes, 
and Anton Rupert and that every member paid a one time fee of $10,000 to get 
lifetime membership. That's about it. </font></p>

</font><span class="style1"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFCC99">The strangest 
club in the world? - Agha Abedi, Salem Bin Laden, Gyanendra Dev with Prince 
Philip, Sadruddin Khan, Mortimer Bloomfield, and Prince Johannes von Thurn und 
Taxis.</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1948, the International 
Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) was erected, 
mainly by Sir Julian Huxley, a famous biologist. Later, on September 11, 1961, 
Julian Huxley officially established the WWF, together with people like Prince 
Bernhard and Prince Philip. Ten years later, around 1971, WWF officials Anton 
Rupert, Prince Philip, and Prince Bernhard came together and decided to form a 
club that would generate an independent source of income for the WWF. Anton 
Rupert is said to have been the one who came up with the idea. Bernhard became 
the 'figurehead', just as Joseph Retinger's secretary described his role in the 
creation of Bilderberg. Bernhard was well liked, knew many people on both sides 
of the Atlantic, and as a prince, he was considered neutral. Anton Rupert 
appointed the Belgian economist Charles de Haes as Bernhard's personal 
assistant. These two approached most of the individuals that would be invited to 
the 1001 Club. In 1974, all the members were recruited, each of them having paid 
the one-time contribution of $10,000. From this point on, we have very little 
information about how the club organizes its meetings and how much each of the 
members keep contributing. In 1980, Private Eye magazine wrote
<span class="style4">(1)</span>: </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFCC99"><em>&quot;The puzzling question 
is what do the '1001' get for their money apart from private prestige and the 
privilege of dining with Prince Bernhard or the Duke of Edinburgh?&quot; </em></font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This is the only reference 
I (initially) found that talks about this club actually arranging meetings. The 
mentioning of diners seems to indicate the 1001 Club is organized in the same 
way as the Pilgrims Society, which arranges diners two or three times a year 
with several hundred members attending at a time. With every diner you have 
several guest speakers that are invited. Of course, if the 1001 Club has been 
set up in the same way is only our best guess. One thing we do know is that new 
members were still invited in 1996. On the website of Buttonboss Plc. we can 
read in their history section: </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFCC99"><em>&quot;Buttonboss celebrated 
its 20th Jubileum and, once again, Prince Bernhard honoured us with his presence 
in attending the spectacular celebration party in Twente (Holland). It was on 
this occasion that he, in name of fellow members of the selection committee, 
offered Henk Brusse membership of the &quot;1001-Club&quot;, for which he was responsible 
in founding. This club compromises 1001 good friends and relations of H.R.H. 
Prince Bernhard, all of whom support the world-wide activities associated with 
the World Wild Life Nature Fund.&quot; </em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It took some time and a lot 
of emailing, but on August 10, 2005 the Dutch branch of the WWF finally 
confirmed that meetings are still going on to this day (translation):</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFCC99"><em>&quot;I received your 
question about the 1001-Club. Regular meetings indeed do take place. The 
location is different every time. For instance, last April there has been a 
Panda Ball in Monaco and a diner in Barcelona.</em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFCC99"><em>... Could you please 
inform me why you are interested in this information?&quot;</em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In my email I asked if the 
meetings were held in London. The WWF employee said it is very likely that 
meetings have been organized there too. Besides the fact that this time I 
actually received an answer that was helpful, what is very interesting is that 
the information was given to the WWF headquarters in Switzerland, because a 
short time after I replied to her email (to thank her and to explain my 'casual' 
interest), WWF Switzerland became very interested in my website. I never said I 
had a site so it's obvious someone within the WWF either looked up my name on 
the internet or did a search on the 'Pilgrims Society' which I mentioned in my 
email. As far as I can see, my site only received visitations from the WWF's 
headquarters and not from the Dutch branch I sent my email to. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
<img height="230" src="WWF_Swiss_visited_site_after_question_to_Dutch_WWF_no_site_given.gif" width="442"><br>
</font><font face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0"><span class="style1">It seems the 
WWF isn't used to questions about the 1001 Club. It took WWF UK five<br>
weeks to reply and WWF Belgium three weeks. According to the Dutch Branch of the 
WWF<br>
questions should normally be answered in two days. When WWF Holland finally 
replied,<br>
the Swiss HQ immediately visited my site, without me ever having contacted them 
or<br>
having mentioned I had a site.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">3 days after I uploaded the 
initial 1001 Club article and 5 weeks after I sent them an email WWF UK finally 
decided to reply. They confirmed the 1001 Club is still organizing meetings and 
added to it that the one-time introduction fee has been increased to $25,000.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><em>&quot;I have been in 
discussions with our major support section in order to find all the information 
that you require about the 1001 club. There is a one off membership fee of 
$25,000 (US Dollars) and there are field trips and events organised mainly by 
WWF International. If you have further queries please come back to us...&quot; </em>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This short message took 
them 5 weeks! And why did this person have to go in &quot;discussions&quot; to receive 
&quot;all this information&quot;? Needles to say I did get back to them and asked if the 
regular staff actually knows about the 1001 Club or if all this information is 
held behind closed doors within the WWF headquarters. On September 5, 2005, I 
received the answer. If we skip the usual apology for the delay, the whole email 
reads:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><em>&quot;I would like to inform 
you that the 1001 Club is a scheme run by WWF-International, which is situated 
in Switzerland, and for detailed information we have to contact WWF-International.&quot;
</em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As expected, the answer 
doesn't tell us a whole lot. Anyway, if you have a thousand members with an 
average age of 45-50 years or so, you'd expect that at least an average of about 
20 people die each year. 20 new members who each pay the $25,000 introduction 
fee is a baseline income for the 1001 Club of at least $500,000 annually.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">An obvious difference 
between the Anglo-American Pilgrims Society is that members of the 1001 Club are 
recruited from all over the world. You have Edgar Bronfman and Maurice Strong 
from Canada, Henry Ford and Robert McNamara from the United States, Antenor 
Patino and Gustavo Cisneros from Latin America, Sir Peter Cadbury and Lord 
Buxton from the United Kingdom, Hilmar Reksten and Alf Bjercke from Norway, 
Prince von Thurn und Taxis and Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza from Germany, Mobutu 
S�s� Seko Nkuku wa za Banga (don't you just love that name) and Salay Edu from 
Africa, Mohammed Al-Naki and Agha Abedi from the Middle-East, Gyanendra Dev from 
Nepal, and Sir Kenneth Fung and Sir Y.K. Pao from Hong Kong. But what's the 
purpose of all these people meeting? According to the afore mentioned 1980 
article in Private Eye:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><em>&quot;The answer lies in the 
fact that the WWF International, in the cause of conservation, is increasingly 
shaking hands with economic and environmental ministers from Third World 
countries who control the important resources and markets which industrialists 
so desperately need. Under the guise of the WWF, businessmen can casually meet 
politicians who share their view that what is good for business is good for bank 
accounts.&quot;</em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">20 years later, Dutch 
Attorney J. Wilgers explains to us how the IUCN and the WWF, according to his 
own research, have been created as fronts for British neo-colonialism 
(translation) <span class="style4">(2)</span>:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><em>&quot;In 1948, the IUCN, the 
International Union for the Conservation of Nature, was established. The most 
important person involved was Julian Huxley. This IUCN had a close working 
relationship with the British Colonial and Foreign Office. All his life Huxley 
had been working on projects related to the conservation of nature. In 1960, he 
made a trip through the British colonies that were about to become independent. 
He made sure that the British government was able to keep their hold on the 
nature reserves located in the countries of the Commonwealth, even today. 
Somehow he was able to convince the new African leaders that every person from 
Africa was a natural born poacher. </em></font></p>

    Commonwealth and the protection of the unlimited supply of it. It is 
    noteworthy that the IUCN still has the affix, &quot;for natural resources&quot; 
    [International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]. I 
    also point to the fact that the IUCN is an extension of the government 
    offices and the public sector of the United Kingdom, because in the end, 
    these are the real beneficiaries. A year after Huxley's trip, the WWF was 
    established with the sole purpose of gathering funds for the IUCN. The IUCN 
    went to the background at the moment the WWF came into existence... </em>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><em>30 years later, the WWF 
controls 10% of the world's surface. They control 40% of Tanzania. At the moment 
they are focused on South-America. This is something of the last 5 years [since 
1994-1995].</em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><em>There are 2 types of 
parks: nature parks and strategic parks. The official purpose of the nature 
parks is the protection of nature. Often, these parks contain important minerals 
like diamond or uranium. Locals are encouraged to leave or simply chased away. 
Type 2 are the strategic parks. If you look carefully you'll find that these 
parks are either located on certain ridges useful for military observation, or 
they are border transcending parks like for example those in South-Africa and 
Mozambique... It is remarkable that corridors have been projected in such a way 
that they cleverly combine the preservation of nature with the gaining of a 
military advantage...</em></font></p>

</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><em>It is known that in the 
past SAS units of the British army have been flown into South-Africa and were 
stationed on territory controlled by the WWF with the purpose of conducting 
military operations... Military units have been trained in these kinds of parks 
and were later brought in connection with murders in the South-African 
townships. In the Zambezi-Valley, members of the military wing of the ANC have 
been shot at from WWF helicopters. The Zambesi-Valley was the primary entrance 
into South-Africa. Under the cover of fighting poachers ANC members have been 
executed without any form of trial. I call that an undeclared war or genocide.&quot;
</em></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Wilgers is talking about 
one and half million deaths, most of them ANC members. He cites a 1989 
Commonwealth report for that number. A second wave between 1990 and 1995 killed 
about 10,000 people <span class="style4">(3)</span>. These so called 'strategic 
parks' don't seem to be limited to Southern Africa. For instance, if you take a 
look at Pakistan, our 'ally' in the War on Terror, you'll see 5 major national 
parks in the north of the country. One is located at the border with India, 
another at the border with China, and yet another one at the border with 
Northern Afghanistan. The management of these parks is working closely together 
with the IUCN and the WWF. The Aga Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) of 1001 
Club member Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan is another partner in many of the same 
projects in that area. I don't know if these parks are used to conduct some type 
of military operations, but they sure are conveniently located and fit right in 
with the words of J. Wilgers. </font></p>

geographic information can be found at the websites cited.</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">
</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Wilgers was persecuted by 
the WWF for making public statements that the World Wide Fund for Nature is a 
criminal enterprise. Unfortunately for the WWF they lost this case, although 
they never had to admit Wilgers was right. Wilgers wasn't &quot;knowingly speaking 
untruths&quot; or something like that. I guess you have to be an attorney to 
understand that kind of stuff. Years later, I made a call to mr. Wilgers, who 
told me the 1001 Club is directed by the Privy Council and MI6, which now turns 
out to be incredibly similar to the leadership of Le Cercle. The last 3 chairmen 
of Le Cercle were Privy Councilors and deeply involved with British and foreign 
intelligence. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A lot more has been written 
about the policies of the World Wide Fund for Nature and their intelligence 
service TRAFFIC, but to me the real concern is too find out what the purpose of 
the 1001 is, who its members are, and how its meetings are organized. When you 
take a look at the limited and in part outdated membership list I've been able 
to compile, you'll find the leaders and founders of the nature organizations 
below. Can you imagine how many represented organizations we might find if the 
entire list is available? </font></p>

    a month after the 1982 massacres, Sharon held meetings�in the Chouf 
    Mountains of Lebanon and at his Negev ranch�with Falange leader Camille

    the &quot;Landscam&quot; West Bank real estate grab forward. On Nov. 15, 1982, a final 
    meeting took place on several real estate purchases, mostly through Arab 
    middle-men, to push the massive expansion of Jewish settlements throughout 
    the West Bank�at a handsome profit. Attending the meeting at Sharon's ranch 
    were: Kissinger, Lord Harlech (Sir David Ormsby-Gore), Prince Johannes von 
    Thurn und Taxis, Tory Parliamentarian Julian Amery, Sir Edmund Peck, and MI6 
    Mideast mandarin Nicholas Elliot. &quot; </em>I could be wrong, but I never heard 
    EIR, Joseph Brewda, or pretty much anyone else talk in any detail about Le 
    Cercle. In the meantime I found out that Julian Amery was the chairman of 
    this secret intelligence group and Nicholas Elliot was another important 
    member. Amery's father was a hugely important Zionist. Look at the article 
    about Le Cercle for all the details. Of course it's no surprize that 
    Kissinger is said to have been a member too. By the way, last year the 
    prince's favorite fashion designer, Rudolph Moshammer, was found dead in a 
    suburb of Munich with a phone cord tied around his neck. This person was

        by wealthy individuals like Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan. The bank's 
        early growth was concentrated in the Gulf region, where Abedi could take 
        advantage of his contacts. The bank had been only a year old when the 
        oil embargo started (October 1973), but already it was operating in four 
        Gulf states and had opened offices in the immigrant neighborhoods of 
        London. Between 1973 and 1974, BCCI branches began popping up in much 
        fancier neighborhoods of London. Bank of Credit and Commerce 
        International SA was registered in the Caymans in 1975. It functioned as 
        the principal banking subsidiary of BCCI Holdings SA, which had been 
        established in Luxembourg in 1972. Beneath these two umbrella groups,

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">The history of Fiat begins with his 
        grandfather, Giovanni Agnelli. In 1899, Giovanni signed a contract with 
        Emanuele Bricherasio di Cacherano, an eccentric Turinese nobleman 
        looking for investors, as a partner in Fiat. Giovanni managed to become 
        the majority shareholder in 1906, but supposedly through illegitimate 
        means. A long judicial battle would follow until May 1912, when Giovanni 
        was acquitted of the charges. The company started to make large profits 
        in the wake of WWI due to all the domestic and foreign military orders 
        it received. In 1918, Agnelli published a book entitled 'European 
        Federation or League of Nations', arguing for a federalist Europe as 
        antidote to destructive nationalism. Eduardo Agnelli, his son, died in a 
        plane crash in 1935. The wife of Eduardo (Gianni's mother), who died in 
        a car accident in 1945, was Virginia Bourbon del Monte, daughter of the 
        Prince of San Faustino and an American named Jane Campbell. The elder 
        Giovanni died 3 weeks later. </font>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Gianni was born in 1921 in 
        Turin, Italy. He graduated in Law from Turin University. During World 
        War II he served as a Cavalry Officer in the Italian Expeditionary Force 
        on the Russian front, with the &quot;Lodi&quot; Tank Reconnaissance Unit in 
        Tunisia and in the &quot;Legnano&quot; Division of the Italian Liberation Corps. 
        For his conduct in Tunisia he was awarded the War Cross for Military 
        Valour. Became president of Juventus (soccer club) in 1947 and over the 
        eight years of his stewardship oversaw the establishment of Juventus as 
        the powerful force in Italian and European football that it is today. In 
        1955 Giovanni Agnelli married Marella, daughter of Prince Caracciolo di 
        Castagneto and Margaret Clark. Joined Fiat in 1943 as vice chairman. In 
        1957 David Rockefeller paid a visit to Italy and met with Agnelli. The 
        two became friends and several years later David invited Agnelli to the 
        newly created International Advisory Council of Chase Manhattan. He was 
        appointed managing director of FIAT in 1963. Became managing director, 
        chairman, and principal shareholder of Fiat in 1966. As head of Fiat, he 
        oversaw 4.4% of Italy's GNP, 3.1% of its industrial workforce, and 16.5% 
        of its industrial investments in research. He opened factories from 
        Russia (at the time Soviet Union) to South America, and started 
        international alliances and joint ventures (like Iveco) which marked a 
        new industrial mentality. In 1970, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger met 
        Agnelli at Hotel Quirinale in Rome. After this meeting Kissinger and 
        Agnelli became good friends. In 1973 Agnelli helped with the creation of 
        the Trilateral Commission. According to Adnkronos, Agnelli was friends 
        with Giscard d'Estaing, the Rothschild family and Lord Carrington, 
        Katherine Graham, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Felix Rohatyn, senator Ted 
        Kennedy, the writer Truman Capote, Andy Warhol, and international 
        architects as Renzo Piano, Kenzo Tange, Norman Foster, and Frank O. 
        Gehry. Zbigniew Brzezinski was another influential person he often met 
        with. Chairman of the family�s financial company, the Istituto 
        Finanziario Industriale, the Exor Group SA, the Giovanni Agnelli 
        Foundation, and La Stampa publishing company. He was also on the board 
        of Credito Italiano and of the Mediobanca and was a member of the 
        international committee of Chase Manhattan Bank (until a few years 
        before his death). In May 1974 he was elected chairman of the 
        Confederation of Industry (Confindustria), a position he held until July 
        1976, when he handed over to his chosen successor, Guido Carli, a former 
        Governor of the Bank of Italy. According to Italian sources, Agnelli was 
        a co-founder of the European Round Table in 1983 (Umberto Agnelli, his 
        younger brother, was one of the original members), together with Pehr 
        Gyllenhammar and Etienne Davignon, both also close to Kissinger, 
        Rockefellers, and the Rothschilds. Named senator for life in 1991 and 
        subscribed to the independent parliamentary group. Later named a member 
        of the senate's defence commission. Honorary vice-president of the 
        Association for the Monetary Union of Europe anno 1998, which was 
        co-founded by Etienne Davignon and brought us the EMU. Member of the 
        International Advisory Board of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
        Honorary chairman of the Council for Relations between Italy and the 
        United States. Correspondent member of the Academy of Moral and 
        Political Science of the Institut de France and a member of the 
        Chairman's Council of the (Rockefeller's) Museum of Modern Art in New 
        York (at least in 1999). Trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim 
        Foundation. Stood down as chairman of FIAT in 1996. Giovanni Alberto 
        Agnelli, the eldest son of Umberto Agnelli, was the first person to be 
        pointed out as Giovanni Agnelli's successor, but died in 1997 of a rare 
        form of intestinal cancer, age 33. His only son, Edoardo, who wasn't 
        interested in making cars, committed suicide on November 15, 2000 by 
        jumping off a bridge in Turin; Gianni himself joined the police at the 
        scene. The Agnelli family was one of the largest investors in 
        Rockefeller Center until 2001, together with David Rockefeller, Goldman 
        Sachs, and Stavros Niarchos. At that point the Speyer and Crown families 
        took over, both closely connected to the Rockefeller interests. Agnelli 
        was a member of the 1001 Club, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg 
        steering committee, the European Round Table, and a governor of the 
        Atlantic Institute for International Affairs. Died in 2003. John Elkann 
        (ERT member) is expected to become the new head of the Agnelli interests 
        in the coming years.</font></td>

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Son of the 1st Lord Beaverbrook 
        (1879-1964) who lived in Canada. The elder William Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Aitken, 
        the 1st Lord Beaverbrook, became a stockbroker and by 1910 had made a 
        fortune from Canadian cement mills. Went on to become a conservative 
        member of Parliament who visited the Western front during WWI. David 
        Lloyd George granted Aitken the title Lord Beaverbrook in 1918, and 
        appointed him as Minister of Information that same year. During the war 
        Beaverbrook acquired a controlling interest in the Daily Express. 
        Beaverbrook immediately set about a coordinated British propaganda 
        programme, responsible for the dissemination of war information at home, 
        among Allies and in neutral countries. His close colleague, Lord 
        Northcliffe, meanwhile was responsible for directing propaganda towards 
        the populations of enemy nations. Turned the Daily Express into the most 
        widely read newspaper in the world. Founded the Sunday Express in 1921. 
        Purchased the Evening Standard in 1929. An employee of Lord Beaverbrook 
        was Sefton Delmer, who was sent to head the German Daily Express office 
        in the early 1930s. Here Delmer became a friend of Ernst Roehm, who 
        arranged for him to become the first British journalist to interview 
        Adolf Hitler. In the 1932 general election Delmer travelled with Hitler 
        on his private aircraft. In 1933 he was also with Hitler when he 
        inspected the Reichstag Fire. Delmer returned to England in 1940 and 
        joined the SOE in its fight against the Nazis. Before and during the 
        initial stages of WWII, Beaverbrook was a strong supporter of 
        Anglo-German Peace, which also included Sir Harry Brittain, Lloyd 
        George, Lord Halifax, Rab Butler, the Duke of Hamilton (royal 
        housekeeper; the one Nazi second-in-command Rudolf Hess tried to reach 
        in May 1941), Sir Nevile Henderson, Sir Samuel Hoare, and seemingly also 
        some senior MI6 figures. Operation Dynamo was completed on June 4, 1940 
        and Hitler just allowed the British and French forces to escape back to 
        England. Informed historians like the well-connected Sir Basil Liddell 
        Hart (interviewed Nazi generals and knew many important people in the 
        British government) have written that Hitler did not want war with the 
        British Empire, because at least in the initial stages of the conflict 
        the British Empire would devour too many resources to maintain. The 
        earlier mentioned Sefton Delmer wrote in his 1962 book 'Black 
        Boomerang':<em> &quot;Beaverbrook had paid several visits to Berlin between 
        1935 and 1939 and on each occasion he had talked at length with Hitler 
        and Hess. They were talks in which Hitler, sometimes in the presence of 
        Hess, had gone out of his way to impress his British visitor with his 
        essential reasonableness and good sense. Not without some success, as 
        was shown by Beaverbrook's refusal to believe in 1939 that Hitler could 
        be so foolish as to forego the immense gains that avoidance of war would 
        certainly have brought him... In neutral Switzerland, the Aga Khan had 
        told Ribbentrop's amateur agent, Prince Max Hohenlohe, that Lord 
        Beaverbrook was all for peace and compromise with Hitler. 'Beaverbrook,' 
        so the Prince in a letter to the German Foreign Office on July the 25th, 
        igq.o quoted the Aga Khan as saying, 'is the only man who has the 
        courage, the power and the standing to bring about a change in England 
        even against Churchill, since Churchill has for a long time been in 
        Beaverbrook's pay.'&quot; </em>Minister for Aircraft Production 1940-1941. On 
        September 9, 1941 Beaverbrook first met with Rudolf Hess (Delmer): <em>
        &quot;Dressed, as ever, in his sober blue serge suit he walked into Hess's 
        sick room, flung his soft black hat on a table and advanced towards Hess 
        with the outstretched hand and wide cheery smile of an old friend. It 
        was the very opposite to the frozen formality of Lord Simon... Hess now 
        stated that the object of his flight to Scotland had been to make peace 
        with Britain &quot;on any terms&quot;, providing that Britain would then join 
        Germany in attacking Russia. It was an odd statement for him to make in 
        view of the fact that he had not mentioned the coming attack on Russia 
        with so much as a word when he had his talk with Lord Simon. And to 
        Kirkpatrick he had denied point blank that Hitler meant to attack 
        Russia. Nor had the terms he put down in writing at the time of his talk 
        with Lord Simon suggested Germany's readiness for peace with Britain &quot;at 
        any price&quot;... Hess's main theme was that the British were wrong if they 
        hoped that the conflict with the Soviet Union would so weaken both 
        Russia and Germany that at the end of it Britain's 19th-century hegemony 
        over Europe would be restored... 'world domination awaits the Soviet 
        Union in the future, if her power is not broken now', Hess said.&quot;</em>

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Son of Moses Annenberg, publisher 
        of The Philadelphia Inquirer. Born in 1908. The story of Moses &amp; Max 
        (older brother) Annenberg is a tale of a hardworking immigrants and 
        financial geniuses who got their start working alongside violent Chicago 
        gangsters while employed by newspaper titan William Randolph Hearst at 
        the turn of the last century. After some time, the owner of the Tribune, 
        Bertie McCormick, decided to hire Moses Annenberg away from Hearst. For 
        a while, the Annenberg brothers were sending out thugs to battle each 
        other. Fifteen years later, Max Annenberg was alleged to be an associate 
        and friend of Chicago crime boss Al Capone. In 1924, Moses Annenberg got 
        involved with a racing news service in Chicago and Milwaukee. Soon there 
        were reports that those who didn't take the Annenberg race wire service 
        were themselves the victims of beatings, fire bombings and, on occasion, 
        murder. The crime syndicates had come to be dependent on Moses 
        Annenberg. Without his service they couldn't operate their illegal 
        gambling rackets. In 1938, the Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, 
        traveled from Washington D.C. to give a speech in Philadelphia 
        condemning Moses Annenberg, who, at that time, was backing the 
        Republican candidate for governor of Pennsylvania. Ickes charged it was 
        Annenberg's violent tactics during the Chicago newspaper wars that 
        inspired gangsters like Al Capone. Ickes said that <em>&quot;the hiring of 
        Moses Annenberg by Hearst was the beginning of the subsequent flood of 
        lawlessness that almost engulfed law enforcement in the United States.&quot;
        </em>Moses, Walter, and 2 other business associates were indicted in 
        1939 for evading more than $2 million in taxes and another $3 million in 
        penalties and interest. Moses was later separately indicted for 
        conspiring to bribe a Philadelphia detective. In April 1940, Moses 
        Annenberg agreed to plead guilty to one count -- &quot;willfully&quot; evading 
        $1,217,296 -- and to pay almost $9 million in fines and penalties. In 
        exchange for his plea the government agreed to drop all charges against 
        his son, Walter Annenberg. In the 1940s, Walter Annenberg established 
        Triangle Broadcasting, which at its peak controlled 6 AM radio stations, 
        6 FM radio stations, and 6 TV stations. He is also the founder and owner 
        of Triangle Publications, which owned the Philadelphia Inquirer, the 
        Daily News, TV Guide and Seventeen Magazine. Received the Alfred I. 
        DuPont Award (Pilgrim) in 1951. Received the Marshall Field Award 
        (Pilgrim) in 1958. Founded The Annenberg School for Communication at The 
        University of Pennsylvania in 1958. Ambassador to England 1969-1974. 
        During his assignment to Britain, Annenberg appointed Gorden Gray as 
        chairman of his Triangle Broadcasting Company 1969�1975. Gray was very 
        big in government and intelligence since 1947, the original director of 
        the Psychological Strategy Board, and a heir to the R.J. Reynolds 
        fortune. Annenberg founded The Annenberg School for Communication at the 
        University of Southern California in 1971. In 1988, News Corp. acquired 
        Triangle Publications, including TV Guide. Founder-trustee and Chairman 
        of the Board of Trustees of the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho 
        Mirage, California. Annenberg also served as Trustee of the Eisenhower 
        Exchange Fellowships and the Winston Churchill Traveling Fellowships. He 
        was Emeritus Trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia 
        Museum of Art, The University of Pennsylvania and The Peddie School. 
        Annenberg received honorary degrees from many international 
        universities. Annenberg was named Honorary Knight Commander of the Order 
        of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. He was also named Officer 
        of the French Legion of Honor, and presented with the Order of Merit of 
        the Republic of Italy. (received dozens of other awards and honors) He

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Two days after the death of 
        dictator Francisco Franco on November 20, 1975 Juan Carlos was 
        designated King according to the law of succession promulgated by 
        Franco. He successfully oversaw the transition of Spain to a democratic 
        constitutional monarchy. Juan Carlos also claims the title of King of 
        Jerusalem, as the successor to the royal family of Naples. He is also a 
        direct descendant of Queen Victoria through his grandmother, and Louis 
        XIV of France through his family name, Bourbon. The Bourbons ruled 
        France until the French Revolution. He moved to Spain in 1948 to be 
        educated there after his father, Juan de Borb�n, persuaded Franco to 
        allow this. He began his studies in San Sebasti�n and finished them in 
        1954 at the San Isidro Institute in Madrid. He then joined the army, 
        doing his officer training, 1955-57, in Zaragoza. In 1956, his younger 
        brother, the Infante Alfonso died of a gunshot wound in Estoril, 
        Portugal, with Juan Carlos as the only witness. The official explanation 
        is that it was an accident which occurred while cleaning a gun. Alfonso 
        suffered from haemophilia, and did not survive. It is uncertain whether 
        Alfonso or Juan Carlos pulled the trigger. From 1957 he spent a year in 
        the naval school at Pontevedra and another in the Air Force school in 
        San Javier in Murcia. In 1961 he graduated from the Complutense 
        University. He then went to live in the Palace of Zarzuela, and began 
        carrying out official engagements. Carlos is a founder and honorary 
        president of WWF-Spain and a patron of the International Council for 
        Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC). Honorary member of the Club of 
        Rome. Carlos is known to be a very avid hunter. In 2004 he and his 
        entourage were accused of shooting at least 9 bears in Romania, at the 
        same time that the WWF was staging an international forum to showcase 
        their work in integrating bear and human populations. It was claimed by 
        the respected Aves Foundation that one of the bears was pregnant and 
        that the amount of bears (and other wildlife like wolves and boars) that 
        were shot, was completely unethical. Carlos goes hunting at times with 
        foreign leaders, including George Bush, Sr. Juan Carlos is a Knight of 
        Malta. Head of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Karl von Habsburg, son of

        (named as a financier of Permindex), Electronic Data Systems Corporation

        Financier, vice-president, and president (1983-1984) of the secretive 
        Council for National Policy, a major supporter of the Campus Crusade for 
        Christ, a main financier of the Wycliffe Bible Associates. The CNP

        Falwell, Oliver North, Edward Teller, John C. Whitehead and Stanley 
        Monteith of Liberty Radio (said he counters the propaganda). In 1951, 
        Bunker Hunt and Wallace Johnson, founder of Holiday Inns, worked with 
        and funded Bill Bright's Campus Crusade for Christdonating $15.5 
        million. In 1967, Hunt formed the Christian World Liberation Front 
        (CWLF) as a covert front for Campus Crusade, which split off and became 
        a leading ministry in the Jesus People movement. H.L. Hunt has been 
        named as a major financier of Permindex. Hunt is said to have partially 
        underwritten the cost of an anti-Kennedy newspaper advertisement that 
        appeared in the Dallas Morning News the day of the assassination. Hunt's 
        oil profits were said to be threatened by Kennedy's announced plans to 
        end the oil depletion allowance. A note written by Lee Harvey Oswald 
        addressed to &quot;Mr. Hunt&quot; has raised speculation as to whether it was 
        intended for the oil tycoon, one of his sons, or the CIA agent E. Howard 
        Hunt. Bunker Hunt arranged a retreat for more than 500 millionaires who 
        pledged $20 to Campus Crusade. He once organized a paramilitary force 
        called &quot;Americans Volunteer Group&quot; which he intended to use as a &quot;death 
        squad&quot; against political opponents. [Hougan 55-56; Saloma 53; Diamond 
        51-56, 250] In 1967, Nelson Bunker Hunt provided Cameron Townsend, 
        founder of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) and the Wycliffe 
        Bible Translators, property in Dallas for a new international 
        translation center. Thy Will Be Done, by Gerard Colby and Charlotte 
        Dennett, documents the business and political connections between 
        Wycliffe Bible Translators, the Rockefeller family, and the CIA. The 
        result of the dealings was the genocide of indigenous tribes in the 
        Amazon basin, although Cam Townsend denied the deaths. In 1966, H.L. 
        Hunt was approached for funding Vatican anti-communist operations in 
        Latin America. Bill Bright persuaded Nelson Bunker Hunt to underwrite 
        the $6 million cost to produce the 'Jesus' movie in the 1970s. Donated 
        $10 million to Pat Robertson's (CNP president, just like Hunt) Christian 
        Broadcasters Network in 1970. Hunt contributed to the contras through 
        NEPL, $484,500. He also illegally tried to corner the silver market in 
        the 1970, but this went wrong and the family ended up bankrupt. In 
        August of 1988 the Hunts were convicted of conspiring to manipulate the 
        market. Hunt is a member of The Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint

        &quot;His Highness&quot; by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957 at the death of his 
        grandfather, Aga Khan III. The Ismaili line of Imams supposedly trace 
        their lineage back to the Prophet Mohammed (born 570 AD) through Fatima 
        Zahra, Mohammed's daughter. Fatima Zahra's son, Husain, married a 
        daughter descended from the royal house of Persia from the most remote, 
        almost prehistoric, times. The Aga Khan's ancestors also ruled in Egypt 
        as Caliphs of the Fatimid dynasty for a number of years, at a period 
        coeval with the Crusades. His forefathers are said to have been involved 
        with the Assassins, the Kights Templar associates during the crusades 
        (12th and 13th century). Aga Khan I was a governor-general of the 
        Persian (Iran) province of Kerman. After an unsuccessful insurgence in 
        the 1840s against his sovereign, Khan had to flee to Afghanistan and 
        came under the protection of the British colonialists. He started to 
        provide mercenary services to the British in their conquest of 
        Afghanistan and ended up receiving a very decent pension. Aga Khan III 
        (1877-1957) was a founding member and president of the All India Muslim 
        League in 1906, which was the driving force behind the creation of 
        Pakistan as a Muslim state from British India (the minority Muslim group 
        had ruled India until the British put an end to that). In Pakistan, the 
        League formed the country's first government, but disintegrated in 1958 
        following an army coup. In 1932 Aga Khan III represented India at the 
        World Disarmament Congress and from 1937 to 1939 he was president of the 
        League of Nations. Aga Khan III was a Freemason and a member of the

        as an (earlier) chairman of the Forty Committee. As head of this 
        committee Kissinger had access to more information than the other 
        members and he is said to have distorted it at times. During this same 
        time period Kissinger also set up and headed the Washington Special 
        Action Group (WSAG), another very important foreign policy group.

        became known that the Atlanta branch had made $4 billion in unreported 
        loans to Iraq. After the revelation, the money was said to be used by 
        the Iraqis to buy food and agriculture equipment, but in reality they 
        were buying loads of military equipment. His consultancy firm, Kissinger 
        Associates, set up the China Ventures fund with CITIC in 1989, which 
        would be in the same year that he defended the Tiananmen Square

        and a director of AIG Global. In 1997, Kissinger became the central 
        advisor to the Business Coalition for US-China Trade, a group of about a 
        1000 leading companies willing to invest in China. In 2000, Henry 
        Kissinger was quoted by Business Wire: <em>&quot;Hank Greenberg, Pete 
        Peterson and I have been close friends and business associates for 
        decades.&quot;</em> Maurice Greenburg is head of AIG and Peter G. Peterson is 
        head of The Blackstone Group, which is the other major partner of 
        Kissinger Associates. Peterson is also a former chairman of Lehman 
        Brothers. Kissinger is a friend of Lynn Forester and introduced her to 
        Sir Evelyn de Rothschild at the 1998 Bilderberg conference. They would 
        soon become married. After Pulitzer Price winning journalist Peter 
        Arnett produced a CNN report on Operation Tailwind (a Vietnam operation 
        in which US Special Forces allegedly killed US defectors with Sarin) in 
        1998, Kissinger and his friends called up CNN to demand that the news 
        network should distance itself from the story (a story which CNN 
        initially approved) and made sure that the producers of the show were 
        publicly humiliated and fired. Arnett was fired again by NBC and 
        National Geographic in March 2003 immediately after he said the Bush 
        Administration was looking for a plan B now that Iraqi resistance turned 
        out to be much more intense than expected. Within 24 hours the Daily 
        Mail hired him. When Henry Kissinger is invited to speak at the United 
        Nations Association on April 11, 2001 Lord Jacob Rothschild is flanking 
        his side. Picked as the initial head of the 9/11 investigating committee 
        in 2003, although he turned out to be too controversial to remain in 
        that position. Henry Kissinger is a patron of the Open Russia Foundation 
        since 2001, together with Lord Jacob Rothschild. The Foundation was set 
        up by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a controversial oligarch, later locked up by 
        Putin. Honorary trustee of the Aspen Institute. Because of previous 
        international attempts by European and South American judges to question 
        him, he is known to take legal advice before traveling to certain 
        countries in either continent.</font></td>

        Bernhard was born and educated in Germany. Became a member of Sturm 
        (Hitler youth movement) around 1931, which is 2 years before Hitler came 
        to power. Became a member of the SS in 1934, which consisted of Hitler's 
        most elite and most trusted aides. This automatically ment he also 
        became a member of the NSDAP. At the Nuremberg trials the aristocratic 
        Nazi Friedrich Eberstein would claim how the Nazi party's prestige 
        sky-rocketed after aristocrats like Bernhard (specifically mentioned 
        him) joined the movement. Briefly worked with Gerhard Fritze, who owned 
        an Amsterdam bank financed by the Swedish Wallenberg family. Because of 
        his mother's connections, Bernhard went to work for NW-7, the IG Farben 
        industrial espionage unit, and ended up in it's Paris branch in 1935. IG 
        Farben was one of the main companies that built up the Nazi war machine. 
        It also made massive use of Auschwitz slave labor. While in Paris, and 
        staying with the aristocratic Kotzebue family, he became a close friend 
        of Sefton Delmer, who was a Daily Express journalist and an agent for 
        the Hitler- &amp; Hess intimate Lord Beaverbrook (his son was a member of 
        the 1001 Club), not to mention an employee of British intelligence. 
        Delmer had been in Berlin until 1933, having direct access to Hitler and 
        the Nazi party. Tom Driberg, a homosexual communist journalist who 
        worked for Beaverbrook too, also approached Bernhard in Paris. Driberg, 
        who already was a friend of Guy Burgess, worked for the Soviets, 
        codename LePage, and Bernhard considered him a friend too. Around this 
        time Bernhard had met with future Dutch queen Juliana, who was quite 
        desperate for a husband at that moment. Bernhard's IG Farben financial 
        advisor initially acted as a middle man between the two. It took 
        Bernhard quite a bit of effort to convince Wilhelmina that he was the 
        right person to marry her daughter, because he wasn't an exceptionally 
        high aristocrat and was considered a too extravagant. He was able to 
        marry Juliana in 1937. At this point he wasn't a member of the SS 
        anymore, but only after his marriage with Juliana, one day to be exact, 
        he resigned from the NSDAP. Unfortunately, he didn't put an autograph 
        under his letter, so officially he was a member of the NSDAP until 1938, 
        which is when his membership automatically expired. Earlier, on November 
        14, 1996 he met with Hitler to renounce his German citizenship. In his 
        personal diaries Hitler refers to Bernhard as a &quot;gigolo&quot;, but publicly 
        the marriage is considered a good thing. Around this time Bernhard met 
        with friends at IG Farben and the SS to say goodbye. Not long after the 
        Spanish civil war started in 1936 between the fascist Franco and the 
        democratically elected government, Bernhard and his brother had the 
        nerve to show up at a royal party in the Hague dressed as Franco 
        officers. In 1938, Bernhard's responsibilities increase and he has to 
        work closely with Francois van 't Sant, Queen Wilhelmina's right hand 
        and the most important liaison officer between MI6 and GSIII, the Dutch 
        military intelligence agency. Van 't Sant communicates anything that is 
        happening in Dutch high society to the British and makes a lot of money 
        in the process. Bernhard starts communicating information between Queen 
        Wilhelmina and GSIII, in which he makes many friends. At the same time 
        Bernhard starts to work as an informant for GSIII, communicating 
        messages from his German friends to the Dutch intelligence service. His 
        younger brother Aschwin, an officer of a German panzer division, 
        continually passes messages to him. They even travel together 
        occasionally. In the summer of 1938 they visit King George VI, under the 
        wary eyes of MI6. It is believed that they are discussing a German coup 
        in preparation by admiral and spychief Wilhelm Canaris (old friend of 
        the Lippe-Biesterfelds; boss of Aschwin; didn't seem to appreciate the 
        imperial aspirations of Hitler) and several of his associates. This coup 
        is called off in late 1939. As Bernhard is sure the Germans will attack 
        the Netherlands soon, not allowing it to be neutral, he quietly started 
        to receive his family's German possessions, moved to The Hague, and made 
        plans to evacuate his family to Paris. One month before the German 
        invasion of Holland, which occurred in May 1940, Bernard had a reunion 
        with his old buddy Gerhard Fritze and a group of IG Farben associates. 
        According to one of the attendants, Frank-Fahle, who was arrested after 
        war, Bernhard said to them, as inspector-general of the Dutch military, 
        that he would find it very difficult to lead Dutch troops in battle 
        against the Germans. When the German attack began the Oranges moved to 
        London. Bernhard went back for a few days, suggested to execute a few 
        Dutch collaborators of the Germans (which didn't happen), went to Paris, 
        and back again to London. For some reason, this short trip would make 
        him a legendary hero. In the UK Bernhard wasn't trusted and Ian Flemming, 
        the later James Bond author and a MI6/Naval Intelligence officer, was 
        sent to spy on him. Sefton Delmer (Naval Intelligence; the Beaverbrook 
        employee), Ian Flemming, and Prince Bernhard spent a lot of time 
        together, but it seems that Flemming couldn't find any pro-nazi 
        connections to Bernhard. Flemming later incorporated the character Count 
        Lippe, a low level member of a worldwide secret criminal group (SPECTRE) 
        involved in drug trade and extortion of NATO, in his James Bond movie 'Thunderball'. 
        Some have speculated this character might be a reference to Prince 
        Bernhard, who was born as Count von Lippe-Biesterfeld. Flemming would 
        slowly move out of Bernhard's life. Through Delmer, Bernhard came into 
        contact with Lord Beaverbrook (Aitken family; wanted peace with Hitler, 
        like Hitler himself wanted with the British Empire; close to Hitler and 
        Hess) and became very close with Penelope Aitken (married a nephew of 
        Lord Beaverbrook), who was the mother of Jonathan Aitken, a later MI6 
        agent and head of Le Cercle. During this time Bernhard (who recruited 
        the son of Lord Beaverbrook in the 1001 Club) also came into contact 
        with mystery man Joseph H. Retinger (raised by Polish nobility; MI6 and 
        likely a Jesuit or SMOM member; later founder of Bilderberg). Anthony 
        Drexel Biddle Jr., US Ambassador to the European governments in exile in 
        London during WWII, a Pilgrims Society member, and a person that 
        informed US intelligence about the Synarchist Movement of Empire in 
        France, became a good friend of Bernhard. Allen Dulles </font>

        and general Eisenhower became other close associates and friends of 
        Bernhard during WWII. FDR had always been a good friend of the Oranges. 
        In late 1940, Bernhard started to work as a liaison officer between the 
        newly established Dutch Central Intelligence Agency (CID) and the SIS 
        and SOE. Head of the CID became Francois van 't Sant, the most important 
        agent of the Oranges. Bernhards reputation got another dent when 
        Englandspiel came out in 1943, even though he didn't have a direct role 
        in the affair. During Englandspiel dozens of Dutch intelligence agents, 
        which were flown in from England, were immediately caught by waiting 
        Germans over a period of about a year. Captured agents sent plenty of 
        messages that the operation had been penetrated by the Germans, but the 
        SOE ignored them for some unknown reason. In 1944, after the Allied 
        invasion of Europe, Bernhard flew across the front and asked both the 
        Pope in Italy and Retinger in Poland to try and look out after his 
        family members that were still in Germany. It seemed however that 
        especially his mother could take care of herself with all the contacts 
        she had within IG Farben. In 1944, during the allied siege of the 
        Netherlands, Bernhard became head of the Domestic Forces (BS), which was 
        the coordination center for the Dutch resistance. His headquarters, 
        complete with wine cellar, was located in Hotel Metropole in Brussels 
        and consisted of members of MI6, the SOE, and Dutch resistance. One of 
        his closest friends here was Gerben Sonderman who used to work with SS 
        officer Klaus &quot;Butcher of Lyon&quot; Barbie. Barbie dreamed up Hitler's Final 
        Solution and was responsible for the rape, torture, and murder of 
        thousands of people. At Nuremberg Barbie was released by Pilgrims 
        Society member John J. McCloy and ended up in Bolivia where he became 
        responsible for setting up the local US-allied death squads and the 
        early drug exporting routes to the US via Columbia. After the failed 
        Battle of Arnhem in September 1944, which was part of the larger 
        Operation Market Garden, it turned out that Christiaan &quot;King Kong&quot; 
        Lindemans had given information about this operation to the Germans. 
        Lindemans, a hero of the resistance, worked in Bernhard's office and 
        supposedly was &quot;turned&quot; by the Germans in 1944. This became just another 
        dent in Bernhard's image, just as the fact that he was starting to 
        gather war loot around this time, like expensive BMWs and small 
        airplanes. After the liberation Bernhard's Gestapo&quot; started to become a 
        menace to the Dutch people, so his organization is not allowed to make 
        arrests anymore. Bernhard's II BD intelligence service now started to 
        map all fascist and anti-communist elements within Dutch society. One of 
        his closest associates has the surname Van Houten and is suspected by 
        British Intelligence to have been the same Van Houten on papers King 
        Kong, the spy who informed the Germans about the upcoming Battle of 
        Arnhem, had been carrying during the time of his arrest. Due to a lack 
        of proof the issue is dropped. When the Dutch government is restored 
        again, Bernhard is in favor of increased influence of the Royal House in 
        state affairs. It won't happen. Because of his ambitions Bernhard did 
        became the point man for the Anglo-American globalists from this moment 
        on. Bernhard started to work more with the United States. One of these 
        persons is Henry Luce agent C.D. Jackson </font><span class="style3">

        Division of SHAEF; one of the &quot;the Park Avenue Cowboys&quot;; vice president

        the President for Psychological Warfare; member Operations Coordinating 
        Board during his time as advisor; president of the National Committee 
        for a Free Europe; co-founder Radio Free Europe and the American 
        Committee for Cultural Freedom; thought the Zapruder film was too 
        shocking to release to the public)</font></span><font color="#FFFFFF">. 
        Jackson will largely be responsible for setting up the post WWII psywar 
        and US intelligence division in the Netherlands and other parts of 
        Western Europe. In 1945, the Dutch intelligence group BVD was set up and 
        Bernhard catapulted a lot of his friends in it. There is some infighting 
        however between Bernhard's friends and employees who don't want anything 
        to do with him. In 1946 King Kong is about to be investigated by the BVD 
        and Bernhard's friends fear he might release some compromising 
        information about the prince. Subsequently King Kong dies under 
        suspicious circumstances. BVD investigations into Englandspiel are also 
        done only very superficially. After the war, Bernhard made sure a lot of 
        his former nazi buddies were protected from prosecution and helped them 
        back into prominent positions. In 1948, it was discovered that Bernhard 
        was a member of the NSDAP. It is covered up and the press won't report 
        on it until 1976, after the Lockheed Affair. After WWII, Bernhard acted 
        as representative for the Dutch government and multinationals. Doing 
        business with the Fascist regime in Argentine, together with all the 
        fled nazis in that country, wasn't a problem for him. Also worked for 
        the CIA. Commander of the Dutch domestic army 1946-1976. 
        Inspector-General of the Dutch Air Force, Army, and Navy 1946-1976. The 
        Greet Hofmans-Affair from 1948 to 1956 created tensions between the 
        Prince and the Queen. The investigation results are still being 
        withheld, but it is known that Bernhard and the CIA were displeased with 
        Juliana's &quot;communist&quot; tendencies of disarmament of Europe to such an 
        extent that they were preparing to put her into a mental hospital (think 
        stay-behind networks?). Some believe Greet Hofmans actually was some 
        kind of Soviet spy. Bernhard held a speech at the University Club in New 
        York in 1953 where he called for European integration and a common 
        currency. Approached by his friend Joseph Retinger to establish 
        Bilderberg, which was founded in 1954 and sponsored by the CIA. 
        Bilderberg chairman 1954-1976. Bernhard got along very well Paul Henri 
        Spaak, Paul van Zeeland, JFK, Nixon, Ford, the Shah of Iran, and 
        countless other international individuals. He loved to duck hunt with 
        Stavros Niarchos (family of Onassis and also a 1001 Club member). His 
        wife, queen Juliana, invited UFO contactee George Adamski to their home 
        in 1959. First chairman of the WWF in 1961. President of the WWF until 
        his death. Co-founder of the 1001 Club in the early 1970s. Edmund de 
        Rothschild is the godfather of Alexia Grinda, one of his extramarital 
        daughters. Bernhard met the mother, the 18-year old Helene Grinda (of 
        the noble Roussel family), in 1966, at a swimming pool of the Rothschild 
        family. In 1974, Prince Bernhard sold his Castle Warmelo to the Evlyma 
        Trust in Liechtenstein, a subsidiary of Tibor Rosenbaum's (1001 Club; 
        Mossad agent; criminal) BCI. The Trust was managed by 1001 Club member 
        Herbert Batliner. Friends of Bernhard included David Rockefeller, H.J. 
        Heinz, Gianni Agnelli, Henry Ford II, Henry Luce, Tibor Rosenbaum, 
        Robert Vesco, Mobutu, Suharto, Cornelis Verolme, the Loudons of Shell, 
        Ernst van Eeghen, Ernst van den Beugel (KLM), and Freddie Heineken. 
        Accused of taking bribes from Lockheed and likely also Northrop in 1976. 
        Invested in KAS Enterprises, which became a front for the SAS in their 
        struggle against Mandela's ANC. In 1980 the Oranges had a capital of 650 
        million euros. A conservative estimate shows that this capital has grown 
        to at least 1,4 billion euros today. Most of this capital is invested in 
        real estate and shares in corporations like Shell. </font></font></td>

        captained the Orange Free State province. By the end of the 1960s Luyt 
        had become a millionaire. In 1989 he took over the Presidency of the 
        Transvaal Rugby union and shortly afterwards was elected President of 
        the South African Rugby football Union (SARFU). It was during this 
        period that he came under attack for his administration style and 
        efforts to transform the sport into a professional one. He was accused 
        of nepotism, bullying tactics, and administering autocratically. In 1992 
        Luyt clashed with the African National Congress when he chose to play 
        only the Afrikaans section of the national anthem at the Springbok�s 
        rugby test match against the All Blacks at Ellis Park stadium. Luyt 
        became infamous for his role in the court case involving President 
        Nelson Mandela. He was a hostile witness in the commission of inquiry 
        into SARFU affairs. Gradually people distanced themselves from him, 
        including his former son-in-law Rian Oberholzer, the then Managing 
        Director of SARFU. This moved resulted in Luyt�s sacking as President of 
        SARFU in May 1998. Luyt then ventured into politics with the Federal 
        Alliance Party (FA), which he financed personally. His stated purpose in 
        forming the FA was to protect the rights and integrity of Afrikaners. 
        The FA took part in South Africa�s first democratic election in 1999 but 
        won no seats, dissolving soon thereafter. As an entrepreneur, Luyt was

        <td vAlign="top" borderColor="#666666" align="left" width="0">
        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Born on June 9, 1916 in San 
        Francisco. McNamara graduated in 1937 from the University of California 
        at Berkeley and went on to earn a graduate degree from the Harvard 
        Business School, where from 1940 to 1943 he taught as an assistant 
        professor. Poor eyesight kept him out of combat during World War II, but 
        he served in the Air Force's Statistical Control Office, focusing, as he 
        had done at Harvard, on ways to improve efficiency and productivity. 
        After the war he brought his management skills to the ailing Ford Motor 
        Company and became one of the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; credited with the company's 
        revival. In 1960 he became the first person outside the Ford family to 
        rise to the position of president of the company. The same year, 
        McNamara accepted President-elect John Kennedy's offer to become 
        secretary of defense. McNamara set out to reorganize and streamline the 
        nation's defense force and its bureaucracy. He was central to the 
        Kennedy administration's drive to change U.S. military strategy from its 
        Eisenhower-era reliance on nuclear &quot;massive retaliation&quot; to one of 
        &quot;flexible response,&quot; including a range of conventional options. McNamara 
        emphasized cost control, the phasing out of what he believed to be 
        obsolete weapons systems, and greater overall efficiency. While arguing 
        that there was no essential difference between large organizations such 
        as Ford and the Pentagon, and even though he did gain considerable 
        control over the defense establishment, McNamara also had to deal with 
        resistance from a variety of powerful, entrenched traditionalists in the 
        various services, to say nothing of Capitol Hill. Trusted by Kennedy, 
        McNamara became very influential in the administration. He was an 
        important member of Kennedy's circle of advisers during the 1962 Cuban 
        Missile Crisis. He was also a central figure in the evolution of the 
        nation's nuclear strategy from &quot;massive retaliation&quot; to a more limited 
        &quot;counterforce&quot; doctrine to &quot;mutually assured destruction,&quot; seeking 
        international strategic stability. During the Vietnam War, McNamara 
        initially was a great believer in victory and was convinced the United 
        States could win thanks to its technological superiority. But by 1966 
        McNamara became disillusioned with the war and offered his resignation 
        to President Johnson in 1967. In 1968, he became president of the World 
        Bank. During the 1980s he became a critic of the nuclear arms race and a 
        proponent of a policy of &quot;no first use.&quot; McNamara recently published a 
        memoir on Vietnam, admitting that he had been tragically misguided in 
        his view and conduct of the war. Due to the McCarthy hysteria all the 
        nuanced, clear thinkers at the State Department had been purged. 
        McNamara has been a member of Bilderberg, the Atlantic Council of the 
        United States, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral 
        Commission. He was a primary sponsor of the United Nations affiliated 
        (New Age) Lucis Trust together with Greenpeace (1001 Club), the 
        Rockefeller Foundation (undoutedly represented at the 1001 Club; 
        Pilgrims) and Thomas Watson of IBM (1001 Club; Pilgrims). It used to be 
        called the 'Lucifer's Trust' and was inspired by Alice Bailey (who, in

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">McTaggart was born in Vancouver, 
        British Columbia, in 1932 (died in 2001). David McTaggart was among the 
        chief contributors to the creation of the environmentalist group 
        Greenpeace in 1971 and became it's chief spokesman. From 1972 and on he 
        did everything he could to stop the French from conducting nuclear 
        tests. McTaggart was chairman of Greenpeace International from 1979 
        until 1991. The Canadian businessman had become involved with the issue 
        of French atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in New Zealand in 1971, 
        and his life was tied to environmental issues from then on. Between 1975 
        and 1991, McTaggart was a driving force behind Greenpeace campaigns to 
        save the whales, stop the dumping of nuclear waste in the ocean, block 
        the production of toxic wastes, end nuclear testing, and protect the 
        Antarctic continent from oil and mineral exploitation. Over the length 
        of his career he published numerous articles and two books. Awards for 
        his contributions to environmentalism world-wide include the Onassis 
        Award, The Kreisky Prize, and the United Nations Environmental 
        Programme's Global 500 Award. In September of 1991, McTaggart retired 
        from active chairmanship of Greenpeace International to a farm in Italy, 
        where he raised organic olive oil and continued to work on whaling and 
        other issues through his own foundation. Mr. McTaggart died in an auto 
        accident on March 23, 2001 near his home in Italy.</font></td>

        in law, he worked for his uncle who was a shipowner. At the age of 25, 
        Stavros Niarchos became independent and frequented the prestigious royal 
        yacht club. He was a naval officer in the Second World War, during which 
        time part of the trade fleet he had built with his uncle was destroyed. 
        Nearly 2 million dollars in insurance money helped him to buy another 
        fleet. In 1952, the same year as his rival Aristotle Onassis, Stavros 
        Niarchos built the first supertankers capable of transporting enormous 
        quantities of oil and fuel. In 1956, the Suez Canal Crisis considerably 
        increased the demand for the type of large tonnage ships that Niarchos 
        owned. Business flourished and he became a billionaire, just like his 
        rival, Aristotle Onassis. The shipowners' rivalry continued into their 
        private lives. After his divorce from Henry Ford's daughter, Stavros 
        Niarchos married Georges Livanos' sister, Eugenia. When she passed away, 
        he married her sister Tina Onassis, who was also Aristotle's ex wife. At 
        the head of a 4 billion dollar fortune, the rich shipowner prided 
        himself on having married five times in the course of his life. After 
        the oil crisis of 1973, Stavros Niarchos sold off some of his companies 
        and launched into finances and the diamond trade. In the eighties, he 
        came more and more often to Geneva, from where he managed his business 
        around the globe. The Golden Greek, as his fellow countrymen liked to 
        call him, retired in the nineties to his main residence in Saint-Moritz, 
        in the Graubunden, where he devoted a lot of time to his favorite sport, 
        skiing. One of the largest investors in Rockefeller Center until 2001,

        USSR-British invasion (officially Iran was neutral). The British were of 
        the opinion that the son would be more open to western free market 
        influences, which turned out to be right. In 1953, the Shah supported 
        Operation Ajax, the coup that overthrew prime minister Mohammed 
        Mossadegh. The Brits didn't appreciate Mossadegh's succesful effort to 
        nationalize the Iranian oil industry. Allen Dulles (Pilgrims; SMOM;

        agent in 1951. Worked at the Swiss Israeli Bank through which he funded 
        Mossad operations. Head of the Jewish Agency, an organization which 
        supported Jews who were interested in migrating to Israel. Ran the 
        Israel Corporation with Edmond de Rothschild (once chairman), a 
        fundraising institution which gathered funds for land purchases in 
        Palestine. The Mossad and the Israeli Labour Party (headed by David 
        Ben-Gurion, a close friend of the Rothschilds) sent funds to Rosenbaum 
        so they were able to invest anonymously in Europe and the United States. 
        Rosenbaum secretly speculated with a large part of these funds. In 1958 
        he set up the Swiss Banque du Credit International (BCI) with the help 
        of Edmond de Rothschild. Rosenbaum and his BCI directors laundered 
        illegal drug and gambling money from mafia boss Meyer Lansky by 
        investing it in real estate. Through the BCI Mossad and Permindex 
        operations were financed. In the early 1960s, the BCI bought a 
        significant stake in Henry Luce's Time Life. Permindex has been the main 
        suspect of having coordinated the 1963 JFK murder. Edmond de Rothschild 
        introduced Rosenbaum to Bernhard in the mid-1960s. In 1970 Bernhard 
        invited Rosenbaum into the 1001 Club, but after Rosenbaum got in trouble 
        for having embezzled money of the BCI, Bernhard had to expel him again. 
        This happened in 1973-1974. In 1974, Prince Bernhard sold his Castle 
        Warmelo to the Evlyma Trust in Liechtenstein, a subsidiary of Tibor 
        Rosenbaum's BCI. The Trust was managed by 1001 Club member Herbert 
        Batliner, a person later linked to laudering funds for Marcos, Mobutu, 
        Escobar, and Helmut Kohl. The BCI was closed down and for a short time 
        Tibor went to jail. The rest of his life he tried to pay his debts. In 
        1980 he died of a heart attack.</font></td>

        customers and 83 branches - the third largest network in the city after 
        Citibank and Chase Manhattan. It also had private banking operations in 
        New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Asia. In 1990, this Republic Bank was 
        identified as a favorite laundromat for both the Medell�n Cartel and 
        Lebanese-based heroin and hashish smugglers. The bank has also been 
        accused of transferring billions of U.S. Federal Reserve notes from New 
        York to organized crime-controlled Moscow banks, on behalf of Russian 
        organized crime figures. Safra is also under investigation by U.S. and 
        Swiss authorities for laundering Turkish and Columbian drug money. In 
        2000, the Republic New York Corporation and its sister company Safra 
        Republic Holdings were acquired by HSBC for $10.3 billion. Edmond Safra 
        is a longtime friend and business associate of Swiss banker Edgar de 
        Picciotto, who comes from an old Portuguese Jewish trading family, sits 
        on the board of Soros' Quatum Fund, is a director of American Express 
        Bank SA of Geneva, was chairman of the Geneva private bank CBI-TDB Union 
        Bancaire Privee (major player in the gold and offshore hedge funds), and 
        has also been involved in numerous scandals. De Picciotto is also a 
        longtime business partner of Venetian businessman Carlo De Benedetti, 
        closely linked with the P2 lodge scandal. Edmond Safra died in a fire in 
        his Monte-Carlo apartment back in 1999. One of his male nurses (a former 
        U.S. Marine) supposedly set fire to the building in order to rescue him 
        and be the hero. Among the friends of the Safra couple were Nancy 
        Reagan, Condoleezza Rice, and Prince Charles.</font></td>

        since 1963, founder of Wildfowl Trust in Slimbridge, Gloucetershire in 
        1964. Sir Peter Markham Scott (September 14, 1909 - August 29, 1989), 
        ornithologist, conservationist and painter, was born in London, the only 
        child of Antarctic explorer Sir Robert Falcon Scott. He is a 
        half-brother of Wayland Young (Lord Kennet). He was educated at Oundle 
        School and Cambridge University, graduating from Trinity College in 
        1931. He inherited his artistic talent from his mother, Kathleen, and 
        had his first exhibition in London in 1933. In 1936, he represented the 
        United Kingdom at sailing in the Olympic Games. During World War II, 
        Scott served in the navy, emulating his father. He was in the &quot;little 
        ships&quot; against German E-boats. He stood as a Conservative candidate 
        unsuccessfully in the 1945 general election in Wembley, North. In 1948, 
        he founded the organisation with which he was ever afterwards closely 
        associated, the Severn Wildfowl Trust (now the Wildfowl and Wetlands 
        Trust) with its headquarters at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire. In the 
        years that followed, he led several ornithological expeditions 
        worldwide, and became a television personality, popularizing the study 
        of wildfowl and wetlands. He wrote and illustrated several books on the 
        subject, including his autobiography, The Eye of the Wind (1961). Scott 
        was also an accomplished sailor winning an Olympic Bronze medal for 
        single-handed dinghy sailing and numerous other sailing championships. 
        He also skippered the 12 metre yacht Sovereign in 1964 challenge for the 
        America's Cup which was held by USA. Sovereign suffered a whitewash 4-0 
        defeat in a very one-sided competition where the American boat was seen 
        to be the faster design. From 1973-1983 Sir Peter Scott was Chancellor 
        of the University of Birmingham. He also founded the World Wildlife Fund 
        and designed its panda logo. He is also remembered for giving the 
        scientific name of Nessiteras rhombopteryx to the Loch Ness Monster so 
        that it could be registered as an endangered species. The name, based on 
        Greek, means &quot;the wonder of Ness with the diamond shaped fin&quot; but is 
        also an anagram of &quot;Monster hoax by Sir Peter S&quot;.</font></td>

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Born in Lisala, Belgian Congo (now 
        The Democratic Republic of Congo.) After an education under the tutelage 
        of Belgian friars Mobuto chose a military career and eventually rose to 
        become commander in the Belgian army at the age of 30 with the rank of 
        colonel. In 1958 he joined Patrice Lumumba's Congolese National Movement 
        Party, and thus found himself close to the the centre of power when 
        Lumumba was made Prime Minister, following independence two years later. 
        He took advantage of this during the ensuing power struggle with the 
        province of Katanga, stepping into the Prime Minister's shoes following 
        temporarily when Lumumba was killed. The rule was short, however as 
        Mobuto handed power back to the civilian government within six months. 
        He was not so generous a few years later. He put a stop to the civil war 
        that gripped the country between 1963 and 1965 and once again took 
        control of the state machinery, this time for good. The Congo has the 
        potential to be perhaps Africa's richest nation and it achieved 
        impressive levels (6-7% every year) of growth following independence and 
        during the first few years of Mobuto's rule. This changed however after 
        1973. Between 1971 and 1973 Mobuto embarked on a program of 
        Zairereanisation. The country's name was changed to Zaire; in came a new 
        national anthem and flag; he demanded his countrymen and women call each 
        other citoyen &amp; citoyenne; abandon European names and wear a jacket of 
        his own design called the abacost. But perhaps most significant was the 
        economic impact of Zaireanisation. In a move out of character for 
        someone supposedly a bulwark against communism, Mobuto nationalized not 
        only the entire foreign owned industrial sector of the economy but also 
        grabbed small businesses from the hands of Greek, Portuguese and 
        Pakistani expats and handed them to 'sons of the country.' Mobuto 
        remained in power until 1997, when he was forced to leave by an invading 
        army from Rwanda under the command of future president Laurent Kabila. 
        Herbert Batliner from Lichtenstein is said to have been laundering money 
        for Mobutu at the time he presided over Zaire. Besides being a senior 
        lawyer and fund manager who managed over 10,000 letterbox companies, 
        Batliner is today's (2005) president of Pontificia Accademia delle 
        Scienze Sociali located in Vatican City. </font></td>

        Strong. Ran away from home in 1943, but his father retrieved him. Ran 
        away again and became Arctic trading-post employee for the Hudson's Bay 
        Company 1944-1945. Went to New York in 1947 to take a job as assistant 
        pass officer in the Identification Unit of the Security Section. He 
        lived with Noah Monod, then treasurer of the United Nations. In 1947, at 
        the age of only 18, he is listed as a member of the Secretariat of the 
        United Nations in New York. Here, he (supposedly) first met David 
        Rockefeller and learned that the UN's funds were handled by 
        Rockefeller's Chase Bank. He also met the other Rockefeller brothers and 
        other influential people as well. Although Strong kept his UN job only 
        two months, he met very influential people through Noah Monod. According 
        to the National Council for Science and the Environment: <em>&quot;He 
        [Maurice] first worked with the United Nations as a junior officer in 
        1947, when he was just eighteen, and returned in 1970 to lead the 
        Conference on the Human Environment in Geneva, after which he became the 
        executive director of the UN's environmental program...&quot;</em> Strong 
        returned to Winnipeg, failed to qualify for the Royal Canadian Air 
        Force, and took a job as trainee analyst for James Richardson &amp; Sons in 
        1948. By 1951, he had taken a job with Dome Petroleum, on whose board of 
        directors was Henrie Brunie, a close friend of John J. McCloy (and a 
        later friend of Strong). Dome became one of the largest oil companies in 
        Canada but its shareholders resided on Wall Street. In 1951 Strong 
        married, and in 1952, abruptly sold his home, quit his job and took a 
        world cruise. He wound up in Nairobi and took a job with CalTex 
        1953-1954, a company formed to exploit Saudi oil. His job involved 
        travel to exotic parts of the world for two years. Strong visited his 
        distant cousin, Robbins Strong, in Geneva, who was the Secretary of the 
        Extension and Intermovement Aid Division of the international YMCA. He 
        met Leonard Hentsch whose Swiss bank handled the money of the YMCA. 
        Strong wanted to become an international ambassador for the YMCA, but 
        settled for a position on the International Committee of the U.S.A. and 
        Canada which raised funds for the YMCA. From 1958 to 1961, he formed M. 
        F. Strong Management Ltd., Calgary and assumed the management of Ajax 
        Petroleums Ltd., which he reorganized to form Canadian Industrial Gas 
        and Oil Ltd. At that time, it was one of the largest Canadian 
        independent energy companies (now Norcen). He elevated his role in the 
        international YMCA and Canada's Liberal Party. Executive vice-president 
        of Power Corporation 1961-1963. Chairman committee extension and inter 
        movement aid World Alliance YMCA's 1963-1965. President of the Power

        Prime-Minister, into the company as his assistant. Founder and first 
        President of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) 
        1966-1970. Through his creation and direction of CIDA, Strong controlled 
        the implementation of aid programs on the ground -- including who was 
        hired to do the work, and through the newly created IDRC (by his mentor 
        Lester Pearson), Strong controlled the issuance of tax deductible

        environment program of the United Nations, New York 1971-1975. From 
        1971, he served as a trustee for the Rockefeller Foundation and the 
        Aspen Institute. Later also served as an advisor to the Rockefeller 
        Foundation and a member of the Club of Rome. Secretary-general of the

        1976-1978. Chairman and largest shareholder of AZL Resources 1978-1983. 
        In 1981, as head of AZL, he was sued for allegedly hyping the stock 
        ahead of a merger that eventually failed. He settled for $4.2 million at 
        the insistence of his insurance company. February 7, 1997, The Standing 
        Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, the words of Senator Jack Austin, 
        President of Canada-China Business Council: <em>&quot;The Canada-China 
        Business Council was organized in 1978, at the very beginning of the 
        Deng Xiaoping economic reform period. It was organized by a group of 
        leaders, Paul Desmarais [Sr.], Maurice Strong, Paul Lin, and one or two 
        others, to begin the development of a commercial relationship with 
        China.&quot; </em>May 15, 2005, Pittsburgh Live: <em>&quot;A near-compulsive 
        talker, one item about which Strong is almost taciturn is his relations 
        with China's elite. Strong does not mention his late cousin Anna Louise 
        Strong. The Marxist journalist was a member of the Comintern and spent 
        two years with Chairman Mao. Her funeral in 1970 was organized 
        personally by Chou En-lai, China's prime minister. Some claim that 
        Strong arranged the Nixon-Kissinger initial meetings with the Chinese. 
        However, Strong makes full use of Cousin Anna's memories among Beijing's 
        elite and has had excellent relationships with the Chinese for 30 
        years.&quot; </em>Maurice bought the Colorado Land &amp; Cattle Company and its 
        accompanying 200,000 acres of San Luis Valley in Colorado in 1978 (now 
        owned by the Conservation Fund). This land sits on multiple huge 
        underground water streams. Strong &amp; Co. created American Water 
        Development Inc. in 1986 to pump up this water. After the locals started 
        protesting, saying the valley would be turned into a desert, Strong 
        decided to save his reputation as environmentalist and bailed out. The 
        ranch belonged to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, a man who's career 
        was started by the Bin Ladens and who strong connections to British 
        intelligence. Supposedly, in 1978, a mystic informed Hanne and Maurice 
        Strong that <em>&quot;the Baca would become the center for a new planetary 
        order which would evolve from the economic collapse and environmental 
        catastrophes that would sweep the globe in the years to come.&quot;</em> 
        Hanne and Maurice Strong created the Manitou Foundation in 1988, a New 
        Age institute on or near the Baca Ranch. On the website it reads: <em>
        &quot;In the mid 1990�s, Manitou and specialists of The Conservation Fund, 
        with generous support of Laurance Rockefeller [the late UFO/Crop Circle 
        investigations funder] and the Jackson Hole Preserve, devoted several 
        years to extensive studies of Manitou�s mountain properties, culminating 
        in the creation of the Manitou Habitat Conservation Plan (MHCP).&quot;</em> 
        At the ranch there are representatives of many of the world's religions, 
        spiritual movements, and New Age sects, including the Catholic and 
        Protestant churches, Buddhist monks, and representatives of different 
        variations on Hinduism. A circular temple has been built on the ranch 
        where the missionaries of different religions can contemplate with each 
        other. If you look at the floor plan you'll see the building is a 
        complex flower (the representatives sit in circles within this flower) 
        within a Celtic Cross/Hindu Kiakra. The latter two represent a divine 
        sexual union. The building seems to be a Rosy Cross, which can be 
        interpreted as having the same meaning. In that last case, the color of 
        the rose would correspond with the nearby mountain range: Sangre de 
        Cristo, meaning 'Blood of Christ', the sacred name the Spanish settlers 
        decided to reserve for it. Nicholas de Vere, former head of the British 
        Dragon Court, wrote: <em>&quot;The Rose represents... the magical menstrual 
        flow of Solomon's beloved.&quot;</em> George Hunt, who visited the place, 
        asked to a Catholic priest there, father Victor, what the purpose of the 
        temple is: <em>&quot;We contemplate on the sexual union of the church with 
        God... that's our mission, because we're fulfilling a role that the pope 
        wants us to fulfill. I don't know, we're just contemplating on the 
        sexual union of the church with God.&quot;</em> The San Luis Valley is an 
        amazing place. Twelve different Indian tribes used the Valley as a 
        sacred hunting and vision-quest area. Some of these tribes have legends 
        about the 'Sipapu', or 'place of reemergence', near the lakes area. They 
        believe that their ancestors were led underground to safety at this 
        location by the 'Ant People', just before a cleansing period of the 
        earth started. According to the Navajo tradition, they were warned of 
        the upcoming cataclysms by 'sky katchinas' (sky spirits). They also 
        claimed that the 'star people' enter our reality at the sacred Blanca 
        Massif in the Valley. The San Luis Valley happens to be a place with 
        enormous UFO activity (even before the modern UFO era started in June 
        1947). During peak UFO waves in the late 1960s dozens of cars would 
        literally line the roads watching the amazing aerial displays of unknown 
        lights as they cavorted around in the sky above the Great Sand Dunes/Dry 
        Lakes area. In 1967 the first case of a typical cattle mutilation was 
        reported in this valley (Sept. 9, a horse called Snippy. Reported by the 
        AP and Washington Post in early October). The phenomenon would become 
        epidemic in the early to mid 1970s. Maurice Strong introduced Edmund de 
        Rothschild on the Fourth World Wilderness Conference in September 1987, 
        held in Denver and southern Colorado: <em>&quot;One of the most important 
        initiatives that is open here for your consideration is that of the 
        Conservation Banking Program. As mentioned this morning, we have 
        [inaudible] here the person who really is the source of this very 
        significant concept. He was/is one of the trustees of the International 
        Wilderness Foundation which sponsored this meeting. He was at the first 
        of these conferences. His conversion to the relationship between 
        conservation and economic development has been a pioneering one... Many 
        of the energy developments that we have seen have come from his early 
        anticipation of our energy needs... And I'm just delighted to have this 
        opportunity of introducing to you, Edmund de Rothschild.&quot;</em> Edmund 
        (Pilgrims Society) thanks &quot;Maurice&quot; and gives a speech about Global 
        Warming and what to do about the melting polar caps, the stuff we are 
        all familiar with today. David Rockefeller (Pilgrims Society), James 
        Baker (Pilgrims Society), and Michael Sweatman (Royal Bank of Canada; 
        president World Conservation Bank; close associate of Edmund de 
        Rothschild) also gave speeches. The charge for attending the multi-day 
        conference was $650 and was visited by about 1500 businessmen. George 
        Hunt, who attended the conference, was warned (indirectly) by David 
        Rockefeller not to distribute any rebukes of what was said or &quot;he would 
        regret it&quot;. Maurice was chairman of the International Energy Development 
        Corporation 1980-1983. Chairman of the Canada Development Investment 
        Corporation and the Canadian government holding company for state 
        enterprises 1981-1984. Member of the World Commission on Environment and

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Thurn comes from the Torriani or 
        Della Torre family what was one the ruling families in northern-Italy in 
        the 13th-15th century. They were struggling for power with the Guelphs, 
        the Ghibellines, the Visconti, etc. Very few princely families have been 
        able to play such an important role in Europe without ever appearing as 
        actors in the main stage of history. The dynasty of the Princes of Thurn 
        und Taxis is such a family. The family's fortunes prospered along those 
        of the imperial court at Vienna (Habsburg dynasty). For more than 300 
        years (15th-18th century), the Thurn und Taxis held the monopoly over 
        imperial communications and post between Vienna and the far flung 
        Habsburg possessions that formed the Holy Roman Empire of the German 
        Nation. It was Napoleon Bonaparte who first attacked the Thurn und Taxis 
        monopoly (from about 1795). The loss of the mail monopoly did little to 
        affect the power of the Thurn und Taxis for by then, the family had 
        diversified into a myriad other enterprises from foodstuffs to banking 
        to railroads. Their wealth was vast and very few other European families 
        could match it. In the 19th century the intermarried with different 
        European royal families, including Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In later times, 
        Prince Albert of Thurn und Taxis was deeply opposed to the advent of 
        Adolph Hitler. The family lost two members in the war, together with a 
        large part of their fortunes. A lot of it was located behind the iron 
        curtain. Johannes started to rebuild the empire in 1952 and by 1990, 
        when he died, he had done this for the most part. Unfortunately, he died 
        unexpectedly, which brought a lot of chaos to the family's fortune. 
        Gloria, his wife (38 years younger) with whom he partied during the 
        1980s, had been selling a lot of the holdings in the 1990s. Today she 
        raises her sons and they hope to rebuild their vast fortune once again. 
        The Palace of Thurn and Taxis in Bavaria is still in use today and it 
        contains more rooms than Buckingham Palace. Gloria is involved with 
        ecological business. The assets of the family are managed through the 
        Thurn und Taxis Group. </font>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">In 1990, Joseph Brewda wrote 
        something very interesting for EIR: <em>&quot;On Oct. 15, 1982, a month after 
        the 1982 massacres, Sharon held meetings�in the Chouf Mountains of 
        Lebanon and at his Negev ranch�with Falange leader Camille Chamoun, Uri 
        Dan, Rupert Murdoch, Charles Douglas-Home, and others, to move the 
        &quot;Landscam&quot; West Bank real estate grab forward. On Nov. 15, 1982, a final 
        meeting took place on several real estate purchases, mostly through Arab 
        middle-men, to push the massive expansion of Jewish settlements 
        throughout the West Bank�at a handsome profit. Attending the meeting at 
        Sharon's ranch were: Kissinger, Lord Harlech (Sir David Ormsby-Gore), 
        Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, Tory Parliamentarian Julian Amery, 
        Sir Edmund Peck, and MI6 Mideast mandarin Nicholas Elliot.&quot;</em> I could 
        be wrong, but I never heard EIR, Joseph Brewda, or pretty much anyone 
        else talk in any detail about Le Cercle. In the meantime I found out 
        that Julian Amery was the chairman of this secret intelligence group and 
        Nicholas Elliot was another important member. Amery's father was a 
        hugely important Zionist. Look at the article about Le Cercle for all 
        the details. Of course it's no surprize that Kissinger is said to have 
        been a member too. By the way, last year the prince's favorite fashion 
        designer, Rudolph Moshammer, was found dead in a suburb of Munich with a 
        phone cord tied around his neck. This person was also a favorite fashion 
        designer of Arnold Schwarzenegger and King Carl Gustaf of Sweden. Maybe 
        it's nothing, but I come across a lot of strange deaths investigating 
        this circuit. Member of the 1001 Club. </font></td>

        computers. The new machines were compatible within the range�i.e., they 
        could run the same software and use the same peripherals�but 
        incompatible with the former mainframes. The new series, called the

        <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">(Windsor) Mountbatten, Prince 
        Philip</font></td>
        <td width="0"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Born in 1921 on the 
        Isle of Corfu, Greece. Parents were evacuated from Greece after a 
        revolution and both became depressed (father) or mentally instable 
        (mother). Studied in Germany under Kurt Hahn and both came to Scotland 
        in 1933. Played polo in his youth, often against Sir Evelyn de 
        Rothschild. Philip is the Duke of Edinburgh, a Knight of the Order of 
        the Garter, a Knight of the Order of the Thistle, Grand Master and First 
        or Principal Knight of the Order of the British Empire, and was a prince 
        of Greece and Denmark until he married. Patron or President of 814 
        organizations. His wife, Queen Elizabeth II is patron of the Pilgrims 
        Society. Long career in the navy from the start of WWII as a midshipsman 
        to commanding his own frigate, the HMS Magpie. William R. Denslow's 
        10,000 Famous Freemasons: <em>&quot;Philip was initiated in Navy Lodge No. 
        2612 of London on Dec 5, 1952. Present at the initiation were the Earl 
        of Scarbrough, grand master, q.v., and Geoffrey Fisher, archbishop of 
        Canterbury.&quot;</em> Philip is a Master Mason, never having shown great 
        interest in the organization, while his cousin, Prince Edward (b. 1935) 
        is the grand master of the United Grand Lodge. He and his wife set off 
        for a tour of the Commonwealth, with visits to Africa, Australia, and 
        New Zealand in 1952. They went on to visit the remote parts of the 
        Commonwealth in 1956. Gordon Creighton, a Foreign Service official and 
        Intelligence officer, concluded his story about a reported 1960s UFO 
        landing on the estate of Prince Philip with: <em>&quot;So there had been a 
        landing on the estate of Mountbatten and there was Mountbatten's great 
        interest.&quot;</em> The entire testimony was made during an interview with 
        the Disclosure Project in September 2000. Prince Philip supposedly had a 
        drawer full of sketches and information on different types of UFOs. 
        Philip co-founded the WWF International in 1961 with Julian Huxley and 
        Prince Bernhard. He has been the long time president of WWF UK. 
        Co-founded the 1001 Nature Trust and 1001 Club from 1971 to 1974, 
        together with Anton Rupert and Prince Bernhard. Co-founded the 
        Interfaith consultations between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in 1984, 
        together with Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan and Sir Evelyn de Rothschild 
        at Windsor castle. In August 1988, Prince Philip said to the West German 
        Deutsche Press Agentur: <em>&quot;In the event that I am reincarnated, I 
        would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something 
        to solve overpopulation&quot;.</em> He wrote something along similar lines in 
        the foreword of the 1987 book 'If I Were An Animal', written by Fleur 
        Cowles. Philip was supposedly hostile to Diana after she divorced 
        Charles in 1996. Mohamed Al-Fayed claimed Prince Philip had ordered 
        Diana's murder who was killed in a car crash on August 31, 1997. Queen 
        Elizabeth II said to Diana's butler Paul Burrell in December 1997: <em>
        &quot;Nobody, Paul has been as close to a member of my family as you have... 
        There are powers at work in this country about which we have no 
        knowledge.&quot;</em> She advised him to be cautious and to lay low. Unlike 
        his son, Charles, Philip supports genetically modified foods. On June 7, 
        2000, The Guardian quoted the Duke of Edinburgh as saying: <em>&quot;Do not 
        let us forget we have been genetically modifying animals and plants ever 
        since people started selective breeding.&quot;</em> Philip is known to be the 
        head of the family; what he says, generally goes. He is still president 
        emeritus of the WWF International.</font></td>
