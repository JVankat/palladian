<P>
The secret to reading is no secret. For most of us, it just takes common
sense and a little work. However, if your child has difficulty with vision,
hearing or speech, you need to address these physical problems first. Glasses
may be needed to bring letters into focus or exercises required for tracking.
Proper hearing is essential to understanding the link between letters and
sounds. And difficulty with speech often translates into reading roadblocks.
Talk to a professional if you are in doubt about vision, hearing or speech
deficits. After all, you wouldn't ask someone to learn to swim with a broken
arm. For more information on these and other disabilities, see the section
on our home page covering learning disability. It provides a general overview
of learning problems and discusses diet, food allergy, preservatives, vitamins,
supplements, prescription drugs and classroom strategies.

<IMG SRC="B/BOY.GIF" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="185" ALIGN="Right" ALT="Boy Graphic for Free Phonics Worksheets and Reading Tests with support for Alphabetics, Phonemic Awareness, Word Structure, Vocabulary, Comprehension and Learning Disabilities">Next,
you need to cover the basics. You can do this by returning to the Home Page
and clicking the Basics menu item. Reading is based on the gut knowledge
words are built from sounds and that sounds may be represented by letters.
Professionals give these concepts the fancy names Phonemic Awareness and
Alphabetics. Reading progress is greatly accelerated when a child is comfortable
with sounds and associates them with letters. Spend some time with the Basics.
It will be time well spent. And don't forget the obvious, read to your child
every day. Pick stories your child enjoys and point out words as you go along.
The public library is a great resource and the library is free.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
After your student has mastered the basics, it's time to jump into
phonics.&nbsp;Phonics is the set of skills that decode a group of letters
into the sounds of a word. At Learning Target, we have organized phonics
into simple skills, created tests to measure these skills and developed hundreds
of lessons to teach phonics skills. This allows you to target those skills
that are weak, maximizing your gain and minimizing your effort. You only
study the lessons that are needed. Here are some steps to help begin your
phonics program.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<B>Step One: </B>&nbsp;Estimate reading grade level. For instance, if your
child is nearing the end of second grade and the teacher reports the beginning
of a reading problem, you might guess a reading level of early second grade.
Use your best judgement or ask your teacher for an estimate.

<IMG SRC="G/GIRLCUTE.GIF" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="163" ALIGN="Left" ALT="Girl Graphic for Free Phonics Worksheets and Reading Tests with support for Alphabetics, Phonemic Awareness, Word Structure, Vocabulary, Comprehension and Learning Disabilities"><B>Step
Two: </B>&nbsp;From the Phonics pages, print placement tests for your estimated
grade level. Take it easy and don't try to accomplish too much. A single
test a night might be a good start. Grade the test using the answer sheet
following the test, noting the incorrect answers. Each wrong answer indicates
a skill that may need work. (Note that picture clues may be misunderstood
by a child resulting in a wrong answer.&nbsp;In such cases, give your child
the correct clue and repeat the question.)
<P ALIGN=Left>
Test question numbers correspond to matching lesson numbers. You can use
the answer sheet to make notes and assign lessons. Each lesson consists of
3 pages, ABC. If you wish to assign all pages for that lesson, circle the
letters ABC. As the lessons are completed, "X" out the letters.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<B>Step Three: </B>&nbsp;Print the lessons circled on your assignment sheet.
Each lesson page is topped by a descriptive box with a worm icon labeled
<B>next</B>. Click this worm to go to the next lesson in the series. When
you wish to exit, click the worm icon labeled <B>index</B>. Study a few of
the printed lessons each night. That's all there is to it.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Of course, there is more to reading than phonics. So, lessons covering Word
Structure, Vocabulary and Comprehension complement our reading program. Just
choose a subject, estimate your child's performance level and print the
appropriate placement tests and worksheets. A few worksheets a night with
lots of encouragement can make a big difference. Remember to visit your local
public library for interesting books that will reinforce your child's new
reading skills. It is best to let your child help choose the books, giving
them a sense of empowerment that makes them want to practice reading. If
a book proves too difficult, read with your child and explain how you approach
difficult words or sentences.&nbsp;
<P ALIGN=Left>
To print tests and lessons from Learning Target, go to the Home Page and
click on one of the subjects. Then use the <B>next</B> worm icon to choose
an appropirate grade level. From the resulting index, click a test letter
or a lesson number to display a worksheet. If you like what you see, use
your internet browser <B>print </B>function to print the worksheet. On some
browsers, this is just a button at the top of the screen with a pricture
of a printer. On others, you must click the <B>file</B> tab to pull down
a menu which includes <B>print</B>. If your printer is capable, you may print
in color by choosing <B>print setup</B> and enabling the color options. Setup
also allows you to optimize your black and white output by enabling the grayscale
options. In all cases, you need a graphics printer (like an ink jet or laser)
to reproduce Learning Target pictures and boxes.
