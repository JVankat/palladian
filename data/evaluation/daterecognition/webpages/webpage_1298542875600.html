<P>
Madison helped write the Virginia Constitution (1776),  was a leader in the Virginia legislature (from 1776, where he worked diligently for religious freedom), and was elected to the Continental Congress (1779-1783).  Madison and <A HREF="/history/us/pres/jefferson/">Thomas Jefferson</A> became close friends, probably meeting in 1776 at the Virginia House of Delegates.
<P>
In 1787, Madison was the youngest member of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, <A HREF="/usa/states/pennsylvania/" target="_top">Pennsylvania</A> (this was the meeting at which the <A HREF="/history/us/documents/constitution/" target="_top">US Constitution</A> was written). Madison was an advocate for a stronger central government (years later, he later changed his position, calling for states' rights).  Madison participated in editing the final draft of the US Constitution.  He was the only person who kept extensive notes on this secret convention, and they are now the main record of this historic event.
<P>Madison was elected <A HREF="/history/us/pres/list.shtml">President of the USA</A> in 1808 and in 1812; he served from 1809 until 1817.  George Clinton and Elbridge Gerry were his Vice-Presidents.
<P>Late in life, he worked in the Virginia Constitutional Convention, helped Jefferson found the University of Virginia, and worked against slavery.  Madison died on June 28, 1836 - he was 85 years old.</TD>

John Quincy Adams' father, <A HREF="/history/us/pres/adams" TARGET="_top">John Adams</A>, was the second president of the United States.
<P>
John Quincy Adams was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, on July 11, 1767. Adams graduated from Harvard University in 1787, went on to become a lawyer in Boston, and was elected senator from Massachusetts in 1803.  President James Madison appointed Adams Minister to the Netherlands and later, Russia.  Adams helped negotiate the treaty that ended the War of 1812 (which was fought with Britain).  Adams then became Madison's Secretary of State.  He later negotiated the treaty with Canada that placed the border west of the Great Lakes at the 49th parallel. He then negotiated with Spain, obtaining a treaty that returned <A HREF="/usa/states/florida/" TARGET="_top">Florida</A> to the USA.  Adams also helped draft the Monroe Doctrine, which ended European colonization of the Americas.

After winning the presidency in 1824 (beating Andrew Jackson), Adams' term included prosperity and road and canal building (including the Erie Canal, which connected New York City and the <A HREF="/usa/statesbw/greatlakes.shtml" TARGET="_top">Great Lakes</A>).  Adams lost the next presidential election (Jackson won).  Adams then served in the House of Representatives until his death (1831 until 1848).</TD>

Although he was against slavery, Buchanan let Kansas (a slave state) join the Union - this angered the anti-slavery North.  Buchanan's support of the outcome of the Dred Scott court case (in which it was ruled that Scott, a black man could not obtain his freedom because he was not a US citizen) also decreased support in the North.  Lincoln became President in 1861 after Buchanan left office.</font></TD>
