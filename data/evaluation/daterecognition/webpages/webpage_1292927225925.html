<h5><em>Congratulations to Sarah from Miami for being randomly chosen as the winner of the African CD collection!</em></h5>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://blog.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/301_190.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7702 alignleft" title="Putumayo's South Africa CD" src="http://blog.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/301_190.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="190" /></a></em></p>
<p><em>Dan Storper is the CEO and Founder of Putumayo World Music.</em></p>
<p>With the opening of the Soccer World Cup in South Africa on June 10th, the first on African soil, a new milestone will have been achieved in this country’s remarkable journey. Until 20 years ago, South Africa, with its apartheid policies, was a pariah isolated from the rest of the world. Over the past 20 years, with Nelson Mandela’s moral leadership and intense desire for reconciliation, true democracy for all of its citizens and economic revival, South Africa has become Africa’s leading success story. (Read on for a chance to win some Putumayo CDs.)</p>
<p><span id="more-7700"></span></p>
<p>South Africa’s music has long had an extraordinary impact on the world’s music. In the 1950s, South African Solomon Linda’s “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” became a worldwide hit. In the 1960s, Miriam Makeba’s “Pata Pata” and Hugh Masakela’s “Grazin in the Grass” became top 10 hits around the world. Ladysmith Black Mambazo and South African musical styles provided the foundation of Paul Simon’s album <em>Graceland</em>. <em>The Lion King</em> and other Broadway shows and Hollywood films put South Africa front and center in the 1990s and beyond.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Bholoja.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7703 alignright" title="Bholoja" src="http://blog.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Bholoja-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="159" height="240" /></a>Putumayo’s <em>South Africa</em> CD celebrates the best of South Africa’s extraordinary musical diversity, from Afro-jazz and township jive to <em>mbaqanga</em> and Afropop. The album features legends like Miriam Makeba, rising stars such as Phinda and Nibs van der Spuy and closes with the rousing a capella Soweto Gospel Choir. It also includes a recipe for a vegetarian version of a classic South African dish, Lentil Bobotie, contributed by leading South African chef Amos Diamini. A portion of the proceeds benefits <a href="http://www.ansafrica.org/">Artists for a New South Africa</a> and their work to advance human rights, combat HIV/AIDS, help children orphaned by the disease and educate and empower youth.</p>
<p>Available for free download here, Bholoja’s “Mbombela” is an example of the emerging African singer-songwriter movement. Dividing his time between neighboring Swaziland and South Africa, Bholoja sings this song in SiSwati, one of the 11 official South African languages. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>Note: you can simply listen online using the player below, or you can “right click” to download the mp3 file.</em></p>

I love the whole Putumayo collection of music and already own many of their CDs but NONE of the African ones!  Would really make my day to win this awesome set!  I do not watch sports on TV at all though, so I will not be doing anything to celebrate this event! Sorry!  Hope this still counts!</p>

            			<span class="commenttext"><p>I&#8217;m not a football (as in soccer) fan, but I love world music! I&#8217;d celebrate the World Cup listening to my African collection. I have two Angelique Kidjo albums, one by Kotoja (one of the first Putumayo albums), some Tinariwen (Malian blues rock) and Oliver Mtukudzi (from Zimbabwe).</p>
<p>To celebrate the World Cup in South Africa, I&#8217;d celebrate with some African recipes from Marcus Samuelsson&#8217;s &#8220;Discovery of a Continent&#8221; or Troth Wells&#8217; &#8220;World in Your Kitchen.&#8221; South African bredie is a great vegetarian bean stew with potatoes, tomatoes, wine, and raisins. Of course, Samuelsson has celebratory dishes like chicken marinaded in rooibos tea or a spicy Mozambique fish stew. I&#8217;d be celebrating Africa!</p>

I&#8217;m DC, and the best way, to enjoy the game for an expat is with friends, food and music (music following the soccer game, because while your team plays, you follow in religious silence!)&#8230; As for music, this year I think we will definitely play some African music (Sutu Kun, Ekibobo, Papa Noel, Les Nubiens), but there will be plenty of space for Italian of course (e.g.Max Gazze&#8217;, Daniele Silvestri, Neffa, Tiromancino, Negramaro, etc. etc.)!</p>

            			<span class="commenttext"><p>I celebrate the World Cup 2010 for several reasons.  I demonstrated for Madiba&#8217;s freedom for years in the U.S., all those years ago and to see how far South Africa has come in so little time is truly inspiring.  Madiba truly showed the world the power of one.  This World Cup 2010, newly heralded as recognition of the Rainbow Nation, is positive evidence of Madiba&#8217;s ideas and those of several others from several nations, over a span of generations, that dreams can become reality.  Because of my awareness of the plight of the South African people during apartheid, (capitalization refused), I naturally became familiar with African music, with which I fell in love. To date, it is my favorite.<br />
Sports and music know no cultural bounds, the other reasons I celebrate this World Cup.  We all come together and celebrate our bonds and differences in a joyful manner.  I celebrate the music and also celebrate those with the love of this sport.</p>

I have been to South Africa back in 2004, visiting Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.  It was a trip of a lifetime and I would encourage anyone who is thinking of going to do so!  The sights, people and food were above my expectations.</p>

            			<span class="commenttext"><p>I just moved back from South Africa after working there at a girls&#8217; shelter in Cape Town.  The girls and young women I worked with came from a variety of backgrounds; some orphans, some political refugees, many having had life experiences that grown adults wouldn&#8217;t be able to handle.  I was impressed by their strength, intelligence, and above all their love of music, whether from Xhosa, Zulu, or even Western culture.  One of my best memories is of sitting with them during my first month there and listening to them sing.  The love of music pervades all levels of society in South Africa, and in all of the countries I have been to throughout Africa.  Putomayo always has great CDs and I&#8217;m thrilled that a South African version has been released!</p>

            			<span class="commenttext"><p>I&#8217;m 14 years old and just started listening to Reggae music.  I found an African Reggae CD at Whole Foods and just listened to it &#8211; I really like that the lyrics are in different languages so that I can pay more attention to the music and not get caught up on the words.  The lyrics are more like another instrument.  I like that the songs were more mellow than Jamaican Reggae.  I just got back from a school trip in Costa Rice and the African music reminds me of there.  It would be really cool to win the 5 CDS, &#8217;cause I don&#8217;t have enough money to buy them all.  If I&#8217;m too young to win, you could send them to my mom, Ann Gerard.  Oh, by the way, I do plan to watch some of the World Cup.  It seems more like a country competing, not just a team wanting a paycheck.  It&#8217;s really cool that it is in South Africa.</p>

I first saw Putumayo World Music CDs in the library, I was immediately attracted by the artwork, and I love Africa Music. I love “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”, I did not know its Africa root until now. I also would recommend the sound track of the movie “The Constant Gardener”, original music composed by Alberto Iglesias. The movie was filmed in Africa. The music fits African landscape beautifully. I don&#8217;t follow Scoccer as I did when I was younger, but Congratulations to Africa for the World Cup! Thank you Wholefoods, for sharing the world music and international themes in the community and in your stores. I would love to win the CDs.</p>

It is funny how music can be heard in everything.  Even during the World Cup.  You hear the screams and the awesome sound of the wonderful horns which were almost banned.  That would not have been cool at all. Thank you for the wonderful download.  If anyone could see my Pandora account they would know that I am a lover of music no matter what genre it is.  I truly believe that music is our World Cup, don&#8217;t mean to sound cheesy.</p>

I love different cultures, especially people,food, and music. this CD delivers two out of three; how can you beat that, short of going there?!<br />
On a much somber note, my prayers go out to Nelson Mandela and his family on the loss of his 13 year old grandaughter who was killed in a car accident leaving one of the games.</p>

I love the cds that Putamayo has put our over the years, accumulating about 30 in my collection. My favorites are the afro-jazz and Cuban styles with African influences. They all just make you want to dance and smile.</p>
