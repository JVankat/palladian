<p>Vitamin D3 (Vitamin
1,25(OH)2 D3) is a naturally occurring bodily substance that many believe
to exert a protective effect in <a href="explainingms.html">multiple
sclerosis</a> - both in the development of the disease and in limiting
its progression. It is naturally produced in the skin in response to sunlight
but is also present in certain foodstuffs (particularly oily fish). It
is also available as a dietary supplement from health food stores.
<p>Strictly speaking,
because your body can produce it, Vitamin D3 isn't a vitamin. It's a type
of steroid hormone and among other things, a powerful mediator of immune
function.
<p>D3 is best known
for it's effects on calcium metabolism. Proper levels are necessary to
maintain bone mineral density and serum (blood) calcium levels. This is
especially true among the very young where it is used to treat rickets
and in combination with vitamin A for the treatment of osteoporosis in
the elderly, particularly post menopausal women who are often subject to
fractures due to loss of bone density.
<p>In studies, Vitamin
D has been found helpful against <a href="autoimmunity.html">autoimmunity</a>
for the down-regulation of <a href="Th1immunity.html">Th1</a> and up-regulation
of <a href="Th2immunity.html">Th2</a> cells. It has also been shown to
regulate the neurotrophins NGF (Nerve Growth Factor), NT-3 (NeuroTrophin
3) and NT-4. In addition, D3 has also been found to promote differentiation
and cell death in neuroblastoma (brain tumour) cell lines as well as cancers
in general making it a possible weapon against tumours.
<p>D vitamin supplements
available over the counter (cholecalciferol) and those included in foodstuffs
like milk (D2) are precursors to transcriptionally active D3, actually
to 1,25(OH)2 D3 the active form of vitamin D.
<p><b>1,25(OH)2 D3 is
created by your body in the following way.</b>
<p>UV or sunlight at
between 290 and 315nm and heat on the skin results in the conversion of
a molecule called 7-dehydrocholesterol (pro-vitamin D) into cholecalciferol.
<p>The cholecalciferol
or pre-vitamin then goes through two hydroxylations (additions of hydrated
oxygen atoms -OH). The first usually happens in the mitochondria (a cytoplasmic
organelle) of liver and kidney <a href="endothelium.html">endothelial cells</a>.
This creates the relatively abundant 25OHD3. that's a weak form of Vitamin
D3 which has a sterol or steroid "ring" structure. 25OHD3 then goes through
another hydroxylation, mostly in the kidney's mitochondria, resulting in
1,25(OH)2 D3 which is really the subject here.
<p>These hydroxylations
are also performed by immune system cells under specific conditions. This
"extrarenal" synthesis seems to have an "autocrine" role in certain types
of cellular immune responses which mediate lymphoid cells (both B and T
cells) as well as myeloid cells.
<p>The process by which
solar or U.V. light initiates VD3 synthesis is self limiting, so too much
such exposure is unlikely to ever cause VD3 overdose.
<p>As with all hormones
and other messenger proteins, VD3 is only one part of the story. The communication
requires a means of "hearing" and then acting on the message.
<p>The active form of
D3 has a particular molecular "tail" called a "side chain". That tail fits
receptors in many cells in your body like a key into a lock. These receptors
are called VDR or vitamin D receptors. Fitting themselves into these receptors,
the VD3 molecules might be thought of as flipping switches that, depending
on the cells in question, set any of several processes in motion by allowing
the VDR to interact with a variety of VDRE (Vitamin D Response Elements).
<p>In reality, a VDR
(vitamin D receptor) usually forms a heterodimer with an RXR receptor.
Thats "hetero" as in differing and "dimer" meaning a pair. So the VDR is
almost always really an VDR-RXR joined pair of two different receptors.
The RXR is a receptor that fits retinoic acid
<p>There are many different
VDRE. These "elements" signal sections of the host cell DNA that are "upstream"
of the genetic region being activated. Keeping in mind that every nucleated
cell in our bodies contains our complete genome, it becomes clear that
we need a way to activate the specific sections of those genes pertinent
to the tasks at hand.
<p>These tasks include
regulating serum (blood) calcium levels, stimulating cellular differentiation
and subsequent <a href="apoptosis.html">apoptosis</a> (cell death), as
well as modulating the production of <a href="cytokine.html">cytokines</a>
(messenger proteins) that pass signals within the immune and some other
systems.
<p><b>The role of Vitamin
D3 in Multiple Sclerosis</b>
<p>Multiple Sclerosis
is a neurodegenerative disease of the CNS (<a href="centralnervoussystem.html">the
Central Nervous System</a>.) Both the <a href="myelin.html">myelin</a>
sheathing around nerve tissue and the <a href="axon.html">axons</a> or
tissue themselves which conduct <a href="actionpotential.html">nerve impulses</a>
undergo an attack primarily mounted by the immune system. Over time this
attack leaves scars called lesions which interfere with the transmission
of signals to and from the brain. This immune attack against the "self"
is called autoimmunity.
<p>Epidemiologists have
long observed a geographical north south gradient in MS occurrence. Moving
further from earth's equator, there are more MS cases per capita. And among
populations with similar genetics, those living at very high elevations
are statistically less likely to contract MS than those below who live
beneath a thicker layer of U.V. diminishing air.
<p>Coastal populations
where diets are rich in fish containing D3 are also less likely to have
MS than inlanders in those same regions without fish in their diets.
<p>These findings and
our reliance on sunlight to produce VD3 coupled with its increasingly well
documented immune system modulation have led many in the medical and research
communities to suspect that a deficit of VD3 is involved in the development
of multiple sclerosis.
<p>It is beyond the
scope of this article to fully describe the interactions of VD3 and immune
system elements. If it were even currently possible, doing so would probably
require several volumes. Of necessity, the following is only a few pertinent
lines from a very long play.
<p><b>Here's a snapshot
of an immune system interaction.</b>
<p>An infectious agent
like a virus or bacterium invades the body stimulating a response by the
compliment system, killer T- cell and macrophage attack.
<p>The infectious agent
has molecules on it's surface that the body uses to identify it. These
are called antigens. Macrophage actually engulf and dissolve invaders,
they remove the antigen molecules from the invaders surface and act as
APC (Antigen Presenting Cells) presenting examples of the antigen surface
in order to recruit T and or B lymphocytes which produce receptors that
fit the challenging antigens shape as a means of identifying it.
<p>Next come the production
of two types of cells, effectors and helpers. The helpers are those that
"remember" the invading antigen by multiplying and generating more cells
with surface receptors that fit it. These cells circulate throughout the
body watching for the invaders return appearance. If it reappears, these
cells stimulate the clonal production of both helper cells like themselves
and effector cells which actually attack the challenging antigen.
<p>Various stages of
that process are controlled by messenger proteins called cytokines. There
are over 100 different often structurally unrelated cytokines which fall
into several families such as Interleukins (IL), Interferons (IFN) and
Tumour Necrosis Factors TNF). Cytokines often work by controlling the direction
of genetic transcription leading to immune cell production.
<p>Most cytokines are
very short lived, only working over short distances. Generally this short
existence means that a cytokine acts only on the cell that produced it.
It's called an "autocrine" effect. Those cytokines acting on other cells
exhibit a "paracrine" effect. Usually that means other cells in the immediate
area of the cell producing the cytokine. You'll often see that immediate
area called a "micro-environment"
<p>This is where VD3
enters. VD3 transcriptionally regulates cytokine production leading to
differentiation (lineage maturation) and mitosis (multiplication) of these
immune cells in subtle sometimes complex ways.
<p>For example; 1,25(OH)/2D3
blocks animal models of (autoimmune) diabetes without generalized immuno-suppression.
On the other hand VD3 actually increases the immune response by macrophage
against bacteria. In some studies serum levels of 1,25(OH)/2D3 coincide
with survival rates among those infected by HIV.
<p>MS is typically characterized
as presenting an elevated ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells. VD3 at least partially
corrects that imbalance
<p>VD3 influences ratios
between these T-helpers reducing the over-proliferation of T and B leukocytes.
this is partially caused at the hematopoietic level. that is at the point
of blood cell creation in the bone marrow as well as at the point of leukocyte
maturation in the thymus.
<p>Vitamin D receptors
have been found in both T and B lymphocytes maturing in the medulla of
the thymus.
<p>while glucocortical
steroids limit maturation of many of these lymphocytes through apoptosis,
some of those resistant to glucocorticoids may be stopped by VD3s ability
to signal teir differentiation along a pathway leading to apoptosis rather
than maturity as cytotoxic cells.
<p>Vitamin d receptors
are also found in cells of the lymph nodes and tonsils where VD3 down-regulates
effector cell expression.
<p>By these mechanisms
VD3 actually has a biphasic effect on the immune system. Rather than a
simple downregulation of immune response it blunts generalised over-proliferation
of both lymphocytes and monocytes while sharpening the immune system attack
on specific targets.
