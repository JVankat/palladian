<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">Introduction.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><br>Let’s start with a few specific fabrications about homosexuality! &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><br>Gays would have you believe that their lifestyle is natural, normal and healthy.
    Genetically determined no less. Those who think otherwise are unbalanced hate seething
    bigots who suffer from homophobia. Additionally, they endure significant mental distress
    and chronic ill-<wbr>health brought about by societal rejection and hostility. Gays would
    be free from the troubling chains of self-<wbr>doubt if a profoundly prejudiced society
    was a little friendlier and less censorious. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Homosexual men and women come in all shapes and sizes. &nbsp;Many are well-<wbr>educated and
    occupy managerial or professional jobs enjoying favourable incomes. &nbsp;Indeed, some
    are even gifted with rare talents, whilst others are dull and mediocre. &nbsp;&nbsp;In short,
    just common folk -<wbr> but gay! &nbsp;But, and it’s a big but -<wbr> there’s a hidden dark side.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The best available scientific and medical evidence internationally, demonstrates
    unequivocally, that homosexuals, as compared to heterosexuals, are at increased levels
    of pathology and are inordinately affected by promiscuity, infidelity, substance
    abuse, violence, child sex abuse and psychological instability. &nbsp;A significant minority
    of gays participate in sadomasochism and other unsafe practices. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">As if these problems are not enough, there is then the psychical health issue and
    a shortened life expectancy. &nbsp;&nbsp;Homosexual men and women are disproportionately &nbsp;at
    risk to a range of sexual diseases from HIV/AIDS, any of 40 varieties of HPV, oral
    and &nbsp;anal cancer and a nasty series of sexually transmitted diseases (STI’s) some
    of which are totally indifferent to the much vaunted ‘safe sex’ advice and practice.
    &nbsp;In truth, the only safe sex is -<wbr> abstention, or monogamous intimacy with the opposite
    sex. &nbsp;Western societies generally have little or no interest in either based mostly
    on secular reasoning since morality menaces sexual freedom.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Gay on gay murder is now much more common and increasing, which is largely ignored
    by the medical profession and the national media &nbsp;As will be shown here, some are
    addicted to an insatiable range of sexual behaviours; they call them ‘orientations’;
    that are disturbingly shocking, outrageous and incredibly hazardous. &nbsp;What was once
    labelled a vice is now considered a virtuous variation. &nbsp;Such is the putrefying power
    of a &nbsp;perverse propaganda.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Consider, but briefly, those who actively seek the acquisition of full-<wbr>blown AIDS
    as a means of enhancing their sex life? &nbsp;&nbsp;It is a defiant, macabre and nihilistic
    gesture against death itself, a telling measure of the strength of addiction experienced
    by some gays. &nbsp;Aspiring an erotomaniac liberation, these are the new deluded dysfunctional
    kamikaze junkies of a lawless sexual revolution.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Running parallel with the ‘gay gene’ myth is the falsehood that the homosexual condition
    is fixed and thus incurable. Any attempt to reverse the condition is judged to be
    intensely harmful and deeply damaging. Indeed, any suggestion to the contrary is
    extended evidence of blatant prejudice and chronic homophobia deserving of censure,
    punishment even. Thus, helpful heterosexuals are seen as a humiliating hindrance.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">To understand homosexuality you have to enter a seductive labyrinth of mesmeric make-<wbr>believe
    and fertile fantasy. &nbsp;Take for example the very basic notion of marriage. &nbsp;Importantly,
    a fundamental biological union between a man and women, which usually, but not inevitably,
    functions to produce progeny, without which, society is finished.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Homosexual men and women defy logic and nature when they attempt to mimic it, because
    it is impossible to unite that which is biologically incompatible. &nbsp;Not only is the
    familial genealogy fractured, but also the influence of the male and female sexual
    complementarities that flow naturally from conventional homogeneous unions. &nbsp;Moreover,
    the majority of gay activist reject the concept of marriage and wish to smash it
    as an oppressive institution that inhibits sexual licentiousness. &nbsp;Thus, homosexual
    politics involve profound contradictions and inconsistencies.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">It is interesting to note how few homosexual men and women have availed themselves
    of the provisions for legally binding ‘civil partnerships’. &nbsp;The Governments&#39; initial
    prediction of 62,000 civil partnerships in the first five years was wildly exaggerated
    since only 40,237 have been recorded. &nbsp;For critics, this is not surprising. &nbsp;It should
    also be observed that as the number of civil partnerships get less each year, the
    number of dissolutions keeps inexorably growing. &nbsp;This does not stop homosexual activist
    Peter Tatchell from demanding the fullest recognition for same-<wbr>sex marriage. &nbsp;Meanwhile,
    bisexual Lib Dem Simon Hughes MP predicts the redefinition of conventional marriage
    in the immediate future.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Consider also, gay parenting though largely confined to a few? &nbsp;As far as a child
    is concerned there is no such thing as ‘two Mums’ or ‘two Dads’. It defies the natural
    order of reproductive relationships. &nbsp;The creation of a child strictly depends on
    the fertilisation of the male sperm and female ovum to which offspring is inexorably
    bound forever, to which gays, as a functioning unit, are excluded. Homosexual parents
    fool only themselves at immense cost to each other and society at large. &nbsp;It should
    also be observed that their own narcissistic interests displace that of the child.
    &nbsp;More bizarre still, are those cases reported by an irresponsible media of homosexual
    ‘men’ giving birth to a child -<wbr> a biological impossibility. &nbsp;In all cases, moreover,
    the normal pivotal and personal commitment of parental sacrifice is subordinated
    to work against the welfare of the child, whose concern is removed on the expiatory
    alter of political correctness.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Of course, the gay parenting conspiracy is now facilitated through legal instruments
    in permitting individual tailored pacts to withhold, or otherwise, the true family
    &nbsp;and identity of the child. &nbsp;The legal, social and psychological impact of this experiment
    does not augur well for the future well-<wbr>being of the child since the real family
    background and biography; as opposed to the parodied; can be suppressed. A child’s
    fundamental right to know its true origins is being forfeited. &nbsp;But even in cases
    where this is known, any relationship with the authentic absent parent is likely
    to be somewhat superficial and fleeting because it serves as a threat to the viability
    of the two ‘parents&#39; in the gay adoptive role.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">More chilling, are those cases of gay parents who create disabled ‘designer babies’
    to suit their lifestyle. &nbsp;The case of two deaf lesbians will be considered.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Now comes news that homosexuals Sir Elton John, 63, worth about &#163;175 million and
    his partner David Furnish, 48, have purchased a newborn baby from America at a purported
    cost of &#163;100,000. &nbsp;They had previously been unsuccessful in adopting a baby from
    the Ukraine. &nbsp;John was rejected because of his age and homosexuality.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The child’s family consists of two unidentified mothers and the fathers’ identity
    is being kept secret. &nbsp;It is not known who the true father is – even if either of
    them. If they followed homosexual practices, however, each would have provided a
    specimen of sperm to be mixed up in one sample. &nbsp;Only subsequent DNA analysis will
    determine who the father is. &nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s biological mother donated her egg in a
    process known as ‘gestational surrogacy’ to a mystery surrogate mother. However complicated,
    strange or unfamily-<wbr>like, once a British legal device called a parental order is
    authorised, a birth certificate will be issued identifying both John and Furnish
    as fathers. &nbsp;Thus, the State colludes in a lie, is willing to punish any who disagree,
    and grotesquely crushes civil morality and Christian virtue. &nbsp;So, uniquely, the child
    has two furtive mothers and two feckless fathers, comprising of the biological and
    counterfeit. &nbsp;A couple of decades ago, such a situation would have been met with
    spitting scorn, sharp derision and utter horror. &nbsp;But now, this is the new freaky
    fetishism that has become famously fashionable. &nbsp;It corrupts both culture and morality
    and it does so deceitfully in the name of ‘love’. &nbsp;Conventional parenting which is
    biologically based is now commercialised into a form of contract parenting.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Celebrity friends gushed effusively, congratulating them on becoming a happy family.
    &nbsp;Fulfilling a dream, Sir Elton was “…overwhelmed with happiness and joy.” &nbsp;&nbsp;The subsequent
    BBC news announcing the event interviewed Christian preacher Stephen Green who said,
    “This isn’t just a designer baby for Sir Elton John, this is a designer accessory.”
    &nbsp;Echoing a UN resolution he condemned the arrangement on the basis it was selfish
    to deprive the baby of a mother. &nbsp;More specific, Articles 7 and 8 of the UN Convention
    on the Rights of the child provide for the right to know and be cared for by both
    his/her parents, and the right of the child to preserve his or her identity.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Internet news website </span><span class="Normal-C1">Pink News</span><span class="Normal-C">, the propaganda arm of Stonewall, quickly responded
    furiously condemning Green and readers organised to flood the BBC with complaints
    of homophobia. Green has become the target of gay hate and vituperation simply because
    he has previously thwarted their endeavours. &nbsp;It is also apparent that gays are defiantly
    against free speech!</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The following day Andrew Pierce, consultant editor of the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Daily Mail</span><span class="Normal-C">, an adopted
    gay man, went on to criticise the pair, describing Elton John as an “...ageing, pampered,
    self-<wbr>indulgent millionaire”, &nbsp;reflective of another episode of Tantrum and Tiaras.
    &nbsp;He observed, I can’t help feeling that this decision to become a father is another
    grotesque act of selfishness from Sir Elton, and that the child is a little Christmas
    bauble he and his partner have awarded themselves.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Nevertheless, four months after receiving the baby, John announced his intention
    of having the child’s DNA tested in order to establish who the father is.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Feminist and lesbian campaigner Tammy Bruce has cogently observed, “Today’s gay activists
    have carried the campaign a step further, invading children’s lives by wrapping themselves
    in the banner of tolerance. It is literally the equivalent of the wolf coming to
    your door dressed as your grandmother.” &nbsp;She continues, “By targeting children, you
    can start indoctrinating the next generation with the false construct that gay people
    deserve special treatment and special laws.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In a major American study of donor-<wbr>conceived children, </span><span class="Normal-C1">“My Daddy’s Name is Donor</span><span class="Normal-C">”
    (2010), revealed that young adults conceived through sperm donation are hurting more,
    are more confused and isolated from their families. &nbsp;They fared worst on outcomes
    such as depression, delinquency and substance abuse. &nbsp;Nearly two-<wbr>thirds agree, “My
    sperm donor is half of who I am.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Nearly half are disturbed that money was involved in their conception. More than
    half say that when they see someone who resembles them they wonder if they are related.
    Almost as many say they have feared being attracted to or having sexual relations
    with someone to whom they are unknowingly related. Approximately two-<wbr>thirds affirm
    the right of donor offspring to know the truth about their origins. And about half
    of donor offspring have concerns about or serious objections to donor conception
    itself, even when parents tell their children the truth.&quot;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Another study of 19,000 young people, </span><span class="Normal-C1">Parental Cohabitation and Adolescent Well Being,
    </span><span class="Normal-C">richly demonstrates that children with biological parents do best.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">About 2,000 babies are born in Britain each year using donated sperm, eggs or embryos.
    &nbsp;This will include a sizeable number of lesbians. &nbsp;Of course, these are only the
    ones the &nbsp;Human Fertility and Embryology Authority document. &nbsp;A considerable number
    of lesbians obtain sperm donations informally from commercial and sometimes dubious
    sources. &nbsp;Many travel abroad to destinations like Spain, the Czech Republic and America.
    &nbsp;Often, large sums of money are involved. &nbsp;British sperm donors no longer have a
    right to anonymity but sperm trading is now an international enterprise. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The rapid growth of homosexuality over the last fifty-<wbr>years is glaring testimony
    to the fact that gay rights are a cunning deception over unambiguous logic and established
    sound science. &nbsp;This is particularly so, since the fundamental right to engage in
    homosexual activity is not deeply rooted in British traditions, history, science,
    education, the arts, ethics, morality, religion or culture. From another point of
    view, the current exponential rise of homosexuality undermines any genetic component.
    It is too sudden and swift to be genetically determined. Genetic mutations take about
    30 generations -<wbr> that’s 900 years. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">This will be a shock to some, but history teaches that homosexuality is conditioned
    by social, cultural and political forces and is self-<wbr>taught. &nbsp;The ‘gay gene’ idea
    is the biggest lie of the century. &nbsp;It’s simply amazing how many quite intelligent
    people have fallen for it, but then, the bigger the lie repeated enough will eventually
    stick. &nbsp;Interestingly, it was Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels who perfected the
    ‘Big Lie’ technique which was based on the principle that a lie, if audacious enough
    and repeated sufficiently will be believed by the masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Apart from politics, homosexual attraction is determined by a combination of familial,
    environmental, social and biological influences. For others, homosexuality develops
    due to negative or traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse when young. &nbsp;Research
    demonstrates a disproportionate number of gays have suffered sexual ill-<wbr>treatment
    when young by adult homosexuals.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">With eager Government support, Britain’s foremost homosexual political pressure group
    -<wbr> Stonewall -<wbr> have perfected the big lie tactic by the bucket load. &nbsp;Created in 1989,
    it grew from the initial Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and performs a political lobbying
    function with governments and big business. &nbsp;It is an agitprop organisation that
    is knee-<wbr>deep in a swamp of hogwash and fabrication. &nbsp;It pushes unadulterated propaganda
    disguised as serious science based research to foment its crippling twisted cause.
    &nbsp;Stonewall’s ‘research’ is substantially concerned with the simple exaggerated introverted
    opinions of other gays. &nbsp;In short, they carry out an opinion poll and deem it substantive
    research.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">They use small samples that are self-<wbr>selecting and demonstrably biased in favour
    of current homosexual opinion. &nbsp;They invent and juggle statistical variables in order
    to overrate the levels of societal homophobia. &nbsp;Unable to establish any casual link
    between societal attitudes and violence towards gays, they disingenuously invent
    it by association. &nbsp;Its chief executive, Ben Summerskill, as will be demonstrated,
    makes some spectacular claims about hate and violence experienced by homosexuals,
    largely based on dexterous speculation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, leading politicians and
    even the Equality and Human Rights Commission have been duped by their hype. This
    is given close scrutiny here on our page on Victimhood, because it urgently needs
    to be exposed.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Stonewall was the creation of actor Sir Ian McKellen, journalist Matthew Parris,
    Michael Cashman MEP, Simon Fanshawe, author and broadcaster and others. &nbsp;It was motivated
    by a daunting desire to defeat Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#39;s Section 28, which
    inhibited local councils from encouraging homosexuality in schools. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The first executive officer, Angela Mason, was a committed radical feminist and lesbian,
    a lawyer by profession she was tutored in cultural Marxism and revolutionary politics.
    &nbsp;She eventually became head of the Women’s Unit during the Labour Government in the
    Department of Trade under Harriet Harman MP. &nbsp;There she spearheaded legislation that
    would embrace homosexual rights with gusto, thus casting Christian and other rights
    to one side. &nbsp;Eventually, laws granting special protective rights to homosexuals
    was enshrined in the Equalities and Human Rights Act 2010, which Labour got through
    by the skin of their teeth before their government finally collapsed prior &nbsp;to a
    general election. &nbsp;Mason is currently one of the Commissioners with the Equality
    and Human Rights Commission, which is run by gay-<wbr>friendly Trevor Phillips, a former
    broad-<wbr>left president of the National Union of Students and long-<wbr>time friend to homosexual
    Lord Peter Mandelson. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Each commissioned report by Stonewall; and we will examine them here; stress two
    important facts. &nbsp;First, it portrays society as being riddled with homophobic hate
    and bullying, second, that this hate directly results in unremitting violence against
    gay men and women. Thus, gays become the new oppressed -<wbr> the hapless victims of irrationality
    and profound prejudice. &nbsp;Encouraged by dubious statistical reports emanating from
    Mason’s department, then juggling the figures even more with the help of a journalist
    at the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Observer,</span><span class="Normal-C"> Stonewall eventually claimed there were 6%, or 3.6 million homosexuals
    in our society.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">However, a fresh authoritative Government Report, The Integrated Household Survey
    of 450,000 households late in 2010 unequivocally concluded only about 1 in 100 men
    were gay. &nbsp;Indeed, this confirmed the findings of an earlier two-<wbr>year study in 2008.
    This evidence, together with that of the professionally expert Health Protection
    Agency, point to some 500,000-<wbr>600,000 men who have sex with men. &nbsp;Thus, gay, lesbians
    and bisexuals make up about 1.04% of the population. &nbsp;For a persecuted minority,
    the reports states gays were twice as likely to have a university degree and nearly
    half were in professional management jobs.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Homosexual activists at home and aboard rapaciously condemned the findings stating
    most gays and lesbians were simply too frightened to come forward and identify themselves
    . </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The other influential homosexual pressure group, which is even smaller and funded
    unsystematically, is Outrage. &nbsp;It was created by Peter Tatchell in 1989 and from
    it, Stop the Murder Music (SMM) and an AIDS awareness arm -<wbr> ACT UP. &nbsp;&nbsp;He is a former
    member of the original GLF whose radical political idealism stems directly from extreme
    feminism and the American Black Power movement. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">An Australian immigrant, but now naturalised, he fled to Britain to avoid army conscription
    during the Vietnam War, which he didn’t support. &nbsp;He is a tireless, four-<wbr>decade campaigner,
    who is lionised by many sections of society. &nbsp;He has also drawn criticism from others
    for his ultra-<wbr>liberal approach.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He became a 19-<wbr>year-<wbr>old activist in the GLF, which was formed on 13 October 1970,
    in the basement of the London School of Economics -<wbr> then the home of revolutionary
    student politics. &nbsp;Disregarding the law, he lived with his 16-<wbr>year-<wbr>old lover Peter
    Smith, in a flat in Sheperd’s Bush, London. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Today, many glowing accolades are made about him, even by Christian organisations
    that applaud his campaigning zeal. &nbsp;He’s very much an up-<wbr>front and direct-<wbr>action
    man. &nbsp;Even Spectator journalist Rod Liddle thinks he is, ‘brave, principled and decent....a
    voice of pure principle’. &nbsp;The media are drawn; like the common fruit fly to fetid
    jam; to his belligerent confrontational tactics when diplomacy is discarded. &nbsp;Others
    resent this approach and think it damages their cause. &nbsp;He, to the contrary, thinks
    it has produced big dividends for gays and lesbians. &nbsp;Without the purple coiffeured
    bouffant hairstyle, he’s an </span><span class="Normal-C1">enfant terrible </span><span class="Normal-C">Quentin Crisp at war with a vengeance.
    &nbsp;Twice on the fringe of national politics, he’s made little or no impact.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He regularly achieves praise and honour as his popularity grows. &nbsp;The latest example
    is the 2010 award of an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Brighton. &nbsp;His
    appeal draws wide public support and is based on the laudable notion of “Human Rights,
    Democracy, Global Justice”. &nbsp;The latter gives his campaign an international edge,
    particularly for gays in Africa, Eastern Europe, even Muslims. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Thus, his cause is dignified, legitimised and even ennobled. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">On the other hand, he has been seen in public wearing a gaudy black revolutionary
    beret adorned with the subversive red star. The imagination quickly turns to the
    fictional urban guerrilla ‘Citizen Smith’, played by Robert Lindsay, in the late
    1970’s British television comedy sitcom in which he raises his clenched fist defiantly
    declaring “Power to the People”. &nbsp;This is not to suggest, however, that he is a lazy,
    unemployed dreamer and petty criminal! &nbsp;The more sinister evocation is that of Che
    Geuvara who fought in the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and later Bolivia. &nbsp;An infamous
    terrorist but now internationally hailed by the Left as a Hero of the People. Tatchell
    is our latest and he’s got the black insurgent beret to prove it!.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Privately though, he appears an unhappy man claiming his council home is fortified
    under siege from potential external threat and violence. &nbsp;He claims that he has suffered
    post traumatic stress disorder for the last twenty years, &nbsp;He works about 70 hours
    a week but only receives an annual income of &#163;8,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;A salary is less important.
    &nbsp;He claims he gets about 500 emails each day and faithfully responds to each one.
    That’s 3,500 emails each week.! &nbsp;If he spent just 2 minutest daily on each email,
    that, in itself, would be about eight hours work. &nbsp;&nbsp;Bricks have been thrown through
    his windows, his home has undergone three arson attacks and a bullet shoved through
    the letterbox. &nbsp;&nbsp;He states he’s received a dozen death threats. &nbsp;Remarkably, he claims
    he’s been beaten up 500 times and now; due to falling health because of it; has eased
    up a little. &nbsp;Assailants have attacked him with fists, iron bars, hammers, sticks,
    rocks, bricks and bottles. &nbsp;He does not report these matters to the police because
    he thinks they are ‘useless’. &nbsp;He also claims he’s been arrested 300 times. &nbsp;Unlike
    the other Antipodean and </span><span class="Normal-C1">eminence grise</span><span class="Normal-C">, Dame Edna Everage, Tatchell claims he has
    refused inclusion in the Queen’s Honours List., a Peerage even. &nbsp;To the casual observer
    he appears immersed in a solitary victimhood to a degree not shared by other gays.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In September, 2010, a small group of gays honoured him with their own version of
    a blue plague outside his home in Bermondsey, London. &nbsp;This is tempting fate,since
    it identities his home more accurately for any who would wish to harm him.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Nevertheless, when his case is properly examined his cause is unequivocally concerned
    mostly with gay sexual rights. &nbsp;His writing technique is clear though subtle. &nbsp;This
    is done by surrounding his gay rights demands with other rights that most of us would
    have difficulty in rejecting. &nbsp;That way the proverbial elephant imperceptibly eases
    itself into the bedroom.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">For example, take the human rights of children. &nbsp;Who could sensibly argue against
    that?</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">On the downside, however, few consider the proposition that as children’s rights
    are secured, parental rights are diminished in equal measure! &nbsp;In fact, it’s already
    happening, particularly in schools and especially in relation to sexual matters like
    education, contraception and abortion. &nbsp;The aim of the Left is to remove parental
    choice from the equation.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Tatchell’s narrative, however, concentrates on the highly disputable rights of children
    to enjoy sex, even with grown-<wbr>ups. &nbsp;Indeed, he even boasts of friends who have done
    exactly that, without any harm to themselves or others. It is the reaction of society
    and the law that causes the problem! &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He wants to legalise early intimate relationships, even though he says he does not
    wish to encourage sex at an early age. &nbsp;He observes, “ Consensual sex should not
    be stigmatised or criminalised, not for young people, not for adults, not for anyone.”
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of doing so is seen as persecution and not protection for children.
    &nbsp;Another strongly held view is that the age of consent be lowered. &nbsp;&nbsp;Some highly
    contentious reasons are given for doing so. &nbsp;When he argues for the lowering of consent,
    this is smoke and mirrors, for what he truly desires is the abolition of any legal
    restrain on children to experience sex, as and when they want to.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He fails to acknowledge the current law regarding sexual conduct and children. &nbsp;The
    Sexual Offences Act 2003 is not intended to prosecute mutually agreed sexual activity
    between two young people of a similar age, unless it involves abuse or exploitation.
    &nbsp;Young people between the ages of 14 and 16 who mutually agree sexual activity do
    so because of the permissiveness of the law. &nbsp;This is considerably removed for any
    notion of persecution. &nbsp;A boy or girl under 13 years of age cannot consent and the
    current law serves to protect their innocence and vulnerability. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">This website will also reveal he is a school bully extraordinaire, something which,
    when it comes to so-<wbr>called gay kids, is close to his marred campaign. &nbsp;He browbeats
    school children into submission during his talks, by misquoting research findings
    to silence them if they don’t agree with homosexuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">O</span><span class="Normal-C">ver the years, Tatchell has been consistent in his arguments about intergenerational
    sex and evidence for this is found in an article he wrote for a book entitled, </span><span class="Normal-C1">Betrayal
    of Youth: Radical Perspectives on Childhood Sexuality, Intergenerational Sex and
    the Social Oppression of Children and Young People</span><span class="Normal-C"> – CL Publications 1986, currently
    out of press. &nbsp;It was edited by Warren Middleton, hailed as one of the founding fathers
    of the paedophile movement in Britain who was instrumental in the creation of the
    infamous Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), and the journal </span><span class="Normal-C1">Understanding Paedophilia</span><span class="Normal-C">.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">According to Middleton, their aim is to eradicate any inhibition that restricts the
    sexual and social rights of children. True liberation, for children is the right
    to say yes to sex. &nbsp;Their collective view was that if society supported adult/child
    sex then any damage would hardly be an issue. &nbsp;The North America Man/Boy Love Association
    (NAMBLA) endorses their view. &nbsp;As will be shown, both NAMBLA and PIE share a common
    bond.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">There is no evidence whatsoever that Tatchell is a paedophile, but there are persuasive
    indications that he supports what they do. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Tatchell confirms this in his own words when he states, “Shouldn’t we be preparing
    and educating children for greater rights and responsibilities at an earlier age;
    perhaps critically re-<wbr>examining our concept of childhood and viewing children more
    as young citizens?” &nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat simplistically, he goes on to question the age of
    consent to ask if the law should be applied to consenting victimless sexual activity.
    &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Today, Tatchell wants to distance himself from this book, but as can be shown his
    message then, is exactly the same today. &nbsp;It’s plastered all over his website and
    in his daily utterances! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">His reasoning is tendentious, unproblematic and simplistic, conditioned by unrealistic
    assumptions about the nature of sex and the efficacy of the law. &nbsp;His assertions
    lack any empirical base and thus reflect his personal gay-<wbr>oriented opinion and ambition.
    When he does produce exact evidence it is often atypical or anecdotal, which is fraught
    with difficulty. &nbsp;He assumes that immature children can make sensible decisions about
    highly sensitive and complex sexual issues. &nbsp;Some may have no moral compass and others
    fear of being labelled homophobic should they resist uncertainty. &nbsp;He is preoccupied
    with the restrictions of the law, thus revealing his fundamental background in the
    politics of dissension and discord. The aim is to confuse rather than cleanse. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Let’s be clear about his affiliations and his background, because in reality he is
    a self-<wbr>confessed sexual subversive whose neo-<wbr>Marxist background in the Gay Liberation
    Front/Angry Brigade is well known. &nbsp;There is a picture of him on his website holding
    a placard stating, “Gay Proud and Angry”. The significance of this will be explained
    shortly. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">His ideological stance is that homosexuality should not exist in parity or harmony
    with heterosexual society, but that it should smash traditional sexual mores as a
    precursor to dramatically and irrevocably changing it to produce a new social/sexual
    order. &nbsp;In short, his intention is to transform conventional society to bring about
    conditions where anything goes. &nbsp;This reflects pure Marxist political/cultural dogma.
    &nbsp;He remains true to the revolutionary imagination of the GLF whose message was “Two,
    Four, Six, Eight -<wbr> Copulate and Smash the State”, and rejects the “...narrow, introspective
    mainstream gay right agenda”, represented by other campaigning groups like Stonewall.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">As a true red, he’s already in the bed.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He will have supported the 1971 </span><span class="Normal-C1">Gay Liberation Front Manifesto</span><span class="Normal-C"> that aimed to target
    the family structure as a priority because it causes homosexuals to feel ashamed
    and guilty. &nbsp;It is heavily influenced by radical feminism. &nbsp;The Patriarchal Family
    is seen as the source of hostility because it reinforces the male and female role.
    &nbsp;It brazenly states, “Gay liberation does not just mean reforms. &nbsp;It means a revolutionary
    change in our whole society.” &nbsp;They aimed to target schools, the Church, media, words
    [linguistics], employment, law and psychiatry.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Since that time Tatchell has consistently followed that destructive line, so it is
    no surprise he rejects the deterministic gay gene idea. &nbsp;The case for change is not
    biological but political, and his political endeavours are subsumed within the broad
    banner of human rights. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Nevertheless, his views on the determinants of sexuality are confusing. &nbsp;He argues
    against a gay gene on the basis it does not explain the great variety and flexibility
    of sexual behaviours,. &nbsp;He cites lesbianism and bisexuality as instances. &nbsp;It’s obvious
    he hasn’t heard about the difference between optional and obligatory homosexuals.
    Writing in the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Guardian</span><span class="Normal-C"> in 2006 he states, “Much as I would love to go along with
    the fashionable ‘born gay’ consensus (it would be very politically convenient) I
    can’t. &nbsp;The evidence does not support the idea that sexuality is a fixed biologically
    given.” &nbsp;He has also observed on his internet. blog, “The truth is that nurture appears
    to be more important than nature when it comes to the formation of sexual orientation.”
    &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">So, relationships between child and parents, formative experiences, cultural mores
    and peer pressure are of greater significance. What is the lesson here? &nbsp;It is that
    peer pressure can induce homosexuality in people. &nbsp;Gays readily accept a heterosexual
    becoming a gay, but never the other way round, which explains the unremitting intensity
    of their opposition to reparative therapy.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">On the other hand, he takes a contradictory stance in suggesting genes and hormones
    do influence sexuality which is largely based on the recent theoretical assumptions
    of two gay activists who have written a book. &nbsp;Speaking of Radio Five Live in January
    2011, he made it clear that the evidence suggests ‘very significantly’ that genes
    plus hormonal factors are major determinants of homosexuality. &nbsp;“They&#39;re the major
    determinants. &nbsp;So no one can choose to be gay, or choose to be straight.” &nbsp;Whichever
    way one looks at his views, Tatchell wins.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In 1997 he wrote a startling letter to the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Guardian</span><span class="Normal-C"> newspaper defending a book about
    ‘Boy Love’. &nbsp;He saw it as a “courageous” effort. When he was later criticised for
    this by the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Daily Mail</span><span class="Normal-C"> columnist Peter Hitchen’s, in 2010, he justified himself stating
    his interest was in protecting free speech. &nbsp;He also pointed out that several of
    &nbsp;his personal friends had gained “great joy” from having sex with an adult, some
    as young as nine-<wbr>years-<wbr>old. &nbsp;None felt abused. &nbsp;He went on, “While it may be impossible
    to condone paedophilia” he observed, “it is time society acknowledged the truth that
    not all sex involving children is unwanted, abusive and harmful.” &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Hitchen’s might have been more shocked if he had looked closer to what was involved.
    &nbsp;Tatchell was supporting the work of Professor Gilbert Herdt, who has made a career
    from anthropological research into the sexual initiation of young boys with their
    elders among the Sambia [a pseudonym] tribe of Papua New Guinea. &nbsp;He’s a big hit
    with the gay community. &nbsp;Tatchell observes, “Far from being harmed, Prof Herdt says
    the boys grow up to be happy, well-<wbr>adjusted husbands and fathers.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Indeed, he thinks that Herdt offers a rational and informed perspective of sexual
    relations between younger and older people, “...where consenting inter-<wbr>generational
    sex is considered normal, beneficial and enjoyable by old and young alike.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Let’s take a brief peep into Sambian culture. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The initiatory cycle into manhood starts when boys are between 6 to 10 and consists
    of 6 stages until eventually they marry and become fathers. &nbsp;The boys are removed
    from their mothers at an early age to an isolated area in the jungle. &nbsp;They are then
    violently ritually bled from the nose with a sharp cane and this results in loud
    exalted war cries. &nbsp;They are instructed by older bachelors in the ways of oral copulation
    and warned they will not become proper men if they fail. &nbsp;Attempts at escape are
    punished. &nbsp;Erotic advances are made and homosexual activity takes place. &nbsp;Repeated
    acts of fellatio are necessary.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Sexual copulation is intensified as the boys are instructed to ingest as much semen
    as possible. &nbsp;This will make them fierce warriors. Herdt describes this as the “...crazy
    ride from boy to man” and loftily attributes this to a “semen conservation theory.”
    &nbsp;It becomes the alternative to mother’s milk. &nbsp;As the boys become adolescents they
    are the new bachelors who now inseminate other boys. &nbsp;Again they are severely beaten
    and nose bled. &nbsp;This is a purifying ritual from female contamination. &nbsp;Homosexual
    relationships are brief and non-<wbr>permanent. &nbsp;They eventually enter into an arranged
    marriage from which children are born.. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">This is nothing short of ritualised barbarity inflamed by a fear and hatred for women
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Tatchell’s trendy tribe transcends both tragedy and trauma..</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Today, Papua New Guinea is the epicentre of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific region. &nbsp;Fear
    spreads among the population fuelling accusations of witchcraft against women who
    are tortured by mobs who hold them responsible for the epidemic. &nbsp;Thus, AIDS patients
    have been thrown off bridges or left isolated to starve to death.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">We can see from this that Tatchell, in pressing the sexual ethics of the Sambian
    tribe, is now ascribing to a non-<wbr>genetic causation.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">If their sexual conduct was genetically determined, it would not be possible for
    them to switch from homosexuality to heterosexual relations with woman to have children.
    &nbsp;Transition would be impossible. &nbsp;But according to Tatchell, the boys grow up happy
    and are well-<wbr>adjusted husbands and fathers. &nbsp;The more he sticks to his gene theory,
    the more he gets bogged down in contradiction.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Tatchell may publicly abhor paedophilia, but he shows an in ordinately intense interest
    in the subject matter in stressing its potential for enhancing sexual relations between
    minors and adults.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">On the other hand, on his own website he writes of “subverting the status quo” which
    involves, “Making trouble, defying convention, undermining normality, and questioning
    authority.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Interviewed by </span><span class="Normal-C1">Gay News </span><span class="Normal-C">in 2008 he boldly stated, “…we are sexual subversives who
    unravel the straight machismo that underpins all relations of oppression and exploitation.”
    &nbsp;Indeed, “Queer liberation” is aimed at the whole of humanity to free men and women
    from sexual subjugation. &nbsp;It thus exposes his global aspirations for domination.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Further, commenting on an internet animal rights website called abolitionist-<wbr>online
    in 2009, he saw queer liberation rights as “…offering a subversive critique of the
    orthodox often suffocating models of masculinity and femininity.” “Forget assimilation”,
    he brazenly observes, “Be yourself, not what heterosexists want us to be i.e. like
    them.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In an additional interview by </span><span class="Normal-C1">The Independent </span><span class="Normal-C">in 2010 he stated contemporary homosexuals
    are conservative reformers but that, “The core message of GLF was that genuine queer
    emancipation involves changing society, rather than adapting to it.” &nbsp;This requires,
    “…a full-<wbr>scale cultural revolution, to overturn centuries of male heterosexual domination.”
    &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Celebrating 40 years since the creation of the GLF, Tatchell self-<wbr>absorbingly wrote
    in the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Guardian</span><span class="Normal-C"> that , “In contrast to the gay law reform movement, GLF&#39;s strategy
    for queer emancipation was to change society&#39;s values and norms, rather than adapt
    to them. We sought a cultural revolution to overturn centuries of male heterosexual
    domination and thereby free both queers and women.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">This puts a very different light on his motivation. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He rejects conventional morality, traditional values and the centrality of the family
    as the core issue of a liberal democratic society. He wishes to undermine the male
    and female modalities and the institutions that underpin their value and importance
    in civil society.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Since his aim is a full-<wbr>scale revolution of ‘queer liberation’ not ‘gay rights’ it
    is undemocratic. &nbsp;Because he firmly rejects assimilation, his stance is manifestly
    totalitarian and given that he wishes to subvert the status quo, he is clearly anarchic.
    &nbsp;His sentiments are unquestionably revolutionary with no time for peaceful transformation
    of attitude and behaviour. &nbsp;It’s a smash-<wbr>and-<wbr>grab plan in the hope everything will
    turn out right. &nbsp;This is a mockery of Human Rights, Democracy and Global Justice.
    &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Somewhat curiously he supports a street preacher’s freedom of expression to associate
    homosexuality with sin, yet denies the right of an elderly couple running a bed and
    breakfast to express their religious ethics. &nbsp;Instead, he thinks they should be prosecuted
    by the law for failing to accommodate a pair of gay men. &nbsp;Thus, the equalities of
    homosexuals are more pressing than the freedom of expression of Christians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This,
    again, calls into question his appeal to human rights since the rights of homosexuals
    are more equal. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In his recent public condemnation of the Pope and homosexual abuse in the Catholic
    Church, Tatchell is exposing himself as a hypocrite. &nbsp;First, he is the enemy of the
    church, any church, and second, he is sympathetic to the sexual demands of paedophiles.
    As a dangerous sexual subversive revolutionary, he is out to destroy anything that
    is ethically wholesome or morally good on the basis that it represents an oppressive
    evil. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He does not seek parity, but dominance! &nbsp;His narcissistic dictum is that some people
    are more equal than others. &nbsp;On the face of things, he cunningly appeals to uplifting
    liberationist aspirations, but the real aim is to ensnare and subdue. &nbsp;His corroding
    view of conventional morality in the form of the family is highly prejudicial and
    his ultimate aim is to demolish it. &nbsp;Thus, his political and social base is not just
    contradictory -<wbr> it is corrosively catastrophic.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He is the equivalent of the wiley old sly fox that advises the hospitable hens on
    chicken coop safety by making it more fox-<wbr>friendly. The result is carnage -<wbr> the gory
    gnashing of teeth and the furious crushing of bones.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">If current popular assumptions about homosexuality are in part driven by poisonous
    Marxist ideology, which will be discussed more fully shortly, they are also based
    on fraudulent research carried out in the 1940’s by the American Zoologist Dr. Alfred
    Kinsey at the Kinsey Institute for Sexual Research. &nbsp;He was based at the Indiana
    University and received financial support from the RokeFfeller Foundation. He posed
    as an impeccable neutral scientist in a marriage of convenience to promote a picture
    of respectability. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">His forged analysis eventually led to major changes in American society involving
    law, science, medicine, education and politics. &nbsp;In fact, it contributed to a profound
    moral revolution that spread from America to the rest of the world. &nbsp;The magnitude
    and scale of Kinsey’s lies reverberated onto a largely gullible world. &nbsp;But not anymore!
    &nbsp;Seminal research by Dr. Judith Reisman is pivotal in exposing the many perfidious
    lies associated with Kinsey. &nbsp;This included the so called 10 percent gay population
    myth, his encouragement of pornography, homosexuality, paedophilia, abortion and
    incest.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Kinsey’s deceptive and criminally associated research </span><span class="Normal-C1">Sexual Behaviour in the Human
    Male</span><span class="Normal-C"> (1948) provided a body of so-<wbr>called experimental evidence demonstrating that
    children are ‘orgasmic’ and capable of sexual pleasure from infancy. This fuelled
    the paedophilia movement. He also held that morality and sexual mores were conditioned
    by cultural forces which were detrimental to homosexuality and paedophilia. &nbsp;He was
    a moral revolutionary whose mantra was fornicate early, often and with great gender
    variety.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">His documented sex ‘experiments’ had been carried out by known paedophiles, criminals
    and child molesters. This involved up to 2,035 children. The youngest was 5-<wbr>months
    old. He also used data obtained by Rex King, a serial criminal pederast, who had
    sexually molested and aroused 800 children. This amounted to the formalisation of
    child molestation on a massive scale. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Much of this data was also secretly obtained from a former World War Two Nazi doctor.
    Fritz von Balluseck worked in a Polish concentration camp and was encouraged by the
    Nazi SS to carry out sex experiments on children. He cruelly raped many. It was subsequently
    shown that he had been molesting children for 30 years when he was denounced by the
    German press after he was convicted for the rape and murder of a 10-<wbr>year old child.
    He was described as “...the most important pedophile in the criminal &nbsp;of Berlin.”
    &nbsp;Not only did he sexually assault his own daughter but he had also raped the 11-<wbr>year-<wbr>old
    son of a vicar and forced the boy to write down his experiences for Kinsey’s records.
    &nbsp;At the time the American press where noticeably silent about the connection between
    von Balluseck and Kinsey. An FBI investigation came to nothing because Kinsey had
    obstructed it and his colleagues covered it up.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Of the 5,000 male respondents who made up Kinsey’s research base 2,446 were convicts,
    1,003 homosexuals, 50 transvestites.117 mentally ill, 650 sexually abused and 342
    “other”. &nbsp;This yielded 4,608 n=Aberrant and 873 n=Normal subjects. Clearly, he was
    not concerned with the average American on the Manhattan omnibus. &nbsp;Instead, he dug
    deeply into deviancy in a big way to portray a loose-<wbr>living immoral American man.
    &nbsp;It was manifestly a comprehensive lie intended to pave the way for the normalisation
    of homosexuality itself. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">He was an omni-<wbr>sexual compulsive/obsessive masochist. He masturbated fixatedly with
    a ‘toothbrush’ inserted in his urethra. He is known to have also circumcised himself
    with a pocket knife without the advantage of any anaesthetic. And violent sexual
    behaviour might have contributed to his early death. &nbsp;It is essential to closely
    look at Kinsey and his legacy because he truly is the father of the modern gay movement.
    &nbsp;Many gays think Harry Hay is, but history shows that Hay and his Mattachine Society
    took many of their ideas from Kinsey.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">If the 2010 general election has depressingly demonstrated anything, it is that,
    with rare exception, all the major and minor political parties have now defiantly
    signed up to the sodomy lobby. &nbsp;In the case of the Conservative Party, in particular,
    this is proving to be a major shift in Conservative ideals. &nbsp;</span></P>

    public health measures to counter the onward expansion of life-<wbr>threatening cankerous
    sexual diseases; currently &#163;700 million just for HIV; are increasingly proving inadequate
    and the dilemma gets distressingly worse. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Doctor Gwenda Hughes, head of the Health Protection Agency STI section warned in
    2010 of high rates of STI’s among gay men. &nbsp;In the last 10 years, for instance, diagnosis

<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Terrence Higgins Trust’s Chief Executive Sir Nick Partridge said: &quot;It’s staggering
    that almost half a million people each year are affected by preventable sexually
    transmitted infections. Gay men continue to top the list, accounting for two thirds
    of syphilis and over a third of gonorrhoea diagnoses last year, while being only
    6% of the population.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">At the same time researchers in infectious diseases at the Ghent University in Belgium
    warned that despite a heightened awareness of HIV in the West, reckless sexual behaviour
    among young men who have sex with men is fuelling the HIV epidemic in Europe and
    the UK. &nbsp;They had isolated the genetic viruses of 500 patients -<wbr> male and female,
    gay and straight, Caucasian and non-<wbr>Caucasian between 2001 and 2009. &nbsp;They found
    that almost all white, male, gay and young men were most infected. They also tended
    to have other sexual diseases like syphilis, suggesting a disregard for condoms and
    risky sexual practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;In France, for instance, the rate of HIV is 200 times greater
    in the gay community than it is in the heterosexual.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Gays have been very successful in making homosexuality a civil rights issue when
    in fact it is truly a public health issue. &nbsp;In 1994 it was reported in the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Journal
    of Public Health</span><span class="Normal-C"> that the average expenditure per death for AID’s cases was &#163;289.753,
    whereas it was only &#163;60 for heart diseases. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Preliminary results from a small Spanish study in December 2010 indicates that 75%
    of gay men are carrying the Human Papilomo Virus (HIV). &nbsp;This is a significant marker
    for HIV and it causes cervical cancer in women and penile cancer in men. Similarly,
    a 2007 American study showed that homosexuals are spreading a new highly-<wbr>infectious
    and extremely dangerous bacterium called MRSA USA300 which can only be treated with
    rare drugs. &nbsp;The bacterium manufactures toxins that can cause necrosis -<wbr> the death
    of surrounding tissue.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">It is useful to observe that the original generic acronym for AIDS was gay-<wbr>related
    immunodeficiency disease or GRID, until gay activists in America pressured the medical
    establishment to switch the term.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Since the HIV/AIDs pandemic started in the early 1980’s, 25 million people have died
    globally and merely controlling HIV infections could cost $733 billion over the next
    20 years. &nbsp;Although gays like to portray HIV as an equal opportunity disease -<wbr> that
    is anyone can acquire it, medical science firmly concludes that men who have sex
    with men (MSM) are the most vulnerable.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">British citizens have no reason to feel smug. &nbsp;In the 1970’s contaminated blood was
    given to patients that had been obtained from HIV/AIDS-<wbr>ridden prisoners in American
    jails. &nbsp;At least 4,500 patients, mostly haemophiliacs, were infected with HIV or
    hepatitis C. &nbsp;It was an on-<wbr>going scandal that the British Parliament took forty years
    to settle the matter of compensation. &nbsp;In January 2011 Health Secretary Andrew Lansley
    announced the Government had allocated &#163;130 million. &nbsp;In the meantime, of course,
    1,500 patients have unfortunately died.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">So much for wrong gay rights!<br>&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">What has been achieved by the homosexual community, nevertheless, amounts to a </span><span class="Normal-C1">tour
    de force</span><span class="Normal-C">. These rights are rooted in a sophistry of false reasoning that depends
    on hidden bogus assumptions and the use of calculated confusing polysemous terms
    the most common of which are sexual orientation, heterosexism, diversity, multi-<wbr>culturalism,
    inclusiveness, discrimination, homophobia, victimhood and tolerance. These form the
    very basis of political correctness, or, as we will see, Cultural Marxism, which
    inverts both rationality and truth with the ultimate intention eventually of destroying
    our liberal democracy. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Consider, for a moment, the accusation of homophobia? &nbsp;This is commonly defined as
    an irrational fear of homosexuality or homosexuals. &nbsp;In truth, any idea of irrationality
    or fear should invoke pity, help and understanding, not scorn and punishment. &nbsp;But
    that is no part of gay politics. &nbsp;Criticism of homosexuality, however stated, is
    never seen as a measure of personal or religious morality, or of traditional cultural
    virtue. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Religious ethics, in particular are condemned as a form of hate simply for rejecting
    homosexuality as a sin. &nbsp;&nbsp;Christians are free publicly to discuss all forms of sin
    with the one exception of homosexuality. &nbsp;That is utter taboo. &nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel
    that an insidious pressure is being brought to privatise the Christian religion as
    a precursor to criminalizing it.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Even science based evidence has to be mocked and undermined if it questions the substance
    of homosexuality as defined by gays. The irrationality of the homosexual world is
    projected upon that of the heterosexual and it is the latter that is perceived as
    the problem to be scorned and stamped upon. &nbsp;Conditioned by vacuous value-<wbr>judgements,
    homosexual vengeance is sought through a vendetta of vitriol and vituperation. &nbsp;There
    is no surprise then, telling the truth draws scorn, derision, hate and even violence
    or its threat.<br><br>It may be suggested that gays want to normalise homosexuality, but
    that misses the point because what they ultimately seek is the universal classification
    of heterosexuality as deviant. Homosexual activists are already looking at the possibility
    of making homophobia a mental disorder describing it as an ‘intolerant personality
    disorder’. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Far fetched, you might think? Well, consider this? Right now, under existing legislation,
    if you are considered politically incorrect regarding anything to do with homosexuality
    you could be branded a criminal. For example, if a person uses even temperate words
    or behaviour about homosexuality that is subjectively perceived by anyone to be evidence
    of hate, the matter can now be formalised within the criminal law. The element of
    hate does not have to be proved. Currently, it might be problematic to define one
    as a deviant, less troublesome a criminal facing seven years in jail. Such is the
    knife-<wbr>edged imperative which drives the ravaging sexual politics of our society.
    On the face of it, this may appear a small and unimportant departure from the traditional
    conventions of British law, but it has, nevertheless, a serious potential for crushing
    freedom of thought and expression.</span></P>

<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Unnoticed, ‘Big Brother’ Britain has now smashed its clunking bruising fist into
    the very heart of primary and secondary schools; with, of course, the best of intentions;
    in an attempt to curb racist, homophobic or transphobic attitudes in the playground.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Thus, local and central government, directed by five abstruse pieces of turgid legislation,
    countless reams of detailed and boundless guidance and an army of nit-<wbr>picking officials,
    now closely supervise childish playground banter, which, if politically incorrect,
    &nbsp;is formally recorded on a central database at Whitehall for unending analysis. &nbsp;Persistent
    unacceptable behaviour will receive particular attention. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The view is held that the real aim is to identify parents who may be teaching their
    children inappropriate attitudes – the ‘bigots’ and ‘racists’ of tomorrow. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In March 2010, ten-<wbr>year-<wbr>old Peter Drury, a pupil at the Ashcombe Primary School in
    Westonsuper-<wbr>Mare, Somerset, casually called his friend a ‘gay boy’. &nbsp;Following a
    complaint from another mother, details were officially entered in the schools ‘hate
    register’ as a homophobic remark. &nbsp;He will now be monitored on a computer database
    in central London for the rest of his school days for any signs of prejudice. &nbsp;Protestations
    from his parents that he barely knew about sex, let alone homosexuality, made no
    difference. Headmaster, Peter Turner, subsequently shunned all enquiries, referring
    instead to the North Somerset Local Authority.</span></P>

<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Dr Michele Elliot, director of the children’s charity Kidscape, said, “Children are

<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Less than a year later, the Manifesto Club obtained additional information under
    the Freedom of Information Act about what was happening in our schools. &nbsp;Their report
    revealed that for the year 2008-<wbr>2009 10,436 primary schoolchildren and 41 at nursery
    school, had been labelled racist or homophobic over minor squabbles, &nbsp;A further 29,659
    incidents were reported in secondary schools. &nbsp;Head teachers who fail to report any
    cases are criticised for under-<wbr>reporting. &nbsp;Ominously, schools maintain records of
    incidents, many of a petty nature and if they &nbsp;are asked for a pupil reference by
    a future employer or a university, the record will be disclosed which could blight
    a child’s future for life.</span></P>

<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">In 1986 the United States Supreme Court rejected the view that homosexual sodomy
    be viewed as a fundamental privacy right no different from marital sexual relations.
    So, 17 years later, the gay movement then claimed constitutional minority status
    protection as a ‘suspect class’ defined by immutable characteristics. They played
    what might be described as a gay race card. They deceitfully substituted the notion
    of identity in order to obfuscate their behaviour. Today, the gay movement refutes
    the obvious fact that homosexuality is based on behaviour – sodomy. Rather they view
    it as innate. Note this is a legal, social and political opinion, not science. <br><br>Moreover,
    although gays now insist they were born that way, they simply cannot provide irrefutable
    evidence since none exist. Indeed, a gay activist writer of limited talent and fame
    named Karoly Maria Kertbeny anonymously coined the word ‘homosexual’ in 1868 to replace
    the term ‘Knabenshander’ or defiler of boys. He wanted to remove the criminal association
    that terms like sodomite and pederast expressed. Its origin therefore is inspired
    by obscure journalism rather than definitive biology. &nbsp;Notwithstanding, since then,
    homosexual propagandists have continued to deny any association between homosexuality
    and paedophilia and it continues to this day.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Incidentally, some 30 years later the term heterosexual was first published, but
    it was not until the 1960’s that it became common. This, of course, coincided with
    the development of the gay movement in the USA and Europe. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Kertbeny is now an iconic figure in the Hungarian gay movement. This, despite the
    current trend by homosexual men and women to remove the term ‘homosexual’ from our
    lexicon on the basis they find it offensive and degrading since it suggests an abnormal
    medical condition susceptible to treatment -<wbr> hence the word gay’, or more indefinite
    -<wbr> LGBT -<wbr> now further mockingly refined by some as ‘Gilberts’. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The dispute about defining words within the gay community continues to this day with
    the latest example of attempting to disassociate homosexuality from paedophilia.
    &nbsp;This correlation, however, not only has a long established history, but it can be
    currently seen within our justice system in the form of crime statistics of men who
    rape young boys. &nbsp;Some horrific cases are included on this website. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">New psychiatric labels are now introduced which will have the effect of confusing
    matters even further. &nbsp;Indeed, that may be the intention of some gays. &nbsp;So, for example,
    hebephilia is a condition which refers to sexual attraction of children in the early
    years of puberty, which in the case of boys, is 11 to 13 years of age. &nbsp;Ephebophilia
    refers to the sexual attraction of later adolescent children and teleophilia to a
    sexual interest in pubescent youth &nbsp;It is argued that there is a need to be more
    age specific in defining these terms because paedophilia relates more strictly to
    prepubescent children. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">A useful example of this denial of homosexual paedophilia is illustrated in a televised
    debate on BBC1 </span><span class="Normal-C1">The Big Question </span><span class="Normal-C">in 2009. &nbsp;The discussion was about the scandal of
    priests in the Catholic church in Ireland who had sexually abused children, &nbsp;The
    extent of the abuse was disclosed in the 2,565 page </span><span class="Normal-C1">Ryan Report </span><span class="Normal-C">which concluded “Sexual
    abuse was endemic in boy’s institutions.” &nbsp;It recognised that girls were subjected
    to sexual abuse and stated, however, that such abuse was not systemic. &nbsp;</span><span class="Normal-C1">&nbsp;</span><span class="Normal-C">The circumstances
    of the boys was different. </span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C1">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The debate was fairly low-<wbr>key until Father John Owen, an aide to the Archbishop of
    Cardiff and a Catholic chaplain at Cardiff University, was introduced. &nbsp;He claimed
    that most of the abuse on boys was done by homosexual priests. &nbsp;Whereupon gay panellists
    became agitated and condemned him in ardent terms. &nbsp;This drew considerable support
    from the audience. &nbsp;One, Colm O’Gorman, a gay man living with a male partner and
    now extensively known as the 14-<wbr>year-<wbr>old victim of rape by a Catholic priest later
    went on stridently to describe the priests views as “...Ill-<wbr>informed, ignorant, corrupt
    and dishonest.”</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Subsequently the Archdiocese of Cardiff distanced itself from the remarks and Father
    Owen retired. &nbsp;This is rather odd since the Congregation for Catholic Education in
    2005 released an I</span><span class="Normal-C1">nstruction Concerning the Criteria for Discernment of Vocation
    </span><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;In that document the Vatican clearly states that individuals with deep-<wbr>seated homosexual
    tendencies must not be permitted to enter seminaries and be ordained as priests.
    &nbsp;This is a recognition that homosexual men have a problem.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Now, if homosexuals are keen to redefine their behaviour into an ambiguous characterisation,
    they ought to be a little more cautious. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">The concept of ephebophilia was first introduced in 1906 by homosexual Mangus Hirschfeld
    in Germany. &nbsp;Interestingly, he located them within the homosexual population. &nbsp;Serious
    consideration is now being given to have these new categories enshrined within the
    forthcoming revision of the </span><span class="Normal-C1">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
    </span><span class="Normal-C">(DSM-<wbr>5) which is due out in 2013.. &nbsp;These terms have only recently been found in
    any dictionary or formal diagnostic system. &nbsp;They are seen as novel terms in the
    forensic context resulting in controversy in psychiatry, psychology, law and criminology.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">At the present time only paedophilia is formally recognised as a mental disorder.
    &nbsp;Whereas, none of the oth er defined categories are. &nbsp;Moreover, to date, American
    courts have also rejected submissions based on them. &nbsp;Some American psychiatrists
    are already warning of the unintended consequences of endorsing these conditions
    formally. &nbsp;Indeed, efforts to include them are seen as a quintessential example of
    special interest groups to promote a pseudoscientific construct to advance their
    ends. &nbsp;Some psychiatrists take the view that a small group of government experts
    intent of making hebephilia a mental disorder to legitimate the indefinite incarceration
    of men who have committed culturally repugnant acts with young children and who do
    not meet the diagnostic criteria of other established disorders. &nbsp;It is feared that
    if hebephilia was included in the diagnostic manual it could lead to offenders being
    jailed for longer periods and the manual itself would become discredited.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">It is interesting to note that transsexuals met with initial resistance for inclusion
    by the gay movement, but finally made it despite an ongoing undercurrent of disapproval.
    &nbsp;The coalition Government has promised them big changes in society to accommodate
    their proclivities. &nbsp;Moreover, new evidence is now slowly emerging of new ‘sexual
    orientations’ seeking their rightful place alongside the LGBT, which include polyamorists,
    pan, boy-<wbr>lovers, BDSM or kink and zoophilia.<br><br>It is suggested here, that gays are apparently
    just normal men and women who become conditioned by addictive homosexual tendencies.
    They have failed to resist or openly courted variable discordant pathological sexual
    urges that breach normative social, psychological and cultural standards. &nbsp;Just like
    heterosexuals, homosexuals are born chromosomally as either male XY, or female XX.
    &nbsp;There is substantial biological evidence that men and women are hard-<wbr>wired as a
    distinct sexual category with one exception – the asexual, intersex, androgynous
    or hermaphrodite, of which there are several distinct types. &nbsp;Here the chromosomes
    are typically confused.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Gay activists continued attempt to establish a biological basis for homosexuality
    is becoming increasingly difficult because they face an impossible challenge. A study
    in 1995 found that between 99.7 and 99.9 percent of the genes of any two unrelated
    people, gay or not, lesbian or not, bisexual or not and transsexual or not, are the
    same. Nevertheless, geneticists have established linkages to some 1450 biological
    conditions like physical diseases and think it is impossible directly to link a gene
    to behaviour. These finding drives a coach and horse through the claim for any homosexual
    gene.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Psychologists generally agree that heterosexual development is not genetically determined.
    &nbsp;It is largely determined by environmental influences. &nbsp;Thus, if heterosexuality
    results from a learning process that involves relationships with parents and peer
    groups which include highly individual experiences, sexual encounters and repeated
    behaviours, then so does homosexuality. &nbsp;This explains why there is such a large
    variety of heterosexual and homosexual practices among cultures and even within them.
    &nbsp;Hence in some cultures homosexuality is unknown and in others it has been obligatory.
    &nbsp;Indeed, one can even trace a significant variability of homosexual behaviours over
    the last 50 years. &nbsp;Dangerous practices that were virtually unknown several decades
    ago such as fisting (insertion of hand/forearm into the anus) and rimming (anal/oral
    contact) are now common. &nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Notice also, that some males are more susceptible to homosexual behaviours when confined
    to a strictly masculine environment, that; on leaving; are quickly abandoned. &nbsp;These
    are known as ‘optional’ homosexuals who are differentiated from ‘obligatory’ homosexuals
    who permanently feel a psychological compulsion for same-<wbr>sex sex. &nbsp;&nbsp;Public schools,
    prison and the armed forces may be such examples. &nbsp;If heterosexual or homosexual
    behaviours were genetically determined they would be practically identical in all
    societies and on a permanent basis. &nbsp;Indeed, what anthropologists find is that behaviours
    are culturally mandated in some and culturally proscribed in others, which accounts
    for a hugely complex diversification.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">It is useful to note that distinguished American Professor Edward O Lauman and others,
    who reported on their seminal research in 1994 </span><span class="Normal-C1">The Social Organization of Sexuality</span><span class="Normal-C">
    remarked on the fluidity of behaviours associated with homosexuality. &nbsp;They observe,
    “...homosexuality is a complex multidimensional phenomenon whose salient features
    are related to one another in highly contingent and diverse ways.” &nbsp;Similarly, the
    British Health Protection Agency which monitors, HIV prevalence among homosexuals,
    find great difficulty in identifying homosexuals as a distinct group of individuals.
    &nbsp;They are instead a fluid group that emerges as a result of a shared behaviour, changing
    over time with no obvious or implicit demographic or cultural characteristics such
    as those that define ‘young people’ or ‘black African’.<br>&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Dr. Neil Whitehead is a reputable American research scientist who has written over
    120 published scientific papers. His book </span><span class="Normal-C1">“My Genes Made me do it</span><span class="Normal-C">” (1999) is based
    on a comprehensive 13-<wbr>year review of over 10,000 scientific papers and publications

    at most is minor.&quot; Genes determine the body’s structure and function and not behaviour
    or attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;The gene’s function is biochemical. &nbsp;This book is freely available

<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Both homosexual gene researcher Dr. Dean Hamer and gay activist brain researcher
    Dr. Simon LeVay now reject the idea that homosexuality is solely rooted in biology.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Other compelling scientific studies of monozygotic or identical twins who have identical
    genes fail to show any overwhelming biological factors which induce homosexuality.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Outside of rape, all sexual behaviour is voluntary involving a conscious choice but
    the existence of such desire does not justify the act. Otherwise, adultery, incest,
    polygamy, paedophilia, extreme sadomasochism and bestiality would be acceptable.
    So it is right that certain harmful desires be suppressed. <br><br>Gays claim they have a
    sexual orientation towards someone of the same sex, a lesbian towards other women,
    a bisexual to both sexes, a transsexual, transvestite or transgendered towards the
    opposite inner sex. In doing so, they deliberately exclude an unlimited number of
    other sexual orientations because questions would shift from a recognition of orientation
    to one of conduct and it would quickly become a serious public health and safety
    issue which society would want to regulate and control. Indeed, homosexual activists
    are permanently engaged in a grotesque, bizarre masquerade in stressing their sexual
    orientation, but the fact remains -<wbr> it is not who they are (identity), but what they
    do (tendency) that really counts.<br><br>Therefore, a distinction must be drawn between a
    person’s orientation and their conduct – the desire and the action. Conduct, more
    especially that which is addictive, has serious health implications, whereas orientation
    or desire, if not acted on, is less harmful to society. This explains why gays feel
    it necessary to distance homosexuality as much as it can from paedophilia and many
    other really damaging sexual activities.<br><br>Additionally, it’s interesting to note that
    the decision by the American Psychiatric Association to reclassify homosexuality
    in 1973 was not done on the basis of medical science. It was achieved through political
    persuasion and the power of winning a vote that it was not a mental disorder. Again,
    nebulous persuasive politics ascends the rigour of methodological science. Nevertheless,
    transsexualism, or to give its current appellation. Gender Identity Disorder (GID)
    or gender dysphoria remains still classified as a psychological disorder.<br><br>Such alarming
    doom-<wbr>laden and apparently outlandish claims deserve particular attention.<br><br>Hence, the
    intended purpose of this website is to counter the substance of the many assertions
    made by homosexuals or their apologists. It is to reveal the sheer duplicity and
    orchestrated falsehoods that accompany the overstated assumptions made by homosexual
    men and women. <br><br>For that purpose, this non-<wbr>religious, non-<wbr>commercial and wholly independent
    website draws together a collation of serious resource material. Indeed, much of
    the evidence to test several issues about homosexuality comes from the gay community
    itself. <br><br>This first part is a commentary that covers the current position within a
    British context. The remainder consists of a series of reference materials that reflect
    a wider dimension in stating the case against homosexuality. These same sources have
    also helped shape and inform this current critique.<br><br>What are the consequences for
    the individual person as well as the wider community and why is it no longer a medical
    disorder? Certainly, medical science has never rigorously established that it is
    not, so what explains the current scientific assessment? Although a great deal has
    been documented about homosexuality, crucial efforts by the scientific community
    to establish its aetiology have been consistently rejected. Apart, that is, from
    flawed ‘research’ by homosexual practitioners/scholars, or their apologists, who
    clearly have an axe to grind. This despite the medically established fact that homosexuality
    involves life-<wbr>threatening behaviour with an addictive component which has serious
    health implications. <br><br>A subsidiary aim of this website is to defend our common ideals
    about the traditional family which radical homosexuals find threatening and offensive.
    There is little doubt they intend to destroy it. More important, since much discourse
    within the homosexual community involves an increasing concern for children&#39;s ‘human
    rights’ within the context of a fabricated homophobic victimhood, particularly in
    schools, there is a pressing concern that this should also be properly addressed.
    <br><br>Recognising that not all homosexuals are so disposed, we have an important duty of
    care to protect innocent children from the advances of predatory gays who see youth
    as their greatest prize. Even Jack Straw MP when Home Secretary said in 1998 that
    he did not favour gay adoption and that homosexual couples should not be ‘awarded’
    children merely to enhance their status. “We should not see children as trophies”,
    &nbsp;he telling said in a remarkable admission. <br><br>Notwithstanding, four years later he
    was instrumental in forcing through gay adoption. Subsequently, as the Secretary
    of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor he boasted before Parliament of major legislative
    changes embracing homosexual rights. He rejected the view that ‘...people who were
    gay or lesbian were told by the state that they had dangerous tendencies.’ This change
    amounted to a political and moral upheaval. It was a calamitous betrayal against
    the welfare of children of today and tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;Straw simply endorsed the bumf and
    puffery of homosexual fiction that had long abandoned the respected tradition of
    established medical science. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>We need to examine the nature of this sudden shift
    in opinion because the ‘dangerous tendencies’ claim most certainly has a congruence
    within the homosexual context and always has. Why? It’s exactly what homosexuals
    tell us no less, quite apart from the substance, validation and methodological rigour
    of voluminous scientific findings and research.<br><br>Moreover, according to British health
    experts, homosexuals suffer significant mental health problems. Research carried
    out by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 2004 found that 43 percent of homosexual
    men and women had mental disorders. Problems included sleep disturbance, panic attacks,
    depressive moods, compulsive behaviour or obsessive thoughts. Thirty percent had
    attempted suicide. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Imagine for a moment, if these sombre findings were attributable to the work-<wbr>place
    or other social institution it would quickly be closed down. &nbsp;Instead, the problem
    is not only ignored, its causation is supported in the name of human rights.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Homosexuals like to indulge in more inventive fabrication here by claiming their
    psychiatric problems result from general hate filled antipathy by the ‘heteronormative
    breeders’ or normal heterosexual members of society who indulge in critical homophobia.
    However, in common with many other international studies, this research can find
    no causal link between the problems associated with homosexuality and public discrimination.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, important separate independent epidemiological research elsewhere has unequivocally
    demonstrated that homosexuals in gay-<wbr>friendly countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands,
    Norway, Sweden and New Zealand suffer just as much mental health problems as those
    living in the USA where homosexuality is questioned.</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></P>
<P class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Remarkable that we now add to that stress by permitting gay adoption. This could
    add to their problems and intensify the vulnerability of children’s health who will
    experience tangible psychological harm, increased maladjustment and sexual confusion.
    Evidence for this is validated by a preponderance of sound empirical research carried
    out throughout the world which the liberal political elite ignore. &nbsp;In their collective
    delusion they apparently have more love for homosexuals than they do children. This
    amounts to a clear abandonment of responsibility. &nbsp;<br><br>The purpose here, however, is
    not to scold but to inform and educate. But when necessary, criticism should rightly
    be responsible, reasonable and resolute. The aim is clarity not cloudy thinking –
    truth not truculent intolerance! <br><br>By infiltrating our religious, civic and state institutions,
    the gay lobby has created a universal super hoax. Using stealth and deception they
    claim that homosexuality is a normal healthy alternative life-<wbr>style. In society&#39;s
    rush not to offend homosexual behaviour, most well-<wbr>meaning people fail to recognize
    that every advance for the homosexual agenda comes at the expense of rapidly shrinking
    freedoms of religion, speech, press, conscience and association.<br><br>Indeed, we currently
    face a pernicious sexual revolution that is solely conditioned by an unstable set
    of hazardous sexual cravings of a minority interest. The magnitude and scale of this
    challenge is unsurpassed in human history. &nbsp;Reason enough, it might be suggested,
    to look forebodingly to the future with palpable trepidation. &nbsp;&nbsp;But before we do
    that, we need to look at the past to understand, how it is, that we have arrived
    at the current position. &nbsp;We first need to look at the consequences of neo-<wbr>Marxist
    ideology.</span></P>
