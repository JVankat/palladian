 	<h4>International College of Dentists Convocation - Friday, October 8, 2010</h4>

<p>Thank you for that generous introduction, Ted.  I think Ted may have been feeling especially warm today, because two of his and Brenda's children, Tiffany and Deuce, are among our new Fellows.  Congratulations, Ted and Brenda, Tiffany and Deuce!  </p>

<p>Does this mean you get the family plan on membership dues? </p>

<p>Everyone, good afternoon!  It is great to be here in Orlando, and great to join you for this convocation.  I want to start by congratulating all the Fellows.  </p>

<p>The ICD Fellowship is one of the profession's highest honors, and I know your induction means you put your skills and your heart and soul into your work.  I also want to recognize all the family members here.  These Fellows couldn't have built their careers without your love and assistance, as I know from my family's supportive role in my own career.  Everyone here should be proud. </p>

<p>Ted asked me to talk about leadership.  You wouldn't be ICD Fellows if you didn't already know a thing or two about leadership within dentistry.  So I thought I would talk about leadership outside the profession. </p>

<p>In a word, we badly need more of it.  Our country and, indeed, the world are experiencing difficult times.  From local communities to the United Nations, there are more stresses than I have seen in a generation.  Dentistry plays a lead role in modern health and in modern life, but dentists themselves - well, we remain largely in the wings.  We are one of society's most respected professions but dentists - as a whole - do not do enough for society.  As our top dental professionals, you here today are best qualified to step onto the main stage and change this situation. </p>

<p>Dentists are as well-credentialed, well-educated and as well-compensated as lawyers, physicians and members of the other learned professions.  But we have a strange and abiding tradition of holding back from civic engagement. </p>

<p>Let me quote a couple of lines addressed to dentists from someone outside the field... </p>

<p>"Although your professional and individual standings and standards, ideals and ideas are of the highest and best, you are not of the highest, best and greatest type of citizens.  The dentists don't take an interest in the community life... We find doctors there; of course we find many ministers there, priests and rabbis, and God save us, we find plenty of lawyers there, but we do not find the dentists." </p>

<p>I took this quote from a U.S. dentistry magazine called "The Dental Summary: The Magazine That Helps."  It was published in December, 1915.   </p>

<p>Everything has changed in dentistry in the past century.  The nylon toothbrush hit the market in 1938.  Fluoridation began in 1945.  John Borden invented the high-speed drill in 1957.  Unfortunately, this quote still rings true.   </p>

<p>Most everyone knows about U.S. Sen. Bill Frist, the physician from Tennessee.  But how many recognize the name of Charlie Norwood, the U.S. House member from Georgia who was such a tireless promoter for the Patient's Bill of Rights?  And though he has not been the only Congressman-dentist, Rep. Norwood, who served for 12 years until his death in 2007, is easily dentistry's most prominent politician in recent memory. </p>

<p>Experienced men and women across the professional landscape have been shanghaied to serve as advisors to the George W. Bush or Barack Obama administrations.  Condoleeza Rice, lawyer.  David Axelrod, journalist.  Paul Volcker, economist.   Howard Dean, Physician.   </p>

<p>I cannot think of a dentist who has served in a similar senior advising capacity in any recent presidential administration.  I recently met with Vice President Biden at the White House and several reporters told me it has not happened in recent memory for a dentist to have such access to national government. </p>

<p>Here in Florida, we have 7,000 dentists.  Just one of them serves in statewide elected office: Rep. Alan Hays, from Umatilla.  I thought about tracking down how many lawyers we have, and how many serve in elected office, but I didn't want to spoil the day! </p>

<p>Dentists aren't just absent from politics, they're also lightly represented in other public or private leadership roles.  Searching for examples, I finally checked Wikipedia in desperation.  </p>

<p>There, I found a list of dentists described as having quote-unquote "a degree of notability."  They included a dentist listed as a "renowned spear fisherman," another who was "possibly, the Father of Flag Day," and the guy who invented the wooden golf tee! </p>

<p>I know there are some important exceptions.  Dentists have a few Hall of Famers, such as Paul Revere and Zane Grey.  And we are represented, to a certain degree, on city councils and school boards.  </p>

<p>We definitely have our share of local heroes.  Dentists like Marvin Gillum, recent mayor of Manassas, Virginia, who died early this year.  The Washington Post eulogized Dr. Gillum as "integral thread in the Manassas community" who was a true "Virginia gentleman." </p>

<p>But, it's clear that even at the local level, dentists are not as prominent as you would expect in light of their educational and professional status. </p>

<p>I asked a notable dentist one time why more dentists weren't involved in politics.  His answer was, "You know why?  Because we're too honest to play politics."  There's a grain of truth to that, but we need to get over it.  As the profession evolves, our absence from public life only becomes more damaging. </p>

<p>In the movie, "Little Shop of Horrors," Steve Martin plays a demonic dentist whose terrified patients cling to the ceiling as he gulps nitrous oxide and goes nuts with his drill.  Remember that scene?  The camera captures him from inside patient's mouth.  Martin sings "I thrill when I drill a bicuspid." </p>

<p>I guess it is funny, but I think it is also a point of reference for us.  "Little Shop of Horrors" was released in 1986.  It captures the fear that people used to have about dentists.  Even then, our image as purveyors of pain was on the way out, and I think today it is not at all how the public thinks about our profession. </p>

<p>Our problem today is that we remain inward-looking at the very time we should be outward-looking.  </p>

<p>This is increasingly clear as we see what's happening in medicine. </p>

<p>Practically every day, a new study emerges about, in the words of the Mayo Clinic, "the intimate connection between overall health and oral health."  Periodontal disease has been linked to heart disease and premature birth, and it makes diabetes tougher to control.  </p>

<p>Historically, dentists have done a great job improving dental health through public fluoridation and preventive care.  In fact, we've done a lot better at it than our colleagues in medicine. </p>

<p>The findings on dental health and overall health open a whole new vista on diagnosis, treatment and healthy living.  It is really important to pursue and act on these changes!  </p>

<p>It will not be sufficient if we just talk about it within the dental profession.  We need to bring the discussion to medical and public health circles, and we need to lead the discussion there. </p>

<p>Dentists have a unique perspective because we are health care professionals who do not rely on managed care.   </p>

<p>We are the experts on the nation's dental needs.  So when President Obama last year convened a summit of health care providers and failed to include a single dental organization among the 80 invitees, dentists rightly felt ignored.  </p>

<p>But if we are honest, part of the blame for our limited visibility rests with us.  As the healthcare debate continues, and the discussion is really just beginning, let's contribute what we know we can to the conversation. </p>

<p>If you think about where we are in this country, it's clear that our skills as dentists are valuable not just in health care, but across the board.  As community leaders we can have a lot to say. </p>

<p>Today more than ever, dentists have to be lifelong learners.  They're medical professionals and business people.  They're management and marketing experts.  Their livelihoods hinge on ethics and reputation.  It's a pretty impressive package, if you think about it, in a time when the nation is practically crying out for leadership at all levels.
I am a pediatric dentist.  Before I became president of the University of Utah 12 years ago, I spent most of my career in dental education.  I can't tell you how much I have relied on what I learned as a dentist during my tenures at the University of Utah and at the University of Florida. </p>

<p>I promise, if you've managed a difficult 3 year old child in the dental chair, dealing with the faculty is a cakewalk! </p>

<p>Thanks to the growth of esthetic dentistry and the emerging ties between oral health and overall health, dentists are more visible than ever.  Do we really want to restrict our talents, our abilities and our vision to ourselves?  </p>

<p>That's not only bad for the public, it's also bad for the profession. </p>

<p>People in this room are well aware of the key challenges facing dentistry including independent practice by non-dentists, federal and state reimbursement adjustments; licensure and regulation... I could go on. </p>

<p>The American Dental Association and state dental associations are great advocates, but there can be no substitute for dentists themselves serving in public office or in other advocacy roles. </p>

<p>I mentioned Rep. Hays from Umatilla earlier.  If you ask him about his legacy, he'll tell you he counts among his achievements a 2006 law that opened the door to Florida Medicaid funding for partial dentures.   </p>

<p>Rep. Hays said the obvious: "There is no one in elected office who knows better how to run a dental practice or how to act on legislation related to the practice of dentistry than a dentist." </p>

<p>Another reason to pursue a public role is less tangible.  Let's call it happiness. </p>

<p>The chair of the UF College of Dentistry Advisory Council is a UF alum who operates a multi-million dollar practice in Palm Beach County.  Dr. Larry Grayhills has never run for elected office, but he has been a huge booster of the Boys and Girls Club of Palm Beach County, Palm Beach County youth soccer, and is very active in his religious community.  His wife is a breast cancer survivor, and he is also heavily involved with Susan G. Komen for the Cure. </p>

<p>In his stressful and busy life, Dr. Grayhills relies on community work for a sense of purpose.  He said, and I quote, "People must have a passion for a cause.  Without one, they are just existing."
For the cynics here, let me give you a more down-to-earth example of Dr. Grayhill's passion for his community. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, the City of Juno Beach began using an unmarked camera van to trap speeders.  The van would snap a photo of offenders' license plates, and the city would mail the owner a $125 civil violation.  Dr. Grayhills never got a robo ticket, but he felt the city was more keen on piling up revenue than improving public safety. </p>


<p>So Dr. Grayhills made a sign, "Speed Trap Ahead," and set himself up on a street corner a few blocks from where the van was parked.  What must have been an unprecedented video of a protesting dentist drew swarms of media.  The public response was so swift and adamant in Dr. Grayhills' support, the city canned the speed van.  </p>

<p>Dr. Grayhills says that every time he goes out to eat, people recognize him.  I am not going to take a position on speed vans, but you know what?  If more strangers wanted to thank dentists for public service, it wouldn't be a bad thing for the profession.   </p>

<p>Terri Dolan, dean of the <a href="http://www.dental.ufl.edu/">University of Florida College of Dentistry</a>, tells me today's dental students have grown up in a tradition of community service from their high school and college experiences.  They come to dental school naturally public-minded.  And I know we emphasize community leadership and service more than ever in dental education.  In fact, today, well over a third of UF dental students graduate having completed an international humanitarian educational exchange programs. </p>

<p>So, as these students graduate and get established, the profession will slowly become more public spirited.  But let's not wait.  You, the ICD Fellows, are at the pinnacle of your careers or headed there.  You are in a position now to advance this cause. </p>

<p>Put down the handpiece and pick up a bull horn; cancel your staff meeting and go to a community meeting; augment your professional office with an elected one.  Stand on a street corner if you must!  It will be a good thing for you, the profession and the public.  </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
