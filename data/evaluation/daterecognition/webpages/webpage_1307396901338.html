            The tradition of birthday parties started a long, long time ago somewhere in Europe.&nbsp;
            People thought that on a person's birthday evil spirits were attracted to them.&nbsp; In
            order to protect them from harm, family members and friends brought with them good
            thoughts and wishes.&nbsp; Bringing gifts and being together helped to&nbsp; take away the
            evil spirits.<br>

            only family members and close friends only because this birthday is<br>
            more for the parents than for the child. At age 1, a child doesn't understand the concept
            of &quot;Birthday Party.&quot; He or she is getting a lot of attention---which is all a
            1-year-old wants or understands anyway. You should not go overboard on presents because
            too much could scare or confuse a child. You should consider getting specialty items such
            as a plate that says &quot;First Birthday,&quot; a 1-year-old candle, and possible a table
            cover that everyone could sign with fabric paint to have as keepsakes that can someday be
            shown (or given to) to your grown child. <br>

            do not recommend having a clown or playing any games that require a blindfold over a
            child's eyes such key due to the fact either can scare children at this age. Remember your
            child has just turned 3, and the playmates are around that age. They are still not able to
            understand fully structured games very well. They only know if they do something good or
            better than other children, everyone will give them attention. Again I suggest you collect
            keepsakes.</font></font></b></p>

            children should now be ready for a &quot;real&quot; party. I suggest four or 
            five playmates. 4-year-olds are ready now for party decorations, but 
            I suggest you do less and save your money for the big number &quot;5&quot; 
            birthday (or buy decorations that you can put away and use again). 
            Games such as Musical Chairs, and carrying a hard boiled egg on a 
            spoon to the finish line without dropping it relay race can be 
            appropriate, but remember that games will be played and finished 
            much sooner than you think. Consider having a few of your child's 
            favorite videos on hand. Even if the kids have seen them 100 times, 
            they will enjoy them. After an hour or so, you will probably need a 
            break and the children might be cranky. A movie they are all 
            spellbound by will be a great way to relax the kids and you. You 
            might want to consider spreading a couple of blankets on the floor 
            and have some pillows handy for sleepyheads!<br>
            <br>

            color="#000000"> should have a big party, but remind them that this is because they are
            the big &quot;5,&quot; and either starting school or just in school, and having a
            &quot;big&quot; party will not happen every year. Explain to them that big parties are
            only for special birthdays such as 5 because they have started or are starting school, 10
            because that is the first double-digit number, and of course 16 (&quot;Sweet 16&quot; for
            girls and &quot;Driving Age&quot; for boys). This will save you money in the long run. On
            the fifth birthday, I suggest you first decide if you want to do it yourself, rent a
            building or park area but still do it yourself, or call local businesses (like McDonalds)
            to see what party-planning packages they offer. I personally suggest renting a park area
            if weather permits because the kids will be just as happy playing on park equipment as
            they would if you spent a ton of money on a professionally planned party. Have several
            inexpensive disposable cameras on hand and let your Birthday Boy or Girl take pictures of
            his or her first &quot;big&quot; party!<br>

            pins).<br>
            <br>
            You can also do face painting and movie time. As with the 4-year-olds, you<br>
            need to over plan for games and activities and a movie is a great back up (or a
            much-needed rest time). Another helpful hint is to take enough large plastic trash bags to
            cover your kitchen floor and lightly throw all colors of paint on them. Allow for adequate
            drying time before the party. Then you can use these bags to cover your kitchen floor
            before cake time to catch cake droppings and milk or soda spills (which WILL happen). <br>

            (even if they don't make it all night). If it is summer time, think about letting them
            sleep outside in a tent or on a screened-in porch (just be sure to let the parents know
            exactly where their children will be sleeping and you should plan to check in on them a
            few times during the night).<br>

            that age are very &quot;into&quot; who is popular and who is not. Don't push your child
            into inviting everyone you might think they should (because they might be afraid of being
            made fun of for having a party at home with their parents.) They know who to they can
            invite and who they can't without fear of peer pressure. My best suggestion for this age
            is either a pizza party at home or at a pizza parlor or a pool party, depending on the
            teenager's interest. </font></font></b></p>

            Before the party, blow up enough large-sized balloons so that there will be one per child.
            Do not blow up the balloons completely, leave them a little &#147;soft.&#148; When it is
            time to play the game, explain to the children that they are going to have a race to see
            who can pop their balloon first by just sitting on it. Make sure they understand that they
            can&#146;t bounce up and down on the balloon, or stand up all the way and sit down again,
            they just have to sit on it, and <i>sit hard</i>. You might even have the Birthday Boy or
            Girl demonstrate the rules. Then have the children sit on the floor and give each of them
            a balloon. When you say &#147;Go!&#148; have the children see who can pop their balloon
            first. The first one to pop the balloon wins a party prize.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

            likely to pop easily. You might want to blow up three times the number of children
            expected to attend (that is, if you invite 10 children, then blow up 30 balloons). Then
            hide the balloons (like you would Easter eggs). When it is time to play games, have the
            children hunt for the balloons (give them grocery bags to collect the balloons). The one
            who finds the most wins a party prize. You can also play the game by hiding small toys or
            party favors, or candy. If you hide candy, be sure to make notes for yourself about all
            the hiding places and check after the party to make sure all the candy has been
            &#147;found.&#148;</font></b></p>

            Blow bubbles and have the children try to catch them without bursting the bubbles. The
            first child to catch a bubble and return it to you without busting their bubble wins. You
            might want to have plenty of party favors so that each child can &#147;win&#148; at this

            Have the children break up into two equal groups. If you have an unequal number of
            children, have the Birthday Boy or Girl sit the game out. (For a young child, you might
            want to explain this to him/her before the party so that there won&#146;t be any tears
            during the party!) Set a starting line and turn-around point for the race. Give each group
            a balloon. Children are to carry the balloon between their knees down to the turn-around
            point and back to the starting line where the child passes the balloon to the next team
            member. The first team to finish wins. Game works best if balloons are not fully blown up.
            Have extra balloons on hand in case someone breaks the balloon. For very young children,
            you might change the game so that they are simply carrying the balloon, since short little
            legs might not be able to toddle along with a squishy balloon between their knees!&nbsp;</font></b></p>

            buttermilk to the butter mixture beating after each addition until 
            the batter is smooth. Fold in stiffly beaten egg whites and pour the 
            batter into 9 inch greased layer pans lined on the bottom with waxed 
            paper. Bake 35 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees. </font></span>
