<h1>Occupational Descriptions</h1>

<p>
The primary purpose of preparing job descriptions for the Bureau's
occupational pay surveys is to assist its field economists in
classifying into appropriate occupations workers who are employed
under a variety of payroll titles and different work arrangements
from establishment to establishment and from area to area. This
permits grouping of occupational wage rates representing comparable
job content. Because of this emphasis on comparability of occupational
content, the Bureau's job descriptions may differ significantly
from those in use in individual establishments or those prepared
for other purposes. In applying these job descriptions, the Bureau's
field economists are instructed to exclude working supervisors;
apprentices; learners, beginners, and trainees; and part-time,
temporary, and probationary workers, unless specifically included
in the job description. Handicapped workers whose pay are reduced
because of their handicap are also excluded.
</p>
<p>
The titles and numeric codes below the job titles in this appendix
are taken from the 1980 edition of the <cite>Standard Occupational
Classification Manual</cite> (SOC), issued by the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards.
</p>
<p>
In general, the occupational descriptions of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics are much more specific than those found in the SOC
manual. The BLS occupation, "Attorney," for example,
excludes workers engaged in patent work; the SOC occupation (code
211) includes patent lawyers.
</p>
<p>
Thus, in comparing the results of this survey with other sources,
factors such as differences in occupational definitions and survey
scope should be taken into consideration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Professional</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><a name="accountant">ACCOUNTANT</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
(1412: Accountant and auditor)
</p>
<p>
Performs professional operating or cost accounting work requiring
knowledge of the theory and practice of recording, classifying,
examining, and analyzing the data and records of financial transactions.
The work generally requires a bachelor's degree in accounting
or, in rare instances, equivalent experience and education combined.
Positions covered by this definition are characterized by the
inclusion of work that is analytical, creative, evaluative, and
advisory in nature. The work <cite>draws</cite> upon and <cite>requires
</cite>a thorough knowledge of the fundamental doctrines, theories,
principles, and terminology of accountancy, and often entails
some understanding of such related fields as business law, statistics,
and general management.
</p>
<p>
Professional responsibilities in accountant positions above levels
1 and 2 include several such duties as:
</p>
<p>
1. Analyzing the effects of transactions upon account relationships;
</p>
<p>
2. Evaluating alternative means of treating transactions;
</p>
<p>
3. Planning the manner in which account structures should be developed
or modified;
</p>
<p>
4. Assuring the adequacy of the accounting system as the basis
for reporting to management;
</p>
<p>
5. Considering the need for new or changed controls;
</p>
<p>
6. Projecting accounting data to show the effects of proposed
plans on capital investments, income, cash position, and overall
financial condition;
</p>
<p>
7. Interpreting the meaning of accounting records, reports, and
statements;
</p>
<p>
8. Advising operating officials on accounting matters; and
</p>
<p>
9. Recommending improvements, adaptations, or revisions in the
accounting system and procedures.
</p>
<p>
Accountant 1 and 2 positions provide opportunity to develop ability
to perform professional duties such as those enumerated above.
</p>
<p>
<cite>In addition</cite> to such professional work, most accountants
are also responsible for assuring the proper recording and documentation
of transactions in the accounts. They, therefore, frequently direct
nonprofessional personnel in the actual day-to-day maintenance
of books of accounts, the accumulation of cost or other comparable
data, the preparation of standard reports and statements, and
similar work. (Positions involving such supervisory work but not
including professional duties as described above are not included
in this description.)
</p>
<p>
Some accountants use electronic data processing equipment to process,
record, and report accounting data. In some such cases the machine
unit is a subordinate segment of the accounting system; in others
it is a separate entity or is attached to some other organization.
In either instance, provided that the primary responsibility of
the position is professional accounting work of the type otherwise
included, the use of data processing equipment of any type does
not of itself exclude a position from the accountant description
nor does it change its level.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Excluded</cite> are:
</p>
<p>
a. Top technical experts in accounting, for an organization, who
are <cite>responsible</cite> for the overall direction of an entire
accounting program which includes general accounting and at least
one other major accounting activity such as cost, property, sales,
or tax accounting;
</p>
<p>
b. Accountants above level 6 who are more concerned with administrative,
budgetary, and policy matters than the day-to-day supervision
of an operating accounting program; and
</p>
<p>
c. Accountants primarily responsible for 1) designing and improving
accounting systems or 2) performing nonoperating staff work such
as budget or financial analysis, financial analysis, or tax advising.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant 1</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. As an entry-level accountant,
learns to apply the principles, theories, and concepts of accounting
to a specific system. The position is distinguishable from nonprofessional
positions by the variety of assignments; rate and scope of development
expected; and the existence, implicit or explicit, of a planned
training program designed to give the entering accountant practical
experience. (Terminal positions are excluded.)
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. Works under close supervision of an
experienced accountant whose guidance is directed primarily to
the development of the trainee's professional ability and to the
evaluation of advancement potential. Limits of assignments are
clearly defined, methods of procedure are specified, and kinds
of items to be noted and referred to supervisor are identified.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. Performs a variety
of accounting tasks such as: examining a variety of financial
statements for completeness, internal accuracy, and conformance
with uniform accounting classifications or other specific accounting
requirements; reconciling reports and financial data with financial
statements already on file, and pointing out apparent inconsistencies
or errors; carrying out assigned steps in an accounting analysis,
such as computing standard ratios; assembling and summarizing
accounting literature on a given subject; preparing relatively
simple financial statements not involving problems of analysis
or presentation; and preparing charts, tables, and other exhibits
to be used in reports. In addition, may also perform some nonprofessional
tasks for training purposes.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Responsibility for the direction of others</cite>. Usually none.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant 2</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. At this level, the accountant
makes practical application of technical accounting practices
and concepts beyond the mere application of detailed rules and
instructions. Initial assignments are designed to expand practical
experience and to develop professional judgment in the application
of basic accounting techniques to simple problems. Is expected
to be competent in the application of standard procedures and
requirements to routine transactions, to raise questions about
unusual or questionable items, and to suggest solutions.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. Work is reviewed to verify general
accuracy and coverage of unusual problems, and to insure conformance
with required procedures and special instructions.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. Performs a variety
of accounting tasks, e.g., prepares routine working papers, schedules,
exhibits, and summaries indicating the extent of the examination
and presenting and supporting findings and recommendations. Examines
a variety of accounting documents to verify accuracy of computations
and to ascertain that all transactions are properly supported,
are in accordance with pertinent policies and procedures, and
are classified and recorded according to acceptable accounting
standards.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Responsibility for the direction of others</cite>. Usually none,
although sometimes responsible for supervision of a few clerks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant 3</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. The accountant at this level applies
well established accounting principles, theories, concepts, and
practices to moderately difficult problems. Receives detailed
instructions concerning the overall accounting system and its
objectives, the policies and procedures under which it is operated,
and the nature of changes in the system or its operation. Characteristically,
the accounting system or assigned segment is stable and well established
(i.e., the basic chart of accounts, classifications, the nature
of the cost accounting system, the report requirements, and the
procedures are changed infrequently).
</p>
<p>
Depending upon the work load involved, the accountant may have
such assignments as supervision of the <cite>day-to-day</cite> operation
of: (a) the entire system of a relatively small organization;
(b) a major segment (e.g., general accounting, cost accounting,
financial statements and reports) of a somewhat larger system;
or (c) in a complex system, may be assigned to a relatively narrow
and specialized segment dealing with some problem, function, or
portion of work which is appropriate for this level.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. A higher level professional accountant
normally is available to furnish advice and assistance as needed.
Work is reviewed for technical accuracy, adequacy of professional
judgment, and compliance with instructions through spot checks,
appraisal of results, subsequent processing, analysis of reports
and statements, and other appropriate means.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. The primary responsibility
of most positions at this level is to assure that the assigned
day-to-day operations are carried out in accordance with established
accounting principles, policies, and objectives. The accountant
performs such professional work as: developing nonstandard reports
and statements (e.g., those containing cash forecasts reflecting
the interrelations of accounting, cost budgeting, or comparable
information); interpreting and pointing out trends or deviations
from standards; projecting data into the future; predicting the
effects of changes in operating programs; or identifying management
informational needs, and refining account structures or reports
accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Within the limits of delegated responsibility, makes day-to-day
decisions concerning the accounting treatment of financial transactions.
In expected to recommend solutions to moderately difficult problems
and propose changes in the accounting system for approval at higher
levels. Such recommendations are derived from personal knowledge
of the application of well-established principles and practices.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Responsibility for the direction of others</cite>. In most instances
is responsible for supervision of a subordinate nonprofessional
staff; may coordinate the work of lower level professional accountants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant 4</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. Applies well-established accounting
principles, theories, concepts, and practices to a wide variety
of difficult problems. Receives instructions concerning the objectives
and operation of the overall accounting system. Compared with
level 3, the accounting system or assigned segment is more complex,
i.e., (a) is relatively unstable, (b) must adjust to new or changing
operational environments, (c) is substantially larger <cite>or</cite>(d)
is complicated by the need to provide and coordinate separate
or specialized accounting treatment and reporting (e.g., cost
accounting using standard cost, process cost, and job order techniques)
for different internal operations or divisions.
</p>
<p>
Depending upon the work load and degree of coordination involved,
the accountant 4 may have such assignments as the supervision
of the day-to-day operation of: (a) an entire accounting system
which has a few relatively stable accounting segments; (b) a major
segment (e.g., general accounting, cost accounting, or financial
statements and reports) of an accounting system serving a larger
and more complex organization; or (c) in a complex system, may
be assigned to a relatively narrow and specialized segment dealing
with some problem, function, or portion of work which is of the
level of difficulty characteristic of this level.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. A higher level accountant normally
is available to furnish advice and assistance as needed. Work
is reviewed by spot checks and appraisal of results for adequacy
of professional judgment, compliance with instructions, and overall
accuracy and quality.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. As at level 3, a primary
characteristic of most positions at this level is the responsibility
of operating an accounting system or major segment of a system
in the intended manner.
</p>
<p>
The accountant 4 exercises professional judgment in making frequent,
appropriate recommendations for: new accounts; revisions in the
account structure; new types of ledgers; revisions in the reporting
system or subsidiary records; changes in instructions regarding
the use of accounts, new or refined account classifications or
definitions; etc. Also makes day-to-day decisions concerning the
accounting treatment of financial transactions and is expected
to recommend solutions to complex problems beyond incumbent's
scope of responsibility.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Responsibility for the direction of others</cite>. Accounting
staff supervised, if any, may include professional accountants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant 5</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. Applies accounting principles,
theories, concepts, and practices to the solution of problems
for which no clear precedent exists or performs work which is
of greater than average responsibility due to the nature or magnitude
of the assigned work. Responsibilities at this level, in contrast
to accountants at level 4, extend beyond accounting system maintenance
to the solution of more complex technical and managerial problems.
Work of accountants 5 is more directly concerned with what the
accounting system (or segment) should be, what operating policies
and procedures should be established or revised, and what is the
managerial as well as the accounting meaning of the data included
in the reports and statements for which they are responsible.
</p>
<p>
Examples of assignments characteristic of this level are supervision
of the <cite>day-to-day operation</cite> of: (a) an entire accounting
system which has a few relatively complex accounting segments;
(b) a major segment of a larger and more complex accounting system;
(c) an entire accounting system (or major segment) that is relatively
stable and conventional when the work includes significant responsibility
for accounting system design and development; or (d) in a complex
system, may be assigned to a relatively narrow and specialized
segment dealing with some problem, function, or portion of work
which is itself of the level of difficulty characteristic of this
level.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. An accountant of higher level normally
is available to furnish advice and assistance as needed. Work
is reviewed for adequacy of professional judgment, compliance
with instructions, and overall quality.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. The accountant 5 performs
such professional work as: participating in the development and
coordinating the implementation of new or revised accounting systems,
and initiating necessary instructions and procedures; assuring
that accounting reporting systems and procedures are in compliance
with established administrative policies, regulations, and acceptable
accounting practices; providing technical advice and services
to operating managers, interpreting accounting reports and statements,
and identifying problem areas; and evaluating complete assignments
for conformance with applicable policies, regulations, and tax
laws.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Responsibility for the direction of others</cite>. Accounting
staff supervised generally includes professional accountants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant 6</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. At this level, the accountant
applies accounting principles, theories, concepts, and practices
to specialized, unique, or nonrecurring complex problems (e.g.,
implementation of specialized automated accounting systems). The
work is substantially more difficult and of greater responsibility
than level 5 because of the unusual nature, magnitude, importance,
or overall impact of the work on the accounting program.
</p>
<p>
At this level the accounting system or segment is usually complex,
i.e., (a) is generally unstable, (b) must adjust to the frequent
changing needs of the organization, or (c) is complicated by the
need to provide specialized or individualized reports.
</p>
<p>
Examples of assignments at this level are the supervision of the
day-to-day operation of: (a) a large and complex accounting system;
or (b) a major segment (e.g., general accounting, property accounting,
etc.) of an unusually complex accounting system requiring technical
expertise in a particular accounting field (e.g., cost accounting,
tax accounting, etc.).
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. A higher level professional accountant
is normally available to furnish advice as needed. Work is reviewed
for adequacy of professional judgment, compliance with instructions
and policies, and overall quality.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. Accountants at this
level are delegated complete responsibility from higher authority
to establish and implement new or revised accounting policies
and procedures. Typically, accountants 6 participate in decision-making
sessions with operating managers who have policy-making authority
for their subordinate organizations or establishments; recommend
management actions or alternatives which can be taken when accounting
data disclose unfavorable trends, situations, or deviations; and
assist management officials in applying financial data and information
to the solution of administrative and operating problems.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Responsibility for the direction of others</cite>. Accounting
staff supervised generally includes professional accountants.
</p>
<p>
Accountant not classifiable by level. Workers in positions with
work characteristics as described, and within the range of defined
levels, should be reported under this classification when the
information needed to classify them according to the level definitions
is not available.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a name="accountantpublic"></a>ACCOUNTANT, PUBLIC</strong><u> </u>
</p>
<p>
(1412: Accountant and auditor)
</p>
<p>
Performs professional auditing work in a public accounting firm.
Work requires at least a bachelor's degree in accounting. Participates
in or conducts audits to ascertain the fairness of financial representations
made by client companies. May also assist the client in improving
accounting procedures and operations.
</p>
<p>
Examines financial reports, accounting records, and related documents
and practices of clients. Determines whether all important matters
have been disclosed and whether procedures are consistent and
conform to acceptable practices. Samples and tests transactions,
internal controls, and other elements of the accounting system(s)
as needed to render the accounting firm's final written opinion.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Excluded</cite> are positions which do not require full professional
accounting training. Also excluded are specialist positions in
tax or management advisory services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant, Public 1</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. As an entry level public accountant,
serves as a junior member of an audit team. Receives classroom
and on-the-job training to provide practical experience in applying
the principles, theories, and concepts of accounting and auditing
to specific situations. (Positions held by trainee public accountants
with advanced degrees, such as MBA's are excluded at this level.)
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. Complete instructions are furnished
and work is reviewed to verify its accuracy, conformance with
required procedures and instructions, and usefulness in facilitating
the accountant's professional growth. Any technical problems not
covered by instructions are brought to the attention of a superior.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. Carries out basic
audit tests and procedures, such as: verifying reports against
source accounts and records; reconciling bank and other accounts;
and examining cash receipts and disbursements, payroll records,
requisitions, receiving reports, and other accounting documents
in detail to ascertain that transactions are properly supported
and recorded. Prepares selected portions of audit working papers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant, Public 2</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. At this level, the public accountant
carries out routine audit functions and detail work with relative
independence. Serves as a member of an audit team on assignments
planned to provide exposure to a variety of client organizations
and audit situations. Specific assignments depend upon the difficulty
and complexity of the audit and whether the client has been previously
audited by the firm. On moderately complex audits where there
is previous audit experience by the firm, accomplishes complete
segments of the audit (i.e., functional work areas such as cash,
receivables, etc.). When assigned to more complicated audits,
carries out activities similar to public accountant 1.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. Works under the supervision of a higher
level public accountant who provides instructions and continuing
direction as necessary. Work is spot checked in progress and reviewed
upon completion to determine the adequacy of procedures, soundness
of judgment, compliance with professional standards, and adherence
to clearly established methods and techniques. All interpretations
are subject to close professional review.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. Carries out a variety
of sampling and testing procedures in accordance with the prescribed
audit program, including the examination of transactions and verification
of accounts, the analysis and evaluation of accounting practices
and internal controls, and other detail work. Prepares a share
of the audit working papers and participates in drafting reports.
In moderately complex audits, may assist in selecting appropriate
tests, samples, and methods commonly applied by the firm and may
serve as primary assistant to the accountant in charge. In more
complicated audits concentrates on detail work. Occasionally may
be in charge of small, uncomplicated audits which require only
one or two other subordinate accountants. Personal contacts usually
involve only the exchange of factual technical information and
are usually limited to the client's operating accounting staff
and department heads.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant, Public 3</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. At this level the public accountant
is in charge of a complete audit and may lead a team of several
subordinates. Audits are usually accomplished one at a time and
are typically carried out at a single location. The firms audited
are typically moderately complex, and there is usually previous
audit experience by the firm. The audit conforms to standard procedural
guidelines, but is often tailored to fit the client's business
activities. Routine procedures and techniques are sometimes inadequate
and require adaptation. Necessary data are not always readily
available. When assigned to more difficult and complex audits
(see level 4), the accountant may run the audit of a major component
or serve as the primary assistant to the accountant in charge.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. Works under the general supervision
of a higher level public accountant who oversees the operation
of the audit. Work is performed independently, applying generally
accepted accounting principles and auditing standards, but assistance
on difficult technical matters is available. Work may be checked
occasionally during progress for appropriateness and adherence
to time requirements, but routine analyses, methods, techniques,
and procedures applied at the work site are expected to be correct.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. Is responsible for
carrying out the technical features of the audit, leading team
members and personally performing the most difficult work. Carries
out field work in accordance with the general format prescribed
in the audit program, but selects specific methods and types and
sizes of samples and tests. Assigns work to team members, furnishes
guidance, and adjusts work loads to accommodate daily priorities.
Thoroughly reviews work performed for technical accuracy and adequacy.
Resolves anticipated problems with established guidelines and
priorities but refers problems of unusual difficulty to superiors
for discussion and advice. Drafts financial statements, final
reports, management letters, and other closing memoranda. Discusses
significant recommendations with superiors and may serve as technical
resource at "closing" meetings with clients. Personal
contacts are usually with accounting directors and assistant controllers
of medium size companies and divisions of large corporations to
explain and interpret policies and procedures governing the audit
process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Accountant, Public 4</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>General characteristics</cite>. At this level, the public accountant
directs field work including difficult audits&mdash;e.g., those involving
initial audits of new clients, acquisitions, or stock registration&mdash;and
may oversee a large audit team split between several locations.
The audit team usually includes one or more level 3 public accountants
who handle major components of the audit. The audits are complex
and
</p>
<p>
clients typically include those engaged in projects which span
accounting periods; highly regulated industries which have various
external reporting requirements; publicly held corporations; or
businesses with very high dollar or transaction volume. Clients
are frequently large with a variety of operations which may have
different accounting systems. Guidelines may be general or lacking
and audit programs are intricate, often requiring extensive tailoring
to meet atypical or novel situations.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Direction received</cite>. Works under general supervision. The
supervisor sets overall objectives and resource limits but relies
on the accountant to fully plan and direct all technical phases
of the audit. Issues not covered by guidelines or known precedents
are discussed with the supervisor, but the accountant's recommended
approaches and courses of action are normally approved. Work is
reviewed for soundness of approach, completeness, and conformance
with established policies of the firm.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties and responsibilities</cite>. Is responsible for
carrying out the operational and technical features of the audit,
directing the work of team members, and personally performing
the most difficult work. Often participates in the development
of the audit scope, and drafts complicated audit programs with
a large number of concurrently executed phases. Independently
develops audit steps and detailed procedures, deviating from traditional
methods to the extent required. Makes program adjustments as necessary
once an audit has begun; selects specific methods, types and sizes
of samples, the extent to which discrepancies need to be investigated,
and the depth of required analyses. Resolves most operational
difficulties and unanticipated problems.
</p>
<p>
Assigns work to team members; reviews work for appropriateness,
conformance to time requirements, and adherence to generally accepted
accounting principles and auditing standards. Consolidates working
papers, draft reports, and findings; and prepares financial statements,
management letters, and other closing memoranda for management
approval. Participates in "closing" meetings as a technical
resource and may be called upon to sell or defend controversial
and critical observations and recommendations. Personal contacts
are extensive and typically include top executives of smaller
clients and mid- to upper-level financial and management officers
of large corporations, e.g., assistant controllers and controllers.
Such contacts involve coordinating and advising on work efforts
and resolving operating problems.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Note:</cite> <cite>Excluded</cite> from this level are public accountants
who direct field work associated with the complete range of audits
undertaken by the firm, lead the largest and most difficult audits,
and who frequently oversee teams performing concurrent audits.
This type of work requires extensive knowledge of one or more
industries to make subjective determinations on questions of tax,
law, accounting, and business practices. Audits may be complicated
by such factors as: the size and diversity of the client organizations
(e.g., multinational corporations and conglomerates with a large
number of separate and distinct subsidiaries); accounting issues
where precedents are lacking or in conflict; and, in some cases,
clients who are encountering substantial financial difficulties.
They perform most work without technical supervision and completed
audits are reviewed mainly for propriety of recommendations and
conformance with general policies of the firm. Also excluded are
public accountants whose principal function is to manage, rather
than perform accounting work, and the equity owners of the firm
who have final approval authority.

<p>
<cite>Difficulty</cite>
</p>
<p>
<strong>D-1</strong>
</p>
<p>
Legal questions are characterized by: facts that are well-established;
clearly applicable legal precedents; <cite>and</cite> matters not of
substantial importance to the organization. (Usually relatively
limited sums of money, e.g., a few thousand dollars, are involved.)
</p>
<p>
<cite>Examples of D-1 work are:</cite>
</p>
<p>
a. legal investigation, negotiation, and research preparatory
to defending the organization in potential or actual lawsuits
involving alleged negligence where the facts can be firmly established
and there are precedent cases directly applicable to the situation;
</p>
<p>
b. searching case reports, legal documents, periodicals, textbooks,

factual issues are relatively straight forward and the impact
of the case is limited; and
</p>
<p>
e. advising public defendants in regard to routine criminal charges
or complaints and representing such defendants in court when legal
alternatives and facts are relatively clear and the impact of
the outcome is limited primarily to the defendant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>D-2</strong>
</p>
<p>
Legal work is regularly difficult by reason of one or more of
the following: the absence of clear and directly applicable legal
precedents; the different possible interpretations that can be
placed on the facts, the laws, or the precedents involved; the
substantial importance of the legal matters to the organization
(e.g., sums as large as $100,000 are generally directly or indirectly
involved); or the matter is being strongly pressed or contested
in formal proceedings or in negotiations by the individuals, corporations,
or government agencies involved.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Examples of D-2 work are:</cite>
</p>
<p>
a. advising on the legal implications of advertising representations
when the facts supporting the representations and the applicable
precedent cases are subject to different interpretations;
</p>
<p>
b. reviewing and advising on the implications of new or revised
laws affecting the organization;
</p>
<p>
c. presenting the organization's defense in court in a negligence
lawsuit which is strongly pressed by counsel for an organized
group;
</p>
<p>
d. providing legal counsel on tax questions complicated by the
absence of precedent decisions that are directly applicable to
the organization's situation;
</p>
<p>
e. preparing and prosecuting criminal cases when the facts of
the cases are complex or difficult to determine or the outcome
will have a significant impact within the jurisdiction; and
</p>
<p>
f. advising and representing public defendants in all phases of
criminal proceedings when the facts of the case are complex or
difficult to determine, complex or unsettled legal issues are
involved, or the prosecutorial jurisdiction devotes substantial
resources to obtaining a conviction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>D-3</strong>
</p>
<p>
Legal work is typically complex and difficult because of one or
more of the following: the questions are unique and require a
high order of original and creative legal endeavor for their solution;
the questions require extensive research and analysis and the
obtaining and evaluation of expert testimony regarding controversial
issues in a scientific, financial, corporate organization, engineering,
or other highly technical area; the legal matter is of critical
importance to the organization and is being vigorously pressed
or contested (e.g., sums such as $1 million or more are generally
directly or indirectly involved.)
</p>
<p>
<cite>Examples of D-3 work are:</cite>
</p>
<p>
a. advising on the legal aspects and implications of Federal antitrust
laws to projected greatly expanded marketing operations involving
joint ventures with several other organizations;
</p>
<p>
b. planning legal strategy and representing a utility company
in rate or government franchise cases involving a geographic area
including parts or all of several States;
</p>
<p>
c. preparing and presenting a case before an appellate court where
the case is highly important to the future operation of the organization
and is vigorously contested by very distinguished (e.g., having
a broad regional or national reputation) legal talent;
</p>
<p>
d. serving as the principal counsel to the officers and staff
of an insurance company on the legal problems in the sale, underwriting,
and administration of group contracts involving nationwide or
multi-state coverages and laws;
</p>
<p>
e. performing the principal legal work in nonroutine, major revision
of a company's charter or in effectuating new major financing
steps; and
</p>
<p>
f. serving as lead prosecutor in major felony trials, when legal
issues involve balancing conflicting laws or principles or factual
issues require extensive research and expert testimony in highly
technical subjects or the case is vigorously contested for the
defendant by very distinguished legal talent.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Responsibility</cite>
</p>
<p>
<strong>R-1</strong>

covered by legal precedents and in which little deviation from
standard practice is involved. Any decisions or actions having
a significant bearing on the organization's business are reviewed.
Is given guidance in the initial states of assignment, e.g., in
planning and organizing level research and studies. Assignments
are then carried out with moderate independence, although guidance
is generally available and is sought from time to time on problem
points.
</p>
<p>
<strong>R-2</strong>
</p>
<p>
Usually works independently in investigating the facts, searching
legal precedents, defining the legal and factual issues, drafting
the necessary legal documents, and developing conclusions and
recommendations. Decisions having an important bearing on the
organization's business are reviewed. Receives information from
supervisor regarding unusual circumstances or important policy
considerations pertaining to a legal problem. If trials are involved,
may receive guidance from a supervisor regarding presentation,
line of approach, possible line of opposition to be encountered,
etc. In the case of nonroutine written presentations, the final
product is reviewed carefully, but primarily for overall soundness
of legal reasoning and consistency with organization policy. May
assign work to lower level attorneys, aides, or clerks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>R-3</strong>
</p>
<p>
Carries out assignments independently and makes final legal determination
in matters of substantial importance to the organization. Such
determinations are subject to review only for consistency with
organization policy, possible precedent effect, and overall effectiveness.
To carry out assignments, deals regularly with officers of the
organization and top level management officials and confers or
negotiates regularly with senior attorneys and officials in other
organizations on various aspects of assigned work. Receives little
or no preliminary instruction on legal problems and a minimum
of technical legal supervision. May assign and review work of
a few attorneys, but this is not a primary responsibility.
</p>
<p>
<strong>R-4</strong>
</p>
<p>
Carries out assignments which entail independently planning investigations
and negotiations on legal problems of the highest importance to
the organization and developing completed brief, opinions, contracts,
or other legal products. To carry out assignments, represents
the organization at conferences, hearings, or trials, and personally
confers and negotiates with top attorneys and top-ranking officials
in other organizations. On various aspects of assigned work, may
give advice directly and personally to organization officials
and top level managers, or (in extremely large and complex organizations)
may work through a higher level attorney in advising officials.
Generally receives no preliminary instructions on legal problems.
On matters requiring the concentrated efforts of several attorneys
or other specialists, is responsible for directing, coordinating,
and reviewing the work of the attorneys involved.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Buyer/Contracting Specialist 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
Purchases "off-the-shelf" types of readily available,
commonly used materials, supplies, tools, furniture, services,
etc.
</p>
<p>
Transactions usually involve local retailers, wholesalers, jobbers,
and manufacturers' sales representatives.
</p>
<p>
Quantities purchased are generally small amounts, e.g., those
available from local sources.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Examples</cite> of items purchased include: common stationery
and office supplies; standard types of office furniture and fixtures;
standard nuts, bolts, screws; janitorial and common building maintenance
supplies; or common utility services or office machine repair
services.
</p>
<p>
<cite>OR</cite>
</p>
<p>
As a trainee, performs various clearly defined procurement tasks
designed to increase the employee's knowledge and understanding
of procurement and contracting concepts, principles, practices,
and procedures. Examples of duties include: assisting in the preparation
of solicitation documents; analyzing prices, discounts, and delivery
dates; making procurement recommendations; and drafting simple
contract provisions and supporting documentation. Work is performed
under close supervision.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Buyer/Contracting Specialist 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
Purchases "off-the-shelf" types of standard, generally
available technical items, materials, and services. Transactions
may involve occasional modification of standard and common usage
items, materials, and services, and include a few stipulations
about unusual packing, marking, shipping, etc.
</p>
<p>
Transactions usually involve dealing directly with manufacturers,
distributors, jobbers, etc. Limited contract negotiation techniques
may be used, primarily for developmental purposes to increase
employee's skill and knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Quantities of items and materials purchased may be relatively
large, particularly in the case of contracts for continuing supply
over a period of time.
</p>
<p>
May be responsible for locating or promoting possible new sources
of supply. Usually is expected to keep abreast of market trends,
changes in business practices in the assigned markets, new or
altered types of materials entering the market, etc.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Examples</cite> of items purchased <cite>or under contract include
</cite>: standard industrial types of hand tools, gloves, and safety
equipment; standard electronic parts, components, and component
test instruments; electric motors; gasoline service station equipment;
PBX or other specialized telephone services; special purpose printing
services; custodial services for a large building; and routine
purchases of common raw materials such as standard grades and
sizes of steel bars, rods, and angles.
</p>
<p>
Also included at this level are buyers of materials of the types
described for Buyer 1 when the quantities purchased are large,
so that local sources of supply are generally inadequate and the
buyer must deal directly with manufacturers on a broader than
local scale.
</p>
<p>
<cite>OR</cite>
</p>
<p>
In a developmental position, assists higher level buyers or contracting
specialists in purchasing, and/or negotiating contracts for items,
materials, or services of a technical and specialized nature.
Assigned work is designed to provide diversified experience, as
a background for future higher level work. Examples of duties
include: reviewing requisitions and drafting solicitations; evaluating
bids and the dependability of suppliers; meeting with commercial
representatives; and monitoring the progress of contractors. Supervisor
provides general instructions, monitors work, and reviews recommendations.
Standard or routine aspects of work are performed with greater
independence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Buyer/Contracting Specialist 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
Purchases items, materials, or services of a technical and specialized
nature, usually by negotiating a standard contract based on reimbursement
of costs and expenses or a fixed price ceiling. May be responsible
for overseeing the post award (contract administration) functions
(e.g., monitoring contract compliance, recommending action on
problem situations, and negotiating extensions of delivery schedules)
of such contracts. The items, while of a common general type,
are usually made, altered, or customized to meet the user's specific
needs and specifications.
</p>
<p>
The number of potential vendors is likely to be small and price
differentials often reflect important factors (quality, delivery
dates and places, etc.) that are difficult to evaluate.
</p>
<p>
The quantities purchased of any item or service may be large.
</p>
<p>
Many of the purchases involve one or more such complications as:
specifications that detail, in technical terms, the required physical,
chemical, electrical, or other comparable properties; special
testing prior to acceptance; grouping of items for lot bidding
and awards; specialized processing, packing, or packaging requirements;
export packs; overseas port differentials; etc.
</p>
<p>
Is expected to keep abreast of market and product developments.
May be required to locate new sources of supply.
</p>
<p>
Some positions may involve <cite>assisting</cite> in the training or
supervision of lower level buyers or clerks.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Examples</cite> of items purchased include: castings; special
extruded shapes of normal size and material; special formula paints;
electric motors of special shape or speeds; production equipment;
special packaging of items; raw materials in substantial quantities
or with special characteristics; and protective services where
security presents an especially significant problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Buyer/Contracting Specialist 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
Negotiates and/or administers purchase contracts for complex and
highly technical items, materials, or services, frequently specially
designed and manufactured exclusively for the purchaser.
</p>
<p>
Transactions require dealing with manufacturers and often involve
persuading potential vendors to undertake the manufacture of custom
designed items according to complex and rigid specifications.
Negotiation techniques are also frequently involved with convincing
the vendor to reduce costs.
</p>
<p>
Quantities of items and materials purchased are often large in
order to satisfy the requirements for an entire large organization
for an extended period of time. Complex schedules of delivery
are often involved. Contracting specialists determine appropriate
quantities to be contracted for at any given period of time and
negotiate with vendors to establish or adjust delivery schedules.
</p>
<p>
Negotiations and contract administration are often complicated
by the following: requirements for spare parts, preproduction
samples and testing, or technical literature; patent and royalty
provisions; or renegotiation of contract terms. In reviewing contract
proposals, extensive cost analysis is required to evaluate the
cost of such factors as 1) numerous technical specifications,
and 2) potential changes in manufacturing processes that might
affect projected cost figures. These complications result in the
incorporation of numerous special provisions and incentives in
renegotiated contracts.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the work described above, a few positions may also
require supervision of a few lower level buyers, contracting specialists
or clerks. (No position is included in this level solely because
supervisory duties are performed.)
</p>
<p>
<cite>Examples</cite> of items purchased include: special purpose high-cost
machine tools and production facilities; specialized condensers,
boilers, and turbines; raw materials of critically important characteristics
or quality; and parts, subassemblies, components, etc., specially
designed and made to order (e.g., communications equipment for
installation in aircraft being manufactured; component assemblies
for missiles and rockets; and motor vehicle frames).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Buyer/Contracting Specialist 5</strong>
</p>
<p>
Performs one of the following:
</p>
<p>
1. Serves as lead negotiator or contract administrator for: new
or unique equipment; extensive technical or professional services;
or complex construction projects where there is a lack of previous
experience or competition, extensive subcontracting, or similar
complications. Examples of contracts include prototype development
of sophisticated research and testing equipment, software systems
development, scientific studies involving waste and transportation
systems, facilities for production of weapons systems, and research
laboratories requiring special equipment.
</p>
<p>
2. Performs large-scale centralized purchasing or contract administration
for a multi-unit organization or large establishment that requires
either items with unique requirements as to construction, testing,
durability, or quality characteristics, or organization-wide services.
Examples of contracts include organization-wide software or communication
systems, and industry-specific testing equipment with unique specifications.
</p>
<p>
May persuade suppliers to expand their plants or convert facilities
to the production of new items or services.
</p>
<p>
Transactions are often complicated by technological changes, urgent
needs to override normal production, great volume of production,
commodity shortages, and lack of competition among vendors. Frequent
technological changes require delays or modifications to contract
proposals or to existing contracts. In-depth cost analysis is
required, often with little pricing precedent due to the unique
aspects of the products.
</p>
<p>
Contracts are usually long-term (exceeding 2 years) and involve
numerous subcontracts and special provisions that must be changed
and renegotiated throughout the duration of the contract.
</p>

<p>
<strong><a name="analystmgr"></a>COMPUTER SYSTEMS ANALYST SUPERVISOR/MANAGER
</strong>
</p>
<p>
(1712: Computer systems analyst)
</p>
<p>
Supervises three or more employees, two of whom perform systems
analysis. Work requires substantial and recurring use of systems
analysis skills in directing staff. May also supervise programmers
and related clerical and technical support personnel.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Excluded</cite> are:
</p>
<p>
a. Positions also having significant responsibility for the management
or supervision of functional areas (e.g., system software development,
data entry, or computer operations) <cite>not</cite> related to the
Computer Systems Analyst and Computer Programmer definitions;
</p>
<p>
b. Supervisory positions having base levels below Computer Systems
Analyst 2 or Computer Programmer 4; and
</p>
<p>
c. Managers who supervise two or more subordinates performing
at Computer Systems Analyst Supervisor/Manager level 4.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Classification by level</strong>
</p>
<p>
Supervisory jobs are matched at one of four levels according to
two factors: a) base level of work supervised; and b) level of
supervision. The table following the explanations of these factors
indicates the level of the supervisor for each combination of
factors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Base level of work</strong>
</p>
<p>
The base level of work is the highest level of<cite> nonsupervisory
</cite>work under the direct or indirect supervision of the supervisor/manager
which (when added to the nonsupervisory levels above it) represents
at least 25 percent of the total nonsupervisory, nonclerical staff
and at least two of the full-time positions supervised.
</p>
<p>
To determine the base level of nonsupervisory, nonclerical work:
1) array the positions by level of difficulty; 2) determine the
number of workers in each position; and 3) count down from the
highest level (if necessary) until at least 25 percent of the
total nonsupervisory, nonclerical staff are represented.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level of supervision</strong>
</p>
<p>
Supervisors and managers should be matched at one of the three
LS levels below which best describes their supervisory responsibility.
</p>
<p>
LS-1 Plans, coordinates, and evaluates the work of a small staff,
normally not more than 15 programmers, systems analysts, and technicians;
estimates personnel needs and schedules, assigns, and reviews
work to meet completion date; interviews candidates for own unit
and recommends hires, promotions, or reassignments; resolves complaints
and refers group grievances and more serious unresolved complaints
to higher level supervisors; may reprimand employees.
</p>
<p>
LS-2 Directs a sizable staff (normally 15-30 employees), typically
divided into sub-units controlled by subordinate supervisors;
advises higher level management on work problems of own unit and
the impact on broader programs; collaborates with heads of other
units to negotiate and/or coordinate work changes; makes decisions
on work or training problems presented by subordinate supervisors;
evaluates subordinate supervisors and reviews their evaluations
of other employees; selects nonsupervisors (higher level approval
is virtually assured) and recommends supervisory selections; hears
group grievances and serious or unresolved complaints. May shift
resources among projects and perform long range budget planning.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Note: </cite>In <cite>rare instances</cite>, supervisory positions responsible
for directing a sizable staff (e.g., 20-30 employees) may not
have subordinate supervisors, but <cite>have all other LS-2 responsibilities
</cite>. Such positions should be matched to LS-2.
</p>
<p>
LS-3 Directs two subordinate supervisory levels and the work force
managed typically includes substantially more than 30 employees.
Makes major decisions and recommendations (listed below) which
have a direct, important, and substantial effect on own organization
and work. Performs <cite>at least three</cite> of the following:
</p>
<p>
decides what programs and projects should be initiated, dropped,
expanded, or curtailed;
</p>
<p>
determines long range plans in response to program changes, evaluates
program goals, and redefines objectives;
</p>
<p>
determines changes to be made in organizational structure, delegation
of authority, coordination of units, etc.;
</p>
<p>
decides what compromises to make in operations in view of public
relations implications and need for support from various groups;
</p>
<p>
decides on the means to substantially reduce operating costs without
impairing overall operations; justifies major equipment expenditures;
and
</p>
<p>
resolves differences between key subordinate officials; decides,
or significantly affects final decisions, on personnel actions
for supervisors and other key officials.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a name="personnel"></a>PERSONNEL SPECIALIST</strong>
</p>
<p>
(143: Personnel, training, and labor relations specialist)
</p>
<p>
Plans, administers, advises on, or performs professional work
in <cite>one or more</cite> personnel specialties, such as:

administering equal opportunity provisions.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Labor Relations</cite>: Advising and assisting management on a
variety of labor relations matters, and negotiating and administering
labor agreements on behalf of management.
</p>
<p>
<cite>In addition to</cite> the technical responsibilities described
in levels 1 through 6, personnel specialists may also <cite>manage
personnel functions</cite> and supervise subordinate staff. At levels
1 and 2, the subordinate staff typically consists of clerks and
paraprofessionals; level 3 may coordinate the work of lower level
specialists; and levels 4 and above may supervise subordinate
specialists. Positions which are <cite>primarily supervisory</cite>,
rather than technical, in nature (i.e., they are not readily matchable
to the level-to-level distinctions in this definition) should
be matched to the personnel supervisor/manager definition.
</p>
<p>
This broad, generic occupation includes specialists: (1) working
in personnel <cite>operations</cite>; (2) reviewing and evaluating the
quality of personnel programs; and (3) developing and revising
personnel programs and procedures.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Excluded</cite> are:
</p>
<p>
a. Positions matched to the personnel supervisor/manager definition;
</p>
<p>
b. Directors of personnel, who service more than 250 employees
and have significant responsibility for administering all three
of the following functions: Job evaluation, employment and placement,
and employee relations and services. In addition, workers in these
excluded positions serve top management of their organization
as <cite>the</cite> source of advice on personnel matters and problems;
</p>
<p>
c. Clerical and paraprofessional positions;
</p>
<p>
d. Labor relations specialists who negotiate with labor unions
as the <cite>principal</cite> representative of their <cite>overall</cite>organization;
</p>
<p>
e. Specialists with matchable titles (e.g., labor relations specialist,

establishment's personnel program;
</p>
<p>
f. Specialists in other occupations (e.g., nursing, organizational
development, payroll, safety and health, security, and training),
<cite>even if</cite> these positions are part of the establishment's
personnel program;
</p>
<p>
g. Positions not requiring: (1) three years of administrative,
technical, or substantive clerical experience; (2) a bachelor's
degree in any field; or (3) any equivalent combination of experience
and education yielding basic skills in problem analysis and communication;
and
</p>
<p>
h. Positions employed by personnel supply service establishments
(S.I.C. 736).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Classification by level</strong>
</p>
<p>
Establishment positions which meet the above criteria are matched
at one of six levels. <cite>Primary leveling concepts</cite> are presented
for each of the three options: (1) operations, (2) program evaluation,
and (3) program development. These leveling <cite>concepts take precedent
over typical duties and responsibilities</cite> in determining the
level of a match. Job duties that are "moderately complex"
in one establishment may be "procedural" in another
establishment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personnel Specialist 1 (operations only)</strong> 
</p>
<p>
As a trainee, receives classroom and/or on-the-job training in
the principles, procedures, and regulations of the personnel program
and in the programs, policies, and objectives of the employing
organization. Assignments provide experience in applying personnel
management principles, procedures and techniques, while performing
a variety of uncomplicated tasks under close supervision.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personnel Specialist 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
<cite>Operations</cite>. Performs <cite>standard</cite> <cite>procedural duties
</cite>which require the use of personnel management principles and
techniques to identify and analyze personnel problems. Provides
limited advice to management, such as informing departmental supervisors
of typical duty patterns which comprise an occupational level
or of types of candidates available for a particular type of job.
Receives specific instructions with each new assignment.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program evaluation and development</cite>. Assists higher level
specialists in preliminary phases of evaluation or development.
Receives increasingly difficult assignments under close supervisory
guidance and review.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties include</cite>: analyzing and evaluating nonexempt
jobs using standard procedures; participating in recruitment or
compensation surveys for nonexempt jobs; rating applicants using
established guides; explaining established policies, procedures,
or regulations to employees or management; and performing limited
tasks to assist higher level specialists in employee development,
employee relations, and labor relations programs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personnel Specialist 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
<cite>Operations</cite>. Performs moderately complex assignments following
established policies and guidelines. Work requires experience
both in a personnel specialty and in the organization serviced.
Advises management on the solution to personnel problems of limited
scope for which there are precedents. Renders advice concerning
own specialty, but discusses impact on other personnel areas.
Works independently under specified objectives; closer supervision
is provided for complex assignments, precedent-setting actions,
and actions that impact either other functional areas or key working
relationships.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program evaluation and development</cite>. Assists higher level
specialists or managers by studying less complex aspects of personnel
programs (e.g., merit promotions, incentive awards), resolving
problems of average difficulty, and reporting findings to be included
in evaluation reports.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties include</cite>: analyzing, evaluating, and defining
both exempt and nonexempt jobs in various occupational groups
using established procedures; participating in surveys of broad
compensation areas; recruiting and screening applicants for both
exempt and nonexempt jobs, checking references and recommending
placement; assisting in identifying training needs and arranging
training, initiating personnel actions or awards, and interpreting
established personnel policy, regulations, and precedents; or
participating in preparing for and conducting labor negotiations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personnel Specialist 4</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<cite>Operations</cite>. Applies to three different work situations.
In situation (1), specialists use technical knowledge, skills,
and judgment to solve complex technical problems. Advisory services
to management are similar to those described at level 3. Situation
(2) combines typical level 3 operating skills with comprehensive
management advisory services. Advisory services require high technical
skills, along with broad personnel knowledge, to solve problems
from a total personnel management perspective. In situations (1)
and (2), specialists plan and complete work following established
program goals and objectives. Their judgments and recommendations
are relied on for management decisions.
</p>
<p>
Situation (3) applies to specialists who are <cite>solely</cite> responsible
for performing moderately complex assignments (as described in
level 3) and for rendering <cite>final decisions</cite> on assigned
personnel matters under general administrative supervision. Responsibilities
include planning and scheduling work and coordinating and integrating
program(s) with other personnel, management, and operational activities.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program evaluation</cite>. Conducts on-site review of personnel
actions in several organizational units; determines factual basis
for personnel actions, evaluates actions for consistency with
established guidelines, and reports significant findings.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program development</cite>. Independently develops supplemental
guidelines for existing procedures.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties include</cite>: analyzing, evaluating, and defining
difficult exempt jobs, i.e., those in research and development,
administration, law, and computer science; planning and conducting
broad compensation surveys and recommending pay and benefit adjustments;
developing training plans and procedures for an organizational
segment; participating in complex employee-management relations
issues such as controversies, poor morale, and high turnover;
or developing plans and procedures for labor negotiations in a
moderately complex organization.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personnel Specialist 5</strong>
</p>
<p>
<cite>Operations</cite>. Applies to two different work situations. In
situation (1), specialists solve unusually complex and unprecedented
problems which require creative solutions. In situation (2), specialists
are assigned complex technical problems (as described in level
4 - situation (1) combined with responsibility for providing comprehensive
advice to management. Management advisory services are complicated
by jobs and organizations that are complex, new, or dynamic, and
by the abstract nature of the work processes. Supervision and
guidance relate largely to program goals and time schedules. Specialists
are authorized to make decisions for their organizations and consult
with their supervisors concerning unusual problems and developments.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program evaluation</cite>. Independently evaluates personnel programs
to determine the degree to which they are achieving goals and
objectives, ascertaining weaknesses in programs and guidelines,
and making recommendations for improvements. Conclusions are reported
to top management.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program development</cite>. Applies expertise in modifying procedures
and guidelines. Projects are usually narrow in scope, i.e., limited
to an occupational field or to a specific program area. May have
full technical responsibility for personnel projects, studies,
policies, or programs that are less complex than described at
level 6.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Typical duties include</cite>: Participating in the development
of personnel policies and procedures; analyzing, evaluating, and
defining unusually difficult jobs, e.g., those in emerging occupations
which lack applicable guidelines, or in organizations so complex
and dynamic that it is difficult to determine the extent of a
position's responsibility; recruiting candidates for one-of-a-kind
jobs; participating in employee-management relations where the
underlying issues are difficult to identify; planning and administering
a comprehensive employee development program; or performing labor
relations assignments for a large conglomerate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personnel Specialist 6</strong>
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program evaluation</cite>. Applies to three different work situations.
In situation (1), specialists evaluate the personnel management
program of large, complex organizations. Such evaluations require
broad understanding and sensitivity both to the interrelationships
between different personnel programs and to complex organizational
and management relationships. In situation (2), specialists provide
advice to management in improving personnel programs in unusually
complex organizations. Such expertise extends beyond knowledge
of guidelines, precedents, and technical principles into areas
of program management and administration. In situation (3), specialists
serve as evaluation experts assigned to uniquely difficult and
sensitive personnel problems, e.g., solutions are unusually controversial;
specialists are required to persuade and motivate key officials
to change major personnel policies or procedures; or problems
include serious complaints where facts are vague.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Program development</cite>. Specialists have full technical responsibility
for unusually complex personnel projects, studies, policies, or
programs. The scope and impact of these assignments are broad
and are of considerable importance to organizational management.
</p>
<p>
Supervision received is essentially administrative, with assignments
given in terms of broad general objectives and limits.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a name="personnelmgr"></a>PERSONNEL SUPERVISOR/MANAGER</strong>
</p>
<p>
(143: Personnel, training, and labor relations specialist)
</p>
<p>
Supervises three or more personnel specialists and/or clerks and
paraprofessionals. Although the work is supervisory in nature,
it requires substantial knowledge of personnel policies, procedures,
and practices.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Excluded</cite> are:
</p>
<p>
a. Positions matched to the personnel specialist definition:
</p>
<p>
b. Directors of personnel, who service more than 250 employees
and have significant responsibility for administering all three
of the following functions: Job evaluation, employment and placement,
and employee relations and services. In addition, workers in these
excluded positions serve top management of their organization
as <cite>the</cite> source of advice on personnel matters and problems;
</p>
<p>
c. Labor relations positions which are primarily responsible for
negotiating with labor unions as the principal representative
of their <cite>overall</cite> organization;
</p>
<p>
d. Supervisory positions having both a base level below personnel
specialist 3 <cite>and</cite> requiring technical expertise <cite>below
</cite>personnel specialist 4; and
</p>
<p>
e. Positions also having significant responsibility for functional
areas beyond personnel (e.g., payroll, purchasing, or administration).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Classification by Level</strong>
</p>
<p>
Supervisory jobs are matched at one of five levels according to
two factors: a) base level of work supervised, and b) level of
supervision. The table following the explanations of these factors
indicates the level of the supervisor for each combination of
factors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Base Level of Work</strong>
</p>
<p>
Conceptually, the base level of work is the highest level of 
<cite>nonsupervisory</cite> work under the direct or indirect supervision
of the supervisor/manager which (when added to the nonsupervisory
levels above it) represents at least 25 percent of the total nonsupervisory,
nonclerical staff and at least <cite>two</cite> of the full-time positions
supervised.
</p>
<p>
To determine the base level of nonsupervisory, nonclerical work:
1) array the
</p>
<p>
positions by level of difficulty; 2) determine the number of workers
in each position; and 3) count down from the highest level (if
necessary) until at least 25 percent of the total nonsupervisory,
nonclerical staff are represented.
</p>
<p>
Establishment supervisory positions matched in the personnel specialist
series should be counted as "non-supervisory" in computing
the base level for personnel supervisor/manager matches.
</p>
<p>
Due to the unique nature of this particular occupation series,
the mechanics of the base level concept are often not applicable
in determining the appropriate job level of a personnel supervisor/manager.
See Alternative Criteria For Matching Personnel Supervisors/Managers
at the end of this definition for assistance in assuring correct
job matches.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level of Supervision</strong>
</p>
<p>
Supervisors and managers should be matched at one of the three
LS levels below which best describes their supervisory responsibility.
</p>
<p>
LS-1 Plans, coordinates, and evaluates the work of a small staff,
normally not more than 10 personnel specialists, paraprofessionals,
and clerks; estimates staffing needs for personnel unit and schedules,
assigns, and reviews work to meet completion date; interviews
candidates for own unit and recommends hires, promotions, or reassignments;
and resolves complaints, referring group grievances and more serious
unresolved complaints to higher level supervisors; may reprimand
employees.
</p>
<p>
LS-2 Directs a sizable staff (normally 10-20 employees), typically
divided into sub-units controlled by subordinate supervisors;
advises higher level management on work problems of own unit and
the impact on broader programs; collaborates with heads of other
units to negotiate and/or coordinate work changes; makes decisions
on work or training problems presented by subordinate supervisors;
evaluates subordinate supervisors and reviews their evaluations
of their employees; selects nonsupervisors (higher level approval
is virtually assured) and recommends supervisory selections; and
hears group grievances and serious or unresolved complaints. May
shift resources among projects and perform long range budget planning.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Note:</cite> In <cite>rare instances</cite>, supervisory positions responsible
for directing a sizable staff (e.g., 10-20 professional employees)
may not have subordinate supervisors, but <cite>have all other LS-2
responsibilities</cite>. Such positions should be matched to LS-2.
</p>
<p>
LS-3 Directs two subordinate supervisory levels and the work force
managed typically includes substantially more than 20 employees.
Makes major decisions and recommendations (listed below) which
have a direct, important, and substantial effect on own organization
and work. Performs <cite>at least three</cite> of the following:
</p>
<p>
- decides what programs and projects should be initiated, dropped,
expanded, or curtailed;
</p>
<p>
- determines long range plans in response to program changes,
evaluates program goals, and redefines objectives;
</p>
<p>
- determines changes to be made in organizational structure, delegation
of authority, coordination of units, etc.;
</p>
<p>
- decides what compromises to make in program operations in view
of public relations implications and need for support from various
groups;
</p>
<p>
- decides on the means to substantially reduce program operating
costs without impairing overall operations; justifies major equipment
expenditures; and
</p>
<p>
- resolves differences between key subordinate officials; decides,
or significantly affects final decisions, on personnel actions
for subordinate supervisors and other key subordinates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alternative criteria for matching Personnel Supervisor/Managers
</strong>
</p>
<p>
a. <cite>Base level artificially low</cite>. The leanness of subordinate
staff often combines with the appropriate LS level to produce
a level of supervisor/manager which is below the supervisor/manager's
level of technical expertise, as measured by the personnel specialist
definition. In these instances, raise the level of the supervisor/manager
match to correlate to the equivalent level of personnel specialist
(see chart above).
</p>
<p>
<strong><a name="director">DIRECTOR OF PERSONNEL</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
(143: Personnel, Training, and labor relations specialists)
</p>
<p>
Directs a personnel management program for an organization or
segment of an organization. Serves top management officials as
the definitive source of advice and assistance on personnel management
matters and problems generally; is typically consulted on the
personnel implications of planned changes in management policy
or programs, the effects on the organization of economic or market
trends, product or production method changes, changes in legislation,
etc.; represents management in contacts with other organizations,
dealing primarily with personnel management matters.
</p>
<p>
Typically, the director of personnel for an overall organization
reports to a policy-making official in charge of administration
and personnel management activities or to an officer of similar
level. However, in industries such as health care, banking, and
retail trade, where precedents exist for most personnel policies
and procedures, the director of personnel may report directly
to the chief operating officer. Below the headquarters level,
the director of personnel typically reports to a management official
responsible for operating an organization segment.
</p>
<p>
For a job to be covered by this definition, the personnel management
program must include significant responsibility for all three
of the following functions:
</p>
<p>
1. <cite>Administering a job evaluation systems</cite> - a system in
which there are established procedures by which jobs are analyzed
and evaluated on the basis of their duties, responsibilities,
and qualification requirements in order to provide a foundation
for equitable compensation. Such a system may include: the use
of job evaluation factors; the preparation of formal job descriptions;
and such related functions as wage and salary surveys and merit
rating system administration. The job evaluation system(s) must
cover a substantial portion of the jobs in the organization.
</p>
<p>
2. <cite>Employment and placement function</cite> - recruiting actively
for at least some kinds of workers through a variety of sources
(for example, schools or colleges, employment agencies, professional
societies); evaluating applicants against demands of particular
jobs by use of such techniques as job analysis, interviews, written
tests of aptitude, knowledge or skill, reference checks, and experience
evaluations; and recommending selections and job placements to
management.
</p>
<p>
3. <cite>Employee relations and service function</cite> - functions
designed to maintain employee morale and productivity at a high
level (for example, administering a formal or informal grievance
procedure; identifying and recommending solutions for personnel
problems such as absenteeism, high turnover, and low productivity;
administering suggestion, retirement pension, insurance, and merit
rating programs; or overseeing cafeteria operations, recreational
programs, and health and safety programs).
</p>
<p>
In addition, positions covered by this definition may, but do
not necessarily, include responsibilities in the following areas:
</p>
<p>
1. Employees training and development;
</p>
<p>
2. Labor relations activities which are confined mainly to the
administration, interpretation, and application of those aspects
of labor union contracts that are essentially of the type described
under (3) above. May also participate in bargaining of a subordinate
nature, for example, to negotiate detailed settlement of such
matters as specific rates, job classifications, work rules, or

agreement reached at higher levels, or to supply advice and information
on technical points to the organization's principal representative;
</p>
<p>
3. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO); or
</p>
<p>
4. Reporting under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA).
</p>
<p>
<cite>Excluded </cite>are:
</p>
<p>
a. Positions in which responsibility for actual contract negotiation
with labor unions as the principal representative of the organization
is a significant aspect of job, that is, a responsibility which
serves as a primary basis for qualification requirements or compensation;
</p>
<p>
b. Positions servicing less that 250 (FTE) employees;
</p>
<p>
c. Positions participating in the management and formulation of
policy for the overall organization in addition to directing its
personnel program; and
</p>
<p>
d. Positions responsible for directing a personnel program but
which do not fully meet all of the responsibilities of a director
of personnel. These positions should be matched to either the
personnel specialist or personnel supervisor/manager definition.
</p>
<p>
Director of personnel jobs which meet the above definition are
classified by level of work in accordance with the tabulation
below.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Note</cite>: There are gaps between the elements used to determine
job levels. These gaps have been provided purposely to allow room
for judgment. For example, an "operations" position
which services 850 employees should be matched at level 2 if the
organization serviced falls slightly below type B. However, the
same position should be matched at level 1 if the organization
serviced clearly fits type A.
</p>
<p>
1 "Operations level" personnel program &mdash;director of
personnel servicing an organization segment where the basic personnel
program policies, plans, and objectives are established at a higher
organizational level (for example, headquarters). The personnel
director's responsibility is to put these into operation in such
a manner as to most effectively serve local management needs.
</p>
<p>
2 "Development level" personnel program&mdash;either:
</p>
<p>
a. Director of personnel servicing an overall organization (with
or without subordinate segments) where the personnel director
plays an important role in establishment or basic personnel policies,
plans, and objectives subject to policy direction and control
from policy-making officials. In industries where precedents exist
for most personnel policies and procedures, development authority
is generally reserved for the top personnel official in an organization.
</p>
<p>
OR
</p>
<p>
b. Director of personnel servicing an intermediate organization
below the headquarters level, for example, a division or subsidiary,
to which a relatively complete delegation of personnel program
planning and development responsibility is made. In this situation,
only basic policy direction is given by the parent organization
and local officials. The director of personnel has essentially
the same degree of latitude and responsibility for establishment
of basic personnel policies, plans, and objectives as described
above in paragraph (a).
</p>
<p>
3 "Type A" organization serviced&mdash;most jobs serviced
do not present particularly difficult or unusual recruitment,
job evaluation, or training problems because the jobs consist
of relatively easy-to-understand work processes, and an adequate
labor supply is available. These conditions are mostly likely
to be found in organizations in which the work force and organizational
structure are relatively stable.
</p>
<p>
4 "Type B" organization serviced&mdash;a substantial proportion
of the jobs present difficult recruitment, job evaluation, or
training problems because the jobs: consist of hard-to-understand
work processes (for example, professional, scientific, administrative,
or technical); have hard-to-match skill requirements; are in new
or emerging occupations; or are extremely hard to fill. These
conditions are most likely to be found in organizations in which
the work force, organizational structure, work processes or functions,
etc., are complicated or unstable.

<strong><a name="tax">TAX COLLECTOR</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
(1139: Officials and administrators, public administration, not
elsewhere classified)
</p>
<p>
Collects <cite>delinquent</cite> taxes, canvasses for unreported taxes
due, secures delinquent tax returns, and counsels taxpayers on
filing and paying obligations. Tax collection typically begins
after office examination of tax returns and financial records
and subsequent notices of tax liability fail to collect full payment.
Obtains and analyzes financial information, selects appropriate
administrative or judicial remedy, and liquidates tax liability
through such measures as compromise, installment agreements, and
seizure and sale of property or other assets. Establishes liability
for and imposes various penalties under State or County revenue
codes. Serves summonses, takes testimony under oath, and testifies
in court.
</p>
<p>
Work typically requires at least three years experience in general
business or financial practices or the equivalent in education
and experience combined. Level 1 is primarily for training and
development. Level 2 is the full working level for tax collectors
who follow standard procedures and level 3 includes specialists,
team leaders, and quasi-supervisors solving moderately complex
tax collection problems.
</p>
<p>
Tax collection involves two overlapping functions - <cite>returns
investigation</cite> and <cite>collection of delinquent taxes</cite>. Returns
investigations involve analyzing financial records, examining
taxpayer's situation or business operations, and counseling taxpayers
on statutory requirements and preparation of delinquent returns.
Tax collectors primarily performing returns investigation work
are not typically found above level 2.
</p>
<p>
Collection of delinquent taxes involves analyzing a taxpayer's
financial worth and ability to pay. In resolving delinquency,
tax collectors evaluate (or use appraisers to evaluate): market
value of assets; equity shares of other creditors; liens and ownership
rights; taxpayer earning capacity; and the potential of taxpayer
businesses. If bankruptcy is imminent, tax collectors file notices
of lien to give their agency priority over subsequent creditors.
If necessary, collectors take action for seizure and make arrangements
for selling property. However, before resorting to enforced collection
procedures, they may recommend alternatives such as installment
payments, appointing escrow agents, or accepting collateral or
mortgage arrangements to protect their agency's equity.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Excluded</cite> are:
</p>
<p>
a. Tax collection supervisors. Incumbents in these full supervisory
positions typically assign, coordinate, and review work; estimate
personnel needs and schedules; evaluate performance; resolve complaints;
and make recommendations for hiring and firing; and
</p>
<p>
b. Tax auditors responsible for determining taxpayer liability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tax Collector 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
Receives formal training in: internal revenue laws, regulations,
and procedures; collection enforcement techniques and laws of
evidence and procedures; and business fundamentals. On-the-job
training is provided and progressively broader assignments are
given for development purposes. Most assignments are simple, although
more difficult work such as that encountered at level 2 may be
performed under close supervision and guidance. Individuals hired
typically have 1-2 years experience in accounting, loan, collection,
or related area or equivalent education in accounting, business
law, or related field of study.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tax Collector 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
Follows standard procedures to collect delinquent tax accounts
and secure delinquent returns. Receives specific assignments from
supervisor and works out details independently. Explains to tax
debtors sanctions which may be used in the event of nonpayment
and procedures for appealing tax bills or assessments. Compiles
prescribed records and reports. Refers problems to supervisor
which cannot be resolved by applying standard procedures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tax Collector 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
As a tax collection specialist, team leader, or quasi-supervisor,
conducts moderately complex investigations to detect or verify
suspected tax violations according to established rules, regulations,
and tax ordinances. Selects methods of approach, resolves problems
referred by lower level tax collectors, and applies all remedies
available to collect delinquent taxes. Prepares comprehensive
records and reports. Trains lower level tax collectors and assists
them in uniformly enforcing tax laws. May also assign, review,
and coordinate work of lower level tax collectors.

</strong>
</p>
<p>
(4692: Personnel clerk, except payroll and timekeeper)
</p>
<p>

personnel professional or managers in internal matters relating
to one or more personnel specialties, such as recruitment and
placement, compensation, employee relations and services, employee
development, equal employment opportunity and labor relations.
</p>
<p>
At the lower levels, assistants primarily provide basic information
to current and prospective employees, maintain personnel records
and information listings, and prepare and process papers on personnel
actions (accessions, separations, changes in pay and benefits,
etc.). At the higher levels, clerks perform work in support of
personnel professionals which requires knowledge of personnel
procedures, guides, and precedents, for example, interviewing
candidates, supervisors, and employees; recommending placements;
explaining personnel policies, benefits, and services; and preparing
personnel reports.
</p>
<p>
Final decisions on personnel actions are made by personnel professionals
or managers. Data entry and word processing may be required at
any level.
</p>
<p>
Automated (computerized) procedures may be used in personnel activities,
such as processing personnel actions and maintaining employee
and organizational records and inventories. Automation primarily
affects clerical work, that is, it reduces the need to hand flag,
count, tally, and type items, but does not generally impact on
the personnel clerical knowledge required. Typically, the automation
of personnel records will require skill in coding, sequencing,
and reconciling information.

</p>
<p>
a. Workers who primarily compute and process payrolls;
</p>
<p>

<p>
d. Positions above level 4. Workers in these excluded positions
perform duties which are similar to level 4, but which are more
complicated because they include limited aspects of professional
personnel work for a variety of conventional and stable occupations.

and guidance. Performs varied clerical and secretarial duties
requiring a knowledge of office routine and an understanding of
the organization, programs, and procedures related to the work
of the office.
</p>
<p>
<cite>Exclusions</cite>. Not all positions titled "secretary"
possess the above characteristics. Examples of positions which
are excluded from the definition are as follows:
</p>
<p>
a. Clerks or secretaries working under the direction of secretaries
or administrative assistants as described in e;
</p>
<p>
b. Stenographers not fully performing secretarial duties;
</p>
<p>
c. Stenographers or secretaries assigned to two or more professional,
technical, or managerial persons of equivalent rank;
</p>
<p>
d. Assistants or secretaries performing any kind of technical

</p>
<p>
e. Administrative assistants or supervisors performing duties
which are more difficult or more responsible than the secretarial

</p>
<p>
f. Secretaries receiving additional pay primarily for maintaining
confidentiality of payroll records or other sensitive information;
</p>
<p>
g. Secretaries performing routine receptionist, typing, and filing
duties following detailed instructions and guidelines; these duties

</p>
<p>
h. Trainees.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Classification by level</strong>
</p>
<p>
Secretary jobs which meet the required characteristics are matched
at one of five levels according to two factors: (a) level of the
secretary's supervisor within the overall organizational structure,
and (b) level of the secretary's responsibility. The table following
the explanations of these factors indicates the level of the secretary
for each combination of factors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level of secretary's supervisor (LS)</strong>
</p>
<p>
Secretaries should be matched at one of the three LS levels below
best describing the organization of the secretary's supervisor.
</p>
<p>
LS-1 Organizational structure is not complex and internal procedures
and administrative controls are simple and informal; supervisor
directs staff through face-to-face meetings.
</p>
<p>
LS-2 Organizational structure is complex and is divided into 
<cite>subordinate groups that usually differ from each other as to
subject-matter, function, etc.</cite>; supervisor usually directs
staff through intermediate supervisors; and internal procedures
and administrative controls are formal. An entire organization
(e.g., division, subsidiary, or parent organization) may contain
a variety of subordinate groups which meet the LS-2 definition.
Therefore, it is not unusual for one LS-2 supervisor to report
to another LS-2 supervisor.
</p>
<p>
The presence of subordinate supervisors does not by itself mean
LS-2 applies, e.g., a clerical processing organization divided
into several units, each performing very similar work is placed
in LS-1.
</p>
<p>
In smaller organizations or industries such as retail trade, with
relatively few organizational levels, the supervisor may have
an impact on the policies and major programs of the entire organization,
and may deal with important outside contacts, as described in
LS-3.
</p>
<p>
LS-3 Organizational structure is divided into two or more subordinate
supervisory levels (of which at least one is a managerial level)
with several subdivisions at each level. Executive's program(s)
are usually inter-locked on a direct and continuing basis with
other major organizational segments, requiring constant attention
to extensive formal coordination, clearances, and procedural controls.
Executive typically has: financial decision making authority for
assigned program(s); considerable impact on the entire organization's
financial position or public image; and responsibility for, or
has staff specialists in, such areas as personnel and administration
for assigned organization. Executive plays an important role in
determining the policies and major programs of the entire organization,
and spends considerable time dealing with outside parties actively
interested in assigned program(s) and current or controversial
issues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level of secretary's responsibility (LR)</strong>
</p>
<p>
This factor evaluates the nature of the work relationship between
the secretary and the supervisor or staff, and the extent to which
the secretary is expected to exercise initiative and judgment.
Secretaries should be matched at the level best describing their
level of responsibility. When the position's duties span more
than one LR level, the introductory paragraph at the beginning
of each LR level should be used to determine which of the levels
best matches the position. (Typically, secretaries performing
at the higher levels of responsibility also perform duties described
at the lower levels.)
</p>
