                <p><p><di3>T</di3>hat cakewalk the Buffalo Bills were on, the one nobody really believed was going to last anyway? Forget about it.</p><p>With their 25-16 loss yesterday in Miami, the Bills have established that they still have much to master and that nothing is going to come easy in the battle for supremacy in the AFC East, let alone the wider NFL.</p><p>Where they'd established themselves as comeback kids in several of their surprising early-season victories, yesterday the Bills were stumblers and bumblers, blowing a hard-won, third-quarter nine-point lead. Quarterback Trent Edwards, who had previously been so steady, was especially unreliable, turning over a pair of fumbles and being sacked for a safety.</p><p>New England, meanwhile, beat the St. Louis Rams 23-16, and all of a sudden the Patriots have drawn even with the Bills at 5-2. The New York Jets also emerged winners, 28-24 over the Kansas City Chiefs, improving to 4-3 to stay one game behind the division leaders and one game up on the 3-4 Dolphins, who continue to make last season's 1-15 finish a distant memory.</p><p>Perhaps the Bills and Edwards were overdue for such a disappointment.</p><p>On the first offensive play of the game, Miami quarterback Chad Pennington hit receiver Ted Ginn with a 46-yard pass over defensive back Terrence McGee, who was returning from a knee sprain. He would be exploited repeatedly and Ginn, just the tonic for a Miami offence badly in need of a big-play man, would wind up with seven catches for 175 yards.</p><p>Miami scored a touchdown on that initial possession. By contrast, the Bills drove the field on their first opportunity, setting up first-and-goal from the five, then handing the ball off three times in succession to Fred Jackson before having to settle for a field goal.</p><p> Why Edwards and coach Dick Jauron didn't employ No. 1 rusher Marshawn Lynch instead of Jackson on at least one rush is a topic that will be discussed long and loud this week in Buffalo.</p><p>In any case, the tone was set. Lynch would score a touchdown eventually, just as Ricky Williams rushed one in for Miami. The former Argonaut now has two TDs in his second coming with Miami. </p><p>The AFC East quarterbacks are a study in themselves. Pennington, probably the one player most responsible for Miami's quick turnaround under Bill Parcells, was pushed out of New York only after the Jets managed to land their own big fish in Brett Favre. Favre had another hallmark performance – throwing three interceptions but also piloting yet another fourth-quarter comeback drive. </p><p>Edwards, yesterday's performance aside, is a fine young quarterback, entirely capable of keeping the Bills in the thick of the race. But the Patriots have their own young gun in Matt Cassel, who also threw a fourth-quarter game winner yesterday, overcoming a pair of interceptions. He's no Tom Brady but is getting the job done the best he can in the superstar's absence. </p><p>There are reasons for the Bills and their supporters to be apprehensive. They've lost two of their last three games and haven't scored a truly overwhelming victory since Week 1 versus messed-up Seattle. </p><p>Yesterday's game marked the beginning of three in a row within the division for Buffalo, with the Jets at Ralph Wilson Stadium this week followed by a visit to New England. The ``home'' rematch vs. the Dolphins will be played at Toronto's Rogers Centre on Dec. 7. Ted and T.O are getting a game that will matter, at least.</p><p>Notably, two of the Dolphins' three wins have come within the division – over Buffalo and New England. </p><p>The Dolphins have already lost once to the Jets, who in turn have lost to the Patriots. That's competitive. </p><p>Nope, there will no cakewalks, in Buffalo or elsewhere.<br /><br /></p></p>
