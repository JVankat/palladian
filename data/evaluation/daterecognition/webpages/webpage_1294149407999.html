John 18:1-19:42</p>
</b></font>
<strong>
<p style="margin-right: 70"></strong>&nbsp;After Jesus had spoken these words,
he went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there
was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the
place, because Jesus often met there with his disciples.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers
together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came
there with lanterns and torches and weapons.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to
him, came forward and asked them, &quot;Whom are you looking for?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;They answered, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;
Jesus replied, &quot;I am he.&quot; Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with
them.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;When Jesus said to them, &quot;I am he,&quot;
they stepped back and fell to the ground.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Again he asked them, &quot;Whom are you
looking for?&quot; And they said, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">Jesus answered, &quot;I told you that I am he. So if
you are looking for me, let these men go.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;This was to fulfill the word that he had
spoken, &quot;I did not lose a single one of those whom you gave me.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it,
struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was
Malchus.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Jesus said to Peter, &quot;Put your sword back
into its sheath. Am I not to drink the cup that the Father has given me?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;So the soldiers, their officer, and the Jewish
police arrested Jesus and bound him.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;First they took him to Annas, who was the
father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews
that it was better to have one person die for the people.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Simon Peter and another disciple followed
Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into
the courtyard of the high priest,</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;but Peter was standing outside at the gate. So
the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the
woman who guarded the gate, and brought Peter in.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;The woman said to Peter, &quot;You are not
also one of this man's disciples, are you?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Now the slaves and the police had made a
charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing around it and warming
themselves. Peter also was standing with them and warming himself.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then the high priest questioned Jesus about
his disciples and about his teaching.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Jesus answered, &quot;I have spoken openly to
the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the
Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard what I
said to them; they know what I said.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;When he had said this, one of the police
standing nearby struck Jesus on the face, saying, &quot;Is that how you answer
the high priest?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Jesus answered, &quot;If I have spoken
wrongly, testify to the wrong. But if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike
me?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high
priest.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming
himself. They asked him, &quot;You are not also one of his disciples, are
you?&quot; He denied it and said, &quot;I am not.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;One of the slaves of the high priest, a
relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, &quot;Did I not see you
in the garden with him?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Again Peter denied it, and at that moment the
cock crowed.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate's
headquarters. It was early in the morning. They themselves did not enter the
headquarters, so as to avoid ritual defilement and to be able to eat the
Passover.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;So Pilate went out to them and said,
&quot;What accusation do you bring against this man?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;They answered, &quot;If this man were not a
criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate said to them, &quot;Take him yourselves
and judge him according to your law.&quot; The Jews replied, &quot;We are not
permitted to put anyone to death.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;(This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when
he indicated the kind of death he was to die.)</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then Pilate entered the headquarters again,
summoned Jesus, and asked him, &quot;Are you the King of the Jews?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Jesus answered, &quot;Do you ask this on your
own, or did others tell you about me?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate replied, &quot;I am not a Jew, am I?
Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you
done?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Jesus answered, &quot;My kingdom is not from
this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting
to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not
from here.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate asked him, &quot;So you are a
king?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;You say that I am a king. For this I was born,
and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who
belongs to the truth listens to my voice.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate asked him, &quot;What is truth?&quot;
After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, &quot;I
find no case against him.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;But you have a custom that I release someone
for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the
Jews?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;They shouted in reply, &quot;Not this man, but
Barabbas!&quot; Now Barabbas was a bandit.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed
him in a purple robe.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;They kept coming up to him, saying,
&quot;Hail, King of the Jews!&quot; and striking him on the face.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate went out again and said to them,
&quot;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case
against him.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and
the purple robe. Pilate said to them, &quot;Here is the man!&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;When the chief priests and the police saw him,
they shouted, &quot;Crucify him! Crucify him!&quot; Pilate said to them,
&quot;Take him yourselves and crucify him; I find no case against him.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;The Jews answered him, &quot;We have a law,
and according to that law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son
of God.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Now when Pilate heard this, he was more afraid
than ever.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;He entered his headquarters again and asked
Jesus, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; But Jesus gave him no answer.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate therefore said to him, &quot;Do you
refuse to speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and
power to crucify you?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Jesus answered him, &quot;You would have no
power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore the one who
handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;From then on Pilate tried to release him, but
the Jews cried out, &quot;If you release this man, you are no friend of the
emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the
emperor.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;When Pilate heard these words, he brought
Jesus outside and sat on the judge's bench at a place called The Stone Pavement,
or in Hebrew Gabbatha.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Now it was the day of Preparation for the
Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews, &quot;Here is your
King!&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;They cried out, &quot;Away with him! Away with
him! Crucify him!&quot; Pilate asked them, &quot;Shall I crucify your
King?&quot; The chief priests answered, &quot;We have no king but the
emperor.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then he handed him over to them to be
crucified. So they took Jesus;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;and carrying the cross by himself, he went out
to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;There they crucified him, and with him two
others, one on either side, with Jesus between them.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate also had an inscription written and put
on the cross. It read, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Many of the Jews read this inscription,
because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was
written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate,
&quot;Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of
the Jews.'&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Pilate answered, &quot;What I have written I
have written.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they
took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They
also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the
top.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">So they said to one another, &quot;Let us not tear
it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.&quot; This was to fulfill what
the scripture says, &quot;They divided my clothes among themselves, and for my
clothing they cast lots.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;And that is what the soldiers did. Meanwhile,
standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary
the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he
loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, &quot;Woman, here is your
son.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then he said to the disciple, &quot;Here is
your mother.&quot; And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">After this, when Jesus knew that all was now
finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), &quot;I am thirsty.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they
put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">When Jesus had received the wine, he said, &quot;It
is finished.&quot; Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Since it was the day of Preparation, the Jews
did not want the bodies left on the cross during the sabbath, especially because
that sabbath was a day of great solemnity. So they asked Pilate to have the legs
of the crucified men broken and the bodies removed.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of
the first and of the other who had been crucified with him.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;But when they came to Jesus and saw that he
was already dead, they did not break his legs.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side
with a spear, and at once blood and water came out.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;(He who saw this has testified so that you
also may believe. His testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth.)</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;These things occurred so that the scripture
might be fulfilled, &quot;None of his bones shall be broken.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;And again another passage of scripture says,
&quot;They will look on the one whom they have pierced.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who
was a disciple of Jesus, though a secret one because of his fear of the Jews,
asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission;
so he came and removed his body.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night,
also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred
pounds.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the
spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;Now there was a garden in the place where he
was crucified, and in the garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever
been laid.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&nbsp;And so, because it was the Jewish day of
Preparation, and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</p>

<font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="5">
<p style="margin-right: 70">In many ways, I love this day because it is so rich
with meaning too deep to express, meaning which is diminished if it is captured.
But in many ways, I hate this day because it is so horrible. We set this day
aside to do something which, for lovers of Jesus, is very, very unpleasant.
Before we gather on Sunday to celebrate Easter, we gather, we have to gather, on
this day to reflect on the story of Jesus� passion � his arrest, his trial,
the humiliations heaped upon him (spitting in his face, mocking him), the
torture he endures (blood dripping off his beard from beatings and a scalp
pierced by razor sharp thorns. And the flogging, mentioned almost in passing.
Many prisoners did not survive this form of Roman flogging).</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">And, of course, the cross. The first few blows on
the hammer would have been strangely quiet, until the nail got through the soft
flesh and hit the hard wood. Death was by asphyxiation, very slow, brought on by
exhaustion as the prisoner slowly could no longer muster the strength needed to
lift his torso up to take a breath. Jesus� death was no doubt hastened by loss
of blood. After what he had already been through, no wonder he died before the
criminals to his right and left.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">It is a hard day for people who love Jesus. Lots of
people, and even lots of Christian churches, just skip it. Who wants to mess up
their pretty new Easter clothes with this horror, with Jesus� blood and sweat?
Well, I don�t think you can understand the joy of Easter unless you�ve been
through the horror of Good Friday.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">But it is horrible, isn�t it? And so, as we relive
this horror that is somehow at the heart of the story of our faith, I think we
are perfectly justified in asking a simple question, &quot;What does this
mean?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">What does this story of horror mean? Why must there
be a Good Friday before there can be an Easter? What is going on here? How does
Jesus� crucifixion relate to our salvation?</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">I�m often surprised by how often this topic is
taken for granted in churches, but how infrequently it is discussed. But here we
are, with our faces splattered by the blood and sweat and horror of this day,
and so it doesn�t seem strange to ask: &quot;What does this mean?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">We have now entered the realm of theology, of
&quot;faith seeking understanding,&quot; as St. Anselm defined it. So I�m
going to talk a little theology with you. If that�s not your cup of tea,
please stick with me for a little while. It is very important.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">In theological terms, what we�re talking about is
the Atonement, literally the &quot;at-one-ment,&quot; or the understanding of
how Christ�s death works for our salvation. It�s important that you know
that the church has never settled on one theory of the Atonement. I�m going to
give you brief descriptions of three historic theories (there are others), and I
won�t mind telling you what I think of them. But the point is not that you
agree with me (or any of these theories). The point is that you develop an
understanding of Christ�s death which brings life to your faith.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">The first theory, sometimes called the
&quot;classic&quot; model, says that on the cross, Christ faced the cosmic
powers of evil, and Easter demonstrated that Christ had conquered them and
therefore saved us from them, like a great general defeating a foe. Here, Christ
appears as &quot;Savior.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">I believe that Jesus� death shows us the way to
conquer evil, but my concern with the Classic Model is that it makes it sound as
if there was a cosmic battle, Jesus won, and now it�s all over. I read the
newspaper (shoot, I look into my heart), and our struggle with evil doesn�t <i>seem</i>
to be over. But I appreciate that the Classic Model tells me that Christ can
overcome evil. I need to hear that when evil seems so powerful and so pervasive.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">The second theory is called the
&quot;Satisfaction&quot; model. This view is associated with St. Anselm, who
died in 1109. Anselm was very concerned with law and order, and this is a
judicial model. It has been sharpened a bit by Protestant churches, and now, in
the American South, it is now in the air like the pollen, so much so that many
people are taught this view as if there are no other options.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">The Satisfaction Model goes like this: humanity�s
disobedience is an affront to God, a crime. God personifies justice, and because
a crime has been committed, justice demands that someone must pay. But the
penalty for this crime is infinite satisfaction. Now, we can�t pay the penalty
for our crime because finite humans can�t make infinite satisfaction. So God
(in the form of Jesus) must do it. Christ is substituted for us and suffers
vicariously for our crime. Here, Christ appears and the one who pays the price
for us; Christ is the &quot;Redeemer.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">Those who teach this theory as if it were the only
option would do well to remember that the Church somehow managed to limp along
for a thousand years without it. And I can�t help but ask, &quot;What kind of
justice <i>is</i> this that allows me to do the crime but someone else to do the
time?&quot; Here�s a free piece of legal advice: don�t try that in court.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">But I appreciate that the Satisfaction Model reminds
me that we human beings commit offenses against God, and God is willing to
suffer on our behalf.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">The third theory, less known, is associated with a
contemporary of St. Anselm, a theologian named Peter Abelard. I�ll call it the
&quot;Loving Invitation&quot; model. While I see elements of the truth in each
of the first two theories, I resonate most with this one. Those who know me well
will not be surprised to learn that it focuses on relationship (which is the
only thing I think Christianity is ultimately about). In this case the focus is
on our relationship with God.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">The problem, this theory says, is that human beings
can�t be forced into a loving relationship with God. Lots of previous attempts
to get us to love God have failed. We humans know we have screwed up, but we
have the hardest time believing that God would forgive us and seek
reconciliation.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">In God�s relationship with us, just like our
relationships with one another, forgiveness and reconciliation always involve
suffering. Think about it: if you are going to really love a fallible human
being (who screws up), you are going to get hurt, and need to forgive. It�s
part of the package. And if they are going to love you, they are going to get
hurt. It is a truth of the universe: loving such hurtful creatures as human
beings hurts. We are constantly doing, saying, or thinking things that break our
relationships; we are constantly in need of forgiveness and reconciliation. And
forgiveness and reconciliation always involve suffering. So suffering is
necessary for loving relationships.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">And if that is true with us, think about how much
God must suffer to stay in loving relationship with us.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">And therein lies the rub: we have the hardest time
believing that God would love us <i>that</i> much. So God issues this astounding
invitation. Jesus comes, God with us, to tell us, and to show us, how to live in
loving relationship with God and one another. And how does it end? With the
sound of a hammer strangely muted, until the nails hit the hard wood. How does
it end? With horror, horror, horror.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">In the Loving Invitation Model, Christ is God�s
suffering love. The question this model poses is, &quot;<i>Now</i> can you
believe how much God is willing to sacrifice to be in loving relationship with
you?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">I find some truth in all three theories, but I�ll
tell you why I resonate with the Invitation Theory. I received an email recently
from an old friend whom I�ll call &quot;Mary.&quot; No one you know. Someone
who lives far, far away (email is an amazing thing). As some of you know, I
taught a class on &quot;forgiveness&quot; at our last Wednesday night Lenten
Supper. I emailed what I wrote up for that class to a mutual friend. It turned
out that Mary had been having an email conversation with him and had just asked
him to speak to her of forgiveness. He sent her what I sent him, and she
contacted me directly.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">Her letter was heartbreaking. It described a
childhood full of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. The effect on her life
had been devastating. She spoke of decades of self-loathing � self-loathing
which fed self-destructive behavior � self-destructive behavior which, of
course, fed the self-loathing. An endless loop of pain and destruction.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">&quot;I feel so horrible,&quot; she said. &quot;Talk
to me. Tell me whether you really believe that God can heal something so
horrible.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">Look, I don�t really care which theory of the
atonement you believe. Maybe you�ll come up with your own. And I�m aware
that none of them say it all. Good Friday is a horrible day, but it is also a
day rich with meaning too deep to express, meaning which is diminished if it is
captured.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">So, I really don�t care which theory of the
atonement you believe, but the tree will be known by its fruit, and I do care
that, whatever you come up with, it must be able to answer this question, this
question posed by the Marys of the world, this question posed by the victims of
war in the world, this question posed by all victims of every horror, this
question posed by the perpetrators of horror, this question posed by you when
you think you are surely beyond God�s embrace, this question posed by Jesus as
the hammer makes a muffled sound.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">The question the crucifixion answers for us for all
time is this:</p>
<p style="margin-right: 70">Is <i>this, this, even this,</i> too horrible for
God?</p>
