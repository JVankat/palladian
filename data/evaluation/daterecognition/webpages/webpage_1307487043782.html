<p>We're pleased to present you with this amazing voiceover glossary created by <u>Marc Cashman of Cashman Commercials</u>!</p>

<p>This glossary of terms used in the field of voice-over, or voice acting, could be one of the most comprehensive compilations of terms available.</p>

<p>It has been distilled from many sources (see bibliography) and is fairly up-to-date.</p>

<p>A few words and phrases may be arcane, but Marc wanted the glossary be as inclusive as possible.  If you find some definitions lacking in scope and/or specificity, or if you feel that some terms have been left out, we encourage you to email suggestions or suggested revisions.  If they help clarify the definition they will be incorporated into this glossary.</p>

<p>And if you have any specific questions about any of these terms, you can <a href="http://blogs.voices.com/askthevoicecat/">Ask the Voice Cat</a>.</p>

Voice-over was the term originally used to describe an announcer’s voice on a television spot, referring to the process as “voice over picture.”  The more accurate term now is voice acting, which is the art of          using the voice to bring life to written words.  </p>

<p><b>VU meter:</b>  A meter on the engineer’s console that indicates the level of sound passing through the board.</p>

<p><b>walla:</b>  The sound of many voices talking at once, used as background sounds for a party or restaurant.  Originally, it was thought that saying the words “walla walla” over and over again in the background would simulate good sound ambiance for a crowded scene, but the prevailing view now is that actors doing walla should converse in the way they would normally do so in that situation.</p>

<p><b>wet:</b>  A voice or sound with reverb added to it.</p>

<p><b>wild line:</b>  A single line from a script that is reread several times in succession until the perfect read is achieved.  It’s considered wild because it is read separately from the entire script.  Often performed in a series of three, where the actor reads the line three times in a row without interruption.  Each line is read slightly differently, unless otherwise directed.</p>

<p><b>wild spot:</b>  A flat fee for a spot that airs for an indeterminate number of times within a 13-week cycle.  Can be local, regional or national.</p>

<p><b>windscreen:</b>  A pop filter, or pop stopper.</p>

<p><b>woodshed:</b>  To rehearse or practice reading copy out loud.  From the old days of theater where actors would have to rehearse in a woodshed before going out to perform.</p>

<p><b>wrap:</b>  The end, as in “That’s a wrap.”</p>

									<p><p>Great contribution, Marc!</p>

<p>I didn't see entries for either "bumper" or "sweeper" though.  </p>

<p>Your background leaves you far more qualified to add clear definitions of these often used (& semi-mysterious) terms, if you get the chance.</p>

<p>Again, many thanks!</p></p>

									<p><p>Great glossary. I'm familiar with the amount of time and effort that must have gone into this since I've done similarly with other projects, so I very much appreciate what you have accomplished, Marc. If I were wearing a hat, it would be off to you.</p>

<p>Oh, and you might want to add "watermark"/"watermarking" and "pay-to-play"/P2P as well.</p></p>
