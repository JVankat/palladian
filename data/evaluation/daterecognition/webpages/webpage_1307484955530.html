                <p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3"><b>Dear Friend,</b>
                <p align="justify">Now that you have seen the proof and I have
                your attention, let me ask you one quick question - have you
                ever seen any Guru produce stats like these on their sales
                pages? Do you think the Internet Marketing hot shots even know
                about the existence of 2 cent keywords and 60% CTR? The answer
                is No - simply because they do not even know about the technique
                that I am going to reveal in my &quot;Two Minute Profits&quot;
                report.</p>
                <p align="justify">You see, I bumped into this technique because
                of an innocent human error on my part. I am not going to boast
                and tell you that I invented this technique using my super human
                brain. No I didn't.</p>
                <p align="justify">Way back in 2003, I was exactly where you are
                right now. I was trying hard even to make a single cent online.
                I wasted precious dollars on ebooks promising to make me an
                online millionaire. But I got no where. Not until one day, when
                I was creating an Adwords campaign for a CJ (Commission
                Junction) merchant and I made an innocent mistake. A mistake
                which made me my first $50 on the Internet. :)</p>
                <p align="justify">Next day, while going through my Adwords
                stats, I realized what had happened. I had discovered something
                truly amazing. <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">A little
                bit of research showed that no one else was using this technique</span>
                (no longer a mistake). Absolutely no one. I had a vast market to
                capitalize on.</p>
                <p align="justify">And rest, as they say, is history.&nbsp; I
                replicated the technique over and over again and I have been
                doing so for the last 4 years. And each time I create a new
                campaign, using what I like to call the &quot;Two Minute
                Profits&quot; system, I add to my stable another source of
                steady profits.</p>
                <p align="justify">So why am I revealing this technique to you?
                Well, for one thing, I am tired of seeing endless &quot;good for
                nothing&quot; ebooks hitting the market and fooling innocent
                newbies. I have been there and I know how it feels to shell out
                $47 or $97 for an ebook and then see nothing in return.
                Secondly, the market for the &quot;Two Minute Profits&quot;
                system is so large that any number of people can use it without
                affecting others in the game.</p>
                <p align="justify">I admit that when I discovered this amazing
                technique, I was hoping that no one else gets to know about it.
                But over time, I have realized that there is room for everyone.
                And I genuinely want you to make the most of this technique. For
                this reason, I have priced my report at a mere $7. More on that
                in a bit.</p>
                <p align="justify">The &quot;Two Minute Profits&quot; Report
                talks about just this one technique. Written in a concise, to
                the point manner the report is your ticket to make steady
                profits online. I am not the kinds to beat around the bush and
                this reflects in my report. If I wanted to, I could have made
                this same report into a 100 page ebook. But I know time is
                valuable to both of us - hence the &quot;no fluff, all
                matter&quot; report.</p>
                <p align="justify">And yes, before I forget, I wanted to show
                you a few more screenshots to clear any doubts in your mind.
                These are screenshots of the same campaign for another month.
                Just to show you that this is not a one time wonder.</p>

                          &quot;Internet Marketing&quot; today no longer refers
                          to a certain skill or definition of &quot;marketing
                          any product or service via Internet&quot; anymore. To
                          most people, &quot;Internet Marketing&quot; spells a<strong>
                          niche</strong> or even <strong>demand</strong>.</p>
                          <p align="left">In other words, more and more people
                          are going online in pursuit of Internet Business and
                          Marketing. So many so that the &quot;Internet
                          Marketing&quot; industry itself is becoming a <strong>niche</strong>
                          to target.</p>
                          <p align="left">The last time I have checked the
                          keyword &quot;<u>Internet Marketing</u>&quot; via
                          Overture, it yielded a good <font color="#FF0000"><strong>313,000+</strong></font>
                          counts per month! (Probably more by now, if you check
                          it out yourself!)</p>
                          <p align="left">While there is <strong>nothing</strong>
                          wrong with that - <em>as long as there is demand to
                          fill</em>, you are on your way to riches - it takes
                          some expertise and credibility on YOUR part to fill
                          this particular niche, really.</p>

                          <p align="left">A school of thought says that you <strong>CANNOT</strong>
                          possibly teach something you yourself do not know. You
                          know what else? I tend to agree with that!</p>
                          <p align="left">Sadly, it seems to be a game <strong>monopolized</strong>
                          (and even <strong>monetized</strong>) by the &quot;big
                          dogs&quot; and &quot;gurus&quot; of Internet
                          Marketing.</p>
                          <p align="left">Interestingly enough, most of these
                          &quot;gurus&quot; come from direct response or
                          marketing and selling background in spite of the irony
                          that a <strong>good majority </strong>of them are <strong>**not**</strong>
                          as computer-savvy as you think they are.</p>
                          <p align="left">But the fact <strong>boils</strong>
                          down that you are playing on THEIR turf, especially if
                          you are new to Internet Marketing and that this is
                          type of &quot;game&quot; you want to play where making

                            you to know what market we are looking at here.</p>

                            are many of those out there anyway, but I also
                            reckon that you want to get started with a business
                            you can call your own <strong>in the next hour or so</strong>
                            - and I hazard a guess you do <strong>not</strong>
                            have a few thousands dollars to invest, either.</p>

                      Make You Look Like A Thief<br>

                      <p>Here's an example to help you see it for yourself...</p>
                      <p>Imagine you have come to a seminar about your business.
                      You meet different types of people and talk to them.
                      During a break, <b>this man comes to you and starts a

                      <p>He introduces himself as &quot;<b>John - <i>the expert</i></b>&quot;
                      and tells you that he wants to share some important and
                      valuable information with you.</p>
                      <p>Let's be frank: How much do you care about hearing his
                      information?</p>
                      <p>Do you believe even for a micro-second that he could be
                      an &quot;expert&quot;? Even IF you let him tell you that
                      so-called &quot;important information&quot;, how open are
                      you to believing what he says?</p>
                      <p><b>Are you willing to do business with him?</b></p>
                      <p>OK, now let's imagine instead of John, another man
                      comes to you and introduces himself as <b>&quot;Mike - the
                      expert&quot;</b>. But he just looks like a little
                      different...</p>
                      <p align="center"><img src="images/blueman.jpg" width="123" height="135"></p>
                      <p>Mike also says he is an expert and wants to share some
                      important information with you.</p>
                      <p><b>Is there any difference</b> between your attitude
                      and the way you feel about John's and Mike's information?
                      Which one do you trust more as an expert?</p>
                      <p>Would you like to do business with...</p>
                      <p align="center"><img hspace="10" src="images/capman.jpg" width="139" height="136">

                      <p>The same goes with the design your newsletter has.</p>
                      <p>Yes, this is the important part that is shooting many
                      honest newsletter publishers in the foot.</p>
                      <p>When your newsletter has a poor and amateur design,
                      your subscribers won't believe what you tell them and will
                      feel you are only &quot;claiming&quot; to be an expert.
                      Your newsletter design will make you look like
                      &quot;John&quot; in your subscribers eyes.</p>
                      <p>So no matter how long you work on writing perfectly
                      valuable articles and send them in your newsletter, your
                      newsletter design will ruin all your efforts.</p>
                      <p>But when your newsletter has a professional and
                      trust-building design, <b>your subscribers will be all
                      ears </b>when you share your articles with them, because
                      they have this confidence in you that you are a REAL
                      respected expert who knows what he is talking about - just
                      like how you feel about &quot;Mike&quot;.</p>
                      <p>See how essential having a professional design is to
                      your newsletter success?</p>

                      Yourself</h2>
                      <p>To create a professional newsletter design, you need to
                      spend a lot of time and money to learn these programming
                      languages:<span class="style176"><img src="images/woman-frustrated.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" width="170" height="168"></span></p>
                      <ul>

                        <li>CSS</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Also you will need to learn graphic design programs
                      like:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Photoshop
                        <li>Adobe Fireworks
                        <li>Google Picasa</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Not to mention having to pay hundreds of dollars to buy
                      these software programs themselves and also buy books and
                      tutorials to learn them.</p>
                      <p>Oh, and not to mention after learning all these
                      programs, you'll still need to scratch your head for hours
                      and hours trying to come up with a professional design for
                      your newsletter.</p>
                      <p>So if you don't have so much free time or are just not
                      interested in so much hassles, let's move on to the next
                      step...</p>
                      <h2>Option #2: You May Use Free Newsletter Templates</h2>
                      <p><img src="images/woman-tired.jpg" align="right" width="157" height="150">OK,
                      this might seem more promising at first, but let's see how
                      good it really is...</p>
                      <p>There are some websites on the Internet that offer free
                      newsletter templates that you can use for your newsletter
                      at no cost - well, at least at FIRST it seems like that,
                      but in reality, this method is not free at all.</p>
                      <p><b>There are 3 problems with free templates...</b></p>
                      <p><b>1. </b>You see, to find these websites, you will <b>need
                      to spend hours searching in Google, going to different
                      websites, and trying different templates</b>.</p>
                      <p><b>And time IS money</b> - actually it's more important
                      than money because you can spend time to make money, but
                      no matter how much money you give, no one can add even one
                      second to the 24 hours you have today.</p>
                      <p>So by having to spend so much time, you are actually
                      losing your valuable time.</p>
                      <p><b>2.</b> What's more, even after finding a free
                      template that is not very bad and you decide to use it for
                      your newsletter, after a while you see <b>another
                      newsletter is actually using the exact SAME template that
                      you are using</b>.</p>
                      <p>The problem with free templates is that many freebie
                      seekers will find and use them for their own templates. So
                      the template you use for your newsletter might as well be
                      used in hundreds of other newsletters.</p>
                      <p>Now guess how much <b>it will hurt your reputation</b>
                      when your newsletter has turned into a popular and famous
                      newsletter but your subscribers came across a copy of your
                      newsletter design in the competition's newsletter?</p>
                      <p><b>3.</b> Free newsletter templates - just like
                      everything that is free - are <b>NOT as professional as
                      paid newsletter templates</b> are. Because after all, you
                      get what you pay for.</p>
                      <p>So by using free templates, you're actually missing on
                      a higher quality design that would give a more
                      professional and impressive look and feel to your
                      newsletter.</p>
                      <p>Since your newsletter is important to you and you are
                      going to spend hours of your valuable time every week or
                      so to create a new issue for it, do you really want to
                      overlook on the design of your newsletter that is very
                      important?</p>
                      <p>If you are a serious newsletter publisher, your answer
                      will be a resounding &quot;No&quot;.</p>
                      <p>So this all brings us to the last and the best

                      Reader,<br />
                      <br />
                      There are a lot of earning opportunities on the World Wide
                      Web. In fact, it would take me an entire encyclopedia to
                      enumerate all of these possibilities for your perusal.<br />
                      <br />
                      If you haven't hopped aboard the online bandwagon, then
                      you're missing so much. Imagine the many income streams
                      that pass you by. They could help supplement your income,
                      or, they may even replace the income you derive from your
                      day job. <b>The amount of earnings you can get from the
                      Internet, after all, is quite limitless</b>. You will not
                      be paid based on the hours you log in. Rather, you will
                      earn your keep based on how well you execute certain
                      strategies.<br />
                      <br />
                      I want you to realize that yes, you could earn money �
                      REAL money � from the Internet. And this is 100% UP TO
                      YOU.<br />
                      <br />
                      I want you to realize that earning money � <b>REAL money</b>
                      � through online channels is not hard, while you must
                      WORK hard towards that end. It's a business and like any
                      business you must be consistent with it.<br />
                      <br />
                      The good news is that you don't have to learn complicated
                      programming languages nor confusing techno-babble just to
                      get a grip of the way things work. All you need is, as
                      I've previously shared, the knowledge on how to properly
                      execute particular techniques.<br />

                                their own scent! Imagine the great comments and

                                pay for perfume in a store. In fact, you might
