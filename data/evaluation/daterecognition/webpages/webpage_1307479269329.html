<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="font-size:small;">&#8220;Doubt is the beginning of wisdom&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="font-size:small;"><strong><span style="font-size:small;">~Clarence Darrow~</span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p>Rational thinking refers to:</p>
<p><strong>logical or reasoning being involved in the thought process. It refers to providing reasons or rational behind thoughts or ideas. </strong>It adds an element of calculation and planning to a steam of thoughts rather then basing them on emotion or personal opinion.  Rational thinking is based on reasons or facts and is hence much more calculating and realistic. All people are capable of thinking rationally at any situation.  it is always based on facts rather than preconceived notions.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia,</p>
<p>In a number of kinds of speech, &#8220;rational&#8221; may also denote a hodge-podge of generally positive attributes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Reasonable" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable">reasonable</a>: &#8220;having sound judgment and practical implementation&#8221; (Webster&#8217;s)</li>
<li>reasonable: &#8220;not extreme or excessive&#8221; (Webster&#8217;s)</li>
<li>justifiable on the basis of <em><a title="Reason" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason">reason</a></em>. (<a title="Logical" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical">logical</a>)</li>
<li>economical, not wasteful (&#8220;rational management,&#8221; &#8220;to <a title="Rationalization (economics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(economics)">rationalize</a>&#8221; something)</li>
<li><a title="Coherence (linguistics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(linguistics)">coherent</a></li>
</ul>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>The following subjects are <strong>greatly lagging</strong> in reasons of known facts and logical supports. mostly rational thinkers reject them!</p>
<p>1. Astrology</p>
<p>2. Graphology</p>
<p>3. Numerology</p>
<p>4. Gemology</p>
<p>5. Physic Readings</p>
<p>6. Ritual practices in religions</p>
<p>7. beliefs about superstitions</p>
<p>8. beliefs about supernatural matters</p>
<p>9. strong tie-up with race and caste system</p>
<p><strong> 3 KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF ABOUT YOUR BELIEFS</strong></p>
<p>1. Does my Belief help me or hinder me over the long run?<br />
2. Is my Belief consistent with known facts and reality?<br />
3. Is my Belief logical?</p>
<p>Reason is a tool for solving problems, creating strategies, debunking nonsense and undermining dogmas. However, feeling, compassion and imagination are also important in driving and enriching our actions and thoughts. The strength of reason is that it is a powerful tool of understanding and a means of arriving at rational decisions. Human choices are not always made with complete rationality, but it is preferable to aim for the reasonable than to choose without thought.</p>

<p>The scientific process is powered by the use of reason. Much progress has come through scientific understanding, although the application of science, such as atomic explosions or genetic modification, can sometimes be dangerous. Imagination and empathy enable us to envisage the outcome of the application of science. The arts too can enlarge our concept of being human.</p>
<p>Rationalists have questioned the claims of religious thinkers and religious institutions. They may be agnostics or atheists, but they doubt the claims of the supernatural on the grounds of lack of reasonable evidence. The attitudes and injunctions of religions seem unconvincing when examined in the light of reason.</p>
<p>Rationalists envisage that the use of reason will lead to human progress &#8211; even if not in a steady upward course. Rationalists reckon that the sum of human progress may be increased by the careful and consistent use of reason.</p>
<p>Rational thinking is an exciting discovery process in an infinite space of possibilities or probabilities.  We are able to think rationally to find and reach the optimum solution for any given problem, or hypothesis in a reasonable space or time.  The process of deductive reasoning, however, should not be mistaken as rational thinking.</p>
<p>Hypothesis is a tentative explanation that accounts for a set of facts, which can be tested by further examination, a theory of something taken to be true for the purposes of deductive reasoning, assumption and investigation. Defining an Hypothesis is the precursor of a conditional statement. It must be noted here, however,  that many advanced cultures have been spoiled, and forgotten, due to the lack of creative possibilities, or Hypothesis or probabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, a healthy rational thinking requires; an adequate attention span, patience and the ability to focus, to observe, interpret, perceive and consequently develop logic.</p>
<p><em><strong>Remember, All the developments we enjoy today were made possible by rational thinking people. Human beings differ from that of most animals thanks only to rational thinking.</strong></em></p>
<p>Rational thinking is a simple process of doubting and critically analyzing anything for the improvement. For some weird reasons, rational thinking is connected to atheism. On the other hand, self-realisation is somehow connected to theism. But that is not true.</p>
<p><em><strong>This article highlights that, rational thinking is the only way to achieve self-realization for sure!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>The rational thinker versus the paranoid</strong></span></p>
<p>Presented with the same evidence for a mystery, the rational thinker and the paranoid respond very differently.</p>

<p>I am proud to say, a rational thinker and of course, happy to be.  Every one of us can think rationally without any doubt. Sometimes our old dogmas and beliefs on baseless matters won&#8217;t allow to accept it. Rational thinking is like drinking a clear and purified water.  mere belief on something is like drinking impure water. It is just without self-experiencing and not-knowing actual facts of a particular subject.  we should question about different practices in our society.</p>
<p>Is it really true?</p>
<p>Any valid reason behind that or not?</p>
<p>Are there any acceptable facts exist to support?</p>
<p>whenever I get a chance, I always try to explore more and dig into it. If I get some convincing answer, then I accept and live up to it. As we all know to the human knowledge, we have great human life. rational thinking makes us better person for sure! <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1305449712g' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<p><strong>The Tianhe-1A hits 2.507 petaflops, surpassing the Cray XT5  Jaguar of the U.S., but the official word will come from International  Supercomputing Conference in Germany. </strong></p>
<p>China has built what may be the world&#8217;s fastest  computer, a signal that the Chinese are ready to present a serious  challenge to the U.S. as the dominant force in supercomputing.</p>
<p>The Tianhe-1A, unveiled Thursday, set a performance record of 2.507  petaflops, easily surpassing the current record holder, the Cray XT5  Jaguar. Whether the Chinese system is officially crowned the world&#8217;s  fastest computer will have to wait a couple of weeks, when the Top 500  list is scheduled to be released at the International Supercomputing  Conference in Germany.</p>
<p><a href="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/china_tianjin1supercomputer_full.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-602" title="China_Tianjin1Supercomputer_full" src="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/china_tianjin1supercomputer_full.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p><img src="/DOCUME%7E1/GS/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot-14.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the meantime, the stats for the Tianhe-1A make it appear to be the  leader. The system, powered by 7,168 Nvidia Tesla M2050 GPUs and 14,336  Intel Xeon CPUs, speeded past Jaguar&#8217;s 1.75 petaflops. The latter  supercomputer, housed at the Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory, uses  224,162 Opteron processors from Advanced Micro Devices. A petaflops is  equal to 1,000 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>Designed at the National University of Defense Technology in China, the  Tianhe-1A comprises 103 computer racks that cover 17,000 square feet.  The system consumes 4.04 megawatts of electricity.</p>
<p>The Tianhe-1A couldn&#8217;t have been built without U.S.-made processors,  which remain the best in the world. However, China developed the very  fast interconnect technology that moves data between the processors and  wrote the software that runs the supercomputer.</p>
<p>Within a couple of years, China&#8217;s processor technology is expected to  advance to the point of replacing U.S.-built chips, experts say. The  country has embarked on a national effort to use home-grown technology  for core components in supercomputers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly there&#8217;s some nationalistic pride in having the fastest  computer, but it&#8217;s also a signal that the U.S. is not the dominant force  when it comes to supercomputing,&#8221; said Jack Dongarra, a computing  expert at the University of Tennessee who helped design the technology  used in testing systems on the Top 500 list.</p>
<p>The Chinese are not the first to surpass the U.S. in supercomputing.  Japan held the crown in 2002, which spurred the U.S. to work harder,  Dongarra said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would hope the same would happen again,&#8221; Dongarra told <em>InformationWeek.</em> &#8220;We need to place more effort on certain aspects of how we do our scientific computing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, the U.S. needs to spend more on education and on the  development of the software, algorithms, models and other technologies  that go into supercomputing, not just the hardware, Dongarra said.</p>
<p>The &#8220;so what&#8221; in having the fastest computer is the ability to perform  scientific research faster and with more accuracy. This has implications  in every industry that uses high-performance computing, such as  biomedicine, weather forecasting and energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;These machines can provide a competitive advantage,&#8221; Dongarra said.</p>
<p>The Tianhe-1A, housed at the National Supercomputer Center in Tianjin,  China, is fully operational. The system is being operated as an open  access system for large-scale scientific computations, according to  China, which disclosed the supercomputer&#8217;s existence at the HPC 2010  China conference.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s latest achievement came four months after the No. 2 slot in global computing with a system that clocked in at 1.271 petaflops.</p>

				<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Hinduism in the history of religions is uniquely differ from other monotheistic religions in that <strong>it does <em>not</em> have</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single founder,</li>
<li>a specific theological system,</li>
<li>a single concept of deity,</li>
<li>a single holy text,</li>
<li>a single system of morality,</li>
<li>a central religious authority,</li>
<li>the concept of a prophet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hinduism is more like an all encompasing way of life!</p>
<p><a href="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ohm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-586" title="ohm" src="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ohm.png?w=356&#038;h=367" alt="" width="356" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Hinduism is generally regarded as the world&#8217;s oldest organized religion. It consists of &#8220;<em>thousands of different religious groups that have evolved in India since 1500 BCE</em>.&#8221; <sub><strong>1</strong></sub> Because of the wide variety of Hindu traditions, freedom of belief and practice are notable features of Hinduism.</p>
<p>Hinduism has grown to become the world&#8217;s third largest religion, after <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/christ.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/islam.htm">Islam</a>. It claims about <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hinduism5.htm">950 million followers</a> &#8212; about 14% of the world&#8217;s population. <sub><strong>2</strong></sub> It is the dominant religion in India, Nepal, and among the Tamils in Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia. Significantly Indians in UK, Canada, US and Australia.</p>
<p>Estimates of the <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hinduism5.htm#us">number of Hindus in the U.S.</a> vary greatly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our estimate, for mid-2010, is 1.5 million.</li>
<li>According to the &#8220;<em>Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches</em>,&#8221; there were about 1.1 million Hindus in the U.S. during 1999. <sub><strong>3</strong></sub></li>
<li>The &#8220;<em>American Religious Identification Survey</em>&#8221; is believed to under-estimate the numbers of Hindus because of communications problems with non-English speaking households. <sub><strong>4</strong></sub> They estimated: 766,000 Hindus in 2001 and 1.2 million in 2008.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Statistics Canada</em> estimates that there were about 157,015 Hindus in Canada during 2001. Unfortunately, they only update these numbers once each decade. <sub><strong>5</strong></sub></p>

<h3>Name of the religion:</h3>
<p>This religion is called:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sanatana Dharma</strong>, &#8220;<em>eternal religion</em>,&#8221; and</li>
<li><strong>Vaidika Dharma</strong>, &#8220;<em>religion of the Vedas</em>,&#8221; and</li>
<li><strong>Hinduism </strong>&#8211; the most commonly used name in North America. Various origins for the word &#8220;<em>Hinduism</em>&#8221; have been suggested:
<ul>
<li>It may be derived from an ancient inscription translated as: &#8220;<em>The country lying between the Himalayan mountain and Bindu Sarovara is known as Hindusthan by combination of the first letter &#8216;hi&#8217; of &#8216;Himalaya&#8217; and the last compound letter &#8216;ndu&#8217; of the word `Bindu.</em>&#8216;&#8221; Bindu Sarovara is called the Cape Comorin sea in modern times. <sub><strong>1</strong></sub></li>
<li>It may be derived from the Persian word for Indian.</li>
<li>It may be a Persian corruption of the word Sindhu (the river Indus)</li>
<li>It was a name invented by the British administration in India during colonial times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Early history of Hinduism:</h3>
<p>Beliefs about the early development of Hinduism are currently in a state of flux:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The classical theory</strong> of the origins of Hinduism traces the religion&#8217;s roots to the Indus valley civilization circa 4000 to 2200 <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm">BCE</a>. The development of Hinduism was influenced by many invasions over thousands of years. The major influences occurred when light-skinned, nomadic &#8220;Aryan&#8221; Indo-European tribes invaded Northern India (circa 1500 BCE) from the steppes of Russia and Central Asia. They brought with them their religion of <em>Vedism</em>. These beliefs mingled with the more advanced, indigenous Indian native beliefs, often called the &#8220;<em>Indus valley culture.</em>&#8220;. This theory was initially proposed by Christian scholars in the 19th century. Their conclusions were biased by their pre-existing belief in the <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jf.htm">Hebrew Scriptures</a> (Old Testament). The Book of Genesis, which they interpreted literally, appears to place the creation of the earth at circa 4,000 <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm">BCE</a>, and the <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_st.htm#flood">Noachian flood</a> at circa 2,500 BCE. These dates put severe constraints on the date of the &#8220;<em>Aryan invasion</em>,&#8221; and the development of the four Veda and Upanishad Hindu religious texts. A second factor supporting this theory was their lack of appreciation of the sophisticated nature of Vedic culture; they had discounted it as primitive. <strong><sub>2 </sub></strong>The classical theory is now being rejected by increasing numbers of archaeologists and religious historians. The originators of the theory were obviously biased by their prior beliefs about the <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/evolutio.htm#age">age of the earth</a> and the biblical story of the flood of Noah.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emerging theory:</strong> The Aryan Invasion view of ancient Indian history has been challenged in recent years by new conclusions based on more recent findings in archaeology, cultural analysis, astronomical references, and literary analysis. Archaeologists, including Jim Schaffer and David Frawley, have established convincing arguments for this new interpretation. <sub><strong>3 </strong></sub>Archaeological digs have revealed that the Indus Valley culture lasted from about 3500 to 1800 <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bce.htm">BCE</a>. It was not &#8220;<em>destroyed by outside invasion, but&#8230;[by] internal causes and, most likely, floods.</em>&#8221; The &#8220;<em>dark age</em>&#8221; that was believed to have followed the Aryan invasion may never have happened. A series of cities in India have been studied by archaeologists and shown to have a level of civilization between that of the Indus culture and later more highly developed Indian culture, as visited by the Greeks. Finally, Indus Valley excavations have uncovered many remains of fire altars, animal bones, potsherds, shell jewelry and other evidences of Vedic rituals. &#8220;<em>In other words there is no racial evidence of any such Indo-Aryan invasion of India but only of a continuity of the same group of people who traditionally considered themselves to be Aryans&#8230;The Indo-Aryan invasion as an academic concept in 18th and 19th century Europe reflected the cultural milieu of the period. Linguistic data were used to validate the concept that in turn was used to interpret archeological and anthropological data.</em>&#8220; <sub><strong>2 </strong></sub>&#8220;There was no invasion by anyone.&#8221; <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';"><sub><strong>7</strong></sub></span></li>
</ul>
<p>During the first few centuries CE, many sects were created, each dedicated to a specific deity. Typical among these were the Goddesses Shakti and Lakshmi, and the Gods Skanda and Surya.</p>
<h3>Sacred texts:</h3>
<p>Hindu sacred texts are perhaps the most ancient religious texts still surviving today. Some appear to be millennia older than the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) which conservative Christians date to circa 1500 <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bce.htm">BCE</a> and liberal scholars date to <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_tora1.htm">circa 900 BCE</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The primary sacred texts of Hinduism are the <em>Vedas</em>: the <em>Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda</em>. The Vedas contain hymns, incantations, and rituals from ancient India. <sub><strong>4 </strong></sub>The<em> Rig Veda</em> (a.k.a. <em>Rigveda</em>) may be the oldest of the four. Estimates of its date of composition in oral form range from 1500 <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bce.htm">BCE</a> to 4000 BCE. The Yajur and Atharva Vedas refer to the vernal equinox having occurred in the Pleiades constellation &#8212; an event dating from about 2500 BCE.The date when the Vedas were placed in written form is unknown. Various dates from 600 to after 300 <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm">BCE</a> have been suggested.
<ul>
<li>The Upanishadas deal with Vedic philosophy and form the conclusions of each of the Vedas. <em>&#8220;They elaborate on how the soul (Atman) can be united with the ultimate truth (Brahman) through contemplation and mediation, as well as the doctrine of Karma&#8211; the cumulative effects of a persons&#8217; actions.</em>&#8220; <sub><strong>4</strong></sub></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An important text is the <em>Ramayana</em>. Various sources have dated it to:
<ul>
<li>The first century <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm">CE</a> in written form, based on oral traditions dating back six or seven centuries earlier. <sub><strong><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';">4</span></strong></sub></li>
<li>4th century <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bce.htm">BCE</a> in written form, based on oral traditions dating back to 1500 BCE. <sub><strong><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';">6</span></strong></sub></li>
<li>4000 <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bce.htm">BCE</a> in oral form, based on astronomical constellations and other features mentioned. <sub><strong><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';">6</span></strong></sub></li>
</ul>
<p>It is &#8220;<em>a moving love story with moral and spiritual themes that has deep appeal in India to this day</em>&#8220; <sub><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';"><strong>6</strong></span></sub>concerning the exploits of the hero Rama who is viewed as an avatar of Vishnu, and as &#8220;<em>&#8230;a principal deity in his own right</em>.&#8221; <sub><strong><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';">7</span></strong></sub> The written form has been attributed to the poet Valmiki.</li>
<li>The <em>Mahabharata </em>is a group of books attributed to the sage Vyasa. They have been variously dated as having been composed between 540 and 300 BCE, between 200 BCE and 2000 CE, the to the 15th century BCE. They record &#8220;<em>the legends of the Bharatas, one of the Aryan tribal groups.</em>&#8221; The <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> is the sixth book of the Mahabharata. It is a poem describing a conversation between a warrior Arjuna and the God Krishna. It is an ancient text that has become a main sacred text of Hinduism and other belief systems.</li>
<li>Other texts include the <em>Brahmanas</em>, the <em>Sutras</em>, <em>Puranas</em>, and the <em>Aranyakas</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these sacred texts are available online. <sub><strong>4 </strong></sub>One web site has a search engine available.<sub><strong> 5</strong></sub></p>
<hr />
<h3>Hindu beliefs and practices:</h3>
<p>Categorizing the religion of Hinduism is somewhat confusing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hinduism has commonly been viewed in the west as a <strong><span style="color:#006699;"><em>polytheistic</em></span></strong> religion &#8211; one which worships multiple deities: gods and goddesses. Although a widespread belief, this is not particularly accurate.</li>
<li>Some have viewed it as a <strong><span style="color:#006699;"><em>monotheistic</em></span></strong> religion, because it recognizes only one supreme God: the panentheistic principle of <strong>Brahman</strong>, that all reality is a unity. The entire universe is seen as one divine entity who is simultaneously at one with the universe and who transcends it as well.</li>
<li>Some view Hinduism as <strong><span style="color:#006699;"><em>Trinitarian</em></span></strong> because Brahman is simultaneously visualized as a triad &#8212; one God with three persons:
<ul>
<li><strong>Brahma</strong> the Creator who is continuing to create new realities</li>
<li><strong>Vishnu</strong>, (Krishna) the Preserver, who preserves these new creations. Whenever <strong>dharma</strong> (eternal order, righteousness, religion, law and duty) is threatened, Vishnu travels from heaven to earth in one of ten incarnations.</li>
<li><strong>Shiva</strong>, the Destroyer, is at times compassionate, erotic and destructive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strictly speaking, most forms of Hinduism are <strong><span style="color:#006699;"><em>henotheistic</em></span></strong>; they recognize a single deity, and recognizes other gods and goddesses as facets, forms, manifestations, or aspects of that supreme God.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most urban Hindus follow one of two major divisions within Hinduism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vaishnavaism: which generally regards Vishnu as the ultimate deity</li>
<li>Shivaism: which generally regards Shiva as the ultimate deity.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, many rural Hindus worship their own village goddess or an earth goddess. She is believed to rule over fertility and disease &#8212; and thus over life and death. The priesthood is less important in rural Hinduism: non-Brahmins and non-priests often carry out ritual and prayer there.</p>
<p>Hindus believe in the repetitious <em>Transmigration of the Soul</em>. This is the transfer of one&#8217;s soul after death into another body. This produces a continuing cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth through their many lifetimes. It is called <em>samsara</em>.<em>Karma</em> is the accumulated sum of ones good and bad deeds. Karma determines how you will live your next life. Through pure acts, thoughts and devotion, one can be reborn at a higher level. Eventually, one can escape samsara and achieve enlightenment. Bad deeds can cause a person to be reborn as a lower level, or even as an animal. The unequal distribution of wealth, prestige, suffering are thus seen as natural consequences for one&#8217;s previous acts, both in this life and in previous lives.</p>
<p>Hindus organize their lives around certain activities or &#8220;<em>purusharthas</em>.&#8221; These are called the &#8220;<em>four aims of Hinduism</em>,&#8221; or &#8220;<em>the doctrine of the fourfold end of life</em>.&#8221; They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The three goals of the &#8220;<em>pravritti,</em>&#8221; those who are in the world, are:
<ul>
<li><em>dharma:</em> righteousness in their religious life. This is the most important of the three.</li>
<li><em>artha:</em> success in their economic life; material prosperity.</li>
<li><em>kama:</em> gratification of the senses; pleasure; sensual, sexual, and mental  enjoyment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The main goal for the &#8220;<em>nivritti,</em>&#8221; those who renounce the world. is:
<ul>
<li><em>moksa:</em> Liberation from &#8220;<em>samsara</em>.&#8221; This is considered the supreme goal of mankind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meditation is often practiced, with Yoga being the most common. Other activities include daily devotions, public rituals, and <em>puja,</em> a ceremonial dinner for a God.</p>
<p>Hinduism has a deserved reputation of being highly tolerant of other religions. Hindus have a saying: &#8220;<em>Ekam Sataha Vipraha Bahudha Vadanti,</em>&#8221; which may be translated: &#8220;<em>The truth is One, but different Sages call it by Different Names&#8221;</em></p>

<p><strong>What is the Caste System in Hindu?</strong></p>
<p>The Hindu caste system is unique in the world, but resembles in some ways Plato&#8217;s ideal society of philosophers, warriors and commoners. A caste is a division of society based on occupation and family lineage. Hindu caste system recognized four distinct classes or divisions among people based on these criteria and enforced it through a rigid code of conduct that was specific to each class and rooted in the dharmashastras (law books) of the later vedic period. The four main castes recognized by traditional Hindu society based primarily on hereditary occupation are mentioned below.</p>
<p><strong>Brahmins</strong></p>
<p>They are the priestly class, who are entitled to study the Vedas, perform rites and rituals for themselves and for others and obliged to observe the sacraments. They are the middle men between gods and men. The act as temple priests and invoke gods on behalf of others. They are expected to show exemplary behavior and spend their lives in the pursuit of divine knowledge and preservation of the traditions. According to Manu, the law maker, a brahmin was an incarnation of dharma (sacred tradition), born to serve and protect the dharma. He belonged to the excellent of the human race, endowed with intelligence and knowledge to attain Brahman. He was the highest on earth, the lord of all created beings. Whatever that existed in the world was the property of a Brahmana and he was entitled to all.</p>
<p><strong>Kshatriyas</strong></p>
<p>They are the warrior class, who are commanded (by tradition) to protect the people,  bestow gifts to the brahmins, offer sacrifices to gods and ancestors, study the Vedas, dispense justice, and, according to Manusmriti, abstain themselves from sensual pleasures. Manu laid down that it was a king&#8217;s duty to protect his kingdom and his people. He had something in himself of the gods such Indra, Vayu, Yama, Surya, Varuna, Moon and Kubera. A king should not be despised even if he was an infant. His authority should not be questioned except when he ignored his duties in supporting and protecting brahmins. The king had the right to punish, but he must be fair in his punishment. It was king&#8217;s responsibility to protect the caste system and the social order and lavish the priests with generous gifts at every opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Vaishyas</strong></p>
<p>They are the merchant and peasant classes, who are expected to tend cattle, offer sacrifices, study the Vedas, trade, lend money and cultivate the land. They had the right to perform and participate in certain vedic rituals but they were not allowed to marry women of higher castes.</p>
<p><strong>Shudras</strong></p>
<p>The are the labor class, whose only duty is to serve the other three castes. They were not required to observe any vedic rituals or samskaras except a few. They were not allowed to study the vedas or even hear the sacred chants. They were not allowed to eat food in the company of higher castes or marry their women.</p>
<p><strong>Chandalas</strong></p>
<p>The lowest of the sudras were called chandalas or the impure ones. They were treated as untouchables because of their gory religious practices, penchant for sacrifices, magical rites and unclean habits. In ancient times they were not allowed to enter a village or city during day time or walk in the same street where men of other castes walked. Even their shadow was considered impure and their very sight as a bad omen. So they lived mostly on the fringes of society, unknown and uncared for, following some esoteric religion of their own and working mostly in the graveyards and cremation grounds or as hunters, butchers and professional cleaners of human waste.</p>
<p><strong>By Jayaram V</strong></p>
<p>1. According to Hinduism God is One, but also Many. The One becomes many and the many have to begin their journey finally towards the One as a process of creation.</p>
<p>2. Hinduism believes that man is divine in nature. The basic purpose of a human being is to realize this divine nature in him.</p>
<p>3. Hinduism firmly declares that the ego or ahamkar is the root cause of all suffering. If an individual has to escape from suffering he has to cease to be his egoistic self and identify himself with his limitless inner self.</p>
<p>4. Hinduism believes unquestionably that the world is an illusion or maya. Attachment with it is the cause of birth and death. When a person overcomes this illusion through detachment and withdrawal of senses he will become qualified for self-realization.</p>
<p>5. The Hindus believe in reincarnation or rebirth, according to which each individual lives many lives because of his ignorance and the play of maya before he attains liberation.</p>
<p>6. Hinduism believes that all beings have souls, are equally important in the scheme of creation and that they all evolve continuously till they achieve final freedom. Man is but one stage in this evolution of life and in the soul&#8217;s upward journey towards such liberation. This is the reason why many Hindus choose to remain as vegetarians throughout their lives.</p>
<p>7. Hinduism believes in the concept of incarnation of God. According to this concept God is an active and dynamic principle, who sometimes descends into the earth&#8217;s consciousness directly and assumes human form to protect the weak and restore world Order.</p>
<p>8. Hinduism has given to the world the concept of karma, according to which all actions produce positive or negative reactions and effect our lives. There is however no scope here for fatalism. Actions done as an offering to God do not effect us. Sacrifice through surrendering to God is therefore the basis of salvation. Hinduism offers the best way to live a life devoid of anxieties and worries. It says, &#8220;Live your normal life, offering all your actions and possessions mentally to God in the spirit of sacrifice without bothering about the results of your actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>9. Hinduism gives immense freedom to each individual to choose whatever path he or she wants to choose. It does not believe in super imposition of faith from outside, nor changing of ones faith to another because it is more attractive. Each has to pursue the path of God according to his or her inner nature and evolution. Hinduism says, &#8220;Follow your own self, live according to your own dharma and discover you own truth that is in harmony with yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>10. Finally Hinduism does not believe in converting people from one faith to faith in an organized way. If an individual want to change his religion that is his inner choice. But no one should force him or tempt him to change. Hinduism strictly prohibits teaching of the scriptures to people who are not inclined to understand them or follow them. There are many ways in which one can approach God. All paths in the end lead to Him only.</p>

<p><strong>Holly Books &#8211; An overview</strong></p>
<p>The most sacred scriptures of Hinduism are the <strong>Vedas (&#8220;Books of Knowledge&#8221;)</strong>, a collection of texts written in Sanskrit from about 1200 BCE to 100 CE. As <em>sruti</em>, the Vedas are regarded as the absolute authority for religious knowledge and a test of Hindu orthodoxy (both Jains and Buddhists reject the Vedas). &#8220;For Hindus, the Veda is a symbol of unchallenged authority and tradition.&#8221; <a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/texts/vedas.htm#1">{1}</a> Selections from the Vedas are still memorized and recited for religious merit today. Yet much of the religion presented in the Vedas is unknown today and plays little to no role in modern Hinduism.</p>
<p>As historical and religious literature often is, the text is written from the perspective of the most powerful groups, priests and warrior-kings. Scholars say it is therefore unlikely that it represents the totality of religious belief and practice in India in the first millennium BCE. This perspective is especially evident in the earlier parts of the Vedas, in which the primary concerns are war, rain, and dealing with the &#8220;slaves,&#8221; or native inhabitants of India.</p>
<p>Initially, the Vedas consisted of four collections of mantras (<strong>Samhitas</strong>), each associated with a particular priest or aspect of ritual: <strong>Rig Veda</strong> (Wisdom of the Verses); <strong>Sama Veda</strong> (Wisdom of the Chants); <strong>Yajur Veda</strong> (Wisdom of the Sacrificial Formulas); and <strong>Atharva Veda</strong> (Wisdom of the Atharvan Priests).</p>
<p>Over the centuries, three kinds of additional literature were attached to each of the Samhitas: <strong>Brahmanas</strong>(discussions of the ritual); <strong>Aranyakas</strong> (&#8220;books studied in the forest&#8221;); and <strong>Upanishads</strong> (philosophical writings).</p>
<p>In these later texts, especially the Upanishads, the polytheism of the earlier Vedas has evolved into a pantheism focused on Brahman, the supreme reality of the universe. This concept remains a key feature of Hindu philosophy today.</p>
<h2><a name="samhitas"></a>Samhitas</h2>
<p>As noted above, the Samhitas (&#8220;Collections&#8221;) are the oldest components of the Vedas, and consist largely of hymns and mantras. There are four Samhitas (also called Vedas): Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda.</p>
<h4>The Rig Veda<a name="rig"></a></h4>
<p>Composed as early as 1500 BC, the Rig Veda or Rg Veda (&#8220;Wisdom of the Verses&#8221;) is the oldest of the four Vedic collections and one of the oldest surviving sacred texts in the world. The Rig Veda consists of 10,552 verses (collected into 10 books) of hymns and mantras used by the <em>hotri </em>priests.</p>
<p>The hymns of the Rig Veda focus on pleasing the principal gods Indra (war, wind and rain), Agni (the sacrificial fire), Surga (the sun) and Varuna (the cosmic order) through ritual sacrifices. Along with governing important matters of life such as rain, wind, fire and war, the Vedic gods also forgive wrongdoing (5.85.7) and mete out justice in the afterlife (1.97.1).</p>
<p>Deceased ancestors are able to influence the living (10.15.6), so they are also appeased with rituals (10.15.1-11). The afterlife of the Rig Veda is eternal conscious survival in the abode of Yama, the god of the dead (9.113.7-11). It is the gods, not karma, that are responsible for assuring justice in this life and the next (7.104).</p>
<h4>Yajur Veda and Sama Veda<a name="sama"></a></h4>
<p>Both the Yajur Veda (&#8220;Wisdom of the Sacrifical Formulas&#8221;) and the Sama Veda (&#8220;Wisdom of the Chants&#8221;) are liturgical works consisting primarily of selections from the Rig Veda. The Yajur Veda was used by <em>udgatri </em>priests and contains brief prose to accompany ritual acts, many of which are addressed to the ritual instruments and offerings. The Sama Veda was chanted in fixed melodies by the <em>adhvaryu</em> priests. Each contain about 2,000 verses.</p>
<h4>Atharva Veda<a name="atharva"></a></h4>
<p>The Atharva Veda (&#8220;Wisdom of the Atharvan Priests) was added significantly later than the first three Samhitas, perhaps as late as 500 BC. It consists of 20 books of hymns and prose, many of which reflect the religious concerns of everyday life. This sets the Arharva Veda apart from the other Vedas, which focus on adoring the gods and performing the liturgy of sacrifice, and makes it an important source of information on the practical religion and magic of the time.</p>
<p>Books 1 through 8 of the Atharva Veda contain magical prayers for long life, prosperity, curses, kingship, love, and a variety of other specific purposes. Books 8 through 12 include cosmological hymns, marking a transition to the loftier philosophy of the Upanishads. The remainder of the books consist of magical and ritual formulas, including marriage and funeral practices.</p>
<h2>Brahmanas<a name="brahmanas"></a></h2>
<p>The mythology and significance behind the Vedic rituals of the Samhitas are explained in the Brahmanas. Although they include some detail as to the performance of rituals themselves, the Brahmanas are primarily concerned with the meaning of rituals. A worldview is presented in which sacrifice is central to human life, religious goals, and even the continuation of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Included in the Brahmanas are extensive rituals for royal consecration (<em>rajasuya</em>), which endow a king with great power and raise him to the status of a god (at least during the ceremony). Part of the ritual is the elaborate horse sacrifice (<em>asvamedya</em>), in which a single horse is set free, followed and protected by royal forces for a year, then ritually sacrificed at the royal capital.</p>
<h2>Aranyakas (&#8220;Forest Books&#8221;)<a name="aranyakas"></a></h2>
<p>The Aranyakas contain similar material as the Brahmanas and discuss rites deemed not suitable for the village (thus the name &#8220;forest&#8221;). They also prominently feature the word brahmana, here meaning the creative power behind of the rituals, and by extension, the cosmic order.</p>
<h2>Upanishads (&#8220;Sittings Near a Teacher&#8221;)<a name="upanishads"></a></h2>
<p>The word &#8220;Upanishad&#8221; means &#8220;to sit down near,&#8221; bringing to mind pupils gathering around their teacher for philosophical instruction. The Upanishads are philosophical works that introduce the now-central ideas of self-realization, yoga, meditation, karma and reincarnation.</p>
<p>The theme of the Upanishads is the escape from rebirth through knowledge of the underlying reality of the universe. The <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em> explains how this change in perspective came about:</p>
<blockquote><p>Throughout the later Vedic period, the idea that the world of heaven was not the end-and that even in heaven death was inevitable-had been growing. For Vedic thinkers, the fear of the impermanence of religious merit and its loss in the hereafter, as well as the fear-provoking anticipation of the transience of any form of existence after death, culminating in the much-feared repeated death (<em>punarmrtyu</em>), assumed the character of an obsession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The older Upanishads are affixed to a particular Veda, but more recent ones are not. The most important Upanishads are generally considered to be the Brhadaranyaka (&#8220;Great Forest Text&#8221;) and the Chandogya (pertaining to the Chandoga priests). Both record the traditions of sages (<em>rishis</em>) of the period, most notably Yajñavalkya, who was a pioneer of new religious ideas. Also significant are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mandukya Upanishad</li>
<li>Kena/Talavakara Upanishad</li>
<li>Katha Upanishad</li>
<li>Mundaka Upanishad</li>
<li>Aitareya Upanishad</li>
<li>Taittiriya Upanishad</li>
<li>Prashna Upanishad</li>
<li>Isha Upanishad</li>
<li>Shvetashvatara Upanishad</li>
</ul>

				<p><strong>Organic company growth</strong></p>
<p>We can classify like Organic Startups or Inorganic Startups</p>
<p>If we talk about organic way, a startup can develop from the scratch by understanding what exactly the founders are willing to provide solutions to some real world problems and slowly create business in the market. we call it as organic growth. thats what happened to Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. the founders started their work by giving solutions to the real world problems of the industry first and put their efforts by writing code DOS to Microsoft, Interpreter to Altiar machine in the early stages of Apple and developed a university facebook network at Harvard University. once they were successful, they expanded their operation and grow their company on later stages.</p>
<p>Inorganic way is, to create some products based on demand in the market and sell it to potential buyers. it is most likely to understand market needs. think about to provide a solution and prepare a business plan, do some basic business studies. it will be carried out as a startup. according to the concept uniqueness, we can say that weather  we can start our company in organic or on need basis by inorganic way.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a distinction between making a product and building a company around the product. If you think about big themes and fixing a process that&#8217;s broken, maybe the company part comes naturally. Some businesses just create a product and sell it. Sell more and increase the price to get more profit.  So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I&#8217;d encourage you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p>its one of the biggest challenges during startup stage. its not advisable to spend more money on marketing in the very beginning. but have to choose effective ways to promote company&#8217;s product or services. there are following ways that can minimize our cost. &#8220;its like through your fish net where fishes are swimming&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Networking with similar web sites</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Online places where your customers are gathering</li>
<li>Google Adwords (to the minimum cost first, more later)</li>
<li>Affiliate Marketing</li>
<li>Target freelancers for viral marketing</li>
<li>Online Communities</li>
<li>Small businesses</li>
<li>Email Marketing</li>
<li>Lead Generation techniques</li>
<li>SEO methods</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Aspects of your business</strong></p>
<p>if you are thinking of starting a company in USA, I can give u an idea about different business entities. You can decide what kind of business entity you want to choose for your startup.</p>
<div style="text-align:left;"><span style="border-collapse:collapse;">Whether you are going it alone or with another person, it is best to consult a lawyer to determine which form of business organization will be best for you. Your choices and the benefits of each form are essentially as follows.</span></div>
<div style="text-align:left;"><span style="border-collapse:collapse;"><br />
</span></div>
<p><strong>Forms of Business Ownership</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>There are some points to keep in mind before you select the form of ownership. This decision will have long-term implications. Your choice will be based on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your vision regarding the size and nature of your business.</li>
<li>The level of control you wish to have.</li>
<li>The level of &#8220;structure&#8221; you are willing to deal with.</li>
<li>The business&#8217;s vulnerability to lawsuits.</li>
<li>Tax implications of the different ownership structures.</li>
<li>Expected profit (or loss) of the business.</li>
<li>Whether or not you need to re-invest earnings into the business.</li>
<li>Your need for access to cash out of the business for yourself.</li>
<li>The risks of your personal assets from business liabilities.</li>
<li>Are their partners and/or investors that will be part of the business.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sole Proprietorships</strong></p>
<p>The vast majority of small business start out as sole proprietorships . . . very dangerous. These firms are owned by one person, usually the individual who has day-to-day responsibility for running the business. Sole proprietors own all the assets of the business and the profits generated by it. They also assume &#8220;complete personal&#8221; responsibility for all of its liabilities or debts. In the eyes of the law, you are one in the same with the business.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>In a Partnership, two or more people share ownership of a single business. Like proprietorships, the law does not distinguish between the business and its owners. The Partners should have a legal agreement that sets forth how decisions will be made, profits will be shared, disputes will be resolved, how future partners will be admitted to the partnership, how partners can be bought out, or what steps will be taken to dissolve the partnership when needed. Yes, its hard to think about a &#8220;break-up&#8221; when the business is just getting started, but many partnerships split up at crisis times and unless there is a defined process, there will be even greater problems. They also must decide up front how much time and capital each will contribute, etc.</p>
<p>Types of Partnerships that should be considered:</p>
<p><strong>General Partnership</strong><br />
Partners divide responsibility for management and liability, as well as the shares of profit or loss according to their internal agreement. Equal shares are assumed unless there is a written agreement that states differently.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Partnership and Partnership with limited liability</strong><br />
&#8220;Limited&#8221; means that most of the partners have limited liability (to the extent of their investment) as well as limited input regarding management decisions, which generally encourages investors for short term projects, or for investing in capital assets. This form of ownership is not often used for operating retail or service businesses. Forming a limited partnership is more complex and formal than that of a general partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Venture</strong><br />
Acts like a general partnership, but is clearly for a limited period of time or a single project. If the partners in a joint venture repeat the activity, they will be recognized as an ongoing partnership and will have to file as such, and distribute accumulated partnership assets upon dissolution of the entity.</p>
<p><strong>Corporations:</strong></p>
<p>A corporation, chartered by the state in which it is headquartered, is considered by law to be a unique &#8220;entity&#8221;, separate and apart from those who own it. A corporation can be taxed; it can be sued; it can enter into contractual agreements. The owners of a corporation are its shareholders. The shareholders elect a board of directors to oversee the major policies and decisions. The corporation has a life of its own and does not dissolve when ownership changes.</p>
<p><strong>Subchapter S Corporations</strong></p>
<p>A tax election only; this election enables the shareholder to treat the earnings and profits as distributions, and have them pass thru directly to their personal tax return. The catch here is that the shareholder, if working for the company, and if there is a profit, must pay herself wages, and it must meet standards of &#8220;reasonable compensation&#8221;. This can vary by geographical region as well as occupation, but the basic rule is to pay yourself what you would have to pay someone to do your job, as long as there is enough profit. If you do not do this, the IRS can reclassify all of the earnings and profit as wages, and you will be liable for all of the payroll taxes on the total amount.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</strong><br />
The LLC is a relatively new type of hybrid business structure that is now permissible in most states. It is designed to provide the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership.</p>
<p>The owners are members, and the duration of the LLC is usually determined when the organization papers are filed. The time limit can be continued if desired by a vote of the members at the time of expiration. LLC&#8217;s must not have more than two of the four characteristics that define corporations: Limited liability to the extent of assets; continuity of life; centralization of management; and free transferability of ownership interests.</p>
<p>Obviously there are variations in these rules, and you should consult with your attorney and/or accountant in each specific case to determine what form of organization best fits your needs!</p>

				<p>This meeting has been held at NYU Stern Business School, discussion with four tech founders about how they started their tech company which is based on web services, how they faced challenges along the way and their ideas and views. they also shared some useful tips for the new startups. it was a good one. keep reading this post. well, I summarized the discussion briefly about the meeting and discussions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://static.businessinsider.com/image/4c3dd1f27f8b9a3b04b90600/start-up.jpg" alt="start up" /></p>
<p>there were 4 panelist, they were startups guys like few years ago. let me talk about them in brief.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anthony Casalena</strong>, Founder of <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a></li>
<li><strong>Spencer Fry</strong>, Co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://carbonmade.com/">Carbonmade</a></li>
<li><strong>Danny Wen</strong>, Co-founder of <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a></li>
<li><strong>Anthony Volodkin</strong>, Founder of <a href="http://hypem.com/">The Hype Machine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>let me say, I guess all four founders should be in their late 20&#8242;s. they are not old like in 40&#8242;s and 50&#8242;s! young aspiring achievers!</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Casalena</strong><br />
Anthony is the founder of <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, a design-centric web publishing platform that he started at age 20. Since 2003, Squarespace has hosted tens of thousands of websites, and has grown to 35 employees. In July of 2010, Index Ventures and Accel Partners led a $38.5M minority investment into Squarespace, representing the first outside capital the company raised to date. Prior to Squarespace Anthony was responsible for the design and implementation of <a href="http://www.hyperoffice.com/">HyperOffice</a>, a venture backed web startup with $10M in financing.</p>
<p><strong>Spencer Fry</strong><br />
Spencer is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://carbonmade.com/">Carbonmade</a>, an online portfolio management tool for artists, designers and illustrators. Carbonmade was founded in 2005 and now hosts over 260,000 portfolios and 4 million images. Prior to founding Carbonmade, Spencer founded hosting service TypeFrag, and sold four years later. Both TypeFrag and Carbonmade were profitable and bootstrapped with a total of $200 in capital.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Volodkin</strong><br />
Anthony is founder of <a href="http://hypem.com/">The Hype Machine</a>, a music search engine that indexes audio files and blogs posts to help people discover new artists, buy their CDs and go to their shows. The site, created in Anthony&#8217;s dorm room in 2005 now reaches over 2 million people each month. Prior to Hype Machine, Anthony spent six years doing IT consulting while constantly carving out evenings to see live music.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Wen</strong><br />
Danny is the co-founder of <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a>, an online time tracking and invoicing solution for small business and freelancers called the &#8220;crème de la crème of time tracking applications&#8221;. Prior to launching Harvest, Danny co-founded Iridesco, a New York City-based design and technology studio. His ventures to date have been bootstrapped, profitable and enjoyable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://creditcardforum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/startup-capital-300x299.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>basically, all of them have few common characteristics.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Definitely no big investment</li>
<li>Only 2 or 3 people in the early stage</li>
<li>All partners and co-founders shared the same vision</li>
<li>Patient, patient and patient</li>
<li>Not focused on generating money, no hurry!</li>
<li>In the early stage, 1-3 strong technical guys only</li>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">Solution to an interesting problem which has not done before</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">Most importantly, great passion to build their company!</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Idea Generating</strong></p>
<p>Ideas are everywhere. their is no shortage of ideas. well, thats not the simple thing to do. sometimes we cook the same old rice in a different pot. we can&#8217;t say that its a new dish without adding different flavor and ingredients! if the ideas are fresh and no one has done it before, it gets the attention of mass medias or a particular business group.</p>
<p>ideas must be the one which should not already in the market. if we are doing the same what others have already done, then there is a big competition to face them. promotional activities and marketing campaign may be cumbersome.  and obviously we are not the market pioneers since its like a copy cat idea!</p>
<p>primarily, think about the following while talking about your idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>consider fresh ideas to solve some real business problems</li>
<li>ideas about where a mass market with less competition</li>
<li>ideas of a different approach for an existing model</li>
<li>innovative methods which can change the present sceanario</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Team Building</strong></p>
<p>in the early stage of startups, none of these four guys had a big team. 2 or 3 technical guys only. even they are all in all like founders, programmers and managers! they said that it is not necessary to have a group of team like project leaders, system architect, business analyst and developers and designers. in fact, they don&#8217;t have such a usual setup like an IT company. during early stages, the only advantage they had with them is really a strong technical background, passion, enthusiasm and continuously working on to build quality products.</p>
<p>they were like only 1-3 people and also continued in the same way for 1-2 years, just continuously building the site, design, develop and adding more features without losing enthusiasm which creates a great product or service right now!</p>
<p><strong>Driving Force</strong></p>
<p>All of them wanted to build some web product or services which is needy, fresh and most wanted in the business market. their ideas has some purpose to solve certain kind of existing business problem or issues.  its interesting to see that they were continuously working on product development during early stages. they only focus on building quality products. delivering a quality product is their ultimate goal rather than concentrating quick money!</p>
<p><strong>Revenue Model</strong></p>
<p>basically, its simple one. subscription basis. users can select monthly or yearly options. there is no catch here. however, there is a free trial period like 14 days or 30 days. as long as the quality of product or service is really good, we can deliver as free service in the beginning to get more customers. we have enough confident of holding them later on since we believe on our quality service or products. no need to design a complex pricing structure or revenue models. keep it simple and reasonable. mostly subscription or advertisement model works well. if these is some level of competition then keep it minimum pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Investment</strong></p>
<p>web based services or products may need good funding in the later stages but not in the beginning. you have to keep it very minimum during early stage of development. and no need huge money as well. these founders invested very little except one guy, he invested about $25k and others like $5k, $10k and interestingly one guy said, it was $200 only!</p>
<p>well, definitely investment is not a problem if you build a quality product or services when the company is growing up. you can get it done after 3 or 4 years later. for example, squarespace.com secured outside funding only after 7 years! he raised $10 million which was not possible during early stages.</p>
<p><strong>There is no need to rush</strong></p>
<p>yeah! its another principle from these founders which they followed during early stages of development. people are so hurry to get the things done either setting up or working together. in terms of generating revenue, they may feel like there is no cash flow, no cash flow! well, if you really focus on generating revenue daily during your early stages of product development, then open a retail grocery store and sell some sodas or open a restarunt and sell some sandwich or pizza!</p>
<p>guys, what we are building here is a web based product or services. we have to focus on building really a good product which includes attractive features and aim to solve certain kind of business problem. you have to spend good amount of time and may be 3 to 6 months before the initial launch. thereafter, you have to get feedbacks and do reviews from users.  if you don&#8217;t have patient and enthusiasm, things doesn&#8217;t work. you have to wait 10 months to get a baby! what you should do is, develop, develop and keep developing your product!</p>
<p>let me post second part later. keep reading!</p>

<p><a href="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/rsz_2009-05-11_012747.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" title="rsz_2009-05-11_012747" src="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/rsz_2009-05-11_012747.jpg?w=500&#038;h=364" alt="" width="500" height="364" /></a></p>
<p>if we have really smart idea, goof revenue generation model and a good team of technical and management people, then i guess its not that difficult to pitch VC&#8217;s. it seems like most of the tech VC&#8217;s are not interested to fund for consumer oriented services or product line concepts. they just curious and interested in disruptive technologies which can change the present scenario or the way of dealing with people or business.</p>
<p>one of the biggest advantage of US tech VC&#8217;s that i can say is nothing but they are ready to work with really smart ideas and potential people. VC&#8217;s said that we wont expect that people have to come from top notch universities such as Harvard, Standford, MIT or Princeton Universities.  anybody who has great ideas, believe in themselves to execute disruptive technologies and talented team.  honestly, pitching them for funding without enough customer base or revenue is difficult in the early stages of startups. in fact, its very challenging. if the company can generate reasonable revenue over a period of time, then its likely to get funded according to the scope and future opportunities of the web product and services.</p>
<p>I heard from VC&#8217;s like they can invest anywhere from $20k to $5 million for startups. most VC&#8217;s are capable of rising more funds like $10 or $20 million if they really see some great opportunities in the market if the startup have good customer base. to wotk with VC&#8217;s, it is strongly advisable once startups has already kick-off with revenues. basically it increases the chance of winning the game. we can do good negotiation in the later stage!</p>

				<p>By Timothy R. Homan - Oct 7, 2010 8:49 AM ET</p>
<p>Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in three months, indicating companies are slowing the pace of firings.</p>
<p><a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=INJCJC:IND">Jobless claims</a> dropped by 11,000 to 445,000 in the week ended Oct. 2, the fewest since July 10, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. Economists projected 455,000 new claims last week, according to the <a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=INJCJC:IND">median forecast</a> in a Bloomberg News survey. The total number of people receiving unemployment insurance decreased and those getting extended payments jumped.</p>
<p>While dismissals are abating, employers aren’t adding the number of jobs needed to reduce<a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=USURTOT:IND">unemployment</a> that’s close to a 26-year high. A report tomorrow is forecast to show the jobless rate rose for a second month in September, indicating a struggling labor market that may compel the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy.</p>
<p>There is “sluggish improvement,” said Maxwell Clarke, chief U.S. economist at IDEAglobal in New York, who accurately forecast the decline in jobless claims. “Conditions remain for employment to continue to improve.”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.indiadaily.org/images/jobless_youth.jpg" alt="jobless youth" /></p>
<p>Stock-index futures climbed after the report and Treasury securities were little changed. The contract on the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to 1,159.5 at 8:48 a.m. in New York. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note, which moves inversely to prices, fell to 2.39 percent from 2.40 percent late yesterday.</p>
<p>Lower than Projected</p>
<p>Estimates for jobless claims in the Bloomberg survey of 47 economists ranged from 440,000 to 470,000. The Labor Department revised the prior week’s figure to 456,000 from 453,000.</p>
<p>The <a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=INJCJC4:IND">four-week</a> moving average, a less volatile measure than the weekly figures, dropped to 455,750 last week from 458,750, today’s report showed.</p>
<p>The number of people <a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=INJCSP:IND">continuing</a> to receive jobless benefits dropped by 48,000 in the week ended Sept. 25 to 4.46 million, the lowest since June 26.</p>
<p>The continuing claims figure does not include the number of Americans receiving extended and emergency benefits under federal programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now collecting <a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=INJCEUC:IND">emergency</a> and extended payments increased by about 257,000 to 5.14 million in the week ended Sept. 18.</p>
<p>Eligible Jobless</p>
<p>The unemployment <a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=INJCRATE:IND">rate</a> among people eligible for benefits, which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 3.5 percent in the week ended Sept. 25 from 3.6 percent the prior week.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven states and territories reported a decrease in claims, led by a 3,700 decline in New York, where there were fewer staffing reductions in construction and services. Sixteen states reported an increase in the week ended Sept. 25.</p>
<p>Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to fall as job growth &#8212; measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls report &#8212; accelerates.</p>
<p>Private employers in September added 75,000 workers while total payrolls were unchanged, according to a Bloomberg survey before tomorrow’s Labor Department figures. The unemployment rate may have increased to 9.7 percent last month.</p>
<p>The economy is a top issue for voters in the November congressional elections, and polls show the public is increasingly skeptical of President Barack Obama’s performance.</p>
<p>While some companies are still firing employees, others are recalling workers.</p>
<p>American Airlines</p>
<p>American Airlines, the third largest U.S. airline, plans to recall 545 flight attendants and 250 pilots to meet demand for international flights as it begins it begins an alliance with British Airways Plc and Spain’s Iberia.</p>
<p>The first 25 pilots will return to work mid-November and about 30 furloughed pilots will be recalled monthly after that, American, a unit of Fort Worth, Texas-based <a title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=AMR:US">AMR Corp.</a>, said yesterday in a statement. The first recall notices for flight attendants will be issued this month to about 225 workers.</p>

				<p>Flashing Lights in the Sky Prompt Shut Down of Airport in Inner Mongolia!</p>
<p>A Chinese airport was shut down for more than an hour last month because air traffic controllers saw what they believed to be a UFO buzzing the airport, according to reports out of the country.</p>
<p>It is the eighth time since June that UFOs have been reported in China.</p>
<p>In the latest episode, several passenger jets were diverted from the airport at Baotou in Inner Mongolia for about an hour arond 8 p.m. on Sept. 11.</p>
<p>The alert was triggered by bright lights in the sky that moved erratically, but reports claim that air traffic controllers at the Hohhot Air Traffic Management Bureau spotted the object on their radar.</p>
<p><img src="http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ht_UFO_100715_mn.jpg" alt="UFO shuts down Chinese airport" /></p>
<p>After about an hour, the object and the lights suddenly vanished and passenger jets were allowed to land.</p>
<p>The Chinese government had said on previous occasions that the lights claimed to be UFOs were military exercises, but the government denied the Sept. 11 incident happened at all.</p>
<p>This summer another UFO report caused a sensation and forced <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Video/playerIndex?id=2764909" target="external">Xiaoshan Airport</a> in Hangzhou, to cease operations on July 7.</p>
<p>A flight crew preparing for descent first detected the object around 8:40 p.m. and notified the air traffic control department. Aviation authorities responded within minutes, grounding outbound flights and diverting inbound ones to airports in Ningbo and Wuxi.</p>
<div id="storyText">
<div>
<p>Eighteen flights were affected. Though normal operations resumed an hour later, the incident captured the attention of the Chinese media and sparked a firestorm of speculation on the<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=5826502" target="external"> UFO&#8217;s identity</a>.</p>
<p>Hangzhou residents released photos, taken in the afternoon before the delays, of a hovering object bathed in golden light and exhibiting a comet-like tail. Less than an hour before the Xiaoshan airport shut down, residents said they also saw a flying object emitting<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=6078421" target="external"> red and white rays of light</a>.</p>
<h3>Investigating the Phenomenon</h3>
<p>Resident Ma Shijun was taking a nighttime stroll with his wife when he saw the object.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt a beam of light over my head. Looking up, I saw a streak of bright, white light flying across the sky, so I picked up the camera and took the photo. The time was 8:26 p.m. However, whether the object was a plane, or whether it was Xiaoshan Airport&#8217;s UFO, I don&#8217;t have a clear answer,&#8221; Ma told the Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>The photos taken by Hangzhou residents may be unrelated to the UFO that shut down Xiaoshan Airport. According to Hangzhou meteorological authorities, residents in the afternoon probably saw light reflecting off of an airplane. As for Ma&#8217;s nighttime photo, Beijing Planetarium curator Zhu Jing told Xinhua that the object looks just like a plane shining its strobe lamps. A spokesman from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) confirmed to ABC News at the time that the matter was under investigation. He declined to disclose further details.</p>
<p>day after the sighting, however, an anonymous source told China Daily that authorities already discovered the identity of the UFO after<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=6076967" target="external"> an investigation </a>but could not publically disclose the information because &#8220;there was a military connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sightings have also been reported in Xinjiang, Hunan, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces.</p>

				<p>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is a polarizing figure, not just for Microsoft investors but also for the company&#8217;s employees.</p>
<p>An  ongoing survey of more than 1,000 Microsoft employees conducted by  Glassdoor.com currently shows that only 51% of Ballmer&#8217;s staff approve  of his performance as CEO.</p>
<p><a href="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/steve-ballmer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-499" title="steve-ballmer" src="http://gskarthikeyan.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/steve-ballmer.jpg?w=460&#038;h=276" alt="" width="460" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s telling, considering that Microsoft (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT&amp;source=story_quote_link">MSFT</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/3063.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>) employees said they love the company itself. Microsoft ranked No. 51 on Fortune&#8217;s list of the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2010/index.html">100 Best Companies to Work For</a>,  and the software giant&#8217;s work force gave the company an average  satisfaction score of 3.5 out of 5 in Glassdoor&#8217;s poll. That&#8217;s  significantly higher than the ratings of other tech giants like  Hewlett-Packard (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=HPQ&amp;source=story_quote_link">HPQ</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/206.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>), IBM (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=IBM&amp;source=story_quote_link">IBM</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/225.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>), Oracle (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=ORCL&amp;source=story_quote_link">ORCL</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/3057.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>), Dell (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DELL&amp;source=story_quote_link">DELL</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/1053.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>) and Cisco Systems (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CSCO&amp;source=story_quote_link">CSCO</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/5009.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>) and only slightly lower than the 3.8 rating employees gave to both Apple (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link">AAPL</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/670.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>) and Google (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GOOG&amp;source=story_quote_link">GOOG</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2010/snapshots/11207.html?source=story_f500_link">Fortune 500</a>).</p>
<p>But as the head of the company, Ballmer hasn&#8217;t been able to find the same kind of love and admiration.</p>
<p>Some  on Wall Street have been calling for his head for years. Since Ballmer  took the reins as CEO from Bill Gates in 2000, Microsoft&#8217;s stock has  been nearly cut in half. Despite this year&#8217;s strong financial  performance and impressive sales of Windows 7, Office 2010 and cloud  products for corporate customers, Microsoft&#8217;s stock has gotten hammered,  falling 20%.</p>
<p>Things haven&#8217;t gotten any better for the embattled  CEO lately. Microsoft revealed in a regulatory filing on Friday that  Ballmer would get only half of his potential bonus this year, because of  consumer product failures. The board cited &#8220;the unsuccessful launch of  the Kin phone, loss of market share in the company&#8217;s mobile phone  business, and the need for the company to pursue innovations to take  advantage of new form factors.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last bit about &#8220;form factors&#8221; is jargon for &#8220;<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/07/29/technology/microsoft_analyst_meeting/index.htm">where&#8217;s our tablet</a>!?&#8221;</p>
<p>A  make-or-break moment could be looming for Ballmer. On Oct. 11,  Microsoft will hold an event in New York at which it will unveil its new  mobile platform, Windows Phone 7, to the public. The company is  expected to also discuss its tablet strategy.</p>
<p>Success in those two arenas &#8212; smartphones and tablets &#8212; will be if Microsoft is to maintain its dominance in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;This  is a pretty critical moment for Microsoft, particularly as we see a  shift to people wanting access to the information they need from any  device,&#8221; said Rebecca Wettemann, analyst at Nucleus Research. &#8220;The  winner in this space will be the one that puts a toy in the consumer&#8217;s  hands that is also a good business tool for a worker&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple  and Google have already taken early leads in mobile, and Apple&#8217;s iPad  essentially recreated the tablet category of devices, leaving Microsoft  desperately trying to catch up.</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn&#8217;t been able to get  any traction in the mobile market with its smartphone platform. In fact,  the forecast for Windows Mobile&#8217;s future was so ugly that Microsoft  scrapped the platform entirely and started from scratch with Windows  Phone 7.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ballmer famously killed off the tablet device  that Microsoft had been working on for years before the release of the  iPad. He opted instead to let device manufacturers create tablets that  can run Microsoft&#8217;s desktop operating system, Windows 7.</p>
<p>Even with these struggles, Ballmer&#8217;s job seems safe in the near term. Analysts give him credit for the company&#8217;s <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/06/14/technology/microsoft_future/index.htm">strong financial performance</a>, and for turning Microsoft around after the Windows Vista debacle.</p>
<p>&#8220;In  the mobile and tablet market place, clearly Microsoft is late, but  we&#8217;re still early in the game,&#8221; said Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC  partners. &#8220;There&#8217;s no make-or-break moment. I liken it to a wedding: The  wedding is a day, but a marriage is a lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>But others think  that Ballmer&#8217;s failure to get Microsoft ahead on the devices that will  matter most for the future is egregious enough to get Microsoft&#8217;s board  thinking about someone else for the position.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Oracle CEO] Larry  [Ellison] has Fusion and [Apple CEO Steve] Jobs has the iPad, but  Microsoft has had things in development for a while without being able  to get those things to market,&#8221; Wettemann said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of  thing that sparks a leadership change.&#8221;</p>
