 No.1 reactor is in a "meltdown" state<br><br>Tokyo Electric Power Company says the No.1 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is believed to be in a state of "meltdown".<br><br>The utility company said on Thursday that most of the fuel rods are likely to have melted and fallen to the bottom of the reactor. Earlier in the day, it found that the coolant water in the reactor is at a level which would completely expose nuclear fuel rods if they were in their normal position.<br><br>The company believes the melted fuel has cooled down, judging from the reactor's surface temperature.<br><A HREF="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/13_03.html">NEWS here</A><br><br><br>

 (NaturalNews) According to a report by the Organic Consumers Association, a toxic chemical that is a byproduct of rocket fuel is rapidly poisoning the food and water supply in the United States. Known as perchlorate, this chemical has been found in 93% of the nation's milk and lettuce supply in a recent FDA study. It has also been found in the drinking water for at least 22 states at extremely alarming levels. Perhaps the scariest statistic is that perchlorate has been found in the breast milk of 97% of the mothers who were tested.<br><br>According to a website by Laura Power, MS, PhD, LDN, perchlorate is a toxin that interferes with thyroid function by supplanting iodine in the body, causing harm to iodine transporters. This can be responsible for numerous health problems, notes Dr. Power, including "hypothyroidism, thyroid cancer, goiter, breast disease, disruption of the menstrual cycle, immune system dysfunction, poor fetal development, and mental retardation of newborns." <br><br>According to Dr. Power, there are many other symptoms of hypothyroidism such as brittle nails, poor memory, constipation, menstrual irregularities, high cholesterol, poor concentration, irritability, dry skin, dry hair, hair loss and more. Imagine how frustrating it might be for a woman who is drinking lots of water and eating lots of healthy salads but isn't making any progress losing weight due to thyroid disease caused by perchlorate ingestion.<br><A HREF="http://www.naturalnews.com/z024071.html">Read full article here</A>

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Roundworms may infect close to a quarter of inner city black children, tapeworms are the leading cause of seizures among U.S. Hispanics and other parasitic diseases associated with poor countries are also affecting Americans, a U.S. expert said on Tuesday.<br>He noted a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, presented in November, found that almost 14 percent of the U.S. population is infected with Toxocara roundworms, which dogs and cats can pass to people.<br>"Urban playgrounds in the United States have recently been shown to be a particularly rich source of Toxocara eggs and inner-city children are at high risk of acquiring the infection," Hotez wrote, adding that this might be partly behind the rise in asthma cases in the country. Up to 23 percent of urban black children may be infected, he said.<br>"Because of its possible links to asthma, it would be important to determine whether covert toxocariasis is a basis for the rise of asthma among inner-city children in the northeastern United States," he added.<br>"Cysticercosis is another very serious parasitic worm infection ... caused by the tapeworm Taenia solium, that results in seizures and other neurological manifestations," Hotez wrote.<br>He said up to 2,000 new cases of neurological disease caused by tapeworms are diagnosed every year in the United States. More than 2 percent of adult Latinos may be infected, and with 35 million Hispanics in the United States, this could add up to tens of thousands of cases, Hotez said.<br><A HREF="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN2526656920071226?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews&rpc=22&sp=true">Full article here</A>

 By Byron J. Richards, CCN<br>June 27, 2007<br>NewsWithViews.com<br><br>The FDA, emboldened by its transformation into a drug company, has embarked upon an anti-American plan of interfering with business and intentionally eliminating various dietary supplement companies from the market. The FDA announcement came on Friday, June 22, 2007 under the guise of a final rule for dietary supplement good manufacturing practices (CGMPs). Within this 800 page rule the FDA states, �We find that this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.... <br><A HREF="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr07625a.html">Actual 800 page ruling!</A><br><br>Establishments with above average costs, and even establishments with average costs, could be hard pressed to continue to operate. Some of these may decide it is too costly and either change product lines or go out of business.... 140 very small [less than 20 employees] and 32 small dietary supplement manufacturers [less than 500 employees] will be at risk of going out of business.... costs per establishment are proportionally higher for very small than for large establishments....The regulatory costs of this final rule will also discourage new small businesses from entering the industry.� <br><br>This FDA rule will directly raise the price of dietary supplements for all consumers. The FDA acknowledges this and says �We expect that the majority of these costs will be borne by consumers of dietary supplements, who will likely respond to the increase in prices by reducing consumption.� Thus, the FDA is intentionally seeking to shrink the size of the dietary supplement industry and reduce the influence of safe and effective options to improve the dreadful trend in the health of Americans. The goal is to leave toxic drugs as the primary health option. <br><A HREF="http://www.newswithviews.com/Richards/byron36.htm">Full article here</A><br><br>

 Flaxseed, a high-fiber and omega 3-fatty acid-rich compound, appears to halt the formation of prostate tumors, according to a study led by Duke University Medical Center researchers. The seed, which is similar to a sesame seed and belongs to a group of compounds called lignans, may be able to interrupt events that lead cells to divide irregularly and become cancerous, concluded the study.<br><br>The results showed that the men who took just flaxseed as well as those who took flaxseed combined with a low-fat diet did the best, indicating that it is the flaxseed which is making the difference,� Demark-Wahnefried said.<br><br>Researchers believe that, as a source of omega 3-fatty acids, flaxseed can alter how cancer cells lump together or cling to other body cells, which are factors in how fast cancer cells proliferate, Demark-Wahnefried said.

 One of the indications that vaccinations may in fact be changing the genetic structure of humans became evident in September of 1971, when scientists at the University of Geneva made the discovery that biological substances entering directly into the bloodstream could become part of human genetic structure. Originally, Japanese bacteriologists discovered that  bacteria  of one species transferred their own specific antibiotic resistance to bacteria of an entirely different species. Dr. Maurice Stroun and Dr. Philip Anker in the Department of Plant Physiology at the University of Geneva, began to accumulate evidence that the transfer of genetic information is not confined to bacteria, but can also occur between bacteria and higher plants and animals.<br><A HREF="http://www.homestead.com/vonhapsburg/vaccinesalterdna.html">Full article here</A><br>

The experimental diet began two weeks before the rats conceived and continued through pregnancy and nursing.<br>   But the real shock came when the rats started dying. Within three weeks, 25 of the 45 (55.6%) rats from the GM soy group died compared to only 3 of 33 (9%) from the non-GM soy group and 3 of 44 (6.8%) from the non-soy controls<br>   The soy she was testing was Monsanto�s Roundup Ready variety. Its DNA has bacterial genes added that allow the soy plant to survive applications of Monsanto�s �Roundup� brand herbicide. About 85% of the soy gown in the US is Roundup Ready. Since soy derivatives, including oil, flour and lecithin, are found in the majority of processed foods sold in the US, many Americans eat ingredients derived from Roundup Ready soy everyday.<br><A HREF="http://www.seedsofdeception.com/utility/showArticle/?objectID=297">Full article here</A><br>Marijah's note:  Seeds of Deception website is a wellspring of information, so take some time and read up on GM foods.

 WASHINGTON (AP) -- A mix of bacteria-killing viruses can be safely sprayed on cold cuts, hot dogs and sausages to combat common microbes that kill hundreds of people a year, federal health officials said Friday in granting the first-ever approval of viruses as a food additive. <br>    Consumers won't be aware that meat and poultry products have been treated with the spray, Zajac added. The Department of Agriculture will regulate the actual use of the product. <br>    The viruses are grown in a preparation of the very bacteria they kill, and then purified. The FDA had concerns that the virus preparation potentially could contain toxic residues associated with the bacteria. However, testing did not reveal the presence of such residues, which in small quantities likely wouldn't cause health problems anyway, the FDA said.<br><A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general73/fdfd.htm">Full article here</A>

 A CHEMICAL used to make food wrapping and line tin cans could be the cause of surging prostate cancer rates in men, says a study. Bisphenol A is widely used in the food industry to make polycarbonate drinks bottles and the resins used to line tin cans, even though it is known to leach into food and has long been suspected of disrupting human sex hormones.  The new research suggests the small but constant level of bisphenol A entering people�s diet has a particular impact on pregnant women, disastrously altering the development of unborn baby sons. <br><br>The chemical causes microscopic changes in the developing prostate gland but these are not apparent at birth. Instead, they show up years later when they lead to a range of prostate diseases, such as enlargement and cancer. The changes can also cause malformation of the urethra, the channel for urine. <br><A HREF="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C8122-1596301%2C00.html">Full article here</A><br><br>

One was a genetically engineered poxvirus, (vaccinia virus (VIC) with a transgene from the influenza virus). The other was a naturally occurring relative of the first virus, isolated from Norwegian wildlife. Both were orthopoxviruses. The two viruses interacted and created many new hybrid viruses by recombination. The characteristics of some of the new viruses included traits not expressed in either parent virus. Some viruses, for example, spread faster than either parent, while others produced different, more serious cell culture changes. A single virus multiplied into hundreds of thousands of viruses in a few hours, with unpredictable consequences. Since the marker gene in the transgenic virus was not present in some of the newly formed hybrid viruses, it would not be possible to track transgenic viruses as the origin of the hybrids, if they were found in the wild.<br><A HREF="http://www.seedsofdeception.com/utility/showArticle/?objectID=39">Article here</A><br><br><br>

  <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><strong>Study Finds Low-Fat Diet Won't Stop Cancer or Heart Disease </strong><br>
 February 7, 2006 <br>The largest study ever to ask whether a low-fat diet reduces the risk of getting cancer or heart disease has found that the diet has no effect.  The $415 million federal study involved nearly 49,000 women ages 50 to 79 who were followed for eight years. In the end, those assigned to a low-fat diet had the same rates of breast cancer, colon cancer, heart attacks and strokes as those who ate whatever they pleased, researchers are reporting today. <br><br>"These studies are revolutionary," said Dr. Jules Hirsch, physician in chief emeritus at Rockefeller University in New York City, who has spent a lifetime studying the effects of diets on weight and health. "They should put a stop to this era of thinking that we have all the information we need to change the whole national diet and make everybody healthy." <br><br>The study, published in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, was not just an ordinary study, said Dr. Michael Thun, who directs epidemiological research for the American Cancer Society. It was so large and so expensive, Dr. Thun said, that it was "the Rolls-Royce of studies." As such, he added, it is likely to be the final word. "We usually have only one shot at a very large-scale trial on a particular issue," he said. <br><br>The results, the study investigators agreed, do not justify recommending low-fat diets to the public to reduce their heart disease and cancer risk. Given the lack of benefit found in the study, many medical researchers said that the best dietary advice, for now, was to follow federal guidelines for healthy eating, with less saturated and trans fats, more grains, and more fruits and vegetables.

 Jan 10th, 2006 - Today in Italy - Special service by AGI on behalf of the Italian Prime Minister's office<br>  <br>BIRD FLU: H5N1 SAME VIRUS AS SPANISH FLU (50 MLN DEATHS)<br>(AGI) - Rome, Jan. 9 - Spanish flu, which in 1918 killed 50 million people, was caused by a bird flu virus, which evolved and passed from birds to humans. Today's H5N1 is a variant of the same virus and "is the worst ever seen and the most likely candidate to cause the next pandemic", declared in an interview published by "Le Scienze", the virologist, R. G. Webster, who is the biggest world expert in flu epidemics. A bird flu virus, H2N2 causing Asian flu in 1957, and H3N2 causing Hong Kong flu 1968 (both with 1 - 4 million deaths) and again H1N1 in Russia in 1977: in all these cases the virus spread among animals and then transmuted and was spread from man to man. The current virus has not yet spread man to man, but the WHO fears that it could mutate from one moment to the next. H5N1 is fatal for bird in 100 pct of cases, in just 48 hours. It has also hit other mammals, even tigers and leopards and then has spread among man in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia and is showing worrying signs in Turkey. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has already sent a "pandemic alert" to all governments worldwide a few months back, which indicated what to do to prepare for a pandemic. <br><A HREF="http://www.agi.it/english/news.pl?doc=200601091808-1180-RT1-CRO-0-NF11&page=0&id=agionline-eng.oggitalia">Not sure how long this link will work as this is an Italian site</A>

  <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><strong>Vitamin D - UK Research Says Can Prevent Cancer!</strong><br>
 The Pill That Prevents Cancer <br>By Jeremy Laurance, Health Editor  - Published: 28 December 2005<br> <br>   A daily dose of vitamin D could cut the risk of cancers of the breast, colon and ovary by up to a half, a 40-year review of research has found. The evidence for the protective effect of the "sunshine vitamin" is so overwhelming that urgent action must be taken by public health authorities to boost blood levels, say cancer specialists. <br><br>   A growing body of evidence in recent years has shown that lack of vitamin D may have lethal effects. Heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis are among the conditions in which it is believed to play a vital role. The vitamin is also essential for bone health and protects against rickets in children and osteoporosis in the elderly. <br><br>   Vitamin D is made by the action of sunlight on the skin, which accounts for 90 per cent of the body's supply. But the increasing use of sunscreens and the reduced time spent outdoors, especially by children, has contributed to what many scientists believe is an increasing problem of vitamin D deficiency. <br><br>   After assessing almost every scientific paper published on the link between vitamin D and cancer since the 1960s, US scientists say that a daily dose of 1,000 international units (25 micrograms) is needed to maintain health. " The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency combined with the discovery of increased risks of certain types of cancer in those who are deficient, suggest that vitamin D deficiency may account for several thousand premature deaths from colon, breast, ovarian and other cancers annually," they say in the online version of the American Journal of Public Health. <br><br>   The dose they propose of 1,000IU a day is two-and-a-half times the current recommended level in the US. In the UK, there is no official recommended dose but grey skies and short days from October to March mean 60 per cent of the population has inadequate blood levels by the end of winter. <br><br>   The UK Food Standards Agency maintains that most people should be able to get all the vitamin D they need from their diet and "by getting a little sun". But the vitamin can only be stored in the body for 60 days. <br><br>   High rates of heart disease in Scotland have been blamed on the weak sunlight and short summers in the north, leading to low levels of vitamin D. Differences in sunlight may also explain the higher rates of heart disease in England compared with southern Europe. Some experts believe the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet may have as much to do with the sun there as with the regional food. <br>   <br>In the latest study, cancer specialists from the University of San Diego, California, led by Professor Cedric Garland, reviewed 63 scientific papers on the link between vitamin D and cancer published between 1966 and 2004. People living in the north-eastern US, where it is less sunny, and African Americans with darker skins were more likely to be deficient, researchers found. They also had higher cancer rates. <br><br>   The researchers say their finding could explain why black Americans die sooner from cancer than whites, even after allowing for differences in income and access to care. <br><br>   Professor Garland said: "A preponderance of evidence from the best observational studies... has led to the conclusion that public health action is needed. Primary prevention of these cancers has been largely neglected, but we now have proof that the incidence of colon, breast and ovarian cancer can be reduced dramatically by increasing the public's intake of vitamin D." Obtaining the necessary level of vitamin D from diet alone would be difficult and sun exposure carries a risk of triggering skin cancer. "The easiest and most reliable way of getting the appropriate amount is from food and a daily supplement," they say. The UK Food Standards Agency said that taking Vitamin D supplements of up to 1,000IU was " unlikely to cause harm". <br><br>WHAT IT CAN DO <br>Heart disease - Vitamin D works by lowering insulin resistance, which is one of the major factors leading to heart disease. <br><br>Lung disease - Lung tissue undergoes repair and "remodelling" in life and, since vitamin D influences the growth of a variety of cell types, it may play a role in this lung repair process. <br><br>Cancers (breast, colon, ovary, prostate) - Vitamin D is believed to play an important role in regulating the production of cells, a control that is missing in cancer. It has a protective effect against certain cancers by preventing overproduction of cells. <br><br>Diabetes - In type 1 diabetes the immune system destroys its own cells. Vitamin D is believed to act as an immunosuppressant. Researchers believe it may prevent an overly aggressive response from the immune system. <br><br>High blood pressure - Vitamin D is used by the parathyroid glands that sit on the thyroid gland in the neck. These secrete a hormone that regulates the body's calcium levels. Calcium, in turn, helps to regulate blood pressure, although the mechanism is not yet completely understood. <br><br>Schizophrenia - The chance of developing schizophrenia could be linked to how sunny it was in the months before birth. A lack of sunlight can lead to vitamin D deficiency, which scientists believe could alter the growth of a child's brain in the womb. <br><br>Multiple sclerosis - Lack of vitamin D leads to limited production of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the hormonal form of vitamin D3 which regulates the immune system, creating a risk for MS. <br><br>Rickets and osteoporosis - The vitamin strengthens bones, protecting against childhood rickets and osteoporosis in the elderly. <br><A HREF="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article335359.ece">Click here article</A><br><br>HHA Vitamin A & D - only $5.00 per bottle when you buy 3!!!<br>Ingredients: Vitamin A - 25,000 IU - Vitamin D - 1000 IU, Fish Liver Oil 50 mg.<br><A HREF="http://www.herbalhealer.com/monthly.html">Scroll down to the Vitamin A & D to order</A><br><br> <br>

 Scientists have begun mixing human genes with rice in an attempt to take genetically modified crops to the next level.

They hope the enzyme, CYP2B6, will do the same to herbicides and pollutants when combined with rice. <br><A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general64/gmfe.htm">Click here to see the whole article</A>

Cervical cancer strikes nearly half a million women worldwide each year and kills about half. In the United States, about 15,000 women get it and about 5,000 die. Virtually all cases are caused by infection with human papilloma virus, or HPV, which is spread through sex. One strain, HPV-16, accounts for about half of all cervical cancers.

The changes -- which would allow the use of antibiotics on organic dairy cows, as well as synthetic pesticides on organic farms, and more -- were made with zero input from the public or the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), the advisory group that worked for more than a decade to help craft the first federal organic standards, put in place in October 2002...<br><A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general53/bsush.htm">Click here to read the article.</A><br><br>UPDATE!!!!

 Purdue University researchers surveyed 83 owners of Scottish terriers whose pets had recently been diagnosed with bladder cancer for their report, published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medicine Association. "The risk ... was found to be between four and seven times more likely in exposed animals," said Larry Glickman, professor of epidemiology and environmental medicine in Purdue's School of Veterinary Medicine. "While we hope to determine which of the many chemicals in lawn treatments are responsible, we also hope the similarity between human and dog genomes will allow us to find the genetic predisposition toward this form of cancer found in both Scotties and certain people." ...<br><A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general52/lnn.htm">Click here to read the article.</A><br><br>  <br>

The finding comes just days after it was revealed the same chemical, allicin, could treat the hospital superbug MRSA (See next article down).  The cancer treatment harnesses the natural chemical reaction in which allicin is produced. The journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics details how the reaction can be triggered at tumour sites. <br><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3356737.stm">Click here to read the article.</A><br>Also look on the right side of the page...

 The ingredient which gives garlic its distinctive smell is the latest weapon in the battle to beat the hospital "superbug" MRSA. <br>University of East London researchers found allicin treated even the most antibiotic-resistant strains of the infection.  MRSA (Methecillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) causes an estimated 2,000 deaths in UK hospitals each year.  Researchers are now testing allicin products in a six-month study. Dr Ron Cutler and his team discovered the effectiveness of allicin in laboratory tests five years ago. They found it can cure MRSA within weeks.  It is even effective against the newer strains which cannot be treated by the "last line of defence" antibiotics Vancomycin and Glycopeptides. <br><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3344325.stm">Click here to read the article.</A>

 Glaxo chief: Our drugs do not work on most patients <br><br>A senior executive with Britain's biggest drugs company has admitted that most prescription medicines do not work on most people who take them.

His comments come days after it emerged that the NHS drugs bill has soared by nearly 50 per cent in three years, rising by �2.3bn a year to an annual cost to the taxpayer of �7.2bn. GSK announced last week that it had 20 or more new drugs under development that could each earn the company up to $1bn (�600m) a year.<br><br>Drugs for Alzheimer's disease work in fewer than one in three patients, whereas those for cancer are only effective in a quarter of patients. Drugs for migraines, for osteoporosis, and arthritis work in about half the patients, Dr Roses said. Most drugs work in fewer than one in two patients mainly because the recipients carry genes that interfere in some way with the medicine, he said.<br><br>"The vast majority of drugs - more than 90 per cent - only work in 30 or 50 per cent of the people," Dr Roses said.

''This is very serious,'' said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 US Army scientists create "Spanish Flu" virus in laboratory - medical benefit questionable. (Now that's an understatement!)<br><br>(Austin and Hamburg, 9 October 2003) � The 'Spanish Flu' influenza virus that killed 20-40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction. Several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains. These proved to be lethal for mice, while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect. These experiments may easily be abused for military purposes, but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view.<br><br>The 1918 Spanish Flu was highly infectious and � in comparison to contemporary flu viruses � killed a very high percentage of those infected, including many younger people. The Spanish Flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the US in 1918 to drop by 10 years. Hence, flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat. Just two weeks ago, a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the US to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses. <br><br>Despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus, efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s, when Dr Jeffrey Taubenberger from the US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington DC succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral RNA from preserved tissues of 1918 victims. In the current issue of the scientific journal Emerging Infectious Diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published...<br><A HREF="http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/pr/pr091003.html">Click here to read the article.</A><br><br>RECREATING THE SPANISH FLU<br><A HREF="http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/others/gmoflu.html">Click here to read more.</A><br>

 This is sickening and is a real enfringement on YOUR rights to CHOOSE what products you want for your family.<br><br>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Monday warned about 40 Web sites to immediately stop marketing unproven treatments for anthrax or other products they falsely claim can protect against potential biowarfare agents. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said the Internet site operators could face prosecution if they continue promoting the products. The action is part of a federal effort to crack down on Internet sites that aim to capitalize off Americans' worries about bioterrorism with bogus products. The FTC said the warnings, sent via e-mail, went to Web sites that promoted things such as oregano oil and zinc mineral water as home remedies for anthrax or other illnesses that could result from a biological attack.<br>The FTC is aware of no scientific basis for any of the self-treatment alternatives being marketed on the Internet,'' Harold Beales, the FTC's director for consumer protection, said in a statement. Operators of Web sites that continue to market products after being warned may face prosecution, the agency said. Civil fines can range as high as $11,000 per violation. Since the investigation into these sites is ongoing, an FTC spokesman refused to reveal the names of the Web sites in question.<br>Note: Link to article was pulled from the news web site.<br><br><br><br>

They can move forward a step or backward a step. Nothing more. They can't reach back to bite at an itch. They can't drop their heads into the normal posture of sleep. They can't lie down and have a really good roll - something horses love to do occasionally... <br>  <A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general16/estro.htm">Click here to read article</A>

 Hey, Anthrax has not gone away.  The Govenment has classified Anthrax information, that is why it is not on the news.  Look at the numbers!<br><br>In the most stunning picture yet of how far anthrax has reached, the CDC disclosed that 32,000 Americans have taken antibiotics for at least several days while scientists raced to tell who was truly exposed to the germs. Of them, 5,000 were found at risk for anthrax infection and told to take antibiotics for a full 60 days. <br><br>The guidelines aim to limit the number of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. People need protective antibiotics if there is evidence they were in ``a breathing zone'' of anthrax, Gerberding said - such as a postal facility known to have processed a tainted letter or a building where someone caught inhaled anthrax.

 LONDON (Nov. 1) - Ensuring babies and young children get enough vitamin D can reduce their risk of developing diabetes, scientists said Friday. Type 1 diabetes, which starts at an early age, has been associated with a deficiency of vitamin D, the so-called sunshine vitamin, which is also found in fortified milk and dairy products, cod liver oil and some fatty fish. When Dr. Elina Hypponen, of the Institute of Child Health in London, and her colleagues in Finland compared the health of more than 12,000 children they found that the youngsters who had been given vitamin D supplements were 80 percent less likely to develop diabetes than children not given the vitamin. <br>The recommended daily dose of vitamin D for children is 400 international units, or 10 micrograms, per day. Researchers warned that very high doses could be toxic and, in the most severe cases, deadly.

  <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><strong>The History Of Germ Warfare - Very Long, Very Deadly</strong><br>
 The United States, Great Britain and other countries developed anthrax weapons during World War II. The British military in 1942 began testing "anthrax bombs" on Gruinard Island, a 500-acre dot of land off the northwestern coast of Scotland. After the war, the project was abandoned. However, the Gruinard experiments established the terrible environmental consequences of using anthrax as a weapon of mass destruction. <br>  British scientists thought the anthrax spores would quickly die or blow away into the ocean. But the spores lived on. Huge numbers remained infectious year after year. Finally, in 1986, after critics labeled Gruinard "Anthrax Island," the British government decided to clean up the mess. Workers built an irrigation system over the entire test range. It saturated the ground with 280 tons of formaldehyde -"embalming fluid" -diluted in 2,000 tons of seawater. The fluid flowed 24 hours a day for more than a year. Gruinard finally was declared decontaminated in 1990. It remains uninhabited today. <br><A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general16/thehistoryofgerm.htm">Click here to read article</A>

Terminator has been universally opposed as an immoral technology because over 1.4 billion people, primarily poor farmers, depend on farm-saved seeds as their primary seed source. <br><A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general12/terminator.htm">Click here to read entire article.</A>

 London, England - The Department of Health has told doctors they must use stocks of a mercury-based vaccine for infants even though it is being phased out for safety reasons. The department is supplying the brand with mercury despite fears that it could be a cause of autism and other disorders. The decision flies in the face of European guidelines, which warn that it would be prudent to avoid such vaccines for children. Last month all GPs and clinics, which inoculate more than 600,000 babies a year, were told all orders for the combined diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) and Hib vaccine (which protects against a form of meningitis) would be met with a product containing thiomersal, which is almost 50% mercury. This was "in order to make good use of the current and future stocks available". <br><A HREF="http://www.rense.com/general12/babies.htm">Click here to read entire article.</A><br>

So now we get tv ads with soft-focused shots of poor children and a heart-tugging message that says we must support bio-engineered foods or Third World kids will go blind.<br>But, wait - scientists are now pointing out that Golden Rice's humanitarian pitch is a cynical corporate ruse.

The president planned to announce that he is calling on the federal nutrition program known as WIC (women, infants and children) to check the immunization status of every child receiving services and assistance. He wants the program to refer children who are behind on their immunizations to a local doctor or public clinic.

 Monday, Dec 11.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just in time for the holiday season, a corporate-funded study published Monday said an antidepressant can help compulsive shoppers. People with the disorder who took the drug -- a member of the newest class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors -- showed marked improvement in their condition, said Dr. Kim Bullock and colleagues at Stanford University in California.  They tested 21 patients, who took the drug citalopram, made by Forest Laboratories Inc. under the name Celexa, for three months. "Compulsive shopping (or compulsive buying) is a disorder characterized by a preoccupation with purchasing unneeded items that causes marked distress, social or occupational impairment and/or financial problems," the researchers said in a statement. It affects between 2 percent and 8 percent of the U.S. population, they said. Most people suffering from the disorder are women. The drug is sold in 70 countries under several trade names including Celexa, Cipramil and Seropram. Forest Laboratories funded the study. (They don't mention the fact that their subliminal aggressive advertising is the number one contributing factor to compulsive shopping.  Compulsive shopping, now a mental disorder??? People these drug lords are out of control!!!)<br><br>

     WASHINGTON (AP) - A popular new prescription treatment for women suffering irritable bowel syndrome is being pulled off the market amid growing reports linking it to severe intestinal side effects, including some deaths. <br>    Manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome Inc. withdrew Lotronex on Tuesday, just nine months after it began selling the drug with great fanfare. It becomes the seventh banned drug the increasingly embattled Food and Drug Administration has had to deal with in 2 1/2 years. <br>The problem: Lotronex can cause serious side effects, including a life-threatening intestinal inflammation called ischemic colitis, and constipation so severe that some patients needed parts of their intestines surgically removed. <br>    A review of FDA's records by The Associated Press indicates the agency knows of at least eight women who died with intestinal side effects while taking Lotronex. The agency also says at least 70 additional cases of ischemic colitis or severe constipation probably were caused by Lotronex. Two-thirds of those women needed hospitalization. <br>    Manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome Inc. contends Lotronex is safe when used by the right patient, and calls it no more risky than some other big-selling medicines. (Oh boy, that's comforting Glaxo!) But, saying it was under orders from FDA, the company announced Tuesday that it would cease distribution of Lotronex immediately and recall the drug from pharmacies. About 150,000 people use Lotronex, and those with supplies remaining can contact Glaxo about a refund at 1-888-825-5249. <br>
