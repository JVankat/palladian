	<div class="entry clearfloat">
	
	<p>I&#8217;ve taken sometime to separate my self from the game -due to the fact that I didn&#8217;t want to write anything in haste. I sympathize with both teams this year. I understand what it feels like watching the home team fans rush the field in victory and I completely understand the frustration and disappointment of losing &#8220;the game&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get the post game wrap-up  posted soon, but here are a few thoughts I&#8217;ve had as I have read through the comments after the game.</p>
<p><span id="more-2296"></span>Coaching &#8211; Both coaching staffs worked extremely hard in order help their teams win. BYU had a few new wrinkles installed during the week, but they weren&#8217;t enough to swing the games emotional momentum completely to the Cougars side.</p>
<p>The Utes also threw in some new defensive looks, which they executed at the right time to get turnovers. Utah also did a good job of sticking to their game plan and exploiting our defensive weaknesses in order to capitalize on turnovers throughout the game.</p>
<p>Coach Anae doesn&#8217;t need to be in the box because he has Doman and Reynalds up there spotting everything that he is missing on the field.</p>
<p>Max &#8211; Remember that post about emotion and not letting  your emotions run over, but controlling your emotions through a channel that would allow for a players best individual performance. Max didn&#8217;t read that one. He simply couldn&#8217;t recover from his second interception when Dennis read the defense one  way, Max read it a different way and hit the Utah defender right between the numbers. Then after the initial bad decision, he let Utah&#8217;s defense get to him and retaliated in an immature manner, which cost our team dearly headed into the half.</p>
<p>Max isn&#8217;t a bad player or a head case, but he is extremely competitive and when things didn&#8217;t go BYU&#8217;s way he couldn&#8217;t recover.</p>
<p>There were lots of mistakes made on the field Saturday night. Max&#8217;s just happened to be the most visible and obvious, but he chose to play quarterback and that position comes with a lot of glory -unless you were responsible for 6 turnovers and then it comes with a lot a crap-o-la that no one wants.</p>
<p>The Defense &#8211; I am going to save this one for another post.</p>
<p>The Rest of the offense &#8211; will also be addressed in another post.</p>

						<p>I thought our offense overall did well.  Anae should have run more as the yewts seemed to be dropping back a lot and guys weren&#8217;t open.  This could have helped alleviate a little of the pressure.</p>

						<p>Great take Quinn.  I agree, it seemed like Max was just a bit too impatient, pressing things, too fired up.</p>
<p>I love the guy, he&#8217;s my guy, and he&#8217;ll stay that way, but he didn&#8217;t have a good game, and we needed him to have a good game to win.</p>
<p>I also agree that it was clear that the Utes were pulling out all the stops to stop the pass and betting that we wouldn&#8217;t be patient enough to just run it down their throats all night.  They guessed right.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>

						<p>Excellent post, I was wondering what happened in that second interception, because there wasn&#8217;t a cougar in the area.</p>
<p>Hall played phenomenally most of the year, hopefully he takes a note out of John Beck&#8217;s book and brainstorms on solutions for the few problems he had this year.</p>

			<cite><strong>CougB  </strong> said: </cite>

						<p>Thanks, Quinn for your great posting and perspective. This one hurt, but I and most fans will survive. If the team can follow the leadership shown by Max Hall and Coach Mendenhall shown in their post-game comments, they will survive and prosper as well.</p>
<p>A lot of ifs available. If the defense is able to adjust earlier in the game to slow Utah, BYU gets a lead. With a lead, BYU balances their offense more using the running game and Utah either doesn&#8217;t use some of their trick defensive plays or gets burned by them. Therefore, fewer turnovers, and BYU probably takes control of the game.</p>
<p>Congrats to Utah, though. They kept the pressure on and prepared plays to take advantage of it. I expect the BYU program to grow from the experience and move forward. </p>
<p>Good job by Anae on preparing the offense with effective plays. Good job by Hill and Mendenhall  in adjusting with injury depleted LBs and secondary to close-down Utah&#8217;s base offense and give BYU a chance in mid-game. Great job by the players who stepped up when needed. Too bad about the outcome, but none of them should hang their heads, just learn and get better.</p>

						<p>I have a hard time blaming Anae when a single player was responsible fully or partially for 6 turnovers.  Not sure how you gameplan for that, expecially when he&#8217;s been your best most consistent player all year.  Hall passing the ball this year has been about as stable (not turning it over) as our running backs have been.  </p>
<p>Maybe a couple of those turnovers were Anae&#8217;s fault, but not all 6.  With only 4 turnovers  this game would have been much closer.</p>

						<p>Quinn,</p>
<p>What do you think of Max&#8217;s comments in the locker room that it was &#8220;just another game&#8221;? I know that as a fan I don&#8217;t really understand anything, but shouldn&#8217;t he be a little more upset about the game? Thanks for your posts!!</p>

			<cite><strong>hey gooch  </strong> said: </cite>

						<p>I agree with CougB. I think the team played their best game of the year (excluding Max).  The defense played solid after the first quarter: linebackers were great, safeties played well (Gooch&#8211;you have to love Andrew Rich, he had the best hit of the game).  The offense was solid, no sacks , the recievers played great, and running backs averaged 7.7 vs. the &#8216;vaunted&#8217; ute defense. THis was the best team performance of the year by far; however, no team can overcome 6 turnovers by the quarterback.<br />
Even though Max lost this one, i&#8217;m not jumping off the bandwagon.  he&#8217;s a great quarterback who could have benefitted from more balanced play calling.</p>

						<p>If I didn&#8217;t know better, I would have guessed Max was wearing a red t-shirt under his jersey the way he was throwing the ball to the Utes.  Of all the games to self-destruct&#8230;I feel for him but he really needs to get control over his emotions and focus keeping his composure during the entire game.  I&#8217;m not going to jump off the Max bandwagon because he&#8217;s done an exceptional job the past two season.  Going 10-2 is amazing and we all have a bad day at the office&#8230;it&#8217;s just unfortunate Max had to have his against Utah.  Hopefully somebody sits him down and helps him improve not only his mechanics but also his mental frame of mind, which in my opinion, can be just as important as the physical ability of a player.  I look forward to see what bowl game the Cougars are heading to and find out who they will be playing.  It&#8217;s been a fun season, my hat goes off to the players and coaches, GO COUGARS!!</p>

						<p>I can see that we can all type with bile in our mouths.  Congrats to Utah.  They played a whale of a game.  I&#8217;m just glad that I don&#8217;t live in the state and have to hear about it for the next year.  I thought our guys played a good game.  I thought most of the game was played at a very high level.  We just found quicksand, ala &#8220;The Replacements&#8221; .    Harvey and Fui and the line did a terrific job executing the run game, but we have been living with Hall to Pitta all season.  Saturday, as much as we as fans, after the game, will bemoan the play calling, the last couple of games would show us that with Harvey&#8217;s shoulders, you had to limit his touches.  Our game is balance and that means going to the tight end over the middle.  We had two bad reads there and it cost us big time.  Feces occurs.  I&#8217;ve been looking for Max to run a bit more when the pocket collapsed.  He did, and got the ball slapped out of his hand.  They made plays.  We didn&#8217;t.    Their senior quarterback and recievers were ahead of our 1st year starting backers and depleated secondary.  Advantage them.  They made us pay.  I acknowledge that they caused as many mistakes as we made.  I will be upset about this game for weeks, maybe months because I love my cougs.  If I were coaching them, I would tell them that they can get it done in a bowl game, that they are my guys and I&#8217;m proud of them win or lose.  Strap it up and knock the snot out of whatever pac 10 weenie gets on the field with them.</p>

						<p>Why did we not run the ball more?  BYU averaged 7 yards a carry.  Harvey had 116 yards on 15 carries.  If you had told me Harvey would have over 100 yards rushing I would have said BYU would have a great chance to win the game.  Harvey could have had 200 yards rushing.  You would have thought BYU had learned their lesson about abandoning the run game against TCU, but Anae is too prideful to admit mistakes.  He needs to get over his pride and adjust his game plan when he sees a weakness in another teams defense.  Utah came into that game knowing they could drop 8 men into pass defense and BYU would still pass the ball on nearly every down.  Yes Max made mistakes, but he shouldn&#8217;t be thrown into the position of having to pass on nearly every down.</p>

						<p>All this talk about the run game is just 20/20 hindsight. Besides, doesn&#8217;t Max have a choice to audible if he thinks a run is going to work? Sure, the running plays worked because we caught them off guard at times, but who&#8217;s to say if we called more of them  they wouldn&#8217;t have adjusted quickly and stopped those? Then everybody would be saying, &#8220;That dopey Anae. He should have called more pass plays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Give Anae a break. I just can&#8217;t believe all the second guessing that goes on. It&#8217;s so reminiscent of what happened with Chow. Let&#8217;s not run another great offensive coordinator out of town!</p>

						<p>Here&#8217;s the deal about Anae.  He doesn&#8217;t make adjustments.  You can&#8217;t expect Max to audible on every single down.  We run the ball and the Utes would probably make adjustments.  That is when you start throwing the ball over the top.  You need to set up the pass with the run.  You don&#8217;t just pass the ball all game long and say, &#8220;well Utah probably would have adjusted and put more men in the box against the pass.&#8221;  In some games you may need to make 5-6 big adjustments in what you are doing.</p>
<p>Gametime adjustments are part of the game and we lost becuase our offense failed to make adjustments.  Remember when Ronnie Jenkins and Brian Mckenzie rushed for something like 300 yards against Utah?  That was right there for the taking on Saturday and if Utah had made adjustments, atleast at that point they wouldn&#8217;t be dropping 8 men into pass coverage.</p>

						<p>Paul,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if we got outschemd as much as we just have an inferior QB.  Seriously, if everyone would stop giving Max a pass, and rationalizing his incompetence away, then MAYBE we could start developing a new QB.  I&#8217;d rather go 6-6 every few years, if it means we go to a BCS game every 4 years.  Sure if we want to go 10-2 every year, end up 3rd in the MWC, and play in the Vegas bowl, then Max is the man for the job.  If you want more than that, we need a new QB.  He is definitely the weakest link on the offense.</p>

						<p>Re: Casey Tanner </p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Hall threw  for over 3,500 yards, 34 TDs  and completed almost 70% of his passes for the season! I guarantee that most schools (outside of the Big 12, and even then, some of them too) would kill for a QB with those numbers. Not to mention that he lead the offense on game-winning drives all season long until last Saturday. He had one bad game this season. On top of all of that, you are unfortunately forgetting that the coaching staff didn&#8217;t have very much confidence in the other QBs on the roster this year, so that is why Collie was listed as the back-up for a while. I don&#8217;t know of any true fan that would be satisfied going 6-6 every couple years, and to think that we could make a BCS game every four years is pretty unrealistic as well. Me personally, would rather have the team finish 10-2 or 9-3 every year than 6-6 every couple years. You really need to chill out and realize that while we did lose to Utah, it didn&#8217;t completely ruin our season. I hate to lose to them just as much as any fan does, but give credit where it is due &#8211; Utah outplayed us all game long and finished the season undefeated, which is better than probably close to 90% of the teams in the FBS. BYU&#8217;s record is still better than at least 75% of FBS teams too. Get a life!</p>

						<p>Brendon Gaskins loves Casey Tanner!!!</p>
<p>Max has won a lot of games as a Cougar and while you might not like him very much he will be the starter next year. </p>
<p>Next year he&#8217;ll win games and hopefully beat Utah and everyone will forget his 08&#8242; performance.</p>
<p>If BYU can go 10-2 every year they are awsome and nothing in broken. 10 wins isn&#8217;t easy to do!!! Just because it looks easy on Saturday doesn&#8217;t mean it is easy. BYU can&#8217;t expect to go to BCS games THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO KEEP BYU OUT!!!!!!! </p>
<p>BYU instead needs to win the MWC and beat Utah, and let the chips fall where they may. </p>
<p>I respect Utah for their accomplishments this year. They won all their close games and finished a-top a very competative MWC. They are going to preform well against a mediocre appoinent in a BCS game and make our conference look good&#8230;.again.  </p>
<p>I hope BYU will get the same opportunity, but to measure our programs success by a BCS ruler isn&#8217;t what BYU needs to do. I hope BYU doesn&#8217;t lose site of MWC dominace simply to put all their hopes in busting the BCS. That could mean more great, but seemingly disappointing season in the future.</p>

						<p>Casey Tanner,</p>
<p>I really hope you are not a Ute fan because you will be giving us a bad name. I am a Ute fan and I can tell you I would love to have a QB like Max Hall playing for the U.  He is a big part of the reason BYU has 10 wins. 10 wins is still a great season. How many winning drives has he had, Utah last year (which killed me!), UNLV and CSU this year come to mind. It is fans like you that give the rest of us fans (Utah or BYU) a bad rap. </p>
<p>Quinn,<br />
As a Utah fan, love the website and the player&#8217;s point of views. Keep it up!</p>

						<p>I agree with Cougfan.  The &#8217;96 beatdown was one of my favorite BYU-utah games because the Cougs just ran it down their throats and physically beat them. </p>
<p>Why did BYU not do this more in this game?  Pitta was obviously hurt and could not play to his ability (which brings up another question as to why A. George was not used in practice and prepared for this game), Hall was obviously frazzled and was locked onto Collie, plus everybody knows that BYU&#8217;s big O-Line is a strength against the u&#8217;s small D-line when you run it right at them.  </p>
<p>It just seems over and over again, in games this year and other years, that Anae doesn&#8217;t have the patience for the run game.  Look at what utah did on offense.   They took the 6,7,8 yard underneath throw and patiently moved the ball down the field.  They did not come out and try to run right at BYU as they have in most of their games this season.  They adjusted for this game and attacked BYU&#8217;s weakness in their injury-riddled secondary.  Why didn&#8217;t BYU do something similar?  Why not patiently attack that small D-line, pound on them to slow them down and then throw the ball if they adjust and stop it. </p>
<p>Remember in &#8217;96.  Sarkisian was having a great year and then they roll into RES (the pit of the universe) and he throw something like 9-10 passes ALL GAME while Jenkins and Mackenize ran for 300+.  That is coaching and/or game planning.</p>

						<p>Hells Bells, Hall has a bad game and some of you fools are ready to throw him under the bus.  The great Ty Detmer had some games like that (I think his last college game was pretty similar).  Hall is on the list of BYU greats, and is going to have an amazing year next year, much like he did this year and last year.</p>
<p>Same with Anae, you whiners sound like a bunch of spoiled brats, go back to your Madden X Box games and show your brilliant prowess there.  </p>
<p>If ya&#8217;ll are so $%# smart and it&#8217;s so easy why don&#8217;t you start coaching somewhere?  Ya bunch of estrogen filled pillow fighting sissy whiners, quit acting like you just got dumped by your ex. </p>

						<p>How is it that everyone thinks that it is unrealistic that we go to a BCS bowl every 4 years. UTAH IS DOING IT!  and BSU would be if Utah wasn&#8217;t ranked 1 spot higher.  Sorry I&#8217;m not complacent being an above average nonBCS team.  </p>
<p>And Max hasn&#8217;t had 1 bad game this season, he has had several.  TCU, Utah State (2 INT against a horrible defense), CSU (had to win us the game because he nearly lost us the game), and Utah. </p>
<p>So what we be wrong with starting to develop a new QB now so that in a few years we can make it to a BCS bowl?  Max clearly isn&#8217;t capable of accomplishing that.</p>

						<p>Max Hall wins the heisman next year if<br />
1. Austin Collie comes back<br />
2. He learns to not stare down the receiver for the whole play<br />
3. He wins the 3 big games we will have next year FSU, TCU, Utah</p>
<p>Those are all realistic goals for him, I think Casey Tanner is being irrational to an extent, I like Max Hall, but &#8230;&#8230;. he has consistently not shown up for big games throughout his career. He dominates against lesser opponents the only big game i can think of that he has shown up for was UCLA this year, and it turns out that they weren&#8217;t very good at all. I&#8217;m not ready to give up on Hall but he needs to learn how to perform in big games.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look back just one game: Air Force on the road in Colorado Springs. Tough game against an 8-2 team playing very well this year (remember, THEY played Utah close on the road, only losing by a TD). Max may have made some mistakes but delivered big time when it counted. HUGE nearly length of field drive at the end.</p>

						<p>OK, with a qualifier, I said it too, but although &#8220;run the ball more&#8221; looks like an easy answer, it isn&#8217;t. The only time that &#8220;run the ball more&#8221; might have made a difference was on BYU&#8217;s first two drives. </p>
<p>The first drive stopped after a 3rd and 2 ended in an incomplete pass, with Utah setup to stop the run. BYU had completed one 4-yd pass and Unga had run once for 4 yds. I&#8217;d guess (in hindsight) that  BYU had a 60% chance to get a first down with another run. But I&#8217;d give at least as good of odds that they get a 1st down with a pass. It&#8217;s a tossup call with good execution possibly leading to 4 pts and a temporary lead. </p>
<p>2nd drive. BYU gets a holding call leading to 1st and 12. Unga rushes for 5 for 2nd and 7. Next play, another run? A good result might get you a 3rd and 3. A good pass gets you 3rd and 2 or a first down. Result, loss of 3 on a pass to Unga, 3rd and 10. Obvious pass play leads to incomplete. Punt</p>
<p>BYU scores TDs on its next two drives while mixing passing and running.</p>
<p>BYU&#8217;s first interception did come on the fifth consecutive pass play in the drive, BUT, it was during a 2 minute drill just before the half with only one  timeout left. Running the ball there only makes sense  in hindsight, not in the game situation.</p>
<p>Next int comes from a play where BYU, using short passes, had set up Collie for a deep pass which Utah had left open earlier.  This time, the safety stays deep and makes a play. Again, hindsight says run the ball,  but when? On the plays before the deep pass so the deep play is not setup? Run on the play that the deep pass is thrown, and negate the setup? If you give up what has worked because something bad might happen, you concede the game. </p>
<p>Next turnover. BYU runs on first down, Max Hall is stripped while starting to run towards what should be a first down. &#8220;Run the ball more&#8221; doesn&#8217;t apply much here.</p>
<p>Third Int. Start of the 4th qtr, BYU down by 10. BYU had 3rd and 2, but then 3rd and 7 on their own 33 due to false-start. Run the ball? Maybe. Odds are against it succeeding and you need a drive at this point.  BYU tries to throw a pass to Unga instead of handing it off. He looks open, but Utah runs a trick play &#8211; Kruger has run over from his right DE position and dropped into zone coverage in the flat on the opposite end of the line. Kruger is not part of Hall&#8217;s coverage reads, especially on that side of the field. Kruger has come into the zone from the opposite side from where Hall is watching as Unga runs from Hall&#8217;s right to left. Watching Unga, Hall sees him open and throws the ball, LEADING him, not throwing to where he has looked, but throwing to where Unga will be. Hall&#8217;s mistake? Not if he&#8217;s done what he&#8217;s coached and accounted for his reads. If he scans the field before throwing, the timing is disrupted and the pIay probably fails. I think that THE BIG BYU MISTAKE was the false-start on third and two, which gave Utah the ideal time to try their trick with Kruger. Utah was lucky that Kruger ended up in the right spot for BYU&#8217;s play-call, but it wasn&#8217;t a huge risk for them if it didn&#8217;t work, given the position on the field. </p>
<p>I believe that was the key play of the game. After a 4 yard TD play, Utah leads by 17. BYU did mix run and pass afterwards and drove down the field. If they had scored then and held Utah, leaving say, 6 minutes in the game and the score at 31-41, the outcome might have been very interesting. But, &#8220;running the ball more&#8221; during that drive still resulted in another turnover.</p>
<p>I believe the entire argument about &#8220;running the ball more&#8221; really comes down to only two plays in the 1st quarter. It wasn&#8217;t a question of using the run as both series included runs. It was when. Both cases were 50-50 decisions.</p>
<p>The unconditional &#8220;run the ball more&#8221; idea, is mostly an emotional response to the fact that Hall was intercepted 5 times. BYU did, in fact, blend running and passing with mixed results. My initial comment was based on the idea that if BYU&#8217;s defense had closed down Utah&#8217;s 1st quarter offense, BYU might have started off with a 10 point lead. At that point, pushing the offensive mix more towards the run becomes more feasible with the pressure on Utah&#8217;s defense to adjust to stop them.</p>

						<p>Thanks CougB, and I would also add that by running the ball more BYU would have reduced the time left in the game and therefore reduced the amount of possessions they would have received towards the end of the game. Either way we would of had to put the game in Max&#8217;s hands and asked him to win the game for us. </p>
<p>Krugers play was an amazing call/execution of the call/ a bit of luck/ and a lot of skill. I love to see that kind of defensive play because 1. it doesn&#8217;t happen all that much and 2. I like to see players making great plays when there team needs them. </p>
<p>All you can do is smile.</p>

						<p>Casey we all realize you are a passionate cougar fan and your input is welcome but try to add something new to the conversation.  On the top of this blog Quinn should put a link to one of your several &#8220;Max thinks he is so sick but he is a worthless headcase&#8221; statements and we can be done with it. </p>
<p>You seem like a well meaning cougar fan and I&#8217;m sure you have some valuable input to make.  Let&#8217;s hear what that is.  </p>
<p>Max is not perfect but he is BYU&#8217;s best quarterback right now and it&#8217;s not even close.  Hopefully he will get better and improve and all of his teammates will do the same.  I too think he can be too cocky sometimes but on the other hand you need some of that to be successful at this level.  How many of us have the confidence to succeed while at the same time the humility to prepare?  A balance very few have mastered.</p>
<p>Fortunately your view that Max thinks he is so sick has been dealt a serious blow.  Looking at his eyes all through the 4th quarter it was obvious that the weight of this loss was bearing down squarely on his shoulders.  If humbling Max is your hope I think you got it.  Let&#8217;s see what he does with it.</p>

						<p>Quinn this has been great this year to follow your blog.  Most Cougar fans hunger for this kind of input and the chance to be involved with comments.  So many of the other boards seem to digress to name calling worthless banter.</p>
<p>You and Staff and the others have done a great job of walking a fine line where you can give honest and objective analysis without actually throwing anyone under the bus to do it.</p>
<p>I love BYU football and respect Utah and all the other teams.  I hate the ugly aspects of the rivalry and the part some of our own fans play in it.  Utah played great this season and I wish them well.  After 30+ years of following the Cougars I have learned well that you can&#8217;t win every game.  </p>
<p>Knowing that we can lose on any given night is what makes following the Y so great.  If we dominated everyone and won 99% of the time I am sure all of us would have to admit that would become boring after awhile.</p>
<p>How the Cougars are winning and the effort to give their best effort in a way that represents the Church in the best possible light is the most gratiftying of all.  Quinn, you and those who are contributing to this sight are the epitomy of that example.  Thank you so very much for the influence you have had on me and my sons.  Hopefully Bronco and Co. and the players that follow can walk in your footsteps and we can forgive those that can&#8217;t quite measure up.</p>

						<p>I really think BYU should have come out in the 2nd half and pounded the ball with the run.  BYU had the most success on their drives when they used the run to set up the pass.  Even the commentators on TV noticed that BYU was having a ton of success setting up the pass with the run.  BYU failed to make Utah play both the run and the pass.  It seems like any time we get down by 10, our offense freaks out and decides they have to pass pass pass.  When we had the talent to play the power run game this year, why did we not use it?  We could have taken the time to wear down Utah&#8217;s defense.  I see no sense in passing when Utah is dropping that many defenders into pass coverage.  Hell, if you want to get Collie the ball, continue lining him up in the backfield.  That was successful as well.</p>

						<p>This from a Cougar Board: &#8220;Coach W said he prepared his team for BYU&#8217;s Passing game and they were in pass defense the whole game. Did you hear what he said? THis is what he did. Utah literally took every game BYU played this year and maybe last and statistically grafted in on the computer. Every Pass play was grafted on a football field screen. The play literally showed every pass from where it was thrown to where it was completed and finally ended up. The advantage of doing that kind of preparation was to literally show every passing lane that BYU uses during the process of their games. They trained their players to have those main passing lanes covered by linemen or DB&#8217;s on almost every play.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK so Utah was playing the lanes. Viewing the game it appeared that Max fixated on his receivers in order. If he needs to really zone in then why doesn&#8217;t he wear a darkened visor? Just zoning from the side would help especially if the opponents are playing the lanes. A few pump fakes, ala Brett Fauve, would work too.</p>
<p>There is a problem&#8230; it needs to be fixed&#8230; the Ute D wasn&#8217;t THAT great.</p>

						<p>Re: Casey Tanner</p>
<p>Casey, honestly, you must not have watched the same team that I watched all season long. To say that Max Hall is the weakest link on the offense is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, I will admit that he made mistakes during the Utah game as well as other games this season, but he still led the team to wins in most of those games. Against Utah State, he threw for over 300 yards and 2 TDs (and the Aggies weren&#8217;t ever really in the game). In the TCU game, he still threw for almost 275 yards. Against CSU, Max threw for nearly 400 yards AND 5 TDS!!! If you want to talk about the weakest link on offense how about you mention all of the penalties that killed drives all year long. That is the true weakest link, not the QB. And, the fact is, that the offense and defense didn&#8217;t show up and play a complete game all year really with the exception of the UCLA game. The fact that we were able to win the close games this year was because of Max Hall and his ability to read the defenses and deliver the ball.</p>
<p>One last thing, the Utes have not made the BCS every four years since it began back in the late 1990s. They made it in 2004. While it is most likely that they will make it this year as well, there is still two weeks of football games to be played before the bowl pairings are announced and there is still a slim chance that Boise State could get taken instead of Utah. Like I said, slim chance, but still technically possible. And, it would be the fifth season since Utah went to the BCS in 2004. If they make it again in 2012 or 2013, then you can start saying that it is a trend and that we aren&#8217;t doing things right to make the BCS. Until then, I don&#8217;t think you need to be so worried about it. I will take all of our conference championships and the national title over two BCS berths any day of the week.</p>

						<p>Slow down on criticizing Hall&#8230;</p>
<p>I remember when I was nothing more than a fan, with no depth of understanding of the game and no appreciation for what the players go through.  I was one of the losers that booed Matt Berry, until Crowton put Pendleton in.  That was such a bad move!  I really regret that.  If Berry had been able to play on a consistent basis, without having to worry that one bad play would make him sit out, he may very well have been one of the greats that we idolize.</p>
<p>The answer for helping a great QB reach his potential is not to threaten to play his back up.  Medenhall proved this with Beck.  Even after a struggling season in 2005, Medenhall let Beck play.  Even after choking in the Boston College game.  Coach let Beck play!  That is the answer.</p>
<p>Hall is a great QB.  He has already proven that.  Now more than ever he needs us selfish fans to give him support.  It&#8217;s just like Staff said, as fans we&#8217;ve never defeated or been defeated.  All we can do is back up our players.  That&#8217;s it.  That is what a real, dyed in the wool, true blue coug does.  </p>
<p>GO COUGS!!!</p>
