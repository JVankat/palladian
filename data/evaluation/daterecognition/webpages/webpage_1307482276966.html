<p>&#8220;Doc&#8221; acquired his moniker for selling eyeglasses, after he came to the Big Island in 1913.  Doc opened his Hill Optical Co. in the new Young Kwong Hoy bldg. in 1917, where today&#8217;s Douglas Yamamoto Jewelers recently were [between the Kress bldg. &amp; Basically Books].   Doc added his jewelry business in 1919, and both his optical and jewelry businesses were among the largest in our Territory.  But when GOP Doc was elected to our Territorial House of Representatives in 1928, Doc sold his optical and jewelry businesses to his bookkeeper, Fredrick Koehnen [today's Koehnen Enterprises].  Doc was elected to our Territorial Senate in 1932, and except for his sole defeat at the polls in 1936 when he lost by a mere 14 votes, Doc served continuously in the Territorial Senate 1932-1958, then in our State Senate [Statehood achieved 1959] 1959-1967, where he was senator emeritus for among the longest tenures in Hawai&#8217;i politics.   Let&#8217;s face it, Doc&#8217;s 40 years as Territorial solon cemented his slogan that &#8220;What helps Doc Hill helps Hawai&#8217;i!!&#8221;   <span id="more-11848"></span>Doc&#8217;s punchlist of business accomplishments:</p>
<p>1.  1913 &#8212; with no more than the shirt over his back, Doc peddled eyeglasses from his horse &amp; buggy. Doc epitomized Horatio Alger, Doc&#8217;s formal schooling ending in elementary school.</p>
<p>2.  1917 &#8211;Doc opened his Hill Optical Co. in today&#8217;s still existing 1964 Kamehameha Ave. bldg., which went on to be among the largest and most complete optical firms in our Territory.  Doc added his high grade jewelry line in 1919.</p>
<p>3.  1925 &#8211; Doc started his Hilo Finance &amp; Thrift Co. and his Realty Investment Co. [today's Hilo Shopping Center].</p>
<p>4.  1929 &#8211;Doc opened his loan &amp; investment firms at the former site of our Gaiety Theater, naming it the Realty Investment bldg., which still stands as today&#8217;s Caravan Town site next to today&#8217;s Salvation Army thrift store on Kamehameha Ave.</p>
<p>5.  1929 &#8212; Doc&#8217;s new loan/investment outfits developed the former Wetmore Estate at Kino&#8217;ole &amp; Haili Sts., which was subdivided &amp; sold to the later Elks Club &amp; YWCA.  Doc bought out the Stoddard service station &amp; changed the name to Hilo Motors Co.  Doc then bought out Hattie Lewis&#8217; estate makai/below the Wetmore Estate on the oceanside of Kino&#8217;ole/Haili Sts. &amp; sold a part to the Korean Methodist Church &amp; a part to the Haili Hill Land Co.  Doc&#8217;s outfits also bought the Harlocker Block/Bldg. at Mamo &amp; Kamehameha Ave. [today's Farmers Market site].</p>
<p>6.  1930 &#8211;Doc&#8217;s outfits bought the Pacific Soda Works from the E.H. Lyman Estate by today&#8217;s Elks Club on Kino&#8217;ole St. &amp; established the first Coca Cola franchise on the Big Island.  Irony is that Doc later built his megalith Coca Cola Bottling plant in the heart of Shinmachi [only Japan-named town in our Territory which translates to "New Town"] [Shinmachi started in January 1914 when our Little Tokyo fire demolished our Japanese business community where is today's downtown KTA parking</p>
<p>lot complex -- Shinmachi as our viable town ended with the 1946 April Fools Day tsunami which scoured</p>
<p>out Shinmachi, causing the greatest number of deaths at Shinmachi, which was between today's</p>
<p>Kamehameha Statue off Kamehameha Ave. &amp; our Hilo Iron Works bldg. complex by the Wailoa river]</p>
<p>corner Ke&#8217;elikolani/Punahoa Sts. just Keaukaha direction of today&#8217;s Kamehameha Statue, marked</p>
<p>by apparent rise/heiau which I take to be the rubble of the Coca-Cola Bottling plant 1946-1960 &#8212; Doc&#8217;s</p>
<p>Coca-Cola plant no sooner was in operation when our deadliest April Fools Day tsunami hit &#8212; if not</p>
<p>for Doc&#8217;s massive concrete 2 story bldg., 500 more Shinmachi residents would have been killed by the</p>
<p>tsunami had they not climbed up Doc&#8217;s stairway to Heaven/2nd floor lofting 40 feet above ground</p>
<p>level.  Doc&#8217;s nearly half million $ fortress resulted from Doc&#8217;s profitable WWII GI Coke thirst.</p>
<p>7.  1932 &#8211;Doc&#8217;s outfits bought the Beamer Block in Waiakea &amp; remodeled it&#8217;s bldgs. &amp; later sold them.</p>
<p>8.  1935 &#8211;Doc&#8217;s outfits bought White Star Laundry on Kamehameha Ave. where today&#8217;s canoe regatta</p>
<p>parking lot is, then built the largest modern laundry plant in our islands which is today&#8217;s Western Store</p>
<p>bldg.</p>
<p>9.  1936 &#8212; Doc became our Territory&#8217;s largest theater owner with Doc&#8217;s acquisition of most of our theaters</p>
<p>on our island.</p>
<p>10. 1938&#8211;Doc&#8217;s outfits bought Standard Drug Co. &amp; Canario Blocks corner Haili St./Kamehameha Ave. &amp; expanded</p>
<p>Standard Drug as among our Territory&#8217;s largest pharmacy outfits.  Earlier, Doc started the Men&#8217;s Shop for men&#8217;s clothiers &amp; sold it to John V.   Rezentes.  Doc also started Doc&#8217;s Island Hotel Ltd. &amp; built the Naniloa Hotel on Banyan Drive, which he sold to hotelier Walter D. Child in 1943.</p>
<p>11. 1939 &#8211;Doc started Excelsior Dairy pasteurizing plant in Shinmachi by buying a dairy herd in Pi&#8217;ihonua</p>
<p>[pasteurizing started in Hilo with Doc Hill].</p>
<p>12. 1940&#8211;  Doc bought the 1922 Ludwig Block/Crescent City Cracker Co. on Pi&#8217;opi&#8217;o/Kamehameha Ave. which</p>
<p>eventually became our island&#8217;s first shopping center [original Hilo Shopping Ctr. post-1946 tsunami,</p>
<p>located where today's Bayside Chevron is on Kamehameha/Pauahi Sts.].  Doc&#8217;s 2nd shopping ctr.</p>
<p>1962 is today&#8217;s Hilo Shopping Ctr. [Doc's original   shopping ctr. was destroyed by the 1946/1960 tsunamis].</p>
<p>13. 1946&#8211; started Flowers of Hawai&#8217;i for Vanda orchids, which branched out to anthuriums [finest in the</p>
<p>world] &amp; other plants.</p>
<p>14. 1948 &#8212; headed Helco after Kimo Henderson moved to O&#8217;ahu, &amp; became director for C. Brewer [broke</p>
<p>Big 5 cabal, being an unschooled Midwest plainsman who married gorgeous nurse Ouida, who posed for</p>
<p>Honolulu Mag in bikini in her 90s, Ouida a centenarian, but Ouida a despot to local non-haoles</p>
<p>via her imperious/haughty manners].</p>
<p>15.  1962 &#8212; wrested control of media giants via purchase of Hilo Trib/hui-syndicate purchase of Star-Bulletin/KGMB/KHBC/Hawai&#8217;i Publishing Holding Corp. By sheer common sense, Doc was the Great Co-opter</p>
<p>who recognized the growing Asian vote/suffrage &amp; jumped on the opportunity to have what became Asian majority voters go all-out for him with his electoral victories, thence Doc&#8217;s longest tenure in Territorial</p>
<p>politics, 4 decades!!    Aloha always,  — Curt</p>
<p><em>(Response from Hugh Clark to Curtis Narimatsu regarding Doc Hill)</em></p>
<p>Doc allegedly jumped ship and hid out with Hawaiians in Honomu for a spell before coming to town to sell eye glasses, The why of the glasses I do not know. He found a ready market in Orieentals with genetic visual defects.</p>
<p>I also know he was a big player for a time in the soft drink market.</p>
<p>As he was dying, he rewrote his will several times  to benefit Hilo (UH-H not Manoa), etc, etc, I was a frequent witness and watchd millions come and go from beneficiaries. Why me? I guess because he considered me clean and an unlikely claimant.</p>
<p>I came to enjoy the old man, but there was much I did not know. He was a splendid bizman and a wonderfully colorful legislator who did in the GOP regularly and earned the ILWU&#8217;s trust.</p>
<p>I was privileghed to observe his dying wish for Richard Henderson to succeed him. I attended a showdown with ILWU and Burns types at his Wailuku Drive home (again as a witness). He said if Burns did not choose Richard, he would die on the Senate floor. I believed him.</p>
<p>Only wished I had arrived sooner or he had lived longer.</p>
<p>Aloha, Hugh</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Thank you, gracious editor Tiffany C. Edwards Hunt, for publishing my notes above and for your accompanying cute photo.   Doc Hill actually jumped ship to sea and shore here as a fledgling young seaman.  Audacity punctuated Doc&#8217;s personality.  Doc started his concept of a shopping center when he bought the Ludloff bldg./Crescent City Bakery, but his dreams were swept away by the April 1 1946 tsunami.  He picked up the pieces [out of Waiolama Canal] and fulfilled his dream of a shopping center in 1952, anchored by Garry Ichino&#8217;s Pick N&#8217; Pay store [relocated from across Mo'oheau Park's AmFac warehouse/later called Cow Palace after Frisco's Cow Palace].   Ichino later recalled that Doc&#8217;s original shopping center concept was too small in space for Ichino&#8217;s expansive supermarket, and Ichino was happy to anchor Doc&#8217;s 2nd shopping center in 1962 [today's existent Hilo Shopping Center -- Ichino's Pick N' Pay supermarket taking up the corridor &amp; surrounding spaces of today's Kope Kope coffee shop/Restaurant Miwa/etc.].   Aloha, &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Senator Henderson is a fine gentleman.  If he was Doc&#8217;s protege that should speak volumes to todays Big Island residents.  Doc must have had a good eye for ethical quality people.</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>quips at start of magnanimous Kevin Steadman&#8217;s book‏ </p>
<p>&#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; &#8212; my pick of quotes at outset/start of book   &#8212; my thoughts here below &#8212;-</p>
<p>&#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; published in October 2009 by Kevin Steadman  (born December 7, 1953)  denotes running for fun and pleasure, as with a runner&#8217;s high, and Kevin&#8217;s extraordinary run into life&#8217;s unseen horizons reveals secrets about ourselves which only audacious exploration brings.   Kevin picked his book title &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; from waitress Dawn on the Tustumena ship during Kevin&#8217;s week long Alaska fishing trip with his dad.  This fishing trip is the backdrop for Kevin&#8217;s wondrous reminiscences on his family and on history.  Dawn repeated what Dawn&#8217;s mother said when Dawn was a child, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t do anything adventurous, the days, weeks, and months mix together to become years, and it&#8217;s like a gerbil&#8217;s wheel; you can&#8217;t tell one year from the next.  But by doing exciting things, you can remember different years and parts of your life.  It may not be for everyone, but it makes sense to me.&#8221;  (page 175 of Gerbil Wheels)     The irony of Gerbil Wheels is its contradiction, what Gerbils love is not what we perceive &#8212; life almost always is opaque, not crystal clear.  As author Kevin Steadman himself intones, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a bit evasive in the book.  I want the readers to find their own way rather than being led.  A few times I&#8217;ve been deliberate like when I say that we need to make the time or opportunity to do something otherwise that window may close, or nothing will happen.  And when I said this I had to ask myself if I really wanted to declare it&#8211;am I violating my own rules?    As you asked about the title, Gerbil Wheels, this too, becomes like a toy in the readers minds&#8211;they can play with it how they may.  I like the title because it is different, unique, universal.  I think as one reads the book and then stands back and looks at the bits and pieces they come away with &#8216;Yeah.  Gerbil Wheels. I can deal with that.&#8217;  I intentionally left out the passage where it is used  on page (175) off the back cover.  The readers need to discover it themselves, much like the digging through the Cracker Jacks to get to the prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin and beloved wife Mary Ann&#8217;s 19 year old son Quinn died 12 years ago in a car accident, and Kevin recalled<br />
vocalist Rod Stewart&#8217;s redux of Bob Dylan&#8217;s &#8220;Forever Young&#8221; tune, to wit:  &#8220;And when you finally fly away I&#8217;ll be hoping that I served you well&#8230;.&#8221;  (pages 164-165)    Kevin&#8217;s and Mary Ann&#8217;s  funeral tribute to their oldest son closed with a slide presentation of Quinn&#8217;s life, Quinn always smiling, and Kevin evokes, &#8220;I like to think Quinn approved of his funeral&#8230;. (t)he slide presentation was all that I prayed it would be.  It was moving, dynamic, a portrayal of a life, a summation, a gift.  It was every feeling I wanted to convey to my son&#8230; (t)o me, it was more than just for those in attendance.  It was for Quinn.&#8221;  (page 168) </p>
<p>Just prior to Kevin&#8217;s seafaring with his dad, Kevin rolls out Gen. Custer, &#8220;Self employed!  When a new business is registered and the local municipality mails the license, they should throw in a complementary picture of George Armstrong Custer at the last stand.  Health insurance, retirement, paid holidays, or the lack thereof &#8212; I was about to take advantage of a perk of my own making.  If you don&#8217;t create a cadence and keep time with it, what is it I read?  &#8216;Life is life, fun is fun, but when the goldfish dies it gets very quiet.&#8217;  With this jaunt to Alaska I was thumping the timpani head.&#8221;  (pages 5-6) </p>
<p>Kevin extols wife Mary Ann, &#8220;Mary Ann is wonderfully frugal.  During our first year of marriage, back in college, while she was pregnant with Shanda, she worked at a sewing factory about a mile from the little home we rented, the only time she has worked in our marriage.  One morning as she was getting ready to walk to work Mary Ann asked, &#8216;It is okay if I take the quarter if I bring back fifteen cents?&#8217;   Horror stories about the spending habits of some spouses are legend.  It gives some thought to the comment, &#8216;Behind every successful man is a woman that made it necessary.&#8217;&#8221; (page 10)</p>
<p>Kevin on his parents, &#8220;For whatever reason, with all the traveling my folks have done, they never picked up on the idea that you can check in luggage at the curb, thus avoiding lines in the terminal.  Dad was particularly surprised.  It must be something generational &#8212; kids showing their parents how things work.  &#8216;Gol, this is great,&#8217; Dad remarked. &#8216;I&#8217;ve never had anyone take care of me and not have to worry about anything.&#8217;&#8221;  (page 13)  </p>
<p>On William Adams Hickman 1816-1883, &#8220;In 1871 he (Hickman) dictated a sensational autobiography to anti-Mormon writer James H. Beadle from which the book Brigham&#8217;s Destroying Angel was published.  In the book Bill details the killing of about fifty Indians and five whites.  The publication of his autobiography and his testimony before a grand jury led to the arrest of Brigham Young and other Mormons, whom he accused of masterminding his confessed crimes.  In the end, excommunicated from his church with only Bernetta, his first and final wife, along with three of his grown daughters and their husbands and children, William Adams Hickman settled near Lander, Wyoming, to live out his eventful and often tumultuous life in peace.  He died on August 21, 1883.  His body was buried a day or two later in the Lander City Cemetery, only to be dug up and buried again &#8216;a half mile up the road from the Allen place&#8217; to satisfy the complaints of the locals.&#8221;  (pages 21-22)   &#8220;On the fourth floor of the southwest corner of the Harold B. Lee Library, which is centered like a nucleus in the cell of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, is an office with lettering on the outer glass that reads &#8216;Charles E. Redd Center of Historical Studies.&#8217;  A twenty-three-year-old college junior entered the main level of the library, one floor below, and lunged up the stairs two at a time.  Striding through a vacant foyer that led down a hallway to an open office, he encountered an older and scholarly gentleman sitting behind a wooden desk.  The scholar had a full head of grey hair, black glasses, and an indistinguishable sport coat and bow tie.  Without introduction or pleasantries the student, almost demanding, asked, &#8216;What do you know about William Adams Hickman?&#8217;  Looking up from his papers and without missing a beat, the scholar shot back, &#8216;He was a cold-blooded, psychopathic killer.  Why do you ask?&#8217;   &#8216;He was my great-great-grandfather.&#8217;  With a slight awkward hesitation and lowered voice, the historian recanted, &#8216;I didn&#8217;t mean it quite that way.&#8217;  For the student (Kevin Steadman), the question had been answered.&#8221;  (page 18)    For Kevin, life is about being open-minded.</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Utterly compassionate/loving Kevin Hickman Steadman&#8217;s &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; book (Oct. 2009) &#8212; quotes at start of book:</p>
<p>On Davy Crockett,  &#8220;Politics are the real game.  Your life, ego, and self-esteem are on four-by-eight foot lawn signs posted around your town.  It is standing in front of your friends, family, and critics, being examined, like Legos, to see who you are, how you fit.  When the votes are counted and the tally is in, it was nothing more than another numbers game, but you take it personally, very personally.  How can you not?   Davy Crockett, disenchanted with the voters of Tennessee for not returning him to Congress for a third term, hot-headedly dismissed his constituents:  &#8216;You may all go to hell and I will go to Texas,&#8217; and struck out for Texas to assuage his ego.  Yet it was losing his life to Santa Ana&#8217;s armies that gave Crockett the fame he couldn&#8217;t achieve in his political career.&#8221;  (page 55)</p>
<p>On Douglas Stringfellow, &#8220;In 1952 a thirty year old World War II veteran, Douglas R. Stringfellow, was overwhelmingly elected as a United States Representative to the House of Congress from the First District of Utah.  He was a paraplegic, paralyzed from the waist down from injuries sustained by an anti-personnel mine explosion on a military mission in France in 1944.  In January of 1954 a surprised and humbled Stringfellow appeared on the nationally televised program, &#8216;This Is Your Life,&#8217; where he was honored and lauded for his wartime and civic contributions.  He was also selected by the National Junior Chamber of Commerce as one of the ten outstanding young men in America in 1953.  In June of 1954 he gave the commencement address at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and was asked by Ernest L. Wilkinson, president of BYU, to talk specifically of his wartime exploits.  He was assured of renomination by his party to Congress&#8230;.  The story of Stringfellow&#8217;s experiences contained every ingredient for perfect entertainment:  Thrills, drama, mystery, suspense, violence, faith, love, and finally, success and happiness.  No imaginative scenarist could have topped it, except Doug Stringfellow.  Yet it was all a hoax, a lie, a whopper, a real leg extender&#8230;. As Representative Stringfellow&#8217;s first term in Congress was winding down, his re-election campaign for 1954 was in full swing.  Questions of his war record began to surface.  Allegations that his covert heroic experiences were false were being whispered, first as gossip, then as accusations declared by the opposing party.  War records, particularly sensitive information that would hold the facts, were sealed and could not be accessed.  The Defense Department was strangely quiet for fear of offending a Congressman&#8230;. Finally, the &#8216;Army Times,&#8217; an unofficial military journal, published a story alleging that Stringfellow&#8217;s military history &#8216;would not hold water.&#8217;   With the immense pressures building and having kept this secret to himself, not even sharing the story with his wife, Shirley, or his father, or even his campaign manager, but knowing the truth, Stringfellow confessed.  On Saturday, October 16, 1954, at 5 p.m., local Salt Lake City TV station KSL aired his ten-minute confession, which was picked up by the networks and broadcast sensationally across the nation.   With his wife, two little sons, campaign manager, and Senator Watkins off-camera in the studio watching, a tearful and penitent Doug Stringfellow related that when he first began to speak in front of audiences, he was asked for more details about his experiences and soon found himself being introduced as a war hero.  &#8216;Like many other persons suddenly thrust into the limelight, I rather thrived on the adulation and new-found popularity&#8230;. I began to embellish my speeches with more picturesque and fanciful incidents.  I fell into a trap, which in part had been laid by my own glib tongue.  I became a prisoner of my own making.  I was never an OSS agent.  I never participated in any secret, behind-the-lines mission&#8230; I never captured Otto Hahn or any other German physicist&#8230; It was all a hoax.&#8217;   I don&#8217;t know why the life of Douglas R. Stringfellow has such interest to me.  Maybe it&#8217;s because there is a whopper in all of us, the one that got away&#8230;.  Once we come in from playing and hose ourselves off, I think we have more in common with each other than we realize.  Initially critical of Stringfellow, the more that surfaces about his life, the more I wish that I could have known him.  He died in Long Beach, California, in 1966.  His marriage to Shirley was strong and happy.  This says much about her as well&#8230;. A bit more revealing in explaining his imaginative war experience, Stringfellow wrote, &#8216;There were no past accomplishments for me to think about.  I hadn&#8217;t graduated from college when Uncle Sam called.  I hadn&#8217;t been in love except for one or two infatuations long since forgotten.  So, when the S mine did explode, my life had ended before it had really begun.  Without a past to recall, a future to plan and build for, I fled each night to that world of fantasy where time and space did not exist.  I roamed the battlefields of the world, conquering the enemy and restoring peace to a war-torn earth&#8230;. Thus, psychologists do not think it so strange that I awoke one morning consciously remembering my dramatic but imaginary part in a war that was all too real.&#8217;  In the small cache of documents, speeches and letters I had sniffed out about Doug was a particular letter written to him on Tuesday, October 19, 1954, three days after his public Saturday afternoon TV confession, by Angele de T. Gingras, a newspaper person, I suspect, judging from the prose and format&#8230;.<br />
&#8216;You see, Mr. Stringfellow, there is something you forget.  We all lie.  Your lies were just more effective and dramatic and brave, and reached a larger audience than the braggadocio of most.   My acquaintance is crowded with people who tell beautiful lies&#8230;. I have never met you, Mr. Stringfellow, and I only went through Utah once in an automobile, but I know exactly how that story of your heroism got started.  I know it because I know the whole laughing fiction of the tall story of our frontier tradition.&#8217;   Doug&#8217;s life after his confessions was difficult, obscure, and short.  He died in 1966, only twelve years after his confession, living twenty years longer than the doctors forecast.  The play of numbers in his life is interesting:  Born in 1922, wounded in 1944, died in 1966:  Living a half-life of only forty-four years; twenty-two, half again, as a paraplegic<br />
from wounds suffered in action serving his country.&#8221;  (pages 56, 62, 64-67, 69-72)</p>

  Your comment on &#8220;Frisco&#8221; is correct.  Living  in Northern California years ago, all of my friends called San Francisco the &#8220;city&#8221;, &#8220;San Fran&#8221; or the &#8220;bay area.&#8221;</p>
<p>  No one ever said Frisco. Ever.</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Sunday, April 18, 1920, Hilo Tribune article which I dedicate to the new Pepe&#8217;ekeo Farmers Market, located on Hwy. 19 Mamalahoa Belt Rd. a quarter mile north of the Post Office off Ka&#8217;akepa St.  The Pepe&#8217;ekeo Farmers Market will open on Thursday, January 21, 2010 (90 yrs. after our Trib article below) 2:00 p.m. till dusk, and again on the following Sunday dawn to 2:00 p.m.  For more details, call 315-5536.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Hawaiian Legend Reveals Battle of Pepehina-Nanahu&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the &#8216;Battle of Pepehina-Nanahu&#8217; the Tribune today presents a Hawaiian legend having to do with ancient times on the island of Hawaii.  The following was compiled by Theodore Kelsey of Hilo from information given him by Mr. James A. Iokepa of Hilo &#8212;   In ancient times it was the custom in Kaupakuea for several families to cook their food together in one imu, or underground oven.  During the day, the man in charge of this imu called to the neighbors when it was ready:  &#8216;Come people, our imu is cooked.&#8217;  After sunset, however, this method was kapu, or strictly forbidden.  No man who valued his life dared to call aloud to another at this hour!   No, indeed!  He summoned his neighbors by slapping a pa ipu, or gourd calabash.<br />
   One evening this sacred rule, most religiously observed for generations immemorial, was violated!  &#8216;Come people, our imu is cooked,&#8217; called a foolish and irreverent man, as though it were daylight!<br />
   Not a soul ventured forth!  All sat cowering in their houses, filled with fear and horror at this awful sacrilege!</p>
<p>           &#8216;HERE WE ARE&#8217; IS CRY</p>
<p>   &#8216;Here we are!&#8217; cried myriads of shrill voices on all sides of the imu.  Here they were indeed!  Thousands of grotesque little creatures surrounded the unfortunate culprit!  Here were the Menehunes, the mischievous little brownies of Hawaii, out for a night of revel!<br />
   &#8216;And what are you here for?&#8217; asked the offender in a trembling voice.<br />
   &#8216;You called us!&#8217; &#8212; The accusation rang like a peal of thunder &#8212; then profound silence.<br />
   What was to be done?  Through those menacing hosts, he could not flee!  They swarmed about the imu and began to mock their terrified victim!  Was it a horrible nightmare?  Hardly knowing what he did, he sought relief in action.   He tore open the imu, seized the steaming taro, and hurled it with all his might at his tormentors.  </p>
<p>          MAY HAVE IT ALL</p>
<p>&#8216;If you want the imu you may have us in its wake!&#8217;  Alas!  The taro was gone!  Then he plucked the hot rocks from the floor of the imu and hurled them after the taro.  The execution was even more terrible than the fiery vengeance of Pele!  Torrents of blood rushed seaward, washing out a large hollow below the imu.  Alas!  The stones were gone!  The foes pressed close upon him!  Desperately he snatched the charred wood from the bottom of the imu and continued the slaughter!  Alas!  The charcoal was gone!  What would become of him now?   He shuddered at the thought.  Determined to save his life as dearly as possible, he stood with clenched fists, awaiting the onslaught.<br />
   What?!  The Menehunes stood motionless, gazing eastward!  It was as though some mighty magician had suddenly transformed them into images of stone!  Look!  The first faint rays of dawn were stealing forth over the sea!  The spell was broken!  Away scampered the Menehunes as though awakened from enchantment by the power of some great presence whom they feared.  Away they went, nor did they cast a single glance behind them until safe in their woodland retreats.  </p>
<p>          SAVED BY A HAIR</p>
<p>   Saved by a hair-breadth!   Utterly exhausted, he fell at the foot of the imu where he had so nearly dug his own grave.<br />
   He awoke with a start!  The sun was up, and a clamoring crowd was gazing curiously at him.  Thanks be to the gods!  It was only his wondering neighbors!  He sat up and looked dazedly about him.  Yes, there was the ruined imu, and below it, the blood-washed valley!  It was not a dream!  It was all true!   Never again would he defy the powers of darkness!<br />
   To this day the little valley which was washed out by the blood of the Menehunes is known as Pepehina-Nanahu!&#8221;</p>
<p>Descriptively, Pepehina is to kill, and nanahu is to turn to charcoal.  The final onslaught by charcoal.  Fortitude, resilience, abiding reverence for tradition and custom &#8212; such sentiments characterize the legend of the little valley and the stream which runs through it, snuggled beneath the the twin hills of Pepe&#8217;ekeo, where lore also has it that this is where Kamapua&#8217;a tried to drown Hina, mother of Maui.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst nearly to all folks, Theodore Kelsey 1891-1987 helped germinate our Hawaiian Language Arts Program at UH-Hilo, which he graciously credited to his spiritual haumana/ubiquitous icon Edith Kanaka&#8217;ole.  Kelsey&#8217;s ho&#8217;ohaumana/prodigy is June Gutmanis 1925-1998, who is my alter ego/mentor.  June is noted for her Kahuna La&#8217;au Lapa&#8217;au &amp; Na Pule Kahiko books, among other works.  Bill Westervelt 1849-1939 preceded Kelsey in translation of Hawaiian legends into English.  Westervelt is the genesis of our polyglot YMCA here, among other accomplishments [seeded today's East-West Center].  I dedicate this lookback to our cultural antecedents to Guenn Adare, a student of life and history.   Love always, &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>John M. Horner &amp; his famous homing/carrier pigeons [who carried messages from his Papa'aloa abode to his Kuka'iau sugar plantation] overshadow Horner&#8217;s greatest feat &#8212; Horner planted Guatemalan coffee along his &#8220;Gold Coast&#8221; [Papa'aloa to Kuka'iau] &#8216;aina/lands, vastly superior in quality to the existing Brazilian variety in 1895, then called koppe/Hawaiian coffee.  Zentaro Inaba [Hollywood starlet Carrie Inaba's great-grandpa] planted Horner&#8217;s seedlings in 1897, &amp; Kunigoro Yokoyama did such in 1899, and these are how 1) independent Japanese immigrants became Kona&#8217;s mega-coffee growers; and 2) what is known today as &#8220;Kona Coffee&#8221;/&#8221;Kona Gold&#8221; is Horner&#8217;s famous Guatemalan coffee.  My immigrant maternal grandparents picked up on Horner&#8217;s Guatemalan coffee, raising such in Honalo, North Kona, and today my oldest aunt, Shizuko Mary Teshima, age 102 [born June 1907], owner of Japanese cuisine restaurant Teshima&#8217;s [she married Harry Teshima], still picks this Guatemalan coffee on her 40 acres of coffee-rich &#8216;aina.  &#8220;Small world,&#8221; because Guenn Adare, student of life and history, is from Guatemala, and often is mistaken for speaking English as her 2nd language, yet English is her primary language.  Small world even more, because Guenn&#8217;s Hawai&#8217;i home is along Horner&#8217;s &#8216;aina where he planted the Guatemalan coffee, and Guenn&#8217;s work site in Pu&#8217;u'eo is where my dad swam as a child [Pukihae stream].  Beautiful coincidences.   Love always, &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>From compassionate Kevin Steadman&#8217;s amazing &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; book:</p>
<p>On motorcycles:  &#8220;&#8230;Charlie more than made up for the penurious wages.  Knowing I liked motorcycles and was without wheels, he surprised me one day by saying, &#8216;you ought to see that motorsickle ol&#8217; Mackay&#8217;s got in his shed.  It&#8217;s a good one.&#8217;  I asked him what kind it was, and Charlie didn&#8217;t know but prefaced, &#8216;If it was Mackays, you knew it was a good stick.&#8217;  When I first saw Boanerges my mind seized briefly.  I didn&#8217;t know what to think; it was purely Charlie.  It was something Batman would ride.  Under a shroud of dust was a deep purple 1956 BMW R50 motorcycle with a customized fairing shaped like a bat with extended wings.  Two matching purple fiberglass saddles bags slung low against the back wheel, likely detailed by hippies, dripped of roadster appeal.  They were painted white lace and studded with some type of garnet stones that you might find on the breast collar of Silver, Roy Rogers&#8217; horse.  Three, four-inch white leather straps spaced evenly in a horizontal row dangled from the sides just to make you look longer.  I didn&#8217;t know whether to laugh, swear, or run.  It wouldn&#8217;t be until several years later and many thousands of miles that I would begin to really appreciate Boa for what he was; an incredible creation of post-Reich German workmanship at its finest, all heart, never missing a beat.  Late at night I could be stopped at a stop light and have a guy in the car next to me roll down his window, thoughtfully taking in the lines and geodetic engineering, acknowledging a characteristic in Boa I could never know, and silently give me a thumbs up and knowing nod of his head.&#8221;  (pages 91-93)</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>From tremendous figure of equanimity &#8211;Kevin Hickman Steadman &#8212; from his heartstopper &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; (Oct. 2009) book &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was in Wendover, Utah, during the war (WWII).&#8217; (said an older man in 1974)  I could sense that he was not interested in what I was selling, but I was curious why he had been in Utah.  As we continued the conversation he said he had been doing some training in Wendover with the atomic bomb and would occasionally get to Salt Lake City&#8230; I knew Wendover had been an Air Force base and was curious if he had done any flying.   (Mormon)Missionaries travel in twos, work in twos, eat in twos, fight in twos, and should never lose sight of the other.  I did something I had never done in the previous year-and-a-half &#8212; I left my companion, telling him I was going in the store and would be right back&#8230; Approaching him (the older man), I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t mean to follow you around, but I was just wondering if you did any flying during the war.&#8217;  He said that he had flown in Europe as a navigator and was with the crew that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  I had done a lot of reading before my mission and was very familiar with the incident.  &#8216;You flew with Colonel Paul Tippets on the Enola Gay?&#8217;  &#8216;Tibbets,&#8217; he corrected me.  This man was very calm, almost serene.  My thoughts were running, yet I had a strong presence of mind.  I knew this encounter was chance and that I&#8217;d probably never see him again.  In high school I had debated the morality of the bomb and had read &#8216;Hiroshima&#8217; by John Hershey.  After my mission I would become familiar with the torpedoing of the heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis, the ship that delivered the bomb Little Boy to Tinian, the island the Enola Gay took off from, and the five days the survivors were in the water before the ship was reported overdue from its port in Guam, and how the sharks, injuries, and elements had pared the crew down from around 900 to 317 before they were rescued.  I would shake hands with General Paul Tibbets, Ret., at a trade show twenty-eight years later in Wichita, Kansas, and give him a Hooey Stick imprinted with my company name and show an amused, reticent Tibbets how it worked.  &#8216;What was your position on the airplane?&#8217; I cautiously probed the man&#8230; &#8216;I was the bombadier.&#8217;  &#8216;You pulled the lever, so to speak,&#8217; I said as I motioned with my right arm.  &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  My face flushed.  I don&#8217;t recall any movement or activity in the store, nor sounds &#8212; just his eyes on mine.  During the fortieth anniversary of the drop in 1985, I would snap off a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, blasting the critics who held lighted candles and chanted slogans in protest of the inhumane, unnecessary, and immoral use of the bomb.  Later, I would fly to Tokyo and spend some time with Mr. Itoh, an older business associate, who felt a need to apologize for the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.  I would intimate that we got our licks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and he would thank me for saving the lives of millions of his countrymen.  Quietly, respectfully, I pressed (to the older man in the store), &#8216;How do you feel about it?&#8217;   &#8216;It was a job that had to be done.   I was asked to do it.  So I did.&#8217;  Feeling a deep reverence for this man and trying to find some closure in one of the most poignant encounters of my life, I offered, &#8216;I guess you&#8217;ve had a lot of things happen since then.&#8217;  &#8216;Yes, some good, some not-so-good.&#8217;  I asked him his name, and he said Tom Ferebee.  He went on to say that he, Tibbets, and the navigator on the Enola Gay, Captain Theodore Van Kirk, were friends, and the others on the crew had been assigned specifically for the bomb drop.  The three of them still stay in touch.   He added that he lived in Florida and was just in Atlanta visiting his daughter and granddaughter, who were with him in the store.  I shook his hand.  Ercanbrack (fellow missionary) didn&#8217;t believe me when I told him.  Later that rainy afternoon we drove to Emory University in Atlanta, looked up the atomic bomb, and saw a picture of a much younger crew of the Enola Gay.  There, grinning back, was Major Thomas Ferebee with black hair and a mustache.&#8221;  (pages 151-155)</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Of divine countenance and repose, here is &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; author Kevin Hickman Steadman on his beloved wife Mary Ann:  &#8220;When our (7) children were younger I marveled at how Mary Ann could lay one of our sick children in bed, in the bassinet or crib, gently covering him or her with a soft blanket and then lay down herself, quickly slipping into uninterrupted sleep though dogs could be barking and wild percussion instrumentals of thunder crashed wildly all around.  Yet with the slightest stir from the bassinet, she would bolt wide awake, attending to the needs of this child while I slept ignorantly on, not fully aware of the night&#8217;s activity.  In later years the roles reversed, with me being the fretting father of teenagers whose curfew had long since elapsed, mentally rehearsing terse speeches of chastisement and conjuring up merciless forms of penance and groundings to be levied the second they tried to slip through the front door, all while Mary Ann slept on.&#8221;  (page 163)</p>
<p>On oldest son Quinn&#8217;s death at age 19 in 1998 from a car accident:  &#8220;The night of Quinn&#8217;s death, and the nights that followed, Mary Ann was again able to find sleep while my mind thrashed like a broken cement mixer, trying to grasp the reality of not having him anymore.  With the funeral looming just a few days away, how do you say good-bye to your child, the little boy you watched grow up?  How can you go on?  How do you pay tribute to that which has given you purpose?  We have always taken slide pictures of family activities.  One of our family traditions at Christmas is to have the film developed that has been taken during the year and after our annual Christmas Eve shrimp dinner and the unwrapping of our traditional new pajamas, to show the slides on the wall of our living room while snacking on rich eggnog and goodies brought by the neighbors.  With nineteen years of pictures of Quinn, I thought of preparing a brief presentation of Quinn at his funeral, beginning with Mary Ann&#8217;s pregnancy and ending with the last pictures of him smiling, always smiling, in his black high school graduation cap and red gown &#8230;outside on the lawn after his commencement activities.  In recent years I have noticed my hearing seems to be off a few decibels (Kevin born Dec. 7 1953), especially when Mary Ann is talking to me.  Some of this loss may be due to the years of blasting music from the speakers in the car as I have driven through the desert or elsewhere, windows down, bass notes thumping from the car&#8217;s infrastructure, communing with me in the late dark or early morning hours as I wearily traveled home from a trip.  The music seldom varies&#8230; One song in particular from Rod Stewart&#8217;s cover of Bob Dylan&#8217;s &#8216;Forever Young&#8217; had moved me deeply one afternoon as I tumbled with the words and melody while driving through cactus and sand, thinking about my kids as the odometer rolled up the miles.  The tune bubbled to the surface of my mind quietly in the early hours of the morning after Quinn was killed, like the dollops of oil that ooze upward from the bowels of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor, where eleven hundred sailors are entombed.  Kam, (my only daughter) Shanda&#8217;s husband, also seemed to be having difficulty sleeping the nights following the accident, and together at the kitchen table we sifted through the archives of hundreds of slides of Quinn, selecting about seventy-five that in some way portrayed his life.  Some pictures jumped out, like the one of Mary Ann pinning his Arrow of Light badge on his blue Cub Scout shirt as he proudly stood at attention.  Another picture:  posing in front of the Piper Cherokee 140 on his sixteenth birthday, smiling in the bright sunlight reflecting off the December snow, tight black curls dangling, green parka unzipped to just above his waist for that surprise birthday flight when I got him out of school.  Timed with that image was Dylan&#8217;s lyric, &#8216;And when you finally fly away I&#8217;ll be hoping that I served you well&#8230;.&#8217;   Other pictures we tussled with:  reliving the occasion, what he said, what he was wearing, what had taken place.  I didn&#8217;t realize at the time, but in compiling this presentation, I was taking the first steps of a long, endless, solitary journey seeking peace, some form of closure, some way of saying good-bye to this oldest son&#8230;.  I had never attended a Mormon funeral where a slide presentation was shown.  No one had to tell me this was off the beaten path, grieving father or not.  The slide presentation in the kitchen had come together well, and I felt a sense of peace.  This was my last gift to Quinn, a final farewell.  The pictures were Quinn and his life.  The music was written from a father to his son.  It fit.  It was good&#8230;.  Gently, to a grieving father, the bishop said, &#8216;The chapel is generally not for slide presentations, particularly at a funeral&#8230;&#8217;   Feeling the Wild Bill in me begin to yawn and stretch, I replied, &#8216;It would mean a great deal to our family if we could do this, Bishop.&#8217;  The next day our bishop kindly called back&#8230; if we were certain it would be in good taste, and the music would be appropriate to play in a chapel, we could go ahead.  I like to think Quinn approved of his funeral.  We kept it all in the family, except for a prayer that was offered by his former scoutmaster and closing remarks customarily spoken by the bishop.  The slide presentation was all that I prayed it would be.  It was moving, dynamic, a portrayal of a life, a summation, a gift.  It was every feeling I wanted to convey to my son.  That it may have been inappropriate, I&#8217;ll leave to those who know better than I.  To me, it was more than just for those in attendance.  It was for Quinn.&#8221;   (pages 163-168)</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Thanks to great history sleuth Guenn Adare, Guenn showed me the old Papa&#8217;aloa sugar mill site at the cliffside bluff point about 800 ft. northeast [Hamakua direction] of the old mill store bldg.  Here the millhands saw the 1946 tsunami inundate Laupahoehoe Point &amp; carry its victims back out to sea.  The &#8220;smokestack&#8221; with a huge cylindrical gear on top of it is the derrick base for the crane operator, and this base sits on the bank/bench 200 ft. inland above the bluff point area.  The cliff knoll still higher in elevation than the derrick bench looks south [Hilo direction] down at the spit of land at sea level which is the old boat landing.  Papa&#8217;aloa stream cascades as a waterfall nearby.  A long-abandoned foot path buttressed by a concrete retaining cliff face wall descends toward the landing site.  Breathtaking for the long sheer vertical drop to the sea along most of this cliffside corridor, this bluff in its 4 shelved height levels shows Mother Nature in all her primal power, with the ocean waves banging against the cliff face far below where we stand and gaze in awe.

            <div class="comment"><p>Yes, Skill Camp Rd. [old Mamalahoa Hwy] north of the old Papa&#8217;aloa mill store had as its residents carpenters/machinists/welders/molders/plumbers/<br />
blacksmiths/etc.  It went north &amp; crossed the old HCR railway [today's Belt Rd.] &amp; went parallel to it just mauka of today&#8217;s Belt. Rd. [where the overpass is where cops catch speeders], &amp; here was the majestic plantation manager&#8217;s multi-acre estate mauka of the old highway.  The old highway then went north into a horseshoe turn around the little gulch &amp; emerged where today&#8217;s Laupahoehoe transfer station is.  Of course, today&#8217;s Belt Rd. bridge was constructed years before the actual Belt Rd. was built [to accomodate easier travel along the old Mamalahoa hwy][like how today's Honoli'i Belt. Rd. bridge was built in 1938 to accomodate easier travel along the old Mamalahoa hwy, &amp; later accomodated today's Belt. Rd. in 1951], so that you see the connector road from today&#8217;s Belt Rd. bridge on the other side of the gulch by the overpass north to where the school buses park by the Laupahoehoe swimming pool area.  Incredibly, erudite/sage Guenn Adare knows every square inch of the old plantation manager&#8217;s estate, along with the old Kihalani/Oshiro camp matchbox cottages lined like pearls on a string along the gulch [north-Hamakua direction of today's Belt. Rd. overpass] road which forks mauka of the old Mamalahoa hwy, along with the old mill site ocean cliffside bluffs, in that she does landscaping/property oversight for the owners of both the old plantation manager&#8217;s vast estate and the out-of-world experience cliffside bluff expanses [both areas owned by the same owners].  Amazing coincidence/confluence of vocation observation and archaeology finds.  Aloha, &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>From sagacious Kevin Hickman Steadman&#8217;s extraordinary &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; book:   &#8220;During the Civil War, a letter written by President Abraham Lincoln to the widowed mother of five sons believed to have been killed, Mrs. Lydia Bixby, gained the sympathy of a nation:  &#8216;Executive Mansion, Washington, Nov. 21, 1864 &#8212; Dear Madam, I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.  I feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming.  But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of a Republic they died to save.  I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.  Yours, very sincerely and respectfully, A. Lincoln.&#8217;    Ironically, the War Department had incorrectly informed President Lincoln.  Only two of her sons, Charles and Oliver, had died in battle, and Mrs. Bixby was later believed to be a sympathizer with the South.  Yet the grief a mother feels knows no uniform, no boundaries, no allegiance.  Unfortunately, no mistake was made on the morning of January 11, 1943, when a dark sedan from the War Department stopped in front of the home of Tom and Alleta Sullivan in Waterloo, Iowa, and three men in navy uniforms solemnly got out.  Tom, who was preparing to go to work at the railroad yard, invited the men in and knew the message they came to deliver could not be good.  &#8216;Which one?&#8217; he asked.  &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry.  All five,&#8217; replied Lieutenant Commander Truman Jones.  Just a year earlier on January 3, 1942, less than one month after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the five Sullivan brothers &#8212; George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, and Albert, with only a seven-year difference from George to Al &#8212; proudly strode into the local Navy recruiting station to offer their services to the United States of America.  Their decision to serve may have been to avenge the death of a friend who had died on the USS Arizona.  At that stage of the war the Navy was eager for recruits and gladly accepted the Sullivans, agreeing with the stipulation made by the brothers: &#8216;We stick together.&#8217;  On Valentine&#8217;s Day a month later, the USS Juneau, a light cruiser, was commissioned and the &#8216;fighting brothers&#8217; were part of the ship&#8217;s 698-man complement.  On Friday the 13th of November, 1942, the ship was torpedoed and damaged off the shores of Guadalcanal by a Japanese submarine.  Limping back for repairs the Juneau was hit again in the ammunition magazines by another submarine.  It exploded and sank quickly.  While most hands were immediately lost, some one hundred survivors, including George Sullivan, floated in the burning waters, suffering from the elements as well as from thirst, hunger, and shark attacks while calling out for Frank, Joe, Matt, and Al.  By the time a belated search was organized, eight days had passed and only ten crew members survived, none of whom were the Sullivan boys.  Security measures prohibited the Navy from announcing ships lost in battle to keep valuable information from falling into the hands of the enemy.  As the letters from the boys stopped coming, Alleta Sullivan became worried.  Rumors in town began to circulate that the Juneau had gone down.  With no official word, a very worried Alleta Sullivan wrote two months later in January 1943:  &#8216;Bureau of Naval Personnel &#8212; Dear Sirs, I am writing you in regards to a rumor going around that my five sons were killed in action in November.  A mother from here came and told me she got a letter from her son and he heard my five sons were killed.  It is all over town now, and I am so worried.  My five sons joined the Navy together a year ago, Jan. 3, 1942.  They are on the Cruiser, U.S.S. JUNEAU.  The last I heard from them was Nov. 8th. That is, it was dated Nov. 8th, U.S. Navy.  Their names are George T., Francis Henry, Joseph E., Madison A., and Albert L.  If it is so, please let me know the truth.  I am to christen the U.S.S. TAWASA, Feb. 12th, at Portland, Oregon.  If anything has happened to my five sons, I will still christen the ship as it was their wish that I do so.  I hated to bother you, but it has worried me so that I wanted to know if it was true.  So please tell me.  It was hard to give five sons all at once to the Navy, but I am proud of my boys that they can serve and help protect their country&#8230;  I am so happy the Navy has bestowed the honor on me to christen the U.S.S. TAWASA.  My husband and daughter are going to Portland with me.  I remain, Sincerely, /s/Mrs. Alleta Sullivan 98 Adams Street Waterloo, Iowa&#8217;<br />
Never having given death much thought before Quinn (my oldest son) died, I sort of thought that civilizations must have gotten used to losing citizens and family members during great tragedies.  Like Mrs. Bixby&#8217;s sons in the Civil War, the lists of casualties were published in the newspapers after the great battles.  In the battle of Gettysburg, which lasted just four days, almost eight thousand Confederate and Union soldiers were killed.  Surely, the mourning and loss of family members were tempered according to the times and reasons for death.  And what about the 1918 influenza, which possibly took up to fifty million souls worldwide, with 675,000 dying in the United States?&#8221;  (pages 186-191)</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>From loving and beneficent Kevin Hickman Steadman&#8217;s remarkably insightful &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; book:  &#8220;A quick glance at (elderly) Elsie&#8217;s great-grandparents&#8217; family group sheet (husband Alma &amp; wife Charlotte were married in 1852 &amp; marked 59 years of marriage at their deaths) startled me.  I noticed that eight of the sixteen children appeared to have died before the age of eight&#8230;Of these eight children, it was just Lullu who may have been stillborn; perhaps she breathed.  Five of the eight learned to walk and talk.  Martha, who was six, was probably a big help to her mother around the house, especially helping with the toddlers.  Looking at the other eight children listed in the family I thought I must be reading this wrong.  Two more children died as teenagers:  child #8, Willard, died at nineteen, the same age as Quinn (my son) when he was killed.  Francis Marian, child #12, a boy, died at fifteen.  Turning to Elsie, in almost a daze, I asked, &#8216;Elsie, is this right?  Did only six of the sixteen live to be adults?&#8217;  &#8216;That&#8217;s right.  Only Grandma and the boys Armond, George, Helaman, and Bill, and then Luella May.&#8217;  &#8216;How did they die?&#8217;   &#8216;There were accidents, sickness, and drownings.  It was really hard.&#8217;  Unlike Job (Biblical), the roof didn&#8217;t fall in and kill their ten children at once.  From 1855 to 1880, Alma and Charlotte buried babies, toddlers, and teenagers.  Having lost (oldest child) Alma in the cold of December 6, 1855, in Salt Lake City, was it any easier to bury Lullu, who died on July 20, 1880, in Leeds, Utah, twenty-five years later?  Did their mourning get easier?  Is there a way grieving becomes less painful as more children are buried?  Did the children become only names on a family group sheet and faded etched entities on modest horizontal headstones in the old section of the cemeteries, not warranting a large, slick granite monument of a life fully lived?  Alma and Charlotte continued on for another thirty years after the death of Lullu, marking fifty-nine years of marriage, yet carrying the memories of the children they outlived.&#8221;  (pages 193-195)</p>
<p>I, Curt, will never forget utterly beloved/sagacious Mormon missionaries Elder John Andrew born 1942 and his wife Sister Andrew born 1943, who, at their 16-month old daughter Jodi&#8217;s funeral, were &#8220;consoled&#8221; by attendees, &#8220;You have (7) other children, do not despair.&#8221;  Yikes!!</p>
<p>I will never forget &#8220;devout&#8221; Honoka&#8217;a Catholic J. Roy Souza born 1945, who, when remarking on the (killed in action &#8212; war) deaths of 2 of his combat brothers-in-arm, spouted, &#8220;It was their time to go.&#8221;   Yikes!!<br />
Never ever diminish death as &#8220;it was their time to go.&#8221;  Never!!  God&#8217;s Will/Ecclesiastes intone-evoke tribute/praise such as, &#8220;He was a good soldier (highest respect in combat parlance),&#8221; or &#8220;He is our hero, and always will be &#8212; I will never forget the example he set &#8212; he gave up his life to preserve our freedoms!&#8221;   But, as is the case with those who talk profusely but don&#8217;t think through what they say, these noiseboxes/talking heads will drop a one-liner such as &#8220;It was his time (to die)&#8221; or &#8220;You have many other children, do not despair&#8221; in their ignorance/insensitivity/callous lack of empathy-support-caring nature.   Sigh&#8230;     Love everlasting, &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>From compassionate and earthy Kevin Hickman Steadman&#8217;s &#8220;Gerbil Wheels&#8221; book:   &#8220;In the seclusion of my one-person office I work on a spacious heavy wooden desk, but I am confined to a seventeen by twenty-two inch white pad by baubles, gifts, talismans, and reminders of the bigger part of a life lived.  The walls market posters, pictures, and quotes, with no thought to organization or decor.  &#8220;Your taste has always been in your mouth, Kevin&#8221; (emphasis added)&#8230;. in a nook, perches an old black Panasonic tape-DVD-radio player turned to 100.3 FM, which I click on oldies, elevator music, with a remote.  Like the small perpetual water maze endlessly trickling between two plants in a window and a scented candle burning in front of me, the almost inaudible tunes play all day, providing life, movement, and company when I am in my office.  I do not hear the music; I cannot tell you what has played.  Yet like the exhausted mother with the sick infant, sleeping heavily until the child makes the slightest stir, I hear the first strains of Rod Stewart&#8217;s version of &#8220;Forever Young,&#8221; when it is broadcasted.  The first time I heard the song after Quinn&#8217;s funeral (my 19-year-old son), I automatically stood at my desk.  In the decade since his death I continue to stand when the tune is played.  There have been frenetic moments in my office at 3 a.m. running late to the airport for an early flight, trying to leave things in order, and I hear the song on the radio.  To stop and let everything go and stand and listen and look at his picture has never been an inconvenience or sacrifice &#8212; rather a privilege.  Every Monday morning on my way to work when in town, instead of going left at the stop sign, I turn right for several blocks and visit with Quinn.  At the time of his death, our city had just opened a new section of the cemetery south of the existing cemetery, and we could choose almost any burial plot.  There were fewer than ten headstones; now there are hundreds.  Some mornings I&#8217;ll leave the Altima idling when I walk to his grave; most mornings I turn off the ignition and stay longer.  When the honey locust trees bordering the cemetery were young, I could stand at his headstone and look up southeast at the face of Mr. Loafer and trace the route we hiked when he was fourteen, to the bowl just below the summit where we hunted deer.  Now, I have to shift my stance.  I don&#8217;t think my weekly visits to his grave through the years bestow any special feelings or esteem I have for Quinn that Mary Ann or others do not feel; perhaps it is a weakness in me.  Yet it is an easy thing to take the time and feel some closeness with this son.  I have ridden Sheeza (my horse)along the Highline Canal Road as it winds its way with the canal overlooking the farm lands and orchards and pulled her up short in the thick oak brush above the cemetery.  In the stillness of a bitterly cold December afternoon I sit quietly in the<br />
saddle and look down a steep, rugged hillside softened with deep snow, across a white vacant pasture and watch our neighbor, Karl, walk from his truck over a well-packed path of snow and stand before his wife Bonnie&#8217;s grave.  Impatiently, Sheeza stomps her front feet and the reins tug in my gloved left hand but we are undetected as steam mystically envelops us.  Karl&#8217;s coat is open, and I wonder if he is cold.  His lips move.  What is it that we say, Karl? (emphasis added)  Seventy-five yards to the west, and just a little north, is Quinn&#8217;s grave.  I can see the red kerosene lantern hanging on the shepherd&#8217;s crook next to the grey granite headstone.  The front of the marker reads &#8220;Quinn&#8221; in large scripted lettering while above, in smaller script:  &#8220;forever young&#8230;.&#8221;  (end of book)  (pages 231-234)</p>
<p>Curt&#8217;s note:  Thornton Wilder said that the highest tribute to the deceased is not grief but gratitude.  Oh so true&#8230; love everlasting, just as Eileen Elias Freeman intoned that angels caress the grieving, whispering softly that the beloved departed one is safe in the hands of God.  &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>interned WWII, buddaheads were Frank&#8217;s kazoku/family nemeses &#8212; fellow</p>
<p>buddaheads ignored/isolated the esteemed Arakawas from daily life &#8212; incl.</p>
<p>fear that they also would be interned/thrown into concentration camps if</p>
<p>they frolicked w/the Arakawas.   This stigma hurt the most, not internment/</p>
<p>other ethnic groups.  Frank was Kula Maui born U.S. citizen, not enemy alien,</p>
<p>but because he was the AJA leader who greeted Japan Navy vessels here,</p>
<p>he got interned.  So when Frank&#8217;s wife found out that she/trainload of kids</p>
<p>could join him, she took her kids to Sand Island O`ahu, where, to Frank&#8217;s</p>
<p>astonishment/shock, their whole clan was then shipped out to Jerome</p>
<p>Arkansas, where Frank led the internee council &amp; was ably assisted by Dem Party</p>
<p>germinator Ernie Mitsuo Kuwahara 1899-1982, optometrist who also was</p>
<p>locked up for greeting Japan navy vessels at Kuhio Pier/Hilo Bay.  Frank</p>
<p>certainly wanted to be w/his wife/loads of kids, but not to be shipped</p>
<p>out to nowhere land!   Frank&#8217;s wife, O`ahu native, told her kids, &#8220;shima</p>
<p>konjo!!&#8221;   Ergo, buddaheads here such small-minded islanders, small-thinking</p>
<p>gossipers w/nothing better to do than be idiotic noiseboxes talking small</p>
<p>talk about stupid nonsense ["I saw my friend Shigeo at the tofu shop, &amp;</p>
<p>he squawked about his constipation/stuck ass" -- "Let me tell you about</p>
<p>the stunts &amp; jokes Koshi used to pull on us at work!"].   Shima konjo!</p>
<p>Amazingly, Nisei Frank/Ernie Kuwahara/Sanji Abe/Frank Ishii/Tom Sakakihara</p>
<p>shrugged off their internment as &#8220;sh_t happens, brah&#8217;!&#8221;  Shoganai [no can</p>
<p>help -- forgive our captors].  But Issei/immigrant aliens were sore till their</p>

<p>never should&#8217;ve applied to American-born U.S. citizens, ergo our Nisei</p>
<p>AJAs!!   If anyone could&#8217;ve erupted in violence, it would&#8217;ve been our AJAs/</p>
<p>Nisei.  But no, our interned Issei were sore to the bone!!   I know why, because</p>
<p>our Issei overcompensated so much to demonstrate their loyalty to America &#8211;</p>
<p>TR Saiki/Hisato Isemoto [Isemoto Contracting] led our pre-Pearl Harbor</p>

<p>John Marshall the greatest [served 1801-1835].  Marbury v. Madison</p>
<p>1803 established judicial review [declared Congressional Act illegal].</p>
<p>Martin v. Hunter&#8217;s Lessee 1816 established U.S. S.Ct. review of</p>
<p>State ct. decisions.  McCulloch v. Maryland 1819 affirmed the</p>
<p>constitutional doctrine of Congress&#8217; implied powers [necessary</p>
<p>&amp; proper clause Art. I sec. 8 cl. 18]. </p>
<p>Fast forward to Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. U.S. 1911</p>
<p>which busted monopolies via Sherman Anti-trust Act [undue</p>
<p>restraint of trade].  Had our U.S. Atty. General been for the</p>
<p>little guy, we would&#8217;ve busted down our Big 5 oligarchy/cabal</p>
<p>which controlled every walk of life here, business &amp; otherwise.</p>
<p>Griswold v. Connecticut 1965 ruled that a state law prohibiting</p>
<p>the use/education of contraceptives violated the right of</p>
<p>marital privacy implied in the Bill of Rights.  Roe v. Wade 1973</p>
<p>ruled that regulation of abortion could begin no sooner than</p>
<p>about the end of the first trimester, w/increasing regs permissible</p>
<p>in the second &amp; third trimesters.  The State&#8217;s interest in</p>
<p>protecting the fetus was found to increase w/the fetus&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;capability for meaningful life outside the mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rust v. Sullivan 1991 ruled that Congress could prohibit</p>
<p>recipients of family-planning funds from providing/discussing</p>
<p>abortion as a family planning option.  This did not violate</p>
<p>the First Amdt. because clinics were still free to provide</p>
<p>such aid as a totally separate endeavor.  Planned</p>
<p>Parenthood v. Casey 1992 allayed anti-abortion forces</p>
<p>by allowing 24 hr. wait/required counseling/parental</p>
<p>consent for minors prior to fetal viability. </p>
<p>Cruzan v. Director Missouri Dept. of Health 1990 found that</p>
<p>via clear/convincing evidence of a person&#8217;s desire to</p>
<p>refuse med treatment/life support apparatus, the patient&#8217;s</p>
<p>wishes must be obeyed.</p>
<p>Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs 2003 ruled</p>
<p>that state gov&#8217;ts may be sued by their</p>
<p>employees for failing to honor the federally guaranteed</p>
<p>right to take time off from work for family emergencies.</p>
<p>Georgia v. Ashcroft 2003 ruled that race-sensitive</p>
<p>redistricting could consider more general minority influence</p>
<p>in the political process when drawing particular district</p>
<p>lines rather than addressing only the actual number of</p>
<p>minority voters present.</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Economic legislation &amp; traditional equal protection test</p>
<p>Where no fundamental right [voting/freedom of association] or</p>
<p>suspect criteria [race/national origin] is involved,  Courts defer</p>
<p>to economic legislation &amp; the legislative body need not articulate</p>
<p>its reasons for doing so.  The traditional equal protection test</p>
<p>applies that justifies disparate treatment.  But where fundamental</p>
<p>right or suspect criteria is involved, Courts require that the</p>
<p>disparate treatment/classification are necessary to promote some</p>
<p>compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly drawn to</p>
<p>be the least burdensome alternative possible.  What sets apart</p>
<p>the Hawai`i Superferry Supreme Court decision from the traditional</p>
<p>equal protection test is our State Constitution provision on preserving</p>
<p>our natural resources, in that Article XI Section 5 prohibits legislation</p>
<p>which favors a singular beneficiary that undercuts preservation of our</p>
<p>natural resources.  Esteemed political scientist Rick Castberg&#8217;s comment</p>
<p>on our Supreme Court&#8217;s Superferry decision is quoted here.  Thank you, &#8211;Curt</p>
<p>From Rick Castberg:</p>
<p>Lots of dicta, but bottom line is that the Supreme Court determined Act 2 is a &#8216;special law, violating Art. XI, sec. 5, of<br />
the Hawaii Constitution which states in part &#8220;The legislative power over the lands owned or under the control<br />
of the State and its political subdivisions shall be exercised only by general laws&#8230;.&#8221;   Act 2 was a special law<br />
because it favored, exclusively, the superferry by referring to &#8220;a large capacity ferry vessel,&#8221; which the Court<br />
determined created a class of one.  Other companies trying to qualify under that definition would not &#8220;receive the<br />
same rights and benefits granted to Superferry.&#8221;  Therefore, Act is a special law which violates the Hawaii<br />
Constitution.</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>State 442nd combat team president Willy Okino Thompson born 1924<br />
[my Dad's spiritual baby brother/my Dad Toshi 1913-1998]</p>
<p>Does a grunt/rifleman fairly judge his 36th Division 2 Star General</p>
<p>Dahlquist when the infantryman&#8217;s fate hangs in the balance?   To</p>
<p>a man, the 442nd RCT despises Dahlquist, dismissing Dahlquist as</p>
<p>reckless/careless/clueless based on Dahlquist&#8217;s field behavior-tactics</p>
<p>[most odious being the stranded Lost Battalion, that pushed too far</p>
<p>along &amp; had its supply/essential components cut off].   The 4 COs</p>
<p>most repulsed by Dahlquist are Pence [not judge Pence]/Shingles/</p>
<p>Hanley/Capt. Young Oak Kim.  In contrast, 34th Div. Gen. Charles W.</p>
<p>Ryder was cogent/smart.  Dahlquist&#8217;s aide Wells Lewis [Sinclair's son]</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t have to die &#8212; Dahlquist exposed Lewis to enemy fire.   Churchill</p>
<p>couldn&#8217;t stand Gen. Mark Clark, whom Churchill rejected as too cautious/</p>
<p>conservative.  But the AJA warriors cherished Clark.  What do these</p>
<p>varied views say about the 442/100th?    Clark was not reckless like</p>
<p>Dahlquist, nor audacious like Montgomery/Patton.  Like Ryder, Clark</p>
<p>was ever the pragmatist/sure-footed one.   A soldier&#8217;s General a la</p>
<p>Omar Bradley.  Breach Vosges by force the mantra, never happened</p>
<p>before.  The Nisei soldiers accomplished it.  More about them than</p>
<p>about Dahlquist.  Yet, Dahlquist got his 4th Star/medal-popper on</p>
<p>the lifeless backs of his 442/100th sacrificial lambs that he put out</p>
<p>to slaughter.  And Clark retired less dignified than Dahlquist.  Ironic.</p>
<p>Uncle Willy is in no position to explicate on Dahlquist&#8217;s failures as</p>
<p>General.  But Dahlquist, emblematic of medal-popper smugness/</p>
<p>conceit, has no support up the chain of command thruout the</p>
<p>Nisei RCT [incl. eventual 1st Batt. 100th].   I wish Uncle Willy&#8217;s</p>
<p>boys, however few in number today [most died of old age], focus</p>
<p>more on history &amp; less on ceremony/pomp-pageantry, which sicken</p>
<p>me because the 442 RCT gets inordinate publicity vis a vis other</p>
<p>veterans of all other wars.   My Dad was 442, so I&#8217;m not jealous</p>
<p>of the 442.  The problem w/our Sansei/kids of 442 veterans</p>
<p>is the kids&#8217; exaggerated idolatry of their realistically-flawed fathers.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the post-1920 born plantation Nisei soldiers got</p>
<p>pugnacious/arrogant with their newly-received high school diplomas,</p>
<p>unlike their older pre-1920 born brethren who were accomodationist/</p>
<p>willing subjects of benevolent paternalism of the Big Five oligarchy,</p>
<p>that enslaved these kids [incl. my Dad] to the menial planter</p>
<p>society hegemony by depriving them of schooling beyond the 8th</p>
<p>grade.  A Spark Matsunaga born 1916 typifies the non-rebuke</p>
<p>genre, whereas asshole Dan Inouye born 1924 typifies the</p>
<p>repudiatory militant asshole generation that received high school</p>
<p>diplomas.  Let&#8217;s be realistic, gang.  The 442 boys are not God.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re flawed, even more so [social climbers/status trippers]</p>
<p>than the rest of us.  The glare of publicity.   &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>Burns wanted a monument to himself in his back yard [Burns</p>

<p>never self-profited from politics.  Both men died broke [Burns</p>

<p>grumbled about how ordinary folks like Scrub could not keep</p>
<p>up with increased costs of Helco bills/insurance premiums/etc.].</p>
<p>An aside:  Scrub worried about what Gov. Burns was going to</p>
<p>do when the abortion bill came before him for signature &#8211;</p>
<p>Burns told Scrub, &#8220;I not going veto it, I no can let</p>

<p>just going let it become law without my signature.&#8221;     &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>Dept. of Interior&#8217;s Franklin Lane administered our newfound National Park Service in 1916</p>
<p>[President Woodrow Wilson], which  became popular [virginal land preservation/</p>
<p>conservation] as a maxim during Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s tenure [build up your lungs by breathing</p>
<p>fresh air -- TR was a sickly child w/bad asthma] a decade before.   If you recall, Franklin</p>
<p>Lane spoke to our prospective Honoka`a homesteaders back in 1918.</p>
<p>Ancient Rome&#8217;s public trust doctrine enables public use of waterways/shorelines [public</p>
<p>domain unrestricted by private ownership/cartels], antecedent to Bill Richardson&#8217;s same</p>
<p>doctrine [the berthed canoe which doesn't wash out to sea in the dead of night shall</p>
<p>define the public's site right over the shoreline][Richardson's nemesis Martin Pence, U.S.</p>
<p>Dist. Ct. jurist, accused Richardson of conjuring up Richardson's own law (vs. Anglo-Saxon</p>
<p>doctrine which sanctifies private ownership/fee simple land rights a la Brit individualist creed),</p>
<p>neither Pence nor Richardson citing ancient Roman law 2 millennia before].</p>
<p>Public Land Trust [or Trust for Public Lands--TPL] facilitates conservation/preservation of</p>
<p>pristine sites a la ancient Rome&#8217;s public trust doctrine over waterways/shorelines.  Public</p>
<p>Land Trust entails a consortium of interested entities who pool monies to acquire lands</p>
<p>for the public good/benefit in perpetuity.   This &#8220;hui&#8221; concept began taking root 38 yrs.</p>
<p>ago, but its seed was planted in ancient Rome via its public trust doctrine.</p>
<p>Gov. George Ariyoshi 1974-1986 actually galvanized proactive gov&#8217;t support for land</p>
<p>conservation a la Teddy Roosevelt/Woodrow Wilson&#8217;s Franklin Lane, &amp; George is really</p>
<p>the genesis of what you see today on all islands here [Pupukea/Puna Forest Reserve/</p>
<p>Maui conservation sites/etc.].   George activated the conservation</p>
<p>emphasis w/the State&#8217;s acquisition of Waiahole/Wai Kane [displaced farmers] 34 yrs. ago.</p>
<p>All of today&#8217;s positive signs [of conservation] point back to prescient  George. &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>Honomu village is 12 miles north of Hilo along the original King Sugar [Cane]</p>
<p>heritage corridor.  Its former C. Brewer-owned sugar mill 1880 stopped operations</p>
<p>in 1946 [merged w/Pepe`ekeo Sugar Mill].  King Kalani`opu`u was Kamehameha</p>
<p>the Great&#8217;s uncle &amp; war mentor.  After Kalani`opu`u died in 1782, Kamehameha</p>
<p>the Great went on to unite the Hawaiian Islands under his singular command.</p>
<p>Kalani`opu`u descendants include Kekulu Peleiholani 1854-1905, mother of David</p>
<p>Peleiholani Kalani Sr. 1879-1947.  Both mother/son are buried on Kalani estate</p>
<p>land south of Tanimoto estate [Tanimoto theater chain, not Akaka Noodle</p>
<p>Shop family].  Kalani High School in Wai`alae is not named after Kalani`opu`u, contrary to Wayne Subica&#8217;s statement, but after Prince Kuhio.</p>
<p>David Jr. was backyard musician w/pal/legend Gabby Pahinui.  David Sr. was Honomu</p>
<p>land baron, being headlined via nobility.</p>
<p>Sam Ho Chee born 1928, whose mother Hattie Kua was hanai&#8217;d by David Kalani Sr.,</p>

<p>Yes, diploma-laden Bill Westervelt  [B.A./B.Div./Doctor Divinity Oberlin (honor.)]</p>
<p>our foremost authority of Haw&#8217;n folklore into English.  Bill&#8217;s undiploma&#8217;d/unadorned</p>
<p>esteemed peer nonpareil on Haw&#8217;n culture/health care/anthropology was intrepid</p>
<p>translator Theodore Kelsey, self-taught man.  Both Westervelt/Kelsey immersed</p>
<p>completely via manuahi avocations on Hawaiiana.   My kupuna June Gutmanis 1925-</p>
<p>1998 like my Dad &amp; like her kupuna Theodore Kelsey, no college education [my Dad only</p>
<p>completed 8th grade].   But to me Kelsey/Gutmanis/my Dad were steeped in life</p>
<p>learning/self-educated.   &#8220;Hea&#8221; we say,</p>
<p>eh, no tink you betta&#8217; jus&#8217; cause you get diploma.     Nonetheless, June Gutmanis was</p>
<p>cantankerous Theodore Kelsey&#8217;s devoted protege&#8217;  &#8212; &amp; Kelsey taught her well,</p>
<p>because non-diploma June is the blockbuster author of integral bks. Na Pule</p>
<p>Kahiko [ancient prayers]/Kahuna La`au Lapa`au [herbal medicine]/Pohaku</p>
<p>[stones], not to mention scribed for Nat&#8217;l Geographic/Readers Digest.  Born</p>
<p>in Nebraska like cornhusker Swede Steve Christensen, June came up the</p>
<p>hard way, even being WWII pilot.  Straight-shooting/plain-speaking [not small</p>
<p>talk] like &#8216;dem curmudgeon Appalachia hillbillies/Scot-Irish toughies.  June Gutmanis</p>
<p>taught me all I know about HUMAN NATURE, a la sensible/pragmatic non-judgmental</p>
<p>Ka`u Mary Pukui &amp; her AJA daughter Patience Namaka Bacon.  June spoke</p>
<p>of listening to Kelsey emote about Queen Lili`u&#8217;s timeline/life maturation</p>
<p>&amp; how intolerant/grandiose throne-pusher Lili`u blew her own monarchy</p>
<p>right out of the tranquil Pacific Ocean, only to regret her arrogance</p>
<p>after it was too late [post-1893 overthrow].  </p>
<p>Clearly, a Disraeli/King Solomon she was not!   See, &#8216;dis not about emperor/</p>
<p>empress worship like &#8216;da 442 kids/3rd generation-sansei flatulently bespeak</p>
<p>[pilau smell] glorified b.s. of their realistically flawed fathers.  Like today&#8217;s b.s.</p>
<p>drivel about realistically flawed Lili`u, 442 b.s. just as bad.  Kelsey/Gutmanis got</p>
<p>me grounded to reality here.  Pono, baby.  I love you June, just as you love</p>
<p>Kelsey kupuna up above.   Sadly for me, June/my Mom Teruko 1916-1998</p>
<p>died w/n 2 weeks of each other [June fatal heart attack/Mom fatal stroke], &amp;</p>
<p>my Dad Toshi 1913-1998 died just 4 months after them [pancreatic cancer].</p>
<p>Mo`o ali`i  &#8212; they are my lifeblood throne-bearers in my eyes till this very day.</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Western culture &#8212; everybody&#8217;s equal</p>
<p>Bks. of Daniel/Revelation show the metamorphosis of Christianity.</p>
<p>Just as Old Testament&#8217;s David/Noah/Abraham emoted the God</p>
<p>of Love, so did Peter/Paul transition from Old Testament fire/</p>
<p>brimstone to New Testament peace/goodwill to all.  Thru</p>
<p>such sequences, we come to know that everybody&#8217;s equal before </p>
<p>God.  Which is why the hegemonic pharisees persecuted Jesus.  </p>
<p>Fast forward to William of Normandy who became King of England</p>
<p>in 1066 A.D., who ruled via feudalism, but such baron knight</p>
<p>crusades bankrupted the monarchy, which resulted in the</p>
<p>Magna Carta in 1215 A.D., that guaranteed the rights of</p>
<p>freemen [but in fact limited the King's power to protect the</p>
<p>rights of barons].  The Anglican Church resulted from Henry</p>
<p>VIII&#8217;s repudiation of the Pope&#8217;s refusal to allow Henry to</p>
<p>divorce in 1540.  Of course, the &#8220;divine right of kings&#8221;</p>
<p>creed thereafter resulted in the outbreak of England&#8217;s</p>
<p>Civil War in 1642 &amp; divine king Charles I&#8217;s execution in 1649.</p>
<p>Such liquidation of divinity stemmed from Elizabeth I&#8217;s Poor</p>
<p>Law signalling government relief for the destitute in 1601,</p>
<p>also fueling grassroot jury trial redux [intro'd by Normans</p>
<p>in 1066 A.D.][1670 trial of Quakers William Penn/Mead known</p>
<p>as jury foreman Bushell's Case that established independent</p>
<p>jury verdicts unmoved by abusive elitist judges]. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, our American Revolution was caused by our</p>
<p>colonial repudiation of Monarchal economic exploitation.</p>
<p>France followed suit in 1789 via incendiary Voltaire/Rousseau</p>
<p>[both of whom died in 1778, right after the American</p>
<p>Revolution].  But Marx&#8217; seeds of communism [public's</p>
<p>ownership of means of production--land/labor/capital--</p>
<p>vs. feudalism's control by landowners; vs. capitalism's</p>
<p>control by investors; vs. socialism's control by</p>
<p>laborers] resulted in 2 epochal genocides unmatched</p>
<p>a century ago &#8212; Stalin&#8217;s purges/Mao&#8217;s &#8220;cultural</p>
<p>revolution&#8221; &#8212; which did nothing but concentrate power</p>
<p>in a supertyrant/despot, destroying each society&#8217;s</p>
<p>social progress/aspirations.  USSR disintegrated</p>
<p>via economic collapse in 1991, &amp; Red China has</p>
<p>incorporated capitalism to shore up its economy.</p>
<p>Communism as precept never fulfilled itself in reality.</p>
<p>Everybody&#8217;s equal via the American Dream, rooted</p>
<p>firmly in antiquity via Scripture.  We are reminded</p>
<p>via Matthew/Isaiah, &amp; via Francis of Assisi/Erasmus</p>
<p>of our Social Gospel.  Alms-giving/Divine Grace a</p>
<p>la King David/Jerusalem 1000 B.C.    &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Terry Shima/discouragement a part of life ["if it ain't about 442, forget it!"]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad that Terry Shima chose not to go public w/Terry&#8217;s experiences w/Uncle</p>
<p>Jesse Shima.  I propagated Terry&#8217;s anecdote on Jesse before Terry pulled back on it.  So goes the</p>
<p>untold legacy of Jesse Shima.  Terry is a Laupahoehoe buddahead who was WWII</p>
<p>conscript/then to Georgetown, &amp; to foreign service.  Terry&#8217;s 442 &#8220;JAVA&#8221; story is an</p>
<p>&#8220;oracle&#8221; all its own, but my focus solely is on Jesse, whose crossroad in history is unmatched.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about the fullness of time.  The theme [even if one dabbles in Scripture]</p>
<p>is everybody&#8217;s equal, which Jesse&#8217;s life personifies.   Ted Tsukiyama is the very one who extolled</p>
<p>about the legacy of River St. Church.  His dad/okasan attended it, Dan Inouye&#8217;s okasan</p>
<p>met Dan&#8217;s otosan there, &amp; &#8220;the rest is history,&#8221; so to speak.   My upshot on Ted&#8217;s militant</p>
<p>buddaheads [unlike on shin Issei Jesse Shima] is that in being born 1920/thereafter, this</p>
<p>outfit was able to graduate from high school [thanks to DPI egalitarian Oren Long post-</p>
<p>1934], unlike my otosan&#8217;s generation [my otosan born 1913/Wainaku mill villager/plantation</p>
<p>kids stopped at the 8th grade].  Ted&#8217;s gang&#8217;s high school diplomas set that gang on its audacious</p>
<p>run into history [442/GI Bill/Statehood/extraordinary leadership-mentorship].  My heart</p>
<p>rests w/the generation that had it much harder, my otosan&#8217;s gang.   &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>Dean Acheson 1893-1971 as Tory [Cold War architect a la George Keenan]</p>
<p>actually was villified by maniac Joe McCarthy/Whig, for not coming down</p>
<p>hard enough on Commies/Reds.  In reality, if Stalin had not shown Stalin&#8217;s</p>

<p>Acheson lifelong Democrat, though perceived as Tory by McCarthyites.</p>

<p>Opposite of what you think.  Born in Bethlehem, Jesus was raised in Nazareth</p>
<p>&amp; there he spoke of hope, not doom &#8212; &#8220;good news to the common soul &#8212; release</p>
<p>the oppressed, this year of our Lord&#8217;s favor.&#8221;  Luke 4:18-19   In turn, Jesus got</p>
<p>shouted down, &amp; the mob tried to hurl Jesus off the brow of the hill to the cliff</p>
<p>below.  Jesus then lamented that no prophet is accepted in his hometown.  Luke</p>
<p>4:24   Earl Finch is the tragic exemplar &#8212; Earl befriended the British/AJA infantrymen</p>
<p>who trained at Camp Shelby Miss.  Earl&#8217;s Hattiesburg citizens railed into him, &#8220;Why</p>
<p>do you go overboard to help these guys?  They&#8217;re not even from our country!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Earl responded, &#8220;We&#8217;re all on the same side.  Why shouldn&#8217;t I help them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Earl was run out of town, an outcast among his own people.  Just like Jesus said.</p>
<p>442 John Tsukano 1924-2005 is the bitter pill for his fellow 442 boys &#8212; his boys</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t know what to make of Tsukano&#8217;s mission to chronicle their history.  After</p>
<p>all, former swim titlist Tsukano was a promoter/entrepreneur [great friend of Hilo's</p>
<p>Richard Pablo Chinen], &amp; his 442 boys thought he was trying to sell them</p>
<p>something.  Why they didn&#8217;t get leery about Yempuku if they were leery of</p>
<p>Tsukano is because Yempuku was their sempai/older brother via VVV roots.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Tsukano&#8217;s &#8220;Bridge of Love&#8221; book is the greatest history of the</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Rudy Peterson/Hung Wai Ching ["HW"]</p>
<p>Rudy Peterson 1904-2003<br />
Hung Wai Ching 1905-2002<br />
Masaji Marumoto 1906-1995<br />
Hung Wo Ching 1912-1996</p>
<p>Rudy Peterson paved the way for Oriental land developers to finance their projects through the Bank of Hawaii.  This was a watershed economic opportunity that paved the way for the Orientals to become major Hawaii tycoons.  Unfortunately, the tycoons took all the credit for being brilliant without giving credit to a rare (good luck) opportunity after the war and the generous credit extended by Peterson.</p>
<p>Rudy was a buddy of Hung Wai ["HW"] and was instrumental in enabling HW to create the huge subdivisions in Aiea, Pearl City and Waipahu known as developments of Pacific Land Hui. It helped that HW knew the Amfac people who sold him the land.  Pacific Land Hui was a limited partnership headed by HW as general partner and a bunch of AJA contractors who were his “boys” at one time or other as limited partners.  All made bundles of money as demand far exceeded supply after the war. The engineers were Sunn Low Tom &amp; Hara; Takushi Okamura was the attorney and the accountant was another Buddahead whose name escapes me (later Coopers Lybrand I think). Oahu Homes was the sales agent and was run by some of HW’s “boys.&#8221;  No one had to hustle for sales in those days because buyers lined up to purchase the “package deals” which had just emerged in those days as an evolution of subdivided land. The first phase sold for $14,000 for a 3 BR home (no sidewalks and overhead utilities). The second phase sold for $17,000.  HW was really riding high in those days.</p>
<p>Masaji Marumoto was on BoH Bd. of Directors, &amp; followed Hung Wo Ching under Peterson. Masaji represented</p>
<p>Chinn Ho w/Wai&#8217;anae resort plans [after sugar plantation closed down], which is how H-1 Freeway got thru<br />
via federal funds [Heco plant/etc.].  BoH&#8217;s Cooke aristocratic persona was diffused via Peterson&#8217;s grassroot</p>
<p>image.  BoH&#8217;s Link Moore a grassroot acolyte.  Luso/Portuguese Joe Pao 1916-1977 w/BoH [great CPA Henry</p>
<p>Alves under Pao].  Pao&#8217;s greatest project was utterly creative Enchanted Lakes.  &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>Maui-born, O`ahu-raised Rich Sakakida 1920-1996 is MIS&#8217; greatest hero.  Plucked</p>
<p>straight out of McKinley High 1939 by Gen. MacArthur, Rich posthumously was</p>
<p>awarded the Distinguished Service Medal 11 yrs. ago.  Rich preceded</p>
<p>the 100th Batt./442 by 3+ yrs.  Which is why his story only gathers dust among our</p>
<p>AJA soldiers.  Rich&#8217;s timeline reads like all adventure epics thrown into one lifetime.</p>
<p>Rich goes undercover for MacArthur, gives up his seat to buddahead civie when</p>
<p>MacArthur orders Rich to evacuate after Fall of Bataan.  Rich gets tortured by</p>
<p>infamous Jap Kempei Tai secret police, commandeers prison breakout of 500</p>
<p>PI guerrilla soliders, gets shot &amp; goes into hiding in jungle till rescued by fellow</p>
<p>U.S. soldiers.   Suffers incredible war wounds, but goes on to live till 1996.</p>
<p>Rich&#8217;s superhuman heroics stayed secret until 1978 [Army classified].  He gets</p>
<p>enshrined in MIC HoF in 1988.  He&#8217;s posthumously awarded DSM in 1998.  What</p>
<p>an amazing/death-defying bio.   Thru it all, he credited his mother for his stoic</p>
<p>resolve.   His dad died when he was 7, leaving his mom to care for her whole</p>
<p>tribe of kids.  On the other hand, as we honor Abraham Lincoln on his 200th</p>
<p>birthday anniversary [Hilo's Lincoln Park was created on Lincoln's centennial</p>
<p>1909], Honest Abe lost his mother as a child, revulsed at his tyrannical dad,</p>
<p>which is why Lincoln had affinity for slaves&#8217; plight.    &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>Gotta reprise Franklin Odo&#8217;s blockbuster book &#8220;No Sword to Bury,&#8221; wherein Herb Isonaga<br />
1921-2009 chafes at Herb&#8217;s VVV college peers who inflate their role in forming the eventual</p>
<p>442 RCT.  Herb flatly retorts that the VVV was just a gimmick to show our mettle/AJA patriotism</p>
<p>to America, that the boys were in the right place/time aka &#8220;fortune of circumstance.&#8221;  Apt/true. </p>
<p>After appearing before the Sanhedrin, Bible&#8217;s Stephen is taken outside &amp; stoned to death.  Twist is that</p>
<p>Paul of Tarsus, violent Christian persecutor, approves stoning of Stephen for blasphemy.  Yes, this is</p>
<p>the subsequent St. Paul the apostle/ardent defender of the Christian faith.   Stephen is my Herb,</p>
<p>who is outnumbered by the monoshiri/talking heads among the infant post-1920 born Varsity Victory</p>
<p>Volunteers AJAs [DPI/DOE chief Oren Long 1934-1946 was our greatest educator/altruist who busted</p>
<p>Big 5 repression of rural kids to stay on plantations by denying them schooling beyond the 8th grade--</p>
<p>Long opened up prep schools in rural hamlets that gave post-1920 born kids audacity/self-confidence</p>
<p>via kids' high school diplomas-- these were the VVVs of Herb's gang -- high-nosed "cream of the crop"</p>
<p>unlike their older, humbler, &amp; wiser pre-1920 born generation of Nisei/AJAs, such as the 100th Batt. boys</p>
<p>born 1918 &amp; earlier, 100th being original 298-299 National Guard conscripts]. </p>
<p>Paul of Tarsus typifies the VVV of the educated high-collared Sanhedrin.  You know,</p>
<p>life is strange.  Ever since our greatest AJA historian Franklin Odo born 1939 published &#8220;No Sword to</p>
<p>Bury&#8221; [we are Americans, not Japs], nary any 442/VVV commended poor Franklin [they're too much</p>
<p>into their own legend], except Sanhedrin Ted Tsukiyama, who recognizes Odo&#8217;s</p>
<p>book as great history.   The post-1920 born 442nd boys love themselves too much, &amp; get caught up in</p>
<p>their own press clippings.  Franklin, I know their ilk way better than you do.  Keep up the faith [history for time</p>
<p>immemorial].  Love, &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>Naniwa literally means &#8220;what indeed!!&#8221; [a sight to see!!]  Naniwa is the</p>
<p>ancient nerve center of commerce in Japan 1,500 yrs. ago, which is today&#8217;s</p>
<p>Osaka.  It is in Western Japan, meaning Kansai [western part], whereas</p>
<p>today&#8217;s Tokyo is in Eastern Japan, meaning Kanto [eastern part].  Naniwa</p>
<p>is the most magical word in Nipponese because it symbolizes great power/</p>
<p>strength, which is why Japan&#8217;s Navy that defeated China/Russia a century</p>
<p>ago [that incited Japan's imperialism that resulted in the Pearl Harbor attack]</p>
<p>was led by its battleship Naniwa.  Which is why the Naniwa baseball team</p>
<p>here that won the jr. baseball title 1907 had its flag unfurled as Naniwa</p>
<p>1881, when the battleship was conceived [but built in Britain].   Our Nippon</p>
<p>immigrants came from Kansai/Western Japan, thus geographical affinity.</p>
<p>Waiakea/Yashijima Naniwa team 1930s of the Hilo Japanese baseball league</p>
<p>is named after this fairyland word.  Interestingly, even today we AJAs have</p>
<p>no clue what the names on our sports uniforms mean.  My Wainaku Meisho</p>
<p>team uniform stood for perennial titlists, but to this day I don&#8217;t know what</p>
<p>Meisho means, except that Meishoin Church is in Hilo, not Wainaku [had our</p>
<p>Jodo sect church].  If our pidgin definition is the same as the Japan</p>
<p>dictionary version, then meisho means called upon to serve.   The 1907</p>
<p>Naniwa baseball squad consisted of later great civic leaders Futoshi Frank</p>
<p>Arakawa pitcher/Hisakichi Hisanaga catcher/TR Saiki-Jack Fujii&#8217;s grandpa</p>

<p>supported GOP Felix after Felix returned to Hilo [&amp; Felix' transfer as circuit judge from</p>

<p>It was one of the best books I ever read.  Reading about how he took care of and moved in his Filipino stepfather (who never realized Ben knew the truth of who his &#8220;biological&#8221; father was) reminded me of my maternal filipino grandmother (from the same generation) moving in with me and me taking care of her.  All of the little habits this old tata had brought back memories of my grandma. </p>
<p>When I was enlightened to this fact in the book, my opinion of Cayetano changed and I was never a fan of beforehand.</p>
<p>But, I don&#8217;t think he turned his back on his heritage and upbringing but more moved in a different direction and changed with all of his career responsibilities. </p>
<p>That is one of the reasons he and his first wife ended up separating.</p>

<p>    Bob was just feted w/tremendous humanitarian award, long overdue/deserved to no end.</p>
<p>    Bob&#8217;s mom is Ruth Richards Midkiff, whose mom is Big 5 godfather Frank Atherton&#8217;s older</p>
<p>    sister, whose mom is C&amp;C co-founder Amos Starr Cooke&#8217;s daughter.  Bob&#8217;s uncle is</p>
<p>    Atherton Richards, who sent/sponsored Anson Chong to Punahou.  Bob&#8217;s great grand-uncle</p>
<p>    is Charles Montague Cooke, son of Amos Starr Cooke.  Charles co-founded Lewers &amp;</p>
<p>    Cooke [lumber/bldg. supply].  Bob&#8217;s dad Frank Midkiff 1887-1983 came from genesis</p>
<p>    of modern service to community [Lions/Rotary/Exchange/Kiwanis/Elks/Chicago's Edgar</p>
<p>    Robinson became 1st Boy Scout director/Billy Sunday's Prohibition 1919] Midwest,</p>
<p>    Illinois, in 1913, was buddaheads&#8217; greatest supporter, went to bat for us as soon</p>
<p>    as he landed, started all-buddahead Co. D Hawai`i National Guard WWI, was biggest</p>
<p>    supporter of Takie Okumura&#8217;s New Americans Conferences [along w/genesis</p>
<p>    &amp; Okumura mentor Frank Atherton &amp; C&amp;C co-founder Samuel N. Castle's son</p>
<p>    William Richards Castle 1849-1935 (no relation to Bob Midkiff's Richards ohana),</p>
<p>    who bankrolled Doshisha U. Japan &amp; whose son Alfred L. Castle 1884-1972</p>
<p>    was an influential asst. secretary of state for Far Eastern Affairs in D.C.].</p>
<p>    No denying, Bob&#8217;s dad also was huge supporter of Hawaiians, prexy KS</p>
<p>    1923-1934, BE trustee 1939-1983 [succeeded grassroots Dick Trent 1917-1939</p>
<p>    both died in office].   Bob Midkiff was longtime godfather of trusts/</p>
<p>    profit-sharing here, actually started profit-sharing w/Haw&#8217;n Trust Co. [mentor</p>
<p>    was curmudgeon/fatherly Herb Ware Camp], &amp; later headed parent co. of</p>
<p>    American &amp; Bishop Trust Cos.   Yes, Midkiff roots are Danish [hard scrabble/</p>
<p>    no-nonsense], but have Haw&#8217;n blood here.  Interestingly, Bob told me to</p>
<p>    squash racial praise of him as champion of us buddaheads [Bob always</p>
<p>    enabled/supported buddahead orgs/causes] when Bob ran for BOE.   Like</p>
<p>    Jesus [Samaritans], Bob believes that focus on race/ethnicity fuels strife/</p>
<p>    discord w/out primary emphasis on pluralism/diversity.  Great lesson.  BOJaps stigma.</p>
<p>    BTW, both Frank Atherton&#8217;s dad Joseph Ballard Atherton 1837-1903 &amp;</p>
<p>    W.R. Castle above supported Sun Yat Sen&#8217;s democratic revolution in China.</p>
<p>    Yes, these are larger than life Bob Midkiff&#8217;s roots/backdrops.   Bob still is</p>

<p>    Buddhism dismisses the duality of mind/body, Creator/created, asserting that &#8220;self&#8221; is the problem [personification/<br />

Paul, such a gentle/mild-mannered/tender soul.   Paul was heartbroken for many years<br />

            <div class="comment"><p>No referendum to annexation</p>
<p>The grassroot population did not vote for/against annexation.   No, it was not popular<br />
will.    Annexation by joint resolution of Congress was used to annex Texas &amp; then<br />
Hawai`i in 1898.  The only measure of popular participation is after the fact, when<br />
our territorial solons, including our delegates to Congress, promoted Statehood.<br />
In 1893, ethnic Hawaiians constituted 40% of the population, but their voting age<br />
base was lower, because most Asian immigrants were adults.  In Lili`u&#8217;s 1893 domain,<br />
75% of ethnic Hawaiians were denied suffrage because of gender/literacy/<br />
property/age requirements.  But because of the racial disenfranchisement of Asian<br />
immigrant adults, ethnic Hawaiians still amounted to two-thirds of the electorate for<br />
representatives &amp; one-third for Nobles.  Dole&#8217;s Republic&#8217;s Constitution removed the<br />
express racial exclusion of Asian immigrants from suffrage which Lili`u had forced,<br />
but because Asian immigrants could not be naturalized  [such Congressional<br />
prohibition predated annexation, e.g. Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882],  ethnic<br />
Hawaiians remained the majority of the electorate all the way up thru the<br />
1930s [up to just before WWII]!!   Chinese were allowed citizenship in 1943,<br />
Filipinos in 1946, &amp; Japanese in 1952.   In 1930 Asians accounted for two-thirds<br />
of the overall population but only one-quarter of adult citizens.   % of AJA voters in<br />
relation to overall voting population rose from one-tenth in 1926 to one-quarter in<br />
1936.   Thence practical/prescient Joe Farrington&#8217;s co-optation of the auspicious/<br />
growing Asian/AJA voting bloc come 1942 [Joe's inaugural election as delegate to<br />
Congress].   But irrefutably, the Trasks/Heens propagated suffrage in martial law<br />
Hawai`i to rid `Iolani Palace &amp; county supervisors of J_ps [like Hilo solons Sanji<br />
Abe/Tommy Sakakihara/Hilo Bd. of Supvsrs.' Frank Ishii].    Yes, the benevolent<br />
Big 5/haole oligarchy [Joe Farrington was Star-Bulletin owner/GOP]  were more<br />
sympathetic to us than our favored Hawaiians.   Akin to Disraeli&#8217;s unison/merger<br />
of England&#8217;s upper class w/its lower class vs. the intermediate middle class/populace<br />
power brokers a century before Joe Farrington &amp; indubitable Asian galvanizers<br />
Hung Wai Ching/Shigeo Yoshida, native-born Hawai`i citizens.   Yes, our Asian<br />
allies consisted of our haole GOPs.  Our tormentors were the anomalous &#8220;gang of<br />
one&#8221; Democratic Party&#8217;s Trask/Hawaiian cronies.   Yikes.  Opposite of what you<br />
think.   Dems as party of the unwashed?   No way.   My heroes are Big 5 oyabun/GOP<br />
godfather Frank Atherton [1878-1945]  &amp; Charles Hemenway 1875-1947 [Ted Tsukiyama's<br />
genro/elder statesman].   Hung Wai Ching/Kats Kometani/Mas Marumoto eventually<br />
became Statehood Joe Farrington&#8217;s holy trinity [after Kats/Mas returned from WWII<br />
all-Nisei combat duty/after Hung Wai gloriously stepped down as all-Nisei boys'<br />
messiah/patron saint]/kitchen cabinet.     &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>If the Monarchy/Lili`u were restored in 1893</p>
<p>Nationalist Lili`u would&#8217;ve counted on European powers to offset the U.S. advantage<br />
[of geographical proximity as opposed to other world powers].   Just as Jack Burns<br />
invoked 70 yrs. later, Lili`u would&#8217;ve exhorted her race to defy its inferiority of spirit,<br />
its ideology of defeat/failure.   Lili`u&#8217;s problem was her pa`akiki utterly stubborn<br />
nature a la today&#8217;s imperialist/Prexy George Bush.   Thurstonites run her off her throne, so<br />
she decides to avenge herself to her delight by declaring their beheading, which brought<br />
down the house in international circles, w/world press having a field day off her visceral<br />
absurdity.   A Disraeli/Gladstone of equanimity she was not.   Lili`u eventually learned to be<br />
more collaborative, to use intermediaries to class up to international calibre, &amp; to accept<br />
the inevitability of social/economic change on a global scale [importation of cheap labor/<br />
immigration].   Kamehameha III [Kauikeaouli], longest-reigning monarch, 1825-1854,<br />
was far superior to closed-minded Lili`u, he being magnanimous/prescient in transforming<br />
Kamehameha the Great&#8217;s feudal rule into a constitutional monarchy based on ideas of<br />
law and democracy inspired by England and America.  His 1840 Constitution which<br />
incorporated the Declaration of Rights invoked the common law maxim that the King<br />
must not be under man but under God and under the law because law makes the<br />
King.  As Rex v. Booth [1863, 2 Haw. 616, 630] intoned,  Kamehameha III<br />
originally possessed, in his own person, all the attributes of absolute sovereignty.<br />
Of his own free will, he granted the Constitution of 1840, as a boon to his<br />
country and to his people, establishing his Government upon a declared plan.<br />
Yes, his Constitution introduced the grassroot glory of representatives chosen by<br />
the people &#8212; for the first time  ever, the common lot shared in actual political power &amp;<br />
in government &#8211;  common provision come alive!!    Contrast Kamehameha III w/Lili`u &#8211;<br />
in January 1893 she triggered chaos/anarchy by forcing  her new constitution by royal<br />
fiat, adding fuel to the forces of coup d`etat.  Little Caesar Lili`u asserted royal power to<br />
abrogate and grant constitutions/unhinge elementary stability of checks/balances, force<br />
her absolute veto at will, appoint most solons, exercise absolute autocracy over all<br />
subjects of the Kingdom, from peasants/maka`ainana-hoa`aina to cabinet ministers/etc.<br />
She would have disenfranchised many voters by reprising property qualifications on<br />
voting for representatives and by denying suffrage to everyone else.   Lili`u&#8217;s own<br />
cabinet refused to support her absolute tyranny/iron fist.  Thus, Lili`u&#8217;s megalomania/<br />
absolute autocracy precipitated today&#8217;s  cult of inferiority/failure/victimization promoters<br />
[UH-Manoa Haw'n Studies gang/OHA/KS/etc.].   Whoa is me cultists propagandize<br />
exploitation/superiority vs. non-Haw&#8217;ns a la slave traders.   Are we not common subjects a la<br />
Kamehameha III?    Or are we second class people based on our immutable bloodline?   Equal/<br />
common provision make no exception based on diverse origin/genesis.   The Hawaiian<br />
Nation is not about race.  It is about nationhood.   Equal subjects/citizens, equal<br />
respect/treatment.   Had Lili`u gone on as absolute ruler,  her totalitarian fist-choke<br />
would have been ended violently  by revolution from everyone  but her throneroom<br />
retainers.   Yes, everyone.   Violence begets violence.   Beheading to avenge like Lili`u  leads<br />
to anarchy/removal of fundamental respect for social cohesion/governance.   Lili`u was<br />
forced to soften her approach to diplomacy by the reality of equal provision/common sense.<br />
Yes, she was not a good ruler/leader.    But she is Hawaiian.    So what?   Nationhood is<br />
about leadership/common provision, not absolute tyranny a la sad exemplar  Lili`u.   Visualize<br />
this, in light of today&#8217;s hewa hatists/fearful avariceists Trasks/Osorio/etc., our 442nd boys<br />
would&#8217;ve been guerrilla soldiers taking down `Iolani Palace.   Not a pleasant thought.  Had<br />
Lili`u been restored.<br />

<p>Kanaka Barney Joy 6&#8217;0 225 lbs. was 25 yrs. old by the time he &amp; best</p>
<p>friend Charlie En Sue Pung 1880-1944 were recruited to Stateside pro</p>
<p>ball.  Pung declined to go because of Pung&#8217;s burgeoning family [later swim</p>
<p>star son Barney Joy Pung 1919-1978 married golf legend Jackie Liwai]. </p>
<p>Barney Joy&#8217;s kids became great athletes, incl. namesake &#8220;Jr.&#8221; 1907-</p>
<p>2001 who went on to be a multi-sport icon [&amp; for whom Sr. got</p>
<p>homesick &amp; forsook further Stateside play 1907].  Baseball-fever.com</p>
<p>amps the mania surrounding the color line vs. Barney Joy 1907.</p>
<p>Bronze-skinned Joy was thought to be &#8220;Malay&#8221; &amp; of dark Negro color,</p>
<p>&amp; thus ineligible for big league play.  Irony is that Joy is distant cousin</p>
<p>of baseball founder Alex Joy Carwright, who settled in Honolulu &amp; became</p>
<p>fire station boss/library founder.  Cartwright in Cooperstown HoFame. &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Marion Arakawa born 1922 [Frank's single daughter 1891-1977]</p>
<p>Marion grew up on Keawe St. next to Steamy Chow [born 1922].  Marion</p>
<p>is a great writer who compiled her life story solely for her nieces/nephews/</p>
<p>progeny.  Amazing downtown Hilo history thru the eyes of a child.  Marion</p>
<p>describes walking thru bushes to get to what she calls black sand lot, where</p>
<p>water pooled into a shallow lake after heavy rains &#8212; what is today our</p>
<p>downtown KTA parking lot.  I told Marion that black sand lot was the home</p>
<p>of Little Tokyo district a century ago before the whole block burned down</p>
<p>from a fire 1914.  She was stunned that her jungle/duck haven once was bustling</p>
<p>Little Tokyo.  Marion preserved her famous dad&#8217;s letters during internment</p>
<p>WWII.  In them he asks Marion&#8217;s mom to get the 1916 Washington Birthday</p>
<p>speech that he gave about serving 2 mothers &#8212; Lady Mikado/Lady Liberty.</p>
<p>He needed the speech to spring earlier from confinement.  Alas, mom didn&#8217;t</p>
<p>have it.  But 50 yrs. later I bump into this still remarkably attractive-</p>
<p>looking daughter who knew nothing about dad Frank&#8217;s enormous symbolism</p>
<p>of Lady Mikado/Lady Liberty.  Frank&#8217;s speech was quoted verbatim in the</p>
<p>Trib in 1916 [now known as President's Day].   Frank said that no one has</p>
<p>2 birth mothers.  Either we are born from Lady Mikado [Japan] or from Lady</p>
<p>Liberty [U.S.].   Frank/Sanji Abe 1895-1982/Ernie Mitsuo Kuwahara 1899-</p>
<p>1982 are AJAs born HERE.  We are born from Lady Liberty.  Problem is that</p>
<p>Japan exercised citizenship even over those born outside of Japan, thus</p>
<p>ensnaring us w/dual citizenship [jus sanguinis].  Western culture has jus soli,</p>
<p>that we are citizens of our place of birth.  No problem w/dual citizenship.</p>
<p>No, Luso query is chosen dual citizenship &#8212; Luso/Portuguese National/alien</p>
<p>gets denizen status via approved application w/Haw&#8217;n Kingdom.  In contrast,</p>
<p>242 Luso became naturalized Haw&#8217;n Kingdom citizens [up to overthrow 1893],</p>
<p>thereby ceasing to be citizens of Portugal, as they had chosen to do.  &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>The kanyaku imin [contract laborers 1885 &amp; ensuing yrs.] were simple farmers</p>
<p>who intended to make money here &amp; return to Japan in 3 yrs.  They were not</p>
<p>settlers/pioneers, but sojourners/migratory folks.  When the few Issei/immigrants</p>
<p>afforded to go back to Japan, they found that Japan&#8217;s rigid class system</p>
<p>thwarted upward mobility for these ancestral farm-folk.  Which is why our Issei</p>
<p>bedded down for good here.  Yet Japan&#8217;s feudal remnants surfaced here.  Which</p>
<p>is why Masaji Marumoto was the 1st Nisei to ascend in the Issei JCC &#8211;because</p>
<p>Masaji learned feudal piety/custom by living w/Kawahara baron [daimyo Takei</p>

<p>heavie attorneys Wil Tsukiyama/Mas&#8217; senior partner Bob Murakami being</p>
<p>available but not chosen by their Issei genro/old farts, Wil/Bob being totally</p>
<p>Americanized. </p>
<p>Kotonks/Mainland-Stateside Nikkei endured harsher social pressure, engulfed</p>
<p>by majority Whites.  Buddaheads here were the majority race, despite our</p>
<p>lowest social/class standing.  We rose up the vacant middle class plane,</p>
<p>whilst kotonks stayed flattened as agrarian farmers/ghetto dwellers.  Kotonks</p>
<p>sailed back to Japan if they could afford the trip home.  But kotonks who</p>
<p>stayed put became totally Americanized, despite their Nippon purity of</p>

<p>Yes, Mazie Hirono&#8217;s shin [new] Issei banana complex [yellow on outside,</p>

<p>Bananas a la Joe Grant Masaoka [&amp; Mike].   BTW, though Mike Masaoka</p>
<p>ignored Hawai`i&#8217;s Issei [naturalization 1952/Statehood quest from 1900-</p>
<p>1959][probably got ass-kicked by buddahead primos-ilk of superhuman</p>
<p>Pablo Chinen], Masaoka was decent at the lowest root/buck pvt. bottom </p>
<p>[ruffian Isamu Kanekuni] &amp; at the intellectually elite top [w/visionary</p>
<p>Joe Itagaki].   Do you know that Masaoka wrote his autobio,</p>
<p>&#8220;They call me Moses Masaoka&#8221; &#8211;?   A shrinking violet he was not!!</p>
<p>Remember the oldtime song Furusato [home, sweet home]??</p>
<p>Who were really backward, buddaheads or kotonks??  Ha!! </p>
<p>Ad nauseam debate!!   We buddaheads talk pidgin Nipponese,</p>
<p>unlike our pureblood kotonks.  But Marumoto knew daimyo</p>
<p>etiquette vs. Joe Grant Masaoka&#8217;s ignorance.  Love, &#8211;Curt</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Union Theological Seminary &#8212; Nu`uanu Community Church</p>
<p>Hung Wai Ching 1905-2002 is the incredible product of Union</p>
<p>Theo. Sem./Nu`uanu Comm. Church.  Union&#8217;s great theologians</p>
<p>influenced Hung Wai [Martin Buber 1878-1965/Harry Fosdick</p>
<p>1878-1969/Paul Tillich 1886-1965].   As Scripps exclaimed</p>
<p>of GI Joe Ernie Pyle&#8217;s writing style, &#8220;a Mark Twain</p>
<p>quality which knocked my eye out,&#8221;  Hung Wai&#8217;s existential</p>
<p>theism is its own folksy/rustic creation &#8212;  &#8220;When I fail,</p>
<p>what positive/plus can I learn from it?&#8221;   &#8220;Tennyson,</p>
<p>better to have loved &amp; lost [or tried &amp; failed],</p>
<p>than never to have loved [or tried] at all.&#8221;   &#8220;Life</p>
<p>sucks at times, but what can I do to make it worthwhile?&#8221;</p>
<p>One may argue that Pyle, who had bouts of depression,</p>
<p>had a death wish [he died in combat from head wound</p>
<p>from machine gun fire -- Pyle buried at Punchbowl].</p>
<p>But Hung Wai had no death wish &#8212; Hung Wai inspired</p>
<p>life&#8217;s robustness in others, subconsciously to make</p>
<p>up for thugging out vs. Japs in his shanty Emmaville.</p>
<p>Yes, he lamented about not being able to talk to God,</p>
<p>but this is a human condition, which in its deepest throe</p>
<p>simply points out that God talks w/everyone, even if you</p>
<p>don&#8217;t think so.  God speaks thru interpreters [hobo/thief/</p>
<p>tycoon/Hollywood/egotists/abusers/users/etc.].  So</p>
<p>when Pastor Roy Kim revulsed at seeing hobos hobble</p>
<p>down the aisle to be saved, God was telling Roy to love</p>
<p>one, love all, even the unclean/unwashed/unhealthy.</p>
<p>This is God talking &#8211;straight to your heart.  So when</p>
<p>I glanced at a former flame who rejected me, I felt</p>
<p>at peace &#8212; that I gave love my all.  I never wished</p>
<p>for her to be miserable today, but if she is via her visible</p>
<p>discomfort at seeing me [I ignored her], that&#8217;s her problem,</p>
<p>not mine..  Guys, chalk one up for manhood.  Ha!  Yes, Hung</p>

            <div class="comment"><p>Hawai`i Catholic Diocese Bishop Larry Silva born 1947</p>
<p>        I was at Hilo&#8217;s McDonald&#8217;s</p>
<p>        fast food joint to chomp w/&#8221;termite&#8221; Luso gang</p>
<p>        [everybody goes home at 8 pm], inasmuch common saint Bill Araujo</p>
<p>        wanted to give me chocolate candy from Walmart for me to take home.</p>
<p>        I see a bald-headed haole in full-on black [pants/shirt] go to</p>
<p>        the bathroom, then up to the counter to order his food.  Why is he</p>
<p>        wearing all-black in the dark of nite?   He solitarily sits at a</p>
<p>        single table &amp; we all catch his collar &#8212; John Aguiar exclaims, &#8220;It&#8217;s</p>
<p>        Bishop Silva!&#8221; [Larry Silva]   Man, talk about grassroots!!  He looks</p>
<p>        so alone so I go over to him &amp; congratulate him on being our 2nd Luso</p>
<p>        bishop [after the great Stephen Alencastre 1876-1940/bishop 1926-</p>
<p>        1940].   Larry asks if he may join us &#8212; I say sure, why not?!!</p>
<p>        Our termites stop chomping &amp; turn into winged angels.  You could hear</p>
<p>        a pin drop as this holy man walks to our &#8220;nest.&#8221;   Man, down-to-earth/</p>
<p>        fan-friendly!  No one had the courage to talk regular in front of Bishop</p>
<p>        Silva, so I asked him, &#8220;What is your mission?&#8221;   Bishop Silva readily replied,</p>
<p>        &#8220;To bring to everyone our God.  People of all races, of all colors,</p>
<p>        everyone is included.  We have a Spanish mass going on right now at St.</p>
<p>        Joseph Church.  Everyone.&#8221;  Very empathic, very focused.   Bishop</p>
<p>        Alencastre emphasized Catholic education.   Bishop Silva emphasizes</p>
<p>        inclusion, racially/economically.    Stephen Alencastre was the first</p>
<p>        bishop to include in his episcopal crest the pulo&#8217;ulo&#8217;u [kapu sticks]/</p>
<p>        colors of the Hawaiian flag/Father Damien&#8217;s hat.  Bishop Larry Silva</p>
<p>        also has Saint Damien&#8217;s hat in Larry&#8217;s crest.  Stephen Alencastre</p>
<p>        was born in Porto Santo Madeira [where Christopher Columbus' wife's</p>
<p>        family is from, a canoe's berth from our Souza ancestral village of Fayal],</p>
<p>        &amp; emigrated to my ancient Wainaku in 1882 at 6 yrs. of age.</p>
<p>        St. Francis Hospital &amp; St. Louis College resulted from Bishop Alencastre. </p>
<p>        The Catholic Church saw immense/wondrous</p>
<p>        growth/expansion via his leadership.   Bishop Alencastre, being local</p>
<p>        &#8220;Pocho,&#8221; was very comfortable/easygoing/relaxed among local Luso here. </p>
<p>        In contrast, Larry Silva moved to San Leandro [Luso "nest" outside</p>
<p>        Oakland where our Souza emigrates live] at age 1 from Hawai`i, &amp; moved</p>
<p>        back here when he was ordained as bishop here.  Bishop Silva is not</p>
<p>        &#8220;Pocho&#8221; local, but he tries to assimilate/be just another guy among us. </p>
<p>        Credit him for his adaptability.  But mark my word, this self-effacing</p>
<p>        man is steel-honed/goal-oriented.  I studied him eyeball to eyeball</p>
<p>        last nite.</p>

<p>    Claus Spreckels&#8217; engineering &amp; technological innovations revolutionized the sugar</p>
<p>    industry, &amp; in 1881 he galvanized tourism via his Oceanic Steamship Co. from</p>
<p>    Frisco [the NYC of the West Coast, LA being a cowpoke basin w/only 10,000</p>
<p>    residents].   But Spreckels feuded w/Kalakaua over Kalakaua&#8217;s debts owed to</p>
<p>    Spreckels &amp; Kalakaua&#8217;s defiant nature vs. German Spreckels&#8217; &#8220;Herr von Boss/</p>
<p>    Imperial Saccharinity&#8221; arrogance, &amp; Spreckels left Hawai`i in 1886.  Spreckels&#8217;</p>
<p>    California sugar refinery was bypassed by our Big 5 to break up Spreckels&#8217;</p>
<p>    stranglehold over the world&#8217;s sugar trade, &amp; in 1905 the Big 5&#8242;s Co-op/</p>
<p>    C &amp; H Refinery triggered the decline for Spreckels.   But Spreckels was so</p>
<p>    dominant in other commercial sectors both before &amp; after his Hawai`i</p>
<p>    sojourn that our Big 5 was but a germless mosquito bite for Commodore Claus.</p>
<p>    Do you know that Masayuki Tokioka [founder Island Ins./Nat'l Mortgage which</p>
<p>    jumpstarted our AJA middle class via business/home ownership] twined his</p>
<p>    commercial ropes by managing Honoka`a Coffee Co./Mill in 1928?   Yes, w/</p>
<p>    a Harvard MBA, this Shin [new/recent] Issei [immigrant] started at the</p>
<p>    pastoral/rural wind-swept plain of my wife&#8217;s roots/Hamakua, overseeing</p>
<p>    80 fulltime workers, the 1st buddahead in a role reversal [vs. Luso luna/</p>
<p>    Jap vassals].   Masayuki learned the value of cross-cultural respect amid</p>
<p>    his Honoka`a labor-mgmt. antiquity/old-style trust-relations, the 1889</p>
<p>    Honoka`a Goto lynching reverberating still in 1928 [till this day, Goto's</p>
<p>    descendant Vern Yamanaka of auspicious Yamanaka Enterprises/Realty</p>
<p>    Inc. is sore still about racial frenzy vs. J_p Goto nearly 120 yrs. ago].</p>
<p>    Do you know that the Dao/Taoist &#8220;Wong Leung Do&#8221; Society [Taoism</p>
<p>    emerged simultaneously w/Confucianism] was the more visible</p>
<p>    element in our Hilo Chinese coterie a century ago?  Its hdqtr. stood</p>
<p>    on Kam Ave. next to what we know as Dr. Akira Yamanoha&#8217;s [later</p>
<p>    Sun Sun Lau Restaurant] hospital.   Dao was associated w/Punti</p>
<p>    [urbanites along Kam Ave.].   Confucian Ling Hing Society was across</p>
<p>    Hilo Hongwanji on Kilauea Ave., associated w/Hakka [pastoral/sojourners].</p>
<p>    A similar social class construct appeared in Frisco.   As erudite KingLit</p>
<p>    Ching says, Frisco&#8217;s &#8220;pecking order&#8221; consisted of merchants closest to</p>
<p>    Canton commerce at the top/who controlled high end trading/non-</p>
<p>    connected tradesmen made up the 2nd tier/toisan laborers were at</p>
<p>    the bottom.</p>
<p>    Do you know that Dem Katsuro Miho 1912-1995 was a big fan/protege</p>
<p>    of Maui forebearer Takaichi Miyamoto 1897-1981?   And also admired Woodrow</p>
<p>    Wilsonian internationalist [martial law-buster] J. Garner Anthony [2 yrs.</p>
<p>    younger than Miho's alter ego Miyamoto]?!  Because Miho moved to O`ahu,</p>
<p>    Miho saw Miyamoto&#8217;s conversion into senile Kanaka Johnny Wilson&#8217;s [1871-</p>
<p>    1956] rasputin/autocrat, something which Ola`a Rich Imai [born 1910 still</p>
<p>    razor sharp] never saw in the 1930 jesus/nurturant messiah version of</p>
<p>    Miyamoto during Miyamoto&#8217;s sojourns to Hilo to jump-start our new Dem</p>
<p>    Party.   Miho&#8217;s beautiful reminiscence of Kanaka Johnny Wilson foretells</p>
<p>    the odyssey of Jack Burns 1909-1975.   Broke-ass Wilson, like broke-ass</p>
<p>    Burns 30 yrs. later, always wore a worn-out faded suit w/frayed threads</p>
<p>    a-bare!!   Badge of honor/[vow of poverty not required for sainthood,</p>
<p>    however -- emulate C &amp; C's George P. Castle 1851-1932, who purchased</p>
<p>    the land for Rev. Takie Okumura's Christian church].   As Miho lovingly</p>
<p>    says, no &#8220;ho`okano&#8221; [natty/dapper] luxury for Johnny Wilson, just</p>
<p>    rank/file hoi polloi [Greek for the teeming masses]. </p>
<p>    And about Tokioka&#8217;s messiah Okumura 1865-1951, church members</p>
<p>    objected to Okumura&#8217;s Japan castle exemplar for the 1932 Makiki</p>
<p>    Christian Church [across McKinley High on Pensacola St.], to which</p>
<p>    inescapably resolute Okumura said [w/imprimatur-backing of</p>
<p>    Okumura's protege Tokioka] &#8220;The Lord is my rock, my high tower.&#8221;</p>
<p>    Proverbs 18:10.   Same adage which has carried my gaman/nintai</p>
<p>    noble cousin Naomi Narimatsu Lum Ho [endured insufferable</p>
<p>    obstacles in life] born 1943 all thruout her valorous life.   Reprise</p>
<p>    also Matthew 16:18-19 inner solitude &#8220;On Christ the solid rock I stand,</p>
<p>    all other ground is sinking sand!&#8221;   Words/experiences to live by!</p>
<p>    Aside, also Tammy Faye Bakker&#8217;s crucible [revered by "feminists"</p>
<p>    who stood w/Tammy Faye's unconquerable nature/Faith].   Love, &#8211;Curt</p>

<p>    Makiki Christian pastor Takie Okumura 1865-1951, whose son did not go to</p>
<p>    McKinley, but to Punahou as its 1st Nikkei [sponsored/paid for by missionary</p>
<p>    descendant Frank Atherton 1878-1945].   Tokioka learned well under the</p>
<p>    auspices of  incomparable Rev. Okumura.   Tokioka never took for granted</p>
<p>    living in America &#8212; he was naturalized in 1953, a year after Issei were</p>
<p>    allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship.   Whilst earlier his auspicious guru Rev. Okumura</p>
<p>    met personally w/WWII martial law governor Delos Emmons after Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>    &amp; was assured that Hawai`i&#8217;s 150,000 buddaheads were not going to be</p>
<p>    interned en masse.   In his last tribute to Tokioka&#8217;s &#8220;founder&#8221; Rev. Okumura, Tokioka</p>

<p>Subject: Franklin Odo </p>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I suddenly realize that Franklin Odo is a Hawaii Treasure.  We have a Kaimuki boy educated at UH with advanced degrees from Ivy League schools.  Franklin has stature in the International museum community.  What is more prestigious than the Smithsonian Institute?  “If one does not write history, someone else will write it.&#8221;  I have some insights into Franklin’s book “No Sword To Bury” which I will share with you later.  Without this book, the VVVs would be misunderstood and forgotten.  Few, if any, understand this.  Franklin states that Ted  Tsukiyama’s view of the role of the VVVs in establishing the 442nd was NOT the prevalent  VVV view  (so Curtis has a great insight).  Franklin’s book has ensured the VVVs&#8217; place in history that very few appreciate!   Dad Hung Wai bullied Franklin into writing the book &#8212; thank God or no book would have been written!!  </p>
<p>Networking with Kotonks is important to develop a full view of all that has happened to AJAs.  My hope is this insight along with Franklin’s efforts to dispel the “Minority myth” impacts National Policy.  America is a great Nation yet all the naysayers predict our downfall.  Our strength as a nation is based on idealistic concepts with our eclectic immigration properly promoted and advanced. The AJA experience during WWII is a landmark in American history and in the history of the world (as long as it is accurately recorded). &#8211;KL</p>

From: <a href="mailto:arnoldyee038@gmail.com">arnoldyee038@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>I must validate Mr. Liu&#8217;s comments about an American Chinese girl losing her citizenship if she married a Chinese citizen.  This is very true, the Cable Act of 1924 removed U.S. Citizenship from girls marrying Chinese from overseas.  I can personally attest to this fact because my mother who was a third generation born American lost her citizenship in 1926 when she married my dad.  This was not really discovered until my dad tried to get his social security and the Cable Act reared its ugly head around our family. [Curt's aunt Masako Kiyojima 1907-1990<br />
lost her U.S. citizenship when she married alien Hatsuyoshi Kiyojima 1899-1978; she then had to get naturalized after 1952 Japanese allowance act][Laura Yuen Chock's mother lost her U.S. citizenship when she married alien<br />
Mun Hon Yuen; she then had to get naturalized after 1943 Chinese allowance act]</p>
<p>It was a very dark time for many young Chinese-American girls because there were not too many Chinese-American men available for them to marry and marrying outside the Chinese race was unheard of in the 1920s.</p>
<p>Just a little known fact that I had to live through that was not very pleasing to me as a fourth generation American born Chinese.</p>
<p>I hope this sheds a little light on the discrimination we Chinese-Americans faced in the years from early 1850 to the late 1950s.  I personally faced much discrimination even in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Just some history to clear up O`ahu&#8217;s Edwin Liu&#8217;s remarks.</p>

<p>        &gt; Mert,<br />
        &gt;<br />
        &gt; I am looking forward to seeing the DVD when it becomes available. As you<br />
        &gt; know, my interest in the immigrant Chinese experience in the US has been<br />
        &gt; piqued more since I read about the Japanese immigrant experience, and then<br />
        &gt; did a little research on San Francisco Chinatown, LA Chinatown, the gold<br />
        &gt; rush, and the building of the transcontinental railroad.<br />
        &gt;<br />
        &gt; Of course you and I have dabbled in the history of overseas Chinese. I have<br />
        &gt; done some brief interviews with my Father&#8217;s sister and Mother&#8217;s sister and<br />
        &gt; the stories about each side of the family are fascinating. I also have a<br />
        &gt; little background about my aunt Bessie Loo&#8217;s husband&#8217;s family who founded<br />
        &gt; the SF Chinatown telephone exchange and the very special circumstances that<br />
        &gt; enabled his family to do so. They were the first Chinese to live in Palo<br />
        &gt; Alto. Ron Quon&#8217;s parents were the first to live in Beverly Hills.<br />
        &gt;<br />
        &gt; I am curious about the historical quality of the work of Andermann. To do<br />
        &gt; the right job requires lots of research and a historian&#8217;s perspective. The<br />
        &gt; piece about the Punaluu Chings done separately was interesting too.<br />
        &gt; [Curt's note:  the Andermann film was top plate; thankfully, man of<br />
        &gt;  practical wisdom Daniel W.Y. Kwok was the featured entree]<br />
        &gt;<br />
        &gt; Curtis Narimatsu is also following the Hawaii Chinese experience closely.<br />
        &gt; Curtis always manages to dig up significant pieces of history never<br />
        &gt; publicized previously. He understands Hawaii history in a larger context<br />
        &gt; which then expands the role of individual contributions, some who are<br />
        &gt; obscure until he discovers them. You would be amazed at what Curtis knows<br />
        &gt; about Hawaii Chinese. You would be shocked too!  &#8211;KingLit [Hung Wai's 73<br />

HUMAN MATTERS: Thoughtful encounter leads to musings about love<br />
STEVEN KALAS<br />
Human Matters<br />
I hear her shout the man’s name, and I look up from my convenience store gasoline pump to see a young woman running down the sidewalk toward the bus stop, clutching a paper bag. The man looks up and grins a million dollar smile, shaking his head the way you do when you realize a foolish oversight.<br />
He motions to the driver to wait. The woman closes the distance and hands him the bag. They embrace. Kiss. He whops her on the butt as she turns, and he steps onto the bus. The door closes. She waves, and retraces her steps in the direction whence she came.<br />
Methinks somebody forgot his lunch. But he won’t be condemned to eating fat, salt and preservatives from a vending machine today, because this woman caught the mistake and ran to him.<br />
I tell myself this young couple doesn’t have a working car between them. Indeed, the woman is walking back toward a neighborhood of economically depressed apartments. I imagine they are only rich in love.<br />
It’s an amazing thing when somebody loves you. That is, if you will allow yourself to be amazed. I mean, on the one hand, it’s such an ordinary part of the human experience. And the ordinariness of it sometimes keeps us from noticing it. Being astonished by it.<br />
It seems to me that if someone is in love with you, that fact should regularly wallop you. Give you pause. Nail your feet to the floor. Fill you with wonder and gratitude. Which in turn will make it less likely that you will ever take that love for granted. Ever become blasé. Ever become entitled.<br />
People who live consciously are quite clear that quality love relationships don’t fall daily out of trees. Love isn’t earned or deserved. And while this or that attribute might have initially attracted your lover — hair, eyes, gait, carriage, physique, political views, humor, etc. — in the end the gift of love is so much more than a mere reaction to attributes.<br />
I’m saying that if your lover can provide perfunctory answers x, y and z to the question “Why do you love me?” then I would wonder about said love. Because love is a happening. Not an equation. The correct answer is a provocative smile, shrug of the shoulders and “I just do.”<br />
I’m reminded of the fictional college professor Dr. Harry Wolper, played by Peter O’Toole in the 1985 movie “Creator.” His student assistant, Boris, is sweet on a girl. Boris asks the eccentric Dr. Wolper how he would know if he were in love. I paraphrase the professor’s response: “Well, you can always apply the Wolper Love Formula, whereby you calculate the number of times each day you think about her. Then you compare that number to the number of times each day you think about yourself. If the first number is greater than the second, there’s an excellent chance that you’re in love.”<br />
Which, in turn, reminds me of my all-time favorite definition of love. Favorite because of its purity. Simplicity. It was penned by Richard Bach in the book “Illusions”: “Love is a wish for someone’s happiness.”<br />
Yet, I feel the need to tinker with Bach’s definition. I would say it’s more than a wish. It’s a wish, yes, but also the evident and consistent willingness to participate toward the end of your beloved’s happiness. You’re willing to work for it. You’re intentional. You make someone else’s deepest happiness the source of your deepest happiness. Yes, sometimes bringing happiness to your mate is a spontaneous, easy joy. Other times you make sacrifices.<br />
You run like the wind, for example — hair askew, without makeup or decorum — to your neighborhood bus stop, clutching a lunch bag and shouting your beloved’s name.</p>

HUMAN MATTERS: Life’s journey includes pain of suffering<br />
STEVEN KALAS<br />
Human Matters<br />
Suffering is a profound mystery. If you ever meet anyone who can explain it to you, all neat and tidy, run away. Especially if they are trying to sell you CDs and a workbook in an infomercial.<br />
Authentic spirituality doesn’t explain suffering. It courageously acknowledges it. “Life is suffering,” said the Buddha (The Four Noble Truths). “Pick up your cross and follow me,” said Jesus. “If I make my bed in hell, thou art there,” said the Hebrew psalmist. And once acknowledged, serious religious practice proceeds to encounter suffering in a way that leads to hope and meaning.<br />
The Romans gave us two words for suffering: patior, which means “to endure, to allow,” and suffero, or “to bear up.” The Greeks gave us pascho, or “to experience.” It intrigues me that none of these three words bespeak of pain, per se. All three words have in common an intention and willingness to be radically open and present to life as life is — joyous or sorrowful, delightful or painful.<br />
Yet, most of us commonly associate the word “suffering” with something unpleasant, painful or even agonizing.<br />
The central thing we suffer is not physical or emotional pain, but loss. In the midst of illness, tragedy, death — in the midst of life! — meaning is threatened, along with our sense of hope, safety and security. Our belief in a well-ordered and benevolent universe is challenged by deadly weather, accidents, evil and DNA molecules run amok. Saints and scoundrels alike experience absurd, chaotic, inexplicable suffering.<br />
We don’t get to choose whether we suffer, or always what we must suffer. But, thankfully, we do have some freedom to choose how we suffer, and to what end.<br />
Ego suffering refers to the pain and problems resulting from the ego’s refusal to acknowledge pain and problems. We cannot encounter suffering creatively, precisely because the ego will not encounter suffering at all. Oh, the ego will bemoan it. Wail and dramatize. But not encounter.<br />
Indeed, most of what we call suffering comes into our lives as a consequence of our refusal to suffer. We suffer estrangement and isolation because we refuse to suffer the joys and the pains of intimacy. We suffer addictions to avoid suffering the pain within our souls. We suffer depression because we cannot suffer our anger or grief. We suffer guilt because we will not suffer the humility of asking for and accepting forgiveness.<br />
We suffer because we refuse to suffer.<br />
Transformative suffering refers to a conscious encounter with pain powered by the hope of emerging meaning and human transformation. It must be emphasized that the difference between ego suffering and transformative suffering is not found in the suffering itself, but in our relationship to the suffering. In how we suffer. In and of itself, pain is neither a moral good nor moral evil. That we are in pain does not necessarily indicate anything about us. At all. What we do with and in our pain: This may point to character.<br />
Do you have some suffering to do? Here are a few things to remember:<br />
Let the mystery of suffering be the mystery.<br />
Our temptation is to reduce the suffering to something less chaotic and more intellectually manageable. “There must be a reason,” we protest. And so we construct reasons. Often the reasons make us even more miserable.<br />
Share the suffering.<br />
The opportunity to tell the story of our suffering to a compassionate and skillful listener is helpful beyond measure. Simply in the telling and retelling, we begin to shift perspective, to put a healing distance between us and the pain.<br />
Turn to the wisdom of symbol and ritual.<br />
Medals of honor, funerals, statues and monuments, ritual mourning, legacy, keepsakes — we are symbolic creatures, and our symbols help us to embrace and transcend our suffering.<br />
Discover redemptive mission.<br />
Many people discover meaning in suffering as they work to redeem their suffering in service to the world. And so the alcoholic becomes an AA sponsor. The mother whose child is killed by a drunken driver becomes an activist with Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The mercenary becomes a naturalist. The victim of child abuse becomes a marriage and family counselor. And so it goes.<br />
Turn suffering to witness.<br />
Sometimes we suffer as a testimony against injustice. We decide to suffer as a way of absorbing the cost of hatred and bearing witness against the insanity of revenge. Or sometimes we willingly suffer for the sake of endurance alone. That is, as a witness to the goodness of life.<br />

<p>LAUPAHOEHOE SUGAR COMPANY HISTORY</p>
<p>Laupahoehoe Sugar Company was located at Laupahoehoe on the Hamakua Coast of the island of Hawaii. The coastline, from Hilo Bay to Niulii, is bordered by sea cliffs and cut by steep gulches. The plantation fields extended approximately 10 miles along the coast and rose to 1850 feet above sea level. Ending in high sea cliffs, 22 gulches divided the company land. </p>
<p>In 1880, Theophilus H. Davies and William Lidgate formed a partnership and established the Laupahoehoe Sugar Company. The new plantation employed 70 men, 50 mules and 70 oxen. Mr. J.M. Lydgate became Laupahoehoe&#8217;s first manager and Theo. H. Davies &amp; Co. served as its agency. At the time of this writing, the relationship between William Lidgate and J.M. Lydgate is not clear.</p>
<p>Honolulu Iron Works was chosen to manufacture a 15-ton mill, which was erected in 1881 at the shoreline site near a high bluff two miles south of Laupahoehoe. Cane was flumed down the bluff to the mill from fields as far as four miles away. An excellent landing for interisland ships was one of the advantages of the site. </p>
<p>In 1882, a severe storm badly damaged the new mill, causing part of the bluff to fall into the factory. The mill was repaired and sugar continued to be manufactured there until 1890.</p>
<p>The Laupahoehoe Sugar Company was incorporated in 1883 and in the following year the Kaiwilahilahi Sugar Company joined with Laupahoehoe. The records indicate that at least two mills were operating at Laupahoehoe Sugar Company during the 1880s, one of which was the Kaiwilahilahi mill and the other was the Laupahoehoe mill. Mr. Lydgate had a third mill built for the Company, this one at Papaaloa. The records are not clear as to exactly when this mill was erected, though the mid-1880s seem likely. Both the Laupahoehoe mill and the Kaiwilahilahi mill closed in 1890 and all Laupahoehoe Sugar Company cane was ground at the Papaaloa mill.</p>
<p>Laupahoehoe Sugar boasted a unique transportation system to supply the factory with cane. A steam hoist lifted cane-loaded cars up 1100 feet by cable at Maulu Gulch. At the top, the cane was dumped into flumes and traveled to the mill about a mile distant.</p>
<p>In 1909, an area of 360 acres was set aside for homesteads and in 1914 another 950 acres were so designated under the Homestead Act. The homesteaders grew cane under contract which they sol to Laupahoehoe Sugar. The Company purchased cane from adherent planters holding various kinds of contracts. Some planters were independent, some were homesteaders and some were members of contract gangs. </p>
<p>By 1920, about half the original cane land was planted and harvested by homesteaders and the other half was cultivated by Laupahoehoe Sugar Company. In 1918, the annual yield was 12000 tons of sugar.</p>
<p>The plantation was noted for having model plantation camps. The camp houses were surrounded by garden space, and playgrounds and concrete bathhouses were provided. In 1918, 12 plantation camps housed the 900 laborers employed by Laupahoehoe Sugar.</p>
<p>Because of the extensive gulches in the plantation fields, flumes were used instead of railways to transport the harvested cane to the mill. In 1922, a new high life pump was installed to move two million gallons of water a day out of Kaawalii Gulch up to the head of the main flume at the 750-foot level. The main flume carried 30 tons of cane per hour to the mill. Laupahoehoe Sugar was the first plantation in Hawaii to lift water for fluming as high as 750 feet. </p>
<p>Contour plowing and planting were used to prevent erosion on the uneven terrain and, while he was manager, Mr. Lydgate introduced the practice of planting his fallow fields to blue lupine for erosion control and to plow under as green manure. </p>
<p>In 1937, there were about 6400 acres of cane land at Laupahoehoe Sugar Company, some being cultivated by homesteaders and planters and some by the Company. A total of 881 people worked at Laupahoehoe, 60% of who came from the Philippines. American citizens comprised 25% of the Company employees and 75% were citizens of other countries. </p>
<p>A plantation hospital was completed in 1937, giving plantation workers the latest in medical care. Continuing to improve living condition on the plantation, large expenditures were also made in 1938. Water was piped to every dwelling, villages were modernized, clubhouses, parks, the gymnasium and community halls were remodeled or built for the benefit of the laborers. In 1941, the plantation office was air-conditioned and new homes of the bungalow type were built. </p>
<p>In 1943, the historic Maulu Gulch hoist was destroyed when the brake on a loaded can car snapped and the car crashed down the 1100-foot incline. </p>
<p>Laupahoehoe Sugar Company aided the war effort and the U.S. armed forces by providing men for guard duty and to drive trucks. Housing and recreational facilities were leased to the Army for the duration of the war. </p>
<p>The managers of Laupahoehoe Sugar Company during the time covered by this brief history include:<br />
J. M. Lydgate, 1880-1888,<br />
Colin McLennan, 1889-1914,<br />
Robert A. Hutchison, 1915-1944<br />

            <div class="comment"><p>From Steelgrass.org:</p>
<p>Emily and Will Lydgate, owners of Steelgrass Farm, are the great-grandchildren of John Mortimer Lydgate, founder of the family’s Kauai branch, who arrived in Hawaii as a small boy in the 1860’s. Living first in Laupahoehoe on the Big Island, where he learned to speak fluent Hawaiian, John Mortimer, or JM as he is remembered, was more interested in education and the world of ideas than in acquiring property or making money in the sugar industry. As a teenager he was employed by the physician and botanist William Hillebrand to assist him on his expeditions into Hawaii’s forests to collect local plants, few of which had been systematically catalogued or given Western scientific names. These expeditions resulted in the publication in 1887 of Hillebrand’s The Flora of the Hawaiian Islands, the first and still a standard reference work on Hawaiian plants. The book begins with a dedicatory note to JM, and to this day, there are over a dozen native Hawaiian plants, many of them rare and endangered, whose botanical names include the term lydgatei, in recognition of the boy who was the first to bring them to the attention of the scientific community. </p>
<p>JM’s interest in education led him to spend as much time as he could going to school, first at Oahu College in Honolulu, since renamed Punahou School, then the Universities of Toronto, Heldelberg, and Edinburgh, from which he earned his M.A., and later Yale Divinity School. At Punahou, JM became a favorite student of William Dewitt Alexander, who was later appointed the school’s Headmaster, and eventually became Surveyor-General of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Alexander taught the young man surveying, and while JM was still in his late teens, he got the job to lay out the road from Hilo to the town of Volcano on the Big Island, a route that everyone headed that way still drives today. </p>
<p>Following his Divinity School experience, JM was ordained as a Minister in the Congregational Church, and by the beginning of 1896 was ready to take up his first church post, serving a congregation in a small coastal town in the state of Washington. Just before that, however, he went on a long-planned trip to Hawaii to visit his mother, then still living at Laupahoehoe on the Big Island. After the visit, JM returned by steamer from Hilo to Honolulu, only to find that the boat that would carry him back to the Mainland was unexpectedly delayed, and would not sail for another week. This allowed time for what JM thought would be a quick side trip to Kauai to visit old friends from his Punahou days. </p>
<p>One of those friends was Dr. Jared Smith, at the time the sole Western-educated doctor on the entire Island. Smith was concerned about the long-unmet need for a minister who could serve both Kauai’s Hawaiian people and its newly-arrived English-speaking residents. Ordained ministers fluent in the Hawaiian language who also possessed extensive first-hand experience of the islands and their peoples were an extremely rare commodity, and Dr. Smith seized the opportunity to present JM with a simple but compelling argument: there are many candidates who can minister to the fine people of the state of Washington, he said, but you are the only one with what it takes to serve here on Kauai. </p>
<p>Family lore doesn’t record how JM extricated himself from his obligations in Washington, but we know he did, because church records indicate that he gave his first sermon on Kauai on the first Sunday in May 1896. According to Bill “Peacher” Lydgate, JM’s youngest son and Emily and Will’s Grandfather, JM would conduct the service for the English-speaking congregation at the church in Lihue in the morning. Then Peacher and his three older brothers would hitch up the horse cart and drive Father from Lihue to Koloa, where he preached an afternoon sermon in Hawaiian. Occasionally after the service, while JM socialized with his parishioners, there was time for the Minister’s four boys to ride the horse cart down the dirt roads to a great bodysurfing spot at Poipu, now called Brennecke’s, which was then a broad sandy beach with an excellent left. </p>
<p>JM’s interest in the literary and other non-material aspects of existence led him to change the spelling of his last name from Lidgate, as it was written on his birth certificate, to Lydgate, in honor of a family ancestor, the Fifteenth-Century English poet John Lydgate. This change also served to distinguish JM from his siblings, who retained the original Lidgate spelling, and who went on to acquire considerable wealth through the sugar industry. As a further distinguishing characteristic, JM renounced his original citizenship, and had himself made a naturalized subject of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Perhaps most significant of all, throughout his life JM elected never to purchase real estate, believing that he could not serve his community to the fullest if he were in thrall to the self-interest of active membership in the landowner class. As a result, when he died at the age of 68 in 1922, he left neither money nor property, and his widow, Helen Elwell Lydgate, was obliged to move away from Kauai to live with her grown sons and their families on the Mainland. </p>
<p>What JM did leave, however, was a lasting legacy of community building and stewardship of the ‘aina. He was a founder and an early supporter of the YMCA, the Garden Island Newspaper, the Kauai Historical Society and the Public Library. Although it took many years, before the end of his life he fulfilled one of the first goals he set for his ministry when he moved to Kauai: to visit every dwelling, and to get to know every single family, on the entire island. As a small-town minister, and one of the very few Kauai residents not of Hawaiian blood who was completely fluent in the Hawaiian language, JM’s was an important voice for inclusion and tolerance, as well as for the protection and preservation of Hawaiian lands and culture. Continuing his surveying work, JM laid out a number of critical routes on Kauai, including the Wainiha Power Line on the North Shore, but his survey discoveries in the area of the Wailua River in Kapa’a were his most significant. </p>
<p>JM was the first in the English-speaking community to recognize and map the chain of heiau, ancient Hawaiian temples, that stretches inland from the Wailua river’s mouth. Beginning with a sanctuary or “City of Refuge” adjacent to the beach, this progression of linked sacred areas culminates in Hikini A Ka La, at the summit of the hill across from Opaeka’a Falls, one of the most culturally significant sites in the entire Hawaiian Islands. JM’s dedication to preserving these sites placed him at odds with his neighbors in Kauai’s influential sugar industry, however: in that era, few recent arrivals viewed Hawaiian culture as a thing of value. Despite the fact that they were sacred to the Hawaiian people, the only valuable thing most people saw in heiau was a large quantity of stone, ideal for cane field irrigation ditches, that was free for the taking. Best of all, the stone was conveniently piled right next to the road. </p>
<p>In retrospect it seems remarkable that through the moral force of his presence, JM was able to influence enough people, inside church and out, to prevent wholesale destruction of these sites. Nonetheless he succeeded, and in the 1930’s the Territory of Hawaii dedicated a large area of land at the mouth of the Wailua River as Lydgate Park, in grateful recognition for JM’s work to preserve and honor Hawaiian culture, as well as to enrich the lives of all Kauaians.</p>

<p>PEPEEKEO SUGAR COMPANY HISTORY</p>
<p>Pepeekeo Sugar Company, located on the windward side of the island of Hawaii between Onomea and Honomu, held the majority of its land in fee simple. The plantation occupied approximately four miles along the ocean cliffs and extended from three to 18 miles mauka to 1600 feet in elevation on the slopes of Mauna Kea.</p>
<p>The company, called the Metcalf Plantation, was started at Kaupakuea in 1857 by Theophilus Metcalf and the first crop was harvested in 1859. Mr. Metcalf&#8217;s was the first factory in Hawaii to use the vacuum pan in 1863.</p>
<p>In 1874, after Mr. Metcalf&#8217;s death, the plantation was purchased by Messrs. Afong and Achuck and the name changed to Pepeekeo Sugar Company. By 1881 the crop was estimated at 1800 tons and the factory was constructed of corrugated iron buildings with machinery manufactured by Honolulu Iron Works.</p>
<p>In 1882, Mr. Akana became the plantation manager and Mr. C. Afong was the company owner as well as the agent. 1886 saw a new mill from Honolulu Iron Works in place and in 1888, Mr. Wong Tuck became the new manager.</p>
<p>Mr. H. Deacon and Mr. Alexander Young, manager of Honolulu Iron Works, purchased Pepeekeo Sugar in 1889. The Company was incorporated on October 14, 1889, with Mr. Deacon as manager and H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. as agents. T.H. Davies &amp; Co. served as agents from 1892 to 1904, when C. Brewer &amp; Co. purchased control from Mr. Young, who used the funds to build the Alexander Young Hotel on Bishop Street in Honolulu.</p>
<p>By 1910 the annual yield was 8,000 tons processed by a 9-roller mill with a capacity to grind 60 tons of cane per day. The warehouse could store 24,000 bags of sugar, which were loaded onto interisland steamers by steel cables from the sea cliff. Plantation fields were connected by good dirt roads and the harvested cane was delivered to the mill by railroad cars and 15 miles of stationary flumes. </p>
<p>There were 700 employees at Pepeekeo Sugar, all of whom worked on the day labor system, there being no contract laborers at the plantation. By 1914, homesteaders were using 625 acres to grow cane that was processed at the company mill.</p>
<p>Manager James Webster had become noted for his farming methods; in 1904 he initiated plowing under cane trash for fertilizer instead of burning it off. The improvement in soil prompted HSPA to take up the method and expand it to other plantations. Another innovation, made during mill improvements, was to place the grinding machinery some 60 feet below the boiling house. This facilitated the delivery of cane by flume and the flume water was used extensively in the mill. The Gartley clarification system, developed by Brewer engineer A.A. Gartley, was also an innovation at Pepeekeo Sugar.</p>
<p>By 1923 Mr. Webster&#8217;s good farming practices had increased the yield from 3.1 tons to 4.6 tons per acre in 15 years. Most of the cane of the plantation was Yellow Caledonia and Pepeekeo Sugar kept some ratoon crops for as long as 12 to 18 years. The soil was improved annually with 50,000 tons of Waianae coral sand as well as bone meal and guano. Eucalyptus trees were planted as windbreaks, protecting the fields near the ohia forests. </p>
<p>Water sources at Waiaama Stream and Kauku Hill provided clear water form natural filter beds for all plantation uses including turning a water wheel to generate power. Cultivation inventions included the Webster&#8217;s careful farming dictated deep plowing at 18-20 inches, which improved the soil each year. The manager continued to live in the old Afong residence just above the mill. </p>
<p>In 1930, machinery was installed to dry, sift, and sack bagasse from the mill to be used for livestock feed. The product was sold in Los Angeles through Grace Brothers in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Because the land was bumpy with many winding gulches, road improvement was ongoing, using a rock crusher brought from Scotland in the 1890s. There were 120 mules and 25 horses used on the plantation in 1932, providing transport for the fields split by ridges and gulches. Tractors with caterpillar tracks were used for plowing and trucks now hauled mud press, stable manure, and lime to the fields. 20 miles of permanent flumes brought cane to the mill.</p>
<p>At age 80, after 32 years at Pepeekeo manager, Mr. Webster retired in 1936 and Mr. Andrew T. Spalding, manager at Honomu Sugar, succeeded as manager of Pepeekeo on January 1, 1937.</p>
<p>In 1941, harvested cane was trucked to the mill for the first time, due to a shortage of water for fluming. Though water shortages continued for the next two years, a record crop was produced in 1944.</p>
<p>March 1946 saw Hanomu Sugar Co. merged with Pepeekeo and Mr. A. Douglas Ednie became manager of the combined plantations. M r. Ednie had a difficult year, however, as Pepeekeo Sugar showed a loss of $141,430, the first loss in 10 years. An industry-wide strike, higher labor costs, unfavorable weather, and the April tidal wave that destroyed the railroad and terminals in Hilo added to the problems of 1946. </p>
<p>In 1947, the Pepeekeo mill was shut down for extensive modernization to accommodate the addition of the cane from the Honomu fields. Reconstruction of over $2,000,000 required an agency overdraft and a loan from Bank of Hawaii in 1948.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s a number of lots and houses on the plantation were sold to residents, as was the Honomu company store. Due to the increase in mechanical harvesting, the labor force of 460 was reduced to 400 in 1956. The late 1950s brought numerous union slowdowns, walkouts, and shutdowns to Pepeekeo.</p>
<p>Mr. Ednie retired as manager in 1960, replace by Mr. L.S. McLane from Hilo Sugar Co. The merger of Pepeekeo and Hakalau sugar companies was affected in 1963, with Mr. Herbert M. Gomez becoming manager of the combined company. 1963 was also the year in which the Hilo office of C. Brewer &amp; Co. instituted a computer system to service plantation automotive equipment. </p>
<p>In 1971 Wainaku, Hakalau, Pepeekeo, and Papaikou sugar companies were consolidated in a processing cooperative that also included independent cane growers. Two years later, Pepeekeo Sugar merged with Mauna Kea Sugar to form Mauna Kea Sugar Co., Inc., the state&#8217;s fourth largest sugar company with 18,000 acres of cane. The mills at Wainaku and Hakalau were closed as the Pepeekeo mill was modernized to double its capacity by 1974. </p>

            <div class="comment"><p>I dedicate Prayer under a Pepper Tree to Brother John &amp; Sister Luedeen Andrew, born 1942/1943 respectively [Brother John is the great-great-grandson of Mormon pioneer/destiny-maker George Q. Cannon 1827-1901; Sister Luedeen is the descendant of the first latter day saint martyr].  Heartstopper confluence, that Abbie Kailimai 95 yrs. old razor sharp lass [pioneer Hawaiian Mormon Samuel Kailimai's granddaughter, &amp; seer son of Samuel --David Keola Kailimai's niece], &amp; our utterly beloved Andrew missionaries worship here in Honomu, Hawai&#8217;i as Mormon Church members.  Abbie&#8217;s Honomu estate devolves from her father&#8217;s purchase of his sister&#8217;s kids&#8217; shares [famous sugar master Kinney's estate].  Love eternally, &#8211;Curt</p>
<p>After traveling to Hawaii, Elders McKay and Cannon inspected the Church school at Laie and then visited the other islands. Elder Cannon particularly requested they visit Pulehu on Maui where his father, George Q. Cannon, had baptized the first Hawaiian in July 1851. Thirty-four years later, President McKay recalled the events of their visit to Maui.</p>
<p>“So we came up here, and this is where I was [pointing to a spot where a pepper tree had been], and as we looked at an old frame house that stood there then, he said, ‘That is probably the old chapel.’ It seemed to me it was over in the distance. Nothing else was here. We said ‘Well, probably that is the place. We are probably standing on the spot upon which your father, George Q. Cannon, and Judge Napela addressed those people.’ We became very much impressed with the surroundings, association, and spiritual significance of the occasion; as we had also been with the manifestations we had had on our trip to the Orient and thus far in Hawaii. I said, ‘I think we should have a word of prayer.’ . . .</p>
<p>“I offered the prayer. We all had our eyes closed, and it was a very inspirational gathering. As we started to walk away at the conclusion of the prayer, Brother Keola Kailimai took Brother E. Wesley Smith to the side and very earnestly began talking to him in Hawaiian. As we walked along, the rest of us dropped back. They continued walking, and Brother Kailimai very seriously told in Hawaiian what he had seen during the prayer. They stopped right over there [pointing a short distance away] and Brother E. Wesley Smith said, ‘Brother McKay, do you know what Brother Kailimai has told me?’ I answered, ‘No.’ ‘Brother Kailimai said that while you were praying, and we all had our eyes closed, he saw two men who he thought were Hugh J. Cannon and E. Wesley Smith step out of line in front of us and shake hands with someone, and he wondered why Brother Cannon and Brother Smith were shaking hands while we were praying. He opened his eyes and there stood those two men still in line, with their eyes closed just as they had been. He quickly closed his eyes because he knew he had seen a vision.’</p>
<p>“Now Brother Hugh J. Cannon greatly resembled Brother George Q. Cannon, his father. I spoke during the trip of his resemblance. Of course, E. Wesley Smith has the Smith attribute just as President Joseph Fielding Smith has it. Naturally, Brother Keola Kailimai would think that these two men were there. I said, ‘I think it was George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, two former missionaries to Hawaii, whom that spiritual-minded man saw.’</p>
<p>“We walked a few steps farther and I said, ‘Brother Kailimai, I do not understand the significance of your vision, but I do know that the veil between us and those former missionaries was very thin.’ Brother Hugh J. Cannon who was by my side, with tears rolling down his cheeks, said ‘ Brother McKay, there was no veil. ’” 10</p>

<p>Prayer under a Pepper Tree: Sixteen Accounts of a Spiritual Manifestation<br />
By Lavina Fielding Anderson</p>
<p>Records reveal vivid information from personal points of view, about a spiritual experience shared by five in Hawaii in 1921.</p>
<p>In 1920-21, David O. McKay, then a forty-seven-year-old Apostle, toured the worldwide missions of the Church, beginning with Japan and Korea. He dedicated the land of China for the preaching of the gospel, visited Hawaii, returned briefly to Salt Lake City for the funeral of President Anthon H. Lund, and then continued through the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, India, and Europe. He was accompanied on this arduous year-long tour by Hugh J. Cannon, president of Liberty Stake in Salt Lake City and a member of the Deseret Union Sunday School General Board, of which President McKay was general superintendent.</p>
<p>Among the many spiritual manifestations that occurred during this world tour came a remarkable event during the thirty-six hours they spent on Maui. President McKay and Brother Cannon docked at Maui at 4:30 A.M. February 9, 1921, held a meeting at mission headquarters in the morning, and held another for members in the evening; during the afternoon they visited the sites where Hugh J. Cannon&#8217;s father, George Q. Cannon, had met Jonatana H. Napela, resulting in the first baptism in Maul and the organization of the first branch of the Church in Hawaii, and where George Q. Cannon had also received intense spiritual manifestations. Accompanying the party were E. Wesley Smith, Hawaiian Mission president and a son of Joseph F. Smith, who had also served as a Hawaiian missionary; Samuel Harris Hurst, Jr., a missionary of mature years from Idaho who was then president of the Central Maul Conference; and David Keola Kailimai, a Hawaiian missionary, also of mature years, who owned the little Ford in which the party traveled.</p>
<p>Hugh J. Cannon was greatly touched by visiting the sites associated with his father, and on the grounds of the little chapel at Pulehu, President McKay felt inspired to offer a prayer of thanksgiving. During that prayer, all five men were deeply stirred spiritually, and Brother Kailimai, speaking in Hawaiian to President Smith, said he had seen a vision. President McKay, after President Smith translated Brother Kailimai&#8217;s words, did not interpret the vision but confirmed its divine origins by affirming that &#8220;the veil was very thin.&#8221; Hugh J. Cannon, who had been most profoundly affected during the experience, testified that, at least for him, there had been no veil.</p>
<p>What was the manifestation called forth by the combination of faith and filial love of these five Church leaders? How did the five experience it and how did they describe it, both then and later? What message does it have about the nature of spiritual experience for readers who learn of it through the more distant witness of the written record?</p>
<p>Thanks largely to the kindness of many members of the families involved, I have found sixteen separate accounts of this event, all but four of them unpublished. This essay examines these accounts in chronological order and in the context of the participants&#8217; lives, as an exploration of the dynamics of memory, faith, love, and spirituality.<br />
Samuel Harris Hurst&#8217;s Account<br />
Of the five participants, only David Kailimai, the man who saw the vision, left no personal account, either at the time or later. Abigail Kahanu Kailimai Kailimai, who is both David&#8217;s niece and his daughter-in-law, does not recall an earlier oral version or, in fact, ever hearing this experience from Elder Kailimai. However, Samuel Harris Hurst, Jr., kept a daily diary and recorded the event within hours of its occurrence. Elder Hurst was then thirty-six, a native of Cache Valley, and a widower. His wife had died a lingering death from heart disease shortly before, leaving him with a ten-year-old daughter, Inez. He had had grave doubts about serving a mission under such circumstances but had accepted the calling, at least partly because of his child&#8217;s faith, even though he had to sell his farm to pay his expenses. His diary and his autobiography, written in 1958, breathe a solid, simple faithfulness that is very moving. He confesses that being called to Hawaii was &#8220;quite a test to my faith.&#8221; His patriarchal blessing had told him he would &#8220;go to the land of my forefathers,&#8221; which did not seem to be possible. He thought he would be too old to learn Hawaiian fluently and adds with humility, &#8220;I had desires to be a good speaker, and I could not see any development for me if simple natives were to be my audience.&#8221; He wrestled with his doubts about whether his call had been inspired &#8220;all the way to Hawaii.&#8221; But when he saw Wesley Smith, the mission president, waiting for him on the dock, he recognized him as the man with whom he had labored as a missionary in a dream seen two years earlier. This dream had occurred a year before Smith had been called as mission president. &#8220;With this,&#8221; recorded Elder Hurst, &#8220;I knew that some power other than that of man was having something to do with it.&#8221; Elder Hurst also knew that he would be assigned to some island other than Oahu before President Smith made the assignments.<br />
Elder Hurst&#8217;s diary for February 8, 1921, records the prayer under the pepper tree in simple prose but eloquent detail:<br />
Elder McKay, Pros. Smith and Cannon Elder Keola and myself drove . . . out to Pulehu where Pres. Geo. Q. Cannon had his wonderful experience in the conversion of so many of the natives and the first to join the church. As we sat in the little Ford in front of the meeting house there, Pres. Smith related to us the story of how Pres. Cannon in 1850 or 51 had delivered his wonderful discourse in a little church which then stood on the ground we were then on. At this meeting he appeared to be standing in the air with a hallow of light around his head. At the same time all but three of the over hundred persons there present were transfigured before him. Bro. Hugh J. Cannon being a son of Pres. Cannon was very deeply effected [sic] more so than any one I have ever saw before. We then alighted from the car and walked around the grounds. At the rear of the old church on the grounds now in the shade of an old tree, Elder McKay said: &#8220;Brethren I feel impressed that we should render our thanks to the Lord for the labors of this great man and his co-laborer Pres. Joseph F. Smith whose sons arc represented here today.&#8221; At this we bowed in humble reverence in prayer to God and then I listened to one of the grandest prayers it has ever been my privilege to listen to. At its close Elder Keola testified he saw a hand and arm extended to me in an attitude of shaking hands. In speaking of this later Bro. McKay said &#8220;Bro. Keola, I do not know the significance of the hand you saw, but I know this that the veil between us and the other world was very thin.&#8221; Bro. Cannon then said</p>

Wesley Smith, Samuel Harris Hurst, Jr., and David Keola Kailimai. During the prayer, the party received a spiritual manifestation that moved them profoundly. Courtesy of BYU-Hawaii Archives.<br />
&#8220;There was no veil at all&#8221; at which the apostle cast a penetrating look at him for he as well as we seemed to be in doubt as to whether Bro. Cannon had beheld a vision or not but no more was said at that time. In closing his remarks in a general meeting held at Wailuku tonight Elder McKay made mention of this again and with tears in the eyes of both men he turned to Bro. Cannon and staping [sic] on the shoulder said, &#8220;My Brother, you have been closer to your Father today than you have ever been before.&#8221;<br />
Because Elder Hurst spoke Hawaiian, he probably heard Elder Kailimai&#8217;s testimony to President Smith as it was uttered. Neither here, on the very day that the event occurred, nor later, did Elder Hurst speculate on the possible meaning of this experience. He simply recorded Elder Kailimai&#8217;s words, President McKay&#8217;s response, and the powerful emotional and physical effect the manifestation had on Brother Cannon, along with Brother Cannon&#8217;s testimony of the temporary parting of the veil that separated him from his deceased father. Two of Elder Hurst&#8217;s daughters confirm that he did not interpret the story in telling it to them in later years. One of the daughters, Cleo Hurst Bailey, comments, &#8220;I have some personal feelings about it. All of those particular people&#8211;especially Hugh J. Cannon, E. Wesley Smith, and my father&#8211;had ancestors who took part in opening the islands to missionary work. I think all of those ancestors were there, and they knew it. It was a personal occasion, a quiet way of confirming that it was appropriate that my father be there.&#8221;<br />
The ancestor of Elder Hurst who had assisted in nineteenth-century missionary efforts was his grandfather, Frederick William Hurst, whose diary includes moving accounts of visions, inspirational dreams, and answered prayers. He had been born on the Isle of Jersey; his family then emigrated to New Zealand, and as a young man in the goldfields of Australia, he joined the Church with his younger brother, Charles Clement Hurst. As a result, his angry mother disowned him and marked his name out of the family Bible. On April 27, 1855, he and his brother emigrated with seventy-two Saints aboard the Tarquinia. The ship was leaking so badly by the time they reached Honolulu that, after repairs and an attempt to continue, they returned to Honolulu where the ship was eventually condemned. Fred W. contributed all of his savings&#8211;a thousand dollars in nuggets sewn into his clothing&#8211;to send the other members, mostly families, on to California. He accepted a mission call from President Silas Smith and almost immediately went to Molokai, where he served from August 1855 to October 1856. Gifted with an irrepressible cheerfulness, he learned Hawaiian quickly and met poverty undaunted. Often he walked barefoot. For a long period of time, food was very scanty. On February 8, 1856, he recorded thankfully, &#8220;We had three meals today for the first time for I will not venture to say how long. We fasted about three days this week.&#8221;<br />
After his mission, Fred Hurst worked his passage to northern California, where he voluntarily served another mission. When he was forty-two and living in Cache Valley with his wife and seven children, he was called to serve another mission, this time in New Zealand. He responded promptly though his eight-year-old daughter died three days before he left and his wife had six-month-old twins to care for in addition to five older children. In 1892-93, he worked as a painter on the Salt Lake Temple; he also served for many years as stake Sunday School superintendent in Cache Stake and served two stake missions. Throughout many years of poverty, sacrifice, and sorrow, he maintained a merry heart and strong faith. This was the man whose grandson joined in a prayer of thanksgiving with the sons of George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith under the pepper tree at Pulehu and to whose grandson Elder Kailimai saw extended a hand and arm in the &#8220;attitude of shaking hands.&#8221;<br />
David O. McKay&#8217;s Early Accounts<br />
The next account is President McKay&#8217;s detailed journal of his world tour, which remains unpublished except in excerpts. It is the most comprehensive source of the thirty-six hours the men spent on Maul. The mission history, although it records the young apostle&#8217;s visit, does not mention the incident at Pulehu. President McKay describes their visit to the George Q. Cannon sites, then gives this account of the prayer under the pepper tree:<br />
It seemed to me . . . that we were treading on sacred ground; for surely the Lord was the close companion and guide of that intrepid and faithful missionary [George Q. Cannon].<br />
We offered a united prayer on the ground, during which Bro. Keola seemed to see two men shaking hands. He thought Hugh J. was shaking hands with Elder Hurst, and was surprised when he opened his eyes to see Brother Cannon standing with bowed head and closed eyes! I do not</p>

<p>Cannon — along with President Hiram Clark and Elders Henry Bigler, Hiram Blackwell, John Dixon, William Farrer, James Hawkins, James Keeler, Thomas Morris and Thomas Whittle — arrived in Oahu on Dec. 12, 1850. Cannon was 22.</p>
<p>The next day, they climbed a hill that overlooked Honolulu, where they constructed a stone altar and dedicated the land.</p>
<p>The work was challenging. The Hawaiian governor refused to let them meet freely, and Protestant ministers preached loudly against the &#8220;Mormon sinners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cannon and the others were often ill and homesick. They ran out of money. The language barrier was frustrating.</p>
<p>But citing inspiration to do so, he focused his energy on the native islanders rather than the few white men and slowly made progress.</p>
<p>His journal entries — excerpted in Davis Bitton&#8217;s biography of Cannon — reflect his great love for the people.</p>
<p>When five of his disheartened companions decided to leave, he said, &#8220;This left me in this situation either to stay here and be blessed or to go home under condemnation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was determined to see to the Lord&#8217;s work.<br />
Story continues below</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, every time I had prayed to the Lord that there might be a good work done here, I had felt my bosom warm and felt the spirit continually whispering to me if I should persevere, I should be blest.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he could no longer pay the $10 demanded to rent a house, a woman by the name of Nalimanui offered him her hut and later her mat and blanket when he fell ill crossing the sea to Oahu.</p>
<p>Determined to get out among the people, Cannon visited Maui on foot, with the natives often carrying him on their backs across the island streams.</p>
<p>One day, crossing a swollen stream, he fell in the water, and a hospitable native and chief, Judge Jonathana Napela, took him in. Napela told him he&#8217;d had a vision of a minister of the gospel coming his way. He told Cannon, &#8220;My house, land and horses are all yours&#8221; and later painstakingly helped Cannon translate the Book of Mormon to Ka Buke a Moramona.</p>
<p>Elders Cannon and Keeler organized the first branch at Kealahou, the Pulehu Branch, in August 1851, in Kula on the island of Maui.</p>
<p>William Kauaiwiulaokalani Wallace III, a former director of BYU-Hawaii Hawaiian Studies, called Cannon one of the &#8220;great pioneer people&#8221; who brought light and truth to the islands.</p>
<p>Roy G. Bauer, director of the Hilo institute of religion, relates a story told by Abbie Kailimai&#8217;s father-in-law, who was with President David O. McKay in 1921 giving a prayer of thanksgiving in Pulehu.</p>
<p>&#8220;(President) McKay said, &#8216;I feel certain that President George Q. Cannon and President Joseph F. Smith are near, for the veil is very thin.&#8217;&#8221; His son Hugh J. Cannon said in a choked voice, &#8220;There is no veil.&#8221;</p>
<p>After leaving the islands, Cannon started a weekly newspaper in San Francisco — The Western Standard — that served as a forum for defending the church. Later, he worked for the Deseret News and was editor from 1867 to 1874. Before serving in the islands, he worked for the Times and Seasons in Nauvoo, Ill.</p>
<p>At age 33, Cannon became an apostle. He served as a counselor to Presidents Brigham Young, John Taylor, Lorenzo Snow and Wilford Woodruff. He died on April 13, 1901.</p>

	AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF UTAH STATEHOOD HELPED<br />
  	 THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW WORLD RELIGION</p>
<p>	Mark W. Cannon </p>
<p>	February 28, 2002</p>
<p>This is a “big picture” approach to some key historic developments that contributed to the restored Church subsequently rising “out of obscurity.”, and to George Q. Cannon’s role in those developments,.		</p>
<p>The following themes will be explored:</p>
<p>1)  Despite historic reviling of the Mormons, the LDS Church is being recognized as a &#8220;new world religion&#8221;.</p>
<p>2)  How did George Q. Cannon’s Hawaiian Mission help lay the base for the remarkable world expansion of the Church?  </p>
<p>3)  Might Utah statehood have never come about?</p>
<p>4)  How was attaining Utah statehood, partially through George Q. Cannon&#8217;s strategic leadership, critical to building a new world religion?</p>
<p>5)  What other of his qualities helped build foundations for the emergence of the international Church?</p>
<p>6)  Concluding summary.</p>
<p>1)  Despite historic reviling of the restored Church, it is increasingly recognized as a &#8220;new world religion&#8221;.</p>
<p>As prophesied, the restored Church is coming &#8220;out of obscurity&#8221;,  and moving toward being taught to every nation, kindred, tongue and people.</p>
<p>A leading religious sociologist, Rodney Stark, inaugurated a national conference of religious researchers with the startling declaration that they had the unique opportunity to see the emergence of the first new world religion since Mohammed rode out into the desert some 1600 years ago. </p>
<p>Renowned Yale literature professor Harold Bloom calls himself  agnostic, yet he declared in his book, The American Religion:  &#8220;I&#8230;do not find it possible to doubt that Joseph Smith was an authentic prophet.  Where in all of American history can we find his match?&#8221;   </p>
<p>Bloom asserts:  &#8220;Mormonism&#8230;may prove decisive for this nation, and for more than this nation alone.   He writes: &#8220;No other American religious movement is so ambitious, and no rival even remotely approaches the spiritual audacity that drives endlessly toward accomplishing a titanic design.&#8221;   He projects hundreds of millions of Mormons in the new century.  </p>
<p>Another evidence of the Church coming &#8220;out of obscurity&#8221; is Joel Kotkin&#8217;s book on Tribes.  As ethnic ties have emerged as  powerful in the global economy, he focuses on five major tribes: the Jews, the British, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Indians.  These groups have in common a sense of mutual dependence, emphasis on family structure, a global network based on tribal trust that allows the group to function collectively, a passion for technology and a belief in scientific progress.  </p>
<p>Kotkin sees &#8220;Mormon models of thrift, sobriety and family values as more effective than traditional faiths&#8221; for upward mobile people in developing countries. </p>
<p>Assuming Mormons maintain coherence and growth, they &#8220;could conceivably emerge as the next great global tribe, fulfilling as they believe, the prophecies of ancient and modern prophets.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It is monumentally important that the Mormons would become the first multi-ethnic tribe – the first group that could bring vast numbers of ethnically diverse peoples into harmonious living with common constructive values. </p>
<p>One more indication of the emergence of the Church occurred when I was at a seminar with Peter Drucker at Harvard in 1989.  This institutional analyst, with gigantic stature, said: &#8220;The Mormons are the only Utopia that ever worked&#8221;. </p>
<p>Shifting to the mass media, the full color cover Sesquicentennial feature in Time concluded:  &#8220;The Church represents a combination of virtues that may make it the religion of America&#8217;s future.&#8221; </p>
<p>That all this emerged from a youth with little formal education (which astounds Harold Bloom) one and three quarters centuries ago is miraculous.   We can ask what laid the basis to produce this miracle.  </p>
<p>2)  How did George Q. Cannon’s Hawaiian Mission help lay the base for the remarkable world expansion of the Church?  </p>
<p>George Q. Cannon&#8217;s Hawaiian Mission was in some ways comparable to Peter&#8217;s history-changing vision that the Gospel was to go beyond the House of Israel to all people.  Though five other missionaries quit because Caucasians rejected the message, it was revealed to Elder Cannon that he should bring the Gospel to the Hawaiians.  He was a major force in some 4,000 baptisms, translating the Book of Mormon and making sure that Hawaiians held the Priesthood and became effective Church leaders.</p>
<p>How was the successful Hawaiian mission a launching pad for the international Church?  First, together with Tahitians, Hawaiians were the first large group of non-Caucasians to come into the Church, thereby implanting in the minds and hearts of Church members &#8212; early in their history &#8212; that the Gospel was for distant and different people who responded to the spirit.  </p>
<p>Second, the Hawaiian experience, which shaped George Q. Cannon’s life, embedded in him the deep conviction that all human beings are God&#8217;s children and must have our love and sympathetic understanding.  </p>
<p>One historic incident displayed George Q. Cannon&#8217;s instantaneous loving outreach.</p>
<p>Elders William Hansen and Harvey Carlisle started proselyting in Lillington, North Carolina in 1897.  They were arrested, imprisoned, and denied food and water unless they denounced their religion.  They refused and were told they would die.  Later, a group came to their cell, led by a tall, well-educated Black man, Postmaster Williams.  He asked:  &#8220;Do you know a man in Utah by the name of George Q. Cannon?&#8221;   The elders responded that they did and that Mr. Cannon was a member of the First Presidency of the Church.  &#8220;With that the colored man turned to the city officials and said, &#8216;Turn these men loose!&#8217;&#8221;  He then took the Elders to dinner and told them this story:</p>
<p>Several years ago, while I was walking in the Nation&#8217;s “Capitol a door was opened very suddenly which knocked my silk hat off my head and it fell to the floor.  A gentleman picked up my hat, took his handkerchief from his pocket, wiped the dust off, and in a very polite manner handed me my hat.  I said to this gentleman, ‘May I ask your name, and where you are from, and who taught you such manners as to stoop and pick up a colored man&#8217;s hat?&#8217;</p>
<p>The man informed me that his name was George Q. Cannon, that he was there representing&#8230;Utah, and that the Church of which he was a member taught&#8230;that we should respect all men, no matter what color or creed&#8230;, as we are all children of God&#8221;.   Mr. Williams promised to return the favor to other Mormons if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>According to Asian scholar and former Korean Temple President, Spencer Palmer, George Q. Cannon was decades ahead of his time in the breadth of his vision of a world wide Church for all people.   </p>
<p>Elder Cannon&#8217;s understanding that God loves and is involved with the entire human race is evidenced by his comments on the universality of revelation:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;there is no&#8230;[one] upon the face of the earth who has not the right and who has not obtained&#8230;revelations from God &#8230;.  Plato, Socrates, Confucius&#8230;received important truths from Him&#8230; </p>
<p>George Q. believed that &#8220;Mahomet&#8230;was a man raised up by the Almighty and inspired to a certain extent by Him&#8230;.  [Mahomet] attacked idolatry and restored the great and crowning idea that there is but one God.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;God has given great light and knowledge&#8230;to Luther and Calvin&#8230;and John Wesley&#8230;.  But this is the superiority that the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ possesses.  Its great Teacher is the Redeemer of the world.&#8221; </p>
<p>This remarkable breadth of George Q.&#8217;s vision of God&#8217;s involvement with every race and tribe influenced Church members because of President Cannon&#8217;s high level of service.  He was a counselor to Brigham Young, and the First Counselor to Presidents John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow.  Orson Whitney in his History of Utah concluded that &#8220;no man in Utah after the passing of Brigham Young wielded with all classes so great an influence as President George Q. Cannon.&#8221;                                   </p>
<p>The third implication of the Hawaiian Mission was to create an LDS bastion in the heart of the Pacific.  Diverse Asians came to Hawaii and some, or their descendants, joined the Church. The first Temple outside the continental U.S. made all ordinances available to people of the Pacific.  When Asian missions were opened after World War II, Hawaii provided missionaries who could understand the cultures of Asian countries, and sometimes their languages.  BYU Hawaii provided educational opportunities for Pacific Basin peoples to grow spiritually together, marry and build families within the Church, and create lasting friendship networks.</p>
<p>3)  Why might Utah statehood never have come about?</p>
<p>Many people today cannot imagine the intensity of political animosity toward the Mormons in the later decades of the 1800s.  A few facts show what a steep uphill battle it was to win statehood.</p>
<p>o  In 1862, the Morrill Act provided a $500 fine and up to five years in prison for any married person in U.S. territory that married another person.  It also prohibited the Church from owning more than $50,000 worth of property.</p>
<p>o  Fearing that Church property would be taken, Brigham Young transferred much of it to his estate.  Such writers as Irving Stone in Men to Match My Mountains imply that by leaving an estate of some $3 million, Brigham had exploited the Saints that he led.  However, George Q. Cannon was the Chief Executor of Brigham&#8217;s estate and suffered prison for three weeks rather than give up control over the estate, thereby protecting what belonged to the Church.  Less than a tenth went to Brigham&#8217;s numerous heirs.  </p>
<p>o  The propaganda war against the Mormons portrayed the Church as an &#8220;imperium in imperio&#8230;.as un-American in character; un-American in membership; insubordinate to the authority of the United States Government; flagrant in violating the anti-polygamy law.&#8221; </p>
<p>The intensity of the war against the Mormons was shown by use of such epithets as &#8220;inoculation of evil&#8221;, &#8220;poison&#8221;, &#8220;leprosy&#8221;, &#8220;pollution&#8221;, &#8220;stain&#8221;, &#8220;blot&#8221;, &#8220;virus&#8221;, and &#8220;cancer&#8221;.  The Mormon &#8220;impurity&#8221; had to be &#8220;obliterated&#8221;, &#8220;extirpated&#8221;, &#8220;destroyed&#8221;, &#8220;blotted out&#8221;, &#8220;crushed&#8221; or &#8220;blown out of existence&#8221;.  </p>
<p>o  The crusade against the Mormons drew such large crowds that former U.S. Vice President Schuyler Colfax (a beneficiary of the Credit Mobilier scandal) could denounce the Mormons to an audience of 50,000 people.  </p>
<p>o  Elections of Mormons to be Territorial Delegate were frequently contested in Congress by the loser, beginning in 1867 when William McGroarty with 105 votes contested the election of William Hooper with 15,074 votes.</p>
<p>o  George Q. Cannon was elected to Congress in 1872.  He and his Congressional friends derailed most anti-Mormon legislation.  However, the Poland Bill, after being stripped of its worst features by Senator Aaron Sargeant of California, was enacted in 1874.  It largely turned the Utah courts over to non-Mormons.   </p>
<p>o  Although Mormons contended that the Biblical practice of polygamy was allowed under Constitutional freedom of religion, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879 decided the contrary.  Chief Justice Waite paid little homage to religious action &#8212; as against opinion &#8212; that violated law, and paid no attention to the way polygamy was actually practiced and its positive eugenic results. </p>
<p>o  The Supreme Court decision encouraged anti-Mormon crusaders, which led to passage of the Edmunds Act of 1882, a powerful blow against the Saints.  This act: </p>
<p>-punished Mormon cohabitation;    								</p>
<p>-excluded believers in polygamy from juries;</p>
<p>-disqualified polygamists and cohabitors from voting or holding public office;</p>
<p>-controlled Utah elections. </p>
<p>-Congressional hypocrisy and intent to punish Mormons alone was displayed when Senator Morgan (D-Alabama) moved to apply the cohabitation penalties in the territories against concubines as well as against Mormon plural wives.  The amendment was rejected by forty-four votes to only seven in favor. </p>
<p>o  After passage of the Edmunds Act, the House of Representatives denied George Q. Cannon his seat.  The vote fell short of two thirds, which would have been required if the House had treated a Delegate as they would have treated a Member.</p>
<p>o  The Church leaders became moving targets of the Judicial Crusade, operating from an underground of secret locations. President John Taylor, for example, died in an obscure home in Kaysville in 1887.</p>
<p>o  Rewards were offered for the capture of Church leaders and several went to prison, including George Q. Cannon,  where he wrote Life of Joseph Smith the Prophet. </p>
<p>o  In 1887, the Edmunds-Tucker Act was passed.  In a nation that exalts the right of private corporations, the L.D.S. Church was disincorporated.  In a country that exalts the right of private property, all but $50,000 of Church property was to be escheated and used for schools.  In a nation that exalts the right of citizens to vote, voting was denied to those who would not sign an anti-polygamy test oath.  Gentiles soon took over the Ogden and Salt Lake City governments.</p>
<p>o  The Territory of Idaho enacted a law that denied the vote to all Mormons by a test oath that the prospective voter was not a member of any organization teaching its devotees to commit bigamy or polygamy.  </p>
<p>o  Even worse, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Idaho statute in Davis v. Beason on February 3, 1890.   Chief Justice Warren Burger once told me that Davis v. Beason, more than any other case that he had ever read, reflected the personal views and prejudices of the Justices, rather than careful constitutional reasoning.  </p>
<p>4)  How was attaining Utah statehood, partially through George Q. Cannon&#8217;s strategic leadership, critical to the foundation of building a new world religion?</p>
<p>Had a reconciliation not been worked out, the Church could have been in extremely dire straights.  Statehood for Utah might have been indefinitely lost.  Utah could have become a permanent territory and might have been treated somewhat like an Indian Reservation, but under the tight control of politically appointed carpetbaggers.  Utah also could have been carved up and given to other states, so that no state had a majority LDS population.</p>
<p>Although polygamy was far from the most causal issue producing the anti-Mormon crusade, it was the most highly visible, and non-Mormon leaders made clear there would never be statehood and the crusade would continue until the polygamy issue was resolved.  George Q. Cannon, First Counselor to President Wilford Woodruff discussed these issues frequently with him.  President Woodruff, a particularly spiritual Prophet, pondered, prayed and waited for inspiration of the Lord, which came on September 20, 1890.  </p>
<p>This led to President Woodruff&#8217;s &#8220;Official Declaration&#8221; to abide by the law forbidding plural marriages.   In supporting the Manifesto at the Church Conference, George Q. Cannon explained that it had come from God because it had become necessary to yield to the demands of the country in order to save the people.  George Q. pointed to scripture that if every effort were made to carry out a commandment and it was still impossible to adhere to it, the person receiving the commandment would be absolved of responsibility.</p>
<p>The issuance of the Manifesto alone was insufficient to obtain Utah Statehood.  This was suggested in 1887 &#8212; the sixth statehood convention produced a proposed State Constitution stating that &#8220;bigamy and polygamy being considered incompatible with a republican form of government, each of them is hereby forbidden and declared a misdemeanor.&#8221;  Nevertheless, that failed to produce statehood. </p>
<p>George Q. Cannon, sometimes referred to as &#8220;The Mormon Premier&#8221;  or &#8220;The Mormon Richelieu&#8221;  was the chief strategist and negotiator, for such matters as dividing Church members into political parties, persuading national political leaders that they should not offend the quarter of a million Mormons who could influence many intermountain area elections, persuading skeptical political leaders that the Church would not function as a theocracy, and negotiating with former Congressional friends such as Secretary of State James G. Blaine, a leading Republican.  Decades of effort for statehood led to successful culmination in 1896.   Elder B.F. Cummings described Elder Cannon as &#8220;the greatest master of practical statecraft the Church had produced.&#8221; </p>
<p>It would be hard to exaggerate how important Utah statehood, to which President Cannon contributed significantly, was to the growth of the Church and its ultimate emergence as a new world religion.  Let us explore some of the ways this was the case.</p>
<p>o  Back to the mission of the Church.  The Church was able to refocus energy on religious objectives.  For example, more than twice as many missionaries, 11,503, were set apart in the quarter century after statehood as during the quarter century preceding, 5,089. </p>
<p>o  The lepers became leaders.  With statehood, the outcast Mormons elected Members of the House and Senate, without trying to monopolize those positions.   Although the election of an Apostle, Reed Smoot, to the U.S. Senate in 1902 was controversial, his emergence into a powerful and respected Senate leader, as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and his political leadership for 30 years, symbolized the transition of Mormons from pariahs to an unusual, but still acceptable, part of America.  </p>
<p>o  Smoot diligently helped many hundreds of talented Mormons obtain government positions in Washington, who, without his presence, might not have made it because of the stigma on Mormons in that era.  Because Smoot&#8217;s young people performed well, he was sometimes asked to supply more of those bright young people.  Many went on to influential positions in government, such as Edgar Brossard, who was appointed to the Federal Tariff Commission by five Presidents from 1925 to 1959, and long served as its chairman.  Similarly, Rosel Hyde came to Washington to attend George Washington Law School at night and work for the government during the day.  He served on the Federal Communications Commission from 1946 to 1969, much of that time as its chairman.  </p>
<p>Others went on to influential positions in business. For example, Smoot&#8217;s last secretary, Isaac &#8220;Ike&#8221; Stewart, became Vice President of Union Carbide and President of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  Stan McAllister, became Vice President of Lord and Taylor in New York, and helped the Church in that area.  </p>
<p>Smoot helped an active Church member, William M. Jardine, become the first Mormon appointed to a cabinet position as Secretary of Agriculture in 1925.  He subsequently became President of Kansas State University.  Hal G. Smith of the New York Times, who covered Washington for nearly 40 years, attributed Smoot&#8217;s success in placing people not to a machine or any nefarious activity, but to his long service, party position, and the generally superior quality of the people he recommended. 	</p>
<p>Smoot&#8217;s demonstration that Mormons were acceptable parts of the government probably helped lay the base for the first Mormon appointed to a subcabinet position, even though that person was a Democrat and had run against Smoot for the Senate.  This was James D. Moyle who became Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1917.  This may also have resulted partially from the fact that Moyle’s boss,  Secretary of the Treasury William McAdoo, while a law student, had been required to defend the Mormons in a successful debate.  He had obtained ideas and information from Territorial Delegate George Q. Cannon and became friendly toward the Mormons while developing his case. </p>
<p>Incidentally, Smoot was at least equally encouraging to non-Mormons in helping them find jobs in the Capital.   For example, Smoot persuaded President Harding to appoint former U.S. Senator from Utah George Sutherland, a non-Mormon graduate of BYU, to the U.S. Supreme Court.  </p>
<p>Other Mormon Senators from Utah have followed Smoot’s model.  For example, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch was one of the highest Senators in placing appointees in the Reagan Administration.</p>
<p>The tradition of Mormons coming to Washington and often staying there, that resulted from statehood, has led to the greater Washington, D.C. area having 19 stakes.  This is one of the largest concentrations of Mormons east of Utah.  Mormons are in the three branches of government, law firms and associations that influence government, and think tanks that study government policies.</p>
<p>o  Smoot focused his indefatigable energy primarily on his political role.  However, when the Church needed help he gave it.  For example, after World War I, Great Britain and European countries excluded Mormon missionaries, by refusing them visas.  In 1919, George Albert Smith, wrote from England that the Church was being almost smothered by persecution, and the exclusion of missionaries.  He questioned whether the Church could survive in Europe.  Senator Smoot enlisted the U.S. Secretary of State, and they both sent many cables pressing for the granting of visas to missionaries.  He also met with the British and other European ambassadors.  Agreements resulted, but were only partially kept.  So, in 1923 Smoot toured England, France, Germany and Scandinavia.  He met with media baron Lord Beaverbrook and was pleased with published interviews in major newspapers in London and the continent.  He was featured as the powerful Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.  He met with the highest officials of each country where he pressed for consistent granting of visas.  That ended the problems.  </p>
<p>Since then, there have been many meetings with Utah Senators and other LDS public officials and foreign ambassadors to get or to keep missionaries in foreign countries.  Examples of the results include Communist Hungary’s acceptance of missionaries, the early recognition of the Church in the Soviet Union and  allowing missionaries to function in Russia after a new law that could have been interpreted to exclude them (a commitment encouraged by a visit of Senator Robert Bennett to Moscow, with the approval of the U.S. State Department) and allowing missionaries into Ghana after they had been prohibited.  Sometimes non-Mormon leaders have been enlisted to help.  </p>
<p>Most Islamic countries do not permit religious missionaries.  However, Mormons have developed good relations with many Islamic officials by coordinating efforts to protect traditional family values from groups pressuring the United Nations in other directions.  In addition, Islamic leaders have expressed appreciation at dinners for BYU’s long term Islamic Translation Series which translate into English, for the first time, respected Islamic Texts.  The first presentation to Islamic leaders from Washington embassies and, in New York, United Nations representatives was Al-Ghazali’s The Incoherence of the Philosophers.  Former Utah State Senate President Karl Snow handled liaison with U.N. Representatives in New York.</p>
<p>Beverly Campbell and Ann Santini have been liaison to ambassadors, and have brought several dozen ambassadors and high embassy officials to such events as:  the annual BYU Management Society Dinner in Washington, D.C.; the annual Festival of Lights where in 1998 the Chinese Ambassador turned on more than 300,000 Christmas lights at the Temple Visitors Center and made especially positive comments about the Mormons; the annual Western Family Picnic at the Marriott Ranch in Hume, Virginia which is a virtually unique diplomatic event since ambassadors bring their families and which was attended by representatives of 53 countries with 28 ambassadors on September 25, 1999; and a presentation by the Polynesian Cultural Center on the Maryland estate of Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon which attracted 14 Pacific Basin Ambassadors the evening of June 8, 1999. </p>
<p>Smoot also took Church leaders such as Presidents Joseph F. Smith and Heber J. Grant to meet with Presidents of the United States at the White House, as well as introduced them to cabinet members to keep friendly relationships and encourage communication.  Senator Smoot helped arrange Presidential visits.  He persuaded William Howard Taft to visit Utah twice and to meet with Church leaders.  Taft was the first President of the United States to speak in the Tabernacle.  President Warren G. Harding and Woodrow Wilson also spoke in the Tabernacle.  </p>
<p>During the revolution in Mexico, Smoot got protective aid to the Mormon colonies.  </p>
<p>Elder Smoot held Church in his home on Sundays, until the 1920&#8242;s, when he helped negotiate the land for a highly visible Mormon chapel, with a gold-covered statue of Moroni on top located on 16th street, north of the White House.  </p>
<p>o Ask yourself the question: Is it likely that there would have been even one Mormon U.S. Senator in Washington had the Church remained in New York, Ohio, Missouri or Illinois and been a small minority population?  Winning the Utah statehood battle enabled 11 LDS Senators to be elected from Utah, and an additional 6 have been elected largely from neighboring states.   The persecution of the Mormons, though deplorable, moved the Saints to a desolate area in which they could be a majority in what ultimately became a state &#8212; which provided the opportunity to build extraordinary political leverage.  This history could not easily have been more brilliantly planned to achieve the end goal of building a strong Washington base that helped bring status and positive visibility to the Church as well as the ability to plead effectively with foreign governments to allow missionaries freedom to proselyte.</p>
<p>My close observation of the Mormon political community since the 1950&#8242;s indicates that Utah’s statehood not only produced Mormon Senators, but they became role models for many young Mormons who entered politics in States outside of Utah.  Also, Mormon Senators made it acceptable in many people&#8217;s minds for Mormons to hold high elective positions.  This led to the election of active LDS Senators Harry Reid from Nevada (currently Senate Majority Whip), Gordon Smith from Oregon, and Michael Crapo of Idaho, and previously, Paula Hawkins from Florida.  Incidentally, she was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate who was neither the wife nor the daughter of a politician.  There was also a near miss by Dick Swett in New Hampshire. It led to there being 11 current LDS Members of the House of Representatives, including Delegate Eni Faleomavaega of American Samoa, and George Q. Cannon&#8217;s great grandson, Christopher B. Cannon from Utah.    </p>
<p>o  The fact that an Apostle served in the Senate for thirty years set a precedent that facilitated the naming of a later Apostle, Ezra Taft Benson, as Secretary of Agriculture for eight years.  He accomplished the seemingly impossible &#8212; moving much of American agriculture from regimentation toward free markets.</p>
<p>o  Utah Statehood has also led to there being over 200 LDS staff members in the Congress.  This makes at least a modest contribution to Congressional defense of legitimate LDS needs.  For example, when religious extremists in Israel were threatening to stop the development of the strikingly beautiful BYU Center in Jerusalem, Congressman Tom Lantos was persuaded by LDS Congressman Wayne Owens to be a leader in a drive that obtained some 200 signatures of House Members on a petition that helped make sure that the BYU center was allowed to be completed and to function.  Senator Orrin Hatch and his assistant, Frank Madsen, led the fight in the Senate.  For Congressman Lantos, a Jewish Democratic Congressman from California, this fit his ideological commitments to freedom of the mind, and the free exchange of ideas.  However, it did not hurt that his wife was a convert to the Church and his Administrative Assistant, BYU alumnus Robert King, is LDS. </p>
<p>5)  How else did George Q. Cannon help build the foundation for the emergence of the international Church.</p>
<p>We will mention a few of the other ways that George Q. Cannon contributed to foundations for future Church growth.    </p>
<p>First, he articulated positions of the Church eloquently and persuasively in speeches and writings.  As Editor of the Deseret News, he converted it into a daily newspaper.  He wrote over 1000 editorials for the Juvenile Instructor which he founded and edited for 35 years.  He wrote many hundreds of editorials in the Western Standard, Millennial Star and Deseret News.  More than 300 of his discourses were printed.   President Gordon B. Hinckley has said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know of a man, really, who had a better understanding of the doctrine, of the government, of the principles of the Church than did George Q. Cannon.  Among the three or four books outside the Standard Works to which I turn most frequently, is the volume Gospel Truth containing the statements of George Q. Cannon.&#8221; </p>
<p>Second, he made friends for the Church wherever he went.  It was after interviewing him and seeing the boatload of British Mormons that he was supervising that Charles Dickens called the Mormons, much to his surprise, &#8220;the pick and flower of England.&#8221; </p>
<p>Third, with little formal schooling, he became highly educated through relentless reading and he strongly encouraged education among the Saints to build their knowledge and skills.  He promoted the creation of centers of education.  He offered the dedicatory prayer for the Brigham Young Academy lower campus education building (1892) whose facade is now preserved while the inside has been made into an ultra-modern library, which exhibits his photo, bio and dedicatory prayer.   He was chairman of its Board of Trustees from 1897 until he died in 1901.  He strongly supported education for both sexes and initiated and edited the Juvenile Instructor, the first children’s magazine in the Intermountain West (1866).  He helped organize and was the first General Superintendent of the Sunday School Union of the Church (1867).  President Heber J. Grant wrote &#8220;there has been no other man in Utah who has shown such marked ability in so many different ways as has he&#8230;the broad educational views held by President Cannon entitle him to be ranked as one of the foremost men from an educational standpoint that Utah has ever produced.&#8221;   The Church&#8217;s promotion of education and science that George Q. Cannon&#8217;s activities represented contributed to Utah regularly producing more scientists and Ph.D.s than any other state in relation to population.  </p>
<p>Fourth, he married talented wives and replenished the earth with descendants who served missions and tried to represent the Gospel in their professions.  Those helped into the Church by the descendants of George Q. and of his brothers and sisters, and the chains of people that those new members helped convert may well exceed a quarter of a million people.  Probably the closest single parallel in subsequent Church history to the massive baptisms performed in Hawaii by Elder Cannon and his associates was done by his grandson Ted Cannon and Rendall Mabey, who baptized about 1,700 people in opening up the West African Mission in the 1970s.  A great grandson of George Q. Cannon played a role in the baptism of a Nigerian pastor who aspires to bring his congregations of thousands into the Church.</p>
<p>President Gordon Hinckley said:  &#8220;Perhaps no man in the history of the Church has produced a family such as the descendants of George Q. Cannon.  They have been Church leaders, yes, but there have been Cannons who have served with distinction in almost every walk of life&#8230;.  They have made a tremendous contribution to the Church, and to the society in which they have been a part.&#8221; </p>
<p>5) Concluding Summary.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Mormons have gone through a remarkable transformation from being viewed predominantly as a strange, tiny, authoritarian,  narrowminded group to becoming increasingly recognized by intellectual observers as an unusual, tightly organized, significant, dynamic world religion, which helps resolve many human problems.  </p>
<p>Two important factors that helped make this transformation possible are the early successful Hawaiian Mission and the achievement of statehood for Utah.   </p>
<p>George Q. Cannon’s successful Hawaiian mission, with Hawaiians being ordained to the Priesthood and becoming spiritual leaders led to feelings of community and brotherhood by the Utah Saints with people from very different racial and cultural backgrounds, This helped Mormons sustain future expansion of the Church into other racial and cultural groups.  It also embedded in George Q. the conviction that all of God’s children are important, can and do receive revelation and should be reached by the Gospel.  Not only was he universally minded, but his strong leadership and speaking and writing responsibilities educated Church members with his universal emphases.  Furthermore, the successful Hawaiian Mission created a stronghold that helped expand the Church into Asian countries after World War II.  </p>
<p>Another major rocket launcher for the emergence of a new world religion was winning, with George Q. Cannon’s strategic leadership, the seemingly impossible battle for Utah statehood.  This had a cascading effect.  Statehood itself produced some degree of acceptability.  The election of Mormon Senators and Representatives shifted Mormons from being excluded to entering into positions of policy and political influence, brought further acceptance of Church members, and helped many other LDS gain positions in Washington that ultimately led to their obtaining political and economic leadership.  </p>
<p>These role models stimulated many other Mormons to enter politics and seek and sometimes obtain positions of influence, and helped attract a very large LDS population, many of whom are influential, in or near the nation’s capitol.  All of this has led to the election of five current Mormon Senators and 12 previous ones, as well as 11 current Mormon members of the House of Representatives and 46 previous ones.   This strong Mormon presence, much of which would never have existed without winning the battle of statehood for Utah, facilitated positive and effective communication with foreign ambassadors and leaders which helps keep the missionaries in most countries in the world and helps protect against persecution of members in most countries where they live.  This is important for the future since efforts are growing in many countries to restrict the rights of non-traditional churches.</p>
<p>This strong Mormon presence in the most powerful capital in the world also promotes a flow of cosmopolitan perceptions and information back to Salt Lake City.  These influential Washington based Mormons also facilitate positive communications and images in the national and foreign media, and create connections with many powerful decision makers.  One thing that facilitates Mormon influence is that unlike many interest groups, Mormons are not soliciting Federal subsidies, but are seeking the freedom to worship and share their views in the market place of ideas &#8212; both of which are central to the American constitutional ethos.  All of these factors have been important to the emergence of the new world religion.</p>
<p>Many millions of people have been killed by ethnic hatreds and wars. Thus, the LDS emergence as a well-functioning multi-ethnic religion (though not without adjustment problems) with a dwindling proportion of Caucasian members, is noteworthy.  If it continues to succeed in the challenge of harmonizing such diverse cultures as it continues to grow, other institutions may wish to examine that model.</p>

9. As just one example, many Blacks have joined the Church in the Menlo Park Stake.  One Black convert, Aaron Johnson, who teaches  the High Priests in his ward, has said that the LDS Church has less race prejudice than any other organization he has ever observed.  He believes the only way racial reconciliation will come is through the Church.  The Stake has taken on the commitment of making sure that no student in the Stake is deprived of higher education or training because of financial need.  Based on Gospel values, LDS businessmen created and funded Beechwood, an elementary school for underprivileged students.  The school requires parents to take a parenting class and work regularly with their children.  Despite alarmingly low high school graduation rates in the area, the first class to have completed preschool through the eighth grade are now high school graduates, and almost all of the Beechwood alumni will graduate from high school.  Many will go on to higher education.  One present and one recent Bishop in this Stake are married to Asians.

Even such noted historians as Morison and Commager, in a history text used until after World War II, dismissed Mormons as having remained near to the low &#8220;cultural level from which they were recruited&#8221; and as being &#8220;barren in the arts&#8221; and &#8220;too autocratic for wholesome civic life.&#8221;  Samuel Eliot Morison and Henry Steele Commager, The Growth of the American Republic, 2 vols.

Cannon has for a long time been one of my favorites among the stalwart brethren of the Church&#8230;.  He served as counselor to four presidents of the Church.  His published teachings are a literal gold mine of the doctrine of this Church.  He had remarkable capacity for saying things in a way that made them very easy to understand.  His testimony was strong and secure&#8230;.  He communed with the Lord Jesus Christ, and it had a wonderful pattern upon his life&#8230;I&#8217;ve said it as a non-Cannon, that I think perhaps the George Q. Cannon family has produced more men and women of talents and ability and capacity than any other family in the Church.  They have literally produced generals, ambassadors, architects, lawyers, doctors, merchants&#8230;.  I have admired them for a long long time and the tremendous contribution which they made to the Church and significantly most of them have kept the faith and made a great contribution to this Church and moved this work forward in the world.  Thanks to the Cannon family.&#8221;</p>
