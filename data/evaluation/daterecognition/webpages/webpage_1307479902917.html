What&#8217;s left after you&#8217;ve donned the must-have-not dresses of the season, forked over your cash, and fake-smiled your way through countless photos? After you&#8217;ve dealt with the smashed guest, the smooshed cake, the dashed hopes, and the missed bouquets? That&#8217;s what Cate Padgett is starting to wonder, as she embarks on stint after stint on the sidelines, watching friends swap bar-hopping for baby-naming&#8230;while her own love life goes nowhere fast. But is Cate unwilling to settle down-or just unwilling to settle? And can anyone really judge her if they haven&#8217;t walked in her dyed-to-match shoes? Wild, witty, and full of weddings to cry over, Always the Bridesmaid is an endearingly romantic comedy about standing out in the crowd even when everyone&#8217;s wearing the same celery-green dress&#8230;and daring to make every day The Happiest Day of Your Life</em>.</p>

				<div class="entry">
										<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13079" title="katewilliam" src="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/katewilliam.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="277" />Yesterday, one of the biggest events in the world took place as HRH Prince William married his girlfriend of 8 years, Kate Middleton, who he met at University. The engagement was announced last October, and with a wedding date soon set for April 29th 2011, the world started to get excited at the prospect of a huge Royal Wedding, and boy is that what we got! We sat eagerly with bated breath at around 10.20am waiting for our first glimpse of the bridegroom, and what a handsome pair both he and his brother Prince Harry were in their military regalia. Both looked very nervous as they arrived at Westminster Abbey, and soon attentions of the press turned to the bride, Kate Middleton as she emerged from the Goring Hotel.</p>
<p><a href="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/katem.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-13078" title="katem" src="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/katem.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="550" /></a>As soon as we saw her, I knew she&#8217;d made the perfect choice. She looked elegant, under-stated yet absolutely perfect in her Sarah Burton wedding gown, the lace at the top making the traditional white satin gown a little special and more beautiful. She wore a tiara leant to her by Queen Elizabeth and looked radiant sat in the car with her father on the way to become Mrs William Windsor, and our new Royal Princess. The wedding ceremony itself went seamlessly, with the pair giving their vows, followed by several hymns and then the walk back down the aisle as man and wife.</p>
<p>Upon marriage, the newly titled Duke and Duchess of Cambridge paraded around London back to Buckingham Palace in the carriage used previously by his mother Princess Diana and his father Prince Charles at their wedding back in 1981. After a short hiatus, the newlyweds appeared on the balcony of the palace for their first official appearance as husband and wife and looked so happy, it was like watching every little girl&#8217;s dream come true when they appeared! Soon, they gave each other a public kiss to roars from the crowds gathered in front of them, and watched a flypast from military aircraft before sneaking in another kiss!</p>
<p>Although I was looking forward to the Royal Wedding, I didn&#8217;t realise how excited I was until it all started to unfold on television this morning, and Kate emerging from the hotel really made me think what a fairytale it all was and how privileged I felt to be a small part of their big day with them. Britain has embraced the new Royal couple wonderfully, welcoming them into the monarchy, and as <a href="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/katewillskiss.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-13080 alignleft" title="katewillskiss" src="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/katewillskiss.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="311" /></a>Catherine is one destined to be Queen, it is important that we like and respect them for what they are going to do in their new roles as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.</p>
<p>It is lovely to see the impact that the Royal Wedding has had all over the world as well, not just in the UK but everywhere, across the Commonwealth to the USA who seem Kate and William crazy! An estimated 2 billion people worldwide watched the pair tie the knot, and I think this says a lot about how much we all crave our fairytale happy ever after, just like Catherine has got. It really is like a chick-lit novel come to life&#8230; normal girl meets a Prince, they fall in love and live happily ever after. Dreams can come true after all, and we send Catherine and William love and happiness in their new marriage hoping for a wonderful Happy Ever After!</p>

Kate has landed her Prince, but how about presenting a tongue-in-cheek Chick Lit guide to snagging a prince. Every day at mid-day, from Monday until Friday we&#8217;ll give you five steps to getting your own Happy Ever After.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Step Five: Happy Ever After?</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve successfully navigated the five steps to snagging a Prince. You&#8217;ve got him &#8211; obviously, you&#8217;ve impressed his friends and family, you&#8217;ve moved in together and best of all, he&#8217;s proposed. Your wedding will be a big affair, think Katie Price; big church, thousands (ok hundreds) of guests, big meringue-y dress. Not to mention your wedding is taking place in Venice. Thankfully though, you&#8217;ve avoided any pitfalls. Neither your mother nor his mother tried to take over, you&#8217;ve only booked one wedding, and for once in your life, everything goes swimmingly. You&#8217;re a princess on the day, your groom&#8217;s eyes light up as soon as he sees you and he looks a vision himself in his tux (but then again, who doesn&#8217;t look good in a tux?). You honeymoon on a cruise around the Carribbean and conceive a magical, precious baby. Your life couldn&#8217;t possibly get any better and as you and your Prince celebrate 50 years of marriage, it tells us only one thing: that the Chick Lit guide to snagging a Prince is worth its weight in gold dust. Who said fiction never teaches us anything?</p>

One author who kindly agreed to tell us about her wedding (and what a fab day it sounded like!) was the lovely Victoria Connelly, take it away Victoria!:</strong></p>
<p>Fourteenth-century Bolton Castle in the Yorkshire Dales might not be everyone’s idea of the perfect wedding venue – Mary Queen of Scots was held prisoner there and many of the rooms haven’t even got a roof &#8211; but my fiancé and I knew it was the place for us.  It sits in the middle of Wensleydale with sweeping views of the National Park, and a tour of the castle showed that the main ceremony would take place in the Great Chamber and we could have the fire lit.</p>
<p>We visited the castle the day before the wedding, making sure the deliveries of chairs, tables and wine had arrived, and it was then that we noticed that there was no electricity in the castle!  Our ceremony was to take place late in the afternoon with the reception in the evening.  What were we going to do without lights?  Would the fire and candles I’d ordered be enough?</p>
<p>I spent the night before the wedding in a lovely B&amp;B in Askrigg – the village made famous by the TV show All Creatures Great and Small – and it was from there that we drove to the castle through the Dales in an ancient Jaguar driven by an ancient driver who’d just had triple bypass surgery.  Luckily, we all made it to the castle intact but my uncle followed in his car just in case ours broke down!</p>
<p><a href="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Wedding.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12931" title="Wedding" src="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Wedding.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></a>I’d helped design my wedding dress which was based on the Tudor portraits I loved so much (this was many years before the famous TV series!)  My gown had long trumpet sleeves and a square, jewelled neckline and a double skirt.  It was wonderfully heavy and we had to take it slowly climbing the spiral staircase to the Great Chamber!</p>
<p>I had two bridesmaids: my best friend and my new sister-in-law.  Both wore pretty burgundy gowns and carried bouquets of white roses.  My bouquet was a fountain of white lilies and deep red roses.</p>
<p>My husband was wearing a black nehru jacket with a burgundy cravat and  waistcoat.  He looked so handsome!</p>
<p>I’ll never forget the scent of the stargazer lilies in front of the fire in the Great Chamber, and the moment when Roy placed my wedding ring on my finger.  It has never been taken off since!</p>
<p>We had a lovely lady to play the harp and one of the funniest photos we have is of her manoeuvring the harp up the spiral staircase with the help of the caterer’s son.</p>
<p>Another magical moment was when Roy and I entered the Great Chamber once it had been set for the dinner.  The candles on the tables had been lit and the fire glowed brightly.  We were so thrilled that the castle didn’t have electricity!</p>
<p>We’d hired a mobile disco which had been set up in another room and we were delighted to discover a bat circling the dance floor!</p>
<p>Last September, we celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary.  I wish we could have relived our wedding day all over again but one thing is for sure – I shall never forget it!</p>

										<p><a href="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Royalwedding-week2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-12355" title="Royalwedding week2" src="http://chicklitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Royalwedding-week2.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a>The lovely Veronica Henry has kindly written us a fabulous short story for our <strong>Royal Wedding Week</strong> so without further ado, please enjoy the brilliant &#8216;A Right Royal Do&#8217;!</p>
<p>&#8220;The table looked perfect.  It was groaning with food.  Home-made sausage rolls and cheese straws.  Crown-shaped biscuits piped with intricate icing and studded with shining sugar jewels.  A magnificent Victoria sponge.  A bowl of spicy creamy Coronation chicken flanked by potato salad and crisp fresh lettuce.  Patriotic, English classics fit for the wedding of a prince and his bride.  A right royal do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sally stood back and surveyed it proudly. She’d gone to town, and her friends teased her.  They didn’t know she was such a Royalist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘I’m not,’ she replied, ‘but I’m not going to sit here on my own sobbing into my Cup a Soup.  I want a celebration.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The preparations had taken her mind off things.  She’d had to embrace the royal wedding totally, in order to forget that this was supposed to be her day, too.  She’d ordered bunting, and Union Jack napkins, and glittery crowns for them all to wear.  Decorated her tiny little garden flat with red, white and blue.  And tried not to think about the all the things she had ordered for her own wedding, all the things that had been sent back, cancelled, returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The planning had taken months.  When Sally and Richard booked the date, they hadn’t known that William and Kate were going to choose the same day and they’d giggled with glee when they found out.  What a stroke of luck that their wedding day was to be a national holiday and that none of their friends would have to book the day off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the minute the Royal Wedding date was announced, Sally knew people would be making comparisons between her dress and Kate’s, but she had always known what she wanted to wear and didn’t let it put her off. A strapless sheath of cream silk, embroidered with a thick band of pearls around the neckline.  Her hair up in a simple twist, a single cream rose in the knot, matching the ones in her bouquet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple.  Elegant.  Her dream come true.  It was going to be perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then a national paper had contacted them.  Wanted to follow their plans, as a comparison to Will and Kate.  Richard had baulked at the idea, but Sally had pointed out that the money they were offering would more than pay for their honeymoon in the Maldives.  So they’d agreed.  Week by week, their progress was charted, all the minutiae spilled out for the world to read.  Sally didn’t care.  ‘It’ll just be our friends and family, on the day,’ she assured Richard.  That had been part of the deal.  Privacy on the day itself.  After all, no-one was going to be interested come 29<sup>th</sup> April.  All eyes would be on Westminster Abbey, not the registry office in Malvern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, however, her dress was sitting in the designer’s show room, with a discreet ‘For Sale’ sign pinned to it.  Someone would buy it.  The designer wouldn’t reveal that the previous owner had been jilted, as a potential purchaser might think that was bad luck.  She would pass it off as a sample, and Sally would get some of her two thousand pounds back.  Six hundred pearls sewn on by hand didn’t come cheap, even if they weren’t real.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There were five bridesmaids’ dresses for sale too, in dove grey satin, but the designer didn’t hold out as much hope for finding a buyer. ‘Tricky,’ she’d said ‘finding five bridesmaids exactly the same size.’  Claire, Millie, Amber, Freya and Jess.  They were all coming over today to watch.  They’d be here any minute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be fair, Richard had given her the money to cover any loss.  It was the least he could do.  Pulling out of a wedding four weeks before was unforgivable.  He hadn’t given her a particular reason.  He just didn’t feel ready, he said.  There was no other woman, he promised her, and Sally had no reason to disbelieve him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was, she supposed, better than being left at the altar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humiliating, nevertheless.  And of course she was devastated, bewildered, wondered what on earth she had done wrong.  But her friends had been wonderful.  They’d taught her just how important friendship is.  She could get through life without Richard as long as she had them by her side.  And here they were now – the buzzer of her flat was ringing.  She ran to open the door, and they bounded in, in a flurry of hair and perfume and laughter and hugs.  She felt warm as she passed them each a strawberry champagne cocktail and turned on her television.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the BBC commentary began, and they watched the coach begin its journey, Sally felt a lump rise in her throat.  It wasn’t self pity.  Instead, it was the emotion that even the most stony-hearted would surely feel on this joyous day.  She felt happy for the beautiful young girl about to start the next chapter of her life, and silently prayed that she would find the contentment that had eluded her mother-in-law, that she and the Prince would fill the Royal nursery with fat, happy laughing babies and live happily ever after.  And she prayed that the marriage would be able to withstand the media pressure.  She and Richard had only had a taste of that pressure, and their relationship hadn’t survived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claire sidled up to her.  She had never designated her so, because to her all her friends were equal, but in Sally’s heart Claire was her chief bridesmaid, the one who really was there for her at all hours of the day and night.  The one who had texted her at eleven o’clock the night before to make sure she wasn’t in a drunken, snivelling heap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Are you ok?’ whispered Claire.  They had all agreed ‘not to mention the war’.  It was bad enough that there were going to be wedding celebrations shoved down the nation’s throat all day long, without rubbing Sally’s nose in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Yes,’ said Sally, picking up her glass, and Claire gave her a squeeze as they watched the bride walk down the aisle, the most moving part of any wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, Sally thought, my prince will come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two hours later, the ceremony over, the dress dissected and swooned over, the six of them sat at Sally’s table, stuffed with champagne and cake, giggling and gossiping, when the buzzer went again.  Sally frowned, no idea who it could be.  She made her way to the door, slightly woozy from all the sugar and alcohol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind it she found an enormous bunch of cream roses, just like the ones she had chosen for her wedding bouquet.  There must have been fifty.  And behind them, Richard.  She blinked in astonishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘I’m so sorry,’ he said.  ‘I know I did the worst thing that a man can do to a girl.  But I just couldn’t hack it.  It was those bloody journalists, asking if I thought I was doing the right thing.  If I thought the 29<sup>th</sup> of April was ‘cursed’, because of Diana.  If I thought my marriage would last longer than Will and Kate’s.  They kept throwing me statistics, about how many marriages end up in divorce.  I got cold feet.  I panicked.  I didn’t want to get married only for it all to end in tears.  But I miss you.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sally leant against the wall, feeling faint.  He smiled at her, his brown eyes totally sincere, the mouth she’d kissed so many times curled up in a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘You jilted me,’ she said.  ‘The whole country knows.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘That was the problem!’ Richard shot back.  ‘The whole country knew everything.  Even what pants I was wearing under my morning suit!’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was true.  Sally had revealed she had bought Richard a pair of Hugo Boss boxer shorts to wear on the day. The journalist running the feature had been delighted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘That’s just the sort of detail we need,’ she’d said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Richard stepped forward, then dropped to his knees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is,’ he said.  ‘I want to marry you.  But I want it small.  Private.  No papers.  No publicity.  No fuss.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five mouths at the table fell open as Sally considered what he was saying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘I watched the wedding this morning,’ he went on, impassioned, ‘and I realised that should have been us as well.  I love you, Sally.  Please marry me.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She could feel five pairs of eyes on her as she considered her reply.  The fact that they were remaining silent, and not one of them had stepped forward to object, said it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘There’s just one condition,’ she said eventually, and pointed behind her.  ‘This lot. I want this lot to come.  I’m not getting married without them.  No way.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Course not,’ he grinned in reply.  ‘I’ve always known they were part of the package.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he stepped inside, and took her in his arms, dropping the roses to the floor, as a thunderous round of applause broke out, accompanied by party blowers and whistles and whoops of delight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My prince <em>has</em> come, Sally thought, as she wrapped her arms around his familiar form and squeezed him as tightly as she could.</p>

<div id="_mcePaste" class="mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">The table looked perfect. It was groaning with food. Home-made sausage rolls<br />
and cheese straws. Crown-shaped biscuits piped with intricate icing and studded<br />
with shining sugar jewels. A magnificent Victoria sponge. A bowl of spicy creamy<br />
Coronation chicken flanked by potato salad and crisp fresh lettuce. Patriotic, English<br />
classics fit for the wedding of a prince and his bride. A right royal do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sally stood back and surveyed it proudly. She’d gone to town, and her friends teased<br />
her. They didn’t know she was such a Royalist.</p>
<p>‘I’m not,’ she replied, ‘but I’m not going to sit here on my own sobbing into my Cup<br />
a Soup. I want a celebration.’</p>
<p>The preparations had taken her mind off things. She’d had to embrace the royal<br />
wedding totally, in order to forget that this was supposed to be her day, too. She’d<br />
ordered bunting, and Union Jack napkins, and glittery crowns for them all to wear.<br />
Decorated her tiny little garden flat with red, white and blue. And tried not to think<br />
about the all the things she had ordered for her own wedding, all the things that had<br />
been sent back, cancelled, returned.</p>
<p>The planning had taken months. When Sally and Richard booked the date, they<br />
hadn’t known that William and Kate were going to choose the same day and they’d<br />
giggled with glee when they found out. What a stroke of luck that their wedding day<br />

It&#8217;s question  15 that has the Maine schoolteacher stumped: Is their relationship  strong enough to withstand challenges?</em></p>
<p><em>Challenges like…Ruby&#8217;s twin  sister, Stella. The professional muse, flirt and face reader thinks Ruby  is playing it safe. And that the future Mrs. Ruby Truby will die of  boredom before her first anniversary or her thirtieth birthday,  whichever comes first.</em></p>
<p><em>Challenges like…sexy maverick teacher Nick  McDermott, Ruby&#8217;s secret longtime crush, who confesses his feelings for  her at her own engagement party.</em></p>
<p><em>But before Ruby can plan the  wedding that may never be, Stella announces she&#8217;s pregnant by a  one-night stand whose name might be Jake (or James? Maybe Jason?) and  who lives somewhere under the glittering lights of Las Vegas. Ruby and  Stella hit the road to find him—with a lot more than fifteen questions.</em></p>
<p><em>And  after three thousand miles, a stowaway relative and hitchhiking teen  lovebirds bound for an Elvis wedding chapel, the Miller sisters might  get some answers.</em></p>
