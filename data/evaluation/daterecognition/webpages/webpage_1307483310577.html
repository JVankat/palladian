				<p>After the 1920s, Stalin's dictatorship was linked to a

				Stalin's policies were declared socialist dogma, and in 1936 the 
				hegemony of the Communist party at all levels of society and 
				state was officially established. The state secret police kept 
				the population under surveillance and eliminated any opposition 
				with <font color="#af1f0f"><b>11</b></font> shootings, forced 
				labor, and deportations to Siberia.<br>
				<br>
				Without regard for human life, forced farm collectivization was 
				introduced in 1928; the farms were to be combined into great 
				production cooperatives. <br>
				<br>
				The farmers who owned medium and large tracts were defamed as 
				&quot;enemies of the people&quot; and &quot;exploiters&quot;; their land was 
				expropriated, and they were sent off to <b>
				<font color="#af1f0f">8</font></b> work camps in Siberia.<br>
				<br>
				A temporary, massive collapse of agriculture was the result; in 
				the Ukraine four million people <font color="#af1f0f"><b>9</b></font>

				Political repression in the Soviet Union<br>
				</font><br>
				<i><b>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>
				</b></i><br>
				<br>
				Throughout the Soviet history millions of people became victims 
				of Soviet political repression, which was an instrument of the 
				internal politics of the Soviet Russia and Soviet Union since 
				the first days after the October Revolution. Culminating during 
				the Stalin era, it still existed during the &quot;Khrushchev Thaw,&quot; 
				followed by increased persecution of Soviet dissidents during 
				Brezhnev stagnation, and didn't cease to exist during 
				Gorbachev's perestroika. Its heritage still influences the life 
				of the modern Russia. <br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Origins and early Soviet times<br>
				</font><br>
				Early on the theoretical basis of the repressions was the 
				Marxist view at the class struggle and the resulting notion of 
				the dictatorship of the proletariat. Its legal basis was 
				formalized into the Article 58 in the code of RSFSR and similar 
				articles for other Soviet republics. </p>
				<p>The terms &quot;repression&quot;, &quot;terror&quot;, and other strong words were 
				normal working terms with respect to the internal politics of 
				the early Soviet state,[citation needed] reflecting the fact 
				that the dictatorship of the proletariat was supposed apply 
				ruthless force to suppress the resistance of the social classes 
				which Marxism considered antagonistic to the class of 
				proletariat. This phraseology was gradually abolished after 
				destalinization, but the system of persecution for political 
				views and activities remained until the dissolution of the 
				Soviet Union.</p>
				<p>At times, the repressed were called the enemies of the 
				people. Punishments by the state included summary executions, 
				sending innocent people to Gulag, forced resettlement, and 
				stripping of citizen's rights. At certain times, all members of 
				a family, including children, were punished as &quot;traitor of 
				Motherland family members&quot;. Repression was conducted by the 
				Cheka and its successors, and other state organs. Periods of the 
				increased repression include Red Terror, Collectivisation, the 
				Great Purges, the Doctor's Plot, and others. The secret police 
				forces conducted massacres of prisoners on numerous occasions. 
				Repression was practiced in the Soviet republics and in the 
				territories liberated by Soviet Army during World War II, 
				including Baltic States and Eastern Europe.</p>
				<p>State repression led to resistance, which were brutally 
				suppressed by military force, such as the Tambov rebellion, 
				Kronstadt rebellion, and Vorkuta Uprising. During the Tambov 
				rebellion, Bolshevik military forces used chemical weapons 
				against villages with civilian population and rebels. Prominent 
				citizens of villages were often taken as hostages and executed 
				if the resistance fighters did not surrender.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Red Terror<br>
				<br>
				</font>Red Terror in Soviet Russia was the campaign of mass 
				arrests and executions conducted by the Bolshevik government. 
				The Red Terror was officially announced on September 2, 1918 by 
				Yakov Sverdlov and ended in about October 1918. However Sergei 
				Melgunov applies this term to repressions for the whole period 
				of the Russian Civil War, 1918-1922.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Collectivization<br>
				</font><br>
				Collectivization in the Soviet Union was a policy, pursued 
				between 1928 and 1933, to consolidate individual land and labour 
				into collective farms (Russian: &#1082;&#1086;&#1083;&#1093;&#1086;&#769;&#1079;, kolkhoz, plural 
				kolkhozy). The Soviet leaders were confident that the 
				replacement of individual peasant farms by kolkhozy would 
				immediately increase food supplies for the urban population, the 
				supply of raw materials for processing industry, and 
				agricultural exports generally. Collectivization was thus 
				regarded as the solution to the crisis in agricultural 
				distribution (mainly in grain deliveries) that had developed 
				since 1927 and was becoming more acute as the Soviet Union 
				pressed ahead with its ambitious industrialization program. As 
				peasantry, with exception of the poorest part, resisted the 
				collectivization policy, the Soviet government resorted to the 
				harsh measures to force the farmers to collectivize. In his 
				conversation with Winston Churchill Stalin gave his estimate of 
				the number of &quot;kulaks&quot; who were repressed for resisting 
				collectivization as 10 million, including those forcibly 
				deported.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Great Terror<br>
				</font><br>
				The Great Purge (Russian: &#1041;&#1086;&#1083;&#1100;&#1096;&#1072;&#1103; &#1095;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1082;&#1072;, transliterated 
				Bolshaya chistka) was a series of campaigns of political 
				repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated by 
				Joseph Stalin in 1937-1938. It involved the purge of the 
				Communist Party of the Soviet Union, repression of peasants, 
				deportations of ethnic minorities, and the persecution of 
				unaffiliated persons, characterized by widespread police 
				surveillance, widespread suspicion of &quot;saboteurs&quot;, imprisonment, 
				and killings. Estimates of the number of deaths associated with 
				the Great Purge run from the official figure of 681,692 to 
				nearly 2 million.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Genocide, ethnic cleansing, and population 
				transfers<br>
				</font><br>
				In Soviet Union, political repressions targeted not only 
				individual persons, but also whole ethnic, social, religious, 
				and other categories of population. </p>
				<p>Population transfer in the Soviet Union may be classified 
				into the following broad categories: deportations of 
				&quot;anti-Soviet&quot; categories of population, often classified as 
				&quot;enemies of workers&quot;, deportations of nationalities, labor force 
				transfer, and organized migrations in opposite directions to 
				fill the ethnically cleansed territories.</p>
				<p>Entire nations and ethnic groups have been collectively 
				punished by the Soviet Government for alleged collaboration with 
				the enemy during World War II. At least nine of distinct 
				ethnic-linguistic groups, including ethnic Germans, ethnic 
				Greeks, ethnic Poles, Crimean Tatars, Balkars, Chechens, and 
				Kalmyks, were deported to remote unpopulated areas of Siberia 
				and Kazakhstan. Population transfer in the Soviet Union led to 
				millions of deaths due to the inflicted hardships. Koreans and 
				Romanians were also deported. Mass operations of the NKVD were 
				needed to deport hundreds of thousands of people. </p>
				<p>The Soviet famine of 1932-1933 was severely aggravated by the 
				actions of the government of the Soviet Union, such as the 
				confiscation of food, the lack of meat, planned delivery 
				limitations that ignored the famine, blocking the migration of 
				its starving population, and the suppression of the information 
				about the famine, all of which prevented any organized relief 
				effort. This had led to deaths of millions of people in the 
				affected area. The overall number of the 1932-1933 famine 
				victims Soviet-wide is estimated as 6-7 million or 6-8 million.<br>

				Gulag: A History, by Anne Applebaum, explains: &quot;It was the 
				branch of the State Security that operated the penal system of 
				forced labour camps and associated detention and transit camps 
				and prisons. While these camps housed criminals of all types, 
				the Gulag system has become primarily known as a place for 
				political prisoners and as a mechanism for repressing political 
				opposition to the Soviet state.�<br>

				</font>After Stalin's death, the suppression of dissent was 
				dramatically reduced and took new forms. The internal critics of 
				the system were convicted for anti-Soviet agitation, Anti-Soviet 
				slander, or as &quot;social parasites&quot;. Others were labeled as 
				mentally ill, having sluggishly progressing schizophrenia and 
				incarcerated in &quot;psikhushkas&quot;, i.e. mental hospitals used by the 
				Soviet authorities as prisons. A number of notable dissidents, 
				including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Bukovsky, and Andrei 
				Sakharov, were sent to internal or external exile.<br>

				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Pre-KGB Soviet security services<br>
				</font>Established in 1954, the KGB was the most durable of a 
				series of security agencies starting with the <b>Cheka</b>, 
				which was established in December 1917 in the first days of the 
				Bolshevik government. The Cheka (originally VCHEKA, an acronym 
				derived from the Russian words for All-Russian Extraordinary 
				Commission for Combating Counterrevolution and Sabotage) was 
				charged with the preliminary investigation of counterrevolution 
				and sabotage, but it quickly assumed responsibility for 
				arresting, imprisoning, and executing �enemies of the state,� 
				which included the former nobility, the bourgeoisie, and the 
				clergy. The Cheka played a prominent role in the Russian Civil 
				War (1918�20) and aided in crushing the anti-Soviet Kronshtadt 
				and Antonov rebellions in 1921. When Soviet archives were opened 
				in the 1990s, it was learned that the Cheka, which in 1921 had a 
				staff of more than 250,000, was responsible for the execution of 
				more than 140,000 people. <b>Feliks Dzerzhinsky</b>, the Cheka�s 
				chief during the early years of Soviet power, molded the service 
				into an effective, merciless tool of the ruling Communist Party.
				</p>
				<p>In 1922 the Cheka was supplanted by the <b>GPU</b> (State 
				Political Administration) in an effort by the Communist Party to 
				reduce the scale of the Cheka�s terror. A year later the GPU was 
				renamed the <b>OGPU</b> (Unified State Political Administration) 
				and given additional duties, including the administration of 
				�corrective� labour camps and the surveillance of the 
				population. As Joseph Stalin consolidated his power and directed 
				the modernization of the Soviet Union, the OGPU implemented the 
				forced collectivization of agriculture and the deportation of 
				the kulaks (wealthy peasants) and staged show trials of �enemies 
				of the people.� By the early 1930s the OGPU controlled all 
				Soviet security functions, directing a vast army of informers in 
				factories, government offices, and the Red Army. During this 
				period the OGPU also conducted covert operations on foreign soil 
				to disrupt the activities of the regime�s opponents, some of 
				whom it kidnapped and murdered. </p>
				<p>In 1934 the OGPU was absorbed into the new <b>NKVD</b> 
				(People�s Commissariat of Internal Affairs), which helped Stalin 
				to consolidate his power by carrying out purges (see purge 
				trials). More than 750,000 people were executed in 1937�38 
				alone, including tens of thousands of party officials and 
				military and security officers. Among the victims were more than 
				half the members of the ruling Central Committee (the Communist 
				Party�s highest organ) as well as the NKVD�s first two chiefs,
				<b>Genrikh Yagoda</b> and <b>Nikolay Yezhov</b>. Yezhov was 
				succeeded as head of the NKVD by<b> Lavrenty Beria</b>, who 
				served from 1938 to 1953. <br>

							<br>

							<br>
							Son of a Polish nobleman, Dzerzhinsky joined the 
							Kaunas (Kovno) organization of the Lithuanian Social 
							Democratic Party in 1895. He became a party 
							organizer, and, although he was arrested by the 
							Russian Imperial Police for his revolutionary 
							activities five times between 1897 and 1908, he 
							repeatedly escaped from exile in Siberia. Not only 
							did he participate in the Russian Revolution of 1905 
							but he also became a leader of the Polish-Lithuanian 
							Social Democratic Party and was influential in 
							convincing his colleagues to unite with the Russian 
							Social Democrats in 1906. Afterward, Dzerzhinsky 
							pursued his revolutionary activities within the 
							Russian Empire and in western Europe. Arrested for 
							the sixth time in 1912, he remained in captivity 
							until after the February Revolution of 1917. </p>
							<p>Dzerzhinsky was elected to the Bolshevik Party�s 
							Central Committee in July 1917, and he played an 
							active role in the October Revolution (1917). On 
							Dec. 20 (Dec. 7), 1917, he was named head of the new 
							All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating 
							Counterrevolution and Sabotage (Cheka), which became 
							Soviet Russia�s security police agency. The Cheka 
							helped stabilize V.I. Lenin�s dictatorship by 
							arbitrarily executing real and alleged enemies of 
							the Soviet state. Dzerzhinsky, who organized the 
							first concentration camps in Russia, acquired a 
							reputation as an incorruptible, ruthless, and 
							fanatical communist. </p>
							<p>During the Russo-Polish War (1919�20), 
							Dzerzhinsky was appointed to the Polish 
							revolutionary committee that was intended to become 
							the Bolshevik government of Poland. But after the 
							Soviet army was forced to retreat from Poland, he 
							again concentrated on Russian affairs. He remained 
							head of the Cheka and commissar for internal affairs 
							(after 1919) and became commissar for transport 
							(1921). In 1924, after he had become a firm 
							supporter of Joseph Stalin, Dzerzhinsky was given 
							control of the Supreme Economic Council and was also 
							elected a candidate of the Politburo. In 1926, 
							during a debate at a Central Committee session, 
							Dzerzhinsky collapsed and died. </p>

							<br>
							Nothing is known of his early life (he was nicknamed 
							the �Dwarf� because he was but five feet tall and

							was a political commissar in the Red Army during the

							a member of a newly established central Purge 
							Commission, which conducted a bloodless purge that

							<p>Meanwhile, on Sept. 26, 1936, he had succeeded

							Great Purge (1936�38). Beria was brought to Moscow 
							in 1938 as the deputy to Nikolay Yezhov, head of the

							the Soviet secret police. Yezhov was apparently 
							arrested and shot on Stalin�s orders, and Beria

							being an �imperialist agent� and of conducting

				<p>In 1941 responsibility for state security was transferred 
				from the <b>NKVD</b> to the<b> NKGB</b> (People�s Commissariat 
				for State Security). Both agencies became ministries�the 
				Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the Ministry of State 
				Security (MGB)�in 1946. Beria, as a member of the ruling Central 
				Committee, continued to supervise the two ministries while 
				serving as head of the MVD. Beria also was responsible for the 
				Soviet Union�s nascent nuclear weapons program and oversaw 
				intelligence operations directed at the U.S. and British atomic 
				bomb projects. </p>
				<p>The MGB, directed by V.S. Abakumov under Beria�s supervision, 
				played a major role in the Soviet Union�s war effort in World 
				War II and in the subsequent consolidation of its power in 
				eastern Europe. During the war, the MGB conducted espionage and 
				counterespionage operations, administered prisoner-of-war camps, 
				and ensured the loyalty of the officer corps. It also supervised 
				the deportation to Siberia and Central Asia of groups suspected 
				of disloyalty, including more than one million Volga Germans, 
				Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks, Chechen-Ingush, and other people of the 
				Caucasus. </p>
				<p>After the war, the MGB helped to crush all opposition, 
				whether real or suspected, in eastern Europe and the Soviet 
				Union; between 1945 and 1953 more than 750,000 Soviet citizens 
				were arrested and punished for political crimes. Information 
				uncovered in the 1990s indicated that by 1953 some 2,750,00 
				Soviet citizens were in jail or in forced-labour camps, and 
				approximately the same number were in internal exile. </p>
				<p>Soviet foreign intelligence in the last decade of Stalin�s 
				life was remarkable in both its scope and success. During World 
				War II the MGB conducted operations in Nazi-occupied Europe. One 
				of its networks, the �Red Orchestra,� comprised several hundred 
				agents and informers, including agents in the German ministries 
				of foreign affairs, labour, propaganda, and economics. 
				Declassified Russian and American documents indicate that the 
				Soviet Union had placed at least five agents in the U.S. nuclear 
				weapons program and possibly as many as 300 agents in the U.S. 
				government by 1945. The British diplomatic and security 
				establishments also had been infiltrated by important agents, 
				including Kim Philby, a senior British intelligence officer. 
				Evidence suggests that Soviet agents in Britain passed 15,000 to 
				20,000 documents to Moscow between 1941 and 1945. British and 
				American agents of Soviet intelligence were for the most part 
				ideological supporters of the regime, and many were members of 
				communist parties. </p>
				<p>Immediately following Stalin�s death in March 1953, the MGB 
				was merged back into the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), 
				still under Beria. Before the end of summer, the post-Stalinist 
				leadership under Nikita Khrushchev turned against the 
				power-hungry Beria, and he was deposed and executed. A series of 
				trials and executions continuing into 1956 eliminated a number 
				of his senior associates. In the meantime, millions of political 
				prisoners were released from the MVD�s vast system of forced 
				labour camps and from internal exile. The MVD was gradually 
				dismantled and finally abolished in 1960. <br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Creation and role of the KGB</font><br>
				The KGB was created in 1954 to serve as the �sword and shield of 
				the Communist Party.� The new security service, which played a 
				major role in the purge of Beria�s supporters, was designed to 
				be carefully controlled by senior Communist Party officials. It 
				was divided into approximately 20 directorates, the most 
				important of which were those responsible for foreign 
				intelligence, domestic counterintelligence, technical 
				intelligence, protection of the political leadership, and the 
				security of the country�s frontiers. In the late 1960s an 
				additional directorate was created to conduct surveillance on 
				suspected dissidents in the churches and among the 
				intelligentsia. For the next 20 years the KGB became 
				increasingly zealous in its pursuit of enemies, harassing, 
				arresting, and sometimes exiling human rights advocates, 
				Christian and Jewish activists, and intellectuals judged to be 
				disloyal to the regime. Among the most famous of its victims 
				were the Nobel laureates Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrey 
				Sakharov. </p>
				<p>After World War II the KGB gradually expanded its foreign 
				intelligence operations to become the world�s largest foreign 
				intelligence service. As the Cold War with the United States 
				intensified, the KGB came to be viewed as a counterpart of the 
				U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; however, unlike the CIA, the 
				KGB conducted most of its activities domestically, on Soviet 
				soil and against Soviet citizens. The KGB�s many agents 
				sometimes posed as businessmen and journalists, though many used 
				the more conventional diplomatic cover. Its successes included 
				the infiltration of every major Western intelligence operation 
				and the placement of agents of influence in almost every major 
				capital. The KGB also was able to procure scientific and 
				technical information for the Soviet military, and it repeatedly 
				obtained advanced technology necessary for the development of 
				Soviet submarines, airplanes, and rockets. Along with the GRU 
				(Chief Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff), which was 
				responsible for purely military operations, the KGB enjoyed 
				tremendous access to the secrets of both its adversaries and its 
				allies. </p>
				<p>By the end of the 1960s, the<b> KGB</b> had become firmly 
				established as the Communist Party�s security watchdog. Its 
				value as an instrument of political control was reflected in the 
				appointment of its head, <b>Yury Andropov</b>, to the Politburo 
				(1973) and his succession to the head of the party and the 
				country in 1982. Under Andropov, the KGB recruited the �best and 
				the brightest� members from the party establishment. Although it 
				was aware of the extent of corruption in the decaying Soviet 
				Union and did investigate and arrest some minor figures, it 
				continued to be a servant of the party and was thus powerless to 
				halt the country�s decline. </p>
				<p>The KGB did not fare as well under the reformist Soviet 
				leader Mikhail Gorbachev (1985�91). Although Gorbachev respected 
				the KGB�s prowess in foreign intelligence, his reform agenda 
				undercut its authority as well as that of the Communist Party. 
				In the summer of 1991, several senior KGB officers, including 
				KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, played key roles in an abortive 
				coup designed to return the Soviet system to ideological and 
				bureaucratic purity. Afterward the KGB was systematically 
				stripped of its extensive military units and many of its 
				domestic security functions. </p>
				<p>With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the KGB 
				came under the control of Russia. The government of Russian 
				President Boris Yeltsin supervised the division of the KGB into 
				several major services responsible for internal security and 
				foreign intelligence. Ukraine, Belarus, and other former Soviet 
				republics established their own intelligence and security 
				services, which maintained links to those of Russia. 
				Nevertheless, efforts in Russia to reform the intelligence 
				services were at best incomplete. The KGB and its leaders were 
				never held accountable for crimes against the Soviet people. <br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Assessment<br>
				</b>At its peak the KGB was the largest secret-police and 
				foreign-intelligence organization in the world. Researchers with 
				access to Communist Party archives put the number of KGB 
				personnel at more than 480,000, including 200,000 soldiers in 
				the Border Guards. Estimates of the number of informers in the 
				Soviet Union are incomplete but usually range in the millions. 
				Every Soviet leader depended on the KGB and its predecessors for 
				information, surveillance of key elites, and control of the 
				population. With the Communist Party and the army, the KGB 
				formed the triad of power that ruled the Soviet Union. The KGB 
				played a particularly important role in Soviet foreign policy. 
				Foreign intelligence allowed the Soviet Union to maintain rough 
				parity with the West in nuclear weapons and other weapons 
				systems. Inside the country, however, the role of the KGB was 
				baleful. Scholars disagree about the human cost of the KGB and 
				its predecessors, but many estimate that they were responsible 
				for the deaths of tens of millions of people. </p>
				<p>A critical question in evaluating the KGB�s foreign and 
				domestic operations is why it failed to prevent the eventual 
				collapse of the Soviet system. There is ample evidence that the 
				KGB suffered from the same problems of bureaucratic inefficiency 
				and corruption that plagued the sclerotic political leadership. 
				In addition, during the last decade of Soviet power, numerous 
				KGB officials defected to the West or agreed to work as agents 
				in place in Moscow. Moreover, some studies suggest that, despite 
				its vaunted reputation for espionage, the KGB lacked the 
				analytical skills necessary to form an accurate picture of the 
				regime�s declining international and domestic situation. See 
				also Federal Security Service. </p>

				Great Purge<br>
				</font><br>
				<b><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>
				</i></b><br>
				Great Purge was a series of campaigns of political repression 
				and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated by Joseph 
				Stalin in 1937�1938.[1][2] It involved a large-scale purge of 
				the Communist Party and Government officials, repression of 
				peasants, Red Army leadership, and the persecution of 
				unaffiliated persons, characterized by widespread police 
				surveillance, widespread suspicion of &quot;saboteurs&quot;, imprisonment, 
				and executions. According to the archive data, in 1937�38 the 
				number of death sentences was 681,692 and many more died in 
				GULAG labor camps. </p>
				<p>In Russian historiography the period of the most intense 
				purge, 1937�1938, is called Yezhovshchina (Russian: &#1045;&#1078;&#1086;&#769;&#1074;&#1097;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;; 
				literally, the Yezhov regime), after Nikolai Yezhov, the then 
				head of the Soviet secret police, NKVD. </p>
				<p>In the Western World the term &quot;the Great Terror&quot; was 
				popularized by the title of Robert Conquest's book. The book, 
				The Great Terror, was in turn inspired by the period of the 
				Great Terror (French: la Grande Terreur) at the end of the Reign 
				of Terror during the French Revolution. </p>

				</font><br>
				</b>The term &quot;repression&quot; was officially used to denote the 
				prosecution of people considered as anti-revolutionaries and 
				enemies of the people. The purge was motivated by the desire on 
				the part of the leadership to remove dissident elements from the 
				Party and what is often considered to have been a desire to 
				consolidate the authority of Joseph Stalin. Additional campaigns 
				of repression were carried out against social groups which were 
				accused of acting against the Soviet state and the politics of 
				the Communist Party. </p>
				<p>A number of purges were officially explained as an 
				elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, in 
				view of an expected war with Germany. Most public attention was 
				focused on the purge of the leadership of the Communist Party 
				itself, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the 
				armed forces, the vast majority being Party members. However, 
				the campaigns affected many other categories of the society: 
				intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as &quot;too 
				rich for a peasant&quot; (kulaks), and professionals. A series of 
				NKVD (the Soviet secret police) operations affected a number of 
				national minorities, accused of being &quot;fifth column&quot; 
				communities. </p>
				<p>According to Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 speech, &quot;On the 
				Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot;, and more recent 
				findings, a great number of accusations, notably those presented 
				at the Moscow show trials, were based on forced confessions, 
				often obtained by torture, and on loose interpretations of 
				Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code, which dealt with 
				counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by 
				Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with 
				summary proceedings by NKVD troikas.</p>
				<p>Hundreds of thousands of victims were falsely accused of 
				various political crimes (espionage, wrecking, sabotage, 
				anti-Soviet agitation, conspiracies to prepare uprisings and 
				coups) and then executed by shooting, or sent to the Gulag labor 
				camps. Many died at the penal labor camps due to starvation, 
				disease, exposure and overwork. Other methods of dispatching 
				victims were used on an experimental basis. For example, one 
				secret policeman gassed people to death in batches in the back 
				of a specially adapted airtight van.</p>
				<p>The Great Purge was started under the NKVD chief <b>Genrikh 
				Yagoda</b>, but the height of the campaigns occurred while the 
				NKVD was headed by <b>Nikolai Yezhov</b>, from September 1936 to 
				August 1938, hence the name &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot;. However the 
				campaigns were carried out according to the general line, and 
				often by direct orders, of the Party Politburo headed by Stalin.<br>

				</b><br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Background<br>
				</font>The term &quot;purge&quot; in Soviet political slang was an 
				abbreviation of the expression purge of the Party ranks. In 
				1933, for example, some 400,000 people were expelled from the 
				Party. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, 
				because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost 
				certain arrest, imprisonment, or even execution. </p>
				<p>The political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to 
				eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, 
				including left and right wings led by Leon Trotsky and Nikolai 
				Bukharin, respectively. Following the Civil War and 
				reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, the 
				&quot;temporary&quot; wartime dictatorship which had passed from Lenin to 
				Stalin seemed no longer necessary to veteran Communists. 
				Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum 
				chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. 
				These tendencies may have accumulated substantial support among 
				the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the 
				state offered to its high-paid elite. The Ryutin Affair seemed 
				to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He therefore enforced a ban on 
				party factions and banned those party members who had opposed 
				him, effectively ending democratic centralism. In the new form 
				of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, 
				were the sole dispensers of communist ideology. This 
				necessitated the elimination of all Marxists with different 
				views, especially those among the prestigious &quot;old guard&quot; of 
				revolutionaries. Communist heroes like Tukhachevsky and B�la 
				Kun, as well as Lenin's entire politburo, were shot for minor 
				disagreements in policy. The NKVD were equally merciless towards 
				the supporters, friends, and family of these heretical Marxists, 
				whether they lived in Russia or not. The most infamous case is 
				that of Leon Trotsky, whose family was almost annihilated, 
				before he himself was killed in Mexico by NKVD agent Ram�n 
				Mercader, who was part of an assassination task force put 
				together by Special Agent Pavel Sudoplatov, under the personal 
				orders of Joseph Stalin.</p>
				<p>
				<img height="400" src="images2/415/purge9.jpg" width="313" border="1"><br>
				<b>Stalin and Kirov<br>
				</b><br>
				Sergey Kirov's murder in 1934 may be called the crime of century 
				as it was used by Stalin as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, 
				in which about a million people perished. Some later historians 
				came to believe that Stalin himself arranged the murder, or at 
				least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a 
				conclusion. Kirov himself was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but 
				Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his 
				emerging popularity among the moderates. In the 1934 party 
				congress, Kirov was elected to the central committee with only 
				three negative votes, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin 
				received 292 negative votes. After Kirov's assassination, Stalin 
				NKVD charged the ever growing group of former oppositionists 
				with Kirov's murder and a growing list of other charges 
				including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage. </p>
				<p>Another official justification was to remove any possible 
				&quot;fifth column&quot; in case of a war, but this is less substantiated 
				by independent sources. This is the theory proposed by 
				Vyacheslav Molotov, a member of the Stalinist ruling circle, who 
				participated in the Stalinist repression as a member of the 
				Politburo and who signed many death warrants. Stalin's vehemence 
				in eliminating political opponents may have had some basis in, 
				and was definitely given official justification by, the need to 
				solidify Russia against her neighbors, most notably Germany and 
				Japan, whose governments had previously invaded, and now openly 
				threatened, Soviet territory. A famous quote of Stalin's is &quot;We 
				are 50 or 100 years behind the advanced countries. We must make 
				good this lag in 10 years. Either we do it, or they crush us.&quot; 
				The Communist Party also wanted to eliminate what it perceived 
				as &quot;socially dangerous elements&quot;, such as ex-kulaks, 
				ex-&quot;nepmen&quot;, former members of opposing political parties such 
				as the Social Revolutionaries, and former Tsarist officials. </p>
				<p>Repression against perceived enemies of the Bolsheviks had 
				been a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating 
				social control, being continuously applied by Lenin since the 
				October Revolution, although there had been periods of 
				heightened repression, such as the Red Terror, the deportation 
				of kulaks who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine. A 
				distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first 
				time, the ruling party itself underwent repressions on a massive 
				scale. Nevertheless, only a minority of those affected by the 
				purges were Communist Party members and office-holders. The 
				purge of the Party was accompanied by the purge of the whole 
				society. The following events are used for the demarcation of 
				the period. <br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Moscow Trials <br>
				<br>
				<img height="192" src="images2/415/purge11.jpg" width="910" border="1"></font></p>
				<p><b>First and Second Moscow Trials</b></p>
				<p>Between 1936 and 1938, three very large Moscow Trials of 
				former senior Communist Party leaders were held, in which they 
				were accused of conspiring with fascist and capitalist powers to 
				assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the 
				Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly 
				publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which 
				was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates 
				confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death 
				sentences. </p>
				<p>The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called 
				&quot;Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary 
				Bloc&quot;, held in August 1936, at which the chief defendants were 
				Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, two of the most prominent 
				former party leaders. Among other accusations, they were 
				incriminated with the assassination of Sergey Kirov and plotting 
				to kill Stalin. After confessing to the charges, all were 
				sentenced to death and executed. <br>
				The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures 
				known as the &quot;anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre&quot; which included Karl 
				Radek, Yuri Piatakov and Grigory Sokolnikov, and were accused of 
				plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Nazi 
				Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually shot. The 
				rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died. <br>
				There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a 
				group of Red Army generals, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in 
				June 1937. <br>
				Some Western observers who attended the trials said that they 
				were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been 
				established. They based this assessment on the confessions of 
				the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any 
				apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or 
				drugging. Others, like Fitzroy Maclean were a little more astute 
				in their observations and conclusions. </p>
				<p>The British lawyer and Member of Parliament D. N. Pritt, for 
				example, wrote: &quot;Once again the more faint-hearted socialists 
				are beset with doubts and anxieties&quot;, but &quot;once again we can 
				feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the 
				battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge 
				was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly 
				conducted&quot;. </p>
				<p>It is now known that the confessions were given only after 
				great psychological pressure had been applied to the defendants. 
				From the accounts of former OGPU officer Alexander Orlov and 
				others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: 
				such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making 
				prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats 
				to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, 
				Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. 
				After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven 
				to despair and exhaustion. </p>
				<p>Zinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for 
				&quot;confessing&quot;, a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their 
				lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. 
				This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged 
				Politburo meeting, only Stalin, Kliment Voroshilov, and Yezhov 
				were present. Stalin claimed that they were the &quot;commission&quot; 
				authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death 
				sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not 
				only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of 
				their relatives arrested and shot.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Dewey Commission<br>
				</b>In May 1937, the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made 
				against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, commonly known as the 
				Dewey Commission, was set up in the United States by supporters 
				of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The 
				commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and 
				educator John Dewey. Although the hearings were obviously 
				conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they 
				brought to light evidence which established that some of the 
				specific charges made at the trials could not be true. </p>
				<p>For example, Georgy Pyatakov testified that he had flown to 
				Oslo in December 1935 to &quot;receive terrorist instructions&quot; from 
				Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight 
				had taken place. Another defendant, Ivan Smirnov, confessed to 
				taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 
				1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.
				</p>
				<p>The Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 
				422-page book titled Not Guilty. Its conclusions asserted the 
				innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its 
				summary, the commission wrote: &quot;Independent of extrinsic 
				evidence, the Commission finds: </p>
				<p>That the conduct of the Moscow Trials was such as to convince 
				any unprejudiced person that no attempt was made to ascertain 
				the truth. <br>
				That while confessions are necessarily entitled to the most 
				serious consideration, the confessions themselves contain such 
				inherent improbabilities as to convince the Commission that they 
				do not represent the truth, irrespective of any means used to 
				obtain them. <br>
				That Trotsky never instructed any of the accused or witnesses in 
				the Moscow trials to enter into agreements with foreign powers 
				against the Soviet Union [and] that Trotsky never recommended, 
				plotted, or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the USSR.
				<br>
				The commission concluded: &quot;We therefore find the Moscow Trials 
				to be frame-ups.&quot;<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Implication of the Rightists<br>
				</b>In the second trial, Karl Radek provided (or more accurately 
				was forced to provide) the pretext for greater purge to come on 
				a massive scale with his testimony that there were &quot;third 
				organization separate from the cadres which had passed through 
				[Trotsky's] school&quot; as well as &quot;semi-Trotskyites, 
				quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped 
				us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing 
				with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the 
				Party, gave us this help.&quot; </p>
				<p>By the &quot;third organization&quot;, he meant the last remaining 
				former opposition group called Rightists led by Bukharin, whom 
				he implicated by saying: &quot;I feel guilty of one thing more: even 
				after admitting my guilt and exposing the organisation, I 
				stubbornly refused to give evidence about Bukharin. I knew that 
				Bukharin's situation was just as hopeless as my own, because our 
				guilt, if not juridically, then in essence, was the same. But we 
				are close friends, and intellectual friendship is stronger than 
				other friendships. I knew that Bukharin was in the same state of 
				upheaval as myself. That is why I did not want to deliver him 
				bound hand and foot to the People's Commissariat of Home 
				Affairs. Just as in relation to our other cadres, I wanted 
				Bukharin himself to lay down his arms.&quot; <br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Third Moscow Trial<br>
				</b>The third and final trial, in March 1938, known as The Trial 
				of the Twenty-One, is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, 
				because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied 
				together all loose threads from earlier trials. It included 21 
				defendants alleged to belong to the so-called &quot;Bloc of Rightists 
				and Trotskyites&quot;, led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman 
				of the Communist International, ex-premier Alexei Rykov , 
				Christian Rakovsky, Nikolai Krestinsky and Genrikh Yagoda, 
				recently disgraced head of the NKVD. </p>
				<p>The fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed 
				at which the purges were consuming its own. Meant to be the 
				culmination of previous trials, it was now alleged that Bukharin 
				and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, 
				murder Maxim Gorky by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand out 
				her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other 
				preposterous charges. </p>
				<p>Even previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the 
				earlier trials found it harder to swallow new allegations as 
				they became ever more absurd, and the purge now expanded to 
				include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. 
				No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western 
				intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a 
				Marxist theorist of international standing. For some prominent 
				communists such as Bertram Wolfe, Jay Lovestone, Arthur 
				Koestler, and Heinrich Brandler, the Bukharin trial marked their 
				final break with communism, and even turned the first three into 
				fervent anti-Communists eventually. To them, Bukharin�s 
				confession symbolized the depredations of communism, which not 
				only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in 
				self-destruction and individual abnegation.</p>
				<p>The preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was 
				delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party 
				members in denouncing their comrades. It was at this time that 
				Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and 
				replaced Yagoda with Nikolai Yezhov. Stalin also observed some 
				of the trial in person from a hidden chamber in the courtroom.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Bukharin's Confession</b><br>
				On the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he 
				repudiated his written confession and pled not guilty to all the 
				charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after 
				&quot;special measures&quot;, which dislocated his left shoulder among 
				other things.</p>
				<p>Anastas Mikoyan and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that 
				Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his 
				interrogators were given the order, &quot;beating permitted,&quot; and 
				were under great pressure to extract confession out of the 
				&quot;star&quot; defendant. Bukharin held out for three months, but 
				threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with &quot;methods 
				of physical influence&quot; wore him down. But when he read his 
				confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he 
				withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over 
				again, with a double team of interrogators.</p>
				<p>Bukharin's confession in particular became subject of much 
				debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed 
				novel Darkness at Noon and philosophical essay by Maurice 
				Merleau-Ponty in Humanism and Terror. His confessions were 
				somewhat different from others in that while he pled guilty to 
				&quot;sum total of crimes&quot;, he denied knowledge when it came to 
				specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow 
				only what was in written confession and refuse to go any 
				further. Also the fact that he was allowed to write in prison 
				(he wrote four book-length manuscripts including a 
				autobiographical novel, How It All Began, philosophical 
				treatise, and collection of poems - all of which were found in 
				Stalin's archive and published in 1990's) suggests that some 
				kind of deal was reached as a condition for confession. (He also 
				wrote a series of very emotional letters to Stalin tearfully 
				protesting his innocence and professing his love for Stalin, 
				which contrasts with his critical opinion of Stalin and his 
				policies expressed to others and his conduct in the trial.) </p>
				<p>There are several interpretations of Bukharin's motivations 
				(besides being coerced) in the trial. Koestler and others viewed 
				it as a true believer's last service to the Party (while 
				preserving little amount of personal honor left) whereas 
				Bukharin biographer Stephen Cohen and Robert Tucker saw traces 
				of Aesopian language, with which Bukharin sought to turn the 
				table into an anti-trial of Stalinism (while keeping his part of 
				bargain to save his family). Bukharin himself speaks of his 
				&quot;peculiar duality of mind&quot; in his last plea, which led to 
				&quot;semi-paralysis of the will&quot; and Hegelian &quot;unhappy 
				consciousness&quot;, which presumably stemmed from the reality of 
				ruinous Stalinism (although he could not of course say so in the 
				trial) and the impending threat of fascism (which required 
				kowtowing to Stalin, who became the personification of the 
				Party). </p>
				<p>The result was a curious mix of fullsome confessions (of 
				being a &quot;degenerate fascist&quot; working for &quot;restoration of 
				capitalism&quot;) and subtle criticisms of the trial. After 
				disproving several charges against him (One observer noted that 
				he &quot;proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily 
				demolish the whole case.&quot;) and saying that &quot;the confession of 
				accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a 
				medieval principle of jurisprudence&quot; in a trial that was solely 
				based on confessions, he finished his last plea with the words: 
				&quot;the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the 
				new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last 
				severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R become 
				clear to all.&quot; </p>
				<p>Romain Rolland and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency 
				for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed 
				except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in NKVD prisoner 
				massacres in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, 
				Bukharin's wife, Anna Larina, was sent to a labor camp, but she 
				survived to see her husband rehabilitated.<br>

				<b>The first five Marshals of the Soviet Union in November, 
				1935. (l-r): <br>
				Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Semyon Budyonny, Kliment Voroshilov, 
				Vasily Blyukher, Aleksandr Yegorov. <br>
				Only Voroshilov and Budyonny survived the Great Purge.<br>
				<br>
				</b><br>
				The purge of the Red Army was claimed to be supported by 
				Nazi-forged documents (said to have been correspondence between 
				Marshal Tukhachevsky and members of the German high command).</p>
				<p>The claim is, however, unsupported by facts, since by the 
				time the documents were supposedly created, two people from the 
				eight in the Tukhachevsky group were already imprisoned, and by 
				the time the document was said to reach Stalin, the purging 
				process was already underway. However the actual evidence 
				introduced at trial was obtained from forced confessions. The 
				purge of the army removed three of five marshals (then 
				equivalent to six-star generals), 13 of 15 army commanders (then 
				equivalent to four- and five-star generals), eight of nine 
				admirals (the purge fell heavily on the Navy, who were suspected 
				of exploiting their opportunities for foreign contacts), 50 of 
				57 army corps commanders, 154 out of 186 division commanders, 16 
				of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.</p>
				<p>Viktor Suvorov, in his The Cleansing (&#1054;&#1095;&#1080;&#1097;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;), writes that 
				the impact of the purge on the Red Army was not as severe as was 
				claimed later; in fact he suggests that it was beneficial to the 
				Red Army, and was not Stalin's blunder as usually claimed. Of 
				all the victims, not more than one-third were actually army 
				officials. Of the remainder, one-third were commissars � 
				political supervisors � and one-third were NKVD officials who 
				wore military ranks. For example, one of the most senior 
				executed was the minister of navy affairs, former deputy 
				minister internal affairs (NKVD), Mikhail Frinovsky (&#1052;.&#1055;. 
				&#1060;&#1088;&#1080;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;) who wore the rank of &quot;Army-commander 1st rank&quot;, 
				although he never in his life served in the army.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">The wider purge<br>
				<br>
				</font>Eventually almost all of the Bolsheviks who had played 
				prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917, or in 
				Lenin's Soviet government afterwards, were executed. Out of six 
				members of the original Politburo during the 1917 October 
				Revolution who lived until the Great Purge, Stalin himself was 
				the only one who remained in the Soviet Union, alive. Four of 
				the other five were executed. The fifth, Leon Trotsky, went into 
				exile in Mexico after being expelled from the Party but was 
				assassinated by Soviet agent Ram�n Mercader in 1940. Of the 
				seven members elected to the Politburo between the October 
				Revolution and Lenin's death in 1924, four were executed, one 
				(Tomsky) committed suicide and two (Molotov and Kalinin) lived. 
				Of 1,966 delegates to the 17th Communist Party Congress in 1934 
				(the last congress before the trials), 1,108 were arrested and 
				nearly all died. </p>
				<p>However, the trials and executions of the former Bolshevik 
				leaders, while being the most visible part, were only a minor 
				part of the purges.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Ex-kulaks and other &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot;<br>
				<br>
				<img height="282" src="images2/415/purge8.jpg" width="400" border="1"><br>
				<br>
				</font>On July 30, 1937 the NKVD Order no. 00447 was issued, 
				directed against &quot;ex-kulaks&quot; and other &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot; 
				(such as former officials of the Tsarist regime, former members 
				of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). </p>
				<p>They were to be executed or sent to GULAG prison camps 
				extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas. </p>
				<p>The order instructed to classify kulaks and other anti-Soviet 
				elements into two categories: the First category of repressed 
				was subject to death by shooting, the Second category was sent 
				to prison labor camps. The order set upper quotas per territory 
				and category. For example Byelorussian SSR was estimated to have 
				2,000 (1st cat.) + 10,000 (2nd cat.) = 12,000 anti-Soviet 
				elements. It was specifically stressed that quotas were 
				estimates and could not be exceeded without personal approval of 
				Yezhov. But in practice this approval was easy to obtain, and 
				eventually these initial quotas were exceeded by orders of 
				magnitude. For example, in September 1937, the Dagestan obkom 
				requested the increase of the First Category from 600 to 1,200; 
				the request was granted the next day. </p>
				<p>The implementation was swift. Already by August 15, 1937, 
				101,000 were arrested and 14,000 convicted.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">National operations of NKVD<br>
				</font><br>
				A series of national operations of the NKVD was carried out 
				during 1937�1940, justified by the fear of the fifth column in 
				the expectation of war with &quot;the most probable adversary&quot;, i.e., 
				Germany, as well as according to the notion of the &quot;hostile 
				capitalist surrounding&quot;, which wants to destabilize the country. 
				The Polish operation of the NKVD was the first of this kind, 
				setting an example of dealing with other targeted minorities. 
				Many such operations were conducted on a quota system. NKVD 
				local officials were mandated to arrest and execute a specific 
				number of &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;, produced by upper officials 
				based on various statistics.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Timeline of the Great Purge<br>
				</b>The Great Purge of 1936�1938 can be roughly divided into 
				four periods:</p>
				<p>1.October 1936�February 1937 <br>
				Reforming the security organizations, adopting official plans on 
				purging the elites. <br>
				<br>
				2.March 1937�June 1937 <br>
				Purging the Elites; Adopting plans for the mass repressions 
				against the &quot;social base&quot; of the potential aggressors, starting 
				of purging the &quot;elites&quot; from opposition.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				3.July 1937�October 1938 <br>
				Mass repressions against &quot;kulaks&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot; ethnic 
				minorities, family members of oppositions, military officers, 
				Saboteurs in agriculture and industry. <br>
				<br>
				4.November 1938�1939 <br>
				Stopping of mass operations, abolishing of many organs of 
				extrajudicial executions, repressions against some organizers of 
				mass repressions. <br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">End of Yezhovshchina<br>
				<br>
				</font>By the summer of 1938, Stalin and his circle realized 
				that the purges had gone too far; Yezhov was relieved from his 
				post as head of the NKVD and was eventually purged himself. 
				Lavrenty Beria, a fellow Georgian and Stalin confidant, 
				succeeded him as head of the NKVD. On November 17, 1938 a joint 
				decree of Sovnarkom USSR and Central Committee of VKP(b) (Decree 
				about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of 
				Investigation) and the subsequent order of NKVD undersigned by 
				Beria cancelled most of the NKVD orders of systematic repression 
				and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree 
				signaled the end of massive Soviet purges. </p>
				<p>Nevertheless, the practice of mass arrest and exile was 
				continued until Stalin's death in 1953. Political executions 
				also continued, but, with the exception of Katyn and other NKVD 
				massacres during WWII, on a vastly smaller scale. One notorious 
				example is the &quot;Night of the Murdered Poets,&quot; in which at least 
				thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on August 12, 
				1952. </p>
				<p>It should be noted that when the relatives of those who had 
				been executed in 1937-38 inquired about their fate, they were 
				told by NKVD that their arrested relatives had been sentenced to 
				&quot;ten years of imprisonment without the right to correspond with 
				anybody&quot; (&#1076;&#1077;&#1089;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100; &#1083;&#1077;&#1090; &#1073;&#1077;&#1079; &#1087;&#1088;&#1072;&#1074;&#1072; &#1087;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1087;&#1080;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;). When these ten year 
				periods elapsed in 1947-48 but the arrested did not appear, the 
				relatives asked MGB about their fate again and this time were 
				told that the arrested died in imprisonment. The causes and the 
				dates of the deaths were invented by MGB.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Western reactions<br>
				<br>
				</font>Although the trials of former Soviet leaders were widely 
				publicized, the hundreds of thousands of other arrests and 
				executions were not. These became known in the west only as a 
				few former gulag inmates reached the West with their stories. 
				Not only did foreign correspondents from the West fail to report 
				on the purges, but in many Western nations, especially France, 
				attempts were made to silence or discredit these witnesses; 
				Jean-Paul Sartre took the position that evidence of the camps 
				should be ignored, in order that the French proletariat not be 
				discouraged. A series of legal actions ensued at which 
				definitive evidence was presented which established the validity 
				of the former labor camp inmates' testimony.</p>
				<p>According to Robert Conquest in his 1968 book The Great 
				Terror: Stalin's Purge of the Thirties, with respect to the 
				trials of former leaders, some Western observers were unable to 
				see through the fraudulent nature of the charges and evidence, 
				notably Walter Duranty of The New York Times, a Russian speaker; 
				the American Ambassador, Joseph E. Davies, who reported, 
				&quot;proof...beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of 
				treason&quot; and Beatrice and Sidney Webb, authors of Soviet 
				Communism: A New Civilization. While &quot;Communist Parties 
				everywhere simply transmitted the Soviet line&quot;, some of the most 
				critical reporting also came from the left, notably The 
				Manchester Guardian.</p>
				<p>Evidence and the results of research began to appear after 
				Stalin's death which revealed the full enormity of the Purges. 
				The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita 
				Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of 
				the Communist Party USA newspaper, the Daily Worker, who, 
				following the lead of The New York Times, published the Secret 
				Speech in full.</p>
				<p>Some of the victims of the terror were American immigrants to 
				Russia, who had emigrated to Russia at the height of the Great 
				Depression in order to find work. At the height of the Terror, 
				American immigrants besieged the US embassy, begging for 
				passports so they could leave Russia. They were turned away by 
				embassy officials, only to be arrested on the pavement outside 
				by lurking NKVD agents. Many were subsequently shot dead at 
				Butovo Field near Scherbinka, south from Moscow.</p>
				<p>Efforts to minimize the extent of the Great Purge continue 
				among revisionist scholars in the United States.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Rehabilitation</font></p>
				<p>1963 postage stamp of the Soviet Union, featuring 
				Tukhachevsky following his post-death rehabilitation The Great 
				Purge was denounced by Nikita Khrushchev, who became the leader 
				of the Soviet Union after Stalin's death. In his secret speech 
				to the 20th CPSU congress in February 1956 (which was made 
				public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an 
				&quot;abuse of power&quot; by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to 
				the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the 
				victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false 
				confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was 
				politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged 
				in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the 
				Purge, the so-called Anti-Party Group. The new line on the Great 
				Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the 
				Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. </p>
				<p>Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. 
				Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial 
				of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (&quot;rehabilitated&quot;) in 
				1957. The former Politburo members Yan Rudzutak and Stanislav 
				Kosior and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent 
				in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the 
				Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. </p>
				<p>The book Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 
				1930s-50s (&#1056;&#1077;&#1072;&#1073;&#1080;&#1083;&#1080;&#1090;&#1072;&#1094;&#1080;&#1103;. &#1055;&#1086;&#1083;&#1080;&#1090;&#1080;&#1095;&#1077;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1077; &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1094;&#1077;&#1089;&#1089;&#1099; 30-50-&#1093; &#1075;&#1086;&#1076;&#1086;&#1074;) 
				(1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original 
				archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of 
				convicts, and photos. The material demonstrates in detail how 
				numerous show trials were fabricated.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Number of people executed<br>
				<br>
				</font>According to the declassified Soviet archives, during 
				1937 and 1938, the NKVD detained 1,548,367 victims, of whom 
				681,692 were shot - an average of 1,000 executions a day. 
				Historian Michael Ellman claims the best estimate of deaths 
				brought about by Soviet Repression during these two years is the 
				range 950,000 to 1.2 million, which includes deaths in detention 
				and those who died shortly after being released from the Gulag 
				as a result of their treatment in it. He also states that this 
				is the estimate which should be used by historians and teachers 
				of Russian history. According to Memorial society</p>
				<p><b>On the cases investigated by the State Security Department 
				of NKVD (GUGB NKVD): <br>
				At least 1,710,000 people were arrested <br>
				At least 1,440,000 people were sentenced <br>
				At least 724,000 were executed. Among them: <br>
				At least 436,000 people were sentenced to death by NKVD troikas 
				as part of the Kulak operation <br>
				At least 247,000 people were sentenced to death by NKVD Dvoikas' 
				and the Local Special Troykas as part of the Ethnic Operation
				<br>
				At least 41,000 people were sentenced to death by Military 
				Courts <br>
				Among other cases in October 1936-November 1938: <br>
				At least 400,000 were sentenced to labor camps by Police Troikas 
				as Socially Harmful Elements (&#1089;&#1086;&#1094;&#1080;&#1072;&#1083;&#1100;&#1085;&#1086;-&#1074;&#1088;&#1077;&#1076;&#1085;&#1099;&#1081; &#1101;&#1083;&#1077;&#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1090;, &#1057;&#1042;&#1069;)
				<br>
				At least 200,000 were exiled or deported by Administrative 
				procedures <br>
				At least 2 million were sentenced by courts for common crimes, 
				among them 800,000 were sentenced to Gulag camps. <br>
				<br>
				</b>Some experts believe the evidence released from the Soviet 
				archives is understated, incomplete or unreliable. For example, 
				Robert Conquest suggests that the probable figure for executions 
				during the years of the Great Purge is not 681,692, but some two 
				and a half times as high. He believes that the KGB was covering 
				its tracks by falsifying the dates and causes of death of 
				rehabilitated victims.<br>
				<b><br>
				</b><br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><font size="4">Soviet investigation commissions<br>
				<br>
				</font>At least two Soviet commissions investigated the 
				show-trials after Stalin's death. The first was headed by 
				Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Suslov, Furtseva, 
				Shvernik, Aristov, Pospelov and Rudenko. They were given the 
				task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, 
				Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky and others. The commission worked in 
				1956�1957. While stating that the accusations against 
				Tukhachevsky et al. should be abandoned, it failed to fully 
				rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although 
				the final report does contain an admission that the accusations 
				have not been proven during the trials and &quot;evidence&quot; had been 
				produced by lies, blackmail, and &quot;use of physical influence&quot;. 
				Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as 
				political opponents, and though the charges against them were 
				obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because 
				&quot;for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the 
				building of socialism in USSR&quot;. </p>
				<p>The second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and 
				was headed by Shvernik (&quot;Shvernik Commission&quot;). It included 
				Shelepin, Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard 
				work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the 
				mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, 
				Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based 
				its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former 
				NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. 
				The commission recommended to rehabilitate every accused with 
				exception of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials 
				required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and 
				one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges 
				against him had to be dropped too, he was not a &quot;spy&quot;, etc.). 
				The commission stated: </p>
				<p>Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist 
				party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide 
				revolutionary movement... Together with Stalin, the 
				responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted 
				repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent 
				people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov.... <br>
				However, soon Khrushchev was deposed and the &quot;Thaw&quot; ended, so 
				most victims of the three show-trials were not rehabilitated 
				until Gorbachev's time.<br>
				<br>
&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b>Mass graves and memorials<br>
				</b>Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, numerous mass 
				graves filled with executed victims of the terror were 
				discovered. Some, such as the killing fields at Kurapaty near 
				Minsk and Bykivnia near Kiev, are believed to contain up to 
				200,000 corpses.</p>
				<p>In 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, 
				was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism. From 
				August 1937 through October 1938, more than 20,000 people were 
				shot and buried there.<br>
