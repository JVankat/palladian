Designing for Disabled People in Home Zones</h1><hr />



<a name="03"></a><h2>3.0 Site Tests</h2>

<p>Data was gathered from a number of Home Zones (n=11) using semi structured
site tests from a sample of disabled and non-disabled participants (n=73).</p>

<h3>3.1 Method for Selection of Home Zones</h3>

<p>The method of selection of the Home Zones to be considered in the project was
clearly an important part of the research process. There is no 'blueprint' for Home
Zones and so selection as originally proposed was to be based around the criteria
(see section 1.1) taking into account the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether a Home Zone was a Challenge or Non-Challenge site;</li>
<li>whether a Home Zone: was a retrofit or new build project;</li>
<li>the social status of the area in which the Home Zone was situated;</li>
<li>the area of the UK;</li>
<li>the availability of existing statistical information to allow for assessments to be made of safety audits and/or previous residents surveys.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the research team decided that to classify and select the Home Zones to
be considered using only the above criteria would lead to some key issues not
being fully addressed. These issues included, for example, how the different
layouts of a Home Zone might either affect or be affected by disabled people
themselves, especially when considering the various activities that may take place
within a Home Zone environment. Therefore, the findings of the literature review
were also used to develop and hone the key issues that the research team felt
should be considered in the selection of the sites.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 The Findings of the Literature Reviews</h4>

<p>The Literature review undertaken by JMU identified a number of issues that had the
potential to affect the safety and mobility of disabled people when using Home
Zones. It was established that these issues could be categorised into three stages
of a Home Zone's implementation identified as 'development', 'design' and
'success'. These are fully described in Section 5.1 of the JMU Literature Review
(see also <a href="ab.htm">Appendix B</a>). These stages will now be briefly described.</p>

<h4>3.1.1.1 Development</h4>

<p>As there is no blueprint for Home Zones, it was decided that an aim of the project
should be to investigate the development process of a site in terms of how the
design of a site and its subsequent accessibility had been influenced by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consultation with disabled people;</li>
<li>Cost restraints;</li>
<li>The influence of issues such as being in a conservation area;</li>
<li>Any National Joint Utilities Group (NJUG) activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was decided to select one site for which consultation with disabled people had
been carried out in accordance with best practice recommendations, and one site
where no consultation was undertaken.</p>

<h4>3.1.1.2 Design Practicalities</h4>

<p>Individual Home Zones may utilise similar design elements, but each Home Zone
also needs to reflect the aspirations of the community it serves. The literature
review identified key design principles which were also used in the selection of the
test sites. These included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generic issues to be tested in all sites such as, for example, the provision of
lighting, street furniture, materials, planting etc (see also Sections 3.3.1 later in
this report and 6.2 in <a href="ab.htm">Appendix B</a>);</li>
<li>Non-generic issues that can have an impact on the safety and mobility of
disabled people including, for example, shared surfaces, indirect traffic routes
and the presence (or otherwise) of guidance paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore sites were selected that displayed features whereby the research team
could examine the use by disabled people of the following layouts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shared Surfaces</li>
<ul>
<li>Complete removal of delineation between vehicles and pedestrians;</li>
<li>Some delineation of vehicles and pedestrians by:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Standard height kerbs.</li>
  <li>Low height kerbs.</li>
  <li>Delineation using visual contrast (colour) and/or surface texture.</li>
</ul></ul>
<li>Indirect Traffic Routes</li>
<ul>
<li>Clear continuous pedestrian-only route provided.</li>
<li>No provision of clear continuous pedestrian route.</li>
</ul>
<li>Guidance Path</li>
<ul>
<li>Provision of a guidance path through the Zone.</li>
</ul></ul>

<h4>3.1.1.3 Scheme with Known Difficulties for Disabled People</h4>

<p>The literature review identified that Darcy Gardens in Barking and Dagenham had
previously been highlighted by the JCMBPS as being a site that had been identified
as adversely affecting the navigation of blind and partially sighted people. Although
not designated as a Home Zone, the site contains many features that are present in
other Home Zones. After further discussion about the issues at this site it was
selected for examination in this research project.</p>

<h4>3.1.1.4 Number of Schemes Selected</h4>

<p>In response to the above selection process, a total of 10 home zones schemes and
one further site were selected, this included 8 Challenge Home Zones, 1 English
non challenge scheme which was retrofitted, 1 new pilot scheme in Scotland and
the site discussed in section 3.1.1.3 which was previously identified as presenting
difficulties for disabled people.</p>

<h3>3.2 Selected Schemes</h3>

<p>The selected Home Zones demonstrated a wide geographical spread throughout
the UK, a mix of both new and retrofit sites with the inclusion of some sites that had
been included as either Pilot or Challenge sites. The selection was as follows:</p>

<h4>3.2.1 Southville (Bristol)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone has a shared surface (no delineation between vehicles and
pedestrians) with parking present which is not designated via colour surface or
bollards.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.1: Southville Home Zone</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/01.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1: Southville Home Zone" width="363" height="269" /></p> 

<h4>3.2.2 Former Royal Infirmary, Constitution Road (Dundee)</h4>

<p>This new build Home Zone has a shared surface with limited delineation via a low
height kerb. The kerb delineates the highway and garden area which provides a
limited pedestrian area and therefore freedom of movement.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.2: Former Royal Infirmary Home Zone</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/02.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2: Former Royal Infirmary Home Zone" width="366" height="275" /></p> 

<h4>3.2.3 Lupton Street (London Borough of Camden)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone has various fixed above surface features (that allow
freedom of movement - bollards, trees, planters, bins etc) and has a limited use of
colour contrast to demarcate space.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.3: Lupton Street Home Zone</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/03.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3: Lupton Street Home Zone" width="378" height="284" /></p> 

<h4>3.2.4 Staiths South Bank (Gateshead)</h4>

<p>This new-build Home Zone has various fixed above surface features (that restrict
freedom of movement - long walls, long planters). In addition it has various nonfixed
above surface features e.g. designated and non-designated car parking.
While some areas may have clear pedestrian routes, there are other areas where a
pedestrian route is not clear. The scheme also makes use of many planted areas.</p>

<p><img src="images/04.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4: Staiths South Bank Home Zone" width="380" height="283" /></p> 

<h4>3.2.5 Albany Street (Kingston Upon Hull)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone makes use of a kerb (which restricts free movement). A
kerb line with 2m clear distance from the back of the footway to the kerb was
utilised at the request of local groups of blind and partially sighted people. This was
kept free from any street furniture. Conservation kerbs with a 450mm splay and
50mm upstand used.</p>

<h4>3.2.6 Suningdale Road and Castle Grove (Portchester, Hampshire)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone provides a clear continuous pedestrian route. It has a
clear 1.2m width adjacent to property boundaries to assist blind and partially
sighted people.</p>

<h4>3.2.7 Duke of Edinburgh Way (Malvern, Worcestershire)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone demonstrates additional features for improved access.
Additional tactile paving is included at key crossing points to alert blind and partially
sighted residents of the most direct route into and out of the estate, along with
corduroy tactile paving at steps.</p>

<h4>3.2.8 Morice Town (Plymouth)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone has fixed above surface features (that restrict freedom of
movement such as long walls). The space has several routes that utilise bollards
and planters and also has non-fixed above surface features such as car parking.</p>

<p><img src="images/08.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8: Morice Town Home Zone" width="410" height="304" /></p> 

<h4>3.2.9 Maryatt Avenue (London Borough of Harrow)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone has an upstand measuring 15mm in height of a
contrasting, coloured, chamfered type block on both sides of the street delineating
where the existing kerbs are currently in place.</p>

<h4>3.2.10 Magor Village (Monmouthshire)</h4>

<p>This retrofit Home Zone has fixed above surface features (that allow freedom of
movement such as bollards, trees, planters, bins etc). The Home Zone also uses
texture to demarcate space containing various different surface types including:
Tegula Blocked paving, Stonemaster Flag paved area and cobbled areas.</p>

<h3>3.3 Test Methodology</h3>

<p>The nature of the individual Home Zones examined in this project varied from zone
to zone, although some of the characteristics were identified as being generic to all
sites. Therefore, it was established early in the project that the varying features and
designs found within the individual sites would require the development of a test
procedure that was flexible enough to allow the strategies people adopted in
moving around and making decisions to be observed and recorded, whilst
maintaining a valuable thread of comparability between Home Zones.</p>

<p>Of the five main senses available to users when gathering information (vision,
hearing, touch, smell and taste), it was considered that the participants in the tests
would most likely utilise only three of these (vision, hearing and touch) when
undertaking the proposed tasks. It was expected that they would maximise these
senses depending on their own individual residual abilities and the tests undertaken
were designed to reflect this.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 Classifying Home Zone Features</h4>

<p>To establish this thread a methodology was adopted whereby individual features
commonly found within Home Zones could be described in generic terms of how
they may affect the use of the Zone, rather than by their name. For example,
bollards, waste paper bins, trees, lampposts and individual seats, are often found in
Home Zones and can often be used to delineate space.</p>

<p>However, all of these features can be categorised as features that project above
ground level and delineate space whilst still allowing freedom of movement and
decision on the part of the users. Conversely, a continuous planter, flower bed or
row of seating would not.</p>

<p>What was considered to be important was to determine from the users how the
presence or absence of such features affected their ability, confidence etc, when
using the Home Zone, not simply the identification of the features that were
present. This, it was felt, would also allow the development of more generic and
'designer-friendly' design guidance at the end of the research.</p>

<p>Therefore, for this project, Home Zone features were considered in terms of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information at surface level to delineate space and activity:<br />
For example, the use of visual contrast to identify hazards or give information about features that assists navigation or segregation of activities.</li>
<li>The provision of physical features at ground level to delineate space and activities:<br />
For example, tactile surfaces to identify hazards or give information about features that assist navigation or segregation of activities, and which project sufficiently above surface level to be detectable.</li>
<li>The provision of physical features that project above ground level to delineate space or activities but which allow users a good degree of freedom of movement and decision making:<br />
For example, bollards, trees, planters, lampposts, individual seating etc.</li>
<li>The provision of physical features that project above ground level to delineate space or activities but which <strong>do not</strong> allow users a good degree of freedom of movement and decision making:<br />
For example, continuous or long length planters, rows of seating, railings etc.</li>
<li>The effect of lighting (natural and artificial).</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.3.2 Recording of Data</h4>

<p>Measurable data was gathered using an audit of the site, the design of which was
based on the findings of the literature review which is a combination of design
guidelines outlined in the IHIE and other Home Zone documents and, where
appropriate, other best practice guidance in the access field. Much of the data
captured from the subsequent site tests was qualitative.</p>

<p>Participants were asked to consider and offer comments on how they orientated
and navigated around a site, and between two specific points within the site. During
and after the test they were asked about decision points, crossing points and their
preferred route. A number of participants were videoed during their navigation task
and this information was used to supplement other recorded data.</p>

<p>The individual nature of Home Zones meant that it was not possible to select a
navigation task for participants that was identical in all test locations. However,
across the sites the tests did consider the interaction of the participants with the
generic issues described earlier (for example, the provision of lighting, visual
contrast, street furniture), and also any non-generic issues found at individual test
sites. These included, for example, any differences in implementation of the design
of site layout, with reference to application of the 'shared space' concept.</p>

<p>A questionnaire about general issues and experience was used to gather
information about participant behaviour and opinion on issues related to navigation
and safety. The findings of this questionnaire are described in Section 7.3 (see also <a href="ae.htm">Appendix E</a>).</p>

<p>As the information gathered in this process was complex, a coding system was
used in the analysis of the data.</p>

<p><p>Note:<br />
The coding system used assigned interpretive tags to text based on relevant
categories and themes (Cope, 2003). The method adopted is one that is
encouraged in the Magenta Book (Government Chief Social Researchers
Office, 2004), which outlines "Thematic data ordering in which raw data from
different cases are brought together under thematic headings" (Government
Chief Social Researchers Office, 2004).</p>

<p>In the analysis, data was broken down into statements under headings such
as 'ease of movement', 'colour contrast', 'surface texture and layout', etc and
entered into a qualitative software program (XSight, QSR International).
Within this program, statements are broadly classified according to whether
they were 'positive' or 'negative', and this allows the study to compare any
patterns experienced with different features/layouts and experiences of
people with similar impairments.</p></p>

<h4>3.3.3 Changes in Methodology</h4>

<p>In the earlier development phases of the project, the proposal was to gather a
greater degree of quantitative data than was actually possible.</p>

<p>The changed strategy took place following the pilot test when it was identified that
the method of data gathering originally proposed for the navigation task was not
practical for this project, and there were a number of reasons for this.</p>

<p>Initially, it was proposed to adopt a methodology first established in the FIT project
(Yohannes et al, 2004), which examined the navigation and identification strategies
used by blind and partially sighted people when negotiating unfamiliar internal
transport environments.</p>

<p>However, the pilot test identified certain factors relating to Home Zones, such as,
for example, the need to negotiate surfaces shared with moving vehicular traffic,
resulting in the need to adapt the original methodology.

<h3>3.4 Participant Profiles</h3>

<h4>3.4.1 Gender and Age</h4>

<p>Of the 73 participants who took part in the site tests, 40 (55%) were male and 33
(45%) were female. Whilst some participants were under the age of 35, the
majority were older. The age range with the greatest number of participants was 35
to 49 years. See Figure 3.12.</p>
