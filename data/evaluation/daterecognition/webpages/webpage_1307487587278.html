We are hopeful of achieving that target as some sectors have already started picking up after the introduction of stimulus package,&#8221; CBEC member V. Sridhar told reporters.</p><p>Agreeing that collections from customs duty would be lower as imports had gone down during January-February, he said the automobile and steel sectors were now showing growth.</p><p>The CBEC will automate all its services used by large tax paying units nationwide by October this year after the completion of its six pilot projects, he said.</p><p>Large tax paying units are the ones that pay more than Rs.50 million as central excise or service taxes or more than Rs.100 million as corporate tax.</p><p>&#8220;The six pilot projects will be rolled out by the end of this month. We will introduce different automation modules - electronic registration, electronic filing, refunds and others in phases. Once the software glitches are sorted out, nationwide roll-out will be possible,&#8221; Sridhar said.</p><p>According to him, the automation project, including setting up of a central data centre in Delhi and a disaster recovery centre in Chennai, is being implemented at a cost of Rs.5.8 billion (Rs.580 crore).</p><p>Y.G. Parande, director general-systems at the CBEC, said all large units in Bangalore has gone online now where the department has launched electronic registration and filing facility.</p> <!-- google_ad_section_end --><div id="fb-like" style="border:none; width:552px; min-height:82px; height:auto !important; height:82px;"> <iframe allowtransparency="true" src="" id="facebook-like" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="borde
