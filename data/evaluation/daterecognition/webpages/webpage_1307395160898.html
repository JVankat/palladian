			<p><b>Is this tax deduction for new construction or 
			renovations or both?</b></p>
			<p>Both.</p>
			<p><b>What is the effective date for taking advantage of this tax 
			deduction?</b> <br>
			<br>
			The provision is effective for property placed in service after 
			December 31, 2005, and prior to J<strike>anuary 1, 2008</strike>.&nbsp;
			<b>[NOTE: The EPAct 2005 tax deductions have been extended to 
			December 31, 2013.]</b> For tax purposes, 
			&quot;placed in service&quot; generally means the time at which the property 
			is ready for its intended use.</p>
			<p><b>What types of buildings will qualify? What types of 
			expenditures will qualify?</b><br>
			<br>
			Section 1331 of H.R. 6 provides that energy-efficient commercial 
			building property is defined as property that is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><font size="1">Installed on or in any building located in 
				the United States that is within the scope of Standard 
				90.1-2001, Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise 
				Residential Buildings, of the American Society of Heating, 
				Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers and the 
				Illuminating Engineering Society of North America;</font></li>
				<li><font size="1">Installed as part of (i) the interior 
				lighting systems, (ii) the heating, cooling, ventilation, and 
				hot water systems, or (iii) the building envelope; and</font></li>
				<li><font size="1">Certified as being installed as part of a 
				plan designed to reduce the total annual energy and power costs 
				of interior lighting systems, heating, cooling, ventilation, and 
				hot water systems of the building by 50 percent or more when 
				compared to a reference building, which meets the minimum 
				requirements of Standard 90.1-2001 (as in effect on April 2, 
				2003). </font></li>
			</ol>
			<p><font style="font-size: 9pt"><b>If a building were designed to a 
			newer building standard, wouldnt it already satisfy the conditions 
			for the tax deduction?</b><br>
			<br>
			Not likely. Although lighting power densities in, for example, 
			ASHRAE 90.1-2004 are almost low enough to satisfy the interim 
			lighting LPDs, the lighting controls requirements of the interim 
			lighting provision go beyond those of 90.1-2004. During the 
			development of the legislation care was taken to insure that free 
			riders would be minimal.</font></p>
			<p><font style="font-size: 9pt"><br>
			<b>Can portions of buildings be retrofitted and still qualify for a 
			deduction; for example; the common area versus tenant spaces; or a 
			portion of the common area?</b><br>

			<p><b>Do public buildings qualify for this tax deduction?</b></p>
			<p>For energy-efficient commercial building property expenditures 
			made by a public entity, such as public schools, the secretary of 
			the treasury shall promulgate regulations that allow the deduction 
			to be allocated to the person primarily responsible for designing 
			the property in lieu of the public entity.</p>

			<p><b>May labor costs be included in the calculation of tax 
			deductions?</b></p>
			<p>At this time it appears that labor costs that are capitalized (as 
			is the case generally with new construction) can be included while 
			those that are expensed (as is the case in general with renovations) 
			may not. We are waiting for additional clarity from DOE/IRS on this 
			topic.</p>
			<p><b>What is the tax deduction amount?</b><br>
			<br>
			The deduction is equal to energy-efficient commercial building 
			property expenditures made by the taxpayer, subject to a cap. The 
			deduction is limited to an amount equal to $1.80 per square foot of 
			the property for which such expenditures are made. The deduction is 
			allowed in the year in which the property is placed in service. For 
			tax purposes, &quot;placed in service&quot; generally means the time at which 
			the property is ready for its intended use.</p>
			<p><b>After the deduction is taken how is the remaining asset value 
			handled?</b><br>
			<br>
			As stated in the provision, the basis of the property is reduced by 
			the deduction amount and the remaining asset value is depreciated 
			over its tax life for the class of property.</p>
			<p><b>The math involved in calculating the tax deduction may result 
			in a value between $0.30 and $0.60 that is a fraction with multiple 
			decimal places, such as $0.4287/sq.ft. Will there be a regulation 
			regarding rounding, or will the exact numbers be applied (e.g., 
			$0.4287 x 1000 sq.ft. is $428.70, while $0.43 x 1000 sq.ft. is 
			$430.00)? </b><br>
			<br>
			There probably will be no mention of rounding in the regulations.</p>
			<p><b>Is it the case that per ASHRAE/IES 90.1 the maximum possible 
			wattage for the fixture will be applied?</b> <br>
			<br>
			The luminaire wattage to be used in the power calculation depends on 
			the type of lighting technology (see ASHRAE 90.1-2001 Section 
			9.2.5). Please consult lighting designers and manufacturers as to 
			what wattage would be appropriate for &quot;lamp/auxiliary&quot; combinations. </p>

			<br>
			<b>Are there certification requirements and if so, what are they?</b><br>
			<br>
			Certain certification requirements must be met in order to qualify 
			for the deduction. The secretary of treasury, in consultation with 
			the secretary of energy, will promulgate regulations that describe 
			methods of calculating and verifying energy and power costs, using 
			qualified computer software based on the provisions of the 2005 
			California Nonresidential Alternative Calculation Method Approval 
			Manual or, in the case of residential property, the 2005 California 
			Residential Alternative Calculation Method Approval Manual. These 
			regulations are currently being drafted by DOE in consultation with 
			Treasury Department officials in advance of the implementation date 
			of January 1, 2006.</p>
			<p><b>Will there be inspections of buildings to determine 
			compliance? Who will do them?</b><br>
			<br>
			The secretary of the treasury shall prescribe procedures for the 
			inspection and testing for compliance of buildings that are 
			comparable to the requirements in the Mortgage Industry National 
			Accreditation Procedures for Home Energy Rating Systems. Individuals 
			qualified to determine compliance shall only be those recognized by

			<p><b>Are partial deductions allowed for building subsystems instead 
			of a whole building deduction?<br>
			</b><br>
			In the case of a building that does not meet the whole building 
			requirement of a 50 percent energy savings, a partial deduction is 
			allowed with respect to each separate building system that comprises 
			energy-efficient property and which is certified by a qualified 
			professional as meeting or exceeding the applicable system savings 
			targets established by the secretary of the treasury.<br>
			<br>
			The applicable system savings targets to be established by the 
			secretary are those that would result in a total annual energy 
			savings of 50 percent for the whole building, if each of the 
			separate systems met the system target; note that the maximum 
			allowable deduction is $0.60 per square foot. The separate building 
			systems are the: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Interior lighting system; </li>
				<li>Heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water systems; and
				</li>
				<li>Building envelope.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>What are the interim rules for lighting projects?</b><br>
			<br>
			Building owners are encouraged under the law to focus first on 
			lighting systems for two reasons: first, their ease and availability 
			of upgrading, and second, the known achievements in energy 
			efficiency that will be gained. In the case of a lighting system 
			(including the retrofit of an existing system), until such time as 
			the secretary of the treasury issues final regulations, the system 
			energy savings target for the lighting system is deemed to be met by 
			a reduction in lighting power density of 40 percent (50 percent in 
			the case of a warehouse) of the minimum requirements in Table 
			9.3.1.1 or Table 9.3.1.2 of ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2001 (as in 
			effect on April 2, 2003). Note that in the case of other building 
			systems (i.e., HVAC systems and the building envelope), partial 
			deductions are generally not allowed until the secretary establishes 
			system targets for such systems.<br>
			<br>
			In the case of a lighting system that reduces lighting power density 
			by 25 percent, a partial deduction of $0.30 per square foot is 
			allowed. A pro-rated partial deduction is allowed in the case of a 
			lighting system that reduces lighting power density between 25 and 
			40 percent. Certain lighting level and lighting control requirements 
			must also be met in order to qualify for the partial interim 
			lighting deductions. </p>
			<p><b>Is bi-level switching required for the interim lighting 
			provision? </b><br>
			<br>
			Yes, as stated in the legislation, bi-level switching is required 
			for the interim provision. It is not required, but may be used in 
			the whole building approach as a means to reduce energy use in the 
			annual cost calculation needed for compliance with the provision.</p>
			<p><b>I have seen several different definitions of bi-level 
			switching, for example in California and New York rules. What is the 
			definition? </b><br>
			<br>
			Some state regulations define bi-level switching in a particular way 
			for their own jurisdictions. These are specific applications of a 
			more general approach. Bilevel switching is defined as manual or 
			automatic control (or a combination thereof) that provides two 
			levels of lighting power in a space (not including off). A space is 
			defined as an area enclosed by four or more floor to ceiling walls. 
			Dimming or switching would satisfy this definition. Of course, 
			besides satisfying the tax deduction requirements, an installation 
			would also have to satisfy whatever the regulations are for the 
			jurisdiction, which may, but typically dont, require bi-level 
			switching.</p>
			<p><b>For the purposes of the tax deduction, what luminaire wattage 
			do I assume for the watts per square foot calculation? </b><br>
			<br>
			The interpretation from ASHRAE is as follows:<br>
			<br>
			&quot;The intent of section 9.1.4 (b) in ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-2004 is to 
			ensure that the calculation of wattage for lighting compliance 
			includes ballast and/or transformer energy for the lighting 
			equipment that is to be installed and used. If the actual equipment 
			to be installed and used is not known or specified, than the maximum 
			lamp/auxiliary combination becomes the basis for wattage 
			calculation. However, it was never the intent of the requirement 
			that installed lamp/auxiliary combinations drawing lower wattage 
			than the maximum should be penalized at the maximum value. 
			Therefore, similar to the language included for screw-based socket 
			luminaires in 9.1.4 (a), the &quot;maximum labeled wattage&quot; 
			(lamp/auxiliary combination for the maximum lamp wattage allowed by 
			the label) of a luminaire could be used for wattage calculation of 
			luminaires with permanently installed or remote ballasts or 
			transformers. <br>
			<br>
			Note1: a proposed change to the standard for the 2007 version will 
			add this additional language to 9.1.4 (b) <br>
			Note2: This informal interpretation also applies to the 1999 and 
			2001 versions of the standard.&quot;</p>

			<p><b><u><font color="#E55839" size="2"><a name="Owner_vs_Tenant">
			Owner vs Tenant</a></font></u></b></p>
			<p><b>What if a commercial building tenant performs a retrofit that 
			would meet the energy savings, would they get the deduction? Is the 
			deduction for privately owned buildings restricted to the owner or 
			can a management company or a tenant in a leased space take 
			advantage of the deduction? The tax deduction is to be given to the 
			owner of the lighting system. Do you believe this enables ESCOs, if 
			they own the lighting system until the end of their performance 
			contracts, to claim the tax deduction for themselves as the legal 
			owner of the lighting system? Could the building owner even do it 
			legally if the ESCO is the owner under the performance contract? </b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Unfortunately, as in many matters of tax law, the question is not 
			Necessarily clear. The person who gets the CBTD deduction is the 
			person who owns the property for tax purposes. Although in many, if 
			not most instances, a tenant improvement will revert to the landlord 
			as the end of a lease, the property is not necessarily owned by the 
			landlord for tax purposes. It is a question of fact and the 
			determination depends on the arrangements between the parties. If 
			the tenant pays for the investment, constructs it according to its 
			owns specs, and there are no concessions in the lease or from the 
			landlord, it is likely that the tenant will be the owner of the 
			improvements for tax purposes and eligible to claim the CBTD 
			deduction.<br>
			<br>
			Fortunately, this is a question that arose under the tax law before 
			the enactment of the CBTD. In the case of tenant improvements, the 
			tenant and landlord would have to determine who is the tax owner for 
			purposes of claiming depreciation deductions in nay event. The CBTD 
			does not change that determination. The CBTD simply provides a more 
			beneficial deduction that that normally provided by depreciation.<br>
			<br>
			The analysis is the same regarding improvements in government 
			buildings. If the contractor is the owner for tax purposes, it can 
			claim the CBTD. Whether a private person can be an owner of property 
			with respect to a government building under the applicable local law 
			is a factor that would have to be taken into account in determining 
			who is the owner for tax purposes.</p>

			<p><b>Are exit signs included in the program; and if so; can they be 
			retrofits versus new signs?</b><br>
			<br>
			No, ASHRAE 90.1-2001 does not allow exit signs to be considered in 
			the lighting power allowance determinations.</p>
			<p><b>Are screw in compact fluorescent lamps included; and if so; is 
			there any requirement for permanence?</b><br>
			<br>
			No, screw in CFLs could not be used to reduce wattage for purposes 
			of the deduction. The ASHRAE 90.1-2001 lighting power calculations 
			require that the maximum labeled wattage of incandescent luminaire 
			be used.</p>
			<p><b>Is there a criterion for what type of lighting systems qualify 
			for the partial tax deduction? For example, in a manufacturing 
			facility, would task lighting upgrades qualify if the LPD is reduced 
			by enough to obtain the deduction? Or is the deduction for ceiling 
			lighting system upgrades? </b><br>
			<br>
			The legislation does not specify lighting technology for the tax 
			deduction. The applicability of task lighting would typically turn 
			on the question of whether it is &quot;permanently installed&quot;. ASHRAE 
			90.1-2001 defines &quot;permanently installed&quot; as &quot;equipment that is 
			fixed in place and is not portable or movable&quot; . To be considered, 
			then, the task lighting would need to satisfy this definition.</p>
