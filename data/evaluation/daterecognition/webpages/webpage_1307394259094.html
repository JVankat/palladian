			for the Optura 100MC Camcorder from Canon USA</font></span></i><font size="2" face="Arial"> <br>
			<br>
			</font></a>Being a hybrid product means that one can successfully carry the workload of two. The Optura 100MC takes
			the concept of a hybrid to a whole new level. Stunning video and razor sharp still images are flawlessly combined
			to produce a superior imaging tool. Now displaying your creation on screen or paper has the same impact: impressive.<br>
			Digital Video Format and IEEE 1394<br>
			The Canon Optura 100MC is a digital video camcorder, using the standard MiniDV cassette; it produces the highest
			quality video possible from non-broadcast equipment. The MiniDV format standard delivers more than 500 lines of
			horizontal resolution. This is about a 25% improvement in picture quality over the best analog formats. On top
			of that, because it records both video and audio as digital data, this information can be transferred -- without
			any loss of picture or audio quality -- to computer for editing, then transferred back to DV tape, without a reduction
			in either picture or audio quality. All of this is through the use of the IEEE 1394 protocol commonly known as
			FireWire&reg;.<br>
			1.33 Megapixel CCD<br>
			At the heart of the Optura 100MC is a larger CCD image sensor (larger than 1/4 inch), containing an astounding
			1.33 million pixels. This puts the Optura 100MC into the very rarified atmosphere of the highest-resolution consumer
			camcorders on the market today.<br>
			Optical Image Stabilizer<br>
			Canon's superb optical stabilization system corrects camera shake instantly so even hand-held shots, at full telephoto,
			and shots taken from a moving car, for example, are smooth and steady. And since it is optical, there is no loss
			of image quality inevitable with electronic image stabilizers. It perfectly complements the high picture quality
			of the DV format.<br>
			The shift-type optical image stabilizer used in the Optura 100MC solves the problem of blurring which cannot be
			handled by electronic image stabilizers in other camcorders. Unlike many other dual digital camcorder/camera models,
			it works on both video and photo modes.<br>
			Precision Canon Optical Zoom Lens<br>
			The Optura 100MC incorporates a newly developed, bright zoom lens, specifically designed to handle the demands
			placed on it by the camcorder's high-resolution image sensor for both video and still picture applications. The
			zoom uses a special glass originally used in Canon digital still cameras, and is the first Canon camcorder to use
			it, guaranteeing high picture quality.<br>
			The 10x optical zoom lens (4.2 - 42 mm) is the 35 mm focal length equivalent of 48 - 480 mm. Add an optional WD-43
			Wide-converter to increase the field of view to the equivalent of 34 mm for indoor shots or panoramic views, or
			add the TL-43 Tele-converter to extend your telephoto viewing to the equivalent of 816 mm.<br>
			The digital zoom kicks in at the end of the optical zoom range, and is capable of extending to a maximum of 200x.
			This is the equivalent of a 9600 mm lens on a 35 mm photo camera. The digital zoom on the Optura 100MC provides
			sharper detail than others thanks to Canon's superior lens quality. You'll reveal details too distant to be seen
			with the eye alone.<br>
			When capturing digital still images, the lens becomes an 8x zoom, the equivalent of a 45 - 360 mm lens on a 35
			mm photo camera.<br>
			Built-In Flash and Advanced Accessory Shoe<br>
			The Optura 100MC has a built-in, pop-up flash for use in digital still picture-taking. This makes it easier to
			shoot the correct exposure even when in a dark environment. The Optura 100MC will fire one flash (a pre-flash)
			to check the exposure, then fire a second time to make the correct exposure. The flash has four modes: auto, on,
			off, and red-eye reduction.<br>
			When accessories (such as the VL-3 video light or DM-50 directional microphone) compatible with the Advanced Accessory
			Shoe are attached, the Optura 100MC can exchange data with them and supply power directly to them.<br>
			Progressive Photo<br>
			The Optura 100MC offers Progressive Photo. A mechanical shutter used in combination with an interlace scan CCD
			produces still images with very little blurring. With an interlace scan CCD, a picture of a moving object will
			be blurred because of the 1/60th of a second lag between the reading of the odd and even fields that go into making
			one video frame. With Progressive Photo, this blurring has all but been removed, because the time lag has been
			eliminated by the mechanical shutter.<br>
			MultiMedia Card and SD Memory Card compatible<br>
			For the storage of digital still images, you can use either MultiMedia Cards or SD memory cards in the Optura 100MC.
			The 8 MB MultiMedia Card comes with the Optura 100MC, storing up to 17 fine quality still pictures or 32 standard
			quality images.<br>
			Color Viewfinder and 2.5&quot; LCD Screen<br>
			The Optura 100MC offers both a color viewfinder and a 2.5&quot; color flip-out LCD screen with 200,000 pixels.<br>
			The Optura 100MC offers the first tilting viewfinder for a vertical-design camcorder. Not only does this make for
			more flexible shooting, but having a viewfinder is a benefit when shooting in the daytime, as it may get too bright
			to see the LCD display clearly. Note, though, that the Optura 100MC's LCD screen is designed to deliver clear images
			even under bright sunlight.<br>
			Programmed Auto Exposure<br>
			The Optura 100MC offers both versatility to meet all exposure challenges, and ease of use when you're happy to
			let the camera make all the choices. Amazingly sophisticated circuitry and computer algorithms analyze the light
			coming through the lens to deliver proper exposure automatically under almost any lighting condition. You can also
			easily adjust the exposure system in any one of several creative ways to meet specific needs. Selecting one of
			seven exposure modes, you control how you want the video to look.<br>
			Digital Effects and Digital Faders<br>
			Show your creativity by using the special effects and digital faders available with your Optura 100MC. A wide selection
			of digital effects and faders will add visual appeal and greater imaging variety.<br>
			PCM Digital Stereo Sound<br>
			The Optura 100MC can record sound in two audio modes:<br>
			16-bit (48 kHz, 2 channels) for the highest sound quality, slightly better than CD quality, and equivalent to DAT
			tape;<br>
			12-bit (32 kHz, 2 from 4 channels) for recording on two channels (stereo 1), leaving two channels (stereo 2) open
			for post-production audio recording (narration, music, etc.).<br>
			IEEE 1394 Input and Output Terminal<br>
			The Optura 100MC is designed for the transfer of digital video and audio to and from either a PC or another IEEE
			1394 terminal-equipped camcorder or professional DV VCR. The DV terminal allows high-quality transfer with virtually
			no deterioration in quality of images. You can edit and process images by connecting the camera to a PC with the
			IEEE 1394 terminal.<br>
			Analog Video and Audio Inputs and Outputs<br>
			As well as delivering both digital video output and input with audio, the Optura 100MC is designed to handle two
			types of analog audio and video input and output: using audio/video cables (composite) or S-video.<br>
			Extended Recording Function<br>
			In addition to the standard SP mode, the 100MC's Extended Recording Function lets you choose from three more recording
			modes. Long Play (LP) gives 1.5 times the standard recording time; two additional modes give two and three times
			SP. When image data is recorded to a tape in the 2x and 3x SP modes, it is compressed twice as much as in SP and
			LP modes. In the 3x SP mode, record for up to 4 hours on an 80-minute cassette tape. Note that when recording in
			double or triple length recording mode, image quality will not be as high as SP or LP mode.<br>
