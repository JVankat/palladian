				<div class="block">By Tony Edwards<br /><br />SAN FRANCISCO, CA (July 5, 2007) 
USSoccerPlayers -- Looking for a growth property in television sports?&nbsp; 
Basketball?&nbsp; Hockey?&nbsp; How about the Gold Cup?<br /><br />When the NBA season ended, 
Commissioner David Stern was asked repeatedly about the Finals’ lowest 
television ratings for some years.&nbsp; In the NHL, the Stanley Cup Final audience 
consisted mostly of Canadian viewers and the Anaheim Ducks’ season-ticket 
holders.&nbsp; Baseball’s World Series was the same, with ratings generally 
decreasing. <br /><br />But if you’re looking for a competition where ratings are on 
the rise, how about CONCACAF international soccer and the tournament that the 
<em>New York Times </em>called the ‘anti World Cup’?<br /><br />The Gold Cup final 
between the US and Mexico on Sunday June 24 drew more than 5 million viewers on 
Univision, and the semi-final on Telefutura the previous Thursday evening 
between Mexico and Guadeloupe outdrew every other show on television between 10 
and 11pm.&nbsp; Overall on that Thursday night, TeleFutura outdrew NBC, CBS, ABC, the 
CW, and Telemundo, among men aged 18-34.&nbsp; In English and 
Spanish.<br /><br />Breaking the semi-final down by major markets, Mexico-Guadeloupe 
was the highest rated show for men 18-34 and 18-49 in Chicago, Dallas, Los 
Angeles, and San Francisco (which includes Oakland and San Jose).&nbsp; The broadcast 
was the top rated show for adults 18-49 in Los Angeles and 
Chicago.<br /><br />Admittedly, those aren’t National Football League numbers, but 
those are almost NBA numbers.&nbsp; According to Nielsen Media Research, cited by an 
<em>Associated Press </em>article on June 15, the NBA finals finished with a 
record-low 6.2 television rating on ABC. The NBA finals averaged 9.3 million 
viewers this year, down 27% from last year. <br /><br />So, a heavily promoted 
network broadcast of a series featuring perhaps the most highly marketed young 
player in the NBA, LeBron James, in real terms barely outdrew the Gold Cup.&nbsp; In 
Spanish. <br /><br />Before getting too giddy over the numbers, remember that it’s 
summer television and these games weren’t going up against new episodes of 
<em>The Office</em> or <em>Scrubs</em>.&nbsp; Nevertheless, compared with the last 
Gold Cup tourney in 2005, numbers on TeleFutura were up between 25% and 225% for 
the entire tournament in Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Dallas, and the San 
Francisco Bay Area.&nbsp; <br /><br />What does all this mean?<br /><br />Well, CONCACAF 
likes to say that the Gold Cup pays for everything else in the confederation, 
like women’s world cup qualifiers, youth development programs, and U-20 and U-17 
qualifiers and tournaments.&nbsp; One can imagine Jack Warner and Chuck Blazer making 
the most of these numbers come TV contract time.&nbsp; The downside, I guess, is that 
it gives Jack Warner another lifeline.<br /><br />Does this mean soccer is more 
popular than, say, hockey?&nbsp; On television, with Mexico playing, yes.&nbsp; Hockey has 
always been a local sport.&nbsp; The NHL’s success, in terms of season-ticket sales, 
in places like San Jose, Anaheim, and some of its more southern locations, while 
not bolstering its TV ratings, shows that with the proper marketing to the right 
crowd, teams can consistently do well in the arena.&nbsp; However, that hasn’t 
translated into selling more Sidney Crosby jerseys.<br /><br />It is no shock to say 
that the most popular soccer team in the US might be the Mexican National Team.&nbsp; 
One can only imagine how many tickets could be sold for a game between 
Manchester United and the Mexican National Team in Los Angeles or Chicago.&nbsp; Or 
even between United and Chivas Guadalajara.<br /> <br />A Chivas stripped of its 
stars recently drew 12,000 people on a Saturday night to Spartan Stadium in San 
Jose to play a Korean club team.&nbsp; Twelve thousand people who could have been 
doing something else, knowing it wasn’t the Chivas first team, paid good money 
to sit in a 70-year old stadium on bleachers to watch them. <br /><br />It would be 
easy to take the Gold Cup ratings and run with them to a place that posits 
soccer as the sport of the next decade.&nbsp; We’ve seen that happen too often since 
1966, when World Cup numbers were higher than expected and lead to the creation 
of not one, but two leagues.&nbsp; However, the bottom line remains that not enough 
people want to come out, or turn on their TVs, on a Thursday night and watch FC 
Dallas play Columbus. <br /><br />On the other hand, the Gold Cup ratings stress 
again what Soccer United Marketing executives have always known. The soccer 
audience is out there in the United States, and it’s definitely not a shrinking 
market. <br /><br /><em>Tony Edwards is a regular contributor to USSoccerPlayers. He

				<div class="block">By Tony Edwards<br /><br />SAN JOSE, CA (June 26, 2007) 
USSoccerPlayers -- The announcement of a revived San Jose Earthquakes franchise, 
owned and operated by Oakland Athletics’ general partner Lewis Wolff, is 
apparently imminent. Any such move will immediately open up the question of not 
only who would coach the team, but how the soccer part of the organization would 
be run.<br /><br />When Wolff took ownership of the A’s from Bay Area developers Ken 
Hoffman and Steve Schott in April 2005, his first move was to give general 
manager Billy Beane and president Michael Crowley contract extensions and 
partial ownership shares in the team. Wolff was not only rewarding them for 
their success on and off the field, but making it clear they were the people to 
move the A’s forward. <br /><br />Beane and Crowley are still with the American 
League team, and recently had their contracts extended through 2014. Both have 
been praised as forward-thinking, yet budget-aware leaders fronting an 
organization that has overachieved on the field.<br /><br />You could argue, 
perhaps, that the A’s organization would be the most consistently successful one 
to move to Major League Soccer from another sport, as judged by field results. 
The Athletics have had progressive on-field leadership from the likes of former 
general manager Sandy Alderson, former field manager Tony LaRussa, and now Beane 
and his group of talented scouts and assistants. Of course, there is a written 
rule that you can’t mention Beane or the A’s without Michael Lewis’ book 
<em>Moneyball</em>, which detailed Beane’s organizational philosophy of building 
a team around undervalued players and types of players.<br /><br />One aspect of 
Beane’s philosophy has been to consider the field manager, effectively a middle 
manager, and ask the question, ‘What multimillion dollar business lets a middle 
manager run the show?’ <br /><br />Hence, Beane has instituted a top-down 
philosophy, where he essentially determines where the hidden value, the 
undervalued players are. When Moneyball was written, the undervalued players 
were power hitters who could work the pitch count and take a walk along with 
high school pitchers. Now, the thinking is more of good fielding players and 
college pitchers, indicating moneyball is an evolving philosophy.<br /><br />This 
isn’t the traditional sports management structure, and Beane has taken a lot of 
heat for it. He inherited Art Howe as field manager, and despite the A’s 
improving significantly during Howe’s time in the dugout, Beane essentially 
handed him to the New York Mets. Similarly, Beane fired Howe’s successor, Ken 
Macha, after he took the A’s to the American League Championship Series, 
ostensibly because of Macha’s communication, both with the players and with 
Beane. Then, after a long search, he hired A’s bench coach Bob Geren, who was 
the best man at Beane’s wedding. <br /><br />Now, any manager is hired to be fired, 
so at some point Beane and his best man are doing to have to handle that 
tension, but for a young team with a ton of injuries, Geren seems to be doing a 
good job handling the pressure both from the games and from his involved 
boss.<br /><br />What could this mean for the Earthquakes organization? We know 
Wolff is an involved owner who gives his people the resources and space to do 
their work. A budget is involved.&nbsp; But this is MLS, where every team has about 
the same amount to spend on players, as opposed to competing with the money of 
the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels. <br /><br />Even if the same 
statistical analysis that gave rise to moneyball didn’t apply to soccer, what 
about the same organizational philosophy? Would the Quakes have a director of 
soccer who essentially set the standards for every team that wears pacific blue, 
from the academy to the MLS franchise to the WMLS franchise they are said to be 
pursuing? Who chooses which players to draft and trade for? Who essentially sets 
the tactics and formation?<br /><br />At that point, the head coach becomes the 
person who manages the first team as determined by upper management and the game 
as it happens.&nbsp; The level of control is drastically different from what’s 
expected of coaches, much less the established manager model from Britain and, 
in some instances, the National Football League where the first team coach is 
also the general manager.<br /><br />Though we’ve already seen multiple MLS teams 
tinker with the concept of a technical director with varying degrees of 
influence, it’s the coach that remains the soccer-specific person.&nbsp; Discounting 
those desperate for jobs, what coach with professional experience would fit in 
to such a system?&nbsp; Would it be expecting too much in a league like MLS?&nbsp;

their work. A budget is involved.&nbsp; But this is MLS, where every team has about 
the same amount to spend on players, as opposed to competing with the money of 
the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels. <br /><br />Even if the same 
statistical analysis that gave rise to moneyball didn’t apply to soccer, what 
about the same organizational philosophy? Would the Quakes have a director of 
soccer who essentially set the standards for every team that wears pacific blue, 
from the academy to the MLS franchise to the WMLS franchise they are said to be 
pursuing? Who chooses which players to draft and trade for? Who essentially sets 
the tactics and formation?<br /><br />At that point, the head coach becomes the 
person who manages the first team as determined by upper management and the game 
as it happens.&nbsp; The level of control is drastically different from what’s 
expected of coaches, much less the established manager model from Britain and, 
in some instances, the National Football League where the first team coach is 
also the general manager.<br /><br />Though we’ve already seen multiple MLS teams 
tinker with the concept of a technical director with varying degrees of 
influence, it’s the coach that remains the soccer-specific person.&nbsp; Discounting 
those desperate for jobs, what coach with professional experience would fit in 
to such a system?&nbsp; Would it be expecting too much in a league like MLS?&nbsp;

				<p>By Ian Plenderleith<p>It seems that since the Quakes left Spartan Stadium, attending a soccer game at SJSU is no longer much fun, judging by the experiences of former USSoccerPlayers correspondent Tony Edwards, who attended Saturday night’s game there between the US and China, and had a number of observations to offer us by e-mail:</p>

<p>&quot;First, and not SJSU's fault, the two exits on the freeway that you can access Spartan from were both clogged, and there was no sign of traffic cops anywhere to help improve the flow of traffic. </p>

<p>&quot;2. Certain parking lots were open, but certain ones closer to the stadium were not. Of course, saying &quot;parking lot&quot; in this case means, tennis courts, plural intended. </p>

<p>&quot;3. The security guards at the entrances decided that the best way to enforce the &quot;no horns/no drums/no soccer balls&quot; rule at the Stadium was to take the word ‘enforce’ literally. I saw people having their horns and, umm, balls ripped out of their hands. Now, I don't like those horns at all, but that doesn't mean you rip them out of people’s hands. </p>

<p>&quot;4. I knew there were going to be 20,000 people there, but somehow that message never really made it to the guards at the gate, who had 8 small gates open for about 800-1000 people 15 minutes before kickoff. Added to this the fine public relations practiced by the rent-a-guards. We left our line, which wasn't moving, and walked to the other side of the stadium to get in. </p>

<p>&quot;5. There was, I'm not kidding, sand in the rows where you put your feet. Sand. As far as I know, it’s not like there was motocross or something there earlier that day.</p>

<p>&quot;6. The usual Spartan complaints. No video screen, no seats (only bleachers), lousy PA system, etc.&quot;</p>

<p>So the USSF managed to attract 20,000 people for a National Team game, then organized the evening so badly that many of them might wonder whether they’d bother coming back. At least if the Quakes return to MLS next year, the last place it looks like they’ll be playing will be at Spartan Stadium.</p>

<p>The determination of the aggrieved fan is not to be underestimated. I never returned to Tottenham Hotspur’s White Hart Lane ground after a senseless run-in with an obstinate steward. Tottenham have survived without my patronage, but US soccer can’t afford to lose a single fan because of heavy-handed security, or because it failed to take a simple measure like opening up an existing parking lot to ease access to the ground.</p>

<p>As for sand under the bleachers, you can only assume that was a nice touch for any kids who might have got bored by the game, though any kid bringing a bucket and spade probably had it ripped out of his hand at the gate. </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>By Tony Edwards 
</p>

<p>USSoccerPlayers (April 17, 2007) -- It's been the vogue for Major League 
Soccer clubs to form partnerships with big name sides from abroad in recent 
years, with teams such as Real Salt Lake and the Colorado Rapids hooking up with 
Real Madrid and Arsenal, respectively. But a newer trend has seen alliances 
further down the US soccer family. 
</p>

<p>In the United Soccer Leagues, a team based in Annapolis, Md., will start out 
this season bearing the name of English second-tier side Crystal Palace (USA) in 
Division Two. And one division above them, the newborn, San Francisco-based 
California Victory will be trying to fill the gap left by the San Jose 
Earthquakes with the help of a partnership in Spain's <em>La Liga</em>. 
</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, the Victory took the field for their first-ever game, a 
scrimmage against the University of California-Berkeley. The team entered 
wearing the blue and white striped jerseys of its parent club, Spain's Deportivo 
Alaves. 
</p>

<p>In a line-up dotted with young Mexican and European players as well as a few 
former MLS veterans, the San Francisco-based team often looked like an outfit 
playing its first ever game. Cal caused problems for the professionals, 
especially down either wing, as the Victory's fullbacks struggled to keep pace. 
</p>

<p>That this game ended tied at one, and much of the Victory's better play since 
then, was largely attributable to their number 10, Berkeley product Mike Munoz, 
who is back in the Bay Area after two years in Los Angeles with Chivas USA. 
Throughout the game against Cal, Munoz delivered intelligent, space-creating 
passes. 
</p>

<p>Playing as an attacking midfielder in coach Glenn Van Straatum's 4-5-1 
formation, Munoz was the fulcrum of most of the Victory's attack. He seems to 
understand when to calm the game down and when to look for the attacking 
opportunity. Why would a player of such evident skill, even in an exhibition 
game, choose to play USL1 as opposed to sticking in MLS? 
</p>

<p>Munoz said it was a combination of conditions that brought him back to the 
Bay Area. 
</p>

<p>&quot;When I heard the Bay Area was going to have a professional soccer team, I 
immediately knew I wanted to further my career [here],&quot; Munoz said in an email 
interview. &quot;Going to Berkeley for four years and then being in L.A. with Chivas 
USA for two years made me miss the Bay. I wanted to come back.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Van Straatum pointed to another advantage the Victory has over MLS teams when 
it comes to attracting players. 
</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, opportunity,&quot; the veteran coach said. &quot;We have an alliance 
with a European club. Not only will some players from Alaves join us in time for 
the season, but our players have an opportunity to play in Spain. I tell the 
players, if you're good, you have a chance to go over there and play&quot; 
</p>

<p>Munoz echoed his coach when asked about the differences between Chivas USA 
and the Victory. 
</p>

<p>&quot;Honestly, there isn't much difference between the two clubs,&quot; he maintained. 
&quot;Chivas USA is also backed by a major international club, and I was able to have 
a great two years there. However, the Victory is also backed by a big 
international club, and [the club] is very serious in its goals and its 
professionalism.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Van Straatum continued that part of the appeal is not only being in San 
Francisco, but part of a new project. 
</p>

<p>&quot;It's an intriguing opportunity for all of us,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to build 
partnerships in the community, we want the younger fans to have local heroes, so 
kids can look at the players and think, I could play for them someday.&quot; 
</p>

<p>With players such as Munoz, and a commitment to reaching out to the community 
(this game was a benefit for two East Bay youth soccer clubs, a canny move for a 
young organization), it may be that the Victory can overcome the considerable 
obstacles any minor league team faces in a large metropolitan area, especially 
in the Bay Area. 
</p>

<p>The Bay Area sports landscape includes six major league teams in four sports, 
professional lacrosse, minor league basketball, and at least two other USL clubs 
(the Seals and the Frogs are both at the PDL level). When you add in college 
sports (Cal, Stanford, Santa Clara, St. Mary's, etc) and thriving youth sports 
in soccer, baseball, and basketball, there is a lot of competition. 
</p>

<p>Munoz, however, is optimistic. 
</p>

<p>&quot;There has been a big void since the Earthquakes left,&quot; he went on, &quot;and now 
the Victory can bring back an entertaining, hard-working professional side that 
the fans can be proud of. As professionals we have a job to win games first and 
foremost. However, this team has the potential to be more than that in a 
soccer-hungry Bay Area.&quot;

				<title><p>USNSTPA - Article</p></title><p><strong>The Italian Job</strong><br />Gianluca Vialli and Gabriele Marcotti<br />Bantam 
Press, London, 2006<br /><em>Available online</em> 
</p>

<p>By Tony Edwards 
</p>

<p>USSoccerPlayers (February 26, 2007) -- Gianluca Vialli's career as player and 
manager in Italy and England embraced two countries with starkly contrasting 
soccer styles. He was so struck by the distinctions that he has written a 
readable, thought-provoking, and well-researched book on the soccer culture in 
both countries. 
</p>

<p>&quot;The Italian Job&quot; covers everything from fan culture and his life as a 
player, to his fascinating perspective on the press and the business side of the 
game. However, it is the book's examination of the two countries' tactical 
philosophies that ought to be most beneficial to those readers with an interest 
in the future development of US soccer. 
</p>

<p>Vialli won four cups as a player and then as player-manager at Chelsea, and 
before that was a creative and respected striker for Sampdoria, Juventus and the 
Italian National Team. To write this book, he enlisted the help of Gabrielle 
Marcotti, the London-based columnist probably best known to US readers for his 
intelligent commentaries on <em>SI.com</em>. 
</p>

<p>Instead of a typical &quot;I did this and I did that&quot; autobiography, the authors 
actually commissioned research and conducted interviews with leading coaches in 
the game, such as Arsene Wenger, Alex Ferguson, Marcello Lippi and Jose 
Mourinho. A number of other lesser-known soccer figures share the credit for the 
book's thoughtful and intelligent tone. 
</p>

<p>What's the relevance for US Soccer and MLS? Besides a mention of Landon 
Donovan, Vialli and Marcotti's analysis can be applicable to our youth, 
professional and National Team development. 
</p>

<p>In English soccer, 4-4-2 is the standard formation. As Vialli notes, even 
when Sven-Goran Eriksson wanted to play a diamond midfield, his captain David 
Beckham told him the players weren't comfortable with that. Eriksson readily 
agreed, and went back to a formation the players preferred. 
</p>

<p>Vialli contrasts this with Italian players being able to play well in 
different formations and with different tactics. The book offers many reasons 
for this, with Italy's youth training and coaching culture being two of the 
principal factors. Vialli cites how EPL managers are rarely fired, and hence the 
formation doesn't often change, while in Serie A and B management isn't afraid 
to sack a coach. If your old coach played a 4-4-2 last week, and the new guy 
plays 3-5-2 this, you'd better be able to adapt. 
</p>

<p>While it might not be best for the US to completely adopt the Italian style 
of youth and professional training (which is often likened to a job, compared 
with the joy in their profession expressed by English players), it could be 
useful to take on Italy's best aspects, which include developing players of high 
technical skill and tactical flexibility. 
</p>

<p>It can start with the National Team and MLS, but tactical flexibility needs 
to begin at a much lower level. Asking a 22-year-old to adapt quickly to an 
entirely different tactical system is difficult, at best, and as any coach needs 
results to keep his or her job, it's understandable why many aren't willing to 
risk innovation. 
</p>

<p>However, coaches have to be willing to change the culture and prevent US 
soccer from becoming too much like England's in the long term. With MLS 
instituting youth development systems (and a new women's professional league 
should do the same thing), a coach with long term security and resources -- 
Bruce Arena at New York or Frank Yallop at Los Angeles -- should institute a &quot;no 
4-4-2&quot; policy in their youth development systems. 
</p>

<p>The coaches hired for the youth and reserve teams could deliberately 
emphasize technical ability and tactical flexibility -- that is, Galaxy reserves 
could play 4-3-3 one week, then 3-4-3 the next. Soccer would be less about 
imposing the coach's will on the game, and more about building towards success 
on a higher level. 
</p>

<p>In the short term, the results might not be good. The youth coaches hired 
would have to be given contractual security and high enough pay to make it clear 
that results are not as important as developing players. For players, an 
education and a life beyond soccer should not be left out. In the longer term, 
the benefits of smarter, more technical players and coaches seems evident. 
</p>

<p>In the unique, top-down world of American soccer, it would be nice if such an 
initiative could be spearheaded by the US National Team coaches and the US 
Soccer Federation President. As a spur to a discussion of the issue, at least, 
they could do worse than read Vialli and Marcotti's fine book.

				<p>By Tony Edwards 
</p>

<p>USSoccerPlayers (February 5, 2007) -- Since the San Jose Earthquakes upped 
and moved to Houston in late 2005, Bay Area Major League Soccer fans have had 
little to sustain them besides memories, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daIomlBZvIM">old action clips on 
YouTube</a>, and watching former Quakes play for the US National Team. 
</p>

<p>Thinking about the team's entirely preventable move to Texas, and the 
twice-christened Dynamo's subsequent MLS Cup success, has served to sharpened 
the pain when, back in Northern California, various supposed champions of Bay 
Area MLS soccer emerged to raise hopes of a re-birth, only then to disappear 
again. Some proved to be lacking the financial resources. Some have had time to 
make a deal, but lacked the desire. 
</p>

<p>Now, however, Oakland Athletics owner and real estate magnate Lewis Wolff has 
stepped forward as the Quakes' likeliest redeemer. His organization, Earthquakes 
Soccer LLC, purchased an exclusive window to bring MLS soccer back to the Bay 
Area, and opened an office in Wolff's San Jose Fairmount Hotel. Then, last week, 
news surfaced that Wolff and San Jose State University are close to a deal that 
would see him pay for a new stadium on the campus of SJSU, to house both Quakes 
Mark 2 and the college's gridiron team. 
</p>

<p>Another significant player in the region has been Soccer Silicon Valley, a 
grouping of fans, players, business leaders and political leaders long involved 
in the campaign to keep MLS in the Bay Area. It has been a model organization in 
helping to facilitate both public and behind-the-scenes activities and 
negotiations. 
</p>

<p>SSV's Vice President, Jay Hipps, told USSoccerPlayers that his body has no 
comment on negotiations between Earthquakes Soccer and any other possible 
partners, but did say that he feels Wolff is different from previous &quot;champions&quot; 
who have stepped up and then quickly back down. 
</p>

<p>&quot;As for what's different, the list is long,&quot; Hipps said in an email 
interview. &quot;Lew Wolff has negotiated an option for a new team with MLS, hired a 
very capable and professional staff, opened new offices for the venture, and is 
sponsoring (along with SUM and MLS) a friendly between Mexico and Ecuador at the 
McAfee Coliseum in Oakland at the end of March. It's an exponentially greater 
level of commitment than we've seen from anyone else.&quot; 
</p>

<p>Such commitment has been absent from past potential investors, and even from 
those who operated the Quakes. As well intentioned as people like former 
Clash/Quakes GMs Peter Bridgwater, Lynne Meterperel and John Moore were, they 
lacked the organizational support and commitment to accomplish their goal: a 
vibrant, successful, profitable franchise. 
</p>

<p>Hipps said that having someone as successful and experienced as Wolff step up 
gives some degree of confirmation to everything SSV, and Bay Area Quake fans, 
have been saying all along about soccer's huge potential in the region. 
</p>

<p>&quot;The fact that Lew Wolff sees the same potential in this market that we see, 
that he believes the way we believe,&quot; said Hipps, &quot;really validates everything 
that SSV has done over that time, from meeting with area politicians to seeking 
out local investors.&quot; Hipps points to the appointment of David Alioto as the top 
man with the new Earthquakes organization: &quot;Alioto left a great job with the 
Oakland A's to do this. Why? Because he enjoys soccer.&quot; 
</p>

<p>It should also be noted that Alioto's position with the A's has now been 
filled, so there is no easy way back for him. 
</p>

<p>For all the current optimism, there will be no quick fix. Even if a franchise 
is awarded and starts playing in 2008, fans in one of the largest media markets 
in the country will have to make do with indoor and semi-pro soccer in 2007. If 
MLS returns, it may prove difficult to lure back old fans to an expansion team 
not coached by Dominic Kinnear, and without Brian Ching leading the front line. 
</p>

<p>Yet, as Hipps concluded, this gap in the area's pro soccer calendar may prove 
to be a worthwhile sacrifice. 
</p>

<p>&quot;If the price we have to pay to get them involved as owners, with a new 
stadium, is going for a couple years without the Earthquakes,&quot; he said, &quot;I think 
in the long run we will have achieved something beyond our best hopes.&quot;

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>USSoccerPlayers.com (Jan. 10, 2006) -- We all know the old saw about how to 
make a small fortune in American soccer ... start with a large one. And we know 
about the difficulties of making it in the United Soccer Leagues, financial and 
otherwise. 
</p>

<p>Yet, Tom Simpson is bringing the San Francisco Seals back. After a 
multiple-year interruption, the franchise returns to San Francisco and the East 
Bay as a PDL participant, armed with a unique plan for stability. 
</p>

<p>After seeing how the Earthquakes experiment concluded, it's fair to ask why 
anyone would be interested in getting into the market. Simpson was kind enough 
to sit for a long e-mail interview that stretched over a couple of weeks that 
included why the Seals are coming back and how a PDL team can keep its financial 
head in the game. 
</p>

<p><strong>Tony Edwards</strong>: Tom, as you are listed as the General Manager and Head 
Coach, let's start with the obvious question first: What motivated you to bring 
the Seals back? 
</p>

<p><strong>Tom Simpson</strong>: There were a number of developments that led to the 
rebirth of Seals soccer in the San Francisco Bay Area. Prior to those 
developments, I would say that it wasn't an idea I would have entertained. 
</p>

<p>It started about a year ago when I was asked by some youth groups to help 
them establish a Y League franchise. They had tried on their own but because of 
some management issues it looked like the whole thing was going to fall apart. I 
called the USL on part of the group and renegotiated some conditions for them. 
One condition required by the USL was that I manage the Y League franchise. I 
agreed to that condition because I believe the time is right to bring back high 
functioning youth soccer to San Francisco. The Y League franchise is called San 
Francisco United Soccer Club. 
</p>

<p>The USL put another condition on our entrance in the Y League: they wanted me 
to look into bringing a PDL franchise into the league to compliment the youth 
program. I didn't immediately agree to this. 
</p>

<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: Why not? 
</p>

<p><strong>Simpson</strong>: I told the USL that I would investigate that possibility. I 
spend a few months talking to key people at local universities. I was pleasantly 
surprised to find that the colleges, in general, were more accommodating than in 
the past. The main reason for this is that the PDL is now a favored summer time 
training opportunity for their college players. 
</p>

<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: Who else did you speak with? 
</p>

<p><strong>Simpson</strong>: I also talked to a number of youth groups in the area, who 
pledged support. With that I told the USL that the situation seemed favorable 
for the consideration of placing a franchise here. If they were to reactivate 
the Seals franchise I would make a go at it. However, the USL wasn't willing to 
reactivate without a franchise fee and I told them the deal was off and left the 
idea. 
</p>

<p>Within a month of my decision to not go forward, the owner of the Nevada 
Wonders (Randy Roser) contacted me. He expressed an interest in moving his PDL 
franchise to San Francisco and didn't want anything other than to retain some 
ownership. We negotiated a relationship that involved a 60 percent ownership by 
Randy Roser and a 40 percent ownership by the San Francisco Soccer Development 
Corporation, the corporate owner of the San Francisco Bay Seals. Randy Roser 
gave 100 percent management of the franchise to us and we changed the name to 
the San Francisco Seals. 
</p>

<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: Quite a road just to get this far. But once you started 
investigating the possibility, what was your motivation? 
</p>

<p><strong>Simpson</strong>: The real motive is this: we are interested in creating a 
business model for a soccer franchise in the United States that works. The 
franchise must be self-sustaining and have the capability of growing with 1) the 
community's willingness to support the game and 2) the ever-increasing numbers 
of high functioning soccer players. 
</p>

<p>It is our observation that the entertainment value of soccer in the United 
States is insufficient to support a franchise at any level, with very few 
exceptions that have unique features that apply only to the exception. 
Franchises should stay within the limits of their support, yet owners have 
consistently violated this principle for two reasons: 1) competitive ambition 
and 2) unrealistic expectations on part of the community. 
</p>

<p>We believe the successful model will require a strong youth base (i.e. SFUSC) 
and will develop alternative sources of revenue that do not rely on the fan base 
and sponsorship for revenue. American soccer players have grown in stature and 
numbers in the international market place and European clubs are showing a 
growing interest in American talent. We see the transfer market as the emerging 
opportunity for revenue generation. Randy Roser, while the franchise was in 
Nevada, had some success in the international transfer market. We're going to 
try to expand what he started. While we are working to grow the pipelines for 
transfer and discovery fees, we will collect traditional revenues from ticket 
sales, merchandizing, sponsorships and camps. We are currently seeking investors 
who believe enough in soccer to try our model. 
</p>

<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: Fascinating answer. Let me follow up. A good 10-plus years 
ago in his wonderful book, <em>The Grass of Another Country</em>, writer 
Christopher Merrill interviewed the then-owner of the New Mexico Chiles in May 
of their first season. The gist of this owner's quote was &quot;I see things in 
decades and I plan to be around with the Chiles for at least a decade.&quot; 
</p>

<p>They were, of course, out of business by Christmas of that same year, victim 
to many of the enthusiasms/problems you list below. So this is clearly not a new 
problem. When is it realistic to think that the revenue model you are promoting 
might begin to see some positive feedback (not profitability initially)? 
</p>

<p><strong>Simpson</strong>: Here's my best guess (based on our past experience): By our 
final year (1999), the Seals generated revenues of $300,000 (about 1/3 of the 
average expenses of an A-League for that year). We spent $360,000 that year. 
</p>

<p>When we sold the franchise for $100,000 we were able to collect enough to pay 
off our debts and break even for the year. However, [the buyers] never finished 
paying us and went bankrupt: hence, I've reclaimed the name. 
</p>

<p>The PDL expenses are going to be at least $50,000 per year. I'm pretty 
careful about expenses so we're limiting our budget to $50,000 for this year 
with a maximum increase of 10 percent per year for the next three years. Other 
PDL teams are rumored to be running operations for $100K to $250K, but I haven't 
verified those figures. We will do everything we can to keep our expenses below 
$100K by the time we reach maturity, which I expect to require up to five years. 
If we can generate even half of the revenues we generated in our last year of 
operations in 1999, we will be ahead of the game. My business plan is to be 
revenue neutral within three years and reach revenues of at least $150,000 
within 5 years. 
</p>

<p>The Seals may not be the one who pulls this off [proves this plan is 
workable], but someone will. It's inevitable. 
</p>

<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: And how does the Earthquakes situation affect yours [asked 
before AEG pulled them out of San Jose]? 
</p>

<p><strong>Simpson</strong>: People can argue all they want about why soccer franchises 
fail. The bottom line is this: it's not worth watching! How do I know? The fans 
tell us at the turn-style. 
</p>

<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: Can you expand on that? 
</p>

<p><strong>Simpson</strong>: I don't want to come off as blaming the fans or the players 
in any way, they aren't the problem. But the problem is that it's heartbreaking 
to hear the truth about what's happening in soccer in the United States. When I 
say &quot;soccer is not worth watching&quot; I mean it very literally: people will not pay 
enough to support the game at the level the owners, players and fans would like 
to see it played i.e. great players, great venues, big time TV, high profile 
games, etc ... 
</p>

<p>The bottom line is this: Americans will not pay to watch MLS to the level 
that MLS can pay their bills. It's a shame, but the fans don't own this shame. 
It's the shame of the business people who create plans that don't work. It's not 
the fan's fault that American soccer falls so flat on its face, so often, so 
convincingly, and so disappointingly, the fault lies with those who have 
miscalculated what the American fan is willing to support. When I say that 
&quot;soccer is not worth watching&quot; I'm putting the brutal truth out there with the 
fewest words needed. If it's too brutal and my words are misinterpreted to mean 
that I don't believe in the fan who does support soccer, then I have made a 
major faux paux. 
</p>

<p><strong>Edwards</strong>: How are the Seals going to be different? 
</p>

<p><strong>Simpson</strong>: The Seals are a totally different business model than the 
Earthquakes. Ours is bottom up, theirs is top down. We are determined to not 
spend above our means. We will not spend above what the community will support. 
If we get 250 fans per game and bring in $10,000 for the season, then that 
income defines our budget. If we can add to that through merchandizing, camps, 
and through the capturing of player transfer fees and discovery fees, then that 
income permits an increase to our budget. Our players come from our youth 
programs, local men's teams, and the local colleges. The Earthquakes players 
come from wherever they can get them. 
</p>

<p>In spite of this, I continue to hope that the top-down Earthquake style model 
does work because what is good for the Earthquakes, in the end, is good for 
soccer. It's just that, for now, I don't believe in the model, and I worry that 
one more failure in the model makes it that much tougher for us who are slugging 
it out at the grass roots level.

				<p><strong>Forza Italia</strong><br />Paddy Agnew<br />Ebury Press, London, 
2006<br /><em>Available online</em> 
</p>

<p>By Tony Edwards 
</p>

<p>USSoccerPlayers (January 1, 2007) -- Is it a coincidence that many of the 
best writers on soccer are newspaper columnists? Simon Kuper, Sid Lowe, and 
Paddy Agnew all fit the bill. Along with Simon Kuper's fine books, Paddy Agnew 
joins the short list with his work, <em>Forza Italia</em>. 
</p>

<p>Nothing like beginning a review with a cliché, but Paddy Agnew really is some 
one you wouldn't mind sitting next to on the train or on the plane. 
</p>

<p>Want to talk about soccer? He's been covering the game for years. Politics? 
He's lived in and written about Italy and Italian politics for years. Religion? 
He's been the Irish Times' Vatican correspondent. 
</p>

<p>It's also a cliché to say that as a reviewer, particularly in a World Cup 
year, I've been sent a lot of 'history of the World Cup' books. I'm your man if 
you have questions about who scored in the first World Cup or the name of the 
manager who led Italy to success in 1934 and 1938. But, when a book as well 
reviewed and interesting as Agnew's comes along, it's a pleasure. 
</p>

<p><em>Forza Italia</em> is an eminently readable, yet appropriately serious, 
overview of life, soccer, and politics in Italy. Appropriately serious because 
Agnew isn't afraid to detail, for instance, the Juventus drug scandal (which is 
still shocking in the disregard for the players' long-term health, the sheer 
amount of drugs present in the Juve training center, and the plausible 
deniability enacted by the club's then-leadership), or to examine Silvio 
Berlusconi's rise to power on the back of his AC Milan's success. Even these 
matters, though, have Agnew's deft touch. 
</p>

<p>Agnew demonstrates the newspaper reporter/columnist's ability to present the 
information and allow the facts to speak for themselves, without overtly 
injecting himself into those stories. Another way of saying that might be that 
Agnew treats his readers like adults. 
</p>

<p>What about the eminently readable part? As every review of this book has 
noted, it's not all soccer. Some of the book is dedicated to Agnew's story of 
his life in Italy, with all the joys and all the difficulties. This is no Peter 
Mayle making Provence seem like the most perfect place on Earth. 
</p>

<p>Agnew's approach places soccer in its place in the framework of life in 
Italy. Agnew weaves his book with that knowledge, not divorcing sport from 
business from religion from life. 
</p>

<p>As <em>Forza Italia</em> is an overview, there are aspects that are going to 
disappoint. Would more on, say, Inter and a little less on Napoli and Maradona 
have hurt? Maybe, but I still found Agnew's experiences with the Maradona 
phenomenon and disgrace fascinating. The blind eye everyone turned to Maradona's 
'lifestyle and friends' brings no credit to anyone, in the end. 
</p>

<p>If you're looking for exhaustive review of Serie A, go someplace else. If you 
want to have a better idea of what soccer and life in Italy are like, start 
here.

				<p>USSoccerPlayers (November 13, 2006) -- Onstad. De Rosario. Davis. Barrett. 
Gray. Robinson. Waibel. Ching. 
</p>

<p>Pretty good team. Worthy champions. 
</p>

<p>My reaction upon first seeing them Sunday afternoon in the MLS Cup against 
New England was: &quot;Why do so many of them have beards?&quot; 
</p>

<p>Perhaps my level of involvement in Major League Soccer this season differed 
significantly from the previous 10 seasons. Differed to the extent that I 
wondered why players who used to play for the team I rooted for had made such 
terrible facial hair decisions instead of watching them all summer. 
</p>

<p>I watched approximately 65 total minutes of MLS action this past season. 
About 40 of those came during the second game of the D.C. United-New York Red 
Bulls series (which pleasantly surprised me) and the last 20 minutes (including 
penalty kicks) of Sunday's MLS Cup. As I said to my wife on Sunday morning, were 
this any other year, I'd have a significant schedule problem, as we had a 
neighbor's birthday party to attend at the same time as MLS Cup. This year, 
however, I had a great time at the party, talking with the other adults and 
playing soccer with the kids, and I didn't think about MLS Cup at all until we 
got home. 
</p>

<p>After we got home, however, I was curious. And while I wasn't upset when 
Houston won, it was like watching a Cup final from someplace else. I can 
appreciate what it means to the players, the coaches, and the (impressive number 
of) Houston fans, but still, it's not my team. It's not even my league. 
</p>

<p>Look, I understand why what happened here in the Bay Area happened. Even when 
the &quot;real&quot; attendance figures came out and gave credence to AEG's contention 
that attendance was a reason for moving the franchise, the words &quot;local 
ownership&quot; never appeared next to &quot;MLS San Jose team.&quot; I have as many doubts as 
the next guy about focusing on real estate, or David Beckham, as opposed to real 
quality of play, or even paying the players and staff legitimate wages, but it 
would be wrong to say that MLS isn't in a mostly better situation financially 
than they were four or five years ago. To say the house is totally in order and 
things are sky blue, however, is pure fantasy. What's the name of the 
soccer-specific stadium Houston plays in? Exactly. And while I think there's a 
chance Lewis Wolf's new Quakes may open his soccer-specific stadium before AEG's 
relocated franchise opens theirs, MLS is doing some things right: a Reserve 
League; the youth development plan; expanding to Toronto; and a team not wearing 
a primary color. 
</p>

<p>It's been a year. I can appreciate Dominic Kinnear even more for the job he's 
done in two cities under estremely difficult circumstances. I hope he gets the 
US National Team job at some point. 
</p>

<p>My oldest son still wants to play for the Quakes, but he's willing to play 
for the Galaxy if the chance arises.  
Landon Donovan is still his favorite player. For me, if/when Mr. Wolf gets a stadium deal done 
here in the Bay Area, I'll pull my Quakes stuff out of storage. 
</p>

<p>Until then, congratulations to Houston, but MLS is just someplace else.

				<title><p>USNSTPA - Article</p></title><p>By Tony Edwards 
</p>

<p>USSoccerPlayers (Jan. 12, 2006) -- In Patrick Barclay's engaging and 
well-written study, he mentions how, during the 2004-05 season, a British 
newspaper ran a &quot;fantasy stock market&quot; game where participants could &quot;purchase&quot; 
soccer personalities at values determined by the number of column inches devoted 
to them. 
</p>

<p>So, who won? David Beckham, right? Becks and Posh, Real Madrid constantly in 
crisis, no question, right? 
</p>

<p>Nope. 
</p>

<p>Frank Lampard then. Great midfielder for Chelsea and England. Dynamic and 
never injured. Scores goals, creates goals, plays defense. 
</p>

<p>No. 
</p>

<p>Thierry Henry? The best player on a team coming off an unbeaten season? 
</p>

<p>No. 
</p>

<p>Obviously, the book would be about them if one of those gentlemen had been 
the winner. 
</p>

<p>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho molded Claudio Rainieri's players into a team 
that literally swept all in its path during the EPL season. And Chelsea shows no 
sign of let up, with a healthy 13-point lead over Manchester United through 21 
matches. 
</p>

<p>Mourinho's path to Chelsea is quite well known. He was raised in the game by 
his father, a goalkeeper and a coach, is fluent in many languages, experience as 
a school teacher, translator and assistant to Sir Bobby Robson and Louis van 
Gaal; and conqueror of all at FC Porto. 
</p>

<p>It would be a distinguished resume for anyone, much less someone not yet 45 
years old. 
</p>

<p>And yet, why the fascination? There is no question Mourinho is incredibly 
intelligent in all dimensions and applications of the word; he's a skilled team 
builder and tactician; and he's quick with a phrase. 
</p>

<p>Yet, one could probably easily apply all those descriptions to Arsene Wenger, 
Guud Hiddinck, Bruce Arena, and Fabio Capello. Yet, it's Mourinho who wins the 
Coach of the Year awards and it's his tactics -- and grey cashmere coat -- that 
are copied and commented on. 
</p>

<p>It's part of the larger cult of the coach, for lack of a better term. And 
it's not limited to Europe. How many books have Pat Riley and Phil Jackson 
written? How much does an NFL head coach get for making off-season speeches to 
business executives? Why is Bill Parcells so fawned over? Is there any who isn't 
sick of Larry Brown? Not his coaching, but the endless stories that accompany 
him. 
</p>

<p>There are many contributing factors in the growth of this cult. Increased 
media coverage; sport becoming bigger business; sportswriters perhaps finding it 
easier to identify with a coach as opposed to with players; the general aging of 
the media, if I'm a 45-year-old sports columnist for a major metropolitan 
newspaper, do you really connect with some 20-year-old who didn't go to college 
or with a coach around your age who can speak intelligently about a subject you 
are probably passionate about also? 
</p>

<p>Most of us learned at a very early age that we weren't going to have our name 
chanted by 20,000 people at Spartan Stadium after scoring a game-winning goal. 
But, we all can play Worldwide Soccer Manager or Hattrick. So how difficult can 
coaching be, right? You took Luton Town to the Champions League in WWSM, so 
obviously, you could do it. Except we can't. And of those who can, even fewer of 
them have consistent, sustained success. 
</p>

<p>As Barclay's study concludes, Mourinho is much more than the sum of his 
intelligence, experience, charm, petulant spats, and tactics. Barclay quickly 
recognizes that you can't pin down Mourinho as this or as that. Rather than 
trying to do so, Barclay builds his profile with compelling interviews with 
Mourinho's peers in coaching and his mentors. 
</p>

<p>It's this combination of interviews, analysis, and research that combines 
into more than the sum of its parts and makes this such a compelling, readable 
book.

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>By Tony Edwards - SAN JOSE, CA (Oct. 24, 2005) USSoccerPlayers - &quot;Maybe we should&#39;ve sat back.&quot;  Earthquakes goalie Pat Onstad said.</p>
<p>Onstad is referring to the situation after Ricardo Clark&#39;s goal in the 68th  minute brought the Quakes to within one goal of the Galaxy on Sunday in the  first game of the Western Conference semifinals.</p>
<p>Now, there is no question that San Jose coach Dominic Kinnear is MLS Coach of  the Year this season. His ability to get the most out of his teams has been well  illustrated both this and last season. His teams play smart, attractive,  possession-oriented soccer while not being afraid of hard work. In shorthand,  they play for the front of the jersey.</p>
<p>Even Sunday, when they came out lethargically, they clearly bounced back  after halftime and scored a deserved goal.</p>
<p>So, at 2-1 down, with the next game at Spartan (where the team is undefeated  this season) and the Quakes clearly not firing on many cylinders (you can count  on one hand the players who had even decent games on Sunday, and after Clark and  Mullan, there was a big drop off in quality), should Kinnear have given the team  10 minutes to see if they could get an equalizer, then shut up shop?</p>
<p>Kinnear and assistant John Doyle certainly had time to think about this  during the shoving match and lecture in the minutes after Clark&#39;s goal. The  options for instituting this strategy however, seem somewhat limited, unless the  Quakes were able to import Andrea Pirlo or Juan Sebastian Veron for the last 20  minutes.</p>
<p>Should Kinnear have taken off his only healthy forward, Brian Ching, and put  on Danny O&#39;Rourke (a rookie) as defensive midfielder? Should Mark Chung have  been moved centrally with Ricardo Clark dropping deeper and instructed to cut  out any through balls. Or do you bring on Ryan Cochrane as part of a five man  defensive line, with explicit instructions to, let&#39;s be honest here, do whatever  it takes short of injury or giving up a dangerous free kick, to stop Donovan?</p>
<p>While the Chung idea is intriguing, if you are willing to sacrifice some  width, obviously, what you want to avoid is the league&#39;s best player one on one  with your slowest defender. It&#39;s a fair question to ask why Donovan (very classy  in his post game comments) was so often 1v1 in key situations in the second  half. Say what you want to about the no call, Kelly Gray shouldn&#39;t be chasing  Donovan across the penalty box by himself.</p>
<p>But along with asking questions of Kinnear, what of the experienced players  on the field? Onstad, Robinson, Barrett, and Chung, to name four, may well have  been urging their teammates to slow down, to play simply, to not get caught out  in the back. If so, however, their pleas went unanswered. ESPN2 highlighted  Kinnear pointing to his temple and telling his team to play smart, to think. Did  the veterans do the same, especially after the shoving match?</p>
<p>Playoffs are such a small sample size that it&#39;s almost unfair to make  judgments about teams (says the Oakland Athletics&#39; fan) based on the results of  a short series. But the results aren&#39;t there yet for Kinnear (much like the  A&#39;s).</p>
<p>Last season, on a Quakes team ravaged with injuries and loss of players,  Kinnear handed the keys to Donovan and Ramiro Corrales in Game 1 against the  Wizards and the team responded with their best game of the season. Kinnear chose  to return to the regular 2004 starting lineup in game 2 and the Quakes were  played off the park, with Jack Jewsbury&#39;s goal ending their misery.</p>
<p>Now, down two goals, but coming home, with your most effective player  (DeRosario) limping off the field in Carson, Kinnear, and Doyle, need to quickly  find the right balance between getting goals quickly and often while allowing  any.</p>
<p>A while back in <em>Champions Magazine</em>, there was an interview with the  (then) Rosenborg coach. He said that the team with the system will beat the team  without one just about every time. The Quakes have the system, a savvy coach who  may have had an off-day like many of his players, and a loud Spartan stadium.  Will it be enough?</p>

				<p>SAN JOSE, CA (May 12, 2005) USSoccerPlayers - Long the trademark of the Dutch 
National Team, the 4-3-3 formation seems to be coming back into vogue as a 
reaction against the established 4-4-2. During one of the recent Champions 
League semi-finals, both PSV Eindhoven and AC Milan lined up in this formation. 
When Chelsea had Arjen Robben and Damien Duff healthy, Jose Mourinho would often 
use this tactic, with a central striker. Chivas USA is struggling with it, but 
as success breeds imitation, more teams may well be adapting tactics or 
personnel to play this formation. 
</p>

<p>To get a better sense of the advantages, and disadvantages of the 4-3-3, I 
solicited the opinions of Lawrence Fine, editor of the wonderfully useful youth 
coaching newsletter Fine Soccer (http://www.finesoccer.com). We corresponded in 
an email interview about the advantages of the formation and of the evolution of 
the game's tactics. 
</p>

<p>There is a general disclaimer that should be applied to any discussion about 
formations, in that no one should get too focused on it. As Fine said, &quot;Many 
coaches understand that formations are somewhat overrated as opposed to the 
importance of maintaining balance and good spacing at all times.&quot; 
</p>

<p><strong>Tony Edwards:</strong> What do you make of the recent higher profile of this 
formation? Is it an innovation or a reaction against the 4-4-2? 
</p>

<p><strong>Lawrence Fine:</strong> Soccer is a constantly evolving sport but sometimes it 
evolves back to where it once was. Gradually we see coaches going to more 
players upfront (just like there used to be) with the understanding of the 
importance of quick transition, field position, and numbers up situations. 
</p>

<p><strong>TE:</strong> What are the advantages versus a 4-4-2 or a 4-5-1? 
</p>

<p><strong>LF:</strong> One of the main advantages of the 4-3-3 is the ability to get 
consistent width in the attacking part of the field early on. With the 4-4-2, 
much of the width is provided by the outside midfielders and while there are 
many advantages to this, it somewhat limits the availability of the width early 
on. 
</p>

<p>The 4-3-3 frequently opens up the availability for attacking runs from the 
outside backs since in many cases, the three midfielders play in somewhat of a 
triangle more as three center midfielders than one outside midfielder and two 
outside midfielder. It also allows for an easy transition to a 4-5-1 from a 
defensive standpoint when necessary. 
</p>

<p>While the 4-4-2 allows for a lot of creative runs upfront, it's a bit slower 
for quick transition since you don't have the numbers upfront right away. 
</p>

<p><strong>TE:</strong> Right. And as compared to the 4-5-1? 
</p>

<p><strong>LF:</strong> There are a lot of similarities between the 4-3-3 and the 4-5-1. 
The 4-3-3 being a bit more offensive minded and easier for the quick transition. 

</p>

<p>The other advantage of the 4-3-3 is the ability to organize defensively 
upfront and force the play to one side as opposed to the other formations which 
are much more difficult to do this because of the lack of numbers upfront. There 
is no doubt that it's a formation geared toward transition but not just from the 
back forward but also defending upfront as well. 
</p>

<p><strong>TE:</strong> Does using this line-up necessarily show a commitment to attacking 
soccer? 
</p>

<p><strong>LF:</strong> I'm not sure it's just a commitment to attacking soccer but I 
think it's somewhat of a commitment to total soccer 
</p>

<p><strong>TE:</strong> What's necessary to make the 433 work? I'm not talking about for 
professional scale necessarily, but for a coach of a youth club team. What kind 
of players are you looking for? What should they focus on in practice? 
</p>

<p><strong>LF:</strong> You need outside backs with the willingness and ability to go 
forward. Also it's important to have forwards with the willingness and ability 
to defend. This formation is one that strongly encourages ¿total soccer.&quot; 
</p>

<p>The other thing that is vital is to have midfielders who truly understand 
balance and shape both offensively and defensively. When playing with three 
center midfielders they must make sure they balance out at all times. This 
requires excellent vision and communication. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>SAN JOSE, CA (February 10, 2005) USSoccerPlayers - Well, it's the day after the first game of the Hex, so of course I'm writing about something unrelated to World Cup qualifying. </p>

<p>As my esteemed colleague Kevin McGeehan pointed out, there are many things MLS can learn from clubs such as Real Madrid. But, there is even more to learn from Madrid's eternal rival, FC Barcelona. There are probably more, but here are five key points MLS should consider' </p>

<p>Regionalism works. One of the first items that comes to mind is about Barca IS Catalonia. The fact that the entire team isn't entirely composed of Catalans is secondary to the fact that the club represents Catalonia. </p>

<p>It takes time to build up, but why can't the Revolution represent New England in more than just name? Why can't the Quakes represent Northern California? In real terms, this means MLS should negotiate with the MLS Players' Union to encourage teams to choose local players for the new reserve teams. They should legally not only start youth teams, but also somehow maintain the rights to the players up to a certain age. In a league as young as MLS, local identification needs to be a key marketing point, especially for the youth soccer crowd. Also, we've seen that the NBA strategy of marketing stars only works as long as there are, oddly, marketable stars. Short of David Beckham playing for the Galaxy, MLS can't market stars, they need to market teams and experience. </p>

<p>Brazil and Holland. Having said that about regionalism, it's also okay to look elsewhere for inspiration, specifically to Brazil and Holland. When you think of Barca's most successful players and coaches, there is a long list from those two countries (Cruyff, Neeskens, Koeman, Romario, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, Deco, Michaels, Cruyff, van Gaal, Rijkaard, etc). MLS should be a league for American players, but for attacking, creative, technical soccer players, it would be nice to see some more Brazilians and some Dutch players. </p>

<p>Attacking soccer sells. How many times have you heard that Barca 'ground out a 1-0 victory.' Right, never. Attacking soccer is part of the mission statement, if you will, of FC Barcelona. </p>

<p>Sure, MLS fans will say, 'I'd rather win 1-0 than lose 4-3.' Fair enough, but in a regular season that means as little in a league that needs to draw fans. Excitement sells. Look, I admire Jose Mourinho's philosophy as much as anyone, but Chelsea dominates games playing his way. I want to see MLS teams playing thoughtful, attacking, possession soccer. No defensive 4-5-1s with ten men behind the ball, no subbing out the goalscorers right after they score to bring on another defender. One of the genius moves Frank Yallop regularly made was that when the Quakes were ahead, he never brought on a defender to replace an offensive player. He always brought on a midfielder or a forward. Why? Because pressure wins games. So much for playing style, what about image? </p>

<p>Clean shirts. Perhaps the most notable image of Barca is their shirt. What is on their shirt? A badge and a manufacturer logo. Does it say the team name? Is it a billboard for some mobile phone company? No, its clean, and clean shirts look better. </p>

<p>A rivalry helps. Finally and possibly most importantly, you can't talk about Barca without mentioning Real Madrid. Yes, a rivalry helps. Play up Quakes-Galaxy matches more. Make the Brimstone Cup a bigger deal. And rather than giving those fans who are trying to create a Rapids-Real Salt Lake rivalry grief, give them credit for doing something to stir up some passion during a mostly meaningless regular season. <em><br /><br />Tony Edwards is a regular contributor to Round not Oval. </em></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>SAN JOSE, CA (January 6, 2005) USSoccerPlayers - On a sunny Northern 
California Saturday, twelve 4, 5, and 6-year-olds gathered around their coach 
before the start of their last game of the season. 
</p>

<p>“Who are we?” I shouted. 
</p>

<p>“The Dragons!” they replied, mostly in unison. 
</p>

<p>I stole that pregame shout from Jose Mourinho, who asks his players that very 
question before every match. And while his players shout Chelsea, let’s see Mr. 
Mourinho deal with runny noses, untied shoes, and players asking if it was time 
for the goody bags yet. Yes, it can only mean I’ve finished my first season as 
coach of a U-6 team. 
</p>

<p>Going into my rookie year as coach, I thought I did a lot of preparation for 
our practices and for the season. I read books, ran a mini-academy, and talked 
with other coaches and my assistant. And there is no substitute for any of those 
things. Yet, with kids this age, I quickly discovered I needed to have some 
flexibility in my practice plan. Even after matching up players of similar 
skills (and fortunately my best players were sharers, not ball hogs), it boiled 
down to, ‘he pushed me’ or ‘coach, my shoe is untied.’ I found out that the main 
purpose is about helping the kids find the joy in the game. 
</p>

<p>I was determined to keep it as simple for the kids as possible. Which way are 
we going? What do you do when the ball goes out of bounds? They began to learn 
to dibble, to kick with the side of the foot, and to try not to bunch up too 
much. But mostly, they just wanted to have fun. 
</p>

<p>As we play 3v3 in this league and don’t keep score, it’s easy to measure the 
players’ enjoyment and progress. Some of the players are so full of enthusiasm 
that when they are playing, they can’t help but forget what they’ve learned at 
practice. Some of the players need gentle reminding from their parents not to 
pick the flowers. And some of the players really got it all together, from a 
combination of ability, practice, and their own determination to get better. 
</p>

<p>At press conferences and in news releases, you often hear Major League Soccer 
Commissioner Don Garber touting soccer, and MLS in particular, as the Game for 
the New America. Besides a dislike for unnecessary capital letters in press 
releases, if you looked at my team, full of Asian Americans, African-Americans, 
Hispanics, and Caucasians, a glib, feel-good, PR statement does take on some 
ring of truth. These kids aren’t just here because their parents want them to be 
here or for the halftime and post game snacks. They’re here to play. If we could 
have expanded our four 8-minute quarter games to an hour, they would still be 
asking for more. 
</p>

<p>Our final game of the season was a wonderful example of the commitment these 
kids and their parents showed all season. There was a terrible traffic backup on 
the main freeway leading to the field. Yet, 15 minutes before game time, right 
on schedule, the entire team was there, shirts tucked in, and doing our warm-up 
stretches. 
</p>

<p>It certainly goes beyond cliché to write that I learned more from these kids 
and their parents than they got from me. The parents didn’t have to work as hard 
as they did to get their kids to practices and to the games. They didn’t have to 
organize the party and the snack rotation. But they did it anyway and they were 
all supportive. 
</p>

<p>Kids at this age need some space to play soccer and have fun without some 
adult putting pressure on them. It’s my feeling that it’s easy to overload 
beginners. I’m not qualified to teach the finer points of any system, but I hope 
I helped them have fun and want to come back for the spring season. I know I 
can’t wait for it.

				<title><p>USNSTPA - Article</p></title><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. (April 20, 2004) </p>

<p><strong>Who are you?</strong> 
</p>

<p>Tony Edwards. I live in Northern California, in the East Bay, with my amazing 
and very understanding wife and two incredible sons, one who goes to school many 
days a week wearing a Donovan/Earthquakes t-shirt. I play in an over-30 coed rec 
league on the weekends. 
</p>

<p>Professionally, I'm the executive editor of BioMechanics, a sports medicine 
and rehabilitation publication for healthcare practitioners. 
</p>

<p><strong>Where would we know you from?</strong> 
</p>

<p>J has given me the opportunity to write the 'What We're Reading' column for 
Round not Oval since its revival. I've also contributed some columns, mostly 
concerning the Earthquakes, to RnO. 
</p>

<p><strong>What will you bringing to the site?</strong> 
</p>

<p>A deep appreciation and critical eye to all aspects of the game. I was 
walking over to the field to join my team a couple of weeks ago and stopped to 
watch the two teams that were in the middle of their game. Just the movements of 
the players and the ball, the gestures, the support between teammates, captured 
for me what it is I love about the game. Having said that, the business and 
media aspects of the game fascinate me and I hope to spend some time on those 
topics. And for someone with no graphic design skill, I'm interested in the 
visuals of the game. Uniforms, badges, fans, etc.

<p><strong>What's the best game you've ever seen?</strong> 
</p>

<p>Last November's Quakes-Galaxy first round game at Spartan Stadium in the 
playoffs where the Quakes came back from a 4-0 deficit. So much about that game 
remains fresh even now. I was privileged to be in the crowd that evening. 
</p>

<p><strong>What's your back story?</strong> 
</p>

<p>It started with the Cosmos. I remember watching them on cable and becoming 
totally obsessed with the game. I had a Beckenbauer poster on my wall. 
</p>

<p>Like Tobias, my high school, in gridiron-mad northeastern Pennsylvania, also 
didn't have a soccer team while I was there. A bunch of us would get together on 
the weekends to sneak onto the only local field that was available. I also 
played on a men's league team, although ‘played’ somehow does not manage to 
convey how baffling it all was to me. This teenaged American who had only 
started playing a couple of years ago and had no coaching or skill, to be out on 
the field, or even on the bench, with this crew of men from Europe, Central 
America, and South America. 
</p>

<p>Somehow, my Dad got us tickets for the Cosmos-Aztecs semi-final in 1980, I 
think it was, at Giants Stadium. I don't remember anything about the two hour 
drive down or back, but after we parked the car, I was overwhelmed by the 
smells, languages, colors, and passion, and this was in the parking lot! I 
couldn't believe this many other people felt the same way I did. The game was a 
blur, all I remember is the Cosmos won. 
</p>

<p>After high school, I went off to Villanova (yay Jim Curtin) where to say I 
played for the JV team my freshman year would be a great overstatement. I was 
underskilled, undertrained, and desperately out of sorts compared with my 
teammates, who could do amazing things with the ball. I did have one shot on 
goal late in a game after coming on as a substitute, of which I remain 
inordinately proud. 
</p>

<p>The Atoms were gone, the Fury was gone, the Fever were gone, so I didn't 
follow the game much after college. I went to journalism school at Temple 
University in Philadelphia, then got a job. I had the great fortune to meet the 
woman who has become my wife and we moved out to California a couple of years 
later. I didn't really start passionately following the game again until the WC 
qualifiers in 1996/97. And then WC '98 led me right into MLS and the Clash, 
which meant I spent a lot of time wondering why John Doyle always had to try to 
cover up for Mauricio Wright. It's an understatement to say that since 2001, the 
experience has been much more pleasurable, both club and country. 
</p>

<p>I've also started playing again, with indoors and moving back outdoors in a 
wonderful, friendly league. Good supportive teams, a great environment, and 
varied skill levels; everyone contributes and everyone is a part of the team. 
</p>

<p>Being a good parent, I've taken steps to infect my oldest son (he's 5 and 
just started playing at the local Y), who now constantly asks to play soccer 
with me in the backyard and who sits with me and watches games. He already knows 
the difference between the Earthquakes and the National Team, and he gives me 
'tips' before I go out to play on the weekends. </p>
