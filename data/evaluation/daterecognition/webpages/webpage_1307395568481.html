<p>Anton La Guardia, Diplomatic Editor &amp; David Rennie &nbsp;| Washington, DC | September 23, 2004</p><p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/23/wirq223.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/23/ixnewstop.html">Telegraph</a> - Just one sentence demonstrated yesterday where the real power lies in Baghdad: not with the internationally recognised "sovereign" Iraqi government, but with the American "embassy".</p><p>
Iraq's justice minister announced on Tuesday night that Rihab Taha, a woman scientist known as "Dr Germ", would be released from prison. The case of another scientist known as "Mrs Anthrax", Huda Ammash, was under discussion, he said.</p><p>American and British officials were caught by surprise, and feared that this would be seen as a concession to terrorists who had beheaded two American hostages and were threatening to murder a third, the British businessman Kenneth Bigley.</p><p>
Within a day, a US embassy spokesman in Baghdad set the record straight on Dr Germ and Mrs Anthrax: "Both of them are in the physical and legal custody of the multinational forces, there is no imminent release and these cases are constantly under review."</p><p>
In other words, the Americans were solely responsible for holding "high-value detainees" - the jailed members of Saddam Hussein's former regime - and only the Americans would decide whether any would be set free. It took several more hours for the Iraqi prime minister, Iyad Allawi, to surface in New York to re-establish his control. He said he would not negotiate with terrorists, declaring: "No release takes place unless I authorise it."</p><p>
The episode exposes the reality of Iraq, as opposed to the image of independence that the US seeks to project.</p><p>
The US has tried to withdraw its forces from the streets of Baghdad, leaving day-to-day patrolling in the hands of Iraq's embryonic security forces. But whenever there is an incident, it is American helicopters, Humvees and other armoured vehicles that arrive at the scene.</p><p>
For all the talk of large numbers of Iraqi soldiers being trained, it is US forces that carry the brunt of the fighting in major operations.</p><p>
Last June's handover to the Iraqi interim government was symbolised by the departure of Paul Bremer, the US proconsul who controlled every aspect of the Iraqi bureaucracy, and the arrival of John Negroponte as the new US ambassador.</p><p>
But thousands of US officials stayed in Baghdad's heavily protected "Green Zone". Mr Bremer's Coalition Provisional Authority headquarters, in one of Saddam's former palaces, was redesignated a US "embassy".</p><p>
US officials who were all-powerful "advisers" to Iraqi ministers under Mr Bremer have now become "consultants".</p><p>
Both sides claim that there has been a "real change" in the balance of power within the ministries, and that Iraqis now decide how to spend more than &#163;40 million a day in oil revenues.</p><p>
In contrast with the flamboyant Mr Bremer, Mr Negroponte has made a point of staying in the shadows. The question is the degree to which he has relinquished control.</p><p>
In a rare interview this week with The Washington Post, he resorted to an American football metaphor to explain the transformation.</p><p>
"When it comes to calling the plays on the field, especially on sensitive military operations, there's only one quarterback, and his name is Allawi. Obviously they need a lot of help, but we're working on reducing that reliance and building up their capacity."</p><p>
Still, America's best efforts to demonstrate that Dr Allawi is in charge are periodically undermined by its actions.</p><p>
Last week, for example, Mr Negroponte's office tried to stop the ABC television network from interviewing Dr Allawi during his stop in London, saying it should be delayed by a week.</p><p>
But when ABC let the White House know its irritation at a mere ambassador presuming to dictate the Iraqi prime minister's press schedule, Dr Allawi's interview was back on track.</p><p>
A top Pentagon commander, Lt Gen Walter Sharp, this week let slip that the handover of security control to local Iraqi forces is decided by the US commander and Mr Negroponte jointly "looking across all the sectors to determine whether or not an area is ready to go to local control".</p><p>
On major military operations, such as last month's three-week siege to evict Shia radicals from the Shrine of Ali in Najaf, the timing, pace and conclusion of the US action appears to have been strongly influenced by Dr Allawi's political calculations.</p><p>
But elsewhere it is American calculations that dominate. US forces are preparing to retake the Sunni town of Fallujah, which has become a no-go area for coalition forces. But the assault will almost certainly be delayed until after the US presidential election in November.</p><p>
Dr Allawi faces a dilemma in his relationship with America. Without the presence of US forces, he would be swept away within days; but for as long as US troops remain in Iraq, he cannot gain full legitimacy in the eyes of Iraqis.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Troops returning from Iraq to be offered radiation checks</p><p>
23.09.2004<br /><br />
1.00pm</p><p>
The 61 New Zealand defence engineers and tradespeople who spent time in Iraq will be offered medical checks if they think they were exposed to depleted uranium.</p><p>
The second defence contingent is due back in New Zealand on Saturday after two deployments which began in September last year.</p><p>
They were based in Basra where they helped rebuild schools, hospitals and health clinics, police stations, law courts, government buildings.</p><p>
The mixture of army, navy and air force tradesmen and women also helped restore power supplies, rebuilt bridges and provided humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.</p><p>
However, Defence Force spokeswoman, Commander Sandra McKie said in a statement today the returning soldiers would all be offered medical checks if they thought they were exposed to depleted uranium munitions.</p><p>
Depleted uranium is a heavy, slightly radioactive metal that is used in weapons and armour plating and results in an extremely hard metal which performs far better than other competing material.</p><p>
The American Defence Department (DOD) has said depleted uranium needs to be fired (as a munition) or "cooked off" in fires or explosions to be harmful to troops.</p><p>
Even then it posed an extremely low radiological threat provided it remained outside the body, said the American DOD.</p><p>
If it was taken into the body as metal fragments or dust-like particles, it may pose a long term health hazard if the amount was large.</p><p>
Cdr McKie said all troops being sent to areas where depleted uranium may have been used had been briefed on the potential risk.</p><p>
She said the deployment to Iraq cost $10 million but the troops were not there as part of the occupying force and were not involved in security operations.</p><p>
She said Iraq was still a difficult and challenging environment and there was a security risk to the New Zealand troops.</p><p>
"It was necessary for them to be able to protect themselves."</p><p>
The troops carried arms when they left their British camp base at Basra but if the threat level escalated they did not leave the base.</p><p>
The troops will be welcomed home by Prime Minister Helen Clark, Defence Minister Mark Burton, and Vice Chief of Defence Force, Air Vice Marshal David Bamfield at the Ohakea Air Force Base on Saturday night.</p><p>
It was highly unlikely New Zealand would send any more troops to Iraq because the country "is just too difficult and too dangerous," Miss Clark told National Radio yesterday.</p><p>
"We can see with the tragic recent hostage-takings and beheadings played on the internet that Iraq just isn't a place for civilians at the present time."</p><p>

    <div class="content"><p>DUBAI (AFP) - A group calling itself the "Jihad Organization" said it had "slaughtered" two Italian hostages in Iraq (news - web sites), in a statement posted on an Islamist website, but Italy urged caution over the reported murders.</p><p>
The purported execution of the two women, both aid workers abducted more than two weeks ago in Baghdad along with two Iraqi colleagues, caused consternation in Italy, with Italian TV and radio running special bulletins through the night.</p><p>
If confirmed the two would become the third and fourth hostages murdered in Iraq within three days, following the beheading of two US captives on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>
Early Thursday, a statement on an Islamist website said: "We in the Jihad Organization in Iraq announce that the ruling of God Almighty has been implemented on the two Italian prisoners by slaughter."</p><p>
Referring to Simona Pari and Simona Torretta without naming them, it said they were executed "after the Italian government, led by the despicable (Prime Minister Silvio) Berlusconi, did not heed our sole condition (for releasing them), which was to pull out of Iraq."</p><p>
The "Jihad Organization" vowed to "deliver blows to the Italian government, and to continue striking it and striking every foreigner residing in Iraq.</p><p>
"We will turn Iraq into a graveyard for you and for anyone who ventures to attack Muslims," the statement said.</p><p>
The claim by the "Jihad Organization" that the women had been "slaughtered" could not be immediately verified.</p><p>
Pari and Torretta, both 29 and aid workers for the organization "A Bridge to Baghdad" were abducted in Baghdad on September 7 along with two Iraqi colleagues. The statement did not mention the fate of the two Iraqis, a man and a woman.</p><p>
An Islamist group calling itself the Islamic Jihad Organization in Iraq subsequently demanded that staunch US ally Italy withdraw its 3,000 troops stationed in Iraq, or the two Italians would be killed.</p><p>
The statement Thursday was posted on a website seldom used to make such claims and was dated Wednesday.</p><p>
ANSA cited Italian intelligence services who said they believed the Internet site was not very reliable.</p><p>
The non-governmental organization "A Bridge to Baghdad" also reacted with caution. "We are trying to verify the authenticity" of the claim, the organization said in a statement on its website.</p><p>
"All of this ... brings the greatest doubts. We are waiting. The night will be without end," it said.</p><p>
The humanitarian organization Intersos, which one of the two abducted Iraqis was working for, also said the claim was unreliable.</p><p>
"Our sources in Baghdad do not consider... this announcement reliable," said Nino Sergi, the secretary general of the Rome-based organization.</p><p>
The reported execution comes after the beheading earlier this week of two US hostages in Iraq, Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, held by the Al-Qaeda linked group Tawhid wal Jihad (Unity and Holy War) and led by suspected Al-Qaeda number two Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi.</p><p>
That same group is also holding a British hostage, Kenneth Bigley, who on Wednesday issued an emotional plea for mercy via a video posted on an Islamist website.</p><p>
The Briton and the two murdered Americans were kidnapped together last week, and Zarqawi's group has demanded that all Iraqi women being held in jail in the country be release or Bigley will suffer the same fate as the two Americans.</p><p>
There have been no pictures or videos posted of the two women since their kidnapping, in contrast to the videotaped execution of the two US hostages, and the purported plea for his life from the British captive.</p><p>
On Wednesday, Italian press reports said the Italian secret service had made indirect contact with the women's kidnappers and believed they were alive.</p><p>
Last month, an Italian journalist working in Iraq was abducted by extremists and murdered several days later after Italy refused to bow to the demands to pull its soldiers out of the country.</p><p>

Top Shiite Cleric Is Said to Fear Voting in Iraq May Be Delayed<br /><br />
By DEXTER FILKINS</p><p>
BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 22 - Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani, the nation's most powerful Shiite leader, is growing increasingly concerned that nationwide elections could be delayed, his aides said, and has even threatened to withdraw his support for the elections unless changes are made to increase the representation of Shiites, according to one Iraqi source close to him.</p><p>
Aides to Ayatollah Sistani contacted Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria, the United Nations adviser who brokered the agreement to hold the elections, planned for January, to express concern that they would be delayed, according to Hamid Khaffaf, one of Ayatollah Sistani's top aides.</p><p>
Another source close to the electoral negotiations said Ayatollah Sistani had asked Mr. Brahimi to return to Iraq to try to address his concerns. Mr. Khaffaf declined to discuss details of the conversation.</p><p>
In New York, Mr. Brahimi's aides said only that he had not spoken recently to Ayatollah Sistani. The United Nations special representative to Iraq, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi of Pakistan, could not be reached for comment.</p><p>
According to people with knowledge of the talks, Ayatollah Sistani is concerned that the nascent democratic process here is falling under the control of a handful of the largest political parties, which cooperated with the American occupation and are comprised largely of exiles.</p><p>
In particular, these sources say, Ayatollah Sistani is worried about discussions now under way among those parties to form a single ticket for the elections, thus limiting the choices of voters and smothering smaller political parties.</p><p>
Ayatollah Sistani, who earlier this year sent tens of thousands of Iraqis into the streets to demand early elections, is said to be worried that a "consensus list" of candidates from the larger political parties would artificially limit the power of the Shiites, who form a majority in the country.</p><p>
Under an agreement reached among exile groups in the early 1990's, the Shiites were said to make up about 55 percent of the population. Ayatollah Sistani, the sources say, believes the Shiite population has swelled since then and therefore would be underrepresented on any list based on a 55 percent figure.</p><p>
Ayatollah Sistani also expressed concerns that the Iraqi government, possibly under American pressure, would postpone the elections on the pretext that the anarchical conditions that prevail over parts of the country would make the results illegitimate, the sources said.</p><p>
According to an Iraqi close to Ayatollah Sistani who spoke at length with him last weekend, the ayatollah is so upset about the prospect that the Shiites might be underrepresented that he is prepared to withdraw his support for the elections if his concerns are not addressed. It is unclear, however, what specific demands he has made.</p><p>
"If he sees that what this is leading to is unfair and unfree elections, then he will not take part in it,'' the Iraqi said. "He will declare the elections to be illegitimate."</p><p>
The activity by Ayatollah Sistani represents a reassertion of his efforts to ensure that the country's long-suppressed Shiite Arabs translate their majority status into political power. In the months since the Americans toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Sistani has largely stayed away from engaging in the minutiae of partisan politics, but he has aggressively pushed the Americans, the United Nations and the Iraqi government to hold democratic elections as soon as possible.</p><p>
The prospect of a boycott by Ayatollah Sistani could have severe consequences. The grand ayatollah, the senior cleric among the Shiite religious hierarchy, commands vast respect among ordinary Iraqis, many of whom could be counted on to give serious consideration to a pronouncement by him about the elections. An association of Sunni clerics has already announced that they will boycott the election.</p><p>
Ayatollah Sistani's concerns also reflect a certain ambivalence regarding the presence of foreign forces in the country and the influence of international organizations like the United Nations. In the months since the Americans toppled Mr. Hussein, Ayatollah Sistani has declared a wish to end the American presence, but he has not told Iraqis to oppose it aggressively.</p><p>
His concerns come at a time of growing uncertainty about the feasibility of holding elections here in January, with a guerrilla insurgency raging across much of Sunni-dominated areas north and west of Baghdad. Last week, Secretary General Kofi Annan said he doubted whether legitimate elections could be carried out in the current environment. Some United Nations officials in Baghdad, however, have said they believe elections can go forward.</p><p>
American commanders say they intend to bring many of the most restive areas, including Falluja, under control by the end of the year, by force if necessary.</p><p>
In recent weeks, the leaders of the major Iraqi parties have been negotiating the possibility of forming a unified ticket for the elections.</p><p>
Under the electoral system, drawn up by the United Nations, voters will select not individual candidates but lists, whose members will take a number of seats in the National Assembly roughly proportional to the shares of the votes their parties receive.</p><p>
While many Iraqi leaders envisioned that each party would put forward its own list for the election, the negotiations among the larger parties are driving at consolidating all of the candidates onto a single slate. Party leaders involved in the negotiations say such a ticket would be conducive to national unity in a time of great distress.</p><p>
"The goal is to have a united front,'' said Adil Abdul Mahdi, the Iraqi finance minister and a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a leading Shiite party. "We think that would be better for the unity of the country."</p><p>
It was unclear late Wednesday precisely what Ayatollah Sistani sought from Mr. Brahimi or others at the United Nations. Mr. Khaffaf declined to discuss what Ayatollah Sistani would like Mr. Brahimi to do, other than to say, "The most important thing now is to hold the election at the specified time.''</p><p>
As concerned as Ayatollah Sistani is about early elections, he appears to be equally worried that the democratic process may be usurped by the well-financed major parties, nearly all of which flourished in exile and cooperated with the American occupation. These parties include the Iraqi National Accord, which is headed by the prime minister, Ayad Allawi; the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, known as Sciri; the Dawa Party; the Iraqi National Congress; the Kurdish Democratic Party, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.</p><p>
Dawa and Sciri are Shiite-dominated political parties; the National Accord and the National Congress are of mixed religion and ethnicity.</p><p>
All six of these parties are dominated by exiles, and together they formed the core of the external opposition to Saddam Hussein. Each was represented on the Iraqi Governing Council, the American-approved advisory board that served during the 15 months of military occupation.</p><p>
"Ayatollah Sistani's concern is that the elections are being controlled and managed by the political parties that took part in the government,'' said the source close to Ayatollah Sistani.</p><p>
Similar complaints arose last month during the gathering that was called to choose a National Conference, which is now advising the government. </p><p>

Insurgents Who Beheaded 2 Show Briton in Plea for Life<br /><br />
By EDWARD WONG</p><p>
BAGHDAD, Iraq, Thursday, Sept. 23 - A militant group that beheaded two American engineers this week posted a video on the Internet early Thursday showing a third hostage, Kenneth Bigley, a Briton, pleading for his life.</p><p>
The 11-minute video shows Mr. Bigley sitting in an orange jumpsuit in front of a black banner identifying the group, One God and Jihad, led by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The group had said in an Internet message on a different Web site that it would kill Mr. Bigley unless American-led forces in Iraq freed all women being held prisoner.</p><p>
In the video, Mr. Bigley states his name and hometown, Liverpool, before voicing a plea to Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair.</p><p>
"I need you to be compassionate as you always said you were and help me, help me to live," he says. "I don't want to die. I don't deserve that."</p><p>
"Please, please, please release the female prisoners that are held in Iraqi prisons," he continues. "Please help them."</p><p>
Several times, he breaks down into convulsions of sobbing.</p><p>
Mr. Bigley was kidnapped last week along with the two Americans, Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley, from a house in an upscale neighborhood of Baghdad.</p><p>
News agencies reported early Thursday that a posting on an Internet site rarely used by militants said the Jihad organization had killed two Italian aid workers kidnapped from their Baghdad home on Sept. 7. The message said the two 29-year-old women, Simona Pari and Simona Toretta, had been killed because the Italian government had refused to withdraw its troops from Iraq. The claim could not be independently verified, and the Italian government said it had no confirmation of the slayings.</p><p>
Mr. Zarqawi's group beheaded Mr. Armstrong on Monday and Mr. Hensley on Tuesday when their 48-hour deadline to free imprisoned women was not met. American soldiers recovered the body of Mr. Hensley on Wednesday morning in western Baghdad, a United States Embassy official said, and a grisly video of his beheading appeared early Thursday on the Internet.</p><p>
Throughout this latest hostage crisis, the American military has said it is holding only two women: Rihab Rashid Taha, a scientist known as Dr. Germ for her work on an anthrax program, and Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, a biotech researcher known as Mrs. Anthrax.</p><p>
A senior military officer said on Wednesday that a review board of the multinational forces had recommended two weeks ago that Ms. Taha be released, along with 13 other prominent security prisoners. Those cases were then turned over to the Iraqi government, which recently approved the board's decision, the officer said. The prisoners are awaiting final word from the office of Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top American commander in Iraq, he added.</p><p>
Ms. Taha and the other 13 prisoners will probably be released within a couple of weeks, the officer said.</p><p>
As for Ms. Ammash, the Iraqi government asked before the hostages were taken that she be freed on humanitarian grounds, he said. She will have to go through the entire review process, he said, and the final arbiter in her case will be the Defense Department rather than General Casey's office, because she is among the 55 Iraqis on the Pentagon's "deck of cards" most-wanted list.</p><p>
American and Iraqi officials did not disclose that Ms. Taha was close to being released - and that the review process might start soon for Ms. Ammash - until questioned by journalists on Wednesday. This in turn raised the question of why they did not disclose earlier the probable impending release of Mrs. Taha on the chance that such an announcement might prompt Mr. Zarqawi to show mercy to his hostages.</p><p>
The American, British and Iraqi governments have said they will not negotiate with militants and are fearful of appearing to compromise with such groups. On Wednesday, officials repeatedly said Ms. Taha's probable future release was not connected in any way to Mr. Zarqawi's demands.</p><p>
"No negotiations or deals will be taken with the terrorists," Kassim Daoud, the Iraqi national security adviser, said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference.</p><p>
Prime Minister Ayad Allawi told The Associated Press in a phone interview from New York that "no release takes place unless I authorize it." But in the case of Ms. Taha, the Iraqi government has already approved her release, and General Casey's office now has the final say.</p><p>
Violence continued to surge in the capital as two suicide car bombs exploded here. The first bomb detonated at about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday in western Baghdad, on a street corner where recruits for the Iraqi National Guard had gathered; at least 11 people were killed and scores more wounded, hospital and police officials said. The bomb went off after officials at the recruiting center told the young job-seekers to move away from the compound for fear someone would try to bomb the area. The men then gathered around a nearby ice cream shop and photocopy store.</p><p>
"My friends and I were eating breakfast there, and I said, 'Let's go have tea,' " said Enkido Asar, a 24-year-old recruit. "They said, 'No, we'll stay here.' I walked to the other side of the street and saw the car drive over the sidewalk and explode."</p><p>
More than 10 cars in the area were incinerated, and metal scraps and human flesh were scattered across the roadway. Men and boys raced around gathering the flesh and putting it into a small, makeshift dirt hole they had dug in the median.</p><p>
Insurgents had tried driving a car bomb up to the same recruiting center on Tuesday, but American soldiers defused it after the driver fled.</p><p>
The second car bomb exploded Wednesday afternoon in the affluent neighborhood of Mansour, the same area where the three men being held by One God and Jihad lived and where Mr. Armstrong's body was dumped on Monday. Five American soldiers on patrol were wounded, and one of them died later at a medical center, the military said.</p><p>
A soldier in the northern city of Mosul died of wounds after an ambush by insurgents. A soldier in Tikrit was killed by a roadside bomb. At least 1,040 American soldiers have died since the start of the war.</p><p>
For the last 10 days, insurgents have been pressing a deadly campaign against the American occupation and the interim government, sending out wave after wave of suicide car bombs and killing hundreds of Iraqis, many of them young men trying to sign up for the nascent Iraqi security forces.</p><p>
The American military said Wednesday that it had charged two soldiers based in Baghdad, Sgt. Michael P. Williams and Specialist Brent W. May, with the murder of three Iraqis.</p><p>
On Tuesday night, American forces battled militiamen loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American Shiite cleric, in the Baghdad slum of Sadr City. Witnesses described the fighting as intense, with American helicopters firing into the slum. By noon Wednesday, the soldiers had left the area. The Associated Press reported that at least 10 Iraqis had been killed and 92 wounded.</p><p>
The A.P. also reported that an American airstrike in Baghdad on Friday killed Sheik Abu Anas al-Shami, the spiritual leader of One God and Jihad. The report quoted Sheik Shami's family and clerics living in Jordan, where the sheik had citizenship. Jordanian and American officials did not confirm the killing.</p><p>

Iraqis Hail Tikrit Bridge Repair But Decry Pace of Reconstruction</p><p>
By Jackie Spinner<br /><br />
Washington Post Staff Writer<br /><br />
Thursday, September 23, 2004; Page A01</p><p>
TIKRIT, Iraq, Sept. 22 -- The Americans spared few expenses on ceremony Wednesday: Balloons soared over the Tigris River, a U.S. Army band pumped out the Iraqi national anthem, and red, white and black ribbon -- representing the colors of the Iraqi flag -- stretched across the newly repaired Tikrit Bridge.</p><p>
Tribal sheiks in traditional robes and municipal officials in dark Western suits lined up to march across the bridge to formally mark the completion of the $5.4 million, U.S.-funded project.</p><p>
An Iraqi police car began slowly leading the procession toward a group of waiting Americans -- troops from the 1st Infantry Division and representatives of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and its main contractor in Iraq, Bechtel. As the marchers progressed, a soldier hastily took down the red ribbon and stuffed it into his knapsack. An alert Iraqi had pointed out that it might not be the best idea for the governor of Tikrit to be seen cutting a representation of the Iraqi flag with an oversized pair of scissors.</p><p>
So it went on the day that the Tikrit Bridge reopened, 18 months after U.S. warplanes bombed it in order to cut a crucial transportation link between the cities of Tikrit and Kirkuk, the oil center of northern Iraq 70 miles to the north.</p><p>
The two-lane span is the third war-damaged bridge that USAID has restored and reopened. The U.S. government development agency has surveyed 40 others but has no immediate plans to fix them, citing a Bush administration decision to shift some money away from public works and reconstruction to security programs in an effort to deal with an unrelenting insurgency.</p><p>
The pace of reconstruction has left many Iraqis and their new leaders dissatisfied; the work continues, but at a pace that they consider disappointing.</p><p>
"We need more projects," Hamad Humood Shaqti, the governor of Tikrit, said even as he expressed pleasure at the reopening of the bridge. "We need more bridges, more hospitals. We need sewage systems in every village and town in the city."</p><p>
The Bush administration asked Congress this month for permission to divert $3.5 billion from public works and other long-term rebuilding projects to security needs, including the training and equipping of additional Iraqi police. Part of the reallocated money would go toward addressing unemployment, planning elections and repairing facilities for oil production, the nation's single most important source of revenue.</p><p>
At the bridge ceremony on Wednesday, James Stephenson, the USAID director in Iraq, said his agency would actually get a boost from the reallocation, which he said was not yet finalized.</p><p>
Under the plan, USAID would get $755 million to spend on economic policy reform, private sector development and preparations for local and national elections scheduled for January, he said.</p><p>
The proposed reallocation "is really a change to recognize the reality we find on the ground," said Stephenson, who wore a navy blue sport coat over his beige bulletproof vest. "Infrastructure is simply a means. By itself, it is nothing."</p><p>
The reconstruction of the bridge, which spans the Tigris at the home town of deposed president Saddam Hussein, reflects many of the challenges of rebuilding Iraq, where harsh physical conditions and insurgent attacks can complicate even simple projects.</p><p>
The bridge had suffered major damage in two places, requiring replacement of six girders, its deck, guardrails and lights. And there was another problem, said Terry Valenzano, Iraq program director for Bechtel National Inc., the San Francisco-based contractor for USAID. "We couldn't find the original plans," he said, a white hard hat perched on his head.</p><p>
Work started 11 months ago and initially progressed without major disruption. Insurgents at the time were targeting U.S. troops and their Iraqi allies. They largely left U.S. reconstruction companies alone and were not targeting Iraqi laborers.</p><p>
The new beams had to be cast in special molds and then trucked from Irbil in northern Iraq. Along the way, one of the trucks took a curve too fast, spilling one of the beams. It cracked. A replacement had to be made.</p><p>
This spring, the river rose to flood levels, washing over one of the piers and sweeping away some scaffolding.</p><p>
By then, insurgent attacks in the area had intensified. The U.S. military base next to the bridge was being hit by fire from mortars and other weapons.</p><p>
About a month ago, three employees of 77 Construction, the Kirkuk-based Iraqi subcontractor on the project, were ambushed and killed on their way to the work site, said Umit Talu, project manager for the company. A fourth worker was shot while working on the bridge.</p><p>
Over the weekend, Shaqti, Tikrit's governor, survived an apparent assassination attempt after his convoy came under fire, news agencies reported. On Wednesday, a U.S. soldier was killed by a roadside bomb three miles south of Tikrit.</p><p>
In spite of the difficulties, the bridge reopened, and Shaqti pledged that work and reconstruction would continue. "We are waiting for more promising projects in the future," he said in a speech delivered from the bridge.</p><p>
Local leaders who attended the ceremony soundly rejected U.S. plans to divert more reconstruction money into security. They said the Americans seemed to be missing the point.</p><p>
"This is a wrong idea," said Gen. Ahmed Jubouri, the Iraqi National Guard commander in Tikrit. "If we want to maintain security in this country, we have to spend more money on its infrastructure and economic sector, not take money."</p><p>
Abdullah Hussein Jabara, a deputy governor, said security had deteriorated because people didn't see improvement in their lives. "When there is poverty, there are crimes," he said. "These projects provide jobs to people. This is the best step we can take toward security improvement."</p><p>
As he strolled through crowd, fingering yellow prayer beads that hung from his black tribal dress, Abdul-Wahab Jubouri, the head of the Jubouri tribe in Tikrit, applauded the Americans for rebuilding the bridge, which he called "a historic event in the city."</p><p>
"We suffered so much before," he said. "Before, we had to wait for hours in lines to cross the only small bridge left after this one was bombed. This is the first step in a way to prosperity."</p><p>
As he spoke, he picked up one foot, then the other, to avoid standing too long in one place on the bridge's new tar, which had not quite sealed and was melting in the hot sun.</p><p>
He offered a piece of advice for the Americans: "Take the money for the security companies, give it to the jobless and people will achieve security."</p><p>
Samya Rahseed, chief engineer for roads and bridges in Tikrit, walked by wearing a long skirt, also picking her way carefully through the black muck. "This is not the way to pave our roads," she said, shaking her head. "We will survey this project and improve it. We will hire Iraqis. We will put them to work."</p><p>

    <div class="content"><p>Hostage throat-slitting videos rub shoulders with pornography in the stalls of central Baghdad's infamous "thieves market", as Islamic radicals immortalise their acts of terror in grisly films like Monday's beheading of a US national.</p><p>
The latest video, posted on Monday night on an Islamic website, showed five masked gunmen reading out their Islamic verdict against their American captive Eugene "Jack" Armstrong and then slicing off the victim's head as he cried out in pain.</p><p>
Once such gory videos are posted on the Internet it does not take long for them to make their way to the packed stalls of central Baghdad's Bab al-Sharqi marketplace where consumer appetite is hungry for bloody spectacle.</p><p>
In the teeming open-air market, television sets rigged to sound systems broadcast the sounds and sights of tortured hostages, belly dancers and pornographic movie stars.</p><p>
Shoppers can ask stallholders to play DVDs that catch their attention.</p><p>
Behind a plastic case, a dull picture of a local singer on the cover, are concealed the grisly exploits of the Tawhid wal Jihad (Unity and Holy War) group of alleged Al-Qaeda operative Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi.</p><p>
The telltale sign is a little white rectangular sticker on the sleeve, on which is written by hand in Arabic, "Al-Assifa" (storm).</p><p>

    <div class="content"><p>* US troops seal off Samarra*<br /><br />
by<br /><br />
Thursday 23 September 2004 7:59 AM GMT</p><p>
Iraqis look at a destroyed house following an air strike on the city</p><p>
US troops have sealed off the city of Samarra and called in air strikes, local officials say.</p><p>
"The Americans struck last night and three bodies were brought out from the wreckage," said police chief Colonel Muhammad Fadil on Thursday. </p><p>
Twenty-one cars were burnt or damaged in the air strikes, he added. US forces sealed off the city, including the crucial bridge over the Tigris.</p><p>
The US military confirmed fighting around Samarra on Wednesday evening when their troops were ambushed from a mosque. </p><p>
"A 1st Infantry Division patrol was attacked September 22 by anti-Iraqi forces with small arms fire and mortar fire from a mosque in Samarra at approximately 5pm (1300 GMT)," the military said, using its term for fighters. </p><p>
<strong>Under fire</strong></p><p>
The patrol also came under fire from a nearby building and<br /><br />
attack helicopters fired off missiles, but fighters continued to shoot at them. Finally aircraft dropped a bomb on the building, the military added. </p><p>
It was the latest in a string of incidents since US troops returned to the city on 9 September after a three-month absence, following a deal with local leaders. </p><p>
The agreement brokered by the Iraqi Government allowed US forces to patrol the city and start spending money on reconstruction projects in Samarra. </p><p>
It was viewed as taking Samarra away from the brink of a major US assault to reclaim it from fighters who had turned the city into a no-go zone for the Americans.</p><p>
<strong>Hostages' status</strong></p><p>
Meanwhile, Italian embassy officials in Baghdad could not confirm the authenticity of a statement on a website claiming that two Italian aid workers kidnapped two weeks ago had been killed. </p><p>
"We are evaluating the new statement. At the moment, we cannot say whether it is true or false," an official said on condition of anonymity. </p><p>
A group calling itself the Jihad Organisation said on Thursday in a statement on the internet that it had "slaughtered" the two hostages. </p><p>
The statement was posted on a website seldom used to make such claims. <br /><br />
Italian news agency ANSA said Italian intelligence services<br /><br />
believed the internet site which posted the execution claim was not very reliable.</p><p>
An armed group calling itself the Islamic Jihad Organisation in Iraq had demanded that staunch US ally Italy withdraw its 3000 troops stationed in Iraq, or the two Italians would be killed.</p><p>
Simon Pari and Simona Torretta were snatched from their office in a quiet neighbourhood of Baghdad on 7 September.</p><p>
8French TV pulls out* &nbsp;</p><p>
French state-owned television network France 3 said on Thursday it would stop sending journalists to Iraq because of security concerns, becoming the second French network in two days to suspend operations there. &nbsp; <br /><br />
cause for security concern</p><p>
On Wednesday the country's top commercial network TF1 said it had stopped sending news teams to Iraq.</p><p>
The announcements came as Paris pursued efforts to secure the release of Radio France correspondent Christian Chesnot, Le Figaro reporter Georges Malbrunot and their Syrian driver, who were abducted in Iraq on 20 August.</p><p>
France 2, another state-owned television network, will maintain its presence in Iraq for the time being, according to the station's deputy director general in charge of news, Arlette Chabot.</p><p>
"We want to be present in Baghdad as long as the French journalists and their Syrian driver are being held hostage," Chabot told Europe 1 radio, while acknowledging that working conditions were "really very difficult".</p><p>
<strong>Unrest</strong></p><p>
In separate developments, three Iraqis were killed near Khan Dhari district in Abu Ghraib area west of Baghdad during a US search operation, a medical source in Abu Ghraib hospital told Aljazeera. &nbsp;</p><p>
The forces launched the search operation after an explosive device targeting a US patrol detonated there, the source added. </p><p>
Also on Thursday, Sana Yusif, deputy manager of the Northern Oil Company in Mosul, was killed when unknown armed men opened fire at his vehicle in the city's Baladiyat neighbourhood in the morning. </p><p>
And in Miqdadiya town, northeast of Baghdad, five Iraqis, including three policemen, were injured when an explosive device went off. The blast occurred when an Iraqi police patrol passed through the area, sources said. </p><p>

    <div class="content"><p>Allawi: Iraq Will Hold Elections in Jan.</p><p>
Sep 23, 11:02 AM (ET)</p><p>
By JENNIFER LOVEN</p><p>
(WASHINGTON (AP) - Offering a simple, "Thank you America," Iraqi interim prime minister Ayad Allawi declared Thursday that his country is moving successfully past the war that ousted Saddam Hussein and vowed that elections will take place next year as scheduled.</p><p>
"Elections will occur in Iraq on time in January because Iraqis want elections on time," Allawi told a joint meeting of Congress, an appearance that President Bush's advisers hoped would ease American voters' doubts about the troubled campaign in Iraq.</p><p>
Despite struggles and setbacks, "the values of liberty and democracy" are taking hold in his country, Allawi proudly exclaimed. "We could hold elections tomorrow" in 15 of 18 provinces, he said, even though terror operatives hope to disrupt them.</p><p>
"The insurgency in Iraq is destructive but small, and it has not and will never resonate with the Iraqi people," Allawi said.</p><p>
He cautioned, however, that the election may not come off perfectly. But he assured it will be free and fair, "a giant step" in Iraq's political evolution.</p><p>
"Today, we are better off, you are better off, the world is better off without Saddam Hussein," Allawi said. He added: "Your decision to go into Iraq was not an easy one, but it was the right one."</p><p>
After his address, Allawi was heading to the White House for a meeting with President Bush, where the two leaders were to assert from the Rose Garden that progress is being made and the future is bright in Iraq.</p><p>
Allawi's speech before Congress - one of his first to a wider audience than those in Iraq - was punctuated by warm applause and standing ovations. Allawi joined in the applause and smiled broadly as he mingled among the lawmakers afterward.</p><p>
He echoed several of Bush's statements on Iraq, and sought to tie his country's struggle to the larger fight against global terrorism. Declaring himself "a realist," Allawi said he was trying to broaden the political process, drawing in as many Iraqi entities as possible, in an effort to weaken the insurgency.</p><p>
Allawi's two-day visit comes as troop casualties and civilian kidnappings in Iraq have increased, large parts of the country have come under the control of insurgents and doubts have surfaced at the United Nations that democratic elections can be held in January as planned.</p><p>
"We Iraqis know that Americans have made and continue to make enormous sacrifices to liberate Iraq, to assure Iraq's freedom," Allawi said. "I have come here to thank you and to promise you that your sacrifices are not in vain."</p><p>
An assessment of Iraq's future put together recently by U.S. intelligence officials spoke of possibilities ranging from tenuous stability to civil war, and even some senators in Bush's Republican Party have said there is a need for more candid talk from the White House.</p><p>
Gen. John Abizaid said Wednesday it was possible that more U.S. troops would be needed to secure Iraq's elections, but that Iraqi and perhaps international troops may be able to do the job instead.</p><p>
"I think we will need more troops than we currently have," Abizaid, commander of U.S. troops in the region, said after briefing the House.</p><p>
Bush has made clear that the importance of Allawi's visit lies largely in the opportunity for the Iraqi leader to reinforce for Americans the president's own confident assessment of Iraq.</p><p>
Allawi's visit marked his debut in Washington as prime minister, a post to which the skilled politician, who returned to Iraq last year after 30 years in exile, was appointed by a U.N. envoy with strong U.S. backing. It was also the highlight of a weeklong Bush administration effort to showcase what is going right in Iraq.</p><p>
Polls show that most voters think Bush made the right decision in using military force in Iraq and agree that the United States should stay as long as it takes to rebuild the nation.</p><p>
But they also show a growing number alarmed by the casualties and nearly 60 percent are doubtful that Bush has a clear plan for resolving the crisis. That has Bush's Democratic challenger, Sen. John Kerry, lobbing increasingly sharp attacks the president's way - and is sowing some worry in Bush campaign headquarters.</p><p>
Anthony Cordesman, a military analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, suggested that the administration should spend less time staging an attractive photo opportunity and more time adopting a realistic view of the challenges ahead.</p><p>
"As Prime Minister Allawi comes here, we need real accomplishments and real progress and honest measures of capability, not sound bites of rhetoric which are not substantiated by the figures being issued in detail by the United States government," he said. </p><p>

<strong>One Marine Killed in Anbar Province</strong><br /><br />
The Associated Press <br /><br />
Published: Sep 23, 2004 </p><p>
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - A U.S. Marine was killed while conducting security operations in Anbar province, the military said Thursday. <br /><br />
The Marine, assigned to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, was killed Wednesday. No details were disclosed. </p><p>
The name of the Marine was withheld pending notification of next of kin. </p><p>
In the Anbar city of Ramadi, two Iraqis were injured Thursday during clashes between U.S. troops and insurgents, said Dr. Alaa al-Ani of the Ramadi General Hospital. </p><p>
Witnesses said the incident occurred when gunmen attacked U.S. troops stationed at a local government building in the city 70 miles west of Baghdad. </p><p>
As of Wednesday, Sept. 22, 2004, 1,037 members of the U.S. military have died since the beginning of the Iraq war in March 2003, according to the Defense Department. Of those, 787 died as a result of hostile action. The figures include three military civilians. <br /></p>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>Left, right, the US out of step in Iraq</strong><br /><br />
By Frank Smyth </p><p>
(Posted with permission from Foreign Policy in Focus) </p><p>
One event in Baghdad has been largely unreported, not only by the mainstream media but also by the "alternative" press, even though it implies that US control over Iraq's political future may already be waning. In August, the White House supported the establishment of an Iraqi National Council comprising 100 Iraqis from various tribal, ethnic and religious groups in an effort to influence the composition of an electoral oversight body. </p><p>
But this month, two large political parties, each of which has long been viewed with suspicion by Washington, came out ahead in the voting. Many criticize the legitimacy of the process by which the administration of President George W Bush is hoping to steer Iraq toward national elections next January. The indirect elections for the council took place under war conditions, and there were reports that mortars exploded near the convention site in Baghdad where delegates had gathered. Iraqi delegates also expanded the number of vice-chairs in the national council from two to four. Had they not done so, the results might have been even more troubling for Washington. </p><p>
In the September balloting, the delegate from the Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Jawad al-Maliki, came in first with 56 votes. His is a Shi'ite group that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld lambasted as a tool of Iran during the US-led invasion of Iraq. Another Iraqi even less attractive to Washington, the secretary general of the Iraqi Communist Party, Hamid Majid Moussa, came in second with 55 votes. Meanwhile, Rasim al-Awadi, the delegate from the Iraqi National Accord - the group once backed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and whose leader, Iyad Allawi, was supported by the Bush administration to become prime minister - came in third with 53 votes. Nasir A'if al-Ani - the delegate from the Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni group sympathetic to the Ba'athist-based, anti-American resistance operating both west and north of Baghdad - came in fourth with 48 votes. </p><p>
By any count, getting only one ally elected to the four available seats on this potentially all-important electoral oversight body does not bode well for the Bush administration. After the Iraqi National Council was formed, but before it voted, White House spokesman Scott McClellan, while at Bush's family ranch in Crawford, Texas, declared, "The selection of the council is a sign that the Iraqi people will not allow terrorist elements to stand in the way of their democratic future." </p><p>
But what if elections in Iraq early next year lead to a government unlike anything ever expected by the Bush administration? The respected Arabist from the University of Michigan, Juan Cole, was among the first to report the Iraqi National Council election results on his blog. "So," he quipped, "this list is further evidence that the US invaded Iraq to install in power a coalition of communists, Islamists and ex-Ba'athist nationalists. If you had said such a thing three years ago you would have been laughed at." </p><p>
My enemy's friends<br /><br />
Many American leftists seem to know little about their Iraqi counterparts, since understanding the role of the Iraqi left requires a nuanced approach. Unfortunately, the knee-jerk, anti-imperialist analysis of groups such as International ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) has wormed its way into several progressive outlets. Dispatches and columns in The Nation magazine as well as reports and commentary on the independently syndicated radio program Democracy Now have all but ignored the role of Iraqi progressives, while highlighting, if not championing, the various factions of the Iraqi-based resistance against the US-led occupation without bothering to ask who these groups are and what they represent for Iraqis. </p><p>
By now several things about the Iraq war seem clear. The US-led invasion was the most dangerous and reckless step taken by the US since the Vietnam War, and America is already paying dearly and is sure to pay an even steeper price for this imprudent action. More than 1,000 American soldiers have died in little more than a year in a campaign that has undermined US security more profoundly than even presidential candidate John Kerry has managed to articulate. Never has the US (according to international public opinion polls) been so resented, if not loathed, by so many people around the world. And this is exactly the kind of environment in which al-Qaeda terrorists - who represent a real and ongoing threat to the US and others - thrive. </p><p>
US activists who demonstrated against the war in Iraq made an invaluable contribution by letting the rest of the world know that millions of Americans opposed the US-led invasion. But the enemy of one's enemy is not necessarily one's friend. To think otherwise is to embrace an Orwellian logic that makes anti-war Americans appear not only uninformed but also as cynical as the pro-war protagonists they oppose. The irony of the Iraq war is that the Bush administration made a unilateral decision to invade a nation in order to overthrow a leader who ranked among the most despised despots in the world but, in so doing, managed to turn countless people in many nations against the US. </p><p>
Who hated Saddam?<br /><br />
Saddam Hussein's detractors have always included none other than Osama bin Laden, who long derided the Iraqi leader as either an "infidel" or a "false Muslim" nearly every time he mentioned his name in any interview or recorded statement. The most radical of Muslims, in fact, know all too well that no modern Arab government tortured and murdered as many Muslims as did Saddam's Ba'athist regime. No Middle Eastern leader, either, tortured and murdered as many communists as Saddam did during the decades he was in power. </p><p>
The Arab Nationalist Renaissance Ba'athist Party has been both anti-communist and anti-Islamic and has unabashedly championed ethnic nationalism. In Iraq, the Ba'ath Party under Saddam instituted a minority based government. Ethnic Arabs of the mainstream Sunni Muslim faith have long dominated the Ba'ath Party, even though Sunni Arabs today constitute at most 17% of the Iraqi population, just a bit above the percentage of whites in South Africa. </p><p>
Ethnic Arabs of the Shi'ite Muslim sect, meanwhile, are nearly as numerous in Iraq as blacks are in South Africa. Anyone interested in empowering the poor should also know that Iraq's Shi'ite Muslims have long been the most indigent of Iraqis and suffered the most during the US-backed UN sanctions. Shi'ite males were often little more than cannon fodder for Saddam's various military adventures. Like the Shi'ites, Iraq's Kurds, about 20% of the population, never enjoyed more than token representation under Saddam. </p><p>
Resistance to Saddam's rule took many forms from 1979 to 2003, with anti-Saddam groups organized largely along Shi'ite Islamic, Kurdish nationalist, or Communist Party lines. Each of these groups lost tens of thousands of adherents to brutal counterinsurgency sweeps conducted by the Ba'athist government. Some American leftists apologized for Saddam's government, saying it was no worse than many others in the world. But Saddam's behavior deserves a category for itself, employing vicious repression and often including the torture and rape of family members of suspected dissidents. Few rulers anywhere in the world were so brutal, with the one exception of the CIA-backed government in Guatemala during the l980s. (Both that government and Saddam's, it is worth noting, were clandestinely aided by the US during the Ronald Reagan administration.) </p><p>
In more recent years, US leftists were not the only ones who ignored the various Iraqi groups that had long resisted Saddam's tyranny. The US right, led most recently by the neo-conservatives of the Bush administration, also ignored these resistance groups when they sought Iraqi allies during the buildup to the 2003 US invasion. Instead of reaching out to broad-based, anti-Saddam groups such as the Shi'ite Muslim opposition or the secular leftist resistance, both of which still had either armed or clandestine cadres inside Iraq as late as 2003, the Bush administration allied itself instead with a group of ex-monarchists led by the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi. A solid member of the old ruling class, Chalabi's father was the wealthiest man in Baghdad in 1958, when Iraq's short-lived, British-imposed monarchy was overthrown. The Ba'athists, eventually led by Saddam, came out on top in the ensuing power struggle, but both the Shi'ite majority and Iraq's second-largest population group, the Kurds, remained excluded from wealth as well as power. </p><p>
Resistance versus revolutionaries<br /><br />
Several factions are fighting US-led forces inside Iraq today, and the heavy-handedness of the US occupation has spurred many individual Iraqi nationalists to join them. American abuses have included breaking into homes, with male troops often manhandling women and terrifying children, firing into populated areas, causing many civilian casualties, and humiliating - as well as torturing - Iraqis inside Abu Ghraib prison. </p><p>
Yet all of the organized groups among the Iraqi resistance are reactionary forces of one kind or another. The resistance around and between the cities of Fallujah, Tikrit and Baghdad, in the so-called "Sunni triangle", is led by ex-Ba'athists who aspire to return the old minority based dictatorship to power. As Juan Cole points out, Nasir A'if al-Ani, the Sunni delegate to the Iraqi National Council from the Iraqi Islamic Party, does not even recognize the Shi'ite people as a majority in Iraq. (Not even the most recalcitrant Afrikaners in apartheid South Africa pretended that blacks were a minority.) </p><p>
Others like The Nation's Naomi Klein, meanwhile, seem to naively have fallen for the Mehdi militia that recently fought US Marines in Najaf. The Mehdi Army is a loosely organized Shi'ite opposition group led by Muqtada al-Sadr, a young man who inherited his role after his father and two brothers were murdered by Saddam. Lacking either the maturity or training of a senior cleric, Muqtada has tried to lure supporters from more-respected Shi'ite clerics by promoting militant enforcement of the most fundamental tenets of Shi'ite Islam, including the explicit repression of gays and women. </p><p>
The third sizable element of resistance inside Iraq is composed of foreign Islamist members of al-Qaeda, who, like both the Saudi royal family and bin Laden, practice an even more extreme version of Islam, Wahhabism. This group's recent victims may include two kidnapped Italian women who work for the Italian group A Bridge to Baghdad, which, like US anti-war groups working in Iraq, is explicitly opposed to the US occupation. The American anti-war group, Iraq Occupation Watch, seems to believe that members of the Iraqi resistance may be holding the women, pointing out on its website that the abductors should recognize that the Italian women are anti-war activists. On the other hand, Democracy Now's Jeremy Scahill and The Nation's Naomi Klein have written in The Guardian that a Western intelligence-backed group may be behind the abductions, suggesting that the CIA or others seized the two women to try to discredit the Iraqi opposition. </p><p>
The Iraqis favored by the Bush administration may be secular, but they are hardly more admirable people. Allawi is an ex-Ba'athist who left the Ba'ath Party in the mid-1970s. Paul McGeough of the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Allawi personally executed (with a handgun) six Iraqis in a Baghdad police station right before he became prime minister, though no proof of this crime has yet been forthcoming. Allawi's democracy credentials are also not impressive. He already has banned the Qatar-based satellite television network alJazeera and has imposed certain forms of martial law. </p><p>
Neither the resistance groups cheered on by many on the American left nor the governing parties championed by the American right seem to reflect the views and aspirations of most Iraqi people, who seem to be hoping for the rise of groups independent of both Saddam's reign and the increasingly dictatorial Allawi government. Possibilities include moderate Shi'ite groups and secular leftist ones, through whose leadership most Iraqis hope to find a way to empower themselves for the first time in their history. </p><p>
Unfortunately, mainstream Iraqis seem to have been all but forgotten by both the American left and right. Iraqis must be valued for who they are, not as pawns in some partisan political agenda. Such chauvinism might be expected of "America-first" right-wingers, but such a position is hardly defensible for any conscientious progressive. It's no wonder that instead of seeing Iraq's highly complex and, indeed, contradictory political reality, so many American leftists have chosen instead to cling to the comfort that comes from simple sloganeering. </p><p>

    <div class="content"><p>Denis D. Gray &nbsp;Associated Press Writer<br /><br />
Published: Sep 23, 2004</p><p>
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - U.S. warplanes fired on insurgent targets in the east Baghdad slum of Sadr City on Thursday in a second day of fighting in the Shiite militia stronghold. Iraqi doctors said one person was killed and 12 were injured, many of them children.</p><p>
The U.S. military said they launched an operation overnight aiming to "disband and disarm" militia loyal to the rebel Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and open way for reconstruction projects in the city.</p><p>
The Thursday attacks followed a day of fierce clashes between American troops and fighters loyal to al-Sadr.</p><p>
U.S. warplanes and helicopters roared overhead and residents said loud explosions could be heard for hours. Militia fighters returned fire with machine guns, they said.</p><p>
An American Bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and caught fire, according to a U.S. military report. It was not clear if there were any casualties.</p><p>
The aim of the operation, dubbed "Iron Fist 2," is to maintain pressure on al-Sadr by seizing weapons caches and detaining or killing his lieutenants, said Maj. Bill Williams, an acting battalion commander in the 1st Cavalry Division.</p><p>
The Americans believe that Sadr have been increasing his authority in Sadr City after last months agreement to stop hostilities between his followers and U.S. troops, using the lull in fighting to improve his position.</p><p>
"The main problem is that he has the militia," Williams said. "Our goal is to pressure him to disband and disarm."</p><p>
The military says that the insurgents have laid down booby traps throughout Sadr City and have repeatedly fired mortars toward an American base on its outskirts.</p><p>
Naim al-Kaabi, an official with al-Sadr's office, said the U.S. bombardments lasted until the morning, but said there was no street fighting. U.S. vehicles patrolled the slum Thursday morning.</p><p>
At least one person was killed and seven injured, said Dr. Qassim Saddam of Imam Ali Hospital. The nearby Al-Sadr General Hospital received five injured children, Dr. Atheer Al-Okabi said.</p><p>
The Iraqi Interior Ministry had no immediate information on the attacks.</p><p>
It was the third night of violence in the Shiite stronghold as U.S. forces crackdown on al-Sadr's al-Mahdi Army.</p><p>
Hospital officials said at least 10 people were killed and more than 90 injured in Wednesday's clashes, but U.S. military officers monitoring the fighting put the Iraqi death toll that day at around 40. There was no word on U.S. casualties.</p><p>
"The intent is to provide security for the people of Thawra so we can get back to the business of reconstruction," said 1st Cavalry Division commanding general Maj. Gen. Peter Chiarelli in a Wednesday statement. Thawra is an old name for Sadr City. The district is now named for Muqtada al-Sadr's father, a revered cleric killed under Saddam Hussein's regime.</p><p>

    <div class="content"><p>OTTAWA (Reuters) -- 22 September</p><p>
A Canadian woman who was kidnapped in Iraq (news - web sites) two weeks ago has been freed and is in the hands of U.S. troops, Foreign Minister Pierre Pettigrew said on Wednesday.</p><p>
"We were aware that she had been kidnapped and we had been working on the case. We're very relieved with this happy resolution," Pettigrew told CTV television after it emerged that 38-year-old Fairuz Yamulky was safe.</p><p>
She had not been previously reported as missing. CTV spelled her surname Yamucky but foreign ministry officials later said this was incorrect.</p><p>
News of Yamulky's release was broken by the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper, which had a correspondent aboard a U.S. helicopter on Tuesday night when it was asked to fly to a northern desert location to pick up the woman.</p><p>
The newspaper said that because Yamulky was being interrogated by U.S. forces, few details about her capture and release were available.</p><p>
Pettigrew defended his ministry's decision not to announce that Yamulky had been kidnapped.</p><p>
"When the family prefers that we keep the information private, we do that.... I think the happy resolution of the case might be part of the strategy that was adopted," he said.</p><p>
The newspaper said Yamulky worked for a company called GSF Cement and Sand Co., which was mainly doing business in Baghdad.</p><p>
Last week, a Canadian freelance reporter said he had been kidnapped briefly in northern Iraq and handed over to Arab militants who beat him and threatened to behead him.</p><p>
Canadian officials are still trying to free Mohammed Rifat, who disappeared on April 8 near Baghdad while working on a construction project. Two other Canadians kidnapped in separate incidents in April were released shortly afterward. </p>

<div class="title"><a href="story/2004/9/23/24946/5536#comment-21267" class="active">Abizaid says more US troops needed in Iraq</a></div>
    <div class="content"><p><a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A4A1E12E-19D9-4762-9D9C-2B9EBB064787.htm">http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A4A1E12E-19D9-4762-9D9C-2B9EBB064787.htm</a></p><p>
Amid escalating violence in Iraq and a reported withdrawal of the New Zealand contingent, the top US commander signals a striking reversal of policy and acknowledges more American troops are needed in Iraq.</p><p>
General John Abizaid, head of US Central Command, had initially stated that the security gap could be filled by Iraqi security forces and more international troops deployed to protect the UN-organised elections.</p><p>
But his remarks after closed door sessions with congressional armed services committee members late on Wednesday in Washington raised the prospect that the US may have to enlarge the 140,000-member force deployed in Iraq, at least during the elections.</p><p>
"I think we will need more troops than we currently have to secure the elections process in Iraq that will probably take place in the end of January," Abizaid told reporters.</p><p>
The statement is in contrast to recent calls to "bring our troops home" and may signal a new chapter in the Iraq debate between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>
The issue of whether the US has committed sufficient forces in Iraq to impose order is a touchy one for President George Bush, who has come under fire from Democratic challenger Senator John Kerry for Iraq's slide into bloodshed.</p><p>
"But it is our belief that those troops will be Iraqi troops. And they may be additional international troops that arrive to help out, as well, as part of the United Nations mission," he said.</p><p>
"And so I don't foresee a need for more American troops, but we can't discount it," he said. </p><p>
Critics' charge</p><p>
Critics have charged that the US force is too small to pacify Iraq, while US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has repeatedly insisted that Abizaid has been given and will be given all the forces he asks for to get the job done.</p><p>
Rumsfeld, who was with Abizaid on Wednesday, bristled when reminded that former army chief of staff general Eric Shinseki warned Congress before the US invaded Iraq in March 2003 that several hundred thousand troops would be needed to occupy the country.</p><p>
He said General Tommy Franks, who led the invasion of Iraq and was Abizaid's predecessor at the Central Command, had asked for a smaller force of about 200,000, including troops in Kuwait.</p><p>
"And the numbers that were provided were the numbers that were asked for by the combatant commander," Rumsfeld said.</p><p>
"There is no mystery about it. Nobody turned him down. &nbsp;Nobody said it should be a smaller number. And the people who are running around the world saying that simply are wrong," Rumsfeld said.</p><p>
New Zealand withdraws</p><p>
New Zealand's military personnel in Iraq will be home on Saturday, Defence Minister Mark Burton said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p>
The 61 army engineers, who have been based in Basra in southern Iraq, were due to leave by the end of the month after a year long deployment.</p><p>
They are to be flown out on a military Boeing 757 and be greeted by Prime Minister Helen Clark at Ohakea base, north of here.</p><p>
Clark earlier said it was unlikely any further deployments would be made. "I can't see that at this time. I think Iraq is just too difficult and too dangerous," she told Radio New Zealand on Wednesday.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Robert Burns &nbsp;The Associated Press<br /><br />
Published: Sep 23, 2004</p><p>
WASHINGTON (AP) - For U.S. troops in Iraq, homemade bombs are the main killers, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars the Pentagon has spent trying to curb the weapons made from simple, easy-to-obtain materials.</p><p>
As September shapes up as one of the deadliest months in Iraq for U.S. troops, the Pentagon estimates it is finding 40 percent of roadside bombs before they explode. But military officials say the problem persists even with teams of technical experts working to defeat the threat.</p><p>
In the first 22 days of the month, at least 63 members of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force died, Pentagon casualty reports show. With a week to go, September is the fifth deadliest month since President Bush declared an end to major combat operations on May 1, 2003.</p><p>
In addition, September has seen the beheadings of two American civilians and insurgent attacks that have killed dozens of Iraqi police and hundreds of civilians.</p><p>
More than 7,400 soldiers have been wounded since the war began, of whom 4,026 were unable to return to duty, according to Pentagon figures.</p><p>
The pace of U.S. military deaths has grown each month since the American occupation force handed over political control to an interim Iraqi government June 28. Both President Bush and military leaders like Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said they expect the violence to grow further in the months before January elections.</p><p>
At least 15 of the first 29 Army deaths in September were caused by homemade bombs, which the military calls improvised explosive devices. Most are hidden or disguised along roadways used by U.S. military convoys. Others are delivered to their target in cars and other vehicles.</p><p>
The Marine Corps does not announce the specific cause or place of death for its casualties, but Pentagon officials say IEDs are accounting for roughly the same share of Marine deaths as for the Army - about 50 percent. That would equate to at least a dozen Marines so far this month.</p><p>
At the Pentagon, one senior Army officer who monitors progress against the insurgency said the 155mm artillery shells and other explosives used to arm the improvised bombs are so easily available that the supply cannot be stopped, even though ammunition dumps are under surveillance. The officer discussed the problem only on condition that he not be identified.</p><p>
The officer estimated hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent so far trying to counter the IED threat, to no apparent effect.</p><p>
Within 24 hours of a reported IED attack, a team of military forensics experts and other specialists is dispatched to the scene. They inspect evidence, interview soldiers in the area and assess the technique used by the attackers. A recreation of the scene is sketched digitally and fed to experts who compare it with previous cases in search of patterns of attack.</p><p>
Remotely piloted surveillance aircraft are being used not only to search for IED attackers but also to monitor places where bombmakers are mostly likely to obtain explosives.</p><p>
That effort has enabled U.S. troops to find an estimated 40 percent of IEDs before they explode, but it has not stopped the killing and maiming. Indeed, bombs rigged to explode in cars or along U.S. supply convoy routes continue to kill or wound American troops and Iraqi security forces almost daily.</p><p>
On Tuesday, a car bomb exploded on Baghdad's airport road, wounding four U.S. soldiers and an unknown number of Iraqi civilians. On Wednesday, a roadside bomb killed a U.S. soldier near the city of Tikrit.</p><p>
On Sept. 6, seven members of the 1st Marine Division from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and three U.S.-trained Iraqi soldiers were killed by a car bomb near Fallujah, which is believed to be a base for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant whom U.S. officials believe spearheads much of the violence in Iraq.</p><p>
The most dangerous part of Iraq in recent weeks has been Anbar province, which includes the restive cities of Ramadi and Fallujah west of Baghdad as well as a long frontier with Syria where Marines have suffered numerous casualties from snipers, mortar attacks and roadside bombs.</p><p>
At least 30 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, have been killed in Anbar this month. At least 14 deaths were in Baghdad, the rest in various towns and cities, including Mosul, Balad and Baqubah.</p><p>

GORBACHEV SLAMS IRAQ WAR </p><p>
The former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, has attacked the war on Iraq - saying it undermined both international law and democracy. </p><p>
He has also spoken out against nuclear weapons, claiming they should be totally destroyed in the age of international terrorism.</p><p>
Speaking at a press conference in London, Mr Gorbachev cited the need to alleviate poverty as the best way to fight terrorism. </p><p>
The Nobel Peace Prize winner, 73, said: "I regard the invasion of Iraq as undermining international law and undermining democracy because millions of people spoke out against it. </p><p>
"Even before the beginning of the invasion, I said that I believed, and I still believe, it was a great mistake to fight that war. </p><p>
"First of all, because it was done without the mandate of the UN Security Council. </p><p>
"Then, of course, when the whole thing boomeranged, they did go back to the UN and they want them to help out." </p><p>
Mr Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika - openness and restructuring - helped end the Cold War. </p><p>
Speaking via a translator at the Foreign Press Association, he said that in the age of international terrorism it was necessary to destroy nuclear weapons, not just control them. </p><p>
He accused countries with nuclear arms of being hypocrites for attempting to stop other nations obtaining them while maintaining their own stockpiles. </p><p>
Mr Gorbachev also visited a school during his trip to Britain in support of the WMD Awareness Programme. </p>

    <div class="content"><p>Associated Press link <a href="http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGB0XVD8HZD.html">here.</a></p><p>
Reaction to interim Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's speech Thursday to a joint meeting of Congress:</p><p>
---</p><p>
"I think the prime minister is, obviously, contradicting his own statement of a few days ago, where he said the terrorists are pouring into the country. The prime minister and the president are here,obviously to put their best face on the policy, but the fact is that the CIA estimates, the reporting, the ground operations and the troops all tell a different story."- Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Democratic presidential candidate.</p><p>
---</p><p>
"It was a wonderful speech - the appreciation for what Americans sacrificed for his country. It was really good for him to come to encourage Americans to stay the course."- Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev.</p><p>
---</p><p>
"We welcome Prime Minister Allawi. I think he's outlined a series of extraordinary challenges that he is facing. But with an administration that has committed blunder after blunder after blunder in Iraq, it seems to me that it complicates his hopes and dreams for his nation. What is called for is a changed policy - this administration's incompetence with Iraq needs to be changed."- Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.</p><p>
---</p><p>
"It served its purpose of stressing the positive in what is obviously a difficult situation. I think we all have our concerns ... he shared those with us also."- Sen. Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I.</p><p>
---</p><p>
"He said what I expected him to say. I hope that his optimism will carry through and that he does in fact speak for the Iraqi people ... and that the insurgency is a minority effort by disgruntled former Baathists and outside intervention."- Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.</p><p>
---</p><p>
Allawi stood before Congress "with no illusions about the difficulties ... and a confidence that together we will overcome them."- Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.</p><p>
---</p><p>
"Prime Minister Allawi was correct to thank America for the sacrifices we have made to spread freedom to Iraq. And America is correct to stand firm on delivering on that promise of freedom. A free Iraq will be our partner to fight terror and spread hope and liberty throughout the world." - Rep. Candice Miller, R-Mich., chair of the Bush campaign in Michigan.</p><p>
---</p><p>
"Some remarked that it sounded like the State Department wrote his speech. I do think Mr. Allawi is as good an instrument of stability as we could come up with." - Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va. </p>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>Bush rules out withdrawal from Iraq</strong> </p><p>
&nbsp; Standing beside Iraq's interim leader, President George Bush warned that insurgents could "plot and plan attacks elsewhere, in America and other free nations," if the US pulled out. </p><p>
&nbsp; He said his top commander in Iraq has not asked for more troops but if he did, "I'd listen to him." <br /><br />
After meeting interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, Bush said he expected violence in Iraq to escalate as the country moved toward elections scheduled for January. Even so, Allawi said more foreign troops were not needed. &nbsp;</p><p>

Of course, at the time I posted that on the old Agonist Bulletin Board, everyone on the left was mistrusting the whole Zarqawi thing, thinking it was the creation of the C.I.A. And that, in itself, is a problem with this administration being able to complete this little project, mho: you can have no trust in what anyone says about the situation, and one questions what everyone says.</p><p>
If you <em>truly</em> want to understand what is going on with anything the U.S. military is doing, I recommend watching the House Armed Services Committee hearings <em>yourself</em> on C-Span. When the generals appear at those little thingies, they know they are begging for money, that's the only angle they have, and if not, one of the members usually calls 'em on it. The "soundbites" or "written bites" you get in the media are simply not enough, and get you conspiracizing...it's like cherry-picking. If you read this article now in hindsight, you will see that Abizaid had an accurate picture of the situation--Saddam supporters &amp; Zarqawi-influenced, and the WaPo reporters threw a wrench into the understanding of that by throwing in that unrelated quote from Bremer about "foreign fighters". Which made it seem like Bremer and Abizaid were on the "same page", spouting some Rove story, when in actuality, that was not the case.</p>

Thu Sep 23, 2004 05:05 PM ET </p><p>
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Thursday raised the possibility that some areas of Iraq night be excluded from elections scheduled for January if security could not be guaranteed.</p><p>
"Let's say you tried to have an election and you could have it in three-quarters or four-fifths of the country. But in some places you couldn't because the violence was too great," Rumsfeld said at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.</p><p>
"Well, so be it. Nothing's perfect in life, so you have an election that's not quite perfect. Is it better than not having an election? You bet," he said.</p><p>
Rumsfeld testified to the committee hours after Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and President Bush both insisted national elections would be held on schedule in January despite the flaring insurgency.</p><p>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has suggested elections may have to be delayed because of security concerns.</p><p>
Under questioning on prospects for elections amid the rising violence, Rumsfeld first said, "I shouldn't be saying this because I just don't know enough about it. It's something the ambassador is working on."</p><p>
Rumsfeld said the security situation "is notably different in different parts of the country," and said he believed Allawi was correct that elections could be held in January.</p><p>
"They have met every single benchmark politically," Rumsfeld said. "They are making progress at a time when the extremists are chopping people's heads off."</p><p>
Allawi was in Washington amid rising violence in Iraq from suicide bombings, kidnappings and the beheading of hostages.</p><p>
Rumsfeld said the United States will send more troops if Gen. John Abizaid, the U.S. commander for the region, asks for them to try to quell violence before the elections.</p><p>
Rumsfeld denied that the Pentagon had painted "a rosy picture" of the situation in Iraq. But he conceded during a sharp exchange with Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts over the growing violence there that the security situation could be even worse during the Iraqi election in January.</p><p>
"Let's say it's worse," said Rumsfeld. "So be it. Nothing's perfect in life."</p><p>
But Kennedy and the committee's ranking Democratic member, Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, charged that organized attacks by insurgents had gotten far worse in the past two months despite Bush's claim that tough progress was being made toward democracy.</p><p>
"We're operating in two different worlds," said Kennedy. "During August, 900 American troops were killed or wounded. The number is going up, not going down."</p><p>

I'd like to see a US election with only 3/4 of the states. If I get to pick the exempted areas, it certainly would be better!</p>
