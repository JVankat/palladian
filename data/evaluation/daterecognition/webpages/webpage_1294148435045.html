"Patrick Kearney, presiding genius of the establishment, has a beautiful set of red whiskers which he wears a la Dundreary. The police have quelled several riots which started from the attempt of some carouser to fondle the same Dundreary whiskers."</p><p>Dundreary whiskers were long, flowing sideburns, somewhat like mutton chops, named after Lord Dundreary, a character in a popular play, "Our American Cousin."</p><p>The story goes on to say that Kearney had recently arrived from the "Ould Sod" and that "beer and brouge" (brogue?) are doled out to the customers. When a customer once complained that the beer was flat, Kearney was quoted as saying, "Oi know, me boy, it is a trifle flat. But it is better for your stomach that way."</p><p>The story sadly noted that by order of the Sanitary Inspector, the lights were out, "the jangling piano stilled and Stevens Street mourned."</p><p>Today, O'Doherty's Irish Grille fills the Irish bar niche not far from the old Shamrock in downtown Spokane -- but without the problems or the Dundrearys.</p><p>Meanwhile, I'll throw out this related question: For what other reason has "Our American Cousin" gone down in history?</p><p>Those well-versed in America's past shouldn't have much trouble answering that one.</p></div><div class='blogtrailer'>Posted by Jim &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=2341' title='link to post'>21 Dec&nbsp;10:33 PM</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=2341#comments' title='read comments'>Comments (2)</a></div><h2>Spokane's grand old theaters</h2><div class='blogpost'><p>In a recent column I mentioned Spokane's rich vaudeville history, which spurred readers to ask: Where was the old Pantages Theatre?</p><p><img src="/blogs/history/media/theater2.jpg" align=left>The Pantages was on the east side of Howard, south of Main. It was built in 1917 and became Spokane's stop on the national Pantages circuit. It changed its name to the Orpheum in 1930 (which is why the sign says Orpheum on the accompanying photo)and converted entirely to movies in 1932. It was torn down in in 1958. The site now consists of the Parkade Plaza and Rite Aid Drug Store.</p><p>It was a beautiful building, with six fluted Corinthian pilasters across the front and many other examples of classical ornamentation.<br>However, it was surpassed by Spokane's true theatrical gem, the Auditorium, on the northwest corner of Main and Post.</p><p><img src="/blogs/history/media/theater1.jpg" align=right>This magnificent building was a Spokane landmark from 1890 to 1934, with its massive corner tower projecting more than seven stories above the street.</p><p>The stage was deliberately built extra-large -- in fact, it was the largest in the world when it was built. The architect, Herman Preusse, deliberately made it one foot deeper than the Chicago theater that held the record, according to "Spokane Building Blocks," by Robert Hyslop.</p><p>The 1,750-seat theater had three balconies and a number of what we would today call "luxury boxes." Hyslop calls them "half-round palaces."<br>Sarah Bernhardt sang there; so did Al Jolson. And the 14-year-old Bing Crosby worked there as, in his own words, a "flunky in the prop department."</p><p>Yet as early as 1924 it was being used mostly as a movie house. This premier Spokane landmark was torn down in 1934. The site became a Pay Less drug store for a while and is now River Park Square.</p><p>As Hyslop says, sic transit gloria mundi.</p></div><div class='blogtrailer'>Posted by <a href='mailto:jimk@spokesman.com' title='email'>Jim</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=1511' title='link to post'>9 Dec&nbsp;5:37 PM</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=1511#comments' title='read comments'>Comments (5)</a></div><h2>Who's buying the Colville Reservation?</h2><div class='blogpost'><p>The Dec. 4 history column in the Spokesman-Review titled <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/features/story.asp?ID=104474">"'Fair Offer' of $37"</a>, was about the opening of the Colville Reservation to white settlement in 1905. In the story, I mentioned that many of those lands have been re-acquired, and that the Colville Tribes have a policy of buying back lands put up for sale.<br>I received an e-mail from a person identified only as "a concerned tribal member" who said that the policy falls short of the reality. The writer said that if tribal members can't get a competitive offer from a tribal member, they are allowed to sell to non-tribal members -- and this is happening all over the reservation.<br>"This is disturbing to me as a tribal member," said the writer. "I see these small acres with huge houses going up all over my family's historic hunting/fishing/gathering sites. Sure, I am jealous, but I am also outraged because the tribes cannot compete with non-members in every instance."<br>So what do you think? Is this indeed cause for outrage? I'd like to hear from tribal members and non-tribal members on this subject.</p></div><div class='blogtrailer'>Posted by <a href='mailto:jimk@spokesman.com' title='email'>Jim</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=1508' title='link to post'>9 Dec&nbsp;4:45 PM</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=1508#comments' title='read comments'>Comments (5)</a></div><h2>Request for info: Muir's daughter, Fred Moore, Stadacona Park</h2><div class='blogpost'><p>I'm passing along requests for information submitted by three readers about various regional historical issues.</p><p>The first comes from Patrick Gooden, who is trying to find the burial place of one of John Muir's daughters, who moved to Spokane for her health and ended up staying here. Her name was either Wanda or Helena. He believes she was unmarried. I checked our archives and could find no information on her based on this limited information. I am posting it in case any readers can help.</p><p>The second comes from Ron Myers, who is seeking information about Fred H. Moore, a well-known labor attorney who defended Sacco and Vanzetti. Moore lived in Spokane from 1889 to 1910. Myers was hoping someone might have old letters or other information related to Moore.</p><p>Third, Cindy Fine asks if anyone knows anything about Stadacona Park, a tiny oval park between Arthur and Perry and 10th and 11th. Our archive notes that it was absorbed into the larger Grant Park around 1968. As for the name, I could find only that there was once a Stadacona Farm near the present airport, suggesting that the name is a family name from some early residents. But I can't find much about the park beyond that.</p><p>If anybody can shed light on any of these issues, please reply by clicking on the "comments" link.</p></div><div class='blogtrailer'>Posted by <a href='mailto:jimk@spokesman.com' title='email'>Jim</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=1507' title='link to post'>9 Dec&nbsp;4:13 PM</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=1507#comments' title='read comments'>Comments (1)</a></div><h2>Do schoolmarms make good wives?</h2><div class='blogpost'><p><img src="/blogs/history/media/school.jpg" align=right>Poring over turn-of-the-century newspapers can be vastly entertaining -- not to mention appalling.</p><p>Here's a story I stumbled across from a 1905 edition of The Spokesman-Review which earnestly debates the question: Can women schoolteachers ever make good wives?</p><p>Here's what C.L. Shuff, a male teacher in Spokane, was quoted as saying: "I do not say that a teacher should not marry, but I do say a woman should not teach. In our order of society a woman's place is to be mistress of a home and teaching is not conducive to making a woman a good housewife. In the first place, when a woman teaches school, she comes to depend on others to do the work of housekeeping and she grows to dislike these duties. In the next place, teaching gives a woman a mental attitude which is unfortunate in home life."</p><p>Shuff illustrates his point with an anecdote about a trip he took with a group of people, one of whom was a schoolteacher. She was, in his words, "constantly running off by herself, perfectly oblivious to the rest of the party." She then "spent her time taking notes of trivial things till her husband and the rest of us were completely out of patience with her."</p><p>He concludes that "this attitude of hers is directly due to the fact that she had been a school teacher for a long time."</p><p>Other local men defended women school teachers, including a former Spokane school superintendent, who said that the stereotype of woman teachers as "finicky and irritable" was disappearing.</p><p>"The finicky women are being weeded out and the teachers who are now employed are the sweet-tempered women. Their training is entirely along the lines of increasing these qualities and as a consequence school teachers are tolerant women, and not liable to be critical and fault-finding with their husbands. As far as I can see, there is absolutely no ground for the statement that school teachers do not make good wives and should not marry."</p><p>The paper went so far as to put the question to a woman teacher, who replied, in essence, that she doesn't know what all the fuss is about. She said she knows many women teachers who are happily married.</p><p>It fell to J.A. Tormey, the school superintendent at the time, to give the most enlightened reply to the question.</p><p>"Personally, I think the school teachers are the best class of women we have and make the best wives," said Tormey. "They are intellectual and take life seriously and when men come to know them, they are attracted by these qualities."</p><p>But then we go back to Mr. Shuff, who summed up his argument by saying, "Teaching school is a man's business and women should be kept out of it. It is no more right to compel a man to compete with cheap female labor in teaching than with cheap Chinese labor in another line of work."</p><p>Ooooh-kay.</p><p>So, here's my question: Have attitudes come a long way since 1905? Or not?</p><p><i>Photo: The students of Greer School, west of Cheney, pose with their teacher, Mrs. Van Brunt, in 1937. Mrs. Van Brunt taught all eight grades in the one-room school.</i>   </p></div><div class='blogtrailer'>Posted by <a href='mailto:jimk@spokesman.com' title='email'>Jim</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=928' title='link to post'>1 Dec&nbsp;6:09 PM</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='archive.asp?postID=928#comments' title='read comments'>Comments (1)</a></div>
