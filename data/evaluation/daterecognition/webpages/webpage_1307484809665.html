<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2. Cannabis in Switzerland: The current situation </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="2.1 Prevalence of cannabis use ">2.1 Prevalence of cannabis  use </a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="2.1.1 Development of cannabis use from 1970 to 1998">2.1.1  Development of cannabis use from 1970 to 1998</a></strong></p>
<p>A number of studies of drug and, more particularly, cannabis use in  Switzerland have been carried out since the early 1970s. Not all of them used  the same methodology, so the findings are not comparable in strictly scientific  terms. However, they do give a good impression of the magnitude of the problem.  The term "prevalence" is often used to describe the extent to which a drug is  used. It shows how often a drug is consumed during a defined period of time (e.  g. the lifetime prevalence is the number of individuals who have used the drug  at any time in their life). The consumption of cannabis by Swiss adolescents is  not a new phenomenon. As long ago as 1971, the lifetime prevalence of cannabis  consumption among 19- year- old men required to enlist for military service in  the canton of Zurich was 23.3 percent, and the figure for a comparison  population of women was 13.5 percent. At that time 8.2 percent of the men and  3.5 percent of the women had had frequent experience of cannabis (had used it  more than ten times). In another study in 1978, also carried out in the canton  of Zurich among 19- year- olds, the lifetime prevalence of cannabis consumption  was only 19.9 percent for men but 17.2 percent for women. Frequent use (more  than ten times) had increased to 8.5 percent among the men and 5.7 percent among  the women (Sieber 1988). In a survey of recruits from all parts of Switzerland  carried out in 1972/ 73, the lifetime prevalence of cannabis consumption was  20.1 percent, with 5.7 percent claiming frequent use (more than six times)  (Battegay et al 1977). An evaluation of the pedagogical examinations of recruits  carried out in 1993 showed the lifetime prevalence to be around 44 percent, with  frequent use (more than ten times) at 18.5 percent (Wydler et al 1996).</p>
<p>A written questionnaire distributed by Wydler et al in 1993 showed a 12-  month prevalence of 32.1 percent among young men aged 20 and 16.8 percent among  women of the same age. The most recent data were compiled during a telephone  survey commissioned by the Swiss Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and  Drug Problems (SFA/ SIPA) in February 1998:</p>

<p>The written surveys carried out by the SFA/ SIPA among male and female  students aged 15 show a clear increase in cannabis consumption between 1986 and  1998. The proportion of 15- year- olds with experience of cannabis more than  tripled over the last12- years. In 1986, 2.5 percent reported having used this  soft drug once, in 1998 the figure was 8.4 percent. In 1986, 3 percent used  hashish or marijuana "occasionally", by 1998 the figure was four- and- a- half  times higher (13.8 percent). In 1986, 2.9 percent used cannabis frequently, in  1998, 8.6 percent. A study by Narring et al in 1992/ 93 of the health- related  behaviors of young Swiss people aged 15 to 20 largely confirmed the findings of  the college study of 15- year- olds. The study showed that above age 18, almost  half of young men have used cannabis at least once, although 30 percent of them  state that they have only used it once or twice. The figures are around 10  percent lower for women.</p>
<p><img src="/images/stories/reports/swisscan/2.jpg" border="0" alt="2" width="512" height="384" /></p>
<p>Cannabis use is more common among younger people, but a study in 1987  (Fahrenkrug, Müller 1990) showed that 20 percent of people over 34 had used  cannabis at some time. As many as 12 percent of those aged 35 to 44 and 5.8  percent of those aged 45 to 54 had also used cannabis at least once in their  lifetime. Extrapolated to the entire population, this would mean that some  550,000 people aged between 15 and 74 had used cannabis at that time. According  to the Swiss Health Surveys for the years 1992/ 93 and 1997/ 98, the lifetime  prevalence for the age group 15 to 39 in Switzerland rose from 16.3 to 26.9  percent during this period. Extrapolated to the entire population of the  country, some 685,000 Swiss people between the ages of 15 and 39 in 1998 had  used cannabis at some time. An increase is also discernible among current users:  in the period 1992/ 93, 4.4 percent of those surveyed were using cannabis  products, while in the period 1997/ 98 the corresponding figure was 7.1 percent.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.1.2 Age at first use">2.1.2 Age at first use</a></strong></p>
<p>Little information is available on the age at which illegal drugs are first  consumed. It is difficult to find such data since most studies provide only data  from cross- sectional analyses. Calculations based on survival models for drug  users show that the age at which drugs are first consumed has not changed  greatly in recent years; it has remained at around 16 (Gmel, Rehm 1996).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.1.3 International comparison">2.1.3 International  comparison</a></strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to compare drug use on an international scale because the  groups surveyed, the times at which they are surveyed and the types of survey  differ so widely between countries. Against this background, the attempt made by  Kraus and Bauernfeind (1998) to draw up an international comparison of the  lifetime prevalence of cannabis use should be approached with caution.  Switzerland ranges in the middle field among the nine countries for which  lifetime prevalences are shown in the illustration below; the Scandinavian  countries have lower prevalences, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom and Spain  have higher figures. One striking feature is the fairly similar overall figures  for Spain, West Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, although the cannabis policy in  these countries differs considerably (Cattacin, Renschler 1997).</p>
<p><img src="/images/stories/reports/swisscan/3.jpg" border="0" alt="3" width="512" height="384" /></p>
<p>In most European countries there was a slight to moderate increase in the  prevalence of cannabis consumption during the 1980s (Kraus, Bauernfeind 1998).  However, the report on Europe issued by the WHO in 1997 gives a mixed picture of  the trends in cannabis consumption in this region from the early to mid- 90s.  The nine western European countries that provided information on trends in  cannabis use all reported an increase in consumption, but within these countries  the patterns are very different from one region to another.</p>

<p>Cannabis may be used legally as a renewable raw material in the textile, oil,  paper, rope and construction industries and in the production of foodstuffs and  consumer goods; it is also consumed illegally as a narcotic (marijuana, hashish,  hash oil). There has been a sharp increase in cannabis cultivation in  Switzerland recently, with the resulting products destined not only for the  legal market but also, and more particularly, for illicit consumption as  narcotics (" drug- grade cannabis").</p>

<p>The drug grade has a THC * content in excess of 0.3 percent (see 2.3); the  industrial or fiber grade contains less than 0.3 percent THC. Since even experts  cannot distinguish "industrial cannabis" from "drug cannabis" with the naked  eye, it is not possible to tell what type of cannabis is being cultivated unless  the plants are analyzed chemically. The figures for b) in the above table have  therefore been classified as "other uses" even though it has to be assumed that  these crops are used predominantly to produce "drug cannabis".</p>
<p>*THC: The active principle is tetrahydrocannabinol (cf. Chapter 2.3). In this  report only the abbreviation THC will be used (except in Chapters 2.3 and 2.5).</p>

<p>The cannabis plant is well adapted to the geography, soil and climate in  Switzerland. It makes few demands on the soil and can generally be grown without  the aid of chemical crop protection agents. As such it is an ideal candidate for  integrated production (IP) and ecological cultivation. From an agronomic point  of view, the prospects for the successful reintroduction of industrial cannabis  production are excellent. There is major public interest in ecological products  derived from sustainable resources. Cannabis is a promising plant which is easy  to grow and provides a high quality raw material. This is why the "renewable raw  materials" project being run by the Federal Office of Agriculture (BWL) is  funding the cultivation of low- THC cannabis (containing less than 0.3 percent  THC) for industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Switzerland has had a type list 1 covering the marketing of cannabis seed for  agricultural purposes since 1 March 1998. This list restricts trade in cannabis  seeds and plants to varieties containing low levels of THC. The cultivation of  cannabis and activities outside the agricultural context (e. g. ornamental  plants) are not covered by this regulation.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.2.1.2 Cannabis for food products, cosmetics and consumer goods">2.2.1.2  Cannabis for food products, cosmetics and consumer goods</a></strong></p>
<p>The flowers, seeds, fatty and volatile l oils, and other parts of the hemp  plant are currently used to manufacture foodstuffs and cosmetics. A variety of  products including hemp oil, biscuits, chocolate, confectionery, pasta, "beer  flavored with hemp blossom", and a number of skin and hair care products can be  purchased. Food products and cosmetics containing hemp are not permitted to have  any pharmacological activity. The revision of the Ordinance on Foreign  Substances and Ingredients in Food Products (FIV) dated 30 January 1998  established threshold values for the THC content of various foods 2 . By analogy  with the FIV, a limit of 50 mg/ kg is applied to cosmetic products which are  left on the skin. The situation in the food and cosmetics sector has eased  considerably since these threshold values were introduced. Most of these  cannabis products are sold in so- called hemp shops (in 1998 there were around  135 such shops in Switzerland). However, hemp shops sell not only legal products  but also illicit cannabis products (cf. 2.2.2 Illegal use and 2.7 Enforcement of  the existing legislation).</p>

<p>The cultivation of drug- grade hemp and the associated sales of products made  from this hemp are increasing from year to year in Switzerland. Relevant data  from a number of cantons show that a large quantity of products based on drug-  grade hemp are already being exported, and that an increasing volume of  equipment and other items used in hemp cultivation and to produce marijuana and  hashish are being imported into Switzerland. It can be assumed on the basis of a  survey covering all cantons that most of the illegal trade in hashish is still  carried out on the street, as it always has been. "Hemp shops", on the other  hand, are increasingly the channel through which marijuana is sold; most of it  is packed into and sold in the form of "aromatic pillows". In Ticino canton  practically the entire cannabis market has gravitated towards "hemp shops". The  police view is that the vast majority of hemp fields in Switzerland are used to  produce cannabis supplied to the drug trade. It can be assumed that in 1998  considerably more than 100 metric tons of drug- grade cannabis were harvested.  Today Switzerland has an almost nationwide network of 135 hemp shops. The big  increase started in 1996 and led to the creation of major centers in the city  and canton of Zurich (a total of 36), in the canton of St. Gallen (18), in  Ticino (16) in Basel (7) and in the canton of Berne (6). Police information  shows that between 85 and 95 percent of sales in most hemp shops come from drug  products (" hemp pillows", "aromatic bags", "refills for aromatic bags", "hemp  coins" etc.) The THC content of cannabis sold in "aromatic bags" is frequently  between 8 and 10 percent, for example. The people who sell hemp products (in  hemp shops) claim that their products (such as "aromatic pillows") are not  intended for making drugs, and that it is therefore legal to sell them. It is up  to the public prosecution agency to gather additional evidence and prove that  the cultivation of hemp or the product in question is intended for making  illegal narcotic substances or for consumption as an illegal drug. Chapter 2.7  deals with the difficulties faced by the prosecution authorities in  distinguishing between legal and illegal use when inspecting areas used to  cultivate cannabis and hemp shops.</p>

<p><strong><a name="2.2.3 Hemp cultivation">2.2.3 Hemp cultivation</a></strong></p>
<p>The cultivation of hemp for consumption has reached industrial proportions in  Switzerland in the last few years. In 1997, 7.2 metric tons of hemp products and  313,258 hemp plants were impounded. Although reliable data are difficult to come  by, it can be assumed that Switzerland has become a hemp- exporting country and  is one of Europe's two major producers, the other being the Netherlands. Hemp is  also being cultivated increasingly in private gardens and on balconies. This may  be partly because hemp is an attractive ornamental plant; in many cases,  however, this cannabis is no doubt intended for consumption. This report will  not look at hemp cultivation in greater detail. The current situation and the  related problems are described in the relevant documentation compiled during the  amendment of the Swiss Narcotics Act, which was scheduled for distribution to  the cantons for comment during the summer of 1999. Models which the Commission  feels could be suitable for hemp cultivation are described in Chapters 3 and 6.</p>

<p>Note on this chapter: In some places the following text goes into far more  detail than the other chapters in this report. This exhaustive approach was  taken deliberately, since an understanding of the complex effects of cannabis is  vital for an objective discussion of the subject in hand, and very little  summarizing literature is available on the aspects portrayed here. The reader  not familiar with the biological terminology can omit the paragraphs printed in  italics and smaller type without losing the essence of the text.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.1 Introduction">2.3.1 Introduction</a></strong></p>
<p>According to the current system of botanical classification, hemp belongs to  the genus Cannabis which, together with the genus Humulus – hops, are included  in the Family Cannabidaceae (Hagers Handbuch [...] 1992). Although the wide  variety of characteristic features would suggest that there are several species  of cannabis, today only one collective species is recognized, Cannabis sativa  (Lehmann 1995). The other species commonly referred to, Cannabis indica – Indian  hemp, is in fact a subspecies of Cannabis sativa (Fankhauser 1996). Cannabis  sativa is a dioecious, green, leafy plant with characteristic opposite, usually  sevenfingered, lance- shaped leaves; on dry, sandy, slightly alkaline soil it  can grow to more than 7 meters in height. Glandular hairs develop, usually on  the female flower, which secrete a resin. The greatest density of glandular  hairs is found on the sepals and on the underside of the last leaves to form  (Geschwinde 1996). The female plants are more important than the male plants for  commercial purposes: their fibers are thicker, they form the nutritious seeds,  and they contain the psychoactive principle tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is  much sought after by producers of marijuana and hashish. Unlike most of the  substances used in our western culture to induce an intoxication, cannabis is  not a single substance but contains a large number of different components; over  420 have been identified to date. The cannabinoids, of which there are over 60,  are the most important class containing the active principle responsible for the  psychotropic effects of the plant, (-)- trans- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (referred  to in the following as 9 -THC). Basically all the parts of the Cannabis sativa  plant can contain cannabinoids, not just the seeds, but the quantity varies from  one part to another. The resin secreted by the female glandular hairs contains  up to 90 percent cannabinoids, the bracts of the flowers and fruits contain an  average of 3 to 6 percent, and the leaves contain only 1 to 3 percent  (Geschwinde 1996). The fiber grade of cannabis is cultivated for industrial  purposes, and the legislation in the European countries requires this type to  contain no more than 0.3 percent THC (see also 2.2.1). The most important  cannabis products in the drug trade are marijuana and hashish. Marijuana  consists of all the dried parts of the plant; it is sold either loose or pressed  and contains up to 2 percent THC. The THC content is increased (up to 6 percent)  by using only the flowering tops of the female plants. Hashish is a particularly  resinous form of cannabis, and good quality hashish contains between 10 and 20  percent THC (Lehmann 1995). The THC content of cannabis plants can be increased  by selective breeding and optimal growing conditions. The ”Sinsemilla” type of  marijuana, for example, had a THC content of 1 percent in the 1960s, 8.5 percent  in the early 1980s, and as much as 17 to 22 percent in the 1990s (Adams, Martin  1996; Geschwinde 1996).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.2 Cannabis in the body">2.3.2 Cannabis in the body</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.2.1 Absorption, metabolism and excretion">2.3.2.1 Absorption,  metabolism and excretion</a></strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is usually smoked as a "joint", a variable mixture of hashish (or  marijuana) and tobacco. The dosage depends on the desired effect (generally one  cigarette containing 2 percent THC). The active principle is absorbed very  rapidly via the respiratory tract and lungs, with an onset of action just a few  minutes later. The effect peaks at 15 minutes, subsides gradually after 30 to 60  minutes, and is largely finished after 2 to 3 hours (Geschwinde 1996). The  bioavailability (proportion of substance active in the body) depends greatly on  the smoker's technique and varies between 10 and 25 percent (with a maximum of  56 percent). THC is absorbed by the body much more slowly after oral intake  (eating or drinking) and then has a lower bioavailability of 4 to 12 percent  because of the poorer absorption, catabolism in the liver and the fact that the  inactive tetrahydrocannabinolidic acids in natural cannabis products cannot be  transformed into psychoactive 9 -THC unless they are heated first, as is the  case when they are smoked (Lehmann 1995). In contrast to absorption through the  respiratory tract, in which peak plasma concentrations of THC may be achieved  while the product is being smoked, the plasma concentration increases constantly  over a period of 4 to 6 hours when cannabis is ingested; a state of intoxication  is reached later and is of a different quality.</p>
<p>The high solubility of 9 -THC and its active metabolite 11- OH- 9 -THC in fat  mean that they are bound almost completely to protein in the plasma, cross the  blood- brain barrier with ease, and are eliminated only slowly from lipid-  containing tissue. This slow elimination gives the substances a biological half-  life of one day (Lehmann 1995); other authors have reported half- lives of three  to five days (Adams, Martin 1996). The substances are thought to be metabolized  twice as quickly by chronic users of cannabis as by first- time users (Adams,  Martin 1996; Maykut 1985).</p>
<p>The relationship between plasma concentrations and the degree of intoxication  is discussed in Chapter 2.3.5 (Cannabis and driving).</p>
<p>The cannabinoids are metabolized rapidly in the liver. To date, some 80  different, mostly inactive metabolites have been identified (Agurell et al  1986). No major metabolic differences between male and female users of cannabis  have been observed (Wall et al 1983).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.2.2 Pharmacodynamics">2.3.2.2 Pharmacodynamics</a></strong></p>
<p>Specific research into the mode of action of cannabis was not possible until  1964 (Agurell et al 1986), when 9 -THC was isolated and its structure was  elucidated. It then became possible to develop substances with an action similar  to THC, some of them highly potent. During the 1980s, various scientific  findings removed any lingering doubt about the existence of specific cannabis  receptors (Bidaut- Russel et al 1990; Dewey et al 1984; Howlett, Fleming 1984;  Howlett et al 1986).</p>
<p>A cannabinoid receptor (CB1) located predominantly in the cerebellum, the  hippocampus and the cerebral cortex was finally discovered and cloned in 1990  (Axelrod, Felder, 1998). A further, peripheral, receptor (CB2) was found in  certain parts of the immune system (e. g. the spleen) in 1993 (Abood, Martin,  1996; Lehmann, 1995). Investigations carried out to date would seem to confirm  that these receptors are capable of affecting neurophysiological processes in  the brain (Axelrod, Felder, 1998). Future research will reveal the extent to  which processes of this type involving cannabinoid receptors are linked to the  complex effects of cannabis in humans.</p>
<p>In 1992 the endogenous ligand (linking substance) anandamide was discovered;  it is thought to be synthesized and released on an ad hoc basis (Abood, Martin  1996; Axelrod, Felder 1998; Di Marzo et al 1994).</p>
<p>The discovery of the cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands, and the  development of specific agonists and antagonists in the past and the future, are  making a major contribution to scientific understanding of the effects of  cannabis, of the neurophysiological role played by thes receptors, and of the  possible effects on the human brain and its functions in the context of chronic  cannabis use. New knowledge will perhaps enable us to develop an active  principle which is therapeutically highly active but has none of the  psychoactive properties.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.3 Acute effects of cannabis on the central nervous system">2.3.3 Acute  effects of cannabis on the central nervous system</a></strong></p>
<p>The psychotropic (affecting the central nervous system and the mind) action  of cannabis is one of the reasons why cannabis products are used so widely. As  mentioned above, cannabis starts to act more rapidly and more intensively when  it is smoked, and the intoxication lasts a shorter time, than when it is  absorbed through the digestive system. The effect of cannabis depends not only  on its composition, dosage and mode of consumption; much also depends on the  mood of the individual, on the individual's expectations and on the atmosphere  and setting. These factors explain why the altered state of consciousness, which  may amount to pronounced intoxication, is experienced so differently by  different people. At a low to moderate dose, cannabis produces a largely  pleasant feeling of relaxed euphoria, perhaps even with dreamy elements, which  may be accompanied by heightening or alteration of the senses (Hagers Handbuch  [...] 1992). The sense of time shifts markedly, and the individual perceives  periods of time as being considerably longer than they really are. Short- term  memory is impaired (Lehmann 1995), although recall of previously acquired  knowledge is impaired only slightly if at all. It is uncertain whether other  higher functions of the brain, such as the organization and integration of  complex information, are affected (Adams, Martin 1996). Higher doses produce a  general reduction in spontaneity, drive and involvement in the surroundings.  Anxiety, confusion, aggressive feelings, (pseudo) hallucinations, nausea and  vomiting have all been reported but are not usually experienced. They may,  however, develop even in experienced users (Hagers Handbuch [...] 1992; Lehmann,  1995). As the effects of THC subside, the individual often becomes drowsy and  tired, but there is no "hang- over" comparable to the effect experienced after  heavy alcohol consumption.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.4 Acute side effects and toxicity of cannabis">2.3.4 Acute  side effects and toxicity of cannabis</a></strong></p>
<p>The physiological effects observed immediately after consumption are  reddening of the conjunctivae, a reduction in body temperature, a dry mouth and  throat, hunger, a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure when lying  down, and a drop in heart rate and blood pressure when standing (Adams, Martin  1996; Dewey 1986; Hagers Handbuch [...] 1992). The acute toxicity of cannabis is  generally thought to be low. If the dose of cannabis lethal in rhesus monkeys is  extrapolated to man, a human would have to smoke 100 grams of hashish to achieve  the same effect. No fatality has ever been reported in connection with acute  cannabis intoxication either in Switzerland or elsewhere. Deaths overall are  very rare following cannabis consumption, and are generally a consequence of the  potentially increased inclination to suicide associated with an atypical course  of intoxication (Hagers Handbuch [...] 1992). Use of high- dose cannabis  products can lead to psychotic states which manifest as a combination of  emotional symptoms, such as fluctuating mood, disorientation and schizophrenia-  like states, and depression, anxiety, visual and auditory hallucinations and  paranoid persecution mania. Panic reactions are often due to the individual's  fear of losing control or his/ her mind. The treatment of such states often  involves nothing more than reassuring the person. Drug therapy is generally  unnecessary because the calming effect of the drug in any case comes to the fore  as the intoxication subsides (Hagers Handbuch [...] 1992; Hollister 1986). When  evaluating the significance of the potential negative effects of cannabis  consumption mentioned above, it should not be forgotten that similar effects may  also occur in patients using many of the psychoactive medications prescribed  today.</p>
<p>Relationship between plasma concentration and degree of intoxication A number  of studies have attempted to correlate plasma concentrations of 9 -THC and its  metabolites with the psychoactive effects of cannabis in order to deduce the  extent of the intoxicated state currently being experienced by an individual, or  to determine when cannabis was last used. However, this is far more difficult  than with alcohol because of the many factors that affect the pharmacological  action of cannabis. Peak plasma concentrations do not correspond to the point of  maximum intoxication when cannabis is inhaled (smoked), injected intravenously  or ingested (eaten or drunk) (Cochetto et al, 1981). More recent mathematical  models are thought to permit more accurate assessment of the time that has  elapsed since cannabis was last consumed (WHO 1997).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.5 Cannabis and driving">2.3.5 Cannabis and driving</a></strong></p>
<p>Of particular interest in view of the widespread use of cannabis is its  effect on the individual's ability to drive and operate machinery. Numerous  studies of the effects of cannabis on psychomotor function and analysis of road  traffic accidents following which THC and/ or alcohol have been detected in the  plasma have produced inconsistent results. The most important aspect is how long  cannabis is likely to affect the ability to drive after it has been taken. The  reduced reaction speed and altered perception, alertness and ability to process  information mean that cannabis is likely to impair the ability to drive as much  as two to four hours after being smoked (up to a maximum of eight hours) (Adams,  Martin 1996; Hollister 1986; Iten 1994; WHO 1997). It has been reported that  cannabis users often overestimate the effect of cannabis on their ability to  drive, and often drive slowly with great concentration, while individuals under  the influence of alcohol tend to overestimate their driving skills (Adams,  Martin 1996). However, it has also been noted that in 80 percent of road traffic  accidents involving THC in the plasma alcohol had also been consumed (WHO 1997).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.6 Medical uses of THC and cannabis">2.3.6 Medical uses of THC  and cannabis</a></strong></p>
<p>The therapeutic use of the pharmacological effects of cannabis and THC in  medicine is the central theme of Chapter 2.5.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.7 Effects of chronic cannabis use">2.3.7 Effects of chronic  cannabis use</a></strong></p>
<p>Opinions differ, in some cases widely, on the effects of chronic cannabis  use, and the results obtained from research to date leave room for assumptions  and speculation. It appears to be practically impossible to demonstrate effects  due solely to cannabis. It is difficult to extrapolate from animal experiments,  some of which use high doses of pure substance and whose duration is too short  to be comparable with chronic use of marijuana, to man. Even in clinical trials  with chronic cannabis users, the results will be falsified for example, if the  individuals studied have been consuming alcohol and tobacco for the same length  of time. For this reason it is not possible to attribute the results solely to  the use of cannabis with any degree of certainty. Moreover, the number of other  possible causes of the effects observed grows as the duration of use gets longer  (WHO 1997).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.7.1 The Amotivational syndrome">2.3.7.1 The Amotivational  syndrome</a></strong></p>
<p>Acute, reversible psychotic states have been documented in exceptional cases  following cannabis use, but the existence of "the amotivational syndrome", first  described in the literature in 1968, has never been confirmed. The term was used  to describe the changes in attitude and personality, the neglect of appearance  and general disinterest displayed by chronic users of cannabis, although  nowadays it is considered to be obsolete and not typical of cannabis consumption  (Huw 1993; WHO 1997). It is exceptionally difficult – if not impossible – to  establish a direct and exclusive causality between speculative consequences of  chronic cannabis use and the drug itself. For example, studies attempting to  link dropping out of school at an early age with cannabis use have tended to  show that it was in fact the family background, the child's relationship with  its parents during its school years, social values, etc. which led the child to  stop going to school (Hollister 1986).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.7.2 Dependence and tolerance">2.3.7.2 Dependence and  tolerance</a></strong></p>
<p>Cannabis consumption can lead to psychological dependence; it is estimated  that around half of heavy users develop dependence of this type (WHO, 1997). In  a German study, one in five respondents admitted to frequently or very  frequently consuming more cannabis than they had intended to (Kleiber et al  1997). The tendency to develop physical dependence is only weak. It has been  demonstrated in animal experiments by administering an antidote (the receptor  antagonist SR 141716A) following chronic administration of cannabis and  observing withdrawal symptoms (Aceto et al 1995). Abrupt withdrawal in humans  following heavy daily consumption produces autonomic withdrawal symptoms such as  nausea, perspiration, trembling, insomnia and loss of appetite (Hollister 1986;  Wiesbeck et al 1996). These symptoms regress following renewed administration of  cannabis, an observation that corroborates the development of dependence (Adams,  Martin 1996). The the dependence profile is classified by the World Health  Organization as a distinctive type of dependence, known as cannabis- type  dependence.</p>
<p>The development of tolerance is associated with pharmacodynamic changes.  Chronic administration of THC has been shown to reduce the number of receptor  binding sites (Rodriguez de Fonseca et al 1994), although this appears to be  reversible (Westlake et al 1991). The tolerance to the functional and  psychological effects of THC observed in animal experiments has also been  demonstrated in man, but does not lead the individual to increase the dose of  cannabis (Beardsley et al 1986; Hollister 1986). Clear tolerance development has  been demonstrated with respect to mood swings, elevated heart rate and  impairment of psychomotor functions. The conditions under which tolerance and  dependence develop – high doses of THC over a long period – do not correspond to  the widespread recreational use of cannabis, and this is why these properties of  cannabis do not present a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.7.3 Carcinogenic effect">2.3.7.3 Carcinogenic effect</a></strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is probably the most widely smoked substance in the world after  tobacco. In addition to the nicotine in tobacco and the cannabinoids in  cannabis, the matter inhaled from both substances contains a large number of  other compounds which irritate the respiratory tract and have carcinogenic  (cancer- causing) properties (Julien 1997). The effects of tobacco and cannabis  on the respiratory system are very probably not additive (WHO 1997), or in other  words they cannot simply be added together. However, the cannabis smoker inhales  more deeply than the tobacco smoker, allowing four times the quantity of tar to  enter the lungs (Hagers Handbuch [...] 1992). Bronchial irritation and  inflammation, reduced macrophage and cilia activity (making the removal of  particles from the lungs more difficult) and changes to the mucous lining of the  respiratory tract have been observed in heavy users of hashish (Hollister 1986;  Julien 1997). In general, studies of longstanding cannabis smokers have  demonstrated damage to the mucosa in the trachea and bronchi (WHO 1997). Smoking  cannabis products is therefore assumed to be associated with an increased risk  of lung and bronchial cancers. However, it is difficult to consider the  carcinogenicity of cannabis in the lung in isolation because hashish and  marijuana smokers are usually also cigarette smokers as well – quite apart from  the fact that these two cannabis products are generally smoked in a mixture with  tobacco anyway (Hagers Handbuch [...] 1992).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.7.4 Genetic effects and effects on reproduction and pregnancy">2.3.7.4  Genetic effects and effects on reproduction and pregnancy</a></strong></p>
<p>An increased rate of chromosomal abnormalities, mainly chromosome breaks and  translocations, has been observed among marijuana smokers (Hollister 1986).  Changes at the cellular level were reversible in clinical trials (WHO 1997). The  clinical significance of these observations is disputed, not least because  similar changes can occur in individuals taking commonly prescribed drugs on a  daily basis (Hollister 1986; Maykut 1985).</p>
<p>The effects on the concentration of testosterone, estrogen and prolactin in  plasma observed in animal experiments have not been reproduced unequivocally in  clinical trials with humans (WHO 1997). In women, cannabis consumption leads to  lower levels of follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone  (LH), and may affect the menstrual cycle, although these effects are evidently  reversible and disappear once the drug is discontinued (Hollister 1986; Maykut  1985).</p>
<p>The good lipid solubility of the cannabinoids allows them to cross the  placenta with ease, and they can be recovered from the fetus after just a few  minutes. Animal experiments investigating the effects of cannabis consumption  during pregnancy have produced varying results. A major study of 12,000 women,  11 percent of whom used marijuana, found shorter gestation periods, longer  deliveries, lower birthweights and a higher rate of deformities (Hollister 1986;  WHO 1997). However, the impact of cannabis on birthweight is minor compared to  the effect of cigarette smoking during pregnancy. Apart from these physical  aspects, the possibility cannot be excluded that cannabis may affect the  behavior and cognitive functions (e. g. learning ability) of the child.  Accordingly, the use of cannabis during pregnancy should be restricted as  systematically as the consumption of alcohol and smoking (Hagers Handbuch [...]  1992; Hollister 1986).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.3.7.5 Effects on the immune system">2.3.7.5 Effects on the  immune system</a></strong></p>
<p>Animal experiments and cell cultures have shown cannabinoids to affect B and  T lymphocytes (e. g. increased susceptibility to infection), although these  effects were not pronounced, were fully reversible, and were induced only by  very high concentrations in excess of those used by individuals to achieve  psychotropic effects (Adams, Martin 1996; Hollister 1986; WHO 1997).</p>
<p>The human immune system is relatively resistant to the immunosuppressive  effects of the cannabinoids, and the research carried out so far supports the  therapeutic use of 9 -THC even in patients whose immune system has been  compromised by other diseases (AIDS, cancer).</p>

<p><strong><a name="2.4 Historical and sociocultural aspects">2.4 Historical and  sociocultural aspects</a></strong></p>
<p>Hemp is an old crop that has been used by man for centuries in many and  varied ways. It was native to Switzerland for hundreds of years, and in fact was  indispensable in many areas of agriculture and for commercial and industrial  products. This background has largely been forgotten since hemp developed a  stigma as a "narcotic substance" in the 1920s. During the 1960s and 70s, this  very versatile traditional fibrous plant was increasingly perceived as nothing  more than a substance capable of inducing hallucinations and other abnormal  states of mind – worshipped by a minority and rejected categorically by the  majority. It was only recently that the image of hemp has been rehabilitated  through awareness that it is a renewable raw material with many ecological  advantages. However, the contradiction between two apparently irreconcilable  components persists: hemp as a valuable and ecologically friendly crop on the  one hand, and cannabis as an exotic drug on the other. Sources date cannabis as  one of the oldest and most widely cultivated crops in the world (Katalyse  Institut 1995; Herer 1993). It had an enormous range of uses (Katalyse Institut  1995; Scheerer 1989). In China, for example, it was used 6,000 years ago to make  food, clothing, fishing nets, oil and medicines (Scheerer 1989; Emboden 1982).  Cannabis spread from central Asia and subsequently featured in all the cultures  in the Middle East, Asia Minor, India, China, Japan, Europe and Africa. Hemp was  introduced to the American continent by Spanish seafarers in 1545; the English  later brought their European knowledge to the colonies (Katalyse Institut 1995).  The hemp plant was used widely to provide fiber and oil and was processed into  food and medicines; its consciuosness- altering properties were used both in  religious rituals and on an everyday basis (Herer 1993). At a slightly later  date hemp was used to make paper: China started in the 1st century BC, Europe  around 1200. At the end of the 19th century, 75 percent of all the paper  produced in the world was made from hemp (Bröckers 1988). This varied and  widespread use – hemp growing was made compulsory in some parts of America in  the 17th and 18th centuries – is contrasted starkly with the decline of cannabis  from the 19th century onward (Katalyse- Institut 1995). Hemp cultivation was  still pursued in the early part of the industrial era in continental Europe, but  competition from Russia was already having a serious impact, and cotton imports  were increasingly destroying the market for hemp fiber. In western Europe more  and more arable land was given over to cereals and animal fodder (Bischof 1994).  In Switzerland, hemp was grown for domestic use only from the mid- 19th century,  and by the start of the 20th century it had practically disappeared from the  landscape. Many authors in the 19th and 20th centuries lamented the decline of  hemp cultivation, blaming it on the population's lack of diligence and  inadequate processing methods. Social and agrarian reformers praised hemp as a  possible source of income for the impoverished classes. It is particularly clear  from the writings of the time that hemp cultivation was seen as a means of  underpinning a traditional way of life and values, and was thus thought to have  a stabilizing function. In Germany, too, hemp cultivation started to decline  before the First World War, although interest surged again during both World  Wars since Germany was largely cut off from the world fiber market and was  dependent on hemp to meet its needs (Katalyse Institut 1995). An interesting  feature in this connection is the "jolly hemp book" issued by the National  Socialists, which portrayed hemp as a reliable native raw material indispensable  in industry and the home. But America also stylized hemp as the savior of the  nation, not least in a hemp propaganda film entitled "Hemp for Victory"  (Bröckers 1988). In Switzerland, a "cultivation campaign" was announced in 1940  under the auspices of Federal Councilor Wahlen; the objective was also to  promote the production of hemp, although the area under cultivation was in fact  small (Tobler 1950). After the Second World War hemp fibers were replaced by  synthetic fibers, hemp oil by mineral oil, lamplight by electric light.  Synthetic drugs proved to be more effective than cannabis, the petrochemical  industry obviated the need for hemp as a pressing material, and wood fiber  replaced hemp in paper manufacture. The significance of this once indispensable  source of fiber declined in the face of the difficulties associated with  mechanizing the harvesting and processing of the plant (Tobler 1950). It was by  no means chance that the materials competing against hemp were easy to integrate  into the industrialization process. One of the aims of competitors was most  certainly to stigmatize hemp. The economic decline of hemp was accompanied by an  increase in prohibition worldwide. After the interwar period, hashish, marijuana  and people who used these substances were increasingly criminalized. In the  1930s the American timber industry sponsored a financially motivated campaign  against marijuana, culminating in 1937 in the passing of the Marijuana Tax Act  in the USA (Scheerer 1989). Before this, in 1925, the Second Opium Conference  had placed hashish on a controlled list of narcotic substances. In 1929 it  became illegal under German law to trade in or use "Indian hemp and more  specifically its resin" (Katalyse Institut 1995); Switzerland followed in 1951,  incorporating a ban into its amendment of the Swiss Narcotics Act (Länzlinger  1997). The point at which cannabis also started to be used in central Europe as  a hallucinogen, and the extent to which it has been used, is still unclear  (Scheerer 1989). Scheerer claims that the overriding purpose of hemp cultivation  in this geographical region has always been to provide fibers and oil (Scheerer  1989). This view is upheld by Swiss sources from the 19th and 20th centuries.  Descriptions of Swiss agriculture portray hemp as a source of fibrous raw  material which was processed mainly into textiles. Some sources mention that the  plant emitted an intoxicating odor, although this was in no case perceived as  dangerous. It was known that a different type of hemp, Cannabis indica, with  narcotic properties existed in the "Orient", but the native species, Cannabis  sativa, was not associated with such effects. The use of the plant as a  hallucinogenic, mind- altering substance was considered as behavior typical of  "Orientals". This perception resulted from a general trend of the era: since the  18th century, the Orient had been perceived as the incarnation of everything  that was "different" from the west, as an alternative to the sober rationality  of the "Occident" that stimulated the western imagination. In the early 20th  century the Pharmacological Institute in Berne carried out a series of  experiments which showed that the effects of Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica  were certainly comparable, but this finding did not give rise to any concern.  The native plant seemed to be safe from "abuse". Hemp was also used in Europe  and America for medicinal purposes; this aspect will be considered in Chapter  2.5. If we consider the typology of cannabis users at various points in time, we  find that cannabis has been, and continues to be, used by very different groups  for different purposes. For a long time, hemp was associated with the poor;  those who couldn't afford tobacco smoked hemp (Kessler 1984). Solidarity within  a subculture and working and smoking together were elements important to those  who used hemp (Tanner 1996); hemp was an expression of a traditional way of life  which may also have been viewed as a form of resistance against the imperatives  of economic modernization and commercialization. In the 1840s, the Club des  Hachichins in Paris embodied the use of hemp, associated with an alternative,  oriental culture, as a positive contrast to the regular, bourgeois way of life.  This gave hemp a new image; it was no longer seen as a way of upholding  tradition but as rejection of normality. The narcotic substance decried by  regular citizens was thought to transport users to a new level of consciousness  and perception and to stimulate artistic productivity (Tanner 1996). In this way  the Bohemians' defense of hemp involuntarily provided the arguments that were  used to make the "drug" taboo, although this was by no means their intention  (Rudgley 1993). The users of the substance at the time formed a relatively  homogeneous group, although subsequently the group came to be larger,  heterogeneous and difficult to define (Bröckers 1988). The criminalization of  cannabis in Switzerland from 1951 did not have the desired effect. With  hindsight, it is much more likely to have contributed to making the plant and  its use into a symbol of peace and tolerance. The stigmatization of cannabis  served to highlight its existence and to popularize it in subcultural settings  (v. Wolffersdorff- Ehlert 1989). The use of cannabis was initially centered on  the so- called beat generation and was not particularly widespread (v.  Wolffersdorff- Ehlert 1989); from about 1964 it became more common in industrial  countries, reaching its first high point in the legendary "summer of love" in  1967. In Switzerland there has been a marked increase in the number of offenses  involving narcotic substances since 1970, although this was probably due more to  the low level of tolerance by the police and the courts than to a sudden surge  in consumption. The media reported a "wave of drugs" said to be submerging the  country. A "war" or "crusade" was mounted against the dangerous substances in an  attempt to kill demand, but the number of users increased unabated. Harder drugs  such as heroin and cocaine started to make more of an appearance, and from about  1974 the focus shifted away from hashish users to people dependent on hard drugs  and "drug fatalities". Cannabis use expanded into a mass phenomenon in the  shadow of this new focus. However, this more widespread consumption also gave  rise to a tendency for people to individualize their use of cannabis in order to  forget their personal frustrations, leaving the collective experiment behind  them (v. Wolffersdorff- Ehlert 1989). The consumption of hemp, although outlawed  in 1975, has normalized and become a commercial proposition, resulting in a  growing disparity between the legal norm and judicial practice. Twenty years  ago, using cannabis products was exotic and something of an adventure for the  adolescents of the day, but in recent years it has become almost normal for many  of them. Today young people of 14 can talk quite openly among themselves or with  trusted adults about their drug use, and those who do not use cannabis, for  example, are tolerant of occasional smokers. It is interesting to note that the  use of various drugs is determined to a very large extent by the habits of the  group that is currently "in" (which may be a school or an entire suburb, or  people involved in a certain type of sport). Trends of this type are open to  very little intervention on the part of parents or guardians. Years ago there  was still a clear distinction between adolescents who drank alcohol and those  who smoked cannabis, with the two groups generally having little to do with each  other. This distinction has blurred increasingly. The single- substance  "cultures" still exist of course, but many adolescents consume both alcohol and  cannabis depending on the situation and availability. This intermingling of two  formerly separate "cultures" is increasingly rendering obsolete the question of  the extent to which cannabis consumption is open to social integration. In the  current situation, cannabis has become an integral part of the social reality of  a not inconsiderable part of the population. Cannabis use has changed from  something originally intended to achieve a "high" and a particular emotional  state into a recreational activity pursued purely for the pleasure of it.  Against this background, it is difficult for people who consume a small amount  of cannabis for relaxation purposes – in the same way that social drinkers  consume alcohol – to understand why cannabis is referred to as a narcotic drug.  As with any psychoactive substance, of course, there are adolescents and adults  who seek refuge from the reality of a situation which, for them, is intolerable.  It is this group which deserves special attention. On the other hand, there is a  current resurgence of interest in hemp as a renewable raw material, and many  traditional uses for the plant have been rediscovered. Cannabis is once again  being used in medicine, with some success (the therapeutic use of cannabis is  described in detail in Chapter 2.5). The ecological advantages of hemp are  particularly evident in comparison with cotton, a crop which is susceptible to  insect pests and thus contains pesticide residues (Katalyse- Institut 1995), but  also in comparison with wood because hemp grows much faster. Switzerland now has  a hemp support project run by the Federal Office of Agriculture (Bischof 1994).  This project threw into sudden and sharp focus the traditions and expertise  which had been lost with the demise of hemp cultivation. Seeds had to be  imported from Hungary and France, and the techniques for growing the plant had  to be relearnt (Bischof 1994). Overall there is growing interest in hemp  cultivation and products made from hemp.</p>

<p><strong><a name="2.5 The medical importance of cannabis">2.5 The medical  importance of cannabis</a></strong></p>
<p>Note on this chapter: This report is concerned primarily with the use of  cannabis as a recreational drug. Whether cannabis products can be used  beneficially in the medical treatment of patients is a completely different  question which must be considered separately from both a technical and a legal  point of view. However, Chapter 2.5.2 provides a brief summary of the current  state of knowledge, and the conclusions at the end of this report will also  touch on this aspect. The paragraphs printed in italics and smaller typeface are  intended for those with a special interest in this field and may be omitted  without fear of losing the context.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.5.1 Introduction">2.5.1 Introduction</a></strong></p>
<p>The first written evidence of cannabis being used in medicine is probably a  Chinese handbook of botany and healing some 4,700 years old. Cannabis was  mentioned in herbals from the 16th century. It was used in popular medicine from  the time of the first crusade and featured in the medicine practiced by monks in  many monasteries. It was used to treat rheumatic and bronchial disorders, and  was also prescribed generally as a substitute for opium. In the 19th century it  was also a popular treatment for migraine, neuralgia, epileptiform convulsions,  insomnia and other conditions. Marijuana was the most commonly used pain killer  in America until 1898, when it was faced with stiff competition from Aspirin and  was ultimately replaced by a wide range of new, synthetic medications. Between  1842 and 1900, cannabis preparations accounted for half of all medicines sold in  America (Herer 1993). More than 100 different cannabis- based medicines were  available in Europe, most of them in Switzerland as well, between 1850 and 1950  (Fankhauser 1996). Difficulty in dosing these preparations, paradoxical effects  and the development of more effective products led to a decline in prescriptions  for cannabis even before prohibition finally put an end to its use (Mikuriya  1973, Mikuriya 1982, Springer 1982). Today doctors are not allowed to prescribe  cannabis or cannabinoids (the legal situation is explained in Chapter 2.6.4.3).  Scientific research involving cannabis requires a special license from the Swiss  Federal Office of Public Health. The Paraplegic Center in Basel is currently  running a study to investigate dronabinol in the treatment of painful muscle  spasms in paraplegics; initial results are promising. <br />Below is a brief  summary of two medical aspects of cannabis: <br />- A review of the major  scientific findings relating to the therapeutic use of cannabis ( 9  tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and synthetic cannabis products);<br />- An overview of  medical experience with cannabis poisoning in acute medical care.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.5.2 Investigation of the therapeutic action of cannabis">2.5.2  Investigation of the therapeutic action of cannabis</a></strong></p>
<p>In recent years, the prescription of cannabis and cannabis- based active  principles for therapeutic purposes has become a recurrent and growing focus of  scientific, medical and political interest. Some countries permit cannabis to be  prescribed under various conditions, usually for medical trials or on a named-  patient basis; a treatment regimen for a distinct indication has been  established only in very few cases. The only indications for which dronabinol  (delta- 9- THC) has received regulatory approval for routine use to date are to  stimulate appetite in AIDS patients and to control nausea and vomiting in  patients undergoing chemotherapy in whom other drugs have proven ineffective.  Dronabinol was launched in the USA in 1986 under the name Marinol and has since  been approved in Canada (1990), Australia (1995), Israel and South Africa. It is  available for license in Germany, Belgium, Japan and Switzerland (Kleiner and  Kovar 1998).</p>
<p>In 1997 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA reviewed the  available literature on the therapeutic value of cannabis and the need for  further research. The information below is based on the expert report  subsequently submitted to the NIH (Beaver et al 1997). A further summary has  been complied by Gowing et al (1998).</p>
<p><strong>Pain management:</strong> Two controlled studies of patients with cancer pain  were carried out with oral THC vs. placebo. Although THC had an analgesic  effect, it was difficult to dose because of the very narrow therapeutic window  between ineffective underdosing and the adverse effects associated with  overdosage. No studies have been carried out with smoked or otherwise inhaled  cannabis.</p>
<p><strong>Neurological disorders:</strong> There is evidence that cannabis is effective  against the spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and has a certain  potential in the treatment of epilepsy, but no clinical studies have been  carried out in either indication. Cannabis has proved ineffective in attempts to  treat Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in cancer patients:</strong> THC  administered orally is more effective than placebo but less effective than drugs  such as metoclopramide. The relative efficacy of oral THC or smoked marijuana  compared with newer anti- emetics has not been studied. Dronabinol is authorized  in the USA for patients in whom conventional therapy to counter nausea and  vomiting is ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Glaucoma:</strong> Local administration of THC reduces intraocular pressure in  healthy subjects and glaucoma patients without affecting blood pressure or mood.  The mechanism of action is unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Cachexia (wasting associated with serious illness):</strong> Clinical studies  have demonstrated a connection between cannabis use and increased appetite in  healthy subjects. THC can bring about weight gain in wasted AIDS and cancer  patients. Dronabinol is approved in the US for the treatment of AIDS- related  anorexia.</p>
<p><strong>Further research</strong> is recommended in all these indications. In  particular, controlled clinical trials are needed which focus both on  pharmaceutical products and on smoked cannabis.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.5.3 Cannabis poisoning in medical emergency statistics">2.5.3  Cannabis poisoning in medical emergency statistics</a></strong></p>
<p>A completely different aspect of any medical evaluation of cannabis must be  the experience gained with acute intoxications encountered in critical care  situations. There are no systematic medical statistics documenting cases of  acute poisoning and their outcome, but the figures compiled by the Swiss  Toxicology Information Center and studies carried out by two hospital emergency  departments (Berne and St. Gallen) provide a good indication of the current  situation.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.5.3.1 Swiss Toxicology Information Center">2.5.3.1 Swiss  Toxicology Information Center</a><br /></strong>In 1997 the Swiss Toxicology  Information Center handled 87 enquiries about cannabis poisoning (66 in 1996 and  60 in 1995). Between 70 and 75 percent of these cases involved simple  intoxication with cannabis, between 25 and 30 percent involved another substance  as well. Of the enquiries received, 60 percent came from doctors, 40 percent  from lay people. More detailed analysis only started in 1997. Of the cases of  simple intoxication, two had an asymptomatic course, eight involved moderately  severe symptoms and one involved severe symptoms. All the patients survived.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2. 5. 3.2 Clinical trials in Switzerland">2.5.3.2 Clinical trials  in Switzerland</a></strong></p>
<p>a) Study in Berne<br />A retrospective study analyzed all the cases of acute  intoxication with illegal drugs admitted to the emergency department of the  Inselspital Hospital in Berne during a 183- day period in 1989 and 1990. The  study covered a total of 157 patients, among whom cannabis featured fewer than  four times (&lt; 1.6 percent) in combination with another substance. A total of  257 different substances were recorded for these patients. Cannabis showed no  dangerous effects in this study.</p>
<p>b) Study in St. Gallen<br />A five- year prospective study (1993 - 1997) of  20,220 medical emergencies at St. Gallen cantonal hospital showed that  intoxication with cannabis alone accounted for just three emergencies. This is  equivalent to 0.015 percent of all medical emergencies. All three patients  presented to the out- patients department with mild mental disturbances. The  symptoms regressed spontaneously within a short time in all patients. Cannabis  was detected in a total of 21 patients (0. 1 percent of all medical  emergencies), three times as the sole cause of poisoning, once in combination  with other illegal drugs, and 14 times in combination with illegal drugs,  prescribed medication and alcohol. There were no deaths or serious complications  related to cannabis.</p>

Cannabis in Switzerland: The current situation 2.6 The legal environment <!-- Mirrored from www.drugtext.org/library/reports/swisscan/2.6.htm by HTTrack Website Copier/3.x [XR&CO'2005], Tue, 05 Apr 2005 20:39:34 GMT --><!-- Mirrored from www.drugtext.org/library/reports/swisscan/2.6.htm by HTTrack Website Copier/3.x [XR&CO'2005], Mon, 04 Jul 2005 21:15:35 GMT --></p>
<p><strong><a name="2.6 The legal environment ">2.6 The legal environment </a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="2.6.1 International conventions">2.6.1 International  conventions</a></strong></p>
<p>A significant factor in the policy debate over cannabis – as is also true in  the case of other substances classified as narcotic drugs – is the fact that the  scope for national legislation is curtailed to some extent by obligations  entered into under various international agreements (for a complete and  exhaustive account of international drug law see Rausch 1991: page 107 to 136).  Several conventions have been drawn up in order to regulate the abuse and  trafficking of illegal substances. These international conventions have been  ratified by numerous countries and to some extent shape their national  legislation directly. Among the matters covered by these conventions is cannabis  consumption. A milestone in the development of international drugs law was the  Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961. This laid down rules of  international application and largely superseded a number of existing  conventions, agreements and protocols which were incomplete in their coverage.  To this day the Single Convention forms the cornerstone of most countries’  national drugs legislation. It requires ratifying States to promulgate laws  giving effect within their territories to the measures recommended in the  Convention (HugBeeli 1995: page 146). The Single Convention places cannabis and  cannabis resin in the same category as opiates (e. g. heroin), in Schedule IV.  It classifies substances hierarchically according to their medical utility and  carries on a distinction between the useful substances of the West (medicines)  and traditional substances of the Orient having no therapeutic value (Richard  1995: page 18). However, with the emergence of new, chemically manufactured  substances in the seventies the Single Convention soon began to appear outdated.  As a consequence, a new international agreement was adopted to cover these new  synthetic products. This was the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971,  also known as the Vienna Convention. It places synthetic products in the  category of 'psychotropic substances’ (psychopharmaceuticals, barbiturates,  LSD). The Convention permits their use in medicine but otherwise prohibits  consumption. 1 The main active constituent of cannabis (delta-  9tetrahydrocannabinol) is included among the stimulants (e. g. amphetamine) in  Table II (psychotropic substances), which means it is subject to the same level  of controls as narcotic drugs under the Single Convention. The residual mix of  active ingredients in cannabis, on the other hand, is included in Table I under  hallucinogens, which may be used solely for scientific and – to a limited degree  – medicinal purposes under individual licenses issued by the authorities. In  1972 there followed the Protocol Amending the Single Convention, which defines  the functions of the International Narcotics Control Board. This body works in  cooperation with governments to ensure that only such quantities of narcotic  drugs are cultivated, produced or used as are necessary for medicinal and  scientific purposes (Hug- Beeli 1995: page 147). The most recent convention is  the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and  Psychotropic Substances 2 of 1988, which further extends the scope of  international drugs law. Unlike the Single Convention and the Vienna Convention,  3 this convention expressly requires signatory countries to prohibit the  activities preparatory to personal consumption. It does not require the actual  consumption of illegal substances to be made an offence, only their possession  and procurement (Hug- Beeli 1995: page 148). The Convention permits these  substances to be used in medicine but otherwise prohibits all consumption.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.6.2 The Federal Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Act (BetmG; SR 812.121)">2.6.2  The Federal Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Act (BetmG; SR  812.121)</a></strong></p>
<p>The Federal Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Act (BetmG) of 1951, as  amended in 1974, regulates the production, distribution, purchase and use of  narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which are subject to State controls.  Within the meaning of the law, narcotic drugs include addictive substances and  compounds of the cannabinoid type (Article 1( 1) BetmG). By way of example, in  the second paragraph of the same Article, hemp is specified as a raw material of  narcotic drugs. The resin of the glandular hair of the hemp plant (known as  'hashish’) is also listed as an active constituent of cannabis. Under Article 8(  1) BetmG, neither hemp plants used for the purpose of producing narcotic drugs  nor hashish may be cultivated, imported, produced or placed on the market. Hemp  may be freely cultivated for other purposes, however, without any special permit  being required. Article 4 BetmG, which provides that a permit is required for  the production of narcotic substances, does not apply in the case of hemp. 5 .  Under Article 1( 2) c and d BetmG, narcotic substances also include 'other  substances’ having a similar effect to hemp or the resin of its glandular hair  and 'preparations’ containing any of the 'substances’ already mentioned. Hemp  products are thus by definition narcotic substances. Whether Article 8( 1) d  BetmG actually extends the criterion of narcotics production to hemp products  ['the following narcotic substances may not be cultivated, imported, produced or  placed on the market: d) hemp for the purpose of narcotics production or the  resin of its glandular hair (hashish) ’] is an open question, which has not yet  been definitively resolved by the courts. The current position therefore appears  to be that the production and supply of cannabis products such as cannabis oil  etc. are not subject to any restriction whatsoever under the drugs legislation  unless the motive is the production of narcotic drugs (see Annex d to the Order  of the Federal Office for Public Health on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic  Substances, BetmV- BAG, SR 812.121.1). Under the first subparagraph of Article  19( 1) BetmG it is a criminal offence to cultivate hemp without authorization,  where it is done for the purpose of producing narcotic drugs. Otherwise, the  penal provisions of the BetmG draw no distinction between cannabis and the other  narcotic drugs and make both illicit trafficking and consumption an offence.  Since the decision of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court of 29 August 1991, 6 the  legal position is that, according to the present state of knowledge, cannabis,  even in large quantities, 'cannot endanger the health of many individuals’  within the meaning of Article 19( 2) a BetmG. Any offence contrary to the first  subparagraph of Article 19( 1) BetmG, which concerns cannabis, cannot therefore  be treated as 'a serious case’ within the meaning of Article 19( 2) a BetmG.  Trafficking in cannabis products, unlike other drugs such as LSD, heroin or  cocaine, is thus capable of being treated as a 'serious case’ (carrying a  minimum sentence upon conviction of one year’s imprisonment) only if it is  organized by a gang or carried on as a business. The consumption of hashish,  however, will not automatically be treated as a 'minor case’ in accordance with  Article 19a( 2) BetmG. It cannot be treated as such in the case of somebody who  is a regular user of hashish and has no intention of changing this behavior. 7  For minor offences of cannabis trafficking and consumption the approach varies  from canton to canton. 8 The courts have been tending to take a more lenient  approach to sentencing for offences of personal consumption. In some cantons  there are even places (meeting points, small venues) where cannabis is freely  consumed or sold in small quantities. Ten of the 26 cantons also confirm that  their police forces adopt a different approach to drug law enforcement where  cannabis is concerned, as opposed to other illegal substances, and tend to turn  a blind eye to consumption offences (see Fahrenkrug et al 1995: page 143).  According to the results of special surveys carried out by the Swiss Federal  Statistical Office 9 of court decisions 10 in drugs cases in the years 1991 and  1994, cannabis products were the substances most frequently involved in  convictions for drug use, especially where the person before the court was a  minor (in 95 percent (1991) and 91 percent (1994) of cases where a minor was  convicted on a drugs charge). These rates fall to 65 percent and 51 percent in  the case of adults. In cases where no criminal conviction is entered in the  records, the most common court orders against persons convicted of mere  consumption of cannabis are fines, followed by censures or cautions.</p>

<p><strong><a name="2.6.3 The Swiss Road Traffic Act">2.6.3 The Swiss Road Traffic  Act</a></strong></p>
<p>An aspect of cannabis consumption which merits special attention is the  scientific debate over the issue of driving under the influence of psychotropic  substances. Here again there are divergent views. There are studies which show  cannabis to cause negative effects on driving performance (reduction of capacity  to adapt during difficult maneuvers (cited in Bühringer et al 1993: page 9).  Other studies have failed to detect any significant effect on motor functions  and reaction time (cited in Hug- Beeli 1995: page 556). It is true overall that  both the excessive consumption of alcohol or other psychotropic substances and  their consumption in combination can impair driving performance. An Australian  report by Hall et al (1992: page vii) found that drivers with THC in the blood  drove more cautiously and had a lower propensity to take risks than drivers with  alcohol in the blood. In studies on accident victims, however, the presence of  THC in the blood was detected in up to 37 percent of cases, mostly in  combination with an elevated alcohol level. Are cannabis users therefore more  likely to be involved in accidents? The above figures do not provide an answer  since, for one thing, the presence of THC in the blood indicates only that  cannabis was recently consumed and not a cannabis- induced state of inebriation  and, furthermore, the confounding effect of alcohol (in over 75 percent of the  cases covered) makes it difficult to give a conclusive interpretation to the  results 11 . To be on the safe side, a limit could be imposed on cannabis  consumption by drivers, but such a provision would be difficult to put into  practice. First, it is not possible to determine a cut- off point above which  cannabis consumption makes driving dangerous. Secondly, there is no direct  correlation between THC content in the blood and driving performance ( in  contrast to the alcohol level of the blood). These difficulties are reflected in  the Road Traffic Act. In Switzerland, 'driving in a state of drunkenness’, for  example, is a misdemeanor under Article 91( 1) of the Act, whereas being unfit  to drive due to consumption of drugs is merely an infraction, under Article 90(  1), unless it is accompanied by a serious traffic violation within the meaning  of Article 90( 2) (Hug- Beeli 1995: page 561f). However, the law does provide  for the punishment of a person found driving under the influence of illicit  substances 12 . Under the current legislation, the court has discretion to deal  with a case of driving under the influence of illicit substances after taking  into account all the circumstances of the case. 13 In Germany, too, the Cologne  Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court), in a decision given on 24 August  1990, has recognized that there is still insufficient empirical data to show  exactly the impairment of driving performance that occurs following cannabis  consumption (Hug- Beeli 1995: page 565; see also Bühringer et al 1993: page 9).  The Road Traffic Act is currently in the process of being amended. In order to  improve road safety, the proposed amendments are intended to enable more  effective action to be taken against those who drive in an unfit condition. In  the consultation process on the draft amendment, a unanimous welcome was given  to the proposed creation of a federal power to take blood and urine samples from  a driver suspected of being under the influence of narcotics or medication. It  is also proposed to give the Federal Council powers to introduce a zero- limit  for certain substances – narcotic drugs and/ or medicines – deemed to have been  proven to cause unfitness to drive. In the case of all other substances, an  allegation of unfitness to drive would have to be proved in each specific  instance. In relation to this proposal, the question will again arise as to  which category of substances cannabis falls into. The Federal Office for Roads,  in its submission on the proposed legislation, expresses the view that cannabis  can impair driving performance for a period of approximately eight hours  following consumption. It has not been conclusively established to what extent  cannabis consumption can result in flash- backs i. e. episodes of phantom  inebriation following drugfree intervals (BGE 124 II 566).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.6.4 Agricultural and private cultivation">2.6.4 Agricultural  and private cultivation</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="2.6.4.1 Hemp in agriculture">2.6.4.1 Hemp in  agriculture</a><br /></strong>Under the sustainable resources trial being conducted by  the Federal Office of Agriculture, the Federal Government provides subsidies for  the cultivation of low- THC hemp (THC content of less than 0.3 percent) for  industrial use. Hemp cultivation for the production of edible oils, etc., is not  eligible for subsidy since sustainable resources, as defined, may not be used as  foodstuffs for humans or animals (Article 6a( 2) of the Ordinance on Production  Control in Crop Farming). A list of saleable varieties of hemp seed in the  agricultural sector was brought into effect in Switzerland on 1 March 1998. 14  Delivery notes and certificates are used to monitor hemp seed transactions and  the Federal Office of Agriculture carries out tests to determine THC content.  Anybody growing hemp with a THC content in excess of 0.3 percent is liable to  investigation and prosecution. These provisions do not apply directly to hemp  grown for non- agricultural purposes (e. g. as an ornamental plant or house-  plant).</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.6.4.2 Hemp in food, cosmetics and articles of daily use">2.6.4.2 Hemp in  food, cosmetics and articles of daily use</a><br /></strong>Hemp blossoms, seeds,  volatile oil and other plant parts are currently used in food and cosmetics  production. Latterly, a variety of products such as hemp oil, hemp biscuits,  hemp pasta and hemp- blossom- flavored beer have appeared on the market. By law,  foodstuffs may not produce any pharmacological effect. With the amendment of the  Ordinance on Foreign Substances and Ingredients in Food Products (FIV) on 30  January 1998, maximum limits were introduced for the THC content in various  foodstuffs. For example, hemp seed oils containing more than 50mg/ kg no longer  constitute foodstuffs within the meaning of Article 3 of the Food Act. The FIV  amendment came into effect on 15 February 1998. There are no equivalent  regulations in the product categories of cosmetics and articles of daily use.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.6.4.3 Hemp in medicine">2.6.4.3 Hemp in medicine</a><br /></strong>At  both national and international level there is keen interest in the medical use  of the hemp plant or its extracts (see section 2.5). The use of narcotic drugs  for medicinal purposes is regulated by the BetmG. That Act prohibits the  production, supply, possession and consumption of narcotic drugs for non-  medical use, in accordance with Switzerland’s obligations under international  conventions. With the enactment of the BetmG in 1951, the existing general  prohibition on opium was extended in accordance with the recommendation  contained in the International Convention of 19 February 1925 to extend  prohibition to hashish, other than where used for therapeutic purposes. 15 In  the eyes of the legislature of the time, the medical utility of cannabis was  regarded as at best marginal. Today, only scientific research into cannabis i.  e. into its psychoactive constituents, is allowed, subject to authorization  being obtained from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health in accordance with  Article 8( 5) BetmG. However, Article 8( 5) BetmG makes no provision for the  authorization of cannabis for medical use, not even for limited medical use, as  in the case of heroin or hallucinogens. Thus hemp products whose active  constituents produce psychotropic effects cannot at present be used for medical  purposes in Switzerland. Plant extracts such as hemp tinctures or hemp extracts  or other compounds are no longer included in the current lists of the  Intercantonal Office for the Control of Drugs (IKS). The position is somewhat  different in the case of individual active constituents: under the current  legislation they may be used in clinical studies and for limited medical  applications – but subject to stringent conditions. Article 8( 5) BetmG permits  the use of THC in the treatment of a small number of serious cases of  spasticity, which are not treatable with other medicines (severe spasmodic  contractions in paraplegics or tetraplegics or in multiple sclerosis patients).</p>

<p>Hemp has become a dual- use crop, i. e. it may be both consumed as an illicit  narcotic drug (marijuana, hashish) and used legally in agriculture as a  renewable resource for the textiles, oil, paper, rope and building industries,  or for the production of foodstuffs and articles of daily use, or as a medicine.  This duality of lawful and unlawful uses poses major difficulties for the  authorities in policing hemp cultivation and the sale of its various products 16  . From the perspective of the law enforcement agencies the problem lies in the  fact that all varieties of hemp may lawfully be grown provided they are not  grown for the purpose of producing narcotic drugs, with the onus of proving such  intention lying on the prosecution authorities. Similarly, in the case of the  sale of hemp products it is incumbent on the prosecution authorities to adduce  proof that the products in question are prohibited substances having a  psychoactive effect and that the seller has offered the products for sale in  that knowledge. It is virtually impossible for the prosecution authorities to  discharge this burden of proof any more, particularly in relation to the growing  export trade for hemp products, as the final processing and use of the products  takes place abroad. According to police figures, Switzerland is increasingly an  exporter of hemp for use as a drug 17 (see also section 2.2.2)</p>
<p>1 According to Richard (1995, page 19), psychotropic substances as defined  under this Convention include all products capable of causing addiction, which  affect the central nervous system by either stimulating or depressing it or by  causing hallucinations and which, most importantly, engender misuse to the  detriment of society and public health. Also, legal psychotropic substances  (alcohol and tobacco) are not included in the category.</p>
<p>2 This convention has yet to be ratified by the majority of the signatory  states. In Switzerland, the issue of ratification is to be debated after the  referendum on the ‘Droleg initiative’ has been held.</p>
<p>3 Article 36( 1) of the Single Convention only requires the criminalization  of illegal possession in connection with dealing while the Vienna Convention is  also directed against illicit trafficking rather than against the unlawful  consumption of psychotropic substances (see notice and draft resolution of 29  November 1995 on the 1988 Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic  Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (BBl 1996 I, 619).</p>
<p>4. The difficulty of distinguishing between possession and consumption is  briefly discussed below with reference to the case of the United Kingdom.  Suffice for now to observe that the question as to whether possession or  consumption is involved is often left to the discretion of the prosecution  authorities.</p>
<p>5 See the Report of the Swiss Federal Office of Justice of 21 January 1994;  the same conclusion is reached by Seiler in the Legal Opinion on Hemp  Cultivation, page 14, 13 January 1998. 6</p>

<p>8 Hug- Beeli 1995: page 181: 'in Zurich the following practice has become  established over recent years: a first- time hashish user receives a fine of  between SFR 50 and SFR 300 – SFR 100 is the norm – depending on his financial  circumstances. In the case of a repeat conviction for regular use the fine is  increased accordingly, but does not exceed SFR 500. Notorious users may be fined  between SFR 500 and SFR 1000 and in exceptional cases may even receive a  custodial sentence. 'Weekend use’, as it is called, which means taking cannabis  no more than once a week, and consumption on a purely occasional basis, at  parties etc. are either not punished at all or attract merely a caution.</p>

<p>10 Only the decisions not entered in the criminal record give details as to  the type of drugs used (1991: 62 percent and 1994: 78 percent of convictions for  drug use). These findings therefore relate to these decisions and do not provide  an overall picture of the various drugs dealt in or consumed by those convicted.</p>
<p>11 In addition, comparative figures on the incidence of cannabis in the blood  of non- accident victims are lacking. It is therefore not possible to establish  whether cannabis users are proportionately over- represented among accident  victims.</p>

<p><strong><a name="2.7 Enforcement of the existing legislation">2.7 Enforcement of  the existing legislation</a></strong></p>
<p>As shown above in sections 2.2 (availability and trade) and 2.6 (The legal  environment), the duality of licit and illicit uses poses major difficulties for  the regulation of cannabis cultivation and the sale of cannabis products. The  prosecution authorities are required to provide additional evidence as proof  that hemp under cultivation is being grown for the purpose of the illegal  production of narcotic drugs or that hemp on sale is intended for illegal  consumption. Such evidence is often not possible to produce or, where it is,  only at an inordinately high cost in terms of administrative resources. Often  the only means of proof is the evidence of the consumers of the hemp products  themselves. Obtaining such evidence is a time- consuming and expensive process.  Another difficulty for law enforcement officers is the fact that the bulk of the  hemp plant can be channeled into legal uses after harvesting (hemp stems and  leaves for fiber production, hemp seeds for oil production), while the parts  with the highest THC content are used as drugs (flowering tops, fruit and  resin). On 16 October 1998, in a case which attracted widespread notice, the 6  th division of the Zurich Bezirksgericht (District Court) held that the mere  fact of declaring hemp bags as "scented pillows" constituted in itself an  attempt to circumvent the BetmG and that selling these "aromatic pillows" was  the equivalent of dealing in cannabis. Among the grounds relied upon by the  Zurich court in its judgment was the fact that in the case of this product the  element of narcotics production required by the BetmG had already taken place  and the product was capable of being consumed in its present form. The above-  mentioned difficulties together with regional variations in the perception of  the drugs issue lead to substantial disparities from canton to canton in the way  the authorities deal with cannabis users. Even the level of police charges  against consumers of soft drugs is uneven. In a number of French- speaking  cantons and in the canton of Aargau – as the following chart illustrates on the  basis of various examples – the majority of charges brought for drug use  offences concern hashish and marijuana. In the large German- speaking cantons,  in contrast, the police concentrates to a much greater degree on heroin and  cocaine users. Police figures (Swiss Narcotic Drugs Statistics, Federal Office  for Police Matters) indicate that hashish consumption has barely increased in  recent years whereas consumption of marijuana (most of it domestically produced)  has risen sharply. The shift from hashish to marijuana is manifested both in the  number of prosecutions and in the level of seizures.</p>
