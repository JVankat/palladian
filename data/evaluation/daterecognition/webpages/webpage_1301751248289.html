<p>Georgia and Russia are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/world/europe/09georgia.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">careening towards war</a>. And the U.S. isn&#8217;t exactly a detached observer in the fight. The American military has been training and equipping Georgian troops for years.</p>
<p>The news thus far: Georgia, which has been <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/05/drone-wars-part.html">locked in a drone war</a> over the separatist enclave of Abkhazia, has launched an offensive to reclaim another breakaway territory, South Ossetia. Latest reports indicate that Georgian forces are laying siege to Tskhinvali, the South<br />
Ossetian capital. And Russia, which has backed the separatists, is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7548715.stm">sending in the tanks</a>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So why should we care? Oh, just the prospect of a larger regional war that could drag in Russia – and involve the United States as well. Since early 2002, the U.S. government has given a healthy amount of military aid to Georgia. When I last visited South Ossetia, Georgian troops manned a checkpoint outside Tskhinvali &#8212; <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/08/the-new-war-in.html">decked out in surplus U.S. Army uniforms and new body armor</a>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first U.S. aid came under the rubric of the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3430">Georgia<br />
Train and Equip Program</a> (ostensibly to counter alleged Al Qaeda influence in the Pankisi Gorge); then, under the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=16284">Sustainment and Stability Operations Program</a>. Georgia returned the favor, committing thousands of troops to the multi-national coalition in Iraq. Last fall, the<br />
Georgians doubled their contingent, making them the <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1078614.html">third-largest contributor to the coalition</a>. Not bad for a nation of 4.6 million people.<br /> <o:p></o:p><br />Leaving aside the question of Russian interference (see below), the larger concern has been that Georgia might be tempted to use its newfound military prowess to resolve domestic conflicts by force. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> As Sergei Shamba, the foreign affairs minister of Abkhazia, told me in 2006: “The Georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped, trained, that they have gained military experience in Iraq. It feeds this revanchist mood… How can South Ossetia be demilitarized, when all of Georgia is bristling with weaponry, and it’s only an hour’s ride by tank from Tbilisi to Tskhinvali?”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the U.S. military trainers put it to me a bit more bluntly. “We’re giving them the knife,” he said. “Will they use it?”</p>

<p>You do realize this is RUSSIA we&#8217;re talking about here?  They don&#8217;t care about the Ossetians &#8211; all they see is the pipelines running across Georgia (and the oil under the ground).  While a lot of folks whined &#8220;it&#8217;s all about the OIL&#8221; when we went into Iraq (and didn&#8217;t take the oil &#8211; what a shock), this one is REALLY about the oil, and transportation of same.</p>

<p>Without American arms and trainings, what chance at all would the Georgians have at resisting Russian pressure and invasion?  None.  As it stands, they still might have only a small hope of resisting an all-out invasion, but they still might be capable enough to deter a wider invasion.</p>
<p>The Russians, Nathan, have ALWAYS eyed Georgia as a target of control an possession.  You can either naively go into the tired old narrative that the conflict came as a result of Georgians having weapons, or you can brush up on history and geopolitics and realize that something a little bigger is happening here.</p>

To answer the question of this post:</p>
<p>Did the U.S. Prep Georgia for War with Russia?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I would say it was more defensive in nature, than &#8220;for war&#8221;, as the title does seem provacative.</p>
<p>Is Georgia out of line by demanding a military solution to the seperatist region? Possibly.<br />
OTOH, Russia once ruled Georgia, and has wanted it back since they lost control. The situation is complicated, but, to be blunt, there is little doubt that Russia has been working within Georgia to support AND forment the revolution in the South Ossetia.</p>
<p>This is the difference I see for those who would ask the difference between this action, and the US support of Kosovo. The difference being the US was not formenting revolution prior to the Kosovo/Serbia conflict, when again, Russia WAS actively supporting Serbia.</p>
<p>The US should try to lay off as much as possible, and agreed we do need to draw the line, but Russia isn&#8217;t innocent, and the blog post could just as easily be flipped around and titled:</p>
<p>Did Russia Prep  South Ossetia for War with Georgia?</p>
<p>The answer would be yes as well.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say as always, but yes, there does at times tend to be a left of center view espousped by the majority of blog posters for Wired.com blogs. While mum&#8217;s the word on the political end, bloggers in Wired science blogs have readily admitted (I can site specific posts) to it in the past. I don&#8217;t have as much of a problem, as long as it&#8217;s stated explicitly, which it is not.</p>

CNN and BBC as far as i know show the news incorrectly.<br />
Georgia began destroying the Ossetian towns on 7.08 after a couple hours when Saakaschvilly told about peaceful solving problems , interesting ?<br />
8.08 georgian-american soldiers killed about 1500 ossetians and destroyed Tskhinvali fully.<br />
russian tanks came to protect Tskhinvali , because 90% of populatin in ossetia are Russians. Thank God the battle has stopped there..<br />

<p>Georgia may have started the incursion &#8220;first&#8221;, but I would be interested to hear you, or other posters from Russia, respond to some of the other points, including Russia&#8217;s obvious support for Osetiyu revolt PRIOR to today&#8217;s actions.<br />
(Please see my posts above)<br />
If the Russian&#8217;s were not acting in good faith with regards to the peace-keeping force there, it seems a rather moot point as to who was &#8220;first&#8221; here. I have also failed to currently seen evidence of intentional action by Georgia, in regards to civilian targets, although I would not rule it out, nor condone it.</p>

if your nationat neighboors were illegally attacked and cried to help them , would you ?<br />

It is a nascent democracy in an extremely volatile part of the world. It has also contributed in a big way towards establishing an Iraqi state. Why on Earth wouldn&#8217;t we want them as a viable security partner and therefore give them the military assistance to make that happen?</p>
<p>The separatists in SO have continued shelling other Georgian villages even during a unilateral Georgian cease fire. The Georgian government did retaliate in a big way. Perhaps the scale of their action was not justified or fair, but they were moving into Georgian territory.</p>
<p>Russia responds by apparently attacking Georgia by air and most certainly invaded by land. How were they &#8220;dragged&#8221; into it Nathan? They wanted this fight. They have been aiding the separatists since the get. They wanted to force Georgia&#8217;s hand and operating off of a calculus that is entirely unknown to me the Georgians finally decided to take the bait.</p>
<p>Personally I hope we gave them enough to give the Russians enough of a bloody nose to give them a little pause.</p>
<p>And Nathan GTEP started in FY02, but we began our military assistance in FY94 although that was just a trickle. FY01 was the first $10mil year. You may have been aware of that, but you ought to be a bit more precise in your use of language. &#8220;The first U.S. aid came under the rubric of the Georgia Train and Equip Program&#8221; is a demonstrably false statement.<br />

Although I do differ in that I feel restraint is neccessary on the part of the US until the dust settles.<br />
We don&#8217;t need to give the Russian&#8217;s any more ability to cover their a$$e$ with excuses about outside intervention. We prepped Georgia for this possibility (or is it inevitable). Let&#8217;s wait till the dust settles.</p>

<p>FROM WIKIPEDIA:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ghost Recon begins in 2008, with civil unrest in Russia. Ultra-nationalists have seized power in Russia, with plans to rebuild the government. Their first step is clandestine support of rebel factions in Georgia and the Baltic States. This is where the Ghosts come in: to silence the invasion. Armed with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world, the soldiers of the Ghost Recon force are covertly inserted into area of operations and given specific missions to curtail the rebel actions and overthrow their benefactors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only apparently our &#8220;ghosts&#8221;  and our &#8220;spooks&#8221; were not active enough in the region to prevent said rebel actions.</p>

I also know that Gerhard Schroeder and Jokshua Fischer were essentially Russian moles, and did yeoman&#8217;s work in makine Germany far more dependent on Russian energy than it should be (where does Schroeder work now?).</p>
<p>Hey, I don&#8217;t hate Russia for being itself &#8211; power abhors a vacum and all that &#8211; play your little games in Belorus and the less important &#8216;Stans (but watch your border with China very carefully . . .)

<p>What if Mexico made passports available to every person of Mexican ancestry in the US.  Then, they supported and armed a rebellion for an independent Los Angeles nation.  Would the US be justified in trying to assert its sovereignty over LA, even if it came to military force?  Would Mexico be justified to invade the US to protect the break-away Los Angeles republic?</p>
<p>Nearly all honest people would find Mexico to be in the wrong in this case, where Mexico is clearly analogous to Russia.  The major difference is, of course, that instead of Mexico&#8217;s inferior military, Russia is vastly superior in might, which makes the situation even more egregious.</p>
<p>Now, Kosovo is sometimes mentioned, but that argument is a wash.  If it was wrong for the US to support Kosovo, why is it now OK for Russia to support South Ossetia?  And at least in Kosovo, there was supposedly a continuation of the type of genocide that we had already intervened against in the Balkans.  But in Geogia, despite the likelihood of civilian casualties from the brief time before Russia invaded, there are no realistic claims of Georgian genocide.</p>

Moreover not all country hates America and Americans and we do not want war. I understand your indignation after all your opinion on a situation is formed by news and the TV. However having seen sites BBC and CNN, and also articles with descriptions of occurring events in a zone Georgian &#8211; the Osset conflict I have come to a conclusion that at the situation description many facts are considerably deformed by your correspondents and leaders of news, and many is rather considerable, practically on 180 degrees. Russia is shown practically as an aggressor attacked on poor and defenceless Georgia which only put things in order in the province, pacifying as is told on your site of &#8220;separatists&#8221;. While Russia has acted with the help to fraternal people to reflect attack of aggressors and to prevent occupation of Ossetia by the Georgian armies. That further would lead to civil war in region, and Georgia inspired with success certainly would continue the party of other unrecognized republic of Abkhazia in aggression. That does not speak that Russia is interested in the peace, and all forces are directed on that not to allow Georgia to grasp independent (let and not recognised) republic that in itself is a crime against humanity. The main news on site BBC at present is the information on an attack of the Russian air forces on Gori, also it is mentioned victims among the peace population of Georgia. However about more than 2000!!! The killed Ossetins why that the information is extremely poor. About that that Georgia the first has launched war having attacked at night a peace city also is ignored, are silent also fighters of special groups of Georgia which shower with pomegranates of women and children of buildings escaping in cellars from aggressors. Certainly the truth do not write and in Russian-speaking editions, there too muddle the information, демонизируют Saakashvilis and show a situation from foreshortenings favourable that the public opinion of citizens of Russia developed against Georgia and the USA supporting it. Simply understand that at each medal two parties and it is impossible to judge on a situation leaning against news presented English-speaking to mass media.</p>

<p>The United Nations, European Union, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Council of the European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and all other countries in the world recognize South Ossetia as part of Georgia. However, the de facto independent republic governed by the secessionist government held a second independence referendum[6] on November 12, 2006, after its first referendum in 1992 was not recognized by the international community as valid.[7] According to the Tskhinvali election authorities, the referendum turned out a majority for independence from Georgia where 99% of South Ossetian voters supported independence and the turnout for the vote was 95%[8] and the referendum was monitored by a team of 34 international observers from Germany, Austria, Poland, Sweden and other countries at 78 polling stations[9]. However, it was not recognized internationally by the UN, European Union, OSCE, NATO and the Russian Federation, given the lack of ethnic Georgian participation and the legality of such referendum without recognition from the central government in Tbilisi.[10]</p>

<p>Demographics</p>
<p>Before the Georgian-Ossetian conflict roughly two-thirds of the population of South Ossetia was Ossetian and 25-30% was Georgian. The present composition of the population is unknown, although according to some estimates there were 45,000 ethnic Ossetians and 17,500 ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia in 2007.[40] By August 2008 more than 70% of the South Ossetia citizens had Russian citizenship.</p>

<p>The US administration is NOT Conservative. They pretend to be so that they can get votes from people who are Conservative (maybe people like you and me).</p>
<p>Is it Conservative to spend as much money as the US government has spent?</p>
<p>Is it Conservative to nominate a family friend lawyer to the Supreme Court instead of one of the available Conservative judges?</p>
<p>Is it Conservative to build up a huge budget deficit and say it does not matter?</p>
<p>Is it Conservative to print money and bail out irresponsible investment banks in the current financial meltdown? (socialism for the rich).</p>
<p>Ron Paul is right you know.</p>
<p>By jumping to the conclusion that the US ally (Georgia) is the good guy you might find yourself supporting slaughter of innocents and ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline (sometimes abbreviated as BTC pipeline) is a crude oil pipeline that covers 1,768 kilometres (1,099 mi) from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field in the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. It connects Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan; Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia; and Ceyhan, a port on the south-eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, hence its name. It is the second longest oil pipeline in the world</p>
<p>The Caspian Sea lies above one of the world&#8217;s largest groups of oil and gas fields. As the Caspian Sea is landlocked, the transportation of oil to Western markets is complicated. During Soviet times, all transportation routes from the Caspian region were built through Russia.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union started a search for new routes. Russia first insisted that the new pipeline should pass through Russian territory, then declined to participate.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan_pipeline" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan_pipeline</a><br />

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnsBU_XWQJ8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnsBU_XWQJ8</a><br />
and you will understand the reasons for the Russian involvement in Georgia where oil an natural gas-lines run trough.. On every pipeline to the EU the russians and Poetin wants full control.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Not all media in the west, especially in the usa, in my opinion, convey objective information.</p>
<p>But Bbc.co.uk published: &#8220;7 August 2008 After escalating Georgian-Ossetian clashes, sides agree</p>
<p>to ceasefire; however Georgia launches a surprise attack&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you also read the Russian press to have information from both sides.</p>
<p>Here is the translated version:<br />
<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.akado.com%2Fnews%2Fdocument24972&#038;hl=ru" rel="nofollow">http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.akado.com%2Fnews%2Fdocument24972&#038;hl=ru</a></p>

<p>And also:<br />

<p>Russia, Ossetians and Georgia &#8211; the fraternal peoples. What about &#8211; which of leaders is</p>
<p>responsible for this crime, as well as my opinion &#8230; I will leave my opinion in order to give</p>
<p>you a chance to form your unbiased opinion including on the basis of articles at the Russian</p>
<p>sites too, which you can read using any online translator.</p>
<p>Once again, many Western and US Media hides the facts. Few journalists can not always publish</p>
<p>truthful unbiased information, even when so wish, and that we are seeing now, when this happens</p>
<p>masse.</p>
<p>P.S. This is strange, but in osetiya now there is not one foreign journalist, no one. They are</p>
<p>all in Georgia and transmit information on the basis that will hear from Georgian officials &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; Is this correct?</p>
<p>I very hope that my comment will be published.</p>

<p>One look at the map and one can clearly see that the argument of the BTC Pipeline is bullshit &#8211; no matter if SO is independent from Georgia or part of Russia gives Russia *any* more access to the pipeline then it has right now. To get access Russia would need to conquer technically all of Georgia &#8211; which will never happen. So stop eating the &#8216;it&#8217;s about oil&#8217; propaganda (well, you didn&#8217;t eat it on Saddam and Iraq? Yeah, you&#8217;re that stupid&#8230;).</p>
<p>So technically SO is souvereign but legally it is not (yet)&#8230; first Gulf War was about something similar, the evil guys invade a country and get their ass handed over &#8211; the difference? Iraq was no longer US ally while Georgia just happened to become one&#8230;</p>

This nonsene of it always being Georgian territory is just that; nonsense.  The only differentiation here is that the Ossetians decided to align themselves with Russia and the Georgians to America.  The blood of 2000 people lies at the feet of the American foreign policy.  By arming the Georgians and trying to woo them to their side.  The USA has created a monster.  Georgia is currently the 4th highest spender in military hardware compared to their GDP.  They in fact initiated this conflict not Russia.  You reap what you sow.  Instead of complaining about the destruction of their democracy, after attacking Ossetia, they should own up to their mistke.<br />
How is this any different to what America did in Kosovo?  In fact the USA armed moslem Kosovans against their neighbors the Serbs for years before the so called genocide started in Yugoslovia.  Why don&#8217;t we hear about this?  Serbians were too aligned with Russia for the taste of western powers.  They were very successful.  Today you have an ally in Kosovo and Serbia is coming around to their side.  The overall aim is to isolate and weaken Russia by incorporating as many of these eastern states into NATO as possible.  You can corner a bear only so far before it fights back to preserve itself.  Spare me your altruistic ideas of American policy.  Russia is an enemy because it refuses to open up its markets to foreign corporations.  Russia tried this in the early 90s and it was a disaster for Russia but a gold mine for western countries.<br />

Putin has shut down all unfriendly media (I&#8217;m sure Bush wishes he could do the same to the NYT) and has stolen billions of foreign assets.  At the same time, he arms Americas enemies in Tehran and Caracas without consequence, yet whines if America provides some training for the pathetically small Georgian Army.</p>

<p>You do? There are no simmilarities at all. Russia is a welcomed into S Ossetia, with majority of population being Orthodox Christians, while in Afganistan they walked into a 15th century backward country of fundamentalist muslims. Afganistan &#8211; a country of 13 mill in 1979 that is a size of Texas with terrain that is impossible to navigate for a non native, while S Ossetia is a country of 70k people that is a size of Rhode Island with beliefs and ideas very similar to southern Russia. This is more like first gulf war where Georgia = Iraq and USA = Russia, with Kuwait = S Ossetia. S Ossetia will become independent, with permanent Russian military base, or it will join Russia. Abhazia is soon to follow for its full independence.</p>
<p>Most Americans have no idea what people think and want in that part of the world, I can consider myself lucky have spent summer in Abhazia and Georgia in 1992&#8217;s summer. People DO NOT like each other.</p>

<p>The biggest day-to-day problem is getting information, she said, even simple information. When a reader asked her paper to find out where and when adults can play basketball in St. Petersburg, city officials told her to submit the question in writing and expect an answer in 30 days. Police now funnel all information through a press office that doesn&#8217;t have the facts, and takes two weeks to respond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day and every moment it is more and more difficult to get the information,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>And then there is the killing and intimidation of journalists. Twenty-one journalists have been killed in Russia since 2000, according to the World Association of Newspapers.</p>
<p>Last month a television crew that planned to cover a political demonstration was kidnapped from its hotel room, stripped naked and beaten. A journalist who was critical of Putin was turned away at the border when she tried to return home to Russia from a visit to Israel in December.</p>
<p>Moskovskiye Novosti (Moscow News) shut down this week. Novosti was the most influential newspaper in Russia as the Soviet Union was falling apart. People stood in line for hours to get a copy, amazed to see the truth on paper for the very first time. Its demise seems symbolic.</p>
<p>A few of my students in Russia did believe in the possibility of a free press, though not all who did were sure that a free press is a good thing. When one student asked if I thought Russia should have a free press, I turned the question back on her.</p>

<p>George Soros &#038; The Georgian Conflict</p>

<p>GEORGE SOROS &#038; THE GEORGIAN CONFLICT<br />
By Brother Nathanael Kapner, Copyright © 2008<br />
THE GEORGIAN “ROSE REVOLUTION” was funded by the Hungarian born Jewish financier, George Soros. The Rose Revolution forced President Eduard Shevardnadze out of office on November 23 2003 (St George’s Day in Georgia).</p>
<p>Soros installed Shevardnadze’s young protege, Mikhail Saakashvili, as the new and current President of Georgia. During the three months before the coup, Saakashvili, who was schooled &#038; groomed in America, was glorying in lavish treatment from the Zionist led US State Department and the Jewish controlled media. And in the previous summer Soros had flown Saakashvili and his followers to a “revolution training seminar” in Belgrade Serbia.</p>
<p>Back in Georgia from his training by Soros in Belgrade, Saakashvili led thousands of demonstrators brandishing fresh red roses in their takeover of the President’s palace. This occurred in the freezing Georgian winter when fresh roses had to be flown in — courtesy of the Jew, George Soros, who had spent $42 million on his new Georgian puppet. No sooner had Saakashvili taken office that he vowed to bring the Russian supported South Ossetia &#038; Abkhazia breakaway provinces back under Georgian control.</p>
<p>Soros and the US State Department, indeed, had publicly committed themselves to propping up the current anti-Russian Georgian President, Mikhail Saakashvili, considered by many to be an authoritarian thug. A confrontation between Russia and the US was now in the works. And it has come to a head with the recent conflagration in South Ossetia.</p>
<p>A BOILING HOT GEORGIAN COLD WAR</p>
<p>AMERICA’S PRO GEORGIAN POLICY is explained by Georgia’s access to the Caspian Sea’s oil wealth. The US backed British Petroleum (BP) pipeline, running from the Caspian Sea through Georgia, then below the Black Sea into Turkey, delivers oil to Europe and the US. The US &#038; its European allies have been competing with Russia for control of the Caspian oil rich region.</p>
<p>The pipeline runs only 60 miles south of the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, which sits right smack in the middle of northern Georgia. South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s and exists as an independent state with full Russian support. Most South Ossetian residents hold Russian passports.</p>
<p>The US considers Georgia as an ally and supports its desire to join NATO and the EU. Moscow opposes both goals. Georgia’s pro Western stance has riled Russia because Moscow regards the entire region as its own sphere of influence.</p>
<p>In April 2002, the US started the “Georgia Train and Equip Program” which involved US training of Georgian forces. Soon after, Georgian militaries were sent to Iraq to form part of the US/UK occupation forces there. With regard to the current South Ossetia conflict, the US has been supplying Georgia with both equipment and military advisers. And Russia is now accusing the US of orchestrating the war.</p>
<p>Moreover, the US partner in Zionist international hegemony, the State of Israel, assisted Georgia in its August 8 2008 attack on the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, with a bevy of its own military advisers. This brought the conflict to a military climax.</p>
<p>Thus, Georgia will continue to be a cold war hotspot with Russia and the US competing to control the Caspian oil bonanza. And the Jew, George Soros, and his puppet, Mikhail Saakashvili, have brought this new cold war centered in Georgia to a boiling head.</p>

Have you ever heard about the USSR? Georgia was the part of it.Or we should have said: &#8220;Hey,guys,leave your homes and lets go to Russia!Oh,you dont want to..well,its a pity..&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey coward Russians, why not bring your Strategic Bombers loaded with nuclear weapons to Cuba, and arm them with nuclear weapons once again? Didn&#8217;t you hear your Putin lost the chicken race and trashed such plan? LOL!!!!!!! Come on, if you Vodka drunken Ruskies and your gov have any guts, bring your nuclear weapons to Cuba!</p>

<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ve amended your take on Russia&#8217;s &#8220;standard operating procedure&#8221;. The Ossetians are not ethnic Russians. Neither are the Abkhaz. Neither, for that matter, is even a sliver of Georgia&#8217;s population.</p>
<p>But please do beat the drum of war with a rationale that&#8217;s a complete falsehood: we Americans, after all, seem to do that kind of thing quite often.</p>
<p>All of you moral retards also seem to fail to grasp the point made by Nathan Hodge (who work for YEARS covering the defense industry &#8212; good luck being a peacenik in the defense industry trade mags) in this article. The Bush Administration didn&#8217;t give guns and training (as recently as 30 days ago!) to Georgia to &#8220;protect&#8221; them from Russia. They gave them to the Georgians to protect them from a non-existent threat from al-Qaida. You were lied to *again* and you don&#8217;t give a good goddamn &#8212; you just keep swallowing a shit sandwich and telling us that it tastes great, that you&#8217;re a better man for swallowing it, and bless the chefs for fooling you into taking a bite by telling you it&#8217;s roast beef.</p>

Their own commanders commended Georgia for &#8220;finally doing something&#8221; about the al-Qaeda linked extremists in the Pankisi Gorge. BTW, everyone wants to tout history, realizing of course that Russia&#8217;s invasion of Finland (a democracy) in 1937 was provoked by the Finns and Hitlers invasion of Poland (a democracy) was &#8220;provoked by the Poles and their treatment of ethnic Germans&#8221; come on. The reality is, Putin and his ilk believe the West is too weak to stand up to Russia, NOT militarily as we&#8217;d wipe them out and he knows it, but politically we have a bunch of Neville Chamberlain appeasment buffs who do not have the stomach to stand up to a real bully that might fight back and they know that too. Instead choosing to take on middle east despots with little outside support. This seems to put the lie to the statement that we are trying to spread and support democracy. ONly when it won&#8217;t cost anything and only if the opponent is weak. Whether what Georgia did or did not do is right is NOT the issue, it would be more like Mexico support Texas separation because 90% of the population is mexican from illegal immigration. NO COUNTRY, NOT EVEN RUSSIA has recognized South Ossetia and none will, so Russia will do what it alwasy wanted to do and assimilate South Ossetia into itself. Case closed. Putin is right, the WEst IS weak.</p>

Why he could be responding to actions by the Bush Administration. If Tblisi had successfully cleaned up the Ossetian mess by December, Georgia might be well on its way to NATO membership This would weaken Russia&#8217;s hand in dealing with Iran at the UN or on the international stage altogether. The Russians are good chess players, and they can read moves far in advance. They had the intelligence and foresight to stop the NeoCon plans in their tracks in Ossetia by backing the independence seeking people of South Ossetia and fucking up Georgians in their &#8220;Iraqi&#8221; style blowjob of an invasion.</p>

<p>Obviously you and other nitwits here don&#8217;t know the history of the region. Both Abkhazians and Ossets hate Georgians just like you hate Russians.<br />
And Saakashvily reminded Ossets one more time why they hate Georgians by carpet bombing their capital to the ground. They don&#8217;t want to be part of Georgia. What is it don&#8217;t you understand about that. Whether Putin is a dictator or  not, whether Russian army is an aggresor or not   is irrelevant. Georgians have been abusing their minorities (Abkhaz, Osset, Ajar and others) during the whole Soviet period. For example they intentionally settled hundreds of thousands ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia so that Abkhazians become minority in their own country. Yes Russians are taking advantage of the situation, but in truth Georgians have not been angels either.</p>

Korean peninsula damn near to China until they got involved and helped the North push back to the current DMZ.  So, by this reasoning I could say the N. Koreans got slaughtered in S. Korea.  We did well considering we had nothing but ocean at our back and North Korea had China and Russia at theirs.<br />
Separation of Church and State has been in our Constitution since it&#8217;s founding.  That&#8217;s nothing new.<br />
You bad mouthed our ideals and in doing so stated your own so, it sounds to me like you&#8217;re upset that your ideals are dominated by ours.

<p>Now that US supports statelets like Kosova it is sheer hypocracy to oppose Ossetia becoming independent.</p>

This forum should be a vehicle for understanding and enlightenment of how to protect out world from aggressors. History is important to see where we came from &#8211; not where we are going; especially if lessons have been gained. Sovereignty starts in the hearts and minds of those who desire it. People like Gandhi and Mandela shine as examples. My friends and I are making parcels of food and clothing to send to both peoples from S.O. &#038; Georgia, we are not rich people, however we can share what we have. We have found a way to act, I challenge other posters to find a positive way to help this conflict end.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is not history.  It&#8217;s a free encyclopedia made by people who wish to voice their point of view about the way it happened.  Spare me the propaganda.  I don&#8217;t believe that the problem today was caused by one action.  Don&#8217;t forget the Persian Empire (present day Iran) had to be fought.  They had their ways of ruthlessly dominating everything around them which later caused the Greco-Persian War.  What goes around comes around and I&#8217;m sure one day someone else will come into power and those who wish to be in power will wine and cry about everything they will be doing.<br />
So, lets not blame it all on us.  That area has been dominated by Turks, Muslims, Arab Muslims, Brits, Greeks and others.  That area was unstable long before we showed up.</p>

<p>Who in this world practices what they preach?  It&#8217;s just more noticeable if we don&#8217;t because all the World&#8217;s eyes are on us as a superpower.  We also allow more freedom to the media and allow them to report these things and don&#8217;t allow the State to run them. For instance, this blog was initiated by a person within our Country and implicates us in causing the Georgian-Russian fighting if you read to far into it&#8217;s title.</p>

It&#8217;s stupid to arguing like you&#8217;re have some posts in government. Calling russians &#8216;bears&#8217; and &#8216;trolls&#8217;, americans &#8216;idiots&#8217;.

You better think about how to stop the war. Vote against the military solution of the problems!<br />
America doesn&#8217;t have to be a guarant of democracy! It&#8217;s a myth made by mass media to justify all aggression acts undertaken for money, oil and gas.<br />
And now Russia and America fighting for only one reason. To proof which one can be called the world leader.</p>

There are no nations. There are no peoples. There are no Russians. There are no Arabs. There are no Third Worlds. There is no West. There is only one holistic system of systems. One vast and immane, interwoven, interacting, multi-varied, multi-national dominion of dollars. Petro-dollars, electro-dollars, multi-dollars, reichmarks, yen, rubles, pounds and shekels.</p>
<p>It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this planet. That is the natural order of things today. That is the atomic, and sub-atomic and galactic structure of things today.</p>
<p>What do you think the Russians talk about in their Councils of State? Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, mini-max solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like we do. We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies Mr Beale.</p>
<p>Russia is waging war against Georgia because they think in the long they will be financially better off than if they let Georgia invade South Ossetia.</p>

<p>Are Russian hands clean?  No.  Is Georgia a democracy?  No.  Georgia&#8217;s &#8220;Rose Revolution&#8221; was bought by Rothschild money, so-called &#8220;non-governmental organizations,&#8221; and the US-Israeli governments.  Any and all light mortar &#8220;provocations&#8221; from ill-equipped Ossetian militia upon Georgian positions do not justify Georgia&#8217;s heavy weapon, night-time artillery barrage and air attacks upon the small town of Tskhinvali, which resulted in the deaths of 1,400 civilians.  Georgia, backed by the U.S. and Israel, initiated the &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; response in this affair. I hope to see the U.S.-Israeli stooge SucKaWilly brought before a Russian &#8220;Nuremberg&#8221;-style court and dispensed with, accordingly.</p>

Oh my god! Wake up!<br />
There&#8217;s no pressure to resist! US is just trying to weaken the position of Russia in the world (hopefully, they are not mad enough to get into war with Russia). Maybe you don&#8217;t know the history, but Ossetia was never a part of Georgia, Stalin, who was Georgian, joint Ossetia to Georgia. And after the Soviet Union stopped to exist, ossetians wanted their freedom back. Now Georgian government acts with the support of US, they never wanted peace and refused signing a peace act. And finally they attacked Ossetia and now they firing and bombing its territory and Russian peaceful forces in Ossetia and saying they don&#8217;t do anything. That&#8217;s ridiculous and I cannot believe Americans are gonna buy it and still think they are right. IS USA A DEMOCRACY IF YOU BELIEVE ANY SHIT THE GOVERMENT POPS UP?</p>

The CIA&#8217;s support has been substantiated by many different witnesses, writers and people who were in Kosovo at the time.<br />
The CIA&#8217;s role in Iran for example is well documented by the Top Secret files confiscated by the Iranians from the US Embassy in the Hostage crisis.  The overthrow of Iran&#8217;s leadership (Mosaddeq) is well documented.  It&#8217;s the same rule book that&#8217;s been used for the last 50 years.  Find friendly politicans, fund them through NGOs&#8217; and arm them indirectly via friendly governments.  Take for example America&#8217;s role in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  The US openly admits to arming Afghanistan via Pakistan for years.  Unfortunately for the US leadership at the time, they didn&#8217;t have the foresight to see what these terrorists could do with the training and weapons they were giving them; 9/11/01.<br />
Limiting the discussion to just publicized events makes no sense and sticking your head in the sand doesn&#8217;t either.<br />

You can argue who started what and who&#8217;s grandfather kicked who&#8217;s cow way back when. FACTS: Georgia did NOT invade South Ossetia, it is a linguistic impossibility as know one, not even Russia recognizes Abhkazia or S. Ossetia as separate from Georgia, but rather within the national borders of Georgia. The Georgians can no more &#8220;invade&#8221; S. Ossetia than the US could &#8220;invade&#8221; New York. Thus, though perhaps a technicality, if you believe the Russian press, Georgia conducted an &#8220;offensive&#8221; within their own national internationally recognized borders. Russia INVADED Georgia the moment they stepped into either one of those provinces. Regardless of reason, by definition it is an invasion. &#8220;An unrequested incursion beyond the national borders of another state&#8221;.

<p>Im not advocating child abuse,idiot</p>
<p>Im advocating minding your own business. Shortly before i posted my previous comment, Busch, Mccain, Rice and even Obama had chimed in and &#8220;DEMANDED&#8221; That Russia cease hostilities in the region. Now who the fuck are we , as a sovereign  nation, to tell another sovereign  nation what to do. we dont have the right to suggest, much less demand action of any sort. If somebody wanted to send a note that said&#8221;uhh..Ivan, i think this is a bad idea, maybe you should rethink your plan here.&#8221; But to demand a ceasefire in the world press and threaten russia with &#8220;consequences&#8221;. Thats just arrogance. we are not the world police. the fact of the matter is we have no business over there. We need to keep our collective noses out of it.</p>

Don&#8217;t argue with fools that have been divided so easily by their own misleading government. These guys wouldn&#8217;t know foreign policy if it shit on their face and served them McDonalds. That&#8217;s why they continually see two different parties in the American presidential race when there really is only one driving force with two slight variations of foreign policy opinions, thats called divide and conquer i.e&#8230;Kissinger and his neoconservatives lunatics that back McCain, and Brzezinski and his gang of thugs that are using Obama.</p>
<p>Peter &#038; Gerry,,you&#8217;re absolutely right, this is about NATO expansion; who cares about the details or who is funding it. It&#8217;s not who, it&#8217;s what&#8230;</p>
<p>BTW, great post RockTime. It&#8217;s too bad Americans will wake up when their country is in ruins and owed by foreign nationals/corporations,,,oh wait, that&#8217;s already happening because you&#8217;re dollar is being plunged by so-called &#8216;Patriots&#8217;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m more worried about the ramifications of that oil pipeline on the possibilities of war. US and Russia cannot go to war with each other. The cold war showed us that this is as far as war can go. The age of might is ending and now it is time for the global, informational age we&#8217;ve all been promised.

<p>There is some great humor to that post,,here in Israel we now know that the Jewish people have been used and hoodwinked, much like the vast majority of Americans..Israel isn&#8217;t as powerful or influential as the world thinks, we&#8217;re just a pawn for internationalists with a bigger idea in store. Yes, it is hard to swallow, but I&#8217;m afraid it is true. It&#8217;s too bad for America as well, as they were undoubtedly the greatest experiment in world history. Your government, starting with Bush Senior has slowly but surely violated &#038; eroded the Constitution under the guise of &#8216;Patriotism.&#8217; It will be very apparent real soon.</p>

However and I quote… no, not from the Bible but from a known green midget source saying “Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering” I pray the latter will not come to be, for the the day will surely come when Russia has burned its own bridges across the world and when allies are running short.</p>

My only question is&#8230;if I&#8217;m sitting in a Russian made tank and I see another through my scope, knowing that both sides use them, do I shoot? Talk about some major red on red possibilities. The only major systems sold to Georgia by the evil US were less than 20 Vietnam era Huey helicopters. And as to gas issues, that is the major weakness of the Russian economy, even the Saudis acknowledge that oil is in decline and are looking for ways to diversify their economy. Oil as we say in the business world it is in its &#8220;cash cow&#8221; stage, it&#8217;s no longer a growth industry. Sure there is lots of money to be made in the short term, and there is no doubt that it is fueling an economic boom in Russia, but what about the long term. And to be quite frank, if I were Russian I&#8217;d be more concerned with China and it&#8217;s insatiable need for more resources as it eyes Siberia than I would a dinky little country like Georgia.</p>

<p>As a side note I find it somewhat amusing that when the US trains with Georgia it&#8217;s encouraging war, but when the US trains with Russia, which it does (did) all the time, it&#8217;s encouraging peace and cooperation.

<p>The US blundered into the Iraq war on the basis of dumb PR, wrong intelligence and total cluelessness about historic ethnic animosity, with every tribe taking turns at leading us around by the nose.  Here we go again in Georgia, tied in by Iraq of all places.</p>
<p>Ossetians will fight to the death to avoid being governed by Georgians &#8211; that&#8217;s been their culture for hundreds of years and it kept them independent until Stalin gave Ossetia to Georgia.  Stalin was a Georgian born in Gori, so he tossed plenty of perks, like the odd smaller country or two, Georgia&#8217;s way.  Hometown boy makes good and all that.</p>
<p>When Stalin&#8217;s Soviet Union fell apart in 1990 the Ossetians fought Georgia for two bitter years to regain their independence from Stalin&#8217;s gift of them to Georgia.  They won and in 1992 Georgia agreed to their autonomy and promised not to try to take South Ossetia by force.  Russia sent in peacekeepers (no other country wanted to get involved, a wise call in retrospect) and for sixteen years the South Ossetians have been free of Georgian rule.  No one else would recognize them, but at least they were free.</p>
<p>Good times only last so long.  Georgia needed money so they sucked up to the US by sending 2000 troops as cannon fodder for Iraq.  With an embattled Bush Administration trying to color the Iraq war as a &#8220;multinational&#8221; effort, those 2000 guys were plenty enough to get the Bushies on their knees in gratitude.  Next thing you know, megabucks and military aid flowed Georgia&#8217;s way, with thousands of US advisors rotating in and out of the country and arms and weapons aplenty for George Bush&#8217;s new best friends.</p>
<p>Oh, and despite Georgia&#8217;s loving maintenance in Gori of a huge statue of Josef Stalin, one of the worst Communist dictators and mass murderers in history, the Bushies started testifying again and again how wonderfully democratic the Georgians had become.  2000 body bags ready to go in Iraq will do that for you.</p>
<p>So what happened?  Turns out Georgia&#8217;s East Coast college educated President Saakashvilli knows how to work PR magic with the Bushies but he doesn&#8217;t know how to run a country.  Never did it before, seems like.  Georgians looking for jobs and a good life were getting tired of endemic corruption, broken promises, sinking economy&#8230; well, you know, kind of like the Bush Administration.  So what&#8217;s a close friend of George Bush going to do to raise his popularity? What would George do? Hey! There&#8217;s the answer! Invade a smaller country!</p>
<p>Losing to the Ossetians in 1992 took a bite out of Georgian pride, so Saakashvilli promised his party and his people he&#8217;d restore that pride by taking South Ossetia back.  Problem was, after sixteen years of running their own show the Ossetians had gotten kind of used to being independent. Worse yet, after becoming pariahs as far as Georgia was concerned they had turned to their other neighbor, Russia, for food, fuel, passports, foreign aid and all that other good stuff.  Russia was happy to oblige, made promises to Ossetia, lots of Russians settled there (cheaper than Moscow, you know, and a lot better weather), well, the usual drill when big countries pick up a new client.  All that first date stuff.</p>
<p>Saakashvilli also made the mistake of trying to buff up his image inside Georgia and with the Bushies by poking Russia in the eye at every opportunity.  Worked well in Georgia but you really have to ask yourself if that was smart given the total lack of any sense of humor in the Russian leadership about getting poked in the eye.  Even the Bushies finally realized they had a loose cannon on their hands.  Too late, comrades, too late!</p>
<p>Last Thursday night as the Ossetians and all the rest of the world was sitting down to watch the Olympics on TV, Saakashvilli launched a really well executed, sneak attack tank and air assault on South Ossetia.  Caught them totally by surprise and took the capital of South Ossetia almost before the Ossetians could put down their vodka and get up from the TV.  Didn&#8217;t know the Georgians had that in them!  But you know how those sneak attacks work great when they catch some bozo by surprise.  Worked great at Pearl Harbor, too.</p>
<p>Turns out Georgia had detailed intelligence gathered by flying drones over South Ossetia for months prior.  Just two months ago three drones were shot down, so you know they had a lot more than just three.  Russia and Ossetians should have been tipped off by that, but it looks like they never imagined Georgia would come storming across the border with tanks, killing anyone that got in their way.  Dumb Russians!</p>
<p>It gets worse.  Those stupid Russians had a bunch of peacekeepers in South Ossetia who never got the memo about when the enemy comes in with tanks and all you&#8217;ve got is side arms you get the heck out of Dodge. Time to cut and run just like the West did in Rwanda.  It&#8217;s not your fight, man, so just run back to the TV, keep watching the Olympics and let the Georgians do what they came to do.</p>
<p>Stupid Russians didn&#8217;t get that memo.  The Russian peacekeepers lined up against the Georgian tanks, pulled out their pistols and got cut to pieces, about a hundred of &#8216;em killed outright.  Stupid Russians.  Don&#8217;t they know being a peacekeeper is about running away from a fight?   Maybe they were just mad about having to miss TV coverage of the Olympic opening ceremony and were too liquored up to realize the Georgians were shooting to kill.</p>
<p>Well, you know how unreasonable the Russians get when you kill a few hundred of their people.  You hear people say thousands got killed, but despite the odor of corpses in the streets of South Ossetia it&#8217;s hard to add up more than a few hundred, counting the handful of peacekeepers and a bunch of Ossetian and Russian civilians.  Those Russians should drink less vodka and get a better sense of proportion when they complain about genocide.</p>
<p>But, heck no, that&#8217;s not the Russian way.  They just have no sense of proportion at all, acting real mad when you run them over with tanks.  Hey, don&#8217;t they know that Georgia is a democracy and the Georgian president went to Columbia and is a good friend of Bush?  Don&#8217;t they know that Georgia wouldn&#8217;t have pulled a sneak attack and killed all those people unless they were provoked real bad by those horrible Ossetians?  Nope.  All that impeccable Bush logic was a lost cause with the Russians.</p>
<p>Well so those totally insensitive Russians started driving tanks across the border from Russia into Ossetia as fast as they could.  Lucky for the Ossetians the Russians had plenty of tanks because the border to Ossetia is only about five miles from the Russian war zone with Chechnya and Ingushetia.  The Russians have been fighting a war there for about twenty years against Islamic crazies so they had plenty of tanks on hand.</p>
<p>In case anyone forgets, the Chechens are those wonderful people who think an effective military strategy is to seize 500 people in a hospital as hostages, killing as many of them as they can to get the Russians riled up.  Works great!  The Chechens also introduced the innovation of chainsawing the limbs off hostages on video to show they mean business.  That sure gets your attention as well.  So, anyway, given the Chechens are about the only group on the planet who scare the innards out of Russians that meant Russia had plenty of tanks and Chechen war battle-hardened troops available just a few miles away that could rush into South Ossetia.  And so they did.</p>
<p>Saakashvilli planned on taking South Ossetia overnight and he almost made it.  Darned peacekeepers wouldn&#8217;t run, though, and that slowed him up just enough for the routes into Russia to stay open and allow the aforementioned Chechen war battle-hardened troops to come streaming into Ossetia.  There weren&#8217;t many of them (too few roads) but man, were they honkin&#8217; mad at how the Georgians had interrupted their much-anticipated viewing of Olympic beach volleyball.  Don&#8217;t get much nookie in those Chechen war zones you know, so they weren&#8217;t happy about being deprived their bikini athletic experience.</p>
<p>There was also that small matter of how Russians go postal when you kill a few hundred of their people in a sneak attack, and the usual indignation when the Russian military gets caught by surprise and made to look like fools.  Yep, those Chechen war battle-hardened troops were in a mean mood.</p>
<p>In fact they blew the Georgians out of South Ossetia in about 24 hours even though the Georgians outnumbered the inital Russian troops about ten to one.  Heavy casualties on all sides, not that the Russians cared.  No surprise the Russians kept coming and blasted their way into Georgia itself, streaming more and more armor across the border until, surprise! Russia held about a ten to one advantage over Georgia.  With characteristic Russian understatement, a tank commander was heard to comment to a journalist, &#8220;Anyone who attacks Russia we will destroy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you might expect the Bushies were totally surprised their unhinged client pulled a stunt like invading South Ossetia.  What to do?  Job one is to make it clear It Was Not George Bush&#8217;s Fault.  Blame the Russians, which the Russians eagerly helped the Bushies do by making sure they sent spokespeople who couldn&#8217;t speak a word of English and when they did acted like their own worst enemies.  Good job, Russians!  Bush rolled out the script that a peaceful, democratic ally got attacked by a revived Soviet bear and now we have got to&#8230; what?</p>
<p>Well, you know the Bush doctrine.  First part, build a missile system in an unrelated country like Poland.  Second part, make sure no Mexican immigrants can get a job.  Well, OK, no Mexicans there but we do have Ossetians.  Let&#8217;s put the screws on them as the fall guys.  They made the Georgians invade them.  There, that makes sense!  Final part, let&#8217;s get the US military involved so we can start another war.  Perfect!</p>
<p>And, just like with Iraq an imbecile media is going to follow the above script when the Bushies feed it to them at the briefings.  You know those reporters: deep down inside they all are uncertain about the length of their equipment so as soon as any president starts a shooting war they all like it when manpower and weaponry go on display.   After a while (like a lot of bad dates) the hangover sets in and the media starts to regret what they agreed to the night before.  Not too many media guys will admit to how happy they were for Bush when he dragged us into Iraq, will they?</p>
<p>We now have the spectacle of American arms and American prestige committed to defending Stalin&#8217;s partition of a tiny country, Ossetia.   It&#8217;s a screwball world when it is the Russians that are trying to overturn Stalin&#8217;s diktat and to restore independence to that small country.  Way to go George Bush!  You put us on the side of Stalin!  That&#8217;s a real cool historical legacy every American should want.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more! We now have the Bush administration committing American arms and prestige to defending a, get this, sneak attack timed to take advantage of the opening of the Olympics.  Hey, that&#8217;s wonderful.  That&#8217;ll show the world our commitment to peace and freedom.  Makes the Russians look bad, too, the way our client (go Georgia!) caught them napping.</p>
<p>So, backing a sneak attack and supporting Stalin&#8217;s world view is the American way, and getting Americans involved in yet another war where we are being played for fools by unstable clients will be the parting gift of the Bush administration.  Is that what everyone wants?</p>
<p>Then again the Russians are being &#8220;disproporionate,&#8221; as if they didn&#8217;t get the memo about rolling over and playing dead.  Dumb Russians.  No sophistication at all.  And, they got less medals than us.  If that wasn&#8217;t a good reason to build more missile systems in unrelated countries and start more wars we can fly drones and get killed in, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p>I can hear some readers muttering, &#8220;OK, wise guy, what would you have us do?&#8221;  Hey, that&#8217;s easy.</p>
<p>First off, we can&#8217;t blame the Georgians for anything because that would make us look bad.  Repeat after me: the Georgians were provoked.  The Russians made them defend themselves.  We told them to resist being baited but gosh darn it, those Russians went too far.  They did something terrible.  Not sure what it was yet but we&#8217;ll come up with something in a couple of days.</p>
<p>Second, it wasn&#8217;t a sneak attack.  No.  You got that completely wrong and as soon as I get done PhotoShopping this you&#8217;ll see it was the Russians that attacked first.  They invaded a smaller country.  The Georgians were relaxing in their tanks, peacefully resting after cleaning up the South Ossetian neighborhood from some unsightly, formerly-living bodies,  drinking whatever it is that Georgians drink when the Russians attacked them.</p>
<p>Third, the Russians have a totally disproportionate response going.  Get out of Georgia, out of Ossetia and go back to Siberia or someplace.  We&#8217;ll bury their dead and the Georgian dead as well.  No, wait, there won&#8217;t be any Russian dead after I get done PhotoShopping this.  Oh, and all those Georgian and Ossetian guys rampaging and holding up SUVs in the war zone, that&#8217;s a job for the Georgian police.  They&#8217;ll do a much cleaner job of holding up those SUVs, just like they did before the war. Oh and this time we&#8217;ll make sure to assign proper UN peacekeepers who know how to cut and run when civilians get killed. We can use the French!</p>
<p>Fourth, let&#8217;s get Georgia into NATO.  It&#8217;s a great idea to involve unstable countries in NATO so in case John McCain gets elected he&#8217;ll have lots of reasons to go to war.  Republicans like that, you know, so you have to plan for the future.</p>
<p>Fifth, let&#8217;s build a missile system in Poland.  This is completely, totally necessary to defend the Germans and the French against Iranian missiles and spending trillions of dollars on that is a great way to make sure the French never run out of reasons to ridicule the falling dollar.  It also gives the Russians something to aim their nukes at besides us.</p>
<p>Finally, let&#8217;s ask Russia to throw the G7 out of the G8 and to pull out of the WTO. It is too embarrassing that we&#8217;re the only country that needs the WTO anymore since our economy depends upon manufacturing in China.  This will fix that by removing any need for the WTO.  And, once Russia throws the G7 out of the G8, since they are the only country that is energy-independent in the G8 we&#8217;ll be spared the humiliation of having the G7 fall apart when the aforementioned Germans and French and all the rest get down on their knees to Russia&#8217;s control of the energy they need.</p>
<p>Oh, and let&#8217;s make sure to impose Stalin&#8217;s plan for Ossetia.  Last thing we want is to guarantee free elections to let the Ossetians choose if they want to be free of war, to be their own country or to join whatever country they want.</p>
<p>Spike, over and out!</p>

I&#8217;ve read every blog on this site and, though I shouldn&#8217;t be, I&#8217;m astounded by the ignorance that surfaces in times of crisis. For the anti-semites who post their misguided ideas here, I can only laugh at your stupidity and your ignorance. I&#8217;d be more angered by you, but the fact that your claims have no basis in fact and that you latch onto and spin anything in the media to further your misguided agenda leaves me in a position more to pity you than hate you. Look at who the media panders to and from whom they get funding, look at the moguls who own what the U.S. views, look at the religious Right in the United States and tell me they&#8217;re all Jewish. Ignorance. Глупости! I caution every person reading, listening, and viewing coverage of this catastrophe in Southern Ossetia: learn the facts of what has transpired. Challenge youreself to see beyond what your news allows you to see.  Read and listen to sources outside of your geographic sphere.  Humanity demands you be educated. Think for yourself, and stand up to injustice. The criminals depend on your indifferece and ignorance. Show them you won&#8217;t stand for it. Tell everyone you know that the truth must be uncovered and that you will not rest until you learn the facts. We are not pawns to be manipualted with misinformation in a game played by politicians and their economic backers. A real person has been killed. A real person is searching for his son or daughter in the rubble. A mother and father whose hopes and dreams came alive with the birth of their child are paralyzed with fear as they search for him in the destruction. Parents: look at your child now as he or she is sleeping soundly. All you need to do is imagine yourself in Ossetia now. What would you do to protect your most precious gift? It is time to stand up to the people of the world who play war safe in their capitals while real living breathing dreaming people die at their whim. I am a husband, a father, a son, a brother. I work and tire and dream and love and I am frustrated. I am a human being capable of empathy and action just like you. I want an end to war and aggression NOW.</p>

If someone was to mess with our troops in a place we are there to protect we would hand down gloves off kick their teeth in.</p>
<p>Russia is only defending itself from a attack on its allies(south Ossetia).    I don’t see anything wrong with that.   It does not matter that the people there have only been there since 1920.   Apparently it has not been to important to Georgia to remedy.</p>
<p>We are going in and putting our troops in harms way by sending them on a humanitarian mission in a still unstable zone.<br />
This is asinine and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>The cease fire was requested by Georgia because they knew they were getting their rumps handed to them.<br />
America did the same thing Russia is doing now.   When idiots kept fighting us in Afghanistan and Iraq. WE KILLED THEM!!!   That is what happens when you bite off more than you can chew.</p>
<p>It is not our responsibility to fix the stupid mistakes of another country.<br />
If Georgia wants to start wars they need to make sure they can execute.<br />
Basic SunTzu<br />
You don’t attack unless you are sure you are going to win.</p>
<p>America is not under any obligation to protect these stupid leaders.<br />
This is defiantly not our responsibility.<br />
We have other things to worry about not this childish leader that made the absolute wrong decision by messing with a bigger country.</p>
<p>And then to top it off we have this sycophant Condoleezza Rice who does not understand what is going on over there taking a hard line demanding action.   Everything I have read about this woman is that she is a manipulative politician with no spine.  Defiantly not willing to stand up for what is right more of a yes (wo)man with an education.  We do not belong in this conflict at all!</p>
<p>The administration has the nack for sending the wrong people in to handle situations.  From Bremer and Rumsfeild in Iraq to Michael D Brown during hurricane Katrina.  I would not trust sending this ignorant lady to represent the united states and for her to get us into a dire position because of her obsequious ignorance.</p>

Let’s face it if someone was breaking into your home to steel your property and kill your family what would you do? Would you stand there and let them do it?</p>
<p>I am completely disgusted with the news reporter from MSNBC this evening 9/23-2008 that was basically was attacking the president of Georgia asking him why he would attack the Russian troops invading his own country. This is a no-brainer! It is no different from reporters that have accused Israel of attacking Palestine. Despite what the news reporters tell us here in the United States, Israel was attacked FIRST and they only attacked back as people were propelling serious ammunition out of Lebanon onto their fishing villages in Haifa in 2006. Those people that live there in that area of Haifa are not militants! Of course the news reporters here in the US do not disclose that and rather just showed Israel attacking back. What was NOT communicated to the public through the news here in 2006 was that Israel had to bring their military to that region of Haifa as it is a very rural area. I have been to that exact spot in 2004 and it is a very scarcely populated area. When that fighting began, it was for one reason and one reason only. Hezbollah/Syria and Palestine want to take over Israel to gain complete control of land/oil in the Middle East and they began strategically attacking that fishing town to gain control of a region of Israel quickly for further attacks. This is about money and power. You do not hear of Israeli’s car bombing and suicide-bombing Palestinians on public buses or in major villages in Palestine; this is because they only attack back out of protection as they know if they do not fight they will loose their home. The news teams here in the US never give us all the information! Poor Palestine they say…..are you really going to say poor Russia? They are a massive militant machine attacking a tiny nation that you can driver across in less than a day.</p>
<p>The President of Georgia is in a similar position as the surrounding nations also want to take over his land/country for the very same reason the same groups would like to take over Israel; money/power. Georgia, like Israel has a tremendous amount of natural resources and surrounding powers are corrupt and want to control that land.</p>
<p>This is the way of the world as money is power and those 2 little tiny nations have so many natural resources which =$$ in such a small area of land that the “powers” of the world want control over.</p>

If the US abandons these 2 tiny nations, do you really think that Russia and the Arab Nations will give us an oil discount?</p>
<p>News Flash! There are about 5,000 palaces in just the one country of Saudi Arabia the size of Disneyland! Do you think the people in these palaces will give the US a “discount” on oil should they retain complete control? If the US does not intervene and help these nations we could potentially be paying 40$ a gallon for gas! Can anyone afford that? The US helps these nations to keep the oil prices from skyrocketing! Do you think people that strap bombs on their own children will not raise prices of oil to the very nation they despise? If Russia and the Arab Nations obtain complete control the US will not be able to afford oil. This is why these groups have bonded together and Russia is helping the Arab Nations attack Israel. If they can obtain these 2 small countries they will inevitably control the world’s oil supply.</p>

I am Australian and spent one month in Southern Russia with a good English speaking Russian about 4 years ago. One thing I know for certain now is we in the West have been fed a lot of crap. Our Media is sick. Russian Media in many ways is twice as honest.<br />
On Georgia &#8211; read up your history or read the English translation of Putins interview with CNN on the Subject. Ossetia etc. has the right to be separate or a part of Russia if they want to if you look at History and the Ethnic make up of the people and the choices they made in the past. We are not talking ancient history here &#8211; recent history &#8211; if you say they should be part of Georgia then in effect you are saying you agree with Stalin. You are a Stalinist as Putin says in his interview.<br />
The normal Western problem &#8211; we always open our mouth without knowing what we are talking about. You just got rid of a President like that. For God sake learn.<br />
Russia does not need Georgia to get oil out and there is no oil in Georgia as far as I know anyway. Russia has built a Pipeline to Europe already under the Caspian Sea or Balck Sea [I forget my Geography also and I have been there]. It has other ports etc. If anybody has an interest there it is Western Countries and there Oil Companies who do not have access to the last great Oil reserves on Earth. Afghanistan also would be handy there. Russia never needed Afghanistan as our Western Conspiracy idiots tried to tell us. USA types.<br />
I personally think they just wanted to help a Moderate Socialist Government in control of the North at the time get on top of the Talliban [the now Talliban craeted in the main by the CIA - that was really brilliant to pull that off]  and claen up an area that has needed cleaning up for a long time. Afghanistan would be handy for the West to get access to Oil in the CIS Republics though &#8211; so would a Georgia on side. Why would Russia want Georgia &#8211; it is resource Poor &#8211; differnt Ethnically and Culturally while they have the greatest Resource Wealth in the World per head of Population along with Australia.<br />
Why would they want a liability. What they do not want is an unstable Neighbour that could drag them into a War with NATO. Of course Russians will fight for waht is right. They proved that in WW2 winning about 75% of the War in Europe &#8211; yes agreed to by all Historians etc. and they did the first part with blood and guts under a bad ex Georgian Leader &#8211; Stallin.<br />
I am right on Russias side on this one &#8211; not everything though in the past but neither are many Russians &#8211; at least they can admit mistakes in the past. When will the USA do that &#8211; admit they made a mess in Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia etc. Admit they got most of that wrong and the best thing that has ever happened is for Europeans to be out of Asia. A bit late now but I wonder waht the Middle East would be like if Europeans had minded there own business there 100+ years ago. Bette rfor sure.</p>

It looks like censorship is now finally finished in the USA and we will hopefully see some of the Hawks of the past finally pushed out of places of power. Exactly what Russia has been about for about 20 years [Apart from Stalin I think they have always been OK - we just pushed them into a corner and as someone said - Russians bow down to no one] and especially the last 8-9 years.</p>
<p>You still have some absolute morons who will never change but at least don&#8217;t let them ever get power again. We in Australia must be a bit ahead of you &#8211; there has been a marked change here in the last 5 years. Good to see it happening now in the USA. For the last few years more and more Aussies have been starting to se the USA as the real enemy. That will change now in no time if O &#8216;bama continues the way he has started. Some of the comments by your Moron class about Russia in this debate just shows how much misinformation they have been fed by your so called FREE PRESS.<br />
I have read all the Posts now and it is good to see Freedom of speach returning to the USA. You are going to have to do something with your Education System though in the long run and make many in the USA more aware of the rest of the World. To start with it is time to destroy the American Myth &#8211; the Greatest Democracy in the World &#8211; really??. You certainly do not need any more exports from Australia like Murdoch in your Media either. He knows better but obviously $&#8217;s are all he cares about &#8211; not truth. Everything being equal he now should soon start siding up to O&#8217;bama just in case he wants to take over some other Media Group. That is how it works I think.<br />
Good on the thinking people in the US for finally taking control again.<br />
I am gratefull to see Russia get back on its feet. We do need a Balancing Power in the world and they are the best we have. They are big enough to make others think twice and I admire there fierce independence [they don't have to belong to a Bikie Club to feel like a Man] and with there present leadership they do not worry me at all.<br />
They will if they can keep a stable Government be a real force again soon along with China &#8211; already are in many ways. No problems there now either with there current leadership. Moderate and balanced and most of all they mind there own business.<br />
How Bush ever managed to put together such a mob of Idiots I can not understand.<br />
We all were conned &#8211; we were also in Australia for awhile.</p>
