School: By Jen Shroder <br>
At Excelsior Middle School in Byron County, a handout called &quot;Islam: A
Simulation&quot; was used to help children &quot;become Muslim.&quot; This
handout can be seen at<br>
<a href="http://www.blessed-cause.org/Indoctrination/ByronCountyShocker.htm"><span
style='color:navy'>http://www.blessed-cause.org/Indoctrination/ByronCountyShocker.htm</span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>The handout states: <br>
&quot;From the beginning, you and your classmates will become Muslims.&quot;
Children choose Muslim names, &quot;play Jihad,&quot; memorize the Quran, pray
to Allah and fast for Ramadan. Islam is transformed to a fanciful fun religion
and an unrealistic view of Islam is planted in their minds, even as Christians
and Jews are killed at every border of predominantly Muslim nations. <br

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

these class activities are acceptable, opening doors for all schools to
incorporate such practices. This is not a choice for parents. Bill Clinton's
&quot;Religious Expression in Public School&quot; state: <br>
&quot;Students generally do not have a Federal right to be excused from lessons
that may be inconsistent with their religious beliefs or practices.&quot; <br

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>Pay attention. There went religious freedom. A
brave few parents have been objecting to the Christian persecution and Muslim
indoctrination happening in public school today. Darla Dowell bravely objected
to the censorship of Christmas in public school while Hannukah and Islam's
Crescent Moon are allowed. She stood alone. Valerie Moore objected to a large
banner in front of her school proclaiming, &quot;There is one God, Allah, and
Muhammad is his prophet.&quot; Valerie, too, stood alone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Elizabeth Lemmings objected to children
pretending they are Muslims, taking Muslim names, wearing Muslim clothes,
memorizing the Quran and playing Jihad. A teacher and alone, the social
pressure was intense to the point that Jonas and Tiffany Eklund actually picked
up the baton and filed the lawsuit against Byron Union School District on
behalf of their children. Last week the case was dismissed. It takes courage to
stand up for what is right, to fight for religious freedom. How disappointing
that a federal judge completely disregarded the double standard and dismissed
the case, leaving children mandated to memorize the Quran, learn Muslim beliefs
as fact and embrace Islam while Christmas is outlawed. <br style='mso-special-character:

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>Our children's Social Studies textbooks teach
that Rome fell 1) because of Christians (somehow unexplained...) 2) because of
the lethargy of the people. History is repeating itself. Instead of getting
involved, we went shopping. We cared more about the content of the latest
burger at BurgerKing than we did the content of our children's textbooks. We
turn off Bill O'Reilly because reality is too outrageous and we'd rather be
entertained at the movies. We applaud Bilbo and Aragorn in &quot;Lord of the
Rings,&quot; we cheer as they forge ahead against impossible odds overwhelmed
by the enemy, we live and breathe their victories, but we bury our heads<br>
at what is happening in our own world. Mel Gibson played a courageous godly man
in &quot;The Patriot.&quot; At first he refused to get involved with the
Revolution, remembering the cruelty of war in the past. But after his son lay
murdered in his arms, after evil and oppression overtook his world, he attacked
the soldiers who intended to unjustly hang his second son. We cheered as he
fought a bloody battle and freed his family. Afterwards, in moments of
reflection, his sister-in-law said, &quot;You've done nothing for which you
should be ashamed.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

many of us have done nothing. Our children have been sustaining attacks on
faith alone in public school and floundering. We are losing our families, our
heritage, our freedom. Islam is resolved, either by persuasion or force, to
overtake America. Clear evidence that Clinton surrendered our children to Islam
behind closed doors can be found at <a

from Muslim indoctrination, it is behind the scenes and I pray it is so...but
with every day that passes, with every unanswered judgment by a treasonous
court, hope for revival led by a godly president fades. So as we close our eyes
to the state of our country and buy tickets to see Bilbo and Aragorn fight for
the freedom of Middle Earth, as we cheer for the<br>
courage of the Patriot, as we think we identify with heroism, know that we left
the real heroes out in the cold. The Darla Dowells, the Valerie Moores, the
Jonas and Tiffany Eklunds, who sacrificed their worlds, subjected their
children to taunts and persecution, braved public opinion and stood against
public school tyranny. But they stood alone, and today, with the stroke of a
federal judge, they lost the war they battled to protect OUR children. <br

something is really wrong at this TARGET store. We were not asking for
thousands of dollars, not even hundreds, just a small sponsorship for a
memorial remembrance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>As a follow-up, I
e-mailed the TARGET U.S. corporate headquarters and their response was the
same. That's their national policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½
</span>Then I looked into the company further. They will not allow the Marines
to collect for 'Toys for Tots' at any of their stores. And during the recent
Iraq deployment, they would not allow families of employees who were called up
for active duty to continue their insurance coverage while they were on
military service. Then as I dig further, TARGET is a(SURPRISE) French-owned
corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Now, I'm thinking again.
If TARGET can not support American Veterans, (&quot;bk I couldn't agree more)
then why should I and my family support their stores by spending our hard

Without the American Vets, where would France be today? <br>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>The division of the human family into its two
distinct branches, liberals and conservatives, occurred some 20,000 years ago.
Until then all humans coexisted as members of small bands of nomadic
hunter/gatherers. A thousand generations ago, in the pivotal event of societal
evolution, beer was invented. This epochal innovation was both the foundation
of modern civilization and the occasion of the great bifurcation of humanity
into its two distinct subgroups. Once beer was discovered, our prehistoric
forefathers decided it was time to settle down. Making beer required grain, and
securing a steady supply of it ordained the invention of agriculture. After
that was accomplished, ancient man quickly, and unfairly, consigned actual
cultivation to women. Men couldn't just run off, willy-nilly, however. Neither
the glass bottle nor the aluminum can had yet been invented, so it was
necessary to stick pretty close to home, and the brewery.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>This left our male ancestors with a lot of
time on their hands, and led to the division of the species, which persists to
this day. Some men tried to conserve remnants of the old way of life (hence the
term &quot;conservative&quot;) by spending their days in the open field in the
dangerous pursuit of big game animals. At night they would roast their prey at
a big barbecue, and afterwards sat around the fire drinking beer, passing wind
and telling stories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Other, more timid,
souls stayed closer to home. They are responsible<br>
for the domestication of cats and the invention of group therapy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Mostly, they sat around worrying about how
life wasn't fair and concocting elaborate schemes to &quot;liberate&quot;
themselves from inequity (thus their designation as &quot;liberals&quot;). In
the evening they gathered around their fire, nibbling on fruit and nuts,
sharing their innermost feelings. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

hostage and we let them lead us around by the noses for 444 days. We even made
it a point to let the world know how angry we were at this kind of treatment,
however we did NOTHING! In an opinion held by many and most assuredly shared by
me. We should have done is gone to the Iranians at 8 a.m. the next morning and
told them to release our people by noon or Iran would become the world's most
famous parking lot by 1 p.m. We allowed this to pass. Our people were gotten
out alive, but at what price? We allowed them get away with what they did,
since then the Arab world has been a thorn in our side, seeing this as a sign
of weakness. Attacking us all over the world at will! The Arab world has seen
that as a sign of weakness ever since. Look at how many thousands of innocent
people have been killed since then. Our people are paying the price now. So we
didn't find WMDs in Iraq? So what! The time long since passed for us to draw a
line in the sand in the Arab world. We drew that line in Afghanistan and again
in Iraq - and it was in &quot;THEIR SAND&quot;, not ours. This enemy are

PatriotPetitions.US, the nation's leading public opinion advocate for
Constitutional integrity, has embarked on a new campaign entreating the
President and Congress to support meaningful tax reform legislation, including
H.J. Resolution 15 to &quot;Repeal the 16th Amendment and Abolish the Income
Tax,&quot; in accordance with Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution,

States Government from engaging in business in competition with its
citizens.&quot; Given the limited influence of constitutional constructionists

reform is essential to America's economic future, and fundamental to our
nation's historic commitment to personal liberty and equality.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>I recall getting strange looks, several years
ago, from people whom I told it was time to buy their guns and ammunition at
gun shows - for cash - off paper - no records.&nbsp; Now, of course, it is all
but impossible to buy a gun of any sort without getting into the Federal and
state databases, thanks to the background checks.&nbsp; Unless you're a
criminal on the street, of course - business as usual there.&nbsp; It's just
America's law-abiding gun buyers of whom they're keeping track.&nbsp; It will
make it real easy to collect them when the time comes. I still get strange
looks.&nbsp; Today, however, it is because my advice in regard to guns has
shifted to:&nbsp; &quot;It's time to bury your guns and ammunition.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes, they actually are confiscating certain types of weapons in certain parts
of the country - especially California, of course - and Washington, DC, too -
anyplace where there is skyrocketing crime is where they are taking the guns
away from honest civilians.&nbsp; Leaving guns only in the hands of street
gangs and other assorted thugs - such as the local police forces. But, it isn't
the escalating confiscation that causes me to say bury them now.&nbsp; Time
enough for that when we see them going door to door in the big cities, after
all.&nbsp; Rather, it is because the authorities are starting to use innocent
gun ownership as a basis for labeling those of us who speak out as
&quot;domestic terrorists,&quot; to be thrown in jail. Yes, I know exactly how
that sounds. No, I am not being excessively paranoid.&nbsp; Yes, they now are
investigating perfectly ordinary people.&nbsp; People just like you.&nbsp; Yes,
they now are arresting law-abiding people who merely speak out against the
current American regime.&nbsp; People just like me.&nbsp; Guess what class of
people is due to be arrested next?&nbsp; Consider me your
canary-in-the-coal-shaft.&nbsp; When you stop hearing from me, you know that
you will be the next one to be picked up.&nbsp; Of course, by then there will
be nobody left to speak out on your behalf. Here's a link to a story written by
a fellow, who just happens to be a journalist, who recently was investigated
and interrogated by two FBI agents in Atlanta because somebody reported that he
was reading a story entitled &quot;Weapons of Mass Stupidity,&quot; while
standing in a coffee shop line:&nbsp; http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/2003-07-17/rant.html
.&nbsp; Here's a link to the article that got this guy in trouble, merely
because he was reading it in a public place:&nbsp;
http://charlotte.creativeloafing.com/newsstand/2003-06-04/news_cover.html
.&nbsp; Interrogated.&nbsp; By the FBI.&nbsp; For reading.&nbsp; In
Public.&nbsp; Think about that for a moment.&nbsp; Okay, now you're ready to
move on to the next outrage. Meet Artie Wheeler.&nbsp; Artie is in jail
today.&nbsp; Arrested by the Baltimore Police and labeled a domestic terrorist.&nbsp;
Because he owned guns and gunpowder.&nbsp; All his guns and all his reloading
supplies and equipment, including the gunpowder, are perfectly legal under
existing city, state and federal laws.&nbsp; He's being held on a charge of
&quot;reckless endangerment.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speculation is that the charge against
Artie arises from the gunpowder, both black and smokeless, being kept in
plastic jugs.&nbsp; Problem is, gunpowder routinely is resold to the public in
plastic jugs.&nbsp; It's the best and safest way to handle it.&nbsp; Black
powder is used for old-time guns, like flintlocks, and smokeless powder is used
for modern bullets, which Artie reloaded himself in order to save money. I can
hardly wait for them to come out here to Idaho and start arresting people for
this sort of thing.&nbsp; Almost everybody has guns and many reload their own
ammunition in order to save money.&nbsp; And there are lots of black powder
aficionados who shoot privately and in competition.&nbsp; America's South is
full of them, busily reenacting the War of Northern Aggression (you may think
of it as the Civil War) on weekends. Artie wasn't home when the Baltimore SWAT
team broke down the door and then handcuffed his 72-year-old wife to the
bedstead for seven hours, while they ransacked the couple's home.&nbsp;
Elizabeth is a proud grandmother, in fact, great-grandmother to three
youngsters.&nbsp; They took the couple's computer equipment, private papers and
$8,000 in cash which the couple kept in their home for safety...for
safety.&nbsp; Now, with her husband in jail and out of work, Elizabeth has no
money with which to buy groceries, let alone hire an attorney.&nbsp; But the
police have the couple's $8,000 savings, don't forget.&nbsp; (Before I
forget:&nbsp; Elizabeth Wheeler, 512 South East Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland
21224-3913.&nbsp; Be generous, if you've a mind to.) Remember, in this day of
the Patriot Act and Homeland Defense, the police no longer require probable
cause.&nbsp; They need merely use the magic phrase, &quot;domestic
terrorist,&quot; and all remaining constitutional protections disappear. Artie
is being held on a misdemeanor charge, under $2,000,000 bail.&nbsp; Yes, $2
million.&nbsp; You heard me right.&nbsp; For contrast, another name in today's
news, star basketball player Kobe Bryant, is out of jail on his rape, assault
and battery charge (of a 19-year-old white girl), having posted just $15,000
bail.&nbsp; And he's rich.&nbsp;&nbsp; Artie Wheeler is broke since they took
the couple's $8,000 savings, yet he is in jail under $2 million bail.&nbsp; Of
course, Artie is white.&nbsp; No, you are the one being naive if you don't
think that skin color and fame make a difference. So, you say, why Artie?&nbsp;
What makes him such a target?&nbsp; Well, he and his 72-year-old wife have been
passing out National Alliance literature.&nbsp; The National Alliance has been
targeted by the ADL, one of the truly evil terrorist organizations in the world
today, as being &quot;hateful&quot; because it objects to the favoritism given
to other races at the expense of whites.&nbsp; Here is the National Alliance's
web site:&nbsp; http://www.natvan.com/ .&nbsp; You can read an in-depth
interview of great-grandmother Elizabeth there. Why didn't they arrest
Elizabeth, too?&nbsp; Because the trumped-up charge is based on the perfectly
legal guns and gunpowder owned by her husband.&nbsp; Also, the spectacle of
locking up this great grandmother was probably too much for even these
modern-day Gestapo jackbooted thugs in Baltimore. Another National Alliance
member, Chester Doles, was arrested a couple of months ago.&nbsp; His
collection of twelve pistols and rifles, all legal, figured prominently in his
being labeled a domestic terrorist.&nbsp; In Idaho, that would be a merely
average collection, believe me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to ski pretty earnestly and
still own about twenty pair of skis.&nbsp; At any one time, if you are serious,
you really need at least 8 pair of skis, each with a completely different set
of characteristics:&nbsp; slalom, giant slalom, ice, bumps, rocks, powder and
slush.&nbsp; Guns are kind of like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you really
are a domestic terrorist, bent upon killing people from a distance, then you
really need only a single weapon.&nbsp; Ironically, it's those with a great many
guns who prove that they are the true sportsmen.&nbsp; It's kind of like not
needing to worry about the country with lots of nuclear missiles; rather, the
real concern is the fellow with a single nuke. So, boys and girls, that is why
I say it is time to bury those guns.&nbsp; Before they use them as a pretext
for arresting you because you were seen reading something critical of the
President.&nbsp; But, hold back one or two.&nbsp; You'll need to give them
something when they come to your door, collecting the guns, as they inevitably
will, or they will be suspicious.&nbsp; Bury the ones you bought off paper (no
registration or background checks).&nbsp; Or, someday you may need a couple of
holdouts in order to fight your way to your main arsenal. Either way, it's
time. Here's hoping you have a nice day!!<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

The bottom line is this: Things are not as bad as they appear on the news. I
can't believe how bad the press is, even Fox news which I don't think is that
much better than the Communist News Network (CNN). Why do they only report on
the one or two soldiers killed daily? They don't report on the millions of
great things we do on a daily basis to make this country better. These people love
us for the most part. It is only a very small amount of unorganized Ba'ath
left-behinds who are giving us trouble. We have turned Al Hillah into one of
the richest, safest cities in Iraq. The only people who probably know this are
the Marines and the people of Al Hillah. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

the same damn town. These journalists come in for a day or two, never get out
of their SUVs, walk around, go into people's homes, or play with kids at
schools. They hear that a soldier was killed by a sniper. Power went out.
People took to the streets to protest a weapons turn in policy, a pay cut, or a
new mayor. Then all of a sudden this place is &quot;unstable&quot; and &quot;a
quagmire.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>How many American

reconstruction in the south, even post-Nazi Germany? How have these so-called

Many in the State Department may have opposed Ronald Reagan's fervent<br>
anti-Communism in the 80's. But it was much worse back in the '30s, '40s<br>
and '50s. <br>
CBN.com - WASHINGTON, D.C. - The State Department is supposed to<br>
represent America's best interests to the rest of the world, but critics<br>
say it often fails to do that. In fact, they say it sometimes acts in<br>
opposition to American interests. <br>
Within days of America's flash war to topple Saddam Hussein, Newt<br>
Gingrich was warning the State Department was busy pursuing policies<br>
that would throw away the fruits of that military victory. His main<br>
charge: in a violent world of terrorism and growing anti-Americanism,<br>
the State Department is still sleepwalking in its normal way, passive<br>
and accommodating to America's enemies, operating out of a liberal<br>
worldview. <br>
Critics say the State Department has a long history of doing this, and<br>
in the process, sometimes subverting the President it is supposed to<br>
serve. The Reagan years are a good example. <br>
&quot;Sometimes it's worthwhile destabilizing some country, like when Ronald<br>
Reagan destabilized the Soviet Union and brought it down,&quot; said Herb<br>
Romerstein. <br>
Romerstein worked on Capitol Hill in those days, and Michael Horowitz<br>
served in the White House. They were ideological opponents of the State<br>
Department bureaucrats. <br>
Romerstein said, &quot;You don't know how shocked they were when Ronald<br>
Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as an 'evil empire.'&quot; <br>
Horowitz said, &quot;I thought that half the people in the State Department<br>
would go into cardiac arrest that week. They were certain and terrified<br>
that this was going to start World War III.&quot; <br>
&quot;The State Department bureaucracy did generally not approve of the<br>
President's anti-communism. They were more of an accommodationist bent,&quot;<br>
said Faith Whittlesey who served on Reagan's staff and watched Foggy<br>
Bottom try to undermine his initiatives. <br>
&quot;They felt very strongly that those policies were wrong-headed,&quot;<br>
Whittlesey said. &quot;Their reactions varied from, I would say, inaction to<br>
the point of out-right subversion.&quot; <br>
Why is it like this with the State Department? There are a couple of<br>
reasons. Certainly, one of them is philosophy. <br>
Whittlesey said, &quot;They could be described, I would say, 90 percent<br>
liberal.&quot; <br>
&quot;They came out of an academic community that told them America is the<br>
problem in the world, and that's what they hear at their cocktail<br>
parties,&quot; said Romerstein. <br>
Whittlesey said, &quot;[Their views] could be described as conforming pretty<br>
closely to the editorial page of the Washington Post.&quot; <br>
&quot;Any conservative administration cuts against the grain of where many of<br>
these career people stand,&quot; said Horowitz. <br>
Many in the State Department may have opposed Ronald Reagan's fervent<br>
anti-Communism in the 80's. But it was much worse back in the '30s, '40s<br>
and '50s. In those days the Soviet Union was directing Communist agents<br>
who actually worked in the State Department and other high places in the<br>
U.S. government. <br>
&quot;They were heavily infiltrated by Communists and most of the Communists<br>
in the State Department were Soviet agents,&quot; said Romerstein. &quot;They<br>
would network and you could see them rising to high places.&quot; <br>
He continued, &quot;You had Harry Hopkins, the closest friend of Franklin<br>
Delano Roosevelt, who was a Soviet agent.&quot; <br>
These positions and this networking let them manipulate America's<br>
foreign policy. &quot;They could keep things from the President,&quot;
Romerstein<br>
said. <br>
In China, some of these agents helped fellow communist Mao Tse Tung's<br>
cause. Romerstein said, &quot;[They would] feed back to Washington similar<br>
reports so that their comrades back at the State Department could say,<br>
'Look, we're not only getting it from our own people, we're getting it<br>
from the Treasury Department representative, from the OSS<br>
representative.'&quot; <br>
Whittlesey said, &quot;Which led eventually to the ascendancy of Mao Tse-Tung<br>
and the deaths of millions and millions of people.&quot; <br>
But Harry Truman in the late '40s planned to draw the line against the<br>
Communists in Greece and Turkey, boldly announcing America would do<br>
whatever it had to stop Soviet expansionism. How did the State<br>
Department react to his tough stance? <br>
&quot;Here were the Communists about to take over Greece and Turkey,&quot;<br>
Horowitz said. &quot;For the most part, the State Department reaction was one<br>
of absolute horror.&quot; <br>
Romerstein is an expert on Communist infiltration of the U.S.<br>
government. He says Truman realized from secret investigations these<br>
agents were on the inside working against him. <br>
&quot;But he was frightened the Republicans would use this as a political<br>
weapon against him and against the New Deal, and so he did what he could<br>
to cover up many of these Soviet spies,&quot; said Romerstein. <br>
Congressmen like Senator Joe McCarthy eventually hounded most of these<br>
agents out of government. McCarthy is vilified by America's media today<br>
as a Red-baiter, but Romerstein said, &quot;He was right in most of the<br>
cases, because he had the files, State Department files, on their own<br>
infiltrators.&quot; <br>
The Communists may have been ousted, but that did not take the lean to<br>
the left out of the State Department. In 1982, Whittlesey became U.S.<br>
ambassador to Switzerland, but she was still speaking out forcefully for<br>
Reagan's policies, like the Star Wars defense shield, and opposing the<br>
spread of communism in Central America. She says Foggy Bottom applied<br>
pressure to her staff not to support her views. <br>
Whittlesey said, &quot;There were people from the State Department<br>
bureaucracy who came over to Berne to essentially warn the career<br>
officers who were on my staff.&quot; <br>
When John Kennedy was told Soviets had sneaked missiles into nearby<br>
Cuba, the State Department refused to believe it, and even claimed it<br>
was impossible. <br>
Romerstein said their belief was that &quot;the Soviet Union would never do<br>
anything like that. They wouldn't offend us like that by sending<br>
missiles 90 miles from our shores.&quot; <br>
Romerstein says this bias led the bureaucrats to miss important<br>
evolutions among America's enemies. They insisted the Soviets would only<br>
support Communist terrorists, so they were blindsided by the KGB's<br>
backing of Middle East terrorists and hijackers, its push to train<br>
Iranian radicals who overthrew the Shah of Iran. <br>
But these critics say this misguided thinking is not all a result of<br>
leftist bias. It is also that the State Department is too easily seduced<br>
by conventional wisdom and lazy thinking. They live in a sort of<br>
bureaucratic bubble with the other diplomats of the world. <br>
Horowitz explained, &quot;Stability is the goal; change is the threat.&quot; <br>
So it creates an inertia when crises hit, like Hutus slaughtering Tutsis<br>
in Rwanda, Congo spiraling into bloody civil war, Iran and North Korea<br>
racing to arm themselves with The Bomb. The State Department's answer?<br>
&quot;Negotiate with the guys, sign a piece of paper, give 'em money, declare<br>
victory,&quot; said Horowitz. <br>
Whittlesey describes an iron triangle made up of State Department<br>
bureaucrats and their allies in the press and among the congressional<br>
staffs. &quot;And they form a kind of permanent government in this town,&quot;
she<br>
said. &quot;They make it clear that if young officers do not adhere to a<br>
certain policy agenda in everything they do, their careers will go<br>
nowhere.&quot; <br>
CBN News asked the State Department to react to this story. They would<br>
not give us an interview, saying our charges are: &quot;Nothing more than<br>
politics as usual. There are always multiple viewpoints, multiple<br>
opinions and multiple theories.&quot; <br>
Even if most of the State Department disagrees with Bush, foreign policy<br>
analyst Michael Ledeen insists that is not necessarily a big problem. <br>
Ledeen said, &quot;The worst thing that could happen to a President is to<br>
have unanimity of advice. And I think if Powell and Rumsfeld and Tenet<br>
and Rice came to him and always said the same thing, I think that'd be<br>
terrible. I think any President should want to hear a wide-open debate.<br>
Bush has said many times he wants to.&quot; <br>
And Whittlesey, Romerstein and Horowitz are not completely negative<br>
about the department. &quot;There are some wonderful people I've met at the<br>
State Department,&quot; Horowitz said. <br>
&quot;Patriotic Americans who were selflessly devoted to doing their
duty,&quot;<br>
said Whittlesey. <br>
But Horowitz points out that many do not like anyone from outside the<br>
diplomatic corps meddling in what they consider their business. Take the<br>
Sudan issue, for example. <br>
&quot;It's produced 25 percent of the refugees on this earth, more than two<br>
million people killed,&quot; said Horowitz. &quot;I've heard State Department<br>
officials complain bitterly about Bush defining the priority that Sudan<br>
gets. And then of course they say, 'Well, it's all those Christians who<br>
are forcing him.'&quot; <br>
It turns out, some in the State Department often look down their noses<br>
at believing Christians. Horowitz explained that many in the department<br>
share a view that's something like this: &quot;'My God, they watch CBN News<br>
to get their news! They're not our people. They're threats.'&quot; <br>
And Horowitz said, to many of these bureaucrats, Bush is the epitome of<br>
these people. At a Washington dinner before the war, a senior State<br>
Department official stated to Horowitz: &quot;'There are crazy people in this<br>
administration, crazy military officers who are going to get us into a<br>
crazy war.'&quot; And Horowitz recalled, &quot;I said, 'Do you think George
Bush<br>
is crazy?' At which point his response was, 'YES!'&quot; <br>
Romerstein said, &quot;They'd prefer a President who worried about world<br>
public opinion, which means the opinion of the leftists. And they don't<br>
like Bush and they're hoping President Hillary could change the<br>
situation for them.&quot; ï¿½k&quot; God forbid&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

&quot;Neo-conned&quot;<br>
<br>
The modern-day, limited-government movement has been co-opted. The<br>
conservatives have failed in their effort to shrink the size of<br>
government. There has not been, nor will there soon be, a<br>
conservative revolution in Washington. Political party control of the<br>
federal government has changed, but the inexorable growth in the size<br>
and scope of government has continued unabated. The liberal arguments<br>
for limited government in personal affairs and foreign military<br>
adventurism were never seriously considered as part of this revolution.<br>
Since the change of the political party in charge has not made a<br>
difference, who's really in charge? If the particular party in power<br>
makes little difference, whose policy is it that permits expanded<br>
government programs, increased spending, huge deficits, nation building<br>
and the pervasive invasion of our privacy, with fewer Fourth Amendment<br>
protections than ever before?<br>
Someone is responsible, and it's important that those of us who love<br>
liberty, and resent big-brother government, identify the philosophic<br>
supporters who have the most to say about the direction our country is<br>
going. If they're wrong-and I believe they are-we need to show<br>
it, alert the American people, and offer a more positive approach to<br>
government. However, this depends on whether the American people<br>
desire to live in a free society and reject the dangerous notion that we<br>
need a strong central government to take care of us from the cradle to<br>
the grave. Do the American people really believe it's the government's<br>
responsibility to make us morally better and economically equal? Do<br>
we have a responsibility to police the world, while imposing our vision<br>
of good government on everyone else in the world with some form of<br>
utopian nation building? If not, and the enemies of liberty are<br>
exposed and rejected, then it behooves us to present an alternative<br>
philosophy that is morally superior and economically sound and provides<br>
a guide to world affairs to enhance peace and commerce.<br>
One thing is certain: conservatives who worked and voted for less<br>
government in the Reagan years and welcomed the takeover of the U.S.<br>
Congress and the presidency in the 1990s and early 2000s were deceived.<br>
Soon they will realize that the goal of limited government has been<br>
dashed and that their views no longer matter.<br>
The so-called conservative revolution of the past two decades has given<br>
us massive growth in government size, spending and regulations.<br>
Deficits are exploding and the national debt is now rising at greater<br>
than a half-trillion dollars per year. Taxes do not go down-even if we<br>
vote to lower them. They can't, as long as spending is increased,<br>
since all spending must be paid for one way or another. Both<br>
Presidents Reagan and the elder George Bush raised taxes directly.<br>
With this administration, so far, direct taxes have been<br>
reduced-and they certainly should have been-but it means little if<br>
spending increases and deficits rise.<br>
When taxes are not raised to accommodate higher spending, the bills must<br>
be paid by either borrowing or &quot;printing&quot; new money. This is one<br>
reason why we conveniently have a generous Federal Reserve chairman who<br>
is willing to accommodate the Congress. With borrowing and inflating,<br>
the &quot;tax&quot; is delayed and distributed in a way that makes it difficult<br>
for those paying the tax to identify it. For instance, future<br>
generations, or those on fixed incomes who suffer from rising prices,<br>
and those who lose jobs - they certainly feel the consequences of<br>
economic dislocations that this process causes. Government spending<br>
is always a &quot;tax&quot; burden on the American people and is never equally
or<br>
fairly distributed. The poor and low-middle income workers always<br>
suffer the most from the deceitful tax of inflation and borrowing.<br>
Many present-day conservatives, who generally argue for less government<br>
and supported the Reagan/Gingrich/Bush takeover of the federal<br>
government, are now justifiably disillusioned. Although not a monolithic<br>
group, they wanted to shrink the size of government. <br>
Early in our history, the advocates of limited, constitutional<br>
government recognized two important principles: the rule of law was<br>
crucial, and a constitutional government must derive &quot;just powers from<br>
the consent of the governed.&quot; It was understood that an explicit<br>
transfer of power to government could only occur with power rightfully<br>
and naturally endowed to each individual as a God-given right.<br>
Therefore, the powers that could be transferred would be limited to<br>
the purpose of protecting liberty. Unfortunately, in the last 100<br>
years, the defense of liberty has been fragmented and shared by various<br>
groups, with some protecting civil liberties, others economic freedom,<br>
and a small diverse group arguing for a foreign policy of<br>
nonintervention. <br>
The philosophy of freedom has had a tough go of it, and it was hoped<br>
that the renewed interest in limited government of the past two decades<br>
would revive an interest in reconstituting the freedom philosophy into<br>
something more consistent. Those who worked for the goal of limited<br>
government power believed the rhetoric of politicians who promised<br>
smaller government. Sometimes it was just plain sloppy thinking on<br>
their part, but at other times, they fell victim to a deliberate<br>
distortion of a concise limited-government philosophy by politicians who<br>
misled many into believing that we would see a rollback on government<br>
intrusiveness. <br>
Yes, there was always a remnant who longed for truly limited government<br>
and maintained a belief in the rule of law, combined with a deep<br>
conviction that free people and a government bound by a Constitution<br>
were the most advantageous form of government. They recognized it as<br>
the only practical way for prosperity to be spread to the maximum number<br>
of people while promoting peace and security. <br>
That remnant-imperfect as it may have been-was heard from in the<br>
elections of 1980 and 1994 and then achieved major victories in 2000 and<br>
2002 when professed limited-government proponents took over the<br>
administration, the Senate and the House. However, the true believers<br>
in limited government are now shunned and laughed at. At the very<br>
least, they are ignored-except when they are used by the new leaders<br>
of the right, the new conservatives now in charge of the U.S.<br>
government. <br>
The remnant's instincts were correct, and the politicians placated them<br>
with talk of free markets, limited government, and a humble,<br>
non-nation-building foreign policy. However, little concern for civil<br>
liberties was expressed in this recent quest for less government.<br>
Yet, for an ultimate victory of achieving freedom, this must change.<br>
Interest in personal privacy and choices has generally remained<br>
outside the concern of many conservatives-especially with the great<br>
harm done by their support of the drug war. Even though some<br>
confusion has emerged over our foreign policy since the breakdown of the<br>
Soviet empire, it's been a net benefit in getting some conservatives<br>
back on track with a less militaristic, interventionist foreign policy.<br>
Unfortunately, after 9-ll, the cause of liberty suffered a setback.<br>
As a result, millions of Americans voted for the less-than-perfect<br>
conservative revolution because they believed in the promises of the<br>
politicians.<br>
Now there's mounting evidence to indicate exactly what happened to the<br>
revolution. Government is bigger than ever, and future commitments are<br>
overwhelming. Millions will soon become disenchanted with the new<br>
status quo delivered to the American people by the advocates of limited<br>
government and will find it to be just more of the old status quo.<br>
Victories for limited government have turned out to be hollow indeed. <br>
Since the national debt is increasing at a rate greater than a<br>
half-trillion dollars per year, the debt limit was recently increased by<br>
an astounding $984 billion dollars. Total U.S. government obligations<br>
are $43 trillion, while total net worth of U.S. households is just over<br>
$440 trillion. The country is broke, but no one in Washington seems<br>
to notice or care. The philosophic and political commitment for both<br>
guns and butter-and especially for expanding the American<br>
empire-must be challenged. This is crucial for our survival.<br>
In spite of the floundering economy, the Congress and the administration<br>
continue to take on new commitments in foreign aid, education, farming,<br>
medicine, multiple efforts at nation building, and preemptive wars<br>
around the world. Already we're entrenched in Iraq and Afghanistan,<br>
with plans to soon add new trophies to our conquest. War talk abounds<br>
as to when Syria, Iran and North Korea will be attacked.<br>
How did all this transpire? Why did the government do it? Why<br>
haven't the people objected? How long will it go on before something<br>
is done? Does anyone care?<br>
Will the euphoria of grand military victories-against<br>
non-enemies-ever be mellowed? Someday, we as a legislative body must<br>
face the reality of the dire situation in which we have allowed<br>
ourselves to become enmeshed. Hopefully, it will be soon!<br>
We got here because ideas do have consequences. Bad ideas have bad<br>
consequences, and even the best of intentions have unintended<br>
consequences. We need to know exactly what the philosophic ideas were<br>
that drove us to this point; then, hopefully, reject them and decide on<br>
another set of intellectual parameters.<br>
There is abundant evidence exposing those who drive our foreign policy<br>
justifying preemptive war. Those who scheme are proud of the<br>
achievements in usurping control over foreign policy. These are the<br>
neoconservatives of recent fame. Granted, they are talented and achieved<br>
a political victory that all policymakers must admire. But can<br>
freedom and the Republic survive this takeover? That question should<br>
concern us.<br>
Neoconservatives are obviously in positions of influence and are<br>
well-placed throughout our government and the media. An apathetic<br>
Congress put up little resistance and abdicated its responsibilities<br>
over foreign affairs. The electorate was easily influenced to join in<br>
the patriotic fervor supporting the military adventurism advocated by<br>
the neoconservatives.<br>
The numbers of those who still hope for truly limited government<br>
diminished and had their concerns ignored these past 22 months, during<br>
the aftermath of 9-11. Members of Congress were easily influenced to<br>
publicly support any domestic policy or foreign military adventure that<br>
was supposed to help reduce the threat of a terrorist attack.<br>
Believers in limited government were harder to find. Political<br>
money, as usual, played a role in pressing Congress into supporting<br>
almost any proposal suggested by the neocons. This process-where<br>
campaign dollars and lobbying efforts affect policy-is hardly the<br>
domain of any single political party, and unfortunately, is the way of<br>
life in Washington. <br>
There are many reasons why government continues to grow. It would be<br>
naï¿½ve for anyone to expect otherwise. Since 9-11, protection of<br>
privacy, whether medical, personal or financial, has vanished. Free<br>
speech and the Fourth Amendment have been under constant attack.<br>
Higher welfare expenditures are endorsed by the leadership of both<br>
parties. Policing the world and nation-building issues are popular<br>
campaign targets, yet they are now standard operating procedures.<br>
There's no sign that these programs will be slowed or reversed until<br>
either we are stopped by force overseas (which won't be soon) or we go<br>
broke and can no longer afford these grandiose plans for a world empire<br>
(which will probably come sooner than later.)<br>
None of this happened by accident or coincidence. Precise philosophic<br>
ideas prompted certain individuals to gain influence to implement these<br>
plans. The neoconservatives-a name they gave<br>
themselves-diligently worked their way into positions of power and<br>
influence. They documented their goals, strategy and moral<br>
justification for all they hoped to accomplish. Above all else, they<br>
were not and are not conservatives dedicated to limited, constitutional<br>
government.<br>
Neo-conservatism has been around for decades and, strangely, has<br>
connections to past generations as far back as Machiavelli.<br>
Modern-day neo-conservatism was introduced to us in the 1960s. It<br>
entails both a detailed strategy as well as a philosophy of government.<br>
The ideas of Teddy Roosevelt, and certainly Woodrow Wilson, were<br>
quite similar to many of the views of present-day neocons. Neocon<br>
spokesman Max Boot brags that what he advocates is &quot;hard
Wilsonianism.&quot;<br>
In many ways, there's nothing &quot;neo&quot; about their views, and certainly<br>
nothing conservative. Yet they have been able to co-op the<br>
conservative movement by advertising themselves as a new or modern form<br>
of conservatism. <br>
More recently, the modern-day neocons have come from the far left, a<br>
group historically identified as former Trotskyists. Liberal Christopher<br>
Hitchins, has recently officially joined the neocons, and it has been<br>
reported that he has already been to the White House as an ad hoc<br>
consultant. Many neocons now in positions of influence in Washington<br>
can trace their status back to Professor Leo Strauss of the University<br>
of Chicago. One of Strauss' books was Thoughts on Machiavelli.<br>
This book was not a condemnation of Machiavelli's philosophy. Paul<br>
Wolfowitz actually got his PhD under Strauss. Others closely<br>
associated with these views are Richard Perle, Eliot Abrams, Robert<br>
Kagan and William Kristol. All are key players in designing our new<br>
strategy of preemptive war. Others include: Michael Ledeen of the<br>
American Enterprise Institute; former CIA Director James Woolsy; Bill<br>
Bennett of Book of Virtues fame; Frank Gaffney; Dick Cheney; and Donald<br>
Rumsfeld. There are just too many to mention who are philosophically<br>
or politically connected to the neocon philosophy in some varying<br>
degree.<br>
The godfather of modern-day neo-conservatism is considered to be Irving<br>
Kristol, father of Bill Kristol, who set the stage in 1983 with his<br>
publication Reflections of a Neoconservative. In this book, Kristol<br>
also defends the traditional liberal position on welfare. <br>
More important than the names of people affiliated with neo-conservatism<br>
are the views they adhere to. Here is a brief summary of the general<br>
understanding of what neocons believe: <br>
1. They agree with Trotsky on permanent revolution,<br>
violent as well as intellectual. <br>
2. They are for redrawing the map of the Middle East and<br>
are willing to use force to do so.<br>
3. They believe in preemptive war to achieve desired<br>
ends.<br>
4. They accept the notion that the ends justify the<br>
means-that hard-ball politics is a moral necessity.<br>
5. They express no opposition to the welfare state.<br>
6. They are not bashful about an American empire; instead<br>
they strongly endorse it.<br>
7. They believe lying is necessary for the state to<br>
survive.<br>
8. They believe a powerful federal government is a<br>
benefit.<br>
9. They believe pertinent facts about how a society<br>
should be run should be held by the elite and<br>
withheld from those who do not have the courage to deal<br>
with it.<br>
10. They believe neutrality in foreign affairs is ill-advised.<br>
11. They hold Leo Strauss in high esteem.<br>
12. They believe imperialism, if progressive in nature, is<br>
appropriate.<br>
13. Using American might to force American ideals on others is<br>
acceptable. Force should<br>
not be limited to the defense of our country.<br>
14. 9-11 resulted from the lack of foreign entanglements, not from<br>
too many.<br>
15. They dislike and despise libertarians (therefore, the same<br>
applies to all strict constitutionalists.)<br>
16. They endorse attacks on civil liberties, such as those found in<br>
the Patriot Act, as being necessary.<br>
17. They unconditionally support Israel and have a close alliance<br>
with the Likud Party. <br>
Various organizations and publications over the last 30 years have<br>
played a significant role in the rise to power of the neoconservatives.<br>
It took plenty of money and commitment to produce the intellectual<br>
arguments needed to convince the many participants in the movement of<br>
its respectability.<br>
It is no secret-especially after the rash of research and articles<br>
written about the neocons since our invasion of Iraq-how they gained<br>
influence and what organizations were used to promote their cause.<br>
Although for decades, they agitated for their beliefs through<br>
publications like The National Review, The Weekly Standard, The Public<br>
Interest, The Wall Street Journal, Commentary, and the New York Post,<br>
their views only gained momentum in the 1990s following the first<br>
Persian Gulf War-which still has not ended even with removal of Saddam<br>
Hussein. They became convinced that a much more militant approach to<br>
resolving all the conflicts in the Middle East was an absolute<br>
necessity, and they were determined to implement that policy. <br>
In addition to publications, multiple think tanks and projects were<br>
created to promote their agenda. A product of the Bradley Foundation,<br>
American Enterprise Institute (AEI) led the neocon charge, but the real<br>
push for war came from the Project for a New American Century (PNAC)<br>
another organization helped by the Bradley Foundation. This occurred<br>
in 1998 and was chaired by Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol. Early<br>
on, they urged war against Iraq, but were disappointed with the Clinton<br>
administration, which never followed through with its periodic<br>
bombings. Obviously, these bombings were motivated more by Clinton's<br>
personal and political problems than a belief in the neocon agenda. <br>
The election of 2000 changed all that. The Defense Policy Board,<br>
chaired by Richard Perle played no small role in coordinating the<br>
various projects and think tanks, all determined to take us into war<br>
against Iraq. It wasn't too long before the dream of empire was<br>
brought closer to reality by the election of 2000 with Paul Wolfowitz,<br>
Richard Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld playing key roles in this<br>
accomplishment. The plan to promote an &quot;American greatness&quot;<br>
imperialistic foreign policy was now a distinct possibility. Iraq<br>
offered a great opportunity to prove their long-held theories. This<br>
opportunity was a consequence of the 9-11 disaster.<br>
The money and views of Rupert Murdock also played a key role in<br>
promoting the neocon views, as well as rallying support by the general<br>
population, through his News Corporation, which owns Fox News Network,<br>
the New York Post and Weekly Standard. This powerful and influential<br>
media empire did more to galvanize public support for the Iraqi invasion<br>
than one might imagine. This facilitated the Rumsfeld/Cheney policy<br>
as their plans to attack Iraq came to fruition. It would have been<br>
difficult for the neocons to usurp foreign policy from the restraints of<br>
Colin Powell's State Department without the successful agitation of the<br>
Rupert Murdock empire. Max Boot was satisfied, as he explained:<br>
&quot;Neoconservatives believe in using American might to promote American<br>
ideals abroad.&quot; This attitude is a far cry from the advice of the<br>
Founders, who advocated no entangling alliances and neutrality as the<br>
proper goal of American foreign policy.<br>
Let there be no doubt, those in the neocon camp had been anxious to go<br>
to war against Iraq for a decade. They justified the use of force to<br>
accomplish their goals, even if it required preemptive war. If anyone<br>
doubts this assertion, they need only to read of their strategy in &quot;A<br>
Clean Break: a New Strategy for Securing the Realm.&quot; Although they<br>
felt morally justified in changing the government in Iraq, they knew<br>
that public support was important, and justification had to be given to<br>
pursue the war. Of course, a threat to us had to exist before the<br>
people and the Congress would go along with war. The majority of<br>
Americans became convinced of this threat, which, in actuality, never<br>
really existed. Now we have the ongoing debate over the location of<br>
weapons of mass destruction. Where was the danger? Was all this<br>
killing and spending necessary? How long will this nation-building and<br>
dying go on? When will we become more concerned about the needs of<br>
our own citizens than the problems we sought in Iraq and Afghanistan?<br>
Who knows where we'll go next-Iran, Syria or North Korea?<br>
At the end of the Cold War, the neoconservatives realized a<br>
rearrangement of the world was occurring and that our superior economic<br>
and military power offered them a perfect opportunity to control the<br>
process of remaking the Middle East.<br>
It was recognized that a new era was upon us, and the neocons welcomed<br>
Frances Fukuyama's &quot;end of history&quot; declaration. To them, the debate<br>
was over. The West won; the Soviets lost. Old-fashioned communism<br>
was dead. Long live the new era of neoconservatism. The struggle may<br>
not be over, but the West won the intellectual fight, they reasoned. The<br>
only problem is that the neocons decided to define the philosophy of the<br>
victors. They have been amazingly successful in their efforts to<br>
control the debate over what Western values are and by what methods they<br>
will be spread throughout the world. <br>
Communism surely lost a lot with the breakup of the Soviet Empire, but<br>
this can hardly be declared a victory for American liberty, as the<br>
Founders understood it. Neoconservatism is not the philosophy of free<br>
markets and a wise foreign policy. Instead, it represents big-government<br>
welfare at home and a program of using our military might to spread<br>
their version of American values throughout the world. Since<br>
neoconservatives dominate the way the U.S. government now operates, it<br>
behooves us all to understand their beliefs and goals. The breakup of<br>
the Soviet system may well have been an epic event but to say that the<br>
views of the neocons are the unchallenged victors and that all we need<br>
do is wait for their implementation is a capitulation to controlling the<br>
forces of history that many Americans are not yet ready to concede.<br>
There is surely no need to do so. <br>
There is now a recognized philosophic connection between modern-day<br>
neoconservatives and Irving Kristol, Leo Strauss and Machiavelli.<br>
This is important in understanding that today's policies and the<br>
subsequent problems will be with us for years to come if these policies<br>
are not reversed. <br>
Not only did Leo Strauss write favorably of Machiavelli, Michael Ledeen,<br>
a current leader of the neoconservative movement, did the same. In<br>
1999, Ledeen titled his book, Machiavelli on Modern Leadership, and<br>
subtitled: Why Machiaveli's iron rules are as timely and important today<br>
as five centuries ago. Ledeen is indeed an influential neocon<br>
theorist whose views get lots of attention today in Washington. His book<br>
on Machiavelli, interestingly enough, was passed out to Members of<br>
Congress attending a political strategy meeting shortly after its<br>
publication and at just about the time A Clean Break was issued. <br>
In Ledeen's most recent publication, The War Against the Terror Masters,<br>
he reiterates his beliefs outlined in this 1999 Machaivelli book. He<br>
specifically praises: &quot;Creative destruction.both within our own<br>
society and abroad.(foreigners) seeing America undo traditional<br>
societies may fear us, for they do not wish to be undone.&quot; Amazingly,<br>
Ledeen concludes: &quot;They must attack us in order to survive, just as we<br>
must destroy them to advance our historic mission.&quot;<br>
If those words don't scare you, nothing will. If they are not a clear<br>
warning, I don't know what could be. It sounds like both sides of<br>
each disagreement in the world will be following the principle of<br>
preemptive war. The world is certainly a less safe place for it.<br>
In Machiavelli on Modern Leadership, Ledeen praises a business leader<br>
for correctly understanding Machiavelli: &quot;There are no absolute<br>
solutions. It all depends. What is right and what is wrong depends<br>
on what needs to be done and how.&quot; This is a clear endorsement of<br>
situation ethics and is not coming from the traditional left. It<br>
reminds me of: &quot;It depends on what the definition of the word 'is'
is.&quot;<br>
Ledeen quotes Machiavelli approvingly on what makes a great leader. &quot;A<br>
prince must have no other objectives or other thoughts or take anything<br>
for his craft, except war.&quot; To Ledeen, this meant: &quot;.the virtue of<br>
the warrior are those of great leaders of any successful organization.&quot;<br>
Yet it's obvious that war is not coincidental to neocon philosophy,<br>
but an integral part. The intellectuals justify it, and the<br>
politicians carry it out. There's a precise reason to argue for war<br>
over peace according to Ledeen, for &quot;.peace increases our peril by<br>
making discipline less urgent, encouraging some of our worst instincts,<br>
in depriving us of some of our best leaders.&quot; Peace, he claims, is a<br>
dream and not even a pleasant one, for it would cause indolence and<br>
would undermine the power of the state. Although I concede the<br>
history of the world is a history of frequent war, to capitulate and<br>
give up even striving for peace-believing peace is not a benefit to<br>
mankind-is a frightening thought that condemns the world to perpetual<br>
war and justifies it as a benefit and necessity. These are dangerous<br>
ideas, from which no good can come. <br>
The conflict of the ages has been between the state and the individual:<br>
central power versus liberty. The more restrained the state and the<br>
more emphasis on individual liberty, the greater has been the<br>
advancement of civilization and general prosperity. Just as man's<br>
condition was not locked in place by the times and wars of old and<br>
improved with liberty and free markets, there's no reason to believe a<br>
new stage for man might not be achieved by believing and working for<br>
conditions of peace. The inevitability and so-called need for<br>
preemptive war should never be intellectually justified as being a<br>
benefit. Such an attitude guarantees the backsliding of civilization.<br>
Neocons, unfortunately, claim that war is in man's nature and that we<br>
can't do much about it, so let's use it to our advantage by promoting<br>
our goodness around the world through force of arms. That view is<br>
anathema to the cause of liberty and the preservation of the<br>
Constitution. If it is not loudly refuted, our future will be dire<br>
indeed. <br>
Ledeen believes man is basically evil and cannot be left to his own<br>
desires. Therefore, he must have proper and strong leadership, just<br>
as Machiavelli argued. Only then can man achieve good, as Ledeen<br>
explains: &quot;In order to achieve the most noble accomplishments, the<br>
leader may have to 'enter into evil.' This is the chilling insight<br>
that has made Machiavelli so feared, admired and challenging. We are<br>
rotten,&quot; argues Ledeen. &quot;It's true that we can achieve greatness if,<br>
and only if, we are properly led.&quot; In other words, man is so depraved<br>
that individuals are incapable of moral, ethical and spiritual<br>
greatness, and achieving excellence and virtue can only come from a<br>
powerful authoritarian leader. What depraved ideas are these to now<br>
be influencing our leaders in Washington? The question Ledeen doesn't<br>
answer is: &quot;Why do the political leaders not suffer from the same<br>
shortcomings and where do they obtain their monopoly on wisdom?&quot;<br>
Once this trust is placed in the hands of a powerful leader, this neocon<br>
argues that certain tools are permissible to use. For instance:<br>
&quot;lying is central to the survival of nations and to the success of great<br>
enterprises, because if our enemies can count on the reliability of<br>
everything you say, your vulnerability is enormously increased.&quot; What<br>
about the effects of lying on one's own people? Who cares if a leader<br>
can fool the enemy? Does calling it &quot;strategic deception&quot; make lying<br>
morally justifiable? Ledeen and Machiavelli argue that it does, as<br>
long as the survivability of the state is at stake. Preserving the<br>
state is their goal, even if the personal liberty of all individuals has<br>
to be suspended or canceled.<br>
Ledeen makes it clear that war is necessary to establish national<br>
boundaries-because that's the way it's always been done. Who needs<br>
progress of the human race! He explains: &quot;Look at the map of the<br>
world: national boundaries have not been drawn by peaceful men<br>
leading lives of spiritual contemplation. National boundaries have<br>
been established by war, and national character has been shaped by<br>
struggle, most often bloody struggle.&quot;<br>
Yes, but who is to lead the charge and decide which borders we are to<br>
fight for? What about borders 6,000 miles away unrelated to our own<br>
contiguous borders and our own national security? Stating a relative<br>
truism regarding the frequency of war throughout history should hardly<br>
be the moral justification for expanding the concept of war to settle<br>
man's disputes. How can one call this progress? <br>
Machiavelli, Ledeen and the neocons recognized a need to generate a<br>
religious zeal for promoting the state. This, he claims, is<br>
especially necessary when force is used to promote an agenda. It's<br>
been true throughout history and remains true today, each side of major<br>
conflicts invokes God's approval. Our side refers to a &quot;crusade;&quot;<br>
theirs to a &quot;holy Jihad.&quot; Too often wars boil down to their god<br>
against our God. It seems this principle is more a cynical effort to<br>
gain approval from the masses, especially those most likely to be killed<br>
for the sake of the war promoters on both sides who have power, prestige<br>
and wealth at stake.<br>
Ledeen explains why God must always be on the side of advocates of war:<br>
&quot;Without fear of God, no state can last long, for the dread of eternal<br>
damnation keeps men in line, causes them to honor their promises, and<br>
inspires them to risk their lives for the common good.&quot; It seems<br>
dying for the common good has gained a higher moral status than eternal<br>
salvation of one's soul. Ledeen adds: &quot;Without fear of punishment,<br>
men will not obey laws that force them to act contrary to their<br>
passions. Without fear of arms, the state cannot enforce the<br>
laws.to this end, Machiavelli wants leaders to make the state<br>
spectacular.&quot;<br>
It's of interest to note that some large Christian denominations have<br>
joined the neoconservatives in promoting preemptive war, while<br>
completely ignoring the Christian doctrine of a Just War. The neocons<br>
sought and openly welcomed their support.<br>
I'd like someone to glean anything from what the Founders said or placed<br>
in the Constitution that agrees with this now-professed doctrine of a<br>
&quot;spectacular&quot; state promoted by those who now have so much influence
on<br>
our policies here at home and abroad. Ledeen argues that this<br>
religious element, this fear of God, is needed for discipline of those<br>
who may be hesitant to sacrifice their lives for the good of the<br>
&quot;spectacular state.&quot;<br>
He explains in eerie terms: &quot;Dying for one's country doesn't come<br>
naturally. Modern armies, raised from the populace, must be inspired,<br>
motivated, indoctrinated. Religion is central to the military<br>
enterprise, for men are more likely to risk their lives if they believe<br>
they will be rewarded forever after for serving their country.&quot; This<br>
is an admonition that might just as well have been given by Osama bin<br>
Laden, in rallying his troops to sacrifice their lives to kill the<br>
invading infidels, as by our intellectuals at AEI, who greatly influence<br>
our foreign policy.<br>
Neocons-anxious for the U.S. to use force to realign the boundaries<br>
and change regimes in the Middle East-clearly understand the benefit<br>
of a galvanizing and emotional event to rally the people to their cause.<br>
Without a special event, they realized the difficulty in selling<br>
their policy of preemptive war where our own military personnel would be<br>
killed. Whether it was the Lusitania, Pearl Harbor, the Gulf of<br>
Tonkin or the Maine, all served their purpose in promoting a war that<br>
was sought by our leaders.<br>
Ledeen writes of a fortuitous event (1999): &quot;.of course, we can always<br>
get lucky. Stunning events from outside can providentially awaken the<br>
enterprise from its growing torpor, and demonstrate the need for<br>
reversal, as the devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 so<br>
effectively aroused the U.S. from its soothing dreams of permanent<br>
neutrality.&quot;<br>
Amazingly, Ledeen calls Pearl Harbor a &quot;lucky&quot; event. The Project for<br>
a New American Century, as recently as September 2000, likewise, foresaw<br>
the need for &quot;a Pearl Harbor event&quot; that would galvanize the American<br>
people to support their ambitious plans to ensure political and economic<br>
domination of the world, while strangling any potential &quot;rival.&quot;<br>
Recognizing a &quot;need&quot; for a Pearl Harbor event, and referring to Pearl<br>
Harbor as being &quot;lucky&quot; are not identical to support and knowledge of<br>
such an event, but that this sympathy for a galvanizing event, as 9-11<br>
turned out to be, was used to promote an agenda that strict<br>
constitutionalists and devotees of the Founders of this nation find<br>
appalling, is indeed disturbing. After 9-11, Rumsfield and others argued<br>
for an immediate attack on Iraq, even though it was not implicated in<br>
the attacks.<br>
The fact that neo-conservatives ridicule those who firmly believe that<br>
U.S. interests and world peace would best be served by a policy of<br>
neutrality and avoiding foreign entanglements should not go<br>
unchallenged. Not to do so is to condone their grandiose plans for an<br>
American world hegemony.<br>
The current attention given neocons usually comes in the context of<br>
foreign policy. But there's more to what's going on today than just<br>
the tremendous influence the neocons have on our new policy of<br>
preemptive war with a goal of empire. Our government is now being<br>
moved by several ideas that come together in what I call &quot;neoconism.&quot;<br>
The foreign policy is being openly debated, even if its implications<br>
are not fully understood by many who support it. Washington is now<br>
driven by old views brought together in a new package.<br>
We know those who lead us-both in the administration and in<br>
Congress-show no appetite to challenge the tax or monetary systems<br>
that do so much damage to our economy. The IRS and the Federal<br>
Reserve are off limits for criticism or reform. There's no resistance<br>
to spending, either domestic or foreign. Debt is not seen as a<br>
problem. The supply-siders won on this issue, and now many<br>
conservatives readily endorse deficit spending. <br>
There's no serious opposition to the expanding welfare state, with rapid<br>
growth of the education, agriculture and medical-care bureaucracy.<br>
Support for labor unions and protectionism are not uncommon. Civil<br>
liberties are easily sacrificed in the post 9-11 atmosphere prevailing<br>
in Washington. Privacy issues are of little concern, except for a few<br>
members of Congress. Foreign aid and internationalism-in spite of<br>
some healthy criticism of the UN and growing concerns for our national<br>
sovereignty-are championed on both sides of the aisle. Lip service<br>
is given to the free market and free trade, yet the entire economy is<br>
run by special-interest legislation favoring big business, big labor<br>
and, especially, big money. <br>
Instead of the &quot;end of history,&quot; we are now experiencing the end of a<br>
vocal limited-government movement in our nation's capital. While most<br>
conservatives no longer defend balanced budgets and reduced spending,<br>
most liberals have grown lazy in defending civil liberties and now are<br>
approving wars that we initiate. The so-called &quot;third way&quot; has<br>
arrived and, sadly, it has taken the worst of what the conservatives and<br>
liberals have to offer. The people are less well off for it, while<br>
liberty languishes as a result.<br>
Neocons enthusiastically embrace the Department of Education and<br>
national testing. Both parties overwhelmingly support the huge<br>
commitment to a new prescription drug program. Their devotion to the new<br>
approach called &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; has lured many<br>
conservatives into supporting programs for expanding the federal role in<br>
welfare and in church charities. The faith-based initiative is a<br>
neocon project, yet it only repackages and expands the liberal notion of<br>
welfare. The intellectuals who promoted these initiatives were<br>
neocons, but there's nothing conservative about expanding the federal<br>
government's role in welfare.<br>
The supply-siders' policy of low-marginal tax rates has been<br>
incorporated into neoconism, as well as their support for easy money and<br>
generous monetary inflation. Neoconservatives are disinterested in the<br>
gold standard and even ignore the supply-siders' argument for a phony<br>
gold standard.<br>
Is it any wonder that federal government spending is growing at a rate<br>
faster than in any time in the past 35 years?<br>
Power, politics and privilege prevail over the rule of law, liberty,<br>
justice and peace. But it does not need to be that way. Neoconism has<br>
brought together many old ideas about how government should rule the<br>
people. It may have modernized its appeal and packaging, but<br>
authoritarian rule is authoritarian rule, regardless of the humanitarian<br>
overtones. A solution can only come after the current ideology<br>
driving our government policies is replaced with a more positive one.<br>
In a historical context, liberty is a modern idea and must once again<br>
regain the high moral ground for civilization to advance. Restating<br>
the old justifications for war, people control and a benevolent state<br>
will not suffice. It cannot eliminate the shortcomings that always<br>
occur when the state assumes authority over others and when the will of<br>
one nation is forced on another-whether or not it is done with good<br>
intentions.<br>
I realize that all conservatives are not neoconservatives, and all<br>
neocons don't necessarily agree on all points-which means that in<br>
spite of their tremendous influence, most members of Congress and those<br>
in the administration do not necessarily take their marching orders from<br>
AEI or Richard Perle. But to use this as a reason to ignore what<br>
neoconservative leaders believe, write about and agitate for-with<br>
amazing success I might point out-would be at our own peril. This<br>
country still allows open discourse-though less everyday-and we who<br>
disagree should push the discussion and expose those who drive our<br>
policies. It is getting more difficult to get fair and balanced<br>
discussion on the issues, because it has become routine for the hegemons<br>
to label those who object to preemptive war and domestic surveillance as<br>
traitors, unpatriotic and un-American. The uniformity of support for<br>
our current foreign policy by major and cable-news networks should<br>
concern every American. We should all be thankful for C-SPAN and the<br>
Internet.<br>
Michael Ledeen and other neoconservatives are already lobbying for war<br>
against Iran. Ledeen is pretty nasty to those who call for a calmer,<br>
reasoned approach by calling those who are not ready for war &quot;cowards<br>
and appeasers of tyrants.&quot; Because some urge a less militaristic<br>
approach to dealing with Iran, he claims they are betraying America's<br>
best &quot;traditions.&quot; I wonder where he learned early American history!<br>
It's obvious that Ledeen doesn't consider the Founders and the<br>
Constitution part of our best traditions. We were hardly encouraged<br>
by the American revolutionaries to pursue an American empire. We<br>
were, however, urged to keep the Republic they so painstakingly<br>
designed.<br>
If the neoconservatives retain control of the conservative,<br>
limited-government movement in Washington, the ideas, once championed by<br>
conservatives, of limiting the size and scope of government will be a<br>
long-forgotten dream. <br>
The believers in liberty ought not deceive themselves. Who should be<br>
satisfied? Certainly not conservatives, for there is no conservative<br>
movement left. How could liberals be satisfied? They are pleased<br>
with the centralization of education and medical programs in Washington<br>
and support many of the administration's proposals. But none should<br>
be pleased with the steady attack on the civil liberties of all American<br>
citizens and the now-accepted consensus that preemptive war-for almost<br>
any reason-is an acceptable policy for dealing with all the conflicts<br>
and problems of the world.<br>
In spite of the deteriorating conditions in Washington-with loss of<br>
personal liberty, a weak economy, exploding deficits, and perpetual war,<br>
followed by nation building-there are still quite a number of us who<br>
would relish the opportunity to improve things, in one way or another.<br>
Certainly, a growing number of frustrated Americans, from both the<br>
right and the left, are getting anxious to see this Congress do a better<br>
job. But first, Congress must stop doing a bad job.<br>
We're at the point where we need a call to arms, both here in Washington<br>
and across the country. I'm not talking about firearms. Those of<br>
us who care need to raise both arms and face our palms out and begin<br>
waving and shouting: Stop! Enough is enough! It should include<br>
liberals, conservatives and independents. We're all getting a bum rap<br>
from politicians who are pushed by polls and controlled by<br>
special-interest money.<br>
One thing is certain, no matter how morally justified the programs and<br>
policies seem, the ability to finance all the guns and butter being<br>
promised is limited, and those limits are becoming more apparent every<br>
day. <br>
Spending, borrowing and printing money cannot be the road to prosperity.<br>
It hasn't worked in Japan, and it isn't working here either. As a<br>
matter of fact, it's never worked anytime throughout history. A point<br>
is always reached where government planning, spending and inflation run<br>
out of steam. Instead of these old tools reviving an economy, as they<br>
do in the early stages of economic interventionism, they eventually<br>
become the problem. Both sides of the political spectrum must one day<br>
realize that limitless government intrusion in the economy, in our<br>
personal lives and in the affairs of other nations cannot serve the best<br>
interests of America. This is not a conservative problem, nor is it a<br>
liberal problem-it's a government intrusion problem that comes from<br>
both groups, albeit for different reasons. The problems emanate from<br>
both camps who champion different programs for different reasons. The<br>
solution will come when both groups realize that it's not merely a<br>
single-party problem, or just a liberal or just a conservative problem.<br>
Once enough of us decide we've had enough of all these so-called good<br>
things that the government is always promising-or more likely, when<br>
the country is broke and the government is unable to fulfill its<br>
promises to the people-we can start a serious discussion on the proper<br>
role for government in a free society. Unfortunately, it will be some<br>
time before Congress gets the message that the people are demanding true<br>
reform. This requires that those responsible for today's problems are<br>
exposed and their philosophy of pervasive government intrusion is<br>
rejected.<br>
Let it not be said that no one cared, that no one objected once it's<br>
realized that our liberties and wealth are in jeopardy. A few have,<br>
and others will continue to do so, but too many-both in and out of<br>
government-close their eyes to the issue of personal liberty and<br>
ignore the fact that endless borrowing to finance endless demands cannot<br>
be sustained. True prosperity can only come from a healthy economy<br>
and sound money. That can only be achieved in a free society. <br>

shades of Hillary Clinton's Medicare reform fiasco!<br>
We 40 million seniors do depend on pharmaceuticals for our health and
well-being, however, most of us are capable of paying for drugs and do<br>
not need a new entitlement program. When will dependency on Uncle Sugar ever
end?<br>
Fewer than 20 percent of seniors need such a plan to help them with drug costs.
In fact, many who do not have medical or pharmaceutical coverage<br>
could afford to pay for a substantial plan but choose NOT to do so. The
deserving citizens who meet the poverty test already have Medicaid, and<br>
very few seniors do not have Medicare in its present form. The proposed plan to
help seniors pay for pharmaceuticals will, in many instances, be a windfall
that allows employers who now have a commitment to provide substantial portions
of health insurance premiums for retirees off the hook. This would shift the
burden to you, the taxpayer. Furthermore, this bill will be costly and provide
limited benefits. We must not allow this bill to be enacted. As a life-long
Republican, I am disappointed. Passage of this will be a serious mistake. And
for sure another welfare program in disguise. Bk<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Though it's generally those of the liberal persuasion who use the following
argument. They do<br>
claim that the only reason employers prefer illegal aliens is that they are
cheaper. Personally I believe that this claim is quite false. Here in the deep
south my eyes tell me another story, as I drive by or visit parks and
recreation areas where the white and other children, for the most part are
being attended and watched over by latins. Boy! Have times changed! in domestic
service, where blacks were often employed in the past, almost everyone is
hiring immigrants from Latin America or Asia whether legal or not. The
perception is that they have a better attitude and are more honest and
reliable. Here is a question that will incur the wrath of the black community.
If you needed to hire a nursemaid for your children, or help in your home,
would you hire a black woman today? I would bet my bottom dollar that without
much thought you would not. I would also hazard the thought it wouldn't have
anything to do with salary. Even in my own area I see more and more latins ( I
only know because they are all speaking their native language) as they go about
their jobs of lawn and garden maintenance, along with watching the childen.
They do good work and they have a pleasant attitude. You don't feel at risk to
have them around your property. It has nothing to do with money. It does seem
to have as a underlying reason we white Americans tend to like and trust Asians
and Latinos. These days (the white community feels intimidated by blacks) so we
prefer not to have them around. Whites have finally realized that most (not
all) blacks have long harboured a innate disdain for the white man, and do not
like us much. So the bottom line for the Jacksons and Sharptons, along with
Maxine of California, has to be dislike us if you will, but have that include
our money also! You can do all the whinning and civil unrest that you seem to
thrive on. However most of us whites refuse to continue subsidizing these
activities. Big Kahuna--------- Please give me hell if you disagree!!!!

Hey, looks like not all the trillions of laws on the books are there just to
harass you and me. The National Taxpayers Union has discovered that there's at
least one law that targets our congressmen. A federal statue that says congress
critters who abscond from their congressional duties must forfeit pay unless
they're out sick. <br>
According to 2 U.S. Code 39, &quot;The Secretary of the Senate and the Chief
Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, respectively,<br>
shall deduct from the monthly payments (or other periodic payments authorized
by law) of each Member or Delegate the amount of his salary<br>
for each day that he has been absent. . . .&quot; <br>
How revolutionary it would be to follow this law! Congressmen would have to
work for their pay too, just like the rest of us. Just as we are not<br>
allowed to charge for the time we spend going on job interviews, so they would
not be allowed to charge for the time they spend campaigning for<br>
reelection. <br>
Well, it's only fair. These guys are already using our tax monies to pay for
franking privileges, for congressional office workers who double as<br>
campaign workers, and for all the other taxpayer-funded incumbent advantages.
So if we can save a little bit on their ever-increasing salaries, I think
that's just great. <br>
But wait just a minute . . . . Let's think this over. After all, considering
all the damage these people tend to do when they are in attendance and voting
on bills and passing bills . . . maybe what we should really be doing is paying
them to stay away . . . . <br>
This is Common Sense. I'm Paul Jacob.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>However does anyone really give a damn? All
the bleeding hearts just recently came out of the woodwork when the news of the
recent tragic deaths of 19 illegal immigrants who suffocated in a&nbsp; trailer
while being smuggled into our country. Now would be a most opportune time to
give serious thought to all the factors that contributed to this tragedy,
brought on by those trying to break our laws. Please remember in most places
they are refereed to as CRIMINALS!! I for one don't for a moment question that
the smugglers are to blame in these deaths. They along with the illegals broke
the law. The gross negligence shown in the care of their poor lawbreaking human
cargo, is only another facet of this criminal act! There is no question that
the illegal immigrants (LAWBREAKERS of OUR Laws!) were victims of untimely and
horrible deaths.<br>
Just the same, they were in that tractor trailer voluntarily to escape
detection, as they willingly broke the law to enter the United States. This was
all done by their own choice! This was a plan to come into our country illegally,
to get American jobs for their own economic benefit, along with partaking of
the liberal welfare and aid programs offered here. So they feel the hell with
the laws of the United States. With an opinion that is shared by many, I think
these illegals do not want to try to immigrate legally, because this would
place them under the scrutiny of our immigration system,poor as it is. That
system requires certain conditions to be met before an immigrant is accepted
for admission, and the vast majority of the illegal immigrants do not meet
those conditions,or have any desire to do so! Fellow taxpayers you might wish
to give this some thought. There is no question Mexican government and the
United States government are falling woefully short in any attempt to bring to
a halt this illegal immigration situation.<br>
Mr.Fox and the Mexican government ( they feel that the western part of the
United States was stolen from them and this is just the beginning of<br>
their plan to take it back). Be aware they are also encouraging illegal
immigration by issuing the so-called matricula consular cards to the<br>
illegals for use as identification in the United States. Believe it or not
there are some&nbsp;&nbsp; government agencies and an increasing number of<br>
businesses in the United States honoring these cards as if they were legitimate
ID. These cards are not visas, and do not constitute proof that a Mexican
citizen is in our country legally. Our officials are not doing all they can to
enforce these laws. So, the aspiring illegal immigrants get the idea(wouldn't
you?) that Americans will do little to stop them (and we don't) from staying
here once they are in, thus fuelling further illegal entry. <br>
Additionally, some unscrupulous businesses entice illegal workers so that they
can pay them less wages for work that could have gone to an<br>
American citizen. These businesses are being inadequately punished for their
misdeeds. <br>
Our government needs to send a strong message (NOW) to the people of Mexico by
outlawing the use of the matricula consular cards. There is<br>
legislation being drafted right now. Lets see if the vote seeking liberal
bleeding hearts will allow this to pass? Our homeland security<br>
officials need the funds to round up illegal aliens and get them back to their
own countries. Smugglers and employers of illegal aliens should be<br>
punished effectively and harshly to discourage future offenses.&nbsp; Big

themselves and there are many of these heart rending stories. They then should
fall into the province of the many private charities that abound and always
seem to be begging for more money! I suspect this would cost much less than the
government programs being proposed? Would it be wrong for drug companies to
compete in an open market? Without federal (TAXPAYER) subsidies of any kind or
description! We must all, not we seniors alone, stop treating the federal
treasury as our own private trough! It is money from us all young and old. What
ever happened to that old ethic of families taking care of their own? The many

intense pressure from radical homosexual and atheist rights groups in our area
and nationwide. I am totally aghast that there has now been a vote taken by the
The Philadelphia Council Boy Scouts of America executive board, in the Cradle
of American Liberty. That Boy Scout Council has voted to include 'sexual
orientation' in its nondiscrimination code. (Def: allowing deviants and others
that adhere to a lifestyle totally unacceptable to the Boy Scout code.)
Rejecting the concept of 'moral straightness' is an OUTRAGEOUS move on their
part. When it comes to a Scout troop, sexual orientation is an issue that goes
beyond differences in skin color or economic status. It affects such matters as
tenting arrangements and the development of pre-teenage masculinity in a
close-knit group of boys and men. But the BSA's position against homosexuality
is not just an issue of moral principle in an effort to affirm the Scout Oath
and Law, it is a serious safety effort to prevent cases of sexual abuse and
harassment.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

Native Americans, and inner city children. And Scouting has also taught the
difference between right and wrong, (a concept often passed over in today's
society) between honor and indecency, between justice and perversity. Until
now. The BSA's standards have been highly respected for over 90 years. As
American citizens, we have an obligation to see to it that the Boy Scout Oath
and Law are upheld for another 90 years. We seem to be unable to change the
lifestyle of the deviants, however that and they shouldn't be allowed to infect

of the men who are pictured on that statue, and a little about them. Iwo Jima
Six Boys -<br>
Each year I am hired to go to Washington, DC, with the eighth grade class from
Clinton, WI, where I grew up, to videotape their trip. I greatly enjoy visiting
our nation's capitol, and each year I take some special memories back with me.
This fall's trip was especially<br>
memorable. <br>
On the last night of our trip, we stopped at the Iwo Jima Memorial. This
memorial is the largest bronze statue in the world and depicts one of the most
famous photographs in history -- that of the six brave soldiers raising the
American Flag at the top of a rocky hill on the island of Iwo Jima, Japan,
during WW II. <br>
Over one hundred students and chaperones piled off the buses and headed towards
the memorial. I noticed a solitary figure at the base of the statue, and as I
got closer he asked, &quot;Where are you guys from?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>I told him that we were from Wisconsin. <br>
&quot;Hey, I'm a cheesehead, too! Come gather around, Cheeseheads, and I will
tell you a story.&quot; (James Bradley just happened to be in Washington, DC,
to speak at the memorial the following day. He was there that night to say good
night to his dad, who has since passed away. He was just about to leave when he
saw the buses pull up. I videotaped him as he spoke to us, and received his
permission to share what he said from my videotape. It is one thing to tour the
incredible monuments filled with history in Washington, D.C., but it is quite
another to get the kind of insight we received that night.) When all had
gathered around, he reverently began to speak. (Here are his words that night.)
<br>
&quot;My name is James Bradley and I'm from Antigo, Wisconsin. My dad is on
that statue, and I just wrote a book called &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;
which is #5 on the New York Times Best Seller list right now. It is the story
of the six boys you see behind me. &quot;Six boys raised the flag. The first
guy putting the pole in the ground is Harlon Block. Harlon was an all-state football
player. He enlisted in the Marine Corps with all the senior members of his
football team. They were off to play another type of game. A game called
&quot;War.&quot; But it didn't turn out to be a game. Harlon, at the age of 21,
died with his intestines in his hands. I don't say that to gross you out, I say
that because there are generals who stand in front of this statue and talk
about the glory of war. You guys need to know that most of the boys in Iwo Jima
were 17, 18, and 19 years old. <br>
(He pointed to the statue) &quot;You see this next guy? That's Rene Gagnon from
New Hampshire. If you took Rene's helmet off at the moment this photo was taken
and looked in the webbing of that helmet, you would find a photograph ... a
photograph of his girlfriend. Rene put that in there for protection because he
was scared. He was 18 years old. Boys won the battle of Iwo Jima. Boys. Not old
men. <br>
&quot;The next guy here, the third guy in this tableau, was Sergeant Mike
Strank. Mike is my hero. He was the hero of all these guys. They called him the
&quot;old man&quot; because he was so old. He was already 24. When Mike would
motivate his boys in training camp, he didn't say, 'Let's go kill some
Japanese' or 'Let's die for our country.' He knew he was talking to little
boys. Instead he would say, 'You do what I say, and I'll get you home to your
mothers.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span><br>
&quot;The last guy on this side of the statue is Ira Hayes, a Pima Indian from
Arizona. Ira Hayes walked off Iwo Jima. He went into the White House with my
dad. President Truman told him, 'You're a hero.' He told reporters, 'How can
feel I like a hero when 250 of my buddies hit the island with me and only 27 of
us walked off alive?' <br>
So you take your class at school, 250 of you spending a year together having
fun, doing everything together. Then all 250 of you hit the beach, but only 27
of your classmates walk off alive. That was Ira Hayes. He had images of horror
in his mind. Ira Hayes died dead drunk, face down at the age of 32 ... ten
years after this picture was taken. <br>
&quot;The next guy, going around the statue, is Franklin Sousley from Hilltop,
Kentucky. A fun-lovin' hillbilly boy. His best friend, who is now 70, told me,
'Yeah, you know, we took two cows up on the porch of the Hilltop General Store.
Then we strung wire across the stairs so the cows couldn't get down. Then we
fed them Epsom salts. Those cows crapped all night.' Yes, he was a fun-lovin'
hillbilly boy. Franklin died on Iwo Jima at the age of 19. When the telegram
came to tell his mother that he was dead, it went to the Hilltop General Store.
A barefoot boy ran that telegram up to his mother's farm. The neighbors could
hear her scream all night and into the morning. The neighbors lived a quarter
of a mile away. <br>
&quot;The next guy, as we continue to go around the statue, is my dad, John
Bradley from Antigo, Wisconsin, where I was raised. My dad lived until 1994,
but he would never give interviews. When Walter Cronkite's producers, or the
New York Times would call, we were trained as little kids to say, 'No, I'm
sorry, sir, my dad's not here. He is in Canada fishing. No, there is no phone
there, sir. No, we don't know when he is coming back.' My dad never fished or
even went to Canada. Usually, he was sitting there right at the table eating
his Campbell's soup. But we had to tell the press that he was out fishing. He
didn't want to talk to the press. &quot;You see, my dad didn't see himself as a
hero. Everyone thinks these guys are heroes, 'cause they are in a photo and a
monument. My dad knew better. He was a medic. John Bradley from Wisconsin was a
caregiver. In Iwo Jima he probably held over 200 boys as they died. And when
boys died in Iwo Jima, they writhed and screamed in pain. <br>
&quot;When I was a little boy, my third grade teacher told me that my dad was a
hero. When I went home and told my dad that, he looked at me and said, 'I want
you always to remember that the heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who did not
come back. Did NOT come back.' &quot;So that's the story about six nice young
boys. Three died on Iwo Jima, and three came back as national heroes. Overall, 7,000
boys died on Iwo Jima in the worst<br>
battle in the history of the Marine Corps. My voice is giving out, so I will
end here. Thank you for your time.&quot; <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

nonetheless. We need to remember that God created this vast and glorious world

A: The Democratic party.<br>
Q: Which party increased the tax on Social Security?<br>
A: The Democratic Party with Al Gore casting the deciding vote.<br>
Q: Which party decided to give money to immigrants?<br>
A: That's right, immigrants moved into this country and at 65 got SSI Social
Security. The Democratic Party gave that to them although they never paid a
dime into it. Then, after doing all this, the Democrats turn around and tell
you the Republicans want to take your Social Security. And the worst part about
it is, people believe it! Pass it on please! <br>
2004 Election Issue <br>
This must be an issue in &quot;04&quot;. Please! Keep it going. SOCIAL
SECURITY: <br>
(This is worth the read. It's short and to the point.) Perhaps we are asking
the wrong questions during election years. Our Senators and Congressmen
&amp;women do not pay into Social Security and, of course, they do not collect
from it. <br>
You see, Social Security benefits were not suitable for persons of their rare
elevation in society. They felt they should have a special plan for themselves.
So, many years ago they voted in their own benefit plan. In more recent years,
no congress person has felt the need to change it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">ï¿½ </span>After all, it is a great plan. <br>
For all practical purposes their plan works like this: When they retire, they
continue to draw the same pay until they die, except it may increase from time
to time for cost of living adjustments. For example, former Senator Byrd and
Congressman White and their wives may expect to draw $7,800,000.00 (that's
Seven Million, Eight-Hundred Thousand<br>
Dollars), with their wives drawing $275,000.00 during the last years of their
lives. <br>
This is calculated on an average life span for each. Their cost for this
excellent plan is $00.00. Nada. Zilch. This little perk they voted for
themselves is free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan. The funds
for this fine retirement plan come directly from the General Funds-our tax
dollars at work! From our own Social Security Plan, which<br>
you and I pay (or have paid) into-every payday until we retire (which amount is
matched by our employer) --we can expect to get an average $1,000 per month
after retirement. Or, in other words, we would have to collect our average of
$1,000. monthly benefits for 68 years and one (1) month to equal Senator Bill
Bradley's benefits!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Social Security
could be very good if only one small change were made. That change would be to
jerk the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under the Senators and Congressmen.
Put them into the Social Security plan with the rest of us ... then sit back
and watch how fast they would fix it. <br>
If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and
maybe good changes will evolve. <br>
How many people can YOU send this to? <br>
<br>
Sometimes it's hell to be made aware! Bk<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

lingo, there is a visual aid on aircraft carriers to let pilots know if they
are on the proper glide slope for landing on the deck. The item looks like a
&quot;meat ball&quot; and moves up and down depending on how one is doing on
the glide slope. This &quot;meat ball&quot; looking thing is called --
&quot;the ball.&quot; The fact that a pilot has a visual on this approach aid
dictates a radio call to the controller on the ship. The normal call from the
pilot of the Navy S-3 aircraft carrying the President would have been
&quot;Lincoln, Navy One, 12,500 lb., Roger Ball&quot; --meaning, I have the
ball in sight and am on glide path (for a safe landing -- the weight is given
for setting the correct braking tension of the arresting gear cables). <br

visit to our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington that
I (Chaplain Henderson) will never forget. <br>
&quot;The Special Forces soldier had lost his right hand and suffered severe
wounds of his face and side of his body. As SMA Tilley described, how do you
honor such a soldier, showing respect without offending? What can you say or do
in such a situation that will encourage and uplift? How do you shake the right
hand of a soldier who just lost his? Finally he told how he acted as though the
man had a hand, taking his wrist as though it<br>
were his hand and speaking encouragement to him. But he said there was another
man in that group of visitors who had even brought his wife with him to visit
the wounded who knew exactly what to do. This man reverently took this

As the Senate prepares to consider funding for the UN-sponsored Global AIDS initiative
to the tune of $1-billion, a few not-so-surprising facts have emerged. Among
them, the UN Secretariat's office employs 63 staff at an average salary of
&gt;$174,603 (the average American brings in $36,000 annually), while the
average income in the African nations<br>
targeted by the Global Fund is $3,020). Readers will recall President Bush's
promise to fund AIDS prevention in Africa in his most recent SOTU. The
Federalist supports the administration's position for a variety of domestic

The Great Escape? <br>
Texas Democrats can run, but they can't hide from their decline. Thursday, May
22, 2003 12:01 a.m. EDT <br>
When more than 50 Democratic members of the Texas state House fled the state
last week under cover of darkness in order to deprive Republicans of the quorum
they needed to redraw the state's congressional districts, they were called the
&quot;Killer D's&quot; or the &quot;Chicken D's,&quot; depending on one's
partisan leanings. Critics talked about printing up wanted posters or milk
cartons with their pictures, while supporters cheered their success while
fretting that the next time Republicans put their map to a vote, the public
might be less tolerant of freezing all legislative business.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'><br>
Looking at pictures of the &quot;gang that wouldn't vote&quot; made one thing
clear: White Democrats are an endangered species in Texas politics, as indeed
they are throughout the South. Yet while many of the legislators who fled to
Oklahoma were nonwhite, other minority members stayed behind. They have a
different perspective and might have gone along with the GOP gerrymander
because it created more minority districts at the expense of white Democrats.
The plan could not have passed the Texas Senate, where it needed two-thirds
approval, without the votes of Democrats. <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'><br>
Blocking the drawing of new district lines may stave off Democratic decline for
another few years, but it won't revive the party in the South. The only way
Democrats can do that is if they reconnect with white voters on issues while
keeping faith with their minority base. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>White Democrats dominated Texas politics for
decades, creating legendary leaders such as Sam Rayburn, John Connally and
Lyndon Johnson. Only 20 years ago, white Democrats had 21 of the 31 state
Senate seats and 85 of the 150 House seats. Today, only three of the 12 Senate
Democrats and 19 of the 62 House Democrats are white. There are now no white
female Democrats in either house of the Legislature for the first time since<br>
1941. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>Republicans have their own problems. While
they now have overwhelming legislative control in President Bush's home state,
their caucus isn't exactly an exemplar of diversity. Of the 107 Republicans in
the Legislature, one is Hispanic, one Asian and none black. (Black Republicans
have been elected to the Texas Supreme Court and Railroad Commission.) <br

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>Even so, Texas Republicans are now in charge
and dragging white Democrats along in support of their issues. Rep. Chuck
Hopson, a pharmacist from east Texas, admits he often votes for Republican
candidates. &quot;if you look at my district you'll know how I voted,&quot; he
told the Austin American-Statesman. Since every GOP statewide candidate<br>
carried his district, such pragmatism is probably necessary for him to survive.
Mr. Hopson thinks that white Democrats in the Legislature are a vanishing
species. &quot;I think they will go away.&quot;<br style='mso-special-character:

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Republican predators have depleted the herd of white Democrats. In several
states, fewer than one in five whites now votes Democratic. Back in 1995, Rep.
Billy Tauzin (D., La.) observed that &quot;we are the most endangered species
of the political planet, and we know it.&quot; A few months later he became a <br>
Republican. Since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, more than 350 state
legislators have done the same thing. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

identified with minorities and special interests such as trial lawyers--to form
a majority coalition in the South. No non-Southern Democrat has carried a
single Southern state in a presidential race since 1968, when Hubert Humphrey
carried Texas. And although Al Gore is a Southerner, he lost the entire region
in 2000.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

state--but not at the state legislative level. &quot;African-Americans and
Republicans have had something of an unholy alliance at the expense of white Democrats,&quot;
says former GOP state chairman Tom Slade. Together the two groups have bunched
black voters into districts that guarantee the election of minority candidates,
leaving the neighboring districts more white and Republican--a process known as
&quot;bleaching.&quot; Mr. Slade told the Miami Herald that &quot;the creation
of every black Democratic district creates two Republican districts.&quot;<br

the unforeseen consequences of court interpretations of the 1965 Voting Rights
Act is that the Democratic political bench in Florida is made up largely of
state legislators from the party's most loyal voting blocs. Of the 14 Democrats
in the Florida state Senate, all but two are either black or Jewish. Five of
the seven Democrats who represent Florida in the U.S.House are either black or
Jewish. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

of American Politics, says this lopsided picture has consequences for the
Democratic Party's ability to take back Congress. If Sen. Bob Graham vacates
his seat while he runs for president, Democrats &quot;have almost no plausible
statewide candidates,&quot; Mr. Barone says. In 2000, Democratic state chairman
Charles Whitehead even warned that &quot;If Sen. Graham decides to retire, the
Democratic Party in the state of Florida is in a pitiful condition. I don't
think we can get our act together in time to run for a statewide race if he
doesn't stay.&quot; <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

far better competitive position in the South than Republicans were a generation
ago. In 1968, only 6% of voters in Mississippi said they were Republicans.
Today, Democrats hold the governorship in four of the 11 states of the old
Confederacy and control 12 of 22 legislative chambers. But things have not been
going their way. Democrats must stand with minority voters, but they also must
figure out a way to broaden their appeal. Otherwise, the next time Texas
Democrats try to shut down the legislature the outcome may more resemble the
John Wayne movie &quot;The Alamo&quot; more than it does &quot;The Great

This is one thing most Americans hate to do and that is face unpleasant truths.
Our enemies aren't bothered with that problem. They seem to feel if they

The United Nations often claims the moral high ground for its very existence
and for its &quot;peacekeeping&quot; and &quot;humanitarian&quot; efforts
around the globe.&nbsp; In the preamble of its charter, the United Nations
promises to &quot;practice tolerance and live together in peace with one
another as good neighbours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, so much for the moral high ground and the noble promise.&nbsp; On May 4,
2003, the New York Post reported:&nbsp; &quot;A crazed mob of diplomats angry
at being made to wait for lunch because of striking restaurant workers rioted
in U.N. cafeterias Friday and looted them of thousands of dollars in food,
booze and silverware.&quot;<br>

two Gulf carrier deployments under my <br>
belt, I find your criticism of President Bush's visit to the Lincoln <br>
offensive in the extreme! This is the first time that the Commander- in-Chief
took time out of his busy wartime schedule to pay a visit to thank those who
served in the line of fire, in a way that was both dramatic and meaningful to
those on the carrier. Perhaps if LBJ got off his fat ass to do something
similar, our troops' morale in Vietnam might not have been so low. <br

extremely sensitive to styles of leadership. That is, after all, our stock in
trade. And it was not lost on me that the President spent about 30 seconds
shaking hands with the Admiral, CO, and CAG (If you don't know these
abbreviations just look them up in your Funk &amp; Wagnalls!) He then spent the
next 45 minutes putting himself at the disposal of the people who make that
ship work, the yellow shirts, the green shirts, the purple shirts, the chiefs,
the sailors. If you don't know the significance of those colored shirts, look
it up in your Blue Jacket's Manual. Not dressed out in formal uniform (I
understand<br>
at Bush's request), but in their greasy, smelly, sweaty working uniforms....
working a flight deck is hot, hard work. And yet he, in his flight suit, put
himself at their disposal. This was their moment, for 19 or 20 something
year-old kids a few years out of high school, to get a picture of themselves
with the President of the United States, his arm draped around their shoulder.
That is a moment that those kids never dreamed would ever happen to them, maybe
not even when they knew he was coming aboard. Surely, he would see the brass,
not the troops. But it was the <br>
troops to whom he gave his time ... and it was the most natural moment in the
world. You might have thought it was a family reunion, and in a way, it was ...
Bush is one of them, the common man, and while he is still the most powerful
man on the planet right now, he hasn't lost his touch for them. <br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½</span><br>
Was it a political moment? What moment of a president's life is NOT a political
moment? Was it grand-standing, to come in to an OK pass to a 4 wire, a bit high
in close, correcting, left of centerline? Well, hell, he didn't fly the
approach anyway, though I understand from the pilots who flew him that he did a
pretty good job at formation flying, tucked in close for a lead change. You can
always tell a fighter pilot, you just can't tell him very much. And apparently
after 30 years, it all comes back, with a little coaching, I am sure. Frankly,
I would have liked to see him come aboard in an F/A-18, but the Secret Service
vetoed that,<br>
and Bush accepted their judgment ... again, a mark of a good leader. <br

Your help is needed! Some members of the U.S. House are pushing to repeal the
law barring in-state tuition for illegal aliens. That's right, they want to
reward ILLEGAL aliens with tax-subsidized in-state tuition fees that are denied
to LEGAL American citizens. This outrage not only would be a misuse of taxpayer
money, it encourages even more illegal immigrants to cross our borders. <br>
<br>
The law doesn't prohibit illegal immigrants from attending college; it merely
treats them the same as in-state American residents. Schools typically charge
higher tuition rates for out-of-state students. With an estimated 11 million
illegal aliens inside America today, repeal would have a devastating effect on
state budgets, not to mention the effect on the wallets of American parents
forced to pay higher, out-of-state tuition while taxpayers pick up the tab for
illegal students.<br>
<br>
That likely will happen -- unless you act now! Tell your Congressman to block
any attempt to repeal the law governing tuition rates for illegal immigrants.
Then, after signing the petition, email everyone you know to help generate the
needed outcry. Here again is where to act:<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

dollars in direct Foreign Aid annually. The United States is above and beyond
the single most generous benefactor of the United Nations, donating $2.4
billion dollars of YOUR money, to primarily third-world dictators. <br>
---- <br>
This amount is 25% of the United Nations budget. In addition, the United States
also gives another $1.4 billion tax dollars to United Nations' programs and
agencies. The American taxpayers(WE) fund more for the United Nations than ALL
of the other 177<br>
member nations COMBINED. <br>
---- <br>
What most Americans do not realize is that the vast majority of the recipients
of the US Foreign Aid routinely vote against the wishes of the United States in
the United Nations at an average rate of 74%. In other words, of the $13.3
billion&nbsp; tax dollars invested in direct Foreign Aid, only about 26% or
$3.5 billion went to support people who endorsed American initiatives or
causes. A staggering $9.8 billion tax dollars went to causes and people who
were and are in open and direct opposition to the United States' interests and
objectives. <br>
----<br>
---- <br>
Listed below are the actual voting records of various Arabic/Islamic States
which are recorded in both the US State Department and United Nations' records:
<br>
---- <br>
Kuwait votes against the United States 67% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Qatar votes against the United States 67% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Morocco votes against the United States 70% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
United Arab Emirates votes against the U. S. 70% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Jordan votes against the United States 71% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Tunisia votes against the United States 71% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Saudi Arabia votes against the United States 73% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Yemen votes against the United States 74% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Algeria votes against the United States 74% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Oman votes against the United States 74% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Sudan votes against the United States 75% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Pakistan votes against the United States 75% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Libya votes against the United States 76% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Egypt votes against the United States 79% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Lebanon votes against the United States 80% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
India votes against the United States 81% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Syria votes against the United States 84% of the time. <br>
---- <br>
Mauritania votes against the United States 87% of the time. <br>
----<br>
---- <br>
US Foreign Aid to those that hate us: <br>
---- <br>
Egypt, for example, after voting 79% of the time against the United States,
still receives $2 billion annually in US Foreign Aid. <br>
---- <br>
Jordan votes 71% against the United States and receives $192,814,000 annually
in US <br>
Foreign Aid. <br>
---- <br>
Pakistan votes 75% against the United States receives $6,721,000 annually in US
Foreign <br>
Aid. <br>
---- <br>
India votes 81% against the United States receives $143,699,000 annually in US
Foreign <br>
Aid. <br>
==== <br>
Perhaps it is time to get out of the UN and give the tax savings back to the
American workers who are having to skimp and sacrifice to pay the taxes. <br>

take advantage of our policy to live to fight another day. They are one hell of
a threat to our troops. However we Americans are such fair minded people that
our troops are accompanied by lawyers (wonder if any of them got killed
protecting Iraqi rights?) whose duty it is to make sure none of our targets
violate the Geneva Convention. I wonder how many lawyers are with the Iraqi
troops that have killed our captured men? I even wonder what sort of wisdom is
being used when there are already 10,000 Iraqi targets that have been declared
off-limits. No need to think about how so many ambushes take place and why
there were many of us that thought it sheer idiocy to drop food to the enemy
while bombing them. This happening while our Marines weren't getting all the
supplies they needed. It could give pause to many to wonder how did we get to
be such winners in WW2? Bk<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

so far and wide more of an American than most all the sleezeballs out there.

of sycophantic followers they have acquired some courage. However, it's being

Subject: USNS Comfort Visit <br>
To my family, <br>
After reading the letter written by Mrs. Katie Bell, I felt a professional and
morale obligation to personally visit with our Marines and Soldiers on the USNS
Comfort and to get a sense for a part of my profession I have not had contact
with before. As some of you know, in Naval Aviation, accidents normally have
one of two outcomes, death or minor injury. I have never confronted that which
lies between... And after having experienced the &quot;in between&quot; today,
I join Mrs. Bell in knowing that America produces some wonderful human
beings...in spite of what you might hear from the media... <br

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>The USNS Comfort is a 900' Military Sealift
Command vessel manned with 1200 active duty Navy personnel, mostly Medical Corps
and 60 civilian mariners. It has a &quot;Master,&quot; which is the civilian
equivalent of a US Navy Commanding Officer. Military Sealift Command is the
civilian maritime component of the DoD. They actually have quite a few ships
including most of our logistics force i.e. tankers, oilers, ammo, so on and so
forth. They move most of the &quot;heavy&quot; equipment for the Army and
Marines. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

visit. The Comfort is not your normal Navy ship... It is a converted merchant
vessel. It is missing the characteristic watertight hatches, narrow
passageways, steep narrow ladders, overhead cabling, visible plumbing, etc, etc
that you find on a war fighting ship. It actually looks like the inside of any
military hospital except the floors/decks are painted metal plate mostly vice
marble or linoleum. Very roomy and not very nautical. While it didn't have the
interior decor of a Princess Cruise ship, it did have the openness.<span

to see they were not knee deep in casualties at this point. The triage area is
big. This ship can handle upwards of 1000 casualties and this is the biggest
&quot;emergency&quot; room I've ever seen. The hospitals you visit don't come
close to what this place could handle if the situation required it. There is a
great group of patriots working here. They are confronted with the battlefield's
worst and make the initial decision on what action to take. By the way, these
casualties come from all sources; battlefield, field hospital, way station, you
name it, but always by helo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>From
Triage casualties are segregated by injury and sent to different locations,
surgery, x-ray, etc., depending upon need. <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

These have all the necessary life saving equipment/machines the best trauma

can't tell the difference between the males, whether they are EPWs or civilians
caught in the cross fire. I did see several women and was told they were
civilians. Many tubes hanging from stands and tubes going in and out of those

but stable enough to be removed from the primary ICU. This is where I came face
to face with several of our great Soldiers and Marines. This is a slow day in
this room - thankfully, there are only 3 Americans here. Two of the soldiers
were not conscious, one having sustained a head injury and the other
significant shrapnel and bullet wounds. The latter was referred to as the
&quot;miracle&quot; patient. The expectation was death a couple of days ago,
but this brave soul was starting to respond to treatment. The swelling had gone
down enough to enable the surgeons to close his wound and he had had another
surgery today to take care of several holes in his intestines. He was young,
probably in his early twenties. The soldier with the head injury was the pilot
of a helo that had had a hard landing. I would say so - it dropped from about
100 feet... He has been in a coma ever since, but they were pleased to see he
was moving his legs and upper torso although still not conscious. Finally, I
learned about a young Marine. He was conscious and I heard about his chest
wound being closed recently after having the swelling go down enough to allow
the surgeons to close it. He was in his early 20's, a bit older than my oldest,
but then that might have been high since he had probably aged a bit as a result
of his recent combat experience. He was from Texas and proud of it. I was
choked up and could hardly get anything coherent out as I looked at him lying in
his bed with all his bandages and tubing coming from and going into him. He
said he was doing ok and that the staff was treating him well. I thanked him
for all he had done and for &quot;taking one&quot; for the Marine Corps. I said
I represented his aviation support from the Kitty Hawk and we had obviously not
done our job in his case. He said that wasn't the case and it was ok. That did
it for me; I couldn't speak anymore... He raised his hand to shake mine and we
did so. I couldn't have been more proud of him and all those he represented
lying there in that bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span><o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

this one was filled with Iraqis. The make up of this ward included male and
female.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Actually there were two married
couples here. Each having sustained injuries at the same time. I heard one
cryptic story of the Fidayeen grabbing one couple and using them as shields in

Iraqi civilians were recovering with less severe injuries. They were a mix of
male and female ranging in age from 3 years to 60s. The 3 year old was there as
a result of a women passing this child to a Marine in an evac helo. The Marine
accepted the child who had been burnt pretty badly in the lower torso and not
knowing anything about the child. The little girl was taken care of as were all
the casualties that came to Comfort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½
</span>Unfortunately, she was a Jane Doe. No one knew a thing about her. So the
staff took pictures and had passed them out to everyone that would take them
ashore in an attempt to find her parents. Amazingly enough a 12 year old girl
arrived two weeks later with an injury and identified the 3 year old as her
little cousin. The 3 year old's parents had been killed and her aunt was the
one that gave her to the Marines realizing she would die if left in Iraq. Both
girls are recovering nicely. There was also a little, but very active 6/7 year
old girl in the ward. She had no injuries, but her story is also amazing. It
seems she was lying in a &quot;field&quot; in Kuwait when the operation began.
The Soldiers picked her up and sent her to the Comfort. She &quot;came to&quot;
enroute and started acting like any 6/7 year old. She was examined and found to
be fit. <br>
Unfortunately, no one knows who she is or where she came from other than that
spot in the desert... She has become the ward's entertainment/mascot so to
speak. She is full of life, having &quot;high fived&quot; all of us during our
visit. She is pretty cute and several of the<br>
Navy personnel are talking adoption if they can't find her family or home. <br

These guys are mostly Iraqi Army, the most basic and ill equipped of Saddam's
ex army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>They range from late
teens/early twenties to 60 plus. A variety of injuries and wounds, but all
recovering. Interestingly there are only 4 interpreters onboard... One story I
was told was about one of these guys waking up after surgery and asking if he
was in heaven...The staff chuckled. And I was thinking the answer should have
been &quot;Well, yes and no&quot;... Another EPW was headed into surgery and he
thought he was going to be killed, having never seen an operating room full of
masked people speaking English while trying to keep him alive...How ironic...

a much better appreciation for the sacrifices made by others. We are indeed a
blessed country that we would have such fine young people willing to put
themselves in harms way knowing full well they could end up on USNS Comfort or

Picayune have an aversion for really looking at problems that seem to plague
our fair city and the black community? Already the bleeding heart liberals and
anti gun nuts are blaming the guns and not the miscreants that pulled the
triggers! It would seem that the school shooting in New Orleans, despite
penitentiary-like security measures and metal detectors at John McDonogh High
School, a 15-year-old was killed and three others injured by another student
who smuggled in an AK-47 assault rifle. All the typical Left media calls for
gun control notwithstanding (as previously mentioned, none of those measures
prevented this assault), isn't it interesting that this school was named for a
wealthy merchant and financier, John McDonogh, who, at his death in 1850, split
his $1.5-million estate between New Orleans and Baltimore for the promotion of
education. New Orleans spent its share to launch its government school system,
while Baltimore spent its share to create a disciplined military orphanage for
the betterment of young men with a sharp contrast to the McDonogh School in New
Orleans today. It's the endowed private McDonogh School in Baltimore that has
no metal detectors at its doors and boys and girls graduating from its
curriculum number among Maryland's most esteemed leaders in business, medicine,
law and public service. New Orleans could it be the lack of personal
responsibility and family support, that is the main culprit for the social
climate and school deterioration? ... PS&gt;With very little doubt that this

style='color:navy'>Military History in a Nutshell, The Complete Military
History of France<br>
!<br>
Gallic Wars - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2000 years of
French history, France is conquered by of all things, an Italian.<br>
- Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic called
Joan who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare; <br>
&quot;France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman.&quot;
Sainted.<br>
-Italian Wars - Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever lose
two wars when fighting Italians.<br>
- Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots<br>
- Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages to
get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the other
participants started ignoring her.<br>
- War of Revolution - Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as
chapeaux.<br>
-The Dutch War ï¿½ Tied <br>
-War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - Lost,
but claimed as a tie. Three ties in a row induces deluded Frogophiles the world
over to label the period as the height of French military power.<br>
-War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The War also gave the French their first
taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved ever since. <br>
- American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to future
Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists saw far more
action. This is later known as &quot;de Gaulle Syndrome&quot;, and leads to the
Second Rule of French Warfare; &quot;France only wins when America does most of
the fighting.&quot;<br>
- French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also
French.<br>
- The Napoleonic Wars - Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First Rule!)
due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British
footwear designer.<br>
- The Franco-Prussian War - Lost. Germany first plays the role of drunk Frat
boy to France's ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night. <br>
- World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United
States. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not only sleep
with a winner, but one who doesn't call her &quot;Fraulein.&quot;<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American
forces forestalls any improvement in the French bloodline.<br>
-World War II - Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and
Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song.<br>
- War in Indochina - Lost. French forces plead sickness, take to bed with the
Dien Bien Flu <br>
- Algerian Rebellion - Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army by a
Non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First Rule of
Muslim Warfare; &quot;We can always beat the French.&quot; This rule is
identical to the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English,
Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux.<br>
- War on Terrorism - France, keeping in mind its recent history, surrenders to
Germans and Muslims just to be safe. Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese
ambassador fail after he takes refuge in a McDonald's.<span

in Iraq with as much of a civilized approach as possible, I feel it is now time
to place our highest value on (1) the lives of our own military people, who are
bravely facing terrorism and treachery, and (2) winning. Forget trying to win a
political war. The Arab world already hates us, as do elements in our own
country that should leave and shop for a &quot;better&quot; life elsewhere. We
just need to remind them that acting on that irrational hatred, as was done on
9-11, will lead to inevitable destruction for them. Those Arabs who care to
clean up, and take out the garbage of hatred from their regimes, should be
rewarded. Those who continue to foment hatred and make war against us must be
destroyed. The U.S. didn't start this conflict, but we must finish it. Give
Saddam (best pronounced &quot;Sodom&quot;) the massive, crushing, immediate
defeat he so deserves. This will send a message to the Arab League that their
fears are correct: If they will not eliminate the propagation of hatred and the
exporting of terrorism from their countries, they too will be in line for a
regime change. Duh! That's the point of all this. Massive, brute, victorious
force is all these people understand. Let's pull out all the stops and free
Baghdad. Let's give the savage element in Arab lands some real food for thought
about their own behavior and attitudes, and where those things can lead for
them. If they cannot control their own behavior, we will do it for them. Find
fault with this if you will. The Kahuna never forgets, that his grandson the

right in the middle of the Iraqi war.&nbsp; I thought you might find his letter
enlightening, as well as the response from Randy DeLay, Congressman Tom DeLay's
brother.<br>
<br>
I am meeting with the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee of U.S. House of

Marine)&nbsp;this afternoon. I am going to deliver this message to him
personally. God Bless<br>

All's well, not nearly the bleak picture CNN would have you believe.&nbsp;
Concerned about anxiety back home, I penned the following note for our MAG-29
website.&nbsp; It pretty much sums up how I feel.&nbsp; Feel free to pass it
on.&nbsp; s// Boomer<br>
<br>
March 25, 2003 Dear family and friends, <br>
<br>
Do not worry needlessly, believe me, all is well. I know everyone depends on
television to stay abreast of events, but you must take what they tell you with
some reservation. Remember, they must create drama, for it is the drama that
keeps you watching. Things are not nearly as bleak as they would lead you to
believe. The outcome of our undertaking is not in doubt, nor has it ever been.
Yes, we have taken some licks, but we are dishing it out much more than we are
taking, and the ratio continues to widen. Do not be discouraged by the
protests, we are not.. It is a cherished American freedom. They only validate
what we are doing. The Iraqi people do not share this same freedom to openly
disagree with their government - this will change. Do not be discouraged by
what many interpret to be a cautious advance. Nobody works harder in battle to
reduce the risks for unnecessary damage or the loss of innocent life than we
do; the value we put on human life is the reason we are here. !<br>
&nbsp;Our success will not be measured by bloodshed, but by the manner we
liberate the Iraqi people. We will always maintain the moral high ground. Their
treatment of our POWs, their use of women and children as shields, and their
false surrenders are all signs of frustration. This war was not started in
Washington, but in Baghdad. Most will sit on the sidelines as history is
written, few will actually participate. Your sons and daughters, husbands and
wives, are all participating in a historical undertaking. It is a cause with
honor, and one they will look back upon with pride. I will tell you again, I
have never served with a finer group of men and women in my 28 years of
service. Do not doubt us, do not doubt our determination, do not doubt our
cause, and never doubt the outcome! God bless you. <br>
<br>
Semper Fidelis, <br>

that, they all harbor such envy and<br>
jealously toward us and all we stand for. Especially Kofi Annan, that paragon
of double speak.. Every time he opens his mouth it's only to find fault with
us. I for one find it extremely difficult to fathom that he, or that cabal of
hate the USA crowd, seems never to find fault or anything wrong with the
actions of Iraqï¿½s Saddam Hussein or his evil regime. Kofi had no problem
finding fault with the few people who got hurt via one bombing mistake in Iraq.
The bomb that was blamed on us, when all the time it was one of their mistakes?
Saddam is the killer here - not our troops who are there to liberate the Iraqi
people. I don't feel as if we (America) have any true friends, even those
helping us now. In my view they do so with a question of expediency in mind and
what will be in it for them down the road! Hells fire Uncle Sugar is always
good for a few million, if the cards are played right. Can I be forgiven for
being such a cynic? Never lose sight of the fact that America has rarely, if
ever, asked for help from other countries that have benefited so often from our
largess. Surely you have noticed the number who choose to decline to give that
help. They don't even bother to pay us lip service. Just pay attention to the
results at the UN. When this is all behind us, I sincerely hope and pray that
we (our<br>
government) will wise up! Those in Washington might even set a very nasty
precedent and think of our country and it's taxpayers first. It could happen?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

I'm asking you TODAY, please take a moment and pray for this man.&nbsp; <br>
He is in a situation that few people find themselves in.&nbsp; <br>
He is criticized by many people at every turn, and few people have taken the
time to thank him for the things that he has done for them.&nbsp; <br>
A lot of people know this man, but few people know the extent of his
situation.&nbsp; <br>
We're quick to criticize when we've never walked in their shoes, and we're slow
to pray that God will show them which way to go.&nbsp; <br>
So I'm asking you to stop at some time TODAY, and pray for this man.&nbsp; <br>
He needs our urgent prayers that God can give him the guidance he needs to get
through this situation.&nbsp; <br>
This man hasn't asked me to do this, but I feel led to do so and I'm sure that
he appreciates all your prayers. <br>

need to send these thoughts to you....<br>
Looking and listening to the news of our war with Iraq, I come away with many
thoughts. The thought that is uppermost in my mind is &quot;this is truly a
time to test the souls of we Americans&quot;. Listening to our politicians
speak about the rules of war and how they will be adhered to by our fighting
men and women - this is a noble gesture indeed, however it would be more
impressive if both sides engaged in his conflict, were to be following said
rules. The news today says that the enemy (Iraq) is executing American and British
prisoners. In the next breath we are told that we are doing everything in our
power to get aid to the Iraqi people. Forgive me but shouldn't our first
concern be the well being of our troops? Shouldn't the enemy be way down on our
list of priorities? IMHO the statement made after we took the only major port
that the enemy has, one of our great thinkers said &quot; now we will be able
to get the supplies in for the Iraqi people much faster&quot; this when we<br>
(ME) are told by someone at the front (no name can be used) that our people
(troops) don't at the moment have everything they need. Is this evolving into
another political war run by politicians who can't find their derriï¿½res with
both hands. I shudder to think that my grandson and his buddies are at the
mercy of a Ted Kennedy type (he couldn't even have the courage to jump in and
save Mary Jo!) God forbid this turns out to be another Korea or NAM experience.
The country and our fighting men deserve only one thing; a united, we are
behind you, one hundred percent America. Not politicos paying lip service to
those around the world, who in the final analysis would relish seeing the
United States fall on our ass! When we choose to get into this (no matter what
our reasons) we must be in this to win. Second place, unlike the game of hand
grenades and horseshoes, close to winning doesn't count!! <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

now decided is to take the advice of all the opposing nations and stop
interfering in other countries' affairs. So as not to be accused of
imperialism, we will, effective immediately: 1) Withdraw ALL our
military&nbsp;peacekeeping troops from around the globe, so that we may more
effectively protect our own people and borders. To put this into effect ASAP,
we must regretfully --- 2) Stop ALL financial foreign aid. You know--
heartless, capitalistic, self-serving things like sending nutritional and
medical aid, supplies, personnel, and other forms of assistance whenever
natural disasters strike (earthquakes, drought, famine, decease). No nation
even comes close to the charity we bestow on others. Yes, I'm fully aware that
the U.S. is guilty of waste &amp; polluting, but no other nation shares their
wealth and puts forth the amount of time, money, research, and effort in trying
to resolve (and solve) these problems, worldwide.&nbsp; 3) We will use the
money beforehand given as foreign aid to develop alternate energy sources, so
at long last we can tell the Middle East where they can stick their oil. <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

&quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;ignorant&quot;, &quot;moronic&quot; leaders, and then
at the celebrities who are castigating them:<br>
<br>
President George W. Bush: Received a Bachelors Degree from Yale University and
an MBA from Harvard Business School. He served as an F-102 pilot for the Texas
Air National Guard. He began his career in the oil and gas business in Midland
in 1975 and worked in the energy industry until 1986. He was elected Governor
on November 8, 1994, with 53.5 percent of the vote. In a historic re-election
victory, he became the first Texas Governor to be elected to consecutive<br>
four-year terms on November 3, 1998 winning 68.6 percent of the vote.<br

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Hispanic vote, 27 percent of the African-American vote, 27 percent of Democrats
and 65 percent of women. He won more Texas counties, 240 of 254, than any
modern Republican other than Richard Nixon in 1972 and is the first Republican
gubernatorial candidate to win the heavily Hispanic and Democratic border
counties of El Paso, Cameron and Hidalgo. (Someone began circulating a false
story about his I.Q. being lower than any other President. If you believed it,
you might want to go to URBANLEGENDS.COM and see the truth.)<br

1965 and a M.A. in 1966, both in political science. Two years later, he won an
American Political Science Association congressional fellowship. One of Vice
President Cheney's primary duties is to share with individuals, members of
Congress and foreign leaders, President Bush's vision to strengthen our
economy, secure our homeland and win the War on Terrorism. In his official role
as President of the Senate, Vice<br>
President Cheney regularly goes to Capital Hill to meet with Senators and
members of the House of Representatives to work on the Administration's
legislative goals. In his travels as Vice President, he has seen first hand the
great demands the war on terrorism is placing on the men and women of our
military, and he is<br>
proud of the tremendous job they are doing for the United States of America.<br

the United States of America. The silence was deafening from the Left when Bill
Clinton bombed a pharmaceutical factory outside of Khartoum, or when he
attacked the Bosnian Serbs in 1995 and 1999. He bombed Serbia itself to get
Slobodan Milosevic out of Kosovo, and not a single peace rally was held. When
our Rangers were ambushed in Somalia and 18 young American lives were lost, not
a peep was heard from Hollywood. Yet now, after our nation has been attacked on
its own soil, after 3,000 Americans were killed, by freedom-hating terrorists,

According to the CIA World Factbook, France controls over 22.5 percent of
Iraqï¿½s imports.[1] French total trade with Iraq under the oil-for-food program
is the third largest, totaling $3.1 billion since 1996, according to the United
Nations.[2] In 2001 France became Iraqï¿½s largest European trading partner.<br>
Roughly 60 French companies do an estimated $1.5 billion in trade with Baghdad
annually under the U.N. oil-for-food program.[3] Franceï¿½s largest oil company,
Total Fina Elf, has negotiated a deal to develop the Majnoon field in western
Iraq. The Majnoon field purportedly contains up to 30 billion barrels of
oil.[4] Total Fina Elf also negotiated a deal for future oil exploration in
Iraqï¿½s Nahr Umar field. Both the Majnoon and Nahr Umar fields are estimated to
contain as much as 25 percent of the countryï¿½s reserves.[5] Franceï¿½s Alcatel
company, a major telecom firm, is negotiating a $76 million contract to
rehabilitate Iraqï¿½s telephone system.[6] From 1981 to 2001, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), France was
responsible for over 13 percent of Iraqï¿½s arms imports.[7] Germany Direct trade
between Germany and Iraq amounts to about $350 million annually, and another $1
billion is reportedly sold through third parties.[8] It has recently been
reported that Saddam Hussein has ordered Iraqi domestic businesses to show
preference to German companies as a reward for Germanyï¿½s firm positive stand in
rejecting the launching of a military attack against Iraq. It was also reported
that over 101 German companies were present at the Baghdad Annual
exposition.[9] During the 35th Annual Baghdad International Fair in November
2002, a German company signed a contract for $80 million for 5,000 cars and
spare parts.[10] In 2002, DaimlerChrysler was awarded over $13 million in
contracts for German trucks and spare parts.[11] German officials are
investigating a German corporation accused of illegally channeling weapons to
Iraq via Jordan. The equipment in question is used for boring the barrels of
large cannons and is allegedly intended for Saddam Husseinï¿½s Al Fao Supercannon
project.[12] Russia According to the CIA World Factbook, Russia controls
roughly 5.8 percent of Iraqï¿½s annual imports.[13] Under the U.N. oil-for-food
program, Russiaï¿½s total trade with Iraq was somewhere between $530 million and
$1 billion for the six months ending in December of 2001.[14] According to the
Russian Ambassador to Iraq, Vladimir Titorenko, new contracts worth another
$200 million under the U.N. oil-for-food program are to be signed over the next
three months.[15] Soviet-era debt of $7 billion through $8 billion was
generated by arms sales to Iraq during the 1980&amp;ndash;1988 Iran Iraq war.<br>
Russiaï¿½s LUKoil negotiated a $4 billion, 23-year contract in 1997 to
rehabilitate the 15 billion-barrel West Qurna field in southern Iraq. Work on
the oil field was expected to commence upon cancellation of U.N. sanctions on
Iraq. The deal is currently on hold.[16] In October 2001, Salvneft, a Russian
Belarus company, negotiated a $52 million service contract to drill at the Tuba
field in Southern Iraq.[17] In April 2001, Russiaï¿½s Zaruezhneft company
received a service contract to drill in the Saddam, Kirkuk, and Bai Hassan
fields to rehabilitate the fields and reduce water incursion. A future $40
billion Iraqi-Russian economic agreement, reportedly signed in 2002, would
allow for extensive oil exploration opportunities throughout western Iraq.[18]
The proposal calls for 67 new projects, over a 10-year time frame, to explore
and further develop fields in southern Iraq and the Western Desert, including
the Suba, Luhais, West Qurna, and Rumaila projects. Additional projects added
to the deal include second-phase construction of a pipeline running from
southern to northern Iraq, and extensive drilling and gas projects. Work on
these projects would commence upon cancellation of sanctions.[19] Russiaï¿½s
Gazprom company over the past few years has signed contracts worth $18 million
to repair gas stations in Iraq.[20] The former Soviet Union was the premier
supplier of Iraqi arms. From 1981 to 2001, Russia supplied Iraq with 50 percent
of its arms.[21] China According to the CIA World Factbook, China controls
roughly 5.8 percent of Iraqï¿½s annual imports.[22] China National Oil Company,
partnered with China North Industries Corp., negotiated a 22-year-long deal for
future oil exploration in the Al Ahdab field in southern Iraq.[23] In recent
years, the Chinese Aero-Technology Import-Export Company (CATIC) has been
contracted to sell meteorological satellite and surface observation equipment
to Iraq. This contract was approved by the U.N. oil-for-food program.[24] CATIC
also won approval from the U.N. in July 2000 to sell $2 million worth of fiber
optic cables. This and similar contracts approved were disguised as
telecommunications gear. These cables can be used for secure data and
communications links between national command and control centers and
long-range search radar, targeting radar, and missile-launch units, according
to U.S. officials. In addition, China National Electric Wire &amp; Cable and
China National Technical Import Telecommunications Equipment Company are
believed to have sold Iraq $6 million and $15.5 million worth of communications
equipment and other unspecified supplies, respectively.[25] According to a
report from SIPRI, from 1981 to 2001, China was the<br>
second largest supplier of weapons and arms to Iraq, supplying over 18 percent
of Iraqï¿½s weapons imports.[26]<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

They are our greatest foe. Also I'm told there are over seven (7) million

the USA in Europe. Their perception of us is we are too loud, too rich, too
full of themselves and to quote the people of Britain during WW2 &quot;over
here&quot; and &quot;God&quot; forbid, so much happier than those Europeans.
This feeling, and it makes me nauseous, has reached such large proportions.
This seems incredible and difficult for me to fathom. What does it take for
America to prove (and why must we) that we have been the greatest ally and
friend the worlds down-trodden and abused have ever had. A little over half a
century ago, more than half a million young Americans died for our freedoms and
the worldï¿½s! Have we forgotten so soon? Has the world also forgotten so soon
the ordinary men, women and children from dozens of countries, not just
Americans? These innocents were butchered by a small group of religious
fanatics. Are we so devoid of memory that we have also forgotten them already?
Why do we now have the Hollywood cretins joining with the&nbsp; anti-American
alliance made up of easy to loath liberals, who blame the Americans for every
ill in world. IF WE ARE THE WORLDS GREATEST SUPER POWER, AND I BELIEVE WE ARE,
are there any who care to be honest differ with the fact that America has
behaved with enormous restraint since September 11?<span style="mso-spacerun:

disturbed to see there are people in this country, at this particular time, who

recent comments praising Osama bin Laden. They were offensive, hurtful and
wrong. Worst of all, they do not appear to be isolated remarks.<br>
<br>
I agree with Rep. Nethercutt, that to have a senator suggest that Osama bin
Laden is a good guy and the U.S. hasn't done anything to help people is
shocking, bizarre and uninformed; I have to wonder what country you've been
living in since September 11th. Osama bin Laden didn't build roads, schools and
day cares. He ran terrorist camps in Afghanistan that trained the killers who
carried out the 9/11 attacks on America. It's the American people who lead the
world in helping people of impoverished countries, not murderers like bin
Laden.<br>
<br>
You sent the message to those students that the United States somehow deserved
or brought on the September 11 terrorist attacks. It is absolutely outrageous
and despicable to imply that the American government should learn a lesson from
the madman who murdered thousands of American citizens. With all due respect,
(?) these statements prove that all cretins aren't in hiding!! The only one who
should learn a lesson here is YOU. If you have any honor or respect for those
Americans who lost their lives on 9/11, you should resign from the U.S. Senate

America<br>
<br>
Just days ago I alerted you to the Center for Reclaiming America's new effort
to expose the ACLU's radical agenda. I need your help. As I write, the ACLU is
leading the charge on dozens of cases that undermine YOUR religious liberties
and YOUR family.<br>
<br>
Allow me to point out just three examples of the ACLU's attacks:<br>
<br>
ACLU ATTACK #1<br>
<br>
As unbelievable as it sounds, the ACLU is leading the effort to ensure that
YOUR CHILDREN can view Internet pornography in your local public library!<br>
<br>
It is totally outrageous. The ACLU is right now fighting a U.S. Supreme Court
case to have the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) ruled
unconstitutional, because it restricts funds to libraries that do not block
pornography.<br>
<br>
The ACLU wants to ensure your children's RIGHT to view pornography in your
public library!<br>
<br>
THE PETITION EXPOSING THE ACLU'S AGENDA:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cfra.info/33/petition.asp?RID=2792909"><span
style='color:navy'>http://www.cfra.info/33/petition.asp?RID=2792909</span></a><br>
<br>
ACLU ATTACK #2<br>
<br>
The ACLU also attacks pro-family and pro-America values in the court of public
opinion. Right now, the ACLU is engaged in a massive campaign opposing Attorney
General John Ashcroft's work to protect our nation from terrorist attacks.<br>
<br>
The ACLU is running full-page ads in The New York Times as part of a $3.5 million
initiative. This is just the latest charge the ACLU has leveled against the
Attorney General, who has proven to be one of the strongest defenders of family
values ever to serve in that position.<br>
<br>
THE PETITION EXPOSING THE ACLU'S AGENDA:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.cfra.info/33/petition.asp?RID=2792909"><span
style='color:navy'>http://www.cfra.info/33/petition.asp?RID=2792909</span></a><br>
<br>
<br>
ACLU ATTACK #3<br>
<br>
The ACLU is directly targeting the nature of the family, even to the point of
forcing people of faith to accept and support homosexual and lesbian
lifestyles.<br>
<br>
For example, the ACLU took the lead in a case in Kentucky in which a Christian
medical doctor was contesting a law that forced him to hire homosexual and
lesbian workers -- even though this violated his personal religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
The ACLU won -- and now a federal court has officially placed the
&quot;rights&quot; of homosexuals and lesbians ABOVE your religious
liberties.&nbsp; All thanks to the ACLU!<br>
<br>
This may be one of the most important initiatives we have ever undertaken.<br>
<br>
Please respond today so I can include you among the &quot;Charter&quot; signers
of this petition.<br>
<br>
Remember, I want to rally 100,000 citizens by March 31 for a major delivery to
leaders and the media.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>
<br>
D. James Kennedy, Ph.D.<br>

<br>
P.S. Once you sign, I need your help to rally as many citizens across the
country as possible. But first, be sure to sign the petition and help me expose
the ACLU's agenda!<br>
<br>
P.P.S. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on the ACLU's case to keep our libraries
open to Internet pornography next month.<br>
Please help me rally citizens to take a stand.<br>

PRACTICE can be a fairly good show, but last night's program was so typical of
your agenda. You picked the 'dufus' of the office tobe the one who was against
the idea of his mother being gay and made him look like a whiner because he had
convictions. This type of mentality calls people like me a &quot;gay
basher.&quot; Read the first chapter of Romans (that's in the Bible) and see
what the apostle Paul had to say about it.... He, God and Jesus were all 'gay
bashers'. What if she'd fallen in love with her cocker spaniel? Is that an
alternative lifestyle? (By the way, the Bible speaks against that, too.) <br>

invaders, or homeowners?<br>
<br>
According to the New York Times, Mr. Ronald Dixon of Brooklyn, NY, &quot;was
upstairs, in bed, when he heard a noise in the hallway. Half asleep, he opened
his eyes and saw a man at the top of the stairs heading toward the bedroom of
Mr. Dixon's 2-year-old son, Kyle. That was enough for the father. He grabbed a
9-millimeter pistol that he kept in a closet, walked toward the man and asked
what he was doing there. This man, Mr. Dixon said, ran at him, screaming.
That's when he pulled the trigger. He shot the intruder twice, wounding him
seriously but not mortally.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, 27-year-old Mr. Dixon is your basic &quot;straight arrow,&quot; a Navy
veteran who works two jobs -- 80 hours a week -- as a computer specialist to
provide for his family, including two small children. The man accused of being
the intruder, Ivan Thompson, 40, is a career criminal with a long record of
burglaries and other crimes. If convicted this time, he could be locked away
for a long, long time.<br>
<br>
Case closed, right? Not quite.<br>
<br>
Mr. Dixon had purchased his gun legally when he lived in Florida. He had just
recently moved to Brooklyn, and was smack dab in the middle of running through
all the hoops and jumping through all the rings -- and there are a LOT of them
-- to get his gun registered in New York.<br>
<br>
But the registration process wasn't yet complete when he used his gun to defend
his family. And Mr. Dixon lives in a borough whose district attorney, Charles
J. Hynes, &quot;considers the prosecution of illegal-gun charges a supreme
virtue. Mr. Hynes wants Mr. Dixon to do jail time... If convicted of the
misdemeanor charge against him, Mr. Dixon could get as much as a year. Mr.
Hynes is offering a plea bargain that would involve four weekends, tops, on
Rikers Island.&quot;<br>
<br>
You read that right. Mr. Dixon is facing up to a year on RIKERS ISLAND if he
doesn't accept the &quot;plea bargain&quot; from District Attorney Hynes and
plead GUILTY on a gun possession charge, for a gun he had purchased legally and
was in the process of making legal in New York. And if he's found guilty, his
permanent record could keep him from obtaining work in his field.<br>
<br>
We just don't think that's right.<br>
<br>
ACTION ITEM:&nbsp; The Brooklyn DA is elected to that position, from what we
understand. As an elected official, he is obligated to listen to what voters
have to say. So, we've set up a way for you to easily communicate with him.<br>
<br>
Go to the site below to send an editable pre-written message to DA Charles J.
Hynes, letting him know what you think of prosecuting upstanding law-abiding
citizens who try to protect their families:<br>

<br>
General &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing was born September 13th, 1860 near
Laclede,&nbsp;MS. he died July 15th, 1948 in Washington, D.C.<br>
<br>
Highlights of his life include:<br>
<br>
1891 Professor of Military Science and Tactics University of Nebraska<br>
1898 Serves in the Spanish-American War<br>
1901 Awarded rank of Captain<br>
1906 Promoted to rank of Brigadier General<br>
1909 Military Governor of Moro Province, Philippines<br>
1916 Made Major General<br>
1919 Promoted to General of the Armies<br>
1921 Appointed Chief of Staff<br>
1924 Retires from active duty Education West Point.<br>
<br>
Just before World War I, there were a number of terrorist attacks on the United
States forces in the Philippines by Muslim extremists. So General Pershing
captured 50 terrorists and had them tied to posts for execution. He then had
his men bring in two pigs and slaughter them in front of the, now horrified,
terrorists.<br>
<br>
Muslims detest pork because they believe pigs are filthy animals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Some of them simply refuse to eat it, while
others won't even touch pigs at all, nor any of their by-products. To them,
eating or touching a pig, its meat, its blood, etc., is to be instantly barred
from paradise (and those virgins) and doomed to hell.<br>
<br>
The soldiers then soaked their bullets in the pigs blood, and proceeded to
execute 49 of the terrorists by firing squad. The soldiers then dug a big hole,
dumped in the terrorist's bodies and covered them in pig blood, entrails, etc.<br>
<br>
They let the 50th man go.&nbsp; And for the next forty-two years, there
was&nbsp;not a single Muslim extremist attack anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
Maybe it is time for this segment of history to repeat itself, maybe in Iraq?
The question is, where do we find another Black Jack Pershing?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

wrenching anti-Americanism and lack of support for U.S. policy, and the
decision being made by our President is this. We could and should take the
billions we are spending to prepare for war and the blackmail money given to
pay off Turkey and others and use it instead to rid ourselves of dependency on
Middle East oil. The tree huggers in our society may have a hissy fit, but we
could then use the money to develop oil and gas reserves in the United States,
Mexico and South America and searching for alternate energy sources. We could
spend it on missile defense and homeland security. The troops that<br>
we have all over the world, including those building roads in places like Haiti
and protection of Europe (there over fifty years). We should bring out troops
home and let the Middle East and Europe fend for themselves, they have been on
the American teat long enough. Perhaps then a greater appreciation for what the
United States has done for all these places and the world would be would be
realized. It would be very interesting to see how they manage without the
meddling, pushy Americans. Could they do it? Let the America bashers

Belying claims that Prime Minister Tony Blair is in trouble, Britain's House of
Commons yesterday gave his Iraq policy a strong vote of support.
&quot;Lawmakers by a vote of 434-124 approved a government-sponsored motion
which backed the prime minister's efforts to resolve the crisis through the
United Nations and called on Iraq 'to recognize this as its final opportunity'
to disarm,&quot; the Associated Press reports from London.<br>
Another motion, stating that &quot;the case for military action against Iraq
[is] as yet unproven,&quot; was voted down, 393-199.<br>
Blair won these votes with the support of 77.8% and 66.4% of parliamentarians,
respectively. That's a pretty convincing margin, but look how the left-wing
media spin the story:<br>

Dodge Drafter will begin production in Canada this year. They had to pull that

When Clinton was asked what he thought about foreign affairs, he replied:

A petition in support of the sovereignty and defense of the United States<br>
<br>
You have, undoubtedly, heard about the well-funded &quot;anti-war&quot;
petition &quot;Not In Our Name&quot; and the ad campaign &quot;Win Without
War&quot; paid for by a coterie of celebrity and academic Leftists and their
front organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>They are
objecting, ostensibly, to the U.S. campaign against terrorism following the
unprecedented attack on our countrymen September 11, 2001.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>This cadre of self-styled geopolitical
mavens (Gloria Steinem, &quot;Hanoi Jane&quot; Fonda, Jesse Jackson, Martin
Sheen, Susan Sarandon, Ed Asner, Rabbi Michael Lerner, et al.) is using the
current threat from Iraq to do what they do best -- evoke anti-American
sentiment and incite anti-American action across our great nation.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the publicity of these celebrity campaigns in the Washington Post and
New York Times have spawned anti-American and anti-military protests across the
nation.<br>
<br>
In rebuttal to these Leftists, Patriot Petitions has launched a
counter-offensive petition -- &quot;In Our Name: A Statement of Justice&quot;
-- calling on all Americans to stand up for the sovereignty of our nation, as
well as the right -- and obligation -- of these United States to take the war
on terrorism to the shores of terrorist aggressors and their state
sponsors.&nbsp; If we don't fight them on their soil, we will surely be fighting
them on our soil.&nbsp; While military intervention is certainly not desirable
and may not be inevitable on all of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; terrorist
fronts, if war is all that stands between terrorists and our families, so be
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>It is just and necessary to call to
account every entity that poses a clear and present danger to the security of
the United States and our heritage of liberty, our countrymen and our
posterity.<br>

national sovereignty by supporting our Commander-in-Chief and military forces

by George Carlin <br>
I Am Your Worst Nightmare. I am a BAD American. I am George Carlin. I believe
the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some mid level governmental
functionary be it Democratic or Republican! I'm in touch with my feelings and I
like it that way, damn it! <br>
I think owning a gun doesn't make you a killer, it makes you a smart American. <br>
I think being a minority does not make you noble or victimized, and does not
entitle you to anything, you don't work for! <br>
I believe that if you are selling me a Big Mac, try to do it in English. And if
you are a citizen of the United States start speaking the language. <br>
I think fireworks should be legal on the 4th of July. <br>
I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than
working at Blockbuster. In fact, if your parents are footing the bill to put
your pansy ass through 4 years plus, of college, you haven't begun to be
enlightened. <br>
I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God when and where they
want to. <br>
My heroes are John Wayne, Babe Ruth, Roy Rogers, and whoever canceled Jerry
Springer. <br>
I don't hate the rich. I don't pity the poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½
</span><br>
I know wrestling is fake and I don't waste my time arguing about it. <br>
I think global warming is a big lie. Where are all those experts now, when I'm
freezing my ass off during these long winters and paying, paying, paying? <br>
I've never owned a slave, or was a slave, I didn't wander forty years In the
desert after getting chased out of Egypt. I haven't burned any witches or been
persecuted by the Turks and neither have you! So, shut-the-Hell-up already. <br>
I want to know which church is it exactly where the Reverend Jesse Jackson
practices, which branch of the Government he gets his money, and why he is
always part of the problem and not the solution. <br>
Can I get an AMEN on that one? <br>
<br>
I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you're running
from them. I also think they have the right to pull your ass over if you're
breaking the law, regardless of what color you are. <br>
I think if you are too stupid to know how a ballot works, I don't want you
deciding who should be running the most powerful nation in the world for the
next four years. <br>
I dislike those people standing in the intersections trying to sell me crap or
trying to guilt me into making &quot;donations&quot; to their cause.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>These people should be targets. <br>
I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes two
parents, a married man and woman. <br>
I believe if she has her lips on your Willie, it's sex, and this applies even
if you are President of the United States. <br>
And what the hell is going on with gas prices... again? <br>
If this makes me a BAD American, then yes, I'm a BAD American. If you are a BAD
American too, please forward this to everyone you know. We need our country
back! <br>
God only grants us a short time on this earth. Let us treat each other well,
and with all the love we would wish for ourselves. <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

this question, and one of them gave what I considered to be a very good answer.
He stated: &quot;If it were only the war we lost, it wouldn't be that big a
deal. But the North didn't only win the war, it sought to destroy our culture
afterwards and that is what we can't forget.&quot; Having read some of the
history of what was euphemistically termed &quot;reconstruction&quot; that took
place after the war was over, I can hardly disagree with my friend's sentiment.
The North did, indeed, brazenly attempt to destroy the culture of the Old
South. That they didn't quite succeed wasn't their fault, for they surely gave
it the old college try. <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>Historian Otto Scott, in his newsletter
&quot;Compass&quot; has made several observations about &quot;reconstruction&quot;
that you will not find in any of the &quot;history&quot; books. In commenting
about the Yankee attitude toward the South he has stated: &quot;The pre-War New
England attitude toward the South was that it was 'Egypt'--a land of oppression,
in which blacks were enslaved as were the ancient Hebrews. The Abolitionist
cadres regarded the postwar South as a dark land that had to be brought into
the light of the New England religion. The Army was sent by the Abolitionist
Congress to occupy and help to completely change the South's culture in every
aspect. It's leaders were to be cast down, it's social patterns upended, even
its pleasures altered. The region of racetracks and fast horses, of whiskey
distilling, of mint juleps and gambling, fancy balls and dancing, of
intellectual Calvinism...were to be relegated to the dead past in favor of New
England exaggerations about Puritanism, morality, Bunker Hill and Unitarian
literacy.&quot; The &quot;New England religion&quot; Scott referred to was
Unitarianism--Christ denying Unitarianism--and it was to be imported into the
South in an attempt to destroy the &quot;dead orthodoxy&quot; of Calvinism.
Anyone who thinks this War did not have theological implications has not read
history. Scott observed of the &quot;New England religion&quot; that it
&quot;was polished in stages into authoritarian socialism...&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>We labor under this today. It has been renamed
&quot;democracy&quot; and we are living under the misapprehension that this is
still a &quot;free&quot; country. In referring to the Northern elite, Scott
said that: &quot;Its attack upon the South, therefore, adopted a tone of moral
superiority from the 1830s onward...Emancipation was not enough. Equality was
demanded.&quot; Of course the blacks living in the North were not to be the
recipients of any of this &quot;equality&quot; only those in the South. Yankee
hypocrisy felt that blacks should, and must, vote in the South (as long as they
voted Republican), and that whites should be disenfranchised, but, not in their
back yards in the North! <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

Thaddeus Stevens once made the remark that if the blacks he saw in Lancaster
County (Pennsylvania) were a true example of all blacks everywhere, then they
were not fit to vote--yet he wanted them voting in the Southern states--just
not in Pennsylvania where he lived! Scott's contention, and the contention of
my friend in the South, are correct. After the war, the Northern armies and
hoards of government school teachers from the North descended upon the South
like a swarm of locusts, determined to drag the South, kicking and screaming,
into the &quot;modern era.&quot; Of course to do this, you had to instill in
Southern<br>
children what author John Chodes has called &quot;respect for national
authority.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>Part of this &quot;respect&quot; entailed
teaching Southern children to be ashamed of what their fathers, uncles, and
older brothers had fought for. Part of it was the promotion of New England
writers and poets in the newly formed government schools in the South, so that
future Southern students read poems, history, and &quot;literature&quot;
written by Unitarians instead of Southern writers. Much of this cultural
genocide has worked. Many Southern folks today are really ashamed of their
heritage, or they make milquetoast remarks like &quot;I just love my Southern
heritage, but then, it's really for the best that we lost the war.&quot; Why???
Was the &quot;Union&quot; preserved? A &quot;Union&quot; was preserved, but not
the original one. That died in 1865. What has been &quot;preserved&quot; is
what Otto Scott referred to as &quot;authoritarian socialism.&quot; That's what
we've got today, folks. The South lost the war, its culture has been under
attack for decades now, and North and South, we all live under
&quot;authoritarian socialism&quot; or, at best, some form of fascism, where we
are deluded into thinking we really own what we have, while the feds tell us
what we can and can't do with it, and when. The winners do, indeed, write the
'history&quot; books. &quot;Reconstruction&quot; worked well enough in the
South that, in one form or another, we now have it<br>
nationwide--and it's working so well now that most of us don't even realize it!

oral sex By Glen Owen, Education Correspondent<br>
A GOVERNMENT-backed course is encouraging pupils under 16 to experiment with
oral sex, as part of a drive to cut rates of teenage pregnancy. Family
campaigners believe that the course, called A Pause, is having the reverse
effect by exciting the sexual interest of children. The scheme, which has been
pioneered by Exeter University and is backed by the Departments of Health and Education,
trains teachers to discuss various pre-sex &quot;stopping points&quot; with
under-age teenagers. It aims to reduce promiscuity by encouraging pupils to
discover &quot;levels of intimacy&quot;, including oral sex, instead of full
sexual intercourse. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='color:navy'>More than 100,000 children are now taking the
course at one in every thirty secondary schools. It forms part of efforts to
tackle Britain's teenage pregnancy rate, which is the highest in Western
Europe. Robert Whelan, director of the Family Education Trust, said he hoped that
the Sexual Offences Bill, currently going through the House of Lords, would
lead to the course being banned. A provision in the Bill would make it an
offence for anyone to &quot;arrange or facilitate the commission of a child sex
offence&quot;. He said: &quot;I don't think anyone believes that teaching
pupils about oral sex will stop them having full sex - it is more likely to
make them want to try it, and it doesn't protect them from sexually transmitted
diseases.&quot; <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

that he was keen to teach children that &quot;it is acceptable simply to hold

clear that there are many ways to manage relationships - that it doesn't all
have to be about full sex,&quot; he said. He added that he was &quot;very
worried&quot; that the Bill would end the scheme. <br style='mso-special-character:

-- On the morning after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the hard work would begin.<br>
<br>
Ali Al-Attar is ready to lend a hand. The 39-year-old family practice physician
has joined with more than 200 other Iraqi exiles to prepare for potential
postwar crises, from cholera outbreaks to chemical weapons exposure. If given
the opportunity, he will go back to help put those plans into action.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have everything here, but I miss something important,&quot; he said.
&quot;I believe some part of me is still there. I'd like to go and fetch
it.&quot; These exiled Iraqi academics, professionals and technocrats, mostly
Americans, have embarked on a novel experiment in nation-building. <u>Organized

style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;color:navy'>participants in the Future of Iraq
project are attempting to address the myriad challenges of rebuilding a country
many of them have not visited in decades.<br>
<br>
&quot;The idea was to develop cadres of experts that would be available for a
post-Saddam world, as advisors to a new government,&quot; said Middle East
Institute Vice President David Mack, a former State Department official who
helped launch the $5-million project. &quot;It's never been done before.&quot; <u>(BS
we rebuilt every other Country that we have been in.....hell, they can use
their own oil money.)<br>
<br>
</u>For the most part, these are not the noisy opposition leaders whose public
feuds have rattled U.S. officials and alienated many Iraqis. In fact, some
officials hope that these experts will coalesce into a network capable of
providing more effective guidance than the opposition leaders who seem more
concerned with acquiring power than with empowering other Iraqis.<br>
<br>
&quot;These are the best of the best of the Iraqi exiles in their specialties
and their expertise,&quot; said Al-Attar, who was expelled from Iraq at the age
of 17. <u>(Probably for stealing huh ??)<br>
</u><br>
In 1980, Al-Attar arrived home from high school in Baghdad to find three of
President Hussein's secret police officers waiting for him. He was bused across
the desert and dumped at the Iranian border, along with members of 400 other
prominent Shiite Muslim families whose loyalty was questioned by Hussein's
regime.<br>
<br>
They walked for hours to reach the nearest town. Al-Attar helped set up tents
in a refugee camp where the temperature breached 110 by day and fell below
freezing at night. Some of the outcasts fell ill. Some died. Some never left.
&quot;I know people who were as affluent as we were, but they lost
everything,&quot; he said. &quot;They are still living in a tent in Iran. It
ruined their lives.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some Have Doubts<br>
<br>
Interviews with more than a dozen Future of Iraq participants reveal that some
harbor doubts <u>(as they well should</u>),&nbsp;about the depth of the Bush
administration's commitment to their plans, particularly their insistence on a
representative democracy. But most say they remain enthusiastic about the
project. <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;color:navy'>They
note that all but a few of the 16 working groups are tackling problems that
would confront Iraq no matter what form a new government might take.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have spent hundreds of hours on this,&quot; said Feisal Istrabadi, a
Chicago attorney ( Now you know this too is about linning the Pocket).
&quot;I've done so not because of some notion that if I keep putting one foot
in front of the other, there's going to be democracy in Iraq. I've done it
because this is Iraq's best hope. There's no other game in town.&quot;<br>
<br>
Foreign policy experts generally agree that the legacy of any U.S. military
action would depend in part on the involvement of Iraqis in the postwar
decision-making process. &quot;If we've learned anything from the Balkans, it's
that top-down solutions ï¿½ just add water and George Washington will spring up on
his horse ï¿½ are probably not the way to go,&quot; said policy analyst John
Hulsman at the conservative Heritage Foundation. &quot;In the long run, a
bottom-up approach is really the only way you can make this work.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Iraq, the view from the bottom is not pretty.<br>
<br>
Nijyar H. Shemdin, a native of northern Iraq who left the region in 1975 after
a failed Kurdish uprising, realized how bad things had become when he returned
in 1994 to bury his mother next to his father's grave in the city of Zakhu.<br>
<br>
Garbage trucks could not collect trash because their tires were worn out. Fire
engines were idled because of a lack of spare parts. Ambulances could not make
their runs, streets were riddled with potholes, water mains were broken and the
electrical system had been disconnected from the national grid.<u>( All this
sounds like a personal problem).<br>
</u><br>
&quot;It was the Iraqi government's way of saying, 'We don't want you,' &quot;
said Shemdin, the Kurdistan regional government's representative in Washington.
&quot;It was pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hatem Mukhlis, an emergency room surgeon in Binghamton, N.Y., knows what the
initial priorities would be: blood supplies and intravenous fluids. Antiseptics
and antibiotics. Clean food and purified water. Sewage and water treatment
repairs.<br>
<br>
Mukhlis is participating with Al-Attar on the public health working group. The
surgeon too is willing to go to Iraq to take part in the reconstruction and
help unite the population.<br>
<br>
&quot;My family name is well known, and I am well connected with Iraq as a
whole,&quot; said Mukhlis, whose grandfather fought to free Iraq from Ottoman
and British rule and whose father served as a military officer, ambassador and
member of parliament.<br>
<br>
Mukhlis has a dream. He wants to build a monument honoring victims of
government oppression, something that lists their names like the black granite
wall in Washington honoring Vietnam veterans.<br>
<br>
It would be located near Iraq's infamous Abu Ghraib prison. That's where
Mukhlis' father, Jasim, was executed in 1993, along with an uncle and a cousin.
&quot;I want parks and flowers and grass and fountains and names on a
monument,&quot; he said. &quot;I envision a place for Iraqis to have fun and
remember and pray for those who have died.&quot;(<u>are you feeling the shaft
yet ?)</u><br>
<br>
Los Angeles attorney Sermid Al-Sarraf got an early glimpse of where things were
headed under Hussein. In 1978, Al-Sarraf said, classmate Uday Hussein shot and
killed another young Iraqi in what was reportedly a drunken brawl. Uday's
father, Saddam Hussein, was Iraq's vice president at the time.<br>
<br>
Instead of holding the young man accountable, Al-Sarraf said, the government
expanded Uday's contingent of bodyguards and began transporting his desk to and
from school to prevent possible sabotage.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was clear the guy was a criminal at 14,&quot; Al-Sarraf said. &quot;There
was no issue of him being brought to trial. It was total impunity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Al-Sarraf's interest in human rights led to his participation in the
transitional justice working group. The panel has drafted guidelines for
determining which officials of Iraq's ruling Baath Party should face
prosecution for their actions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Iraqis are not familiar with questioning authority,&quot; he said.
&quot;They're not used to a law that encompasses everyone, where everyone is
accountable. Those elements need to be written into everything from the
constitution to the penal code.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rubar S. Sandi, who founded the U.S.-Iraq Business Council, wants to use his
expertise as an international investment banker(<u>the plot thickens)</u>&nbsp;to
recruit American companies and capital to rebuild Iraq. But first, he said,
Iraq must get its financial house in order. <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt;color:navy'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One of Sandi's big concerns is Iraq's
currency, the dinar. Before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, a dinar was officially
worth about $3. It has since plunged as low as 3,000 dinars to the dollar. Not
only that, every dinar printed in Iraq bears the likeness of the president.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's just not going to work,&quot; said Sandi, a Kurd who left Iraq
after a failed 1974 uprising.<br>
<br>
He wants to replace the dinars with a new currency, perhaps honoring famous
Iraqi writers, artists, scholars and politicians.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unfinished Business<br>
<br>
Muhammad Ali Zainy was finishing his PhD at the Colorado School of Mines in
1980 when two nephews, a young doctor and a dental student, were executed by
Hussein's government for joining an Islamic opposition group.<br>
<br>
Zainy returned to Baghdad and became a top advisor to the Iraqi oil minister.
Over the next two years, however, he became increasingly fearful for himself,
his wife and four children.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're constantly worried you must have said something that didn't please
the government, and they would come to your house at 3 o'clock in the morning
and sweep you and your family away to prison in your pajamas,&quot; he said.
(with the newer Patriotic Billm that can happen here.)<br>
<br>
In 1982, Zainy sent his wife and children to London. When the government sent
him to Vienna several weeks later to represent Iraq at an OPEC conference, he
hopped on another flight and defected.<br>
<br>
Zainy works at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. He is a member
of the oil and energy working group, which is devising plans to keep Iraq's
wells and refineries operating during and after a military offensive.<br>
<br>
Azzam Alwash fled Iraq after he was told in 1978 that he would have to join a
student organization affiliated with the Baath Party to receive a scholarship.
Now 44, he is a principal in Pacific Soils Engineering in Tustin, Calif.<br>
<br>
As a member of the water, agriculture and environment working group, he is
promoting a truly monumental reclamation project: restoring the vast marshes
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in southern Iraq.<br>
<br>
The swampy area was drained in the 1990s because it had become a refuge for
Shiite opposition groups. The marshes gradually dried up, leaving behind a
thick layer of salt and pollutants.<br>
<br>
Alwash, who as a child traversed the area in a boat with his father, has spent
several years researching Iraq's environmental debacle. With his wife, Suzie, a
geologist, he has developed a plan for restoring the marshes and hopes to see
it adopted if the U.S. succeeds in toppling Hussein. (The Greenies will love
him.)<br>
<br>
Like Al-Attar, he would like to put his professional expertise to work in Iraq.
But as long as Hussein remains in power, there is no chance of that happening.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm on the black list,&quot; he said. &quot;I could go back, but it would
be a very short trip. It would end up with my decapitation, I suppose.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

France is a medium-sized foreign country situated on the continent of Europe,

world community, although not nearly as important as it thinks.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>It is bounded by Germany, Spain, Switzerland
and some smaller nations of no particular consequence or shopping

country with many treasures such as the Louvre and EuroDisney. Among its contributions
to Western civilization are champagne, Camembert cheese, the guillotine, and
body odor. Although France likes to think of itself a modern nation, air
conditioning is little used and it is next to impossible to get decent Mexican
food. One continuing exasperation for American visitors is that the people
will- fully persist in speaking French, although many will speak English if
shouted at repeatedly. <br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½</span><br>
The People <br>
France has a population of 54 million people, most of whom drink and smoke a
great deal, drive like lunatics, are danger-ously over sexed and have no
concept of<br>
standing patiently in a line. The French people are generally gloomy,
temperamental, proud, arrogant, aloof and undisciplined; those are their good
points. Most French citizens are Roman Catholic, although you'd hardly guess it
from their behavior. Many people are Communis and topless sunbathing is common.
Men sometimes have girls' names like Marie and they kiss each other when they
hand out medals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>American travelers are
advised to travel in groups and to wear<br>
baseball caps and colorful pants for easier mutual recognition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>All French women have small tits, and don't
shave their armpits or their legs. <br>
<br>
Safety <br>
In general, France is a safe destination, although travelers are advised that
France is occasionally invaded by Germany.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½
</span>By tradition, the French surrender more or less at once and, apart from
a temporary shortage of Scotch whisky and increased difficulty in getting
baseball scores and stock market prices, life for the visitors<br>
generally goes on much as before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>A tunnel
connecting France to Britain beneath the English Channel has been opened in
recent years to make it easier for the<br>
French government to flee to London. <br>
<br>
History<br>
<br>
France was discovered by Charlemagne in the Dark Ages. Other important
historical figures are Louis XIV, the Huguenots, Joan of Arc, Jacques Cousteau
and Charles de Gaulle, who was President for many years and is now an airport.
The French armies of the past have had their asses kicked by just about every
other country in the world. Leaving them with the title of The Worlds Greatest
Parade Army!!! <br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½</span><br>
Government&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The French form of government is democratic but noisy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Elections are held more or less continuously
and always result in a run-off. For administrative purposes, the country is divided
into regions, departments, districts, municipalities, cantons, communes,
villages, cafes, booths and floor tiles. Parliament consists of two<br>
chambers, the Upper and Lower (although, confusingly, they are both on the
ground floor), whose members are either Gaullists or communists, neither of
whom can<br>
be trusted. Parliament's principal pre occupations are setting off atomic bombs
in the South Pacific and acting indignant when anyone complains.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>According to the most current State
Department intelligence, the current President is someone named<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Jacques. Further information is not
available at this time. <br>
<br>
Culture<br>
<br>
The French pride themselves on their culture, although it is not easy to see
why. All of their songs sound the same and they have hardly ever made a movie
that you want to watch for anything except the nude scenes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Nothing, of course, is more boring than a
French novel (except perhaps an evening with a French family.) <br>
<br>
Cuisine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Let's face it, no matter how much garlic you put on it, a snail is just a slug
with a shell on its back. Croissants, on the other&nbsp;hand, are excellent
although it is impossible for most Americans to pronounce this word. American
travelers are there fore advised to stick to cheeseburgers at McDonald's or the
restaurants at the leading hotels such as Sheraton or Holiday Inn. Bring your
own beer, as the domestic varieties are nothing but a poor excuse for such.
Could be the reason the Germans have been allowed to take over so many times. <br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½</span><br>
Economy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
France has a large and diversified economy, second only to Germany's economy in
Europe, which is surprising since people hardly ever work at all. If they are
not spending four hours dawdling over lunch, they are on strike and blocking
the roads with their trucks and tractors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½
</span>France's principal exports, in order of importance to the economy, are
wine, nuclear weapons, perfume, guided missiles, champagne, high-caliber
weaponry, grenade launchers, land mines, tanks, attack aircraft,<br>
miscellaneous armaments and cheese. <br>
<br>
Conclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
France enjoys a rich history, a picturesque and varied landscape and a
temperate climate. In short, it would be a very nice country if French people
didn't inhabit it, and it weren't still radioactive from all the nuclear tests
they run. The best thing that can be said for it is that it is not Spain.
Remember no one ordered you to go <br>
abroad. Personally, we always take our vacation in Miami Beach and you are
advised to do the same. If you speak Spanish!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½
</span>When advised that France had announced it would not assist, become
allied with or otherwise support the US in any war on Iraq, Perot reportedly
said: &quot;Having to go to war without France is sort of like having to go
deer hunting without an accordion&quot;<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The war also gave the French their first
taste of a Marlborough, which the have loved ever since.<br>
American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar, France claims
a win even though she barely participated. This is later known as the &quot;de

In the early 1900s, France procrastinated (noted for this) while Germany's

Hitler violated the Treaty of Versailles and went to war against his neighbors.
France procrastinated and tried to negotiate with Hitler. Hitler continued to ignore
France and the rest of the world. Instead of negotiating, he conquered France
in two weeks there was no parade then. America did not negotiate but came to
the aid of their friend, France. At a cost of more than a million American dead
(cemeteries in France and all over Europe attest to this) and wounded, and
millions of taxpayer dollars, America freed France. A decade or so later France
build an enclave in Vietnam called Dien Bien Fu. France felt they could
negotiate with the Communists who wanted to take over Vietnam. The Communists
destroyed Dien Bien Fu. Negotiations failed and America came to the aid of
their friend France. At a cost of hundreds of thousands of American dead and

Now France wants us to wait longer to see if negotiations will solve the
problem in Iraq. They want endless delay, removing another dictator, maybe with
the same disastrous consequences as with previous dictators.<br

THE SENATE AND TED KENNEDY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
There is liberal, and then there is just plain nuts. Senator Ted Kennedy fits
in the latter category. As unimaginable as it may seem the good Senator single
handedly tried to shut down NSEERS.&nbsp; NSEERS is the acronym for National
Security Entry-Exit Registration<br>
Program. This State Department program requires that all males from
Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco,
North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Tunisia, United Arab
Emirates, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen be finger printed before entry into the United
States. It also imposes reporting requirements once they are here. So far the
program has captured 330 known criminals trying to enter the United States
including six terrorists, two from Al Qauda. Late in the evening of January
23rd Senator Kennedy slipped an amendment into an appropriations bill striking
out the funds for NSEERS. The next day the massive $390 million bill was passed
69-29. Virtually no Senators voting for the bill knew what Kennedy had
done.&nbsp; <br>
In Ted Kennedy's warped mind, NSEERS is &quot;unconstitutional&quot; and
violates the &quot;rights&quot; of terrorists and illegal aliens. He just does
not understand that our Constitution was written for Americans like you and me
and not for Osama Bin Laden and his buddies.&nbsp; <br>
The Washington Times reported that Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) had worked with
the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) to figure out a way to kill
NSEERS. CAIR has a long history of supporting the terrorist group HAMAS.&nbsp;
There was no &quot;anti-NSEERS&quot; language in the House version of the
appropriations bill. This means the issue must be resolved in conference
committee held jointly by the House and Senate with other disputes over final
language. When the conference committee irons out differences the finished bill
goes back to the two bodies for final approval.&nbsp; At a meeting Wednesday a
senior White House official told me that under no circumstances would the
President sign the appropriations bill without funding for NSEERS. We can thank
God that George W. Bush is President, or Ted Kennedy would have gotten away
with this.&nbsp; Not satisfied with assisting terrorists getting into the
United States, Senator Kennedy introduced a &quot;clone and kill&quot; bill
along with Senators Diane Feinstein (D-CA) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT). The Human
Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2003 actually encourages
the creation of human life through cloning for the sole purpose of dissecting
and killing. Despite its title the bill encourages cloning and has virtually
nothing to do with stem cell research. The title of the bill seems to fit more
appropriately in the novel Brave New World than in Senate legislation.&nbsp;
Ted Kennedy and his crowd continually demean human life. He and other
supporters of the bill refer to human embryos as &quot;dots&quot; and
&quot;goldfish.&quot; (These &quot;goldfish&quot; become children. The
Nightlight Christian Adoption Agency actually saves frozen human embryos that
are &quot;extras&quot; at fertilization clinics and are headed for destruction.
They are adopted and implanted by infertile couples, some of whom have actually
brought their kids to Congress to testify against embryonic destruction.) With
this strange &quot;goldfish&quot; view of human life it does not seem odd at
all that Kennedy could fashion a bill that would allow the creation of human
life through cloning and then require that the life be ended before it is
implanted.&nbsp; <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

proposes that a human being be created for the sole purpose of harvesting

slaves. Kennedy proposes a far worse fate for the cloned.&nbsp; Those of us who
have assurance of eternal life through the shed blood of Jesus Christ should
have no fear of death. To us death is a mere transition from this life to one
which is better. On the other hand, those who do not know God want to cling to
every moment they can on this earth because their fate may be eternal hell.
These fearful people are willing to create human life and destroy it in some
vain attempt at prolonging their lives or making their lives on earth
better.&nbsp; <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

dollars to promote cloning and stem cell research to find a cure for his
paralysis. He has asked the Congress to spend many millions more to find a cure
for him. On the other hand, Joni Earekson Tada, a quadriplegic and founder of
the ministry Joni and Friends, supports the total anti-cloning bill presented
by Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS). His bill, co-sponsored in the Senate by
Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) would ban all cloning in the United States.&nbsp; <br>
What about the Raelians and their claim that they have cloned two babies? The
French founder of the Raelians is a fruitcake. His organization was chartered
in France as &quot;atheistic.&quot; Rael (Claude Vorilhon) claims that he has
met the Elohim (an ancient Hebrew word meaning &quot;those who come from the
sky&quot;) who cloned us all as an experiment. He says Christ is an Elohim and
that he has had conversations with him as well. The group holds
&quot;meditation&quot; meetings that turn into group sex sessions. Those
present report that that many of those who participate in the group orgies are
homosexual. Rael (Claude Vorilhon) requires the use of condoms at his

THE RETREAT and NOMINATIONS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Republican members of Congress went on a retreat Thursday and Friday to discuss
strategy and that effectively shut down the House and Senate for the week.
Republican Senators will plan their strategy for moving forward with the
judicial nominations President George W. Bush has made.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>Some of those have lingered for two
years!&nbsp; <br>
The first part of the week I did manage meetings with various congressional
leaders including Senator Inhofe (R-OK). All eyes are on the nomination of
Miguel Estrada to the Federal Circuit Court. Senator Ted Kennedy, who seems to
be everywhere (Has he been cloned?) is leading the &quot;filibuster&quot;
against Estrada. The left refers to Estrada as the &quot;Hispanic Clarence
Thomas&quot;. The left fears Estrada will eventually be nominated for the
Supreme Court and this could highlight the conservative part of the Hispanic
community. Because Democrats &quot;own&quot; the Hispanic vote, they want to
stop this at all costs. The left's opposition to Estrada has nothing to do with
the kind of judge he would make and everything to do with the fact that he is a
Hispanic who is conservative. If Estrada were a white man with the same views,
Ted Kennedy would not try to block his nomination. Ralph Neas, who heads the
ultra liberal People for the American Way, promised there would be
&quot;judicial Armageddon&quot; against Estrada and it appears that his tool is
Senator Kennedy. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

Protect Yourself from Terrorism and Martial Law. Tis better to err on the side

#1....<br>
Create a 30-day emergency supply of safe drinking water. Water is your most
vital commodity. You can live only a few days without it. So it's imperative
that you immediately create an emergency supply of safe water.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span>One gallon of safe water per person per day
is the bare minimum for survival. Most surplus stores can sell you inexpensive,
50-gallon plastic drums. Properly chlorinated tap water can be safety stored
for up to three months. Water purification tablets (vital in a crisis) are also
readily available from many surplus and earthquake supply stores.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#2....<br>
Stockpile essential medicines and life-saving antibiotics NOW. In the event of
a biological or radiological attack anywhere in the U.S., the government will
likely take control of all medical supplies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½
</span>This will lead to nationwide shortages and rationing, making it
impossible for you to get the medications you and your family depend on.<br>
Therefore, you should immediately ask your doctor to prescribe an emergency
supply of your regular medicines PLUS preventive antibiotics which can be used
to treat the most likely terrorist bio-weapons-anthrax and plague.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#3....<br>
Consider getting your family vaccinated for smallpox. As explained earlier, a
few terrorists on planes could create a nationwide plague before authorities
were even aware of it. Be sure to consult with your doctor about potential
risks.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

home. This is particularly important if you live in a very cold area of the
U.S. Even a few days without heat could be life threatening. Good alternatives
include pellet stoves and gasoline generators. Last winter I bought a 5,000-watt
Honda AC generator from Home Depot. My total cost, including installation
directly into my home's electrical system, came to about $1,200. This little
generator simultaneously powers two big refrigerators, my burners, microwave,
lights, one TV, a computer, and a couple of electric heaters. A few gallons of
gasoline give me power all day.<br>

Create an emergency hoard of gold and cash. If a terrorist attack forces you to
flee your home or a terrorist hacker attack disrupts our banking system, you
will definitely need cash and/or silver and gold. Make sure you have enough

his partner in double speak Al Sharpton demagogues and race dividers of the
first water. These two mental giants, are suggesting the (wonderful example of
black think) illogical and race dividing proposal that we reinstate a military
draft. This in their warped minds is to force the &quot;shared sacrifice of
war&quot; meaning of course that there is an overwhelming majority of blacks<br>
in the army and military in general! What a way to create dissension among the
many blacks and whites who have found a home in the military. This is their way
to play the race card at its immoral worst. These two make Machiavelli look
like a plaster saint. None of this matters if these two masters of racial
chicanery achieve their goal to make worse and continue the division between
white and black that does exist in our country. It is otherwise just a bad idea
whose time has not come! <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

those who earned it! Turn off the main roads in many places in the U.S. and
drive through rural slums, ground littered with rusted clunkers, children
living with rain sifting through holes and broken windows in rotten shotgun
shacks and trailers, the parents unemployed because the factories have moved to
countries with cheap labor like China. Many people were made homeless by the
tearing down sub standard low-income rental units. High taxes contribute to
making decent housing unaffordable. How about medical care here in the U.S.? A
woman needs medical treatment, which she can't afford, if she and her husband
are ever to have a family. However she has no insurance. She is taxed to pay
for Medicare and Medicaid, but can't qualify because she isn't old enough or
poor enough for these programs. A lady recently<br>
refused a biopsy because of the cost. With lower taxation, Americans would have
more to spend on health care. Proper use of our tax dollars includes schools,
libraries, and law enforcement. Our schools are in need of so many things
including better trained teachers!&nbsp; Our police are overwhelmed and our
courts too crowded for speedy justice. Mr.<br>
President, there are better uses for $15 billion - money stripped in taxes from
the working men and women of this country - than shipping it to Africa! <br
