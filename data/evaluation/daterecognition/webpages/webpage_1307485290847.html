      <h2>Welcome to Great River Air</h2>
      <p>
        <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">Headquartered in Whitehorse, with a major base in Dawson, we operate a superior charter service for clients that include government, multinational corporations and private individuals.</p>
      <p>Owner Craig Unterschute maintains that our company’s success largely originates from hiring a team of seasoned pilots that have over 50,000 hours of combined experience in northern operations.  “We know the Yukon like nobody else and wherever there is an airstrip, lake or river, one of us has probably landed on it at some point.” </p>
      <p>We also know the value of having the right tools for the job, and utilise aircraft carefully adapted for year-round operations in the Yukon’s demanding environment.</p>
      <p>While mining and exploration are our mainstay, wildlife and environmental surveys, forestry, aerial photography and tourism are also vital aspects of our business.</p>
