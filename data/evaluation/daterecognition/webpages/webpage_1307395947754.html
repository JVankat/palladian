    <td valign="top" class="textBody"> <p>Sonic the Hedgehog was such a popular 
        video game hero in the 1990s that when a new protein whose mutation created 
        spiny backs in fruit flies was discovered in 1993 it was named after him. 
        The original Sonic Hedgehog video game may have gone the way of the eight-track 
        audio cassette or the five-and-a-quarter-inch floppy disk, but the Sonic 
        hedgehog protein has only just begun its rise to fame. </p>

        In the 1990s Sonic the Hedgehog, a popular video game hero, gave his name 
        to a protein now known to control the size and shape of brain structures 
        during early development.</span></p>
      <p>
        A team of scientists led by chemical engineer David Schaffer has identified 
        the Sonic hedgehog protein as a critical &quot;cell fate switch&quot; 
        that can cause the normally small number of adult neural stem cells in 
        the hippocampus of the brain to proliferate. This discovery holds important 
        therapeutic implications for future treatments of brain damage suffered 
        as a result of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, strokes, 
        or head traumas. </p>
      <p>&quot;We have shown that the Sonic hedgehog network of proteins regulates 
        the proliferation of adult hippocampal neural stem cells both in vitro 
        and in vivo,&quot; says Schaffer. &quot;In studies with rats, increasing 
        the presence of Sonic hedgehog proteins in the hippocampus resulted in 
        a 3.3-fold increase in neural stem cell divisions.&quot; </p>
      <p>Schaffer holds appointments with the new Synthetic Biology Department 
        in Berkeley Lab's Physical Biosciences Division, UC Berkeley's Chemical 
        Engineering Department, and the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute. His 
        scientific focus has been on the use of molecular and cellular engineering 
        technology to treat biomedical problems. Prior to coming to UC Berkeley 
        five years ago, he did a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of 
        Fred Gage at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, where 
        he began his investigations into the Sonic hedgehog protein network.</p>
      <p>Most of the cells in the human body are specialists assigned to a specific 
        organ or type of tissue, such as the neuronal cells that wire the brain 
        and central nervous system. Stem cells are different. When they divide, 
        they can produce either more stem cells, or they can serve as progenitors 
        that differentiate into specialized cells as they mature. Hence the name, 
        because specialist cells can &quot;stem&quot; from them. </p>
      <p>The potential to differentiate into specialist cells whose populations 
        in the body have become critically depleted as the result of illness or 
        injury is what makes stem cells so potentially valuable to medical research. 
        The idea is that if the fate of a batch of stem cells could be directed 
        down specific pathways, they could be grown, harvested, and then transplanted 
        into a problem area. If all went according to plan, these new cells would 
        overcome damaged or diseased cells, leading to healing and recovery.</p>
      <p>&quot;The life of a stem cell can be viewed as a hierarchical branching 
        process, where the cell is faced with a series of fate switches,&quot; 
        Schaffer says. &quot;Our goal is to identify the cell fate switches, and 
        then provide stem cells with the proper signals to guide them down a particular 
        developmental trajectory.&quot;</p>
      <p>To date, most of the research &#151; and just about all of the publicity 
        &#151; about stem cell research has focused on those stem cells found in four-day 
        old human embryos, or blastocysts. These embryonic stem cells are prized 
        for medical research because they have the potential to become just about 
        any type of specialized cell in the body. </p>
      <p>However there are, in some types of tissue, pockets of adult stem cells 
        that have the potential to differentiate into the cells that make up their 
        host tissue. For example, adult neural stem cells residing in the hippocampus 
        and a region of the forebrain called the subventricular zone (SVZ) can 
        generate new neurons. Working with these adult stem cells offers some 
        advantages over embryonic stem cells, as Schaffer explains.</p>
      <p>&quot;First, adult stem cells don't present the ethical dilemma that 
        embryonic stem cells do, because harvesting them does not destroy the 
        donor. Also, they have already made some choices towards differentiating 
        along a specific developmental pathway, so that makes the job of directing 
        their future choices down that same pathway a little easier.&quot;</p>
      <p>In the case of the adult neural stem cells that Schaffer and his colleagues 
        work with, the developmental pathways include quiescence, death, self-renewal, 
        and differentiation down a number of neuronal lineages. Normally adult 
        neural stem cells are present only in minute quantities, and most of these 
        choose to remain quiescent. The first hurdle is to get the cells to proliferate.</p>
      <p class="fRt" style="width:350px"><span class="captionSm"> <img src="04-David_Schaffer.jpg" width="350" height="206"> 
        Chemical engineer David Schaffer identified the Sonic hedgehog protein 
        as a cell fate switch that can cause neural stem cells in adult rats to 
        proliferate.</span></p>
      <p>&quot;Adult neural stem cells don't seem to exist for the purpose of 
        replacing damaged neurons, but we believe that by identifying and learning 
        to manipulate the signals that control their proliferation and differentiation 
        we can use them for that purpose,&quot; Schaffer says. </p>
      <p>Toward this end he and his colleagues have taken both theoretical and 
        computational approaches to unmasking the regulatory elements in adult 
        neural stem cells. In their modeling work, they focused their investigations 
        on a few prime suspects, such as the Sonic hedgehog protein. This soluble 
        signaling protein was known to play a critical role in controlling the 
        proliferation of numerous mammalian cell populations during early development, 
        but little was known about its role in the adult stage.</p>
      <p>To determine the role of the Sonic hedgehog protein in adult mammals, 
        Schaffer and his colleagues harvested neural stem cells from rats, then 
        cultured these cells with Sonic hedgehog protein. Their success in boosting 
        the proliferation of neural stem cells in vitro led to in vivo experiments 
        with adult rats. </p>
      <p>The Sonic hedgehog gene was delivered to the hippocampus of each experimental 
        animal through a special virus, called an adeno-associated viral vector. 
        This genetic engineering resulted in the observed tripling of neural stem 
        cells. In addition, injecting cyclopamine, a known pharmacological inhibitor 
        of the Sonic hedgehog gene, significantly reduced neural stem cell proliferation 
        in test rats.</p>
      <p>&quot;The next step is to identify signaling proteins that regulate differentiation 
        in neural stem cells,&quot; says Schaffer. &quot;We'd also like to know 
        more about the mechanism by which the Sonic hedgehog network of proteins 
        is regulating stem cell proliferation. Cells are exposed to a lot of different 
        regulatory signals, which they must correctly interpret to carry out functional 
        decisions. We'd like to know more about how this information processing 
        system works.&quot; </p>

        In culture, the number of adult neural stem cells triples in the presence 
        of the Sonic hedgehog protein. The cells stained green in this image are 
        on their way to becoming neurons.</span></p>
      <p>A major challenge to the potential therapeutic value of adult stem cells 
        has been that these cells exist in small numbers that only decrease with 
        age. Discovering cell fate switches that can substantially boost neural 
        stem cell populations represents a big step forward. However, Schaffer 
        is quick to caution that it may be another 10 to 20 years before adult 
        neural stem cells play any significant role in therapy.</p>
      <p>&quot;With these neural stem cells, I think we're now at the stage that 
        research with monoclonal antibodies was in the 1980s,&quot; he says. &quot;However, 
        if we continue to make progress, the potential implications for medical 
        research are enormous.&quot;</p>
      <p>Collaborating with Schaffer on this research were Karen Lai and Matthew 
        Robertson, who are both with UCB's Chemical Engineering Department and 
        the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute. </p>
