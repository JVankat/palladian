Some of us may be wondering:  Whatever happened to Minix?  Is it dead?  Is anybody working on it?  It's older than Linux yet there's no Minix distros; there's PC-BSD and FreeBSD for FBSD, and there's tons of Linux distros, Nexenta for Solaris, so where the hell is Minx?!  Well, for those of you that curious, I've posted an <a href="http://bluefox.kicks-ass.org/blog/index.php/2006/10/27/why-is-nobody-working-on-minix/">entry on my blog</a> about it (<i>reproduced here for convenience</i>).  Spoiler:  Minix is only one year old!
</p>
<p>
What ever happened to <a title="Minix 3" href="http://www.minix3.org/">Minix</a>?  The kernel Torvalds imitated— but didn't steal, as some said—Tanenbaum's masterpiece <a title="Wikipedia on Microkernel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">microkernel</a>.  Minix is designed in such a way that if a particular component fails, it's reinitialized and replaced without causing failures elsewhere, effectively allowing the operating system to hold up to its own bugs.  Even though its design is interesting and possibly even revolutionary, it hasn't been developed out enough to truly take a place on the desktop along with Linux or FreeBSD.  Minix is modular, scalable, flexible, and even <a title="Minix News" href="http://www.minix3.org/news/">actively maintained</a>; but why after so much time is it still not useful?
</p>
<p>
In reality, it only <i>looks</i> like Minix isn't going anywhere—Linux and FreeBSD have desktop and server distributions; but there is no <a title="Ubuntu Linux" href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Minix, so it must be dead right?  The truth is that Minix 3 just arrived in 2005;  Minix 1 and 2 were primarily for research and education, but Minix 3 is actually being written for general purpose use.  Minix 3 is a fresh rewrite of the code base with a new goal, effectively making it a very young operating system.  It's no wonder there isn't a Minix distribution yet to compete with FreeBSD or <a title="Fedora Core" href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a>.  With a little time and effort, Minix could step into the OS scene along with Linux and BSD.
</p>
<p>
Minix is, in its own right, a workable operating system kernel.  It boots on x86, it has a good API, it runs drivers and functions on modern hardware, and it can run Xorg.  Still, it lacks a large number of drivers for hardware, and isn't going to get them for a while unless Minix becomes more popular.  Because Minix is the only workable microkernel I care to talk about, I'd like to remind the Open Source community that it's out there and give suggestions for working it into a useful kernel.
</p>
<p>
<a title="FreeBSD" href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, <a title="OpenBSD" href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, <a title="NetBSD" href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>, and <a title="Linux kernel" href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a> are all <a title="Wikipedia on Monolithic kernels" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel">monolithic kernels</a>, which means their entire core operating system code is run in the same context with extremely high privileges.  This includes drivers, security mechanisms, syscall servicing, networking, process scheduling, and memory management.  It's one big, constantly growing blob.  This design is okay, but it lacks diversity; not one of our popular open source operating systems is a microkernel, which means that nobody anywhere can truly comment on the microkernel design.
</p>
<p>
Minix is a true microkernel, but it isn't ready for the mainstream.  What Minix lacks is mainly a large number of drivers, in the same way Linux is missing a large number of Wifi drivers.  Think of what it's like getting Wifi to work on Linux, where no USB drivers exist and the most common hardware found in Laptops doesn't work out of the box; even if you do get any of it working, you don't have all the features, like WPA.  Now to imagine Minix, propagate this trouble to <i>all</i> of your hardware, aside from the basic must-work-to-run drivers like generic IDE.
</p>
<p>
The single most important thing the open source community could do for Minix is <strong>port hardware drivers to it</strong>.  Remember that Minix is under the BSD license; it is theoretically harmless to begin porting drivers directly from FreeBSD into Minix.  Drivers from OpenBSD and NetBSD could be ported as well, depending on what code bases those doing the porting are most familiar with.  It may even be possible to port from Linux, although the drivers developed would have to ship separately under GPL2.
</p>
<p>
For further consideration, the idea of porting drivers "to Minix" is nonsense really; it's more porting them to the various APIs Minix offers and writing new APIs and servers to service the drivers that need them.  One idea is to write a driver server that can glob to an unmodified FreeBSD driver by supplying an API mimicing FreeBSD's kernel internals at a specific point, and then ripping the drivers out of the tree verbatim; this is a <a title="Projects Minix needs" href="http://www.minix3.org/projects.html">suggested project on the Minix site</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is an advantage to porting drivers directly to Minix, rather than using a FreeBSD or Linux driver model server.  The API and ABI for Linux and FreeBSD change often enough to be considered unstable or volatile; however, Minix is specifically designed to stay the same.  Not only do the ABIs generally not change; but if they ever do, the servers involved can be forked and the original ABIs can be used in compatibility servers.  In either case, the Minix ABI could be ported back to Linux or FreeBSD and Minix drivers could compile directly for those systems without alteration; although key developers for Linux at least do not accept static driver ABI models.
</p>
<p>
Minix also needs a way to integrate with distributions like Ubuntu, RedHat, or FreeBSD, which use Linux or FreeBSD kernels.  I believe porting C libraries and supporting infrastructure to Minix is a backwards approach; Minix is a microkernel, it's completely modular, and it's easy to add operating system functionality to, so <strong>port it to the environment</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Want <a title="Ubuntu Linux" href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Minix?  Write a <i>modprobe</i> program for Minix and write a Minix server to support <i>udev</i> and <i>hal</i>, as well as export <i>procfs</i> and <i>sysfs</i>.  Create a legitimate Linux syscall table for Minix, which is set to be used when Minix runs user space programs for Linux.  Teach Minix to read <i>initrd</i> and <i>initramfs</i> contents and make sure the boot menu for <i>grub</i> pulls that module in with the <i>module</i> command whenever these are used.  A few programs may need modification, but it should be possible to fool the ones that ask <i>modprobe</i> to load a module into not caring that it's a Minix server and not a Linux kernel object being loaded.
</p>
<p>
Want MinixBSD?  Do the same for FreeBSD or OpenBSD, export the proper <i>/dev</i> naming convention if the kernel ever emits a <i>devfs</i> or cares about <i>/dev</i>, and bootstrap FreeBSD with a Minix kernel.  There's no reason why the same Minix kernel can't load different servers to emulate Linux or BSD; you could probably even build a <a title="ReactOS" href="http://www.reactos.org/">ReactOS</a> infrastructure around it with a large amount of elbow grease.  Taking it a step further, because all memory management and driver stuff happens outside the kernel, you could probably use Minix itself as a hypervisor like Xen with, again, a measure of work.
</p>
<p>
Microkernels are interesting things, and show potential in the mainstream and embedded markets.  It is unfortunate that the design of microkernels is currently being dismissed, because the entire technical view is totally reduced to fluff; the only judgments anyone can currently make are that monoliths haven't met the apocalypse and nobody's deployed a true Microkernel in large scale on the desktop yet, so real comments on the strengths and weaknesses of microkernels are all academic.  It's time to break the mold and introduce one major desktop-ready microkernel to the market.
