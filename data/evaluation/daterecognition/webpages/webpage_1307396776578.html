      <p align="center"><font size="5" color="#000000"><em><strong>Re-examining 
        the Heads of the Beast From a Current Perspective</strong></em></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="3" color="#000000">by J.L. Haynes</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">I am currently reading, <em>A Commentary 
        on the Revelation of St. John</em>, by Samuel Garratt (3rd edition, 1897).&nbsp; 
        Very, very interesting interpretation of some of the details in Revelation!&nbsp; 
        Mr. Garratt's writing is challenging some of my previous assumptions.&nbsp; 
        My own thoughts on this interesting interpretation could suggest that 
        the &quot;heads&quot; of the beast in Rev 13 &amp; 17 have ramifications 
        in the present day.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">&nbsp; The five heads &quot;that were&quot; 
        are the five previous forms of Roman government prior to the time when 
        John received this vision: kings, consuls, decemvirs, military tribunes, 
        triumvirs.&nbsp; The one &quot;that is&quot; is that of &quot;emperors&quot;.&nbsp; 
        The seventh &quot;must remain a little while,&quot; but what is it?&nbsp; 
        This beast &quot;once was and now is not&quot; (Rev 17:11) and when it 
        reappears will become an eighth which is the final form of Roman government 
        that will exist at the coming of Christ.&nbsp; The words, &quot;now is 
        not...&quot; are applicable at the time indicated by the vision John was 
        seeing then:&nbsp; of the woman riding the beast having already reached 
        maturity in her persecution of the saints (17:6).&nbsp;&nbsp;By that description, 
        we could suggest that the Roman church was drunk on blood anytime from 
        the 16th century until now.&nbsp; But the actual time of the vision in 
        real history must also coincide with a period when the seventh head, which 
        ''once was,&quot; is not.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The sixth head was that of &quot;emperors&quot;.&nbsp; 
        I have usually maintained that this form disappeared with the fall of 
        Romulus Augustus in 476.&nbsp; He was the last Western Emperor to rule 
        from Rome itself.&nbsp; But the fact (which has often troubled me) is 
        that historically, Justinian, the Eastern Emperor, was declared by Odoacer,&nbsp;chief 
        of the Heruli invaders and new conquering king of Rome, to be the Emperor 
        of both East AND West.&nbsp; This has troubled me because it meant that 
        REALLY, there was still an emperor even if he resided in the East.&nbsp; 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">So when was there NOT an emperor of 
        the Roman, or Holy Roman, Empire?&nbsp; The title of Western Emperor was 
        regained under Charlemagne in 800, but it was only a modification: the 
        presence of an emperor over the empire was a constant.&nbsp; Even when 
        the Eastern Empire fell to the Turks in 1453, the Emperor of Germany bore 
        the title of Roman Emperor--he was acknowledged as the head of the European 
        Commonwealth.&nbsp; This was titular mainly, and fits nicely with the 
        vision of chapter 17's focus on the HORNS ( the nation kings), and not 
        the presence of the head in verse 16; and with the lonely mention of the 
        horns without reference to the head in Daniel 7:7-25, when the return 
        of the Lord is described.&nbsp; The head was not a major detail from Daniel's 
        perspective--being concerned with events that were still at least 2500 
        years away.&nbsp; However, being forced by Napoleon, the German emperor 
        Francis, in 1806, renounced the &quot;throne of the Caesars&quot; and 
        declared himself only emperor of Austria.&nbsp; Napoleon won the title 
        Emperor of France, and tried to identify his government with Roman character, 
        but he was not a Caesar of the Western Roman Empire--that title was abandoned 
        by Francis, not transferred to Napoleon.&nbsp; Napoleon instituted the 
        seventh head under himself.&nbsp; John wrote that this head would &quot;remain 
        a little while&quot;, (Rev 17:10).&nbsp; He also wrote in chapter 13:12 
        that it would be wounded with a &quot;fatal wound.&quot; And in 13:14, 
        that it would be wounded &quot;by the sword.&quot;&nbsp; This unique description 
        fits the way that the Napoleanic head was brought to an end: by&nbsp; 
        foreign invasion at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.&nbsp; Never since 
        has there been a single head of Western Europe.&nbsp; There has been no 
        single Roman government over the ten horns in Europe.&nbsp; Satan has 
        tried, not&nbsp;knowing exactly how these prophecies were to be fulfilled, 
        to establish the eighth head--&nbsp; through the Franco-Prussian war, 
        the First World War, the Second World War (all of these instigators, Napoleon 
        III, Prussia, and Hitler, sought the revival of the Western Roman Empire.&nbsp; 
        All of them failed. So the Beast that &quot;one was, now is not.&quot;&nbsp; 
        There is not, by this interpretation, a head over the Roman beast at this 
        time.&nbsp; This gives an interesting perspective of the frantic evil 
        of the wars in Europe over the last two centuries as Satan tried to revive 
        the seventh head of the Roman/European beast.&nbsp; But the facts of these 
        evil wars are in themselves an indication of the correctness of this interpretation.&nbsp; 
        No head has existed over Europe since Napoleon; but there has been a&nbsp;repeated 
        and bloody effort to establish one. &nbsp; </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">There is yet another not improbable 
          mode in which the revival of the ten-horned beast might be accomplished.&nbsp; 
          The triumph of the French Republic would almost certainly result in 
          the formation of republics all over the Roman earth.&nbsp; This is what 
          is meant by the phrase &quot;the United States of Europe.&quot;&nbsp; 
          The secret societies are said to cherish the design of a grand European 
          revival of the Roman Republic.&nbsp; The second, third, fourth, and 
          fifth heads of the ten-horned beast were all republican, and the establishment 
          of a system of European Republics would be the rising up of another 
          head, one &quot;of the seven.&quot;&nbsp; The beast is to be identical 
          with the eighth head, &quot;he is the eighth,&quot; (Rev 17:11) which 
          seems to require either a Republic or a Democratic Empire.&nbsp; The 
          Church of Rome would accommodate itself with equal ease to a Holy Roman 
          Empire or the United States of Europe.&nbsp; Each, as far as I can see,&nbsp;would 
          be a fulfilment of the prophecy.&nbsp; The ten horns might be ten kingdoms 
          or ten republics, but as the horns of the beast in Dan 7 are identical 
          with the toes of the image in Dan 2, and the stone cut out without hands 
          is to smite the image on its ten toes, the number must be ten at the 
          close, as well as at the beginning; and it seems too likely that England 
          will be one of them. In which of these ways the fourth of Daniel's beasts 
          or the Western Roman Empire is to be revived, or in what other way, 
          I do not think prophecy determines; but its revival in some form,--royal, 
          republican, or imperial,--seems absolutely required by the prediction.

          have resolved to reverse the euro's relentless slide by launching the 
          EU on a fresh course of political integration during a summit near Paris 
          this week....The summit at Rambouillet next Friday has been designated 
          the stage for a Franco-German rapprochement. Among ideas to be discussed, 
          listed in a radical speech by Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, 
          are a new EU constitution for the &#145;European citizen&#146;, an elected 
          president for the Union and a radical reform of the EU founding treaty 
          to give &#145;a long-term political perspective on the Union's future&#146;&#133;In 
          a key speech in Berlin on Friday, which aides said had been written 
          after &#145;long discussions&#146; with his French counterpart Hubert 
          Vedrine, Mr. Fischer, said that the creation of a currency union meant 
          that a complementary political union had become a necessity...He advocated 
          setting up a single European government, a more powerful European parliament 
          with two chambers, and an elected &#145;President of Europe&#146;...Francis 
          Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said the revelations had &#145;spectacularly 
          blown the lid off Europe's superstate agenda&#146;&#133; The idea that 
          economic and monetary union would generate the need for further political 
          integration in Brussels is not a new one. Jacques Delors, the French 
          former president of the European Commission, considered it the hidden 
          gamble of the euro project. Once a single currency was in place, Mr 
          Delors, along with Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand, anticipated 
          that electorates inside the euro zone would demand a political counterweight 
          to the European Central Bank, which is responsible for running the new 
          currency...&quot;&nbsp; <br>

          INTEGRATION May 20, 2000 <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;The London Times reported: &#147;The leaders of France and Germany 
          met in conclave in the French countryside last night to discuss closer 
          European union. It could start this year with a scheme for member states 
          to band together in an embryo &#145;hard core&#146;. In talks with Chancellor 
          Schr�der at Rambouillet, southwest of Paris, President Chirac and Lionel 
          Jospin, the French Prime Minister, were pushing the concept of &quot;reinforced 
          co-operation&quot; among willing states as a FrancoGerman priority when 
          France takes over the six-monthly EU presidency in July&#133;French 
          ideas for widening the co-operation scheme, already enshrined in limited 
          form in the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, were given new life this week 
          when Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, painted a bold vision 
          of a fully federal Europe based on a Franco-German &#145;center of gravity&#146;. 
          Monetary union and the EU's current push for a defense arm are already 
          examples of such &#145;alliances of the willing&#146;. However, Britain, 
          Spain and their EU allies take a dim view of arrangements that could 
          promote a hard core while sidelining other member states. Poland and 
          other eastern European states are alarmed at the prospect of exclusion 
          to an outer circle when they join the EU over the next few years&#133;Supporters 
          of the approach see it as the only way of ensuring that an enlarged 
          EU is not paralysed by vetos from Britain and other states opposed to 
          deeper integration. Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, 
          yesterday hailed the push for &#145;reinforced co-operation&#146; in 
          next December's Treaty of Nice as a welcome step. The scheme should 
          &#145;not just be used for secondary issues but for the most important 
          ones&#146;, he said. &#145;From now on, it is difficult to draw the 
          line between such reinforced co-operation and a federal Europe&#146;...&#148;&nbsp;

          German plan for a federal Europe was given authoritative French backing 
          yesterday when Laurent Fabius, the Finance Minister, welcomed it as 
          a road map for turning the European Union into a &#145;federation of 
          nation states&#146;. M Fabius, who is Deputy Prime Minister in the Government 
          of Lionel Jospin, broke with the caution shown so far by the Government 
          towards the ambitious scheme drawn up by Joschka Fischer, the German 
          Foreign Minister. Herr Fischer's ideas were &#145;important and very 
          interesting,&#146; as a guide for the political organization of Europe, 
          he said. The EU, which comes under French presidency in July, should 
          proceed towards deeper integration led by a Franco-German &#145;avant-garde&#146; 
          as suggested by the German minister, he added. By 2007, when the EU 
          will mark its 50th anniversary of its founding Treaty of Rome, &#145;it 
          would be a fine aim for our generation to prepare by then an adequate 
          political structure...whether one calls it a federation of nation states 
          or co-sovereignty,&#146; he said...&#148; </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Agence France Presse reported: &#147;<b>France's 
          President Jacques Chirac issued an impassioned plea Tuesday for a European 
          defense structure, and called for an EU rapid reaction force to police 
          the northern Mediterranean.</b> In a speech delivered a month before 
          France takes over as European Union president, Chirac also proposed 
          a summit meeting with states from the former Yugoslavia to encourage 
          the process of democratization there. Addressing representatives of 
          the defense body, the Western European Union, Chirac said that backing 
          up a joint foreign policy via a credible defense capacity was a crucial 
          next step in forging a European identity. &#145;The EU must make its 
          voice better heard on the international scene...We are not lacking in 
          conviction or courage. What we need is cohesion and -- let us face it 
          -- political vision,&#146; he said. Chirac said that a priority in France's 
          six month presidency would be to press forward on commitments made at 
          the Helsinki summit last December to have a European corps of up to 
          60,000 men capable of deploying by the year 2003. &#145;It seems to 
          me that the time has come to consider reinforcing Europe's rapid reaction 
          capabilities, especially in southern Europe. There is scope for the 
          establishment of a new European rapid reaction force to intervene in 
          the northern Mediterranean,&#146; he said. Prospects for a European 
          defense arm have advanced dramatically in the last 18 months...&quot;

          European Commission is considering radical plans for an elected president 
          and a federal constitution to bind the European Union closer together 
          before the next round of enlargement.</b> Michel Barnier, the European 
          commissioner in charge of reform, has given warning that the EU will 
          slide into crisis, becoming &#145;unpopular&#146;, &#145;useless&#146; 
          and &#145;incapable of decision-making&#146; unless Europe's leaders 
          rise to the challenge and draft a visionary document as the basis for 
          the next constitutional treaty in December. At a meeting with fellow 
          commissioners in Strasbourg, M Barnier said the status quo was not sustainable. 
          <b>The only question was whether the EU should be a &#145;federal&#146; 
          state in the conventional sense, modeled on the United States or Germany, 
          or whether it should pursue the goal of political union through other 
          means.</b> &#145;Everybody knows that Europe's current institutions 
          can't work with 30 countries,&#146; he told The Telegraph after the 
          meeting. &#145;If we can't find the courage to change the mechanism, 
          we're going to face a general blockage of all EU activity. The British 
          Government sees this too, and I'm confident that they will accept the 
          need for fundamental change in the end.&#146;...&quot; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">&quot;...<b>Francis Maude, the shadow 
          foreign secretary, said the Barnier proposals showed that &#145;the 
          EU superstate agenda is alive and well&#146; and the Government must 
          &#145;stop pretending&#146;.</b> M Barnier said the creation of the 
          euro entailed a &#145;federal logic&#146;, arguably requiring a new 
          federal structure with a directly elected president and a bicameral 
          parliament with full legislative powers. <b>It would also have a &#145;supreme 
          court&#146; to act as guardian of a &#145;simple, clear constitution&#146; 
          that all the children of Europe could learn by heart. The revamped commission 
          should have a directly elected president to give it &#145;democratic 
          legitimacy&#146;, with a vice-president in charge of foreign policy 
          and defense and powers to dissolve the European Parliament.</b>&quot;
