        <div class="entry">
          <p>From a speech back in 2004 comes this telling quote:&nbsp; <br /><span style="color: #ffffff;">&gt;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #000000;">&quot;One other thing I&#8217;ve done, is I&#8217;ve called on private sector mortgage banks and banks to be more aggressive about lending money to first-time home buyers. And the response has been really good. There&#8217;s a lot of people in this &#8212; our communities around the country that deeply care about the issue of homeownership, and they&#8217;ve been responsive.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">- <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/03/20040326-15.html">George W. Bush</a>, U.S. President, March 26, 2004. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Its important to understand how this situation occurred in the first place, if we want to be able to fix it. Blaming the CRA and Fannie/Freddie is a total misunderstanding of how the problem occurred, and what we need to do to fix it now, and avoid doing it again in the future. </span></p>
<p>To repeat my prior arguments, the proximate cause of the Housing crisis were 1) Ultra-low rates; and 2) Abdication of traditional lending standards, thanks to 3) originators ability to resell mortgages for securitization purposes, and hence, 4) not have to worry about loan defaults.</p>
<p>The credit crisis was caused by 1) the above securitized mortgage paper, that was 2) rated triple AAA by Moody&#8217;s and Standard &amp; Poors, which then 3) Which was then &quot;insured&quot; by credit default swaps (CDS) &#8212; the unreserved for, shadow insurance products 4) whose exemption was made possible by the Commodities Futures Modernization Act. That legislation exempted these derivatives from any supervision or regulation. The lack of reserve requirements is why there is now $62 trillion in CDS, many of which will never pay their counter parties the promised insurance.</p>
<p>If you are going to blame Fannie/Freddie/CRA, or George Bush or Barney Frank, you are missing the big picture. </p>

			<p>&#8220;Warren Buffett for Treasury Secretary&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll bet the Oracle&#8217;s kicking himself.  When you take one of those government jobs you get to unload your assets tax free.  I hear his basis in BRK is fairly low.</p>

			<p>Don&#8217;t forget that a lot of subprime/Alt-A activity was due to flippers speculating on newly-built/renovated homes. These were 2 and 3rd houses (and 12th in some cases) that were financed as &#8220;vacation&#8221; homes even though the borrower had no intention of living in the house.</p>

			<p>It is realistic to blame both.  Recall that HUD (which had a good deal of influence over banks and the GSE&#8217;s) demanded increases in &#8220;affordable&#8221; lending when Andy Cuomo ran it.</p>
<p>&#8216;One or the other&#8217; doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>

			<p>While I agree that rates were too low, my hunch is that securitization would have still occurred at 3 or 4% given the kind of &#8220;vig&#8221; on the table for the CDO/CDS.  This kind of securitization was still happening after the rates rose.  I&#8217;m still pointing my finger at Wall Street as I think we all knew or at least we know now that none of these &#8220;hot shot&#8221; financiers had a clue about risk.  I remember my Wharton professors saying you could answer any question in business with one word &#8220;risk&#8221; and nobody really understood risk.</p>

			<p>There are a couple of big factors I think you&#8217;re leaving out.  Low rates were a function of a) low target rates, b) flatter yield curve, and c) low spreads.  Therefore, massive global demand for &#8220;low risk&#8221; assets (esp. as a result of Chinese mercantilism) and a ready supply in the form of Agencies and other CMOs were essential contributors to the crisis.  The implicit guarantee on Fannie and Freddie was a classic &#8220;free lunch&#8221; until the bill came due.  I&#8217;m sure there will be academic studies which try to estimate Fannie/Freddie&#8217;s impact (given their size) on risk premia across fixed income, as I&#8217;m sure there will be studies which compare their losses to those caused by private MBS, not to mention CDS&#8211;both of which on the surface are more ridiculous concepts.  I&#8217;ll go out on a limb and guess nobody explained this in last night&#8217;s Presidential debate.</p>

			<p>Barry, you are blaming a set of abstracts.<br />
The REAL cause is neither abstract nor impersonal: it is plain human avarice, ignorance, and keeping up with the Joneses.</p>
<p>Only when those characteristics are firmly in place in a person can all the other factors kick in for the kill&#8230;..</p>
<p>Until each and every one takes responsibility for their personal part in this scheme, nothing will change (no bailout, no regulation, no voting the politicians out).</p>
<p>No more blaming and a whole lot more humble pie on the part of every one! It is really THAT simple.</p>

			<p>Without a convenient government sponsored entity to buy the poorly underwritten mortgage paper, the banks would have been forced to actually conduct due dilligence when they lent money.  To that extent, the government sponsored &#8216;homeownership society&#8217; which intended to promote homeownership but ended up making homes excessively expensive, has to shoulder a good amount of the blame.</p>

			<p>I agree with BR.</p>
<p>What also exacerbated the residential real estate bubble was Federal tax policy that favored speculation, i.e. deductibility of home mortgage interest, points, etc.</p>
<p>By allowing taxpayers to exclude from their taxable income up to $500,000 of gains from the sale of a personal residence, the government&#8212;driven by the real estate industry&#8212;played a key role in turning home ownership into a speculative enterprise.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t say politicians were exempt from blame, he said the impact of Bush/Frank was marginal in the scheme of things as was that of F/F and the CRA who the right are trying to shove the blame onto. And he&#8217;s surely correct. Your conservative bias is showing I&#8217;m afraid. What BR is pointing up is the danger of creating these false narratives for political purposes when you&#8217;re trying to avoid them in the future. America has always had a bit of penchant  for believing its own propaganda but it seems to have assumed monumental proportions over the past 15 years. The consequences are all around us economically, politically and diplomatically. We&#8217;ve already started on the first steps of our relative decline, there seems no reason to accelerate the process by blinding ourselves to realities.</p>

			<p>Is it at all practical to outlaw CDS unless you are a holder of the debt in question? We need to get rid of the speculation in this marketplace. Housing, oil all of it. I can see re-insurance as a risk mitigation effort. Why not the same approach for CDS?</p>

<p>*******</p>
<p>BR,</p>
<p>I agree with you 100% about the causes. It was a series of systemic issues that encouraged excessive risk.  And rational persons (greedy or otherwise) will look to maximize their results within that system (i.e.  buy a bigger house, obtain a higher return).</p>
<p>And, John (2), your point is well taken &#8211; but who, in the &#8220;big picture&#8221;, shall I hold accountable (blame, if you will) for setting up that system??</p>
<p>Well let&#8217;s just think about that:</p>
<p>1.  A quick wiki search reveals:</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8220;Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000&#8243; [H.R. 5660 was introduced in the House on Dec. 14, 2000 by Rep. Thomas W. Ewing [R-IL] and cosponsored by Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. (R-VA) Rep. Larry Combest (R-TX) Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-NY) Rep. Jim Leach (R-IA) and never debated in the House.[2]</p>
<p>The companion bill (S.3283) was introduced in the Senate on Dec. 15th, 2000 by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) and cosponsored by Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-IL) Sen. Phil Gramm (R-TX) Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) Sen. Thomas Harkin (D-IA) Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) and never debated in the Senate.[2]&#8221;</p>
<p>NEVER DEBATED IN EITHER HOUSE OF CONGRESS!!<br />
Paulson got his moneys worth from those lobbyists.</p>
<p>2. SEC chair Cox is still waiting for someone to explain his job to him.</p>
<p>3. Congressman Artur Davis of Alabama issued the following statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a lot of my Democratic colleagues I was too slow to appreciate the recklessness of Fannie and Freddie. I defended their efforts to encourage affordable homeownership when in retrospect I should have heeded the concerns raised by their regulator in 2004. Frankly, I wish my Democratic colleagues would admit when it comes to Fannie and Freddie, we were wrong. By the way, I wish my Republican colleagues would admit that they missed the early warning signs, that Wall Street deregulation was overheating the securities market and promoting dangerously lax lending practices. When it comes to the debacle in our capital markets, there is much blame to go around for both sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>4.  and you gotta love this one, from a 2004 oversight hearing about the GSEs:</p>
<p>REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF.: There were nearly a dozen hearings where frankly we were trying to fix something that wasn&#8217;t broke. Mr. Chairman, we do not have a crisis at Freddie Mac and in particular at Fannie Mae under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Frank Raines.</p>
<p>Maxine baby, you are ready to be a SNL player.  ROTFLOL!</p>
<p>5.  Well, that is all I have time for, but the list goes on and on and on, Dems and Repubs alike.</p>
<p>So, I would assert that in the search for the corrections, we have to understand how we arrived here.  Did someone make a Bad Call?  Did some group let a major issue slide by without debate?  Were any important regulators asleep at the switch?</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. Damn, that is all I have left.</p>

			<p>Not the causes. And, that is the reason why this fat tail is so misunderstood.  Everyone is focusing on correlation = causation.  Housing cannot bring down the economy.  Nor can the debt associated with it.  It can mute the economy for some time.  In a certain sense, housing is completely irrelevant.</p>

			<p>That&#8217;s a good summary, Barry.  What I&#8217;m missing though is why Fannie &amp; Freddie aren&#8217;t tied directly to point 2: the ability of banks and other lenders to sell the bad loans thus off-loading the risk.  I&#8217;m still not convinced that this whole thing could have occurred without F&amp;F (and, thus, the US government) implicity, if not explicitly, backstopping the losses.  Could you explain that if you get a chance?</p>

			<p>I would also add that legislation designed to make it more difficult to bankrupt your way out of debt mean creditors would literally &#8220;own you soul&#8221; until you make good on it.</p>
<p>While deadbeats normally ought to pay their debt, predatory lending practices leveled at unsophisticated borrowers exacerbated the problem.</p>

			<p>If you are going to blame Fannie/Freddie/CRA, or George Bush or Barney Frank, you are missing the big picture.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Barry, I think you&#8217;re missing the picture.  Ultimately there were people behind the decisions that got us to where we are.  Gramm-Leach-Bliley didn&#8217;t became law by itself; Fannie/Freddie&#8217;s problems didn&#8217;t grow out of the blue; SEC didn&#8217;t relax its rules and oversight responsibilities on its own; years of warnings regarding Fannie and Freddie and the subprime market in general weren&#8217;t figments of people&#8217;s imaginations . . .</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve identified the organizational players and flow in the mess &#8211; but behind it all were a lot of people who made a lot of poor decisions.  These people are the real culprits, and ultimately their involvement needs to be detailed.</p>

			<p>Low rates cause foreclosures? Huh?</p>
<p>[<b>BR</b>: Not low rates, you tool -- ultralow rates  that cause a wild housing boom and bust -- try not to be so dense]</p>
<p>The CRA requires banks to lend to people with bad credit, or else the bank is labelled &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;redliner.&#8221;<br />
[<b>BR</b>: No, the CRA sets soft guidelines. No irresponsible lending is required -- can you can point us to some legislation or rule that insists that lending standards be abandoned ? ]</p>
<p>The only way to lend to bad credit risks is to eliminate lending standards. Banks did not WANT to lend to deadbeats. They were forced to.  [<b>BR</b>: This is a patently false statement.]</p>
<p>Mortgage brokers are greedy bastards, yes. But they were created by FANNIE and FREDDIE, which created the market for no down payment, no documentation loans.  [<b>BR</b>: Again, this is incorrect.]</p>
<p>If Fannie and Freddie wouldn&#8217;t buy those loans, they would never get originated in the first place. It is you sir, who is missing the big picture.</p>
<p>[<b>BR</b>: Actually, the loans had been getting made for many years priors to Fannie &amp; Freddie getting into the subprime space. But that is a fact, and you apparently are unfamiliar with facts]</p>
<p>Government can OUTLAW lending to illegal aliens, or it can FORCE BANKS to lend to illegal aliens. Our government forces banks to lend to illegal aliens. Just as the police can be forced to arrest illegal aliens, or be forced to NEVER ASK about alien status.</p>
<p>~~~<br />
<b>BR</b>:  You obviously dont understand banking or finance laws, or banking rules. These are empty and false political slogans, and they have no place here.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but you are simply spouting political nonsense. Get some data and facts if you want to be taken seriously around here</p>

<p>I do not think the gov forced anyuone to lend to anybody.  Barry got it right except what many have pointed out, the greed and avarice factor.  Fannie and Freddie did not force the ratings agencies to rate them AAA nor did they force the appraisers to continually jack up the appraisals.  How can we solve these issues , if you and your like keep dodging the issues?  I realize that with all of the damage it must be hard to have voted for Bush, but geeeeeeez.</p>

			<p>I agree with the analysis, but there is absolutely no reason to excuse Fannie/Freddie, the CRA and the credit rating cartel (NRSROs) during this entire mess.</p>
<p>The regulation was certainly there, and it failed.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett has a remarkable quote, about the OHFEO who were established in 1992 to do one thing &#8211; oversee Fannie and Freddie. They had 200 staff and $65m budget, and they never sounded the alarm bell over Fannie and Freddie except in 2004 over the accounting standards scandal. But clearly these guys couldnt do their job.</p>

<p>This theft was engineered to further consolidate wealth and power. There were no accidents or neglect in oversight. All programs and rules were changed to facilitate the objective.

<p>It took 3 or more administrations to implement enough change to  be able to extended credit to drones. Their ability to pay meaningless, the signiture capture creating a tradable document was more than sufficient to extract the repayment from those who could pay, the savers the tax base.</p>
<p>So either both parties were too stupid to see the trend or complicit in the implementation. After all who&#8217;s going to jail, anyone lose any benies, parachutes, whatever, after they collapsed their brick and morters, as directed.</p>

			<p>&#8220;To repeat my prior arguments, the proximate cause of the Housing crisis were 1) Ultra-low rates; and 2) Abdication of traditional lending standards, thanks to 3) originators ability to resell mortgages for securitization purposes, and hence, 4) not have to worry about loan defaults.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fannie/Freddie/CRA/Politicians are all part of the web that created the mess, including of course ultra low rates that provided the almost endless fuel. It&#8217;s baffling why you say Fannie/Freddie/CRA are NOT to blame when it is clear by your ennumeration, they lie at the heart of the crisis.  Without the GSE/CRA to purchase/certify the bogus mortgages, #2 through #4 could not have occured.</p>
<p>[<b>BR</b>: As I have said, Freddie and Fannie were cogs in this machine. But understand this fact: The subprime loans were being made and securitized for many years before Fannie/Freddie were allowed to purchase subprime]</p>
<p>&#8220;The credit crisis was caused by 1) the above securitized mortgage paper, that was 2) rated triple AAA by Moody&#8217;s and Standard &amp; Poors, which then 3) Which was then &#8220;insured&#8221; by credit default swaps (CDS) &#8212; the unreserved for, shadow insurance products 4) whose exemption was made possible by the Commodities Futures Modernization Act. That legislation exempted these derivatives from any supervision or regulation. The lack of reserve requirements is why there is now $62 trillion in CDS, many of which will never pay their counter parties the promised insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, all this point directly to the CRAs and GSEs (quasi gov&#8217;t entities or gov&#8217;t sponsored monopolies).</p>
<p>[<b>BR</b>: The CRA has nothing whatsoever to do with derivatives.]</p>
<p>In regards to #3 and #4, the problem wasn&#8217;t a lack of regulation.  The problem was that an entity like AIG was &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; (just like Citi, Goldman, Wells, BofA).</p>
<p>But why are these financial firms too big to fail? How could something like this happen in a free marketplace?  It couldn&#8217;t! The reason why these financial firms became too big to fail is BECAUSE of gov&#8217;t regulation to protect them and/or the public and thus by restricting competition and/or through implicit backstops, these giant, too-big-to-fail entities become created.  In a free-market, no private company would be allowed to become too-big-to-fail. Giant monstrosities like AIG, Citi, BofA can only be created in a regulated market environment where free-competition is stifled by gov&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It is not a sin to fail. Companies and CEOs make mistakes all the time and should be expected to make mistakes. That&#8217;s how the market works. No one is omniscient. But when a firm becomes too-big-to-fail because of gov&#8217;t regulation/interference in the market, then we get a situation where a CEO makes a mistake and their mistake can take down the whole system.</p>
<p>But socialists/interventionists will point to this and say, &#8220;see, the free-market has failed. We have to regulate and make sure these firms CANNOT fail&#8221;.  Then through gov&#8217;t support, regulation, backstops, these firms become larger and larger and when they make their next mistake sometime down the road, the next failure is even bigger than the last and becomes an ever great threat to the whole system.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a vicious cycle towards greater socialism/interventionism in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The answer is to remove all regulation and allow firms to fail and thus allow no firm to become so big that they are &#8220;too-big-to-fail&#8221;.</p>
<p>Simply allow the free-market to work the way it&#8217;s supposed to. And when a firm fails, let the chips fall where they may. Don&#8217;t support it, backstop it, or regulate it. By doing so, you only stifle competition, create giant monsters, and make their next failure even more catastrophic.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p><b>BR</b>: As to your last points, we are fairly close in our views . . .</p>

			<p>If the shadow banking system was to be allowed to lever in excess of 30/1, the monetary base would have needed to expand at a rate proportional to support, the rise in asset values such an expansion produces, think affordability. As such wage inflation would occur maintaining some state of equilibrium. This extension of credit without a concurrent expansion of the monetary base which by the way is being attempted now after the fact, was a known one way ticket to a catasphic failure, requiring the very consolidations it has purposefully wrought.</p>

<p>Requiem,</p>
<p>In 2004, Mr. Raines gave us one of the earlier accounting scandals. Forgive me, I have lost count of these scandals.</p>
<p>Per Fortune magazine (jan 2005):</p>
<p>&#8220;On Sept. 22, 2004, OFHEO released results of its continuing investigation. The &#8220;Special Examination of Fannie Mae&#8221; was a dense 211 pages packed with technical accounting details. But the message was clear: OFHEO accused Fannie Mae of both willfully breaking accounting rules and fostering an environment of &#8220;weak or nonexistent&#8221; internal controls.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more to government than finance/economy, and the differences between the parties are glaring when it comes to most government functions.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t see the difference between the past 8 years, and the 8 that came before them, you can&#8217;t see anything.</p>
<p>No one called us torturers back then. We had never illegally invaded another sovereign nation, and government spending (the &#8220;other&#8221; finance) while excessive, was still manageable.</p>
<p>We knew that the office of VP was in the Executive branch, our Constitution had not been violated and/or derided as &#8220;quaint&#8221; by any responsible politician, and padded contracts to cronies would have sent one to jail. Habeas Corpus was the law of the land by statute and precedent.</p>
<p>Congress had never been convened to save a brain-dead woman from the opposition who, if you were dumb enough to believe the ruling party, were hell bent on killing her. Stem cell research would have been funded, science would have remained more than a matter of opinion. The religious right &#8211; in all of it&#8217;s glorious self-delusion, hypocrisy and incompetence &#8211; would not now make up part of our essential (career) bureaucracy.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a huge difference between the parties.</p>

			<p>Lenders/agents were also at fault. When I worked at the bank, there used to be ghetto high school kids that worked at lending agencies. These kids would come into the bank with $4k weekly/bi-weekly checks, which were from closing deals. They were not professionals at all and probably gave loans away just to get fatter paychecks. I was even asked whether I wanted to work there, but I passed. I knew something shady was going on.</p>

<p>No doubt, but if you are going to extend such credit in &#8220;good faith&#8221; and you expanded the monetary base to accommadate,a collapse could more reasonably be accepted as an accident. The expansion such as the one being attempted could at least be construed as to the public benefit. The housing expansion reeks of &#8220;the first by inflation,then by deflation&#8221; ploy as the monetary aggregate was insufficient to provide for debt service. Of course the attempted fix is likely to create ITulips KaPoom. as your tail chasing post illustrates.</p>
<p>So I quess we get inflation followed by deflation ending in hyperinflation. Remains to be seen but not pretty.</p>

<p>You give them too much credit&#8230;.originators were/are  selling the products the securitizers were asking for, plain and simple.</p>
<p>If a loan program is offered that will be purchased by a Wall Street investor that allows people with 580 credit scores and only 1 day removed from the discharge of a chapter 7 bankruptcy (yes it was that lenient starting in 2007), then the originator has an ethical obligation to tell the inquiring borrower that they do in fact qualify under the criteria set by the investor.</p>
<p>A Honda motorcycle saleman knows that the 18 year old who buys the new crotch-rocket with 300hps will likely kill himself, but that doesn&#8217;t make him morally responsible when the kid dies.</p>
<p>No difference.</p>

<p>The Treasury demand will quickly hit a wall of distrust as lenders realize that the money lent to the U.S. is being used to purchase debt that is unlikely to be repaid in full &#8211; we are  no longer talking about simply recession but collapse of trust in fiat currency and with it the government&#8217;s ability to fund itself.</p>

<p>Also I&#8217;m not clear on this but didn&#8217;t the bill include some new way of paying interest to the FED, allowing the stealthy expansion of the money supply, to supplement flooding the market with Treasury debt. As I said not clear on this maybe you have a much better understanding.</p>

<p>This is probably an article that the New York Times and Barry wishe it didn’t have in its archives because it reveals the true culprits behind the current Fannie Mae meltdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;NYT 1999: Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending<br />
The New York Times | 1999 | By STEVEN A. HOLMES</p>
<p>In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.</p>
<p>The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets &#8212; including the New York metropolitan region &#8212; will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE7DB153EF933A0575AC0A96F958260">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE7DB153EF933A0575AC0A96F958260</a></p>
<p>~~~~<br />
<b>BR</b>:  Yes, that was it ! A pilot progran with 24 banks is the root cause of 4 trillion dollars worth of losses.</p>
<p>How about this, Marek &#8212; why don&#8217;t you do some homework and find out exactly what the total number of homes were in the program, how much was loaned out, what the default and foreclosure rate was for this.</p>
<p>Or do you prefer just mindlessly repeating wingnut  talking points?</p>

			<p>Stormrunner,</p>
<p>This is above and beyond the $700B Paulson Plan.  The changes are occuring so fast and furious that it is difficult to keep pace.  Bottom line is that the demand from the Treasury is intense.  Try to keep an eye on Treasury demand &#8211; that is the method so far being used to finance all these actions.  The long end bond will give an indication of resistance.  If the Treasury demand cannot be sold, there is no choice but to monetize, which would drive the dollar into collapse.</p>
<p>It appears the central bankers have lost control.</p>

			<p>Google is celebrating their 10th anniversary. For a limited time you can search from the year 2001. I urge everyone to search &#8220;Doug Noland&#8221; and read the first article that comes up, it&#8217;s from October 2001. Doug Noland predicted everything that is happening now, he nailed it!</p>
<p>He mentioned in the article that the bad policies started three years ago, which would have been 1998. So it&#8217;s unfair to blame Bush. This traces back to the Clinton administration. But more than any politician, the Fed is to blame. This was the house that Greenspan built.</p>

<p>I have to agree with Stormrunner that we are ruled under a uni-party system.</p>
<p>Your objections are mine also, but these are the result of a small percentage of like-minded individuals &#8211; the neo-conservatives &#8211; being elevated to positions of power.  Without a true opposition party, and lacking a aggressive free press, it only takes a handful of co-conspirators in powerful positions to alter the course of the entire beaurocracy.</p>
<p>What has occured in the last 8 years has more in keeping with a coup de etat than party affiliation.</p>
<p>Remember, the Democratic brotherhood went along with the Patriot Act, The Military Commissions Act, The John Warner Defense Act, etc., etc.</p>

			<p>One of the things missing in this thread is slo mo &#8216;flippers&#8217; seeking capital gains with no taxes.</p>
<p>When I dealt my first coupla residential RE transactions, I traveled around a lot as a military guy we had to keep track of our &#8220;gains&#8221; because there was a life time capital gains exclusion limit.  Sometime after 1990, maybe some one here can link, the tax became $500K per married couple per transaction as long as minimum occupancy, 2 years was met.</p>
<p>No more life time limit to the gains exclusion.</p>
<p>The residential housing market became a limitless, tax free, appreciating, cash machine.</p>
<p>Never going down&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>Maybe some tax raising democrat did that!!</p>

			<p>&#8220;As I have said, Freddie and Fannie were cogs in this machine. But understand this fact: The subprime loans were being made and securitized for many years before Fannie/Freddie were allowed to purchase subprime&#8221;</p>
<p>True, so how were subprime loans sold off prior to Fannie/Freddie? Through the workings of the CRAs! These quasi gov&#8217;t monopolies/agencies slapped triple-A ratings on subprime loans/packages and institutions who by law were told that they must purchase debt with triple-A ratings by S&amp;P/Moody&#8217;s bought them up without the need to do their own due diligence. They simply followed the regulatory laws which meant without question BELIEVING what the CRAs said.  Again, gov&#8217;t regulation/meddling lies at the root of this problem. Absent gov&#8217;t meddling/regulation, no free agent would blindly take for granted the OPINION of a rating agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CRA has nothing whatsoever to do with derivatives&#8221;</p>
<p>CRAs may not have been involved with CDS, but they were certainly involved with derivatives, ie, mortgages that were sliced/diced into various packages and sold off as CDos or some other alphabet soup package.</p>

			<p>Isn&#8217;t it time to move beyond the balme game and really focus on the necessary regulatory changes necessary:</p>
<p>1. No more off-balance sheet B/S (SIV&#8217;s, Conduits etc.) I thought we had already learnt this lesson with Enron?</p>
<p>2. Get Derivatives onto an Exchange such that all have a market value.</p>
<p>3. Revised leverage limits.</p>
<p>4. New oversight of Ratings Agencies. The inherent conflicts of interest must be removed, both externally (I get paid for giving a higher rating by the Organisation I give it to)  and Internally (I get paid twice if I can not only give an inflated rating but also get consulting fees for advising how to abuse the system)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see and sense of Urgency to address these critical issues and all we get is more obfuscation such as banning short selling and &#8220;Temporary&#8221; changes to Fair Value accounting regulations ( How does that help restore trust between Banks?Forbes at least should know better?!)</p>
<p>Can we just get this thing fixed once and for all so we can move on and not have it drag on forever, like in Japan.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been telling this story for a while to a few friends, so was glad to see this and sent the link to the group.  What&#8217;s missing here are the people on the ground who are of no political party.  All of the minions who put these mortgages into the hands of the willing dupes.  Underwriting a mortgage loan isn&#8217;t rocket science.  Person-to-person.  What&#8217;s your job or income stream.  Other bills.  All the other THIRD GRADE addition and subtraction.  People just didn&#8217;t do it.  You don&#8217;t create this Potemkin Village of derivative paper without everyone shirking responsibilty on a massive scale.  Few people can even contemplate what is a trillion.  A FREAKIN&#8217; TRILLION.  SIXTY-TWO TRILLION fabricated dollars.  It&#8217;s all very sad.  This is not the finest hour for the United States of America.</p>

			<p>I am not sure as to why you are doing this. I guess you are a democrat promoting your political agenda, or maybe you were brainwashed by Prof. Roubini (he was a part of Clinton’s Administration during that time) or simply you are ill informed.</p>
<p>If you really want an honest discussion without any political bias, lets do it:</p>
<p>1.	Your statement about $4 trillion worth of losses is inaccurate and misleading (that would be roughly 35% percent of all mortgages and you know well that 90% of all mortgages are paid on time money good paper).</p>
<p>2.	In addition, you know well that this pilot program has become a wide spread practice “by next spring” as Clinton Administration wanted (read the entire article)</p>
<p>3.	Moreover, you also know well about a Harvard study that conclusively showed, “accounting for nearly two-thirds of household growth in 1995 to 2005, minorities contributed 49 percent of the 12.5 million rise in homeowners over the decade.” . . . “Without the sudden expansion of sub-prime lending, most of these homeowners would have been denied access to credit.”… “Sub-prime growth from $210 billion in 2001 to $625 billion in 2005.” In addition, the same study reported that sub-prime instruments like ARMs took off in the 90s during Clinton Administration and that in 2004 high-income minority communities (more than 50% minority) had about 19% of all mortgages as high-cost mortgages compared to 7% for predominantly white.</p>
<p>The evidence is clear that Clinton’s Administration is responsible for initiating this expensive social engineering  mess and Clinton should be added  to your list as a number one culprit (others are also responsible for profiting from it but it was Clinton’s idea so please do not deny him the credit that he deserves)</p>

			<p>Marek,</p>
<p>When did house prices take off with double-digit gains every year?  Not until the Republican Congress repealed Glass-Steagal and Jr. took over.  As for Clinton, he signed the Glass-Steagall repeal even though his party voted against it.  So, he&#8217;s &#8220;yours&#8221;.  All yours.</p>
<p>Mark E. Hoffer,</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably right.  But, imagine this.  Let&#8217;s say you were president in 2001 and &#8212; let&#8217;s just say &#8212; decided you were too chicken to implement your ideas.  At least, not right away or without a massive PR campaign to make people understand your POV.  In other words, &#8220;life goes on&#8221; while you plan your long-term strategies.  Do you take a hands-off approach to the developing bubble and reports of fraud?  Or do you enforce the rules currently on the books?</p>
<p>You see, even though I wish governments would exit the housing market, if I were Prez I&#8217;d still stay on top of the present situation.  (I&#8217;d hire people with an interest in regulating.)  If I ignored appraisal fraud, approved increased leverage, and ignored obvious froth, I would consider myself grossly negligent for what happened.</p>
<p>I would be greatly pained were I to fail in my job as a regulator.  If I hold myself to that standard, I certainly hold Jr. to that standard.</p>
<p>Until your ideas are implemented, the health of the economy depends on good regulators, regulators who don&#8217;t set up a fox raid on the hen house.</p>

			<p>I agree with Tony Fleming&#8217;s point.  This was &#8212; most importantly &#8212; fraud on a massive scale.  Where was the SEC or other agencies?  Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.  I recall reading years ago that the SEC budget was cut either during the same year as Enron or the very next.  We expand our military budget to defend our physical security but we don&#8217;t want to protect our crown jewels (our capital markets on which our quality of life in-no-small-part depends)??  How friggin stupid is that!</p>

			<p>Not to mention that it&#8217;s really pathetic blaming a prior administration last in office 6 years before the bust and who worked with the Republicans to deregulate.  If there was any kind of problem developing from 2001 thru 2006 leading to a bust in 2007 and 2008, you&#8217;d have to be a complete tool to pass the buck.</p>
<p>To anyone from the self-proclaimed party of self-responsibility who would dare try to pass the buck, I say &#8220;please GFY&#8221;.  Take responsibility, asshat.  You had power.  You should have used it.  But, why???  I&#8217;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>Winston Munn once said &#8220;all you have to do to convince Congress to support the bailout is tell the Dems it&#8217;s to keep people in their homes and tell the Reps it&#8217;s to keep businesses running&#8221;.  Well, why do you think Democrat socialist housing programs not only continued after 2000 but were expanded so heinously under Jr and Republican rule?  Because businesses wanted it!  The foxes cozy up to the regulators.</p>
<p>Same thing with illegal immigration.  The Republican base hates it.  The Republican leadership pays lip service, despite having the power to pass legislation from 2001-2006.  Why?  Because businesses like paying lower wages.  So, instead of dealing with that, we had national conversations about Terry Schaivo and gay marriage.</p>
<p>Un frigging believable.</p>

			<p>BR &#8211; With all due respect, you are missing the 2/3 of the picture. You are focusing entirely on the mechanics on Wall Street. No doubt they screwed up big time. But you can&#8217;t ignore 2 other pieces:</p>
<p>1) Main street: greed, corruption, and/or stupidity by borrowers (not just the poor, but condo flippers, etc), appraisers (a CA condo we struggled to get appraised for $175K in 1998 sold for $536K in 2005 (a 17% CAGR); how could any appraiser justify that?) and mortgage brokers. We wouldn&#8217;t be in such a huge hole without vastly overpriced homes and unprecedented numbers of foreclosures.</p>
<p>2) The political environment &amp; politicians that facilitated the legislative and regulatory changes that permitted/encouraged many of the Wall Street excesses. While the GOP&#8217;s laissez-faire ideology played a part, the push (largely by Dems, but also by Bush) to increase home ownership was also huge.</p>
<p>Witness the following quote from HUD&#8217;s 1994 &#8220;National Home Ownership Strategy&#8221;:<br />
&#8220;For many potential homebuyers, the lack of cash available to accumulate the required downpayment and closing costs is the major impediment to purchasing a home. Other households do not have sufficient available income to to make the monthly payments on mortgages financed at market interest rates for standard loan terms. Financing strategies, fueled by the creativity and resources of the private and public sectors, should address both of these financial barriers to homeownership.&#8221;<br />

			<p>No use of blaming poor George Bush. He just inherited a mortgage backed housing system from the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>Here are excerpts from a 1999 article in New York Times :<br />
&#8220;Fannie Mae, the nation’s biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.&#8221;</p>

			<p>to add to justobserving&#8217;s &amp; Marek&#8217;s points, its widely known that the CRA requires banks to meet the credit needs of low &amp; moderate income communities in exchange for FDIC coverage and other subsidies.</p>
<p>non-compliance with the CRA does not result in fines, rather, when banks apply to expand, merge with or acquire another bank, or open a branch, citizens may challenge an application and request that it be denied based on the bank&#8217;s poor lending performance in minority or low and moderate income communities.</p>
<p>it started slowly after it was passed and gained real traction as we entered the 90&#8242;s during which there were key legislative (1989 FIRREA ) and regulatory changes made (1993 revised regulations, 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) as well as the impact of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 which repealed inter-state banking restictions and named CRA ratings as a major consideration when deciding whether to allow interstate branches,  and as mentioned in the following speech</p>
<p><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/Bernanke20070330a.htm">http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/Bernanke20070330a.htm</a></p>
<p>given by our beloved uncle ben, a surge in bank merger and acquisition activities followed the passing of the act, and advocacy groups increasingly used the public comment process to protest bank applications on CRA grounds.<br />
when applications were highly contested, federal agencies overseeing banking regulations held public hearings to allow public comment on the bank&#8217;s lending record.  public hearings i say! public hearings are something banks will avoid if given the choice.</p>
<p>let&#8217;s not pretend that these aren&#8217;t examples of, to a degree, &#8220;forcing&#8221; banks to lend to those they shouldn&#8217;t or perhaps to those they shouldn&#8217;t want to. how much this contributed to our current situation is unknown.<br />
by the time we get to the 2000&#8242;s we didn&#8217;t need the CRA, it was irrelevant. the game changed and there were no more lending standards because guess what? not only did banks comply, but it turned out to be a really good idea! (lending to those that can&#8217;t afford it) until now, but it doesn&#8217;t look like low income &amp; moderate income communities are going to be getting anymore loans anytime soon. let&#8217;s not be so quick to dismiss the fact that  banks were and will certainly be again, forced to loan funds to those who can&#8217;t afford to pay them back.</p>
<p>so i suppose the answer is no BR, no rule or piece of legislation exists that requires lenders to abandon standards but since when did rules and legislation dictate conduct in the land of the free market?</p>

			<p>Consider this:<br />
How did we get securitization?<br />
Mike Rappaport</p>
<p>Arnold Kling explains how we got to a world with mortgage securitization.  While some people believe that it simply involved modern financial techniques applied to mortgages, Kling (who used to work for Freddie Mac) explains it as a regulatory story.  This is all part of Kling&#8217;s explanation for how we got from a world where we had 30 year fixed rate mortgages with significant downpayments (Method A) to one where we had variable rate mortages with no downpayments (Method B).  Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p>In the early 1980&#8242;s, the savings and loan industry was imploding. The savings and loans held many mortgages that had lost value, due to inflation and high interest rates. Under the accounting rules prevailing at the time, they could record the mortgages at their original book values&#8211;as long as they did not sell them. The S&amp;L&#8217;s were stuck. If they did not sell mortgages, they would lack the cash to pay depositors. If they did sell mortgages, they would have to recognize losses, and regulators would shut them down.</p>
<p>The solution was a program called Guarantor at Freddie Mac and Swap at Fannie Mae. Under this program,, an S&amp;L paid Fannie or Freddie a fee to pool loans into securities, which were retained by the S&amp;L. The S&amp;L could then use the securities as collateral to obtain loans. The key to the whole operation was an accounting ruling that allowed the S&amp;L&#8217;s to maintain the fictional book values of the mortgages held as securities,, even though lenders were using much lower market values when providing the collateralized loans to the S&amp;L&#8217;s. This accounting ruling came from fierce lobbying by Wall Street, which wanted to broker the loans to the S&amp;L&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Wall Street extracted large fees from this program. Ultimately, most of the S&amp;L&#8217;s failed, with losses borne by taxpayers. The Guarantor and Swap programs increased the cost, both directly by transferring wealth out of the S&amp;L&#8217;s and indirectly by allowing defunct S&amp;L&#8217;s to remain in business and continue gambling with other people&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>Following the demise of the S&amp;L&#8217;s, regulators established capital requirements and other rules that made Method A lending very expensive relative to Method B lending. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were given freedom to leverage their guarantee at much higher ratios of assets to capital than were Method A lenders. In fact, the capital regulations even told banks that holding private mortgage securities under Method B was less risky and therefore required less capital than Method A lending. The result was that Method B came to dominate the American mortgage market. Had the playing field been level, Method A would have remained in place, and Method B likely would never have gotten started.</p>
<p>The regulations that favored Method B were heavily influenced by the lobbying activities of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Wall Street investment bankers. The secondary mortgage market lobby made large campaign contributions to key legislators. Their influence tilted regulations to favor Method B. Thanks to the regulatory advantages given to Method B, Freddie, Fannie, and the investment banks earned large profits. It was a triangular trade: contributions for favors for profits.</p>
<p>I have not heard this explanation before.  This financial crisis has so many aspects, and is so complicated, that unfortunately it will take a long time to understand even the basics of it.  But it is important to recognize that it involves complicated interactions between regulatory structures and private responses to them.</p>

			<p>Gee, when has securitization of mortgages and overleverage led to a bust before?  The 1920&#8242;s-1930&#8242;s.  Was there a CRA then?  No.</p>
<p>Look at the chart of debt today versus the 1920&#8242;s.  That&#8217;s what this crisis is all about.</p>
<p>People, use your common sense.  The CRA is an excuse, a distraction.  It&#8217;s being used for political purposes to deflect blame from the Republican party.</p>
<p>If you &#8220;CRA&#8221;-chanting wingnuts are in need of a distraction, stay tuned to Fox News (or, really, any MSM TV channel) and be on the lookout for the next report of another missing white girl.  (If not today, then wait and you&#8217;ll be rewarded.)  It&#8217;ll be right after the next commercial.  Stay tuned.</p>

			<p>Zombie wingnut lies never die, do they?</p>
<p>Ok, just for the record&#8230;</p>
<p>1) The CRA only applied to community banks. Most of the banks making home loans fell outside of those rules: 60% of the subprime loans originate totally outside of the regulation, and another 20% orginated out of satellite banking entites which only had voluntary reporting requirements.</p>
<p>2) Loans that were reported as CRA compliant have much lower default rates than non-CRA loans, because the banks originating them were generally smaller local banks that were working from solid business models instead of just trying to get another quick commission fee.</p>
<p>3) Nothing in the CRA says you have to make stupid loans, only that local banks can&#8217;t screw poor people out of houses. In a lot of communities the monthly payment for a starter house is no higher than the monthly payment for an apartment, so a lot of people can afford the payments even if they could never save for a 15% downpayment.</p>
<p>4) Nothing in the CRA says banks should sell off loans to other banks and investment houses over and over again until the original $150K loan is the foundation for $5 million dollars in CDO&#8217;s and CDS&#8217;s.</p>
<p>5) Mortgage brokers lied about the terms and likely cost increases in ARM&#8217;s with alarming frequency. They then lied about the quality of the loans when selling them to other banks. The CRA had nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>6) Many of the crappy ARM&#8217;s loans went to wealthy white real estate &#8220;investors&#8221; looking to get a 4% interest rate while they flipped a house in a middle or upper class neighborhood in 2-6 months. The CRA had nothing to do with that either.</p>

<p>&#8220;Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Monday that Americans&#8217; preference for long-term, fixed-rate mortgages means many are paying more than necessary for their homes and suggested consumers would benefit if lenders offered more alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>lenders then provided teasers even lower than the ridiculously low short-term rates Alan set at the time &#8230; and Alan then belatedly raised rates.</p>

			<p>I think the main reason we have this mess is one thing. wages have been collapsing for years. the financial wizards helped create that. they also tried to cover it up by using financial wizardry by creating easy credit.  and that was papering over the collapse of wages. until last year when the wizards discovered they had no clothes. and house prices started to collapse because they had gotten so out of synche with wages. and we know that wages are going to continue their free fall. so guess where house prices are going? i remember hearing that deflation was as big an issue as inflation, wonder why?&gt;</p>

			<p>While it&#8217;s obvious that there is blame to go around, one thing that I&#8217;ve yet to hear discussed is the influence Fannie/Freddie had through lobbying due to their status as for-profit corporations. When Fannie/Freddie became for-profit corporations with a restricted business model, that is, business based only on buying up mortgages, their primary responsibility became shareholder value and not the economy or the housing market or anything else. A company like GE can grow into other businesses, markets, etc. but Fannie/Freddie could only increase their shareholder value by having more mortgages to buy up. This then puts pressure on the companies officers to lobby Washington to allow ever more creative means of easing lending practices. Without this lobbying push they had no other way to &#8220;grow&#8221; their business.</p>
<p>So I think that part of the problem &#8220;stems&#8221; from the for-profit nature of Fannie/Freddie with a restricted and regulated business model. This seems to me to be the recipe for bubble creation because it doesn&#8217;t allow them to grow their company in any other direction but the one the regulators have set for it. Maybe they shouldn&#8217;t have existed, I don&#8217;t know, but I do think they shouldn&#8217;t have existed as this kind of corporate model.</p>
<p>I also think that&#8217;s how members of Congress have some dirt on their hands because they allowed Fannie/Freddie lobbying to influence them. Fannie/Freddie were lobbying for their own selfish interest, which is what a for-profit corporation does and is legally supposed to do.</p>
<p>I initially started thinking along these lines after reading a 1999 NYTimes article, &#8220;Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending&#8221; which said this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fannie Mae, the nation&#8217;s biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9c0de7db153ef933a0575ac0a96f958260&#038;sec=&#038;spon=&#038;&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=Fannie%20Mae%20Eases%20Credit%20To%20Aid%20Mortgage%20Lending&#038;st=cse">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9c0de7db153ef933a0575ac0a96f958260&#038;sec=&#038;spon=&#038;&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=Fannie%20Mae%20Eases%20Credit%20To%20Aid%20Mortgage%20Lending&#038;st=cse</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t find a government policy of trying to get more people into home ownership a problem, but I think Fannie/Freddie as there were setup helped fuel the bubble.</p>

Most of the banks making home loans fell outside of those rules: 60% of the subprime loans originate totally outside of the regulation, and another 20% orginated out of satellite banking entites which only had voluntary reporting requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>survey says?  XXX</p>
<p>The CRA applies to all federally insured lenders. ie: all FDIC members.</p>
<p>The mantra that the CRA doesn&#8217;t force lenders to make poor or risky loans, etc. is laughable if you understand how banks operate.  Banks are the ultime growth business, eat or be eaten more so than any other operation.  After all, to quote Willie Sutton, &#8220;that&#8217;s where the money is&#8221;.<br />
Or is it?</p>
<p>The CRA language doesn&#8217;t force anyone to do anyting,  but when banks apply to expand, merge with or acquire another bank, or open a branch, citizens can challenge an application and request that it be denied based on the bank&#8217;s CRA rating.</p>
<p>So no it doesn&#8217;t dictate poor lending practices but if banks want to do what banks do &#8211; expand, merge, acquire, open branches, they better make sure they have one of the top two CRA ratings or they will have community activists blocking and screaming which brings headlines which banks can&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>If low income communities had applicants that qualified for loans, said applicants would get loans without federal intervention.  Since many do not, and since  banks need that rating they start compromizing standards.</p>
<p>So what to do now that you have your ratings in exchange for future losses.  Get these pieces of poop off the books.  The same thing they did with all of the sub-prime loans floated in the past 5 years during which time the CRA was no longer needed.  Don&#8217;t be so quick to dismiss everything to political jockeying because your boys on CNBC or wherever have you brainwashed.</p>
<p>AMERICA IS BRAINWASHED</p>

			<p>Barry &#8211; I&#8217;m still not sure you&#8217;re at the root cause. The ultimate cause is that human beings want things that are above and beyond their basic needs. The low rates, etc. is the &#8220;lighter fuel&#8221; or enabler to their basic wants. Just as markets don&#8217;t buy, people buy, low rates enable me to better fulfill my wants &#8211; both proximate and distal. We live in a country where the average credit card balance is &gt;$7K (give or take) and the average savings rate is basically zero (negative for a time last year). The umbrella of securitization and super low rates is fuel to those consumerism wants. I don&#8217;t look at this through the dualistic lens of political party &#8211; the equation here has many components that cuts across parties and administrations.
