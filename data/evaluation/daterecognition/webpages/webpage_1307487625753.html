	    <p>On the dot of 7pm families and strangers took each other's hands and stepped into the main road, some carrying flags, others with lapel badges showing the swastika beside the hammer and sickle. Organisers claimed a million and a half were taking part, but from where I stood in a Lithuanian field on a sunlit evening 20 years ago this Sunday, the mood was as impressive as the numbers.</p><p>Defiance and solidarity were uppermost, as well as delight that so many people had turned out. Most were on their first political demonstration. Public protests were springing up all over the Soviet Union and its eastern European empire in 1989, but in one swoop <a href="http://www.balticway.net/" title="the Baltic Way">the Baltic Way</a>, as the vast human chain was called, had trumped the others by its size and quiet dignity.</p><p>It stretched from the Estonian capital Tallinn via Riga in Latvia to Lithuania's Vilnius. The aim was to denounce an event exactly half a century earlier, the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/230972/German-Soviet-Nonaggression-Pact" title="Molotov-Ribbentrop pact">Molotov-Ribbentrop pact</a>, in which Hitler and Stalin publicly agreed not to attack each other, while adding secret clauses that carved up central Europe, paving the way for the Nazis to move into western Poland while Stalin took most of the Baltic states, eastern Poland, and parts of Romania.</p><p>The human chain was primarily intended to show Moscow and the world the strength of the Baltic independence drive. But it was also a protest over the suppression of history. The Soviet authorities were still denying the secret clauses' existence, although they had been discovered by western forces in Berlin in 1945 and were widely known.</p><p>Soon after the Baltic Way <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/238982/Mikhail-Gorbachev" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, the reforming Soviet leader, conceded the point and published the Soviet version. Yet, 20 years on, the issue is still a political football, marked by a resolution which the European parliament passed this spring to declare 23 August "a Europe-wide Remembrance Day for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes".</p><p>In the arcane way these things are done in the European parliament, the resolution was a watered-down version of a "declaration" it passed last September which wanted to make 23&nbsp;August a day to remember "victims of Stalinism and Nazism". Individual EU governments take the ultimate decision, and few have nominated 23 August as a special day. But the issue matters as it marks an unpleasant effort by many Baltic and central European politicians to equate Stalinism and Nazism or claim Stalinism was worse. In part concerned by the continuing strength of former Communist parties in the region, they use the Nazi-Soviet "equation" as a device to smear any party of the left. (The draft resolution was watered down by left groups in the European parliament.) It is also a barely disguised attempt to maintain extreme wariness, if not outright hostility, to contemporary Russia.</p><p>The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact certainly showed Stalin to be as cynical as Hitler. But to jump from that to equate the two men's record or ideology does not accord with reality. Nor does it take account of the fact that Soviet policy evolved after Stalin's death so that political activity, let alone ordinary family life, in the two decades under Brezhnev was not subject to arbitrary terror. Rightwing Baltic politicians have a point in saying most other Europeans are unaware of Stalin's mass deportations from the Baltics. Perhaps 100,000 people were sent to Siberia after 1939 or when the Red Army defeated the Nazis and re-entered the region. But to believe that western Europeans did not know about the Gulag ignores the massive influence of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2276650.stm" title="Alexander Solzhenitsyn">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> after his books were translated into every European language in the 1970s.</p><p>There is always more to learn, and historians are always trying to re-interpret. One of the biggest areas which remains to be explored is the extent of local civilian participation in the Nazis' central European killing fields. In <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521720250" title="The Continuities of German History">The Continuities of German History</a>, the American historian Helmut Walser Smith recently pointed out that the Auschwitz-based image of the Holocaust as faceless, conveyor-belt, industrial murder is distorted. Most Jews died in archaic and primitive ways, shot at close range on the edge of pits and trenches, or gassed from exhaust pipes. These massacres were witnessed, shared in, or known about by huge numbers of local people as well as of Germans.</p><p>In recent issues of the New York Review of Books another US historian, Tim Snyder, made similar points while summing up the latest scholarship on Hitler's and Stalin's killing. "By the end of 1941 the Germans (along with local auxiliaries and Romanian troops) had killed a million Jews in the Soviet Union and the Baltics. That is the equivalent of the total number of Jews killed at Auschwitz during the entire war," he wrote. When it comes to numbers, Hitler's record is dominant. He killed almost twice as many people as Stalin. Snyder lists the number of European Jews murdered under German auspices at 5.7 million, German starvation of Soviet citizens at about 4 million and mass reprisal killings against civilians, mainly for actual or suspected partisan activity, as at least 750,000. Stalin killed about 5.5 million Soviet citizens by starvation and had about 700,000 people shot in the prewar Great Terror.</p><p></p><p>There is a difference between memory and history, Snyder's first essay concluded – a point which he had to concede against himself later when a reader pointed out his failure to mention Hitler's murder of Roma, proportionately almost as massive as that of Europe's Jews. The issue could be repeated in connection with <a href="http://www.wajda.pl/" title="Andrzej Wajda">Andrzej Wajda</a>'s film about Katyn, now being shown in Britain, and the way Poles were forced for decades to censor themselves. But, important though it is to be reminded how the Soviet authorities (until 1989) blamed their 1940 massacre of imprisoned Polish officers on the Nazis, one should not forget that in Operation Tannenberg the Nazis killed a comparable number of Polish intellectuals a few months earlier.</p><p>Is there a moral? The Baltic Way's commemoration of Molotov-Ribbentrop sent a particular message in August 1989 by breaking a 50-year taboo and expressing a widespread demand for independence. But what was right in one part of Europe at a special moment should not be extended across the continent for ever. History is too complex and sensitive to be left to politicians. First they manipulate anniversaries, then they move to textbooks, and the slide gathers speed.</p>

							<p>Hmm.. by admitting both the Germans and Soviets killed hundreds of Polish societal leaders you yourself draw the comparison.</p><p>The only difference between the two regimes was Soviet Russia had no Final solution towards a particular racial group it hated.</p><p>It was equally brutal against those it disliked though, and there is some evidence it used famine as a weapon of political control in Ukraine. Certainly the Ukrainains think so.</p><p>To be honest, I can see very little to distinguish the two. That Hitler killed twice as many people as Stalin (debateable btw) possibly merely shows greater organisation than intent.</p><p>And of course, Stalinism as a political system has killed people outside of the Svoiet Union as it, unlike Nazism, was exported elsewhere.</p>

							<p>I imagine this subject can only be addressed casually in a newspaper that regularly deletes politically inconvenient comments. However, the evidence is that Stalin killed many more Russians than Hitler did anyone else put together. The left's atrocities - from involvement in instigating WW1 to Communism and all its lies and horrors - are regularly washed over with the excuse that it 'wasn't 'real' communism what did it - only an interpretation'.</p><p>Quite simply the left refuses to accept the consequences of their ideologies put into practice. On the contrary Nazism doesn't exist today, but another struggle does which is regularly tarred with that brush - and that is European survival in a century when their civilisation could possibly be wiped out of history.</p>

							<p><i>an unpleasant effort by many Baltic and central European politicians to equate Stalinism and Nazism or claim Stalinism was worse.</i></p><p>What's your point Mr Steele? If I was reading the Daily Mail and the words 'Stalinism' and 'Nazism' were swapped around here, it would just be another pointless left v right game. Was Stalin responsible for evil-doings? Was Nazism responsible for evil-doings? Trying to put either camp in a 'better' light is childish.</p><p>(It's interesting that you use the phrase 'killing fields' in your article to refer to Nazi deeds--the phrase originally used to describe the horror inflicted by the communist Khmer Rouge in Cambodia- one of the 'inspirations' of Stalinism.)</p><p>...Nothing for the left or the right to be feeling morally superior about in this context I think!</p>

							<p></p><p>The greatest victims of Stalin were the Russian/Soviet people. History clearly shows that because of Stalins purges, the Soviet army was poorly prepared to face the Nazi war machine, at least at the beginning. This is why millions of Soviet troops were killed the first few days of the Nazi invasion of the Soviety Union. However, the death of 30M soviet people  in the hands of the Nazi war machine, plus millions of Russians killed by Stalin do not figure in this revisionist selective recollection of history. It seems all guns are now pointed at Russia: discursive, media, economic and military.

							<p>I'm not sure it makes much sense to compare Stalinism and Nazism beyond recognizing that both represent horrific dictatorial abuses of power unparalleled in western 20th-century politics.  The far left cannot ignore Stalinism any more than it can ignore Castro's Cuba or mao's China.  An ideology of egalitarianism enacted upon through utilitarianism tends towards dictatorship where human rights are sacrificed for the greater good.</p>

							<p>On this hideous scale, counting corpses is hardly sufficient to sustain an argument for a distinction between Hitler and Stalin in terms of criminality.  Both are, almost literally, impossible to describe in the terms we apply to everyday human fallibility.  Steele's article, sadly, echoes one of the most disheartening aspects of Stalinism: the willingness, even eagerness, of well-meaning people with a genuine passion for ending oppression, to defend a monstrous system and its masters even in the face of overwhelming evidence of their error.  We have seen the same thing, somewhat more recently, in the apologists for Mao Tse-tung, who certainly ranks with Hitler and Stalin as a mass murderer on an inconceivable scale.</p><p>The left has to learn the lesson that it can be, and has been, grossly, terribly wrong in its judgments and enthusiasms, that it is deeply fallible in spite of its high minded intentions, and that it must remain skeptical of even the most outwardly charismatic revolutionary heroes.  Trying to get Stalin off the hook, even in  the most tentative and qualified way, is not going to accomplish this.  It would be far more useful to try to gain some insight into exactly how humanitarian aspirations become so easily perverted into the heedless worship of thugs.</p>

							<p>I thought Snyder's article in the New York Review of Books was fascinating; it answered a long disputed question within my mind about whether the death camps were an intrinsic part of Hitler's war strategy or not.</p><p>whatever, it really is well worth a read.</p>

							<blockquote><p>The EU must not give succour to self-interested revisionists who equate Stalinism and Nazism in an effort to smear the left</p></blockquote><p>I have read and re-read this article and am still bemused as to the point Jonathan Steele is trying to make. His byline above smacks of pure paranoia.</p><p>The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a dark episode in European history but no more disgusting and cynical than the Munich Agreement that preceded it, to which Britain and France were parties. The one thing they had in common was the desire, first by the British and French and then the Russians, to appease Hitler and delay conflict with Germany which was much better prepared for war than they.</p><p>How any of these historic episodes and their remembrance relate to any current "effort to smear the left" remains unclear, at least to me. I would suggest the drift away from the Left in Europe, such as it is, has a lot more to do with disillusionment with all the Left's doctrinaire claptrap and pathetic performances right across Europe but particularly in Britain in the immediate past - not the late 1930's.</p>

							<p>The number of Soviet dead is a gross under-estimate.  It actually shames CiF to post it.</p><blockquote><p>When it comes to numbers, Hitler's record is dominant. He killed almost twice as many people as Stalin. Snyder lists the number of European Jews murdered under German auspices at 5.7 million, German starvation of Soviet citizens at about 4 million and mass reprisal killings against civilians, mainly for actual or suspected partisan activity, as at least 750,000. Stalin killed about 5.5 million Soviet citizens by starvation and had about 700,000 people shot in the prewar Great Terror.</p></blockquote><p>Hitler's record is not dominant.  I notice that Stalin's victims of famine are being ignored while Hitler's are included.  Stalin himself admitted to ten million Kulak families being sent to camps where most of them died.  By any non-Revisionist sane count Stalin killed vastly more people than Hitler.  Perhaps twenty million.</p><blockquote><p>The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact certainly showed Stalin to be as cynical as Hitler. But to jump from that to equate the two men's record or ideology does not accord with reality.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed.  Hitler actually killed fewer people, did so far less arbitrarily and did much less damage to German society.</p><blockquote><p>Nor does it take account of the fact that Soviet policy evolved after Stalin's death so that political activity, let alone ordinary family life, in the two decades under Brezhnev was not subject to arbitrary terror.</p></blockquote><p>So if Nazi Germany had survived and also had a long, slow process of normalisation, that would have made the Holocaust far less of a crime?</p><p>Political activity was not subject to arbitrary terror?  Please point out all the liberal democratic political parties that operated in the Soviet Union under Brezhnev then.  As for family life, tell that to the victims of the Stasi who learnt from their Soviet teachers how to get brothers to spy on each other, daughters on their parents, wives on their husbands.

							<p>We are in danger of only recording the History of World War II as only pertainable<br />to the horrid atrocities committed on the Jewish population,many other people trade unionists,communists,socialist,gays,the mentally sick etc,enz,ens....<br />The Germans lost over 22 million,the Russians 29 Million,the United kingdom and Colonies 3 Million,and the Chinese 36 Million.<br />Stalinism ,could have been dismantled by the European Union when<br />it was busy subsidizing the European Farmers to grow wine lakes,milk lakes,butter mountains,cheese mountains,potato mountains,grain mountains,<br />and then dumped the lot into the Sea to artificially maintain the prices. The Berlin Wall would have collapsed 10 years before it did. The Fear and Suspicion was further exacerbated when the West used the dissidents of the Communist Block (USSR) using the disaffected Jewish diaspora of Hungary,Czechoslovakia,<br />East Germany ,and other Satellite States as it had done since the Bolshevik Revolution. Neither Russia or the United States should be seen as Europes enemy,the real enemy is the extreme right of a New 4e Reich Europe<br />promoted by NATO,Missile Shields and territorial advantage,or a rampant re armament by an unbridled militarist Russia.<br />These new European member States should not be encouraged to goad Russia ,nor to settle old scores from a time when the World was at War.</p>

							<p>Wow.</p><p>A journalist really did just try to claim that Stalin wasn't as bad as Hitler on the basis that he didn't kill quite as many millions of people.</p><p>If Jonathan Steele had any moral compass, he'd conclude Stalin was so knee-deep in blood his calculus didn't matter and that Stalin had, like Hitler, clearly become a psychotic tyrranical monster.</p><p>All of Steele's calculations are a game - nothing more. In any case, plenty of historians think Stalin brought about more deaths than Hitler. Not that it matters - no-one who is sane would seek to defend Stalin, Hitler, Soviet Communism, Nazism or any other form of totalitarianism. If you are of the left your best bet would be to just argue that Stalin and the Sovet Union weren't really leftwing or to say tyrrany is not to do with political persuasion but can appear anywhere. Instead Steele argues that Stalin isn't as bad as Hitler because he only killed "x" millions of people whereas Hitler killed "x=1" millions. Equating Hitler and Stalin isn't offensive - what is offensive is Steele's attempt to hold a brief for Stalin.</p><p>As others have pointed out, it is also unclear how this is an effort to smear the left. Everyone with any morals would surely condemn Stalin anyway - is anyone (apart from Steele) not doing so? If so, why?<br /></p>

							<p>clandulla</p><blockquote><p>The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a dark episode in European history but no more disgusting and cynical than the Munich Agreement that preceded it, to which Britain and France were parties. The one thing they had in common was the desire, first by the British and French and then the Russians, to appease Hitler and delay conflict with Germany which was much better prepared for war than they.</p></blockquote><p>Really?  No more disgusting and cynical?  I did not know that the Munich Pact had a clause giving France and Britain chunks of Czechoslovakia.  The Molotoc-Ribbentrop Pact divided up innocent countries between the two totalitarian countries.  The Munich Pact gave Germany ethnic German territory.

							<p>sounds an impressive event, the baltic way. effective, too. did gorbachev give  inches after gdansk expecting the people of the baltic states to take so many miles?</p><p>but i doubt this equation stuff has much to do with history, for which this thread already shows examples of contempt. it has to do with the appropriation of history in the present to ballast one ideology or another. less crude, less ignorant than the bnp's anglo saxon stuff, but sharing a similar tendency. on this i agree with steele.</p><p></p>

							<p>Like other people on the thread I don't get the point that is being made.</p><p>No effort is made to show why it is remotely objectionable to compare Stalinism &amp; Naziism, maybe a case can be made that they shouldn't be treated in a similar manner- but the similarities between the two regimes are so striking- mass murder, expansionism, crushing of dissent- that you should at least explain why the comparison is false.</p><p>It looks an awful lot like making excuses for a regime that many on the left have historically shown too much indulgence for.</p>

							<blockquote><p>"a Europe-wide Remembrance Day for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes".</p></blockquote><p>I'm pretty happy with this to be honest. Clearly Nazism and Stalinism were not the same, but where they converged was perpetrating violence upon their own peoples in the pursuit of protecting a political ideal, before exporting this violence mercilessly to the countries caught between their two ideological empires. This should not be a 'left-right' issue. You can believe in wealth redistribution without thinking that mass acts of arbitrary violence are necessary to achieve it. And you can believe that traditional social standards need to be preserved without regressing to delusional nostalgic racial fantasies and then liquidating all those who fail to conform.</p><p>What we learn from Stalinism and Nazism is the horror of systems where the individual is insignificant, and where the population is terrorized for the sake of some future happiness, which never arrives, because when you remove the significance of the individual, all that is left of importance is the system they serve. And so such ideologies continue to self-perpetuate, regardless of the damage done to the population, becoming ever more distant from reality, until people can simply take no more. The system becomes the end, rather than the means. You serve the system, not to make individuals happy, for they are insignificant, but because the system is good in itself. And so in the end you commit atrocities to prop up a rotten ideology. You spend time gassing ethnic minorities while your country is invaded on all sides. You puposefully starve your own citizens while ignoring real threats from expansionist neighbours.</p><p>Fuck 'revolutionary violence'. When you lose sight of the worth and significance of individual human life, there is no way you can hope to build a just or good system.</p>

							<p><i>An ideology of egalitarianism enacted upon through utilitarianism tends towards dictatorship where human rights are sacrificed for the greater good.</i></p><p>Interesting this quote - it links the economic system to left totalitarianism something that is ignored in right totalitarianism. We have numbers for the imposition of 'communist totalitarianism' but then to argue about the numbers of victims linked to the imposition of capitalism would, probably by most posters, be ruled out of order. Why this hypocrisy?</p><p>In 1998 a French team tried to work the victims of capitalism in the 20th century out in the Black Book of Capitalism. Here is the wikipedia summary of their conclusions:</p><p><b>An appendix provides an incomplete list of 20th century death tolls which Perrault attributes to the capitalist system. The list, which includes both combatant and noncombatant dead, includes an estimated 58 million dead from the First and Second World Wars, plus death tolls from various colonial wars, anticommunist wars and repressions, ethnic conflicts, and some victims of famines or malnutrition,which brings the incomplete list to a combined total of about 100 million deaths attributed to capitalism in the 20th century</b></p><p>Of course this ignores many of the most brutal effects of colonialism in the previous centuries which would multiply the deaths. The Bengalese 'holodmor' attributable to Sir Robert Clive (and the advent of British colonialism) or the Irish famine of the 19th century etc are, of course, conveniently missing.</p><p>The imposition of any system has led to millions of deaths but some are more conveniently denounced by political elites than others. Double standards?</p><p>As Halgeel84 rightly pointed out the main victims of Stalinism were the Russian people (along, of course, with other nationalities comprising the Soviet Union)- whereas the main victims of capitalism and fascism were people throughout the world from Iraq to Indonesia to Chile to India. It would primarily be for the victims to sort out their relationship to the Soviet system and not for those elites who are primary descendants of the perpetrators of other crimes conveniently swept under the carpet in this politically motivated move.     </p>

							<p>@nickweb</p><p>I agree with you, but I think Stalinism and Nazism are by no means the only ideologies that cause this. I'm a little troubled that these politicians can denounce events that existed solely in Europe, while signing up up for an adventure in Iraq that showed little regard for the harm they would bring to that population.</p>

							<p>... thanks to this Stalin's killings necessary Soviet defense was built. Only through these horrific murders, which placed fear in the Soviet people, USSR stoped the Hitler's attack and liberated half of Europe, from fascism&amp; nascism, Isn't it ?!<br />Of course it is grievous that the Hitler's nascism evil was stoped only thanks to the Stalin's evil. This is history. I dont know what will be with the world if Hitler capture the USSR, but I'm glad, that the Soviet's stoped the fascism.<br />Stalin's guilt of course big, but thanks to them we are living now in non nascism countries.</p><p>fin</p>

							<p>Better writers and philosophers than I can improve on the terms and stages, but I see this progression:</p><p><i>I think it would be better if everyone lived this way</i> (idealism) can easily mutate to <i>everyone should live this way</i> (dogmatism) then often become <i>everyone must live this way</i> (intolerance) then <i>anyone who doesnt live this way must be stopped</i> (fanaticism &#8211; this might be called the labelling stage: &#8216;enemy of the people, &#8216;denier, etc) from there it is a few short steps to <i>I order you to live this way</i> (authoritarianism) then <i>we need dictatorial powers to make people live as decreed</i> (totalitarianism) and then to slaughter (where they burn books, they will ultimately also burn people).</p><p>Left/Right labels are utterly irrelevant in this dynamic &#8211; evil is evil whatever badge it wears.</p>

							<p>"Stalin killed about 5.5 million Soviet citizens by starvation and had about 700,000 people shot in the prewar Great Terror."</p><p>Stalins death toll should not be left to Stalinists; you for instance ignore the famine of 1946&#8211;48 that killed an estimated 1 to 1.5 million lives, thanks to Soviet economic policy.  You also ignore the camps for Soviet citizens and captured Axis forces and civilians.</p><p>Vadim Erlikman estimated  deaths due to Stalin as executions, 1.5 million; gulags, 5 million; death due to deportation, 1.7 million (out of 7.5 million deported) and POWs and captured German civilians, 1 million.</p><p>The overall figure is something like Ukrainian famine 5.5 million, 46-48 famine 1.5 million and death squads/work camps 9.2 million; giving about 16 million.</p><p>One should also point out that the Nation Workers Socialist Party was also of the left, and not of the right. They were not in any way, shape or manner a product of the Conservative movement, but were a revolutionary socialist movement.</p>

							<p>The author seems to have woken the Living Dead reminants of British Stalinism.   Not something to be proud of.</p><p>wayne28</p><blockquote><p>You need to read up on your interwar history. Poland wasn't "innocent" either because it took territory from SU, Lithuania, and Czechoslovakia.</p></blockquote><p>As a pathetic piece of Stalinist apologetics that is sad.  It has no relevance.  So what if Poland did?  And what territory did it take from the USSR by the way?  That does not mean that Britain and France did and hence than there is no valid comparison.</p><p>borisbarnet</p><blockquote><p>We have numbers for the imposition of 'communist totalitarianism' but then to argue about the numbers of victims linked to the imposition of capitalism would, probably by most posters, be ruled out of order. Why this hypocrisy?</p></blockquote><p>Because Stalinism kills.  There is a man sitting in an office who signs orders to kill people.  We don't blame him when a tram runs over an old woman but we do when 14.5 million Kulaks are driven out into the snow to die slowly.  There is no person in charge of Capitalism - which makes people rich.  Who do you blame when a tram runs over someone in colonial Jamaica?  See the absurdity of your comparison?</p><blockquote><p>The Bengalese 'holodmor' attributable to Sir Robert Clive (and the advent of British colonialism) or the Irish famine of the 19th century etc are, of course, conveniently missing.</p></blockquote><p>Sorry but how is anything attributable to Clive?  And misusing the Ukrainian word for the Bengal famine is childish.  The Irish were not killed by intent or as part of any political programme.  A disease came to Ireland.  It was an act of God.  That is very different from the active programme of mass murder in the USSR.</p><blockquote><p>As Halgeel84 rightly pointed out the main victims of Stalinism were the Russian people (along, of course, with other nationalities comprising the Soviet Union)- whereas the main victims of capitalism and fascism were people throughout the world from Iraq to Indonesia to Chile to India. It would primarily be for the victims to sort out their relationship to the Soviet system and not for those elites who are primary descendants of the perpetrators of other crimes conveniently swept under the carpet in this politically motivated move.</p></blockquote><p>Fascism killed people in India?  Who?  Capitalism has massively enriched the world and cured most diseases that killed the young.  If you are going to make a dishonest count of the dead, you need to include those that capitalism has saved as well.</p><p>And as the author points out, this measure has been pushed by the victims - it is the work of the Baltic states and other victims of Stalin.</p><p>wayne28</p><blockquote><p>I agree with you, but I think Stalinism and Nazism are by no means the only ideologies that cause this. I'm a little troubled that these politicians can denounce events that existed solely in Europe, while signing up up for an adventure in Iraq that showed little regard for the harm they would bring to that population.</p></blockquote><p>Sure because Iraq is just like Stalinism.</p><p>The moderators would delete any further comment but feel free to imagine what should be here.</p><p>Bander</p><blockquote><p>... thanks to this Stalin's killings necessary Soviet defense was built. Only through these horrific murders, which placed fear in the Soviet people, USSR stoped the Hitler's attack and liberated half of Europe, from fascism&amp; nascism, Isn't it ?!</p></blockquote><p>Well no.  Stalin probably weakened Russian defences.  Purging the Army was dumb.  Driving so many people into the arms of the Nazis was dumber - the Baltic peoples and many Ukrainians welcomed the Germans as liberators because Stalin was worse.  More to the point, without Stalin, there would have been no Hitler.  Not only did Stalin play a huge role in bringing Hitler to power by refusing to allow a United Front against the Nazis, but he armed Hitler, he sold Hitler valuable strategic materials until <i>after </i>June 22 1941 and he signed the M-R Pact with Hitler and so brought the Germans up to the Soviet border.  Before that Pact the Germans could not have invaded even if they had wanted to.

							<p>9milerancher</p><blockquote><p>Steele's article reads in a similar fashion to the words one would hear if one were listening to a man speaking with his mouth full of marbles - I can't fathom what point he is trying to make.</p></blockquote><p>Really?  I think that there are many possible points he might be trying to make.  But I like to put the best interpretation possible on it - he is trying to say that the non-Fascist Right has suffered for decades because they are called Fascists even when they are not, and that is bad PR because we all hate the Nazis - so he does not want the formerly-Communist Left to suffer the same fate and be called Communists even though they used to be, because it would be bad PR should we all come to hate the Communists.</p><p>Actually it is not that clear is it?</p>

							<p>The only purpose of this ridiculous "Stalin = Hitler" equation is to divert public attention from the "inconvenient" historical facts for the authors and supporters of this "new version" of history. I think the authors and supporters are mainly from the Baltic and other "new" EU states and their US supervisors, ex anti-communists and anti-socialists, various Nazi collaborators, fascists and neo-fascists either themselves or their children who nowadays masquerade as "democrats and liberals". They desperately need to disassociate themselves from their true fascist and ultra-nationalist past and present but they can only do it by blaming somebody else - the Russians, as always. Fortunately the Russians know their history much better than anybody else, can prove the EU/US wrong and will not allow such a diversion work in practice.</p>

							<p>borisbarnet</p><p>I think that is a very interesting point and not one that I have considered before.</p><p>I instinctively think that you are very wrong and that the achievements under the capitlist system massively outweigh the wrongs - the first things which pop into my head is whether collective Soviet style farming could possibly feed the world's currently population as opposed to the more market driven system we have now which has confounded Malthus and the incredible medical advances achieved by those working in the capitlist system - but it is certainly thought provoking.

							<p>@MoveanyMountain</p><p>Sorry but it seems that you have little grasp of the famine situation - the Irish Famine and the Bengalese famine were no more acts of god than was the famine in the Soviet Union (Ukraine, Volga and Kazakhstan) in the 1930s. They were all linked to the imposition of economic systems that exacerbated the situation- the SU case to collectivisation, the Bengalese case to colonialism and the Irish Famine to the free market ideology and the export. Even as the wikipedia entry rather blandly puts it:</p><p><b>Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Ireland&#8212;where a third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for food&#8212;was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.</b></p><p>There is no way that the Irish Famine and the Bengalese famine are purely attributable to acts of god and not to economic, social and political structures which multiplied the number of victims.</p><p><b>Because Stalinism kills</b> - not of course mentioning the multiple  Pinochets, Suhartos, Videla's - the result of capitalism anyway for someone from Bhopal is death just as it was for the hundreds of thousands of Gulag victims. Death is death whether you're killed by Union Carbide or by the pen of Stalin. And just because capitalism isn't identifiable by individuals doesn't really change the result but anyway my polemic was with the poster (I forget who) who linked the deaths in the GULAG to the imposition of an economic system.</p><p><b>Capitalism has massively enriched the world and cured most diseases that killed the young. If you are going to make a dishonest count of the dead, you need to include those that capitalism has saved as well.</b></p><p>Yes so why is the life expectancy in the US about the same as that of Cuba - capitalism has meant that diseases are cured for a small percentage of the world's population and even in its richest country about 50 million people have no proper medical care. So capitalism definitely doesn't work for them.</p><p>The reimposition of fully fledged capitalism in Russia actually meant the average life expectancy falling dramatically in the 1990s and it still hasn't recovered that much in more recent years. No, this 'capitalism saving lives' thesis is pretty unsustainable too.</p>

							<p>borisbarnet</p><blockquote><p>it was the Soviet people which liberated Europe from nazism and fascism because they were defended their land from a genocidal aggressor.</p></blockquote><p>Actually it was the Soviet people who drove the Germans back because they would have been shot by the NKVD if they didn't become heroes.  The Soviet authorities murdered their own soldiers by the hundreds of thousands for being tired, for being scared or for no reason at all.</p><p>But they liberated no one.  Only the West did that.  The Red Army simply replaced one totalitarian genocidal dictatorship with an even worse totalitarian genocidal dictatorship across half of Europe.</p><p>There is no reason to be proud of being anti-Fascist unless you are also pro-Democrat, that is, anti-Communist.</p>

							<p>borisbarnet</p><blockquote><p>Sorry but it seems that you have little grasp of the famine situation - the Irish Famine and the Bengalese famine were no more acts of god than was the famine in the Soviet Union (Ukraine, Volga and Kazakhstan) in the 1930s. They were all linked to the imposition of economic systems that exacerbated the situation- the SU case to collectivisation, the Bengalese case to colonialism and the Irish Famine to the free market ideology and the export.</p></blockquote><p>I am sorry but your pop-Marxism does not equate to a grasp of the situation.  The famine in the Soviet Union was entirely artificial and to a large extent deliberate.  The Bengal Famine is harder, but no doubt the unintended and unwanted actions of British colonial officials played some role - as did the weather.  The Irish Famine had nothing to do with any new impostion at all.  It was caused by the high Irish birth rate and the potato rust.  The worst you can say about the British is that they did not interfere fast enough - although in theory they were right and Ireland's subsequent lack of famine is due to that free market and globalisation.</p><blockquote><p>was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.</p></blockquote><p>Exacerbated is not caused.  A host of factors is not an order signed in the Kremlin.  Sure, the British Government could have had other policies that would have produced other results.  But those policies in and of themselves could never have produced famine.  Unlike collectivisation.</p><blockquote><p>not of course mentioning the multiple Pinochets, Suhartos, Videla's</p></blockquote><p>Pinochet was charged with the murder or torture of just 3000 people.  A long weekend of executions during the Great Terror which went on for years and years.  Not all murdered either.  Some were just tortured.</p><p>But let's mention Pinochet's efforts at preventing Stalinism taking over Chile.  By any standard a reasonable act of self defence.</p><blockquote><p>the result of capitalism anyway for someone from Bhopal is death just as it was for the hundreds of thousands of Gulag victims. Death is death whether you're killed by Union Carbide or by the pen of Stalin.</p></blockquote><p>Again we are back with the tram accident.  It is dishonest to compare the deliberate, ideologically motivated murders of innocent people under Stalin with an accident that no one wanted in a factory.  I notice you are not counting any of the millions who died on Soviet roads and in Soviet factories - why not?  They are no less dead than those killed in Bhopal.</p><blockquote><p>And just because capitalism isn't identifiable by individuals doesn't really change the result but anyway my polemic was with the poster (I forget who) who linked the deaths in the GULAG to the imposition of an economic system.</p></blockquote><p>But the deaths in the Gulag are not the result of the imposition of an economic system.  They are the result of Stalin signing orders.  Of the NKVD carrying them out - and more!  They are the result of deliberate actions by well fed, warm, comfortable men.  And so it does change the results.  I did not kill this morning because I did not give all my salary to African famine victims.  Stalin did because he ordered the deaths of tens of millions of innocent victims.</p><blockquote><p>Yes so why is the life expectancy in the US about the same as that of Cuba - capitalism has meant that diseases are cured for a small percentage of the world's population and even in its richest country about 50 million people have no proper medical care. So capitalism definitely doesn't work for them.</p></blockquote><p>Cuba is a parasite on the discoveries of the capitalist world.  They use the products that they cannot produce themselves.  And they lie.</p><p>Your quibble about American health care is childish - there is no comparison with the hundred thousand murdered people in Cuba much less the USSR.  And about half those 50 million are so rich they have decided not to get insurance.  It is working for them.</p><blockquote><p>The reimposition of fully fledged capitalism in Russia actually meant the average life expectancy falling dramatically in the 1990s and it still hasn't recovered that much in more recent years. No, this 'capitalism saving lives' thesis is pretty unsustainable too.</p></blockquote><p>The average male life expectancy in the USSR dropped from the late 60s on.  The fact that the collapse of Socialism in the USSR has made the horror of Soviet and post-Soviet life obvious, the fact that Stalinism has destroyed all the social support structures and left Russian men no reason to live, is not a condemnation of Capitalism but of Stalinism.  Stalin is still killing.</p>

							<p>@Ebo73</p><p><b>I instinctively think that you are very wrong and that the achievements under the capitlist system massively outweigh the wrongs - the first things which pop into my head is whether collective Soviet style farming could possibly feed the world's currently population as opposed to the more market driven system we have now which has confounded Malthus and the incredible medical advances achieved by those working in the capitlist system - but it is certainly thought provoking. </b></p><p>I wouldn't argue for a Soviet style collective farming system but I wouldn't say that the market driven system has confounded Malthus in every part of the world and for every part of the population. But, of course, you are right in pointing out that there have been many advances - mainly I would argue because a system moved away from market driven solutions and towards more socialised systems even in Western Europe (the NHS and most European health systems can't be characterised as capitalist in the way that the US health system can and looking at average life expectancy I think Europe beats the US as does that poor and pretty isolated Caribbean island called Cuba which, although it lacks certain political freedoms has also made massive strides in medical advancements and for all its faults re dissidents no Great Stalinist Terror was enacted in this communist country).<br />The market  and capitalism has signified massive pharmeceutical oligopolies inflating the price of medicine and making sure that many medicines are simply beyond the reach of many societies in he globe.</p><p>Well a long discussion of course and one I'll have to continue tomorrow morning as it's 2.30 am here.</p><p>Thanks for the courteous language you wrote your post in.</p>

							<blockquote><p>As a pathetic piece of Stalinist apologetics that is sad. It has no relevance. So what if Poland did? And what territory did it take from the USSR by the way? That does not mean that Britain and France did and hence than there is no valid comparison.</p></blockquote><p>Western Belarus. Also Vilnius (when Lithuania was an independent country).

							<p>"I nominate this with Seamus Milne's pro-Ahmadinejad piece ("he's the choice of the people, the USA must accept it") as joint most sickening article ever seen on Comment is Free".</p><p>I agree with the sentiment but, unfortunately, there is lots of competition. On the domestic front the polemics of Ms Toynbee are well to the fore in this class of article. Why is it that the Guardian, more than, say, the Mail at the opposite pole, frequently seeks to square an impossible circle presenting sets of evidence that are self-evidently in total conflict. Thus indeed we have Ms Toynbee completely contradicting her output of 12 months ago in pitiful efforts to present Gordon Brown's party as something it patently is not.</p><p>Why does Mr Steele seek to present the "left" as represented by Stalin as somehow less bad than the "right" as represented by Hitler. Both regimes were historically appalling and being totalitarian were much more aligned than separated. Politics, in effect, had come full circle.</p><p>Looking back I see little to differentiate them. Hitler's killing frenzy was arguably more intense but the effects of Stalin's more leisurely purges are surely with us to this day. The article is silly, pointless and pompous. It is on a par with Mr Milne's worst - and that is saying something.</p>

							<p>I'm as Socialist as they come, but I think you need to think about what you just said Jonathan.<br />Both Nazism and Stalism came from very similar roots. Let me explain.<br />First came the Bolsheviks. They believed that only with the use of well organised terror could they create their 'Socialist Utopia'. This involved using gangs of hired thugs  - usually WWI veterans - to travel around and enforce social change. Those that resisted were killed. This meant landlords, businessmen, and all other agents of the old order.<br />However, within the muscle, there was a brain. Quite a brain in fact. A Georgian gangster, hired initially to rob banks and thus give the Bolsheviks a firm financial base. This gangster happened to also be a political genius. Let us not mince our words people, Stalin was incredible at pure power politics. He maneuvered himself so that one by one, he eliminated the entire Bolshevik elite. Thus, by the end of it, the tail wasn't just wagging the dog, it had mounted a stunning coup de grace.<br />With Germany on the other hand, it was all too similar. That fear of Communism, combined with inspiration of the goings on in Italy led the old Prussian elite to deduce this. In order to defeat the potential of Soviet hired thugs, we need hired thugs of our own. In fact, you might argue that this went back even prior to Mussolini's take over in Rome. The revolutions and attempted coups between 1918 and 1923 all seemed to involve a group called The Friecorps in one way or another.<br />Basically, like Stalin and his mob, they were hired thugs. Discruntled WWI veterans incredibly irate at the way the war went. They proved very useful indeed to the old elites who were desperate to prevent any kind of social change. Alas, this muscle had a brain as well, his name was Adolf Hitler, and the rest is history.<br />He was able to crush the communists, the socialists, and all others who stood in his way. He then out-maneuvered the Prussians, who poor fools, actually thought he could be controlled. Thus the slave became the master, and that was that.<br />Whether you like it or not those two were one and the same.</p>

							<p>borisbarnet</p><blockquote><p>not sure why you would think my argument supports slavery - actually though there is a good argument linking slavery to the development of the capitalist system in history epecially in the US and Russia</p></blockquote><p>And Russia? Wow.  There used to be a group of Marxists who tried to argue this.  I don't know anyone who takes them seriously these days.</p><blockquote><p>Pinochet was only one of the many US backed dictators in Latin America and the idea that Allende was bringing a Stalinist dictatorship to Chile is the idea of a right-wing fanatic that your post proves you to be. He happened to be the democratically elected president of Chile at the time.</p></blockquote><p>It is simply a fact.  It does not matter if you like it or think it is the opinion of a right wing fanatic or not.  He was importing East German and Cuban "security" specialists to consolidate his hold on Chile.  Why would the Communists send him so much help?  His daughter ended up marrying one of the Cubans who went on to rise in the Cuban equivalent of the KGB.</p><blockquote><p>Actually apart from the fact that you have no links to the so-called 'facts' in your piece I haven't got the time to check them but they are absurd. Re-integration of Russia into the capitalist world system began in the early 70s but of course the dramatic fall was in the 90s - blaming that on Stalin just shows how far fetched your arguments are - (he had already been dead four decades).</p></blockquote><p>Ahh, I see.  You are ideologically flexible with everything bad by definition being the fault of capitalism I see.  You are welcome to check my facts.  They too are true regardless of what you think about them.</p><p>Stalin was dead, but of course his system did not die until after 1989 in a formal sense and in the broader sense, it is still alive to this day.  Stalin waged war on Russia his whole life.  He assaulted it brutally and did his best to kill it.  That legacy of hatred and self loathing remains.  Stalin is dead but Stalinism kept on killing and killing.  As it does today in some other places.</p><blockquote><p>How can Cuba be a parasite on the capitalist world when there have been decades of embargo going on? Strange logic here too. Hundred thousand people murdered in Cuba- links? I'd guess their capital punishment record doesn't match the US's (I am against capital punishment both in Cuba and the US btw for those who may accuse me of being a Castro apologist).</p></blockquote><p>If you're against capital punishment but for the biggest murderers in history you're a hypocrite rather than an apologist.  And you'd guess wrong.  Those numbers in a small nation like Cuba are massive.  The US, after all, has only executed just over 15,000 since 1608.  A tenth of the Cuban toll in 400 years as opposed to 50.  On top of which the American population is about thirty times as big.</p><p>Cuba is parasitic in that it did not invent the drugs they use (although Cubans used to do good work), they do not discover the science they rely on.  They copy it from the West.  Besides, Cuba can trade with the world as the embargo is only with the US.</p><blockquote><p>Sorry MAM but there was no order signed by the Kremlin to start a famine - it was the result of both natural causes and imposition of economic doctrine too but, of course, exacerbated by the forced collectivisation programme just as the Irish famine was the result of both natural cause and the imposition of British policies to export agricultural products during the famine (something actually repeated during the Stalin epoch famine). By the way agricultural production in Yeltsin's Russia fell by more than agricultural production under Stalin.</p></blockquote><p>There was an order to impose collectivisation and remove crops from the countryside at levels that meant the population could not feed itself.  What is more by that time Stalin knew what the consequences of collectivisation would be.  The Soviet Union had tried it during War Communism - which also caused famine and resulted in the Party sending out armed squads to loot the farms of the peasants.  So Stalin knowingly imposed a system that had starved people the last time he tried it.  He also continued with it even when it was causing mass famine.  And there was no bad weather. It was entirely artificial.</p><p>There were no British policies to export anything. That was the point of their free trade doctrine.  They did nothing to interfere with the market even when they should have.  So you're wrong.  In fact you are not merely wrong.</p><p>You release slaves from slavery, which is what collectivisation was, they stop working.  The difference is Yeltsin cared and so there was no mass famine.  Stalin did not and so there was.  Yeltsin found ways and means to feed all of Russia's people.  Famine in the USSR was not the product of Marxist policies alone, it was the product of Marxist policies and indifference to suffering.
