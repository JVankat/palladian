						<p>The BBC has learned that the government plans to ask MPs to vote next week on taking the first step towards changing Britain's voting system. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Swingometer" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/swingometer226.jpg" width="226" height="211" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></span>The move could mean that in future general elections - though not in this year's - voters would be asked to rank candidates by preference instead of putting a cross next to one name as now. </p>

<p>Senior ministers agreed today to propose an amendment to the Constitutional Renewal Bill to offer voters a referendum by the autumn of 2011 on scrapping Britain's "first past the post" system and replacing it with the "alternative vote" (AV) system. The cabinet is to be asked to approve the plan tomorrow, allowing Gordon Brown to unveil the idea in a speech he is delivering on political reform at lunchtime. </p>

<p>Under AV - the voting system used in Australia - every candidate is ranked on the ballot paper. If no candidate wins at least half of the votes, the votes of losing candidates are redistributed until a winner emerges with an overall majority. </p>

<p>The system is not a form of proportional representation. Indeed, in the event of a big electoral swing, it can exaggerate the majority that a winning party gets. </p>

<p>Gordon Brown backed AV at Prime Minister's Questions recently, claiming that "[g]iven the issues that have arisen about trust in politics, there is a case for every member of this House coming here with the support of more than 50% of the electors," but has met opposition from a sizeable group of Labour MPs who fear that the move could be a thin end of a wedge leading to full PR - which could undermine Labour in its traditional heartlands. </p>

<p>However, a growing number of ministers have argued that a vote on a referendum will expose the Conservative Party as opposed to political reform and will woo Liberal Democrat voters and Lib Dem MPs whose votes might be needed in the event of a hung Parliament. </p>

<p>Even if the Commons votes for a referendum on AV next week, the measure is very unlikely to become law as there is not sufficient time between now and the general election for it to pass through all its Parliamentary stages.<br />
</p>

Such a system would almost by definition prevent individuals standing for Parliament.<BR /><BR />So this plan should be consigned to the Gerrymandering Dustbin in the sky.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_232539"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog9/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=91848197&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_91848856"> <span class="comments_comment_number">33.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment33" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2010/02/electoral_refor.html?postId=91848856#comment_91848856">20:05pm</a> on 1st Feb 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=12377831" class="comment_username_232639">fairlyopenmind</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p> Odd.

A hung parliament can cause a number of issues, particularly if all the other parties 'gang up' and block all decisions made by the ruling party. Perhaps a complete scrapping of the Lords and replacing it with a PR system whilst keeping the Commons under a similar system, but with fewer MPs. Once a decision has been made by the Commons, it is passed to the Lords. They do not have complete overriding powers, but can send a bill back to the Commons with changes. If a bill is bounced back and forth a certain number of times a referendum is held. In order for the increase in the number of referendums to be possible, additional methods of voting in referendums should be made open. Whilst the referendum idea is a bit far IMHO I do believe that a balance of PR in the 'Lords' with FPTP in the Commons could bring a balance to UK politics. Election promises should be legally bonding to an extent. i.e. the ruling party MUST propose it in parliament and the members of the ruling party must NOT vote against it. Therefore MPs cannot be blamed if their political opponents actively prevent them providing an electoral promise. The ruling party may, however, seek to have a promise altered in extreme circumstances. One such example would be major budget cuts (where increases in spending had been promised) due to the credit crunch.<BR /><BR />This is all just what came to mind whilst I was posting but, like all great ideas, it needs some pub time!</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_233599"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog9/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=91853234&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_91853767"> <span class="comments_comment_number">51.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment51" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2010/02/electoral_refor.html?postId=91853767#comment_91853767">21:18pm</a> on 1st Feb 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=14243730" class="comment_username_848737">sagamix</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>There's no question that some form of PR would be a fairer, more sensible way of conducting elections.

There are three things I would point out about the Australian system. Firstly, (as already noted above) it is illegal not to vote and hence, one has no choice but to deal with the second point, that the ballot papers are absolutely huge (getting on to A3 huge) and very complicated. UK voters will definitely hate this the first few time they vote and they will need help in understanding how to vote, with the subsequent furore that will attend any close result.  Thirdly, the system leads to "preferences" whereby parties tell their supporters the order in which to vote for all the other parties. This has the effect of creating another strata of politics whereby major parties do deals with the smaller ones to get higher up their preference rankings. The result of all this complexity is that outside the polling booths, rival activists are armed with their "how to vote" flyers and it will all be rather unpleasant for the average British voter who will quickly become nostalgic for the one cross next to one name system.<BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_246277"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog9/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=91860669&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_91860694"> <span class="comments_comment_number">70.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment70" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2010/02/electoral_refor.html?postId=91860694#comment_91860694">00:52am</a> on 2nd Feb 2010, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=9937776" class="comment_username_231621">DH Wilko</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>would be a good idea.

As a result many become mere lobby fodder.<BR /><BR />It means also that governments can get an overwhelming majority on a minority of actual votes.<BR /><BR />Naturally most MP's like the single member system which gives many of them job security, and governments more power than their popularity in the country deserves. In support of the system, they cite "constituency links", without explaining what advantages this gives electors. <BR /><BR />In fact many electors find that this is a disadvantage when they are seeking support from an MP, to deal with a problem or promote a cause. There is a convention that MP's do not help with the problems of people outside their own constituency. So if your own MP is ineffective or hostile, you have no alternative. How much better for constituents, but inconvenient for MPs, it would be if they could shop around 3 or 4 MPs.<BR /><BR />It is important that there should not be ordered party lists, so that voters would have the chance to choose, not only between parties, but between candidates from the same party.<BR /><BR />Most MP's of course hate these ideas which would mean that they would have to compete with colleagues to provide a good service. <BR /><BR />Many politicians have told us repeatedly in recent years about the importance of competition, even though it means poor job security.
