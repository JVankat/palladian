      <p align="justify">Although learning is clearly established as a major life function, 
      nowhere in the federal regulations (504/ADA) is there a definition of 
      specific learning disabilities that pertains to adults and higher 
      education. Diagnosis of learning disabilities made in the public schools 
      are typically based on the definition found in Public Law 94-142, the 
      Education for All Handicapped Children Act as follows: </p>
      <p align="justify">The term &quot; specific learning disability&quot; is a disorder in one or more 
      of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using 
      language, spoken or written, which may manifest itself in an imperfect 
      ability to listen, speak, read, write, spell or to do mathematical 
      calculations. The term included such conditions as perceptual handicaps, 
      brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental 
      aphasia. The term does not include children who have learning disabilities 
      which are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor handicaps, or 
      mental retardation, or emotional disturbance, or environmental, cultural, 
      or academic disadvantage. (U.S. Department of Education, 1977, p. 65083)
      </p>
      <p align="justify">The definition proposed by the National Joint Committee on Learning 
      Disabilities (NJCLD), in 1988, is widely accepted as the definition that 
      most appropriately addresses learning disability issues as they pertain to 
      students in higher education and adults as follows: </p>
      <p align="justify">Learning disabilities is a general term that refers to a heterogeneous 
      group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the 
      acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning, 
      or mathematical abilities. These disorders are intrinsic to the 
      individual, presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction, and 
      may occur across the life span. Problems in self-regulatory behaviors, 
      social perception, and social interaction may exist with learning 
      disabilities but do not of themselves constitute a learning disability. 
      Although learning disabilities may occur concomitantly with other 
      handicapping conditions (for example, sensory impairment, mental 
      retardation, serious emotional disturbance) or with extrinsic influences 
      (such as, cultural differences, insufficient or inappropriate 
      instruction), they are not the result of those conditions or influences. 
      (National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities, 1988, p. 1) </p>

      <p ALIGN="center"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Understanding the Nature and Impact of Specific Learning 
      Disabilities</span></p>
      </b>
      <p align="justify">1. Learning disabilities are life-long and heterogeneous in nature. 
      They affect the manner in which individuals of average to superior general 
      intellectual ability take in information and retain and express the 
      knowledge and understanding they possess. They are presumably due to 
      central nervous system dysfunction and they occur in all languages, 
      culture, and nations of the world. </p>
      <p>2. Learning disabilities are frequently inconsistent. Problems 
      manifested may change throughout life depending upon the setting and 
      learning demands. They may manifest in only one academic area, such as 
      reading or they may manifest across a variety of subject areas and 
      disciplines. </p>
      <p>3. Having learning disabilities can be frustrating. They are not 
      visible, and family, teachers and peers frequently do not understand the 
      challenges faced by individuals with learning disabilities. Individuals 
      with learning disabilities often have to prove their disability is &quot;real&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>4. Learning disabilities are not emotional disorders, a form of mental 
      retardation, or difficulties due to sensory impairments. They are not 
      primarily due to environmental or cultural influences. However, they can 
      occur concomitantly. </p>

      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Areas Most Impacted by Learning Disabilities</span></p>
      </b>
      <p>Some of the areas most commonly impacted by specific learning 
      disabilities are: reading, written expression, mathematics, listening 
      comprehension, oral expression, reasoning, attention, thinking, learning 
      efficiency, memory, organization, time management, or social perception. 
      No one person will manifest difficulties in all areas.</p>

      <p>These are students with average to above average ability. None will 
      manifest all of these characteristics. Many will offset areas of 
      disability with significant ability in other areas.</p>

      <p align="justify">ADHD is one of the most researched areas in child and adolescent mental 
      health. However, the precise cause of the disorder is still unknown. 
      Available evidence suggests that ADHD is genetic. It is a brain-</p>
      <p align="justify">based biological disorder. Low levels of dopamine (a brain chemical), 
      which is a neurotransmitter (a type of brain chemical), are found in 
      children with ADHD. Brain imaging studies using PET scanners (positron 
      emission tomography; a form of brain imaging that makes it possible to 
      observe the human brain at work) show that brain metabolism in children 
      with ADHD is lower in the areas of the brain that control attention, 
      social judgment, and movement.</p>

      <p align="justify">Estimates suggest that between 3 to 5 percent of all children have 
      ADHD. Boys are two to three times more likely to have ADHD than girls.</p>
      <p align="justify">Many parents of children with ADHD experienced symptoms of ADHD when 
      they were younger. ADHD is commonly found in brothers and sisters within 
      the same family. Most families seek help when their child's symptoms begin 
      to interfere with learning and adjustment to the expectations of school 
      and age-appropriate activities.</p>

      professional usually identifies ADHD in children. A detailed history of 
      the child's behavior from parents and teachers, observations of the 
      child's behavior, and psychoeducational testing contribute to making the 
      diagnosis of ADHD. Further, because ADHD is a group of symptoms, often 
      diagnosis depends on evaluating results from several different types of 
      evaluations, including physical, neurological, and psychological. Certain 
      tests may be used to rule out other conditions, and some may be used to 
      test intelligence and certain skill sets. Consult your child's physician 
      for more information.</p>

      <p align="justify">Major components of treatment for children with ADHD include parental 
      support and education in behavioral training, appropriate school 
      placement, and possibly medication. Although not only children benefit 
      from medication, and Highpoint Academy certainly does not recommend or 
      endorse medication due to possible side-effects, treatment with a psychostimulant is 
      deemed highly 
      effective in 75 to 90 percent of children with ADHD.</p>

          <p align="justify">Psychostimulant medications:</b><br>
          Psychostimulant medications are used for their ability to balance 
          chemicals in the brain that prohibit the child from maintaining 
          attention and controlling impulses. They help &quot;stimulate&quot; or help the 
          brain to focus and may be used to reduce the major characteristics of 
          ADHD, which include the following inattention, impulsivity, and 
          hyperactivity.</p>
          <p align="justify">Different psychostimulant medications that are commonly used to 
          treat ADHD include the following:</p>
          <dir>
            <li>methylphenidate (Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta) </li>
            <li>dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) </li>
            <li>pemoline (Cylert) </li>
            <li>a mixture of amphetamine salts (Adderall)</li>
          </dir>
          <p align="justify">Psychostimulants have been used to treat childhood behavior 
          disorders since the 1930s. They have been widely studied. Stimulants 
          take effect in the body quickly, work for one to four hours, and then 
          leave the body quickly. Doses of stimulant medications need to be 
          timed to match the child's school schedule - to help the child pay 
          attention for a longer period of time and improve classroom 
          performance. The common side effects of stimulants may include, but 
          are not limited to, the following:</p>
          <dir>
            <li>insomnia</li>
            <li>decreased appetite</li>
            <li>stomach aches</li>
            <li>headaches</li>
            <li>jitteriness</li>
            <li>rebound activation (when the effect of the stimulant wears off, 
              hyperactive and impulsive behaviors may increase for a short 
              period of time)</li>

          </b>Parenting children with ADHD may be difficult and can present 
          challenges that create stress within the family. Classes in behavior 
          management skills for parents can help reduce stress for all family 
          members. Training in behavior management skills for parents usually 
          occurs in a group setting which encourages parent-to-parent support. 
          Behavior management skills may include the following:</p>

            </li>
          </dir>
          <p align="justify">Teachers may also be taught behavior management skills to use in 
          the classroom setting. Training for teachers usually includes use of 
          daily behavior reports that communicate in-school behaviors to 
          parents.</p>
          <p align="justify">Behavior management techniques tend to improve targeted behaviors 
          (such as completing school work or keeping the child's hands to 
          himself/herself), but are not usually helpful in reducing overall 
          inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.</p>
