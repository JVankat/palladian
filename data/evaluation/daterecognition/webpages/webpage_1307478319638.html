<meta name="description" content="SATURDAY, AUGUST 28, 2010 marked the centenary of the CMM Group of companies. Not of Wallace Pharmaceuticals or Colfax Laboratories or products like Old Spice and Handyplast with whom the name CMM is synonymous with now. But the 100th anniversary of the pharmacy which was started on August 28, 1910 by Cosme Matias Menezes, father of the legendary Pascoal Jose Menezes. Though the CMM Group; rather the individual companies that once formed the CMM Group, is now primarily into manufacturing of a wide range of goods from cosmetics to toothbrushes to pharmaceutical companies, the origin of this group goes back to trading. As indeed, the origin of most of the big business houses in Goa whether it is the Salgaocars or the Chowgules or the Caculos or the Borkars or the Naiks of the Tata Dealership as also the Naiks of Monginis and Commonwealth Developers." />

       <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>By Rajan Narayan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>On the occasion of the centenery of the CMM and the Caculo groups, we go back in time to the first generation who laid the foundation for gen-next mega industrial and business empires.</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SATURDAY, AUGUST 28, 2010 marked the centenary of the CMM Group of companies.  Not of Wallace Pharmaceuticals or Colfax Laboratories or products like Old Spice and Handyplast with whom the name CMM is synonymous with now. But the 100th anniversary of the pharmacy which was started on August 28, 1910 by Cosme Matias Menezes, father of the legendary Pascoal Jose Menezes. Though the CMM Group; rather the individual companies that once formed the CMM Group, is now primarily into manufacturing of a wide range of goods from cosmetics to toothbrushes to pharmaceutical companies, the origin of this group goes back to trading. As indeed, the origin of most of the big business houses in Goa whether it is the Salgaocars or the Chowgules or the Caculos or the Borkars or the Naiks of the Tata Dealership as also the Naiks of Monginis and Commonwealth Developers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The late V M Salgaocar who set up the mining and hotel conglomerate V M Salgaocar and Brother, started out as a vegetable vendor and a trader at a small shop at Ribandar. The Caculos started out as a trading house dealing in a wide range of brands of consumer durables. The Magnum group that has a major presence now in the construction business, started off as carpenters with furniture shops and are still in the furniture business. The now exclusive dealers of Tata motors, Narasimha Damodar Naik were, in fact, the dealers for Mercedes cars during the pre-liberation period. The Herald Publications has its origins in the stationary shop started by the late Antonio Caetano Fernandes.  The foundation of some of the largest business and trading houses in the state were the shops started by the grandfathers or the great grandfathers of the present generation which, with rare exceptions, has moved out of trading into manufacturer and dealership of high-end consumer durables and automobiles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trading, and not mining or the tourism industry, was the backbone of Goa&#8217;s economy prior to the liberation. It was only in the ‘50s that mining, as an organised activity, began. Tourism owes its origins to the discovery of Goa as a virgin paradise, by the flower children and the hippies who had revolted against the Vietnam War and the crass commercialism in Europe. Indeed, the Portuguese conquest of Goa was largely motivated by the fact that Goa was a major trading centre in the middle-ages where a wide range of commodities varying from spices to tobacco to horses and even slaves, were traded. In the early 20th century, Goa became a major shopping destination for the rest of India and remained a major shopping destination for Indians even after India became independent till Goa was liberated on December 19, 1961.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FREE PORT BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">THIS was because - similar to today&#8217;s Dubai - Goa was a free port where customs duties were negligible. It became a favourite shopping destination post-Indian independence because in the first flush of Indian independence, the first government of India was committed to a regime of austerity. The import of most foreign products whether it was blades or watches or jewellery or even of soft drinks was banned. So the whole of India came to Goa to do their shopping which led to the golden age of trade in Goa. Among the pioneers of trade, were not only Hindu business houses like the Salgaocars and Joshis of Vasco, the Naiks of Margao, the Caculos and the Duklos of Panjim but also the Borim Muslims business houses like the Viranis and the Mawanis and the Adnanis who with their natural business acumen set up some of the first trading establishments in Goa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I first visited Goa in the late seventies to cover the ramponnkar agitation organised by former MLA Mathany Saldanha with the backing of the Jesuit priests Father Bras Faleiro, I stayed in Panaji. And the only shops that I remember during my then visit to Goa were the Caculos, the Viranis, the Bharne shop selling textiles, the J D Fernandes shop selling stationary, the Angle&#8217;s shops selling sports goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FISH ON ROPE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And a clutch of shops around the Old Secretariat which sold souvenirs to tourists such as fish on a rope which were actually fish shaped soaps with strings attached. The predecessors of the many hand-washes you get in the market today. And, of course, for cashew nuts we went to Zantye&#8217;s cashew nut outlets and took sparkling wine back from the Real Group of Companies outlet near the Azad Maidan. For books or even magazines and newspapers, there was only Varsha bookstall and, of course, Singbals near the Panaji church and the bookshop at the Mandovi restaurant. When I came to Goa in 1983, to start the English edition of the old Portuguese paper O Heraldo, I used to have breakfast at Bhosale Café at 6 am while waiting for the paper to come from the printing press then located in Merces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the eighties the shops run by the first or second generation of Goan businessmen were known for the personal touch of the founders. Whether it was at the J D Fernandes stationary shop or the Bharne textile shop or the Caculo or Virani shops, the owner sat at the cash-counter. The sons were the sales persons. Trade was family-centric. And there was the personal touch with the owner of the shop knowing all his regular customers and personally welcoming them into the shops. Unfortunately, over the decades, the shops expanded and got professionalized. With the third and the fourth generations moving out of trading, to take advantage of the bigger opportunities that an independent Goa offered, the personal touch disappeared and, indeed, many traditional Goan retail establishments shut shop and ventured into manufacturer or dealerships, rather than continue in the retail trade. Just as the second and third and the fourth generations of the Lotlikars, the traditional jewellers gave up the jewellery trade and many of the traditional poders gave up the confectionary business. Fortunately, there are still business establishments, ranging from the Café Central to the Real Group to the Bharnes and the Veljees, where the family is still involved in the retail business hands on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW RETAIL ENTRANTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">THE eighties and the nineties saw the exit of some of the historical trading establishments from the retail trade.  It also saw the entry of a new generation of retailers. This new generation included retailers like the Magson&#8217;s Supermarket which was the first of its kind in Panaji city. Just as the Borkar&#8217;s Supermarket was the first of its kind in Margao. Prakash Pereira of Champs challenged the historical monopoly of the Angle&#8217;s in the retailing of sports goods. The Tavoras set up not only Poshak, the most prestigious readymade garments, but even ventured into setting up a chain of Udupi hotels under the Navtara brand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BRANDED STORES</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But it was really non-Goans and franchises of internationally branded goods that filled the vacuum created by the traditional trading houses moving out of the trading area and diversifying into mining and manufacturing. The complexion, particularly of 18 June Road, named after the day on which Ram Manohar Lohia began the final thrust towards liberation, is a reflection of the fact that non-Goans have been taking over or have taken over the retail trade in the state. It was in the 90s that shops like the Bombay Bazaar started by Manjit Singh of Sher-e-Punjab and Barons and other retail outlets were established. The new millennium saw the entry into Goa of franchises of leading brands ranging from the Wills Lifestyle store to the boutiques store like Fabindia and Bombay stores, Fusionaccess and the other establishments targeted at the high-end tourists.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TOURISM BENEFICIARIES </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">TOURISM opened out major opportunities for the retail trade in Goa. But regrettably neither traditional Goan trading houses or enterprising young first generation Goans have exploited the vast market provided by the fact that Goa attracts as many as 15 to 20 lakh tourists both domestic and foreign every year. The tourist traffic or, at least, the high-end of the tourism trade, was taken over almost entirely by Kashmiri traders. Starting with the Cottage Industries Exposition in Saligao to establishments in all the seven-star and five-star hotels, the Kashmiri&#8217;s have developed a virtual monopoly over the high-end tourism trade. Forget about shops in five star hotels. On every approach road to even the remotest beaches in Goa, there are more Kashmiri shops than Goan shops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the lowest end of the scale, of the street hawking, or rather, the beach hawking, the Lamanis have been the major beneficiaries of the tourism bonanza in trading in Goa. The biggest tragedy is in the coastal belts, whether it is Calangute or Colva or Cavelossim or Baga or even in Morjim or Arambol, Goans have opted for renting out their shops and even their residences to Kashmiris and outsiders, rather than sustaining the great pre-liberation trading traditions of Goa. So far, it is fortunately Goans who have been the pioneers in setting up shopping malls in Goa, dramatised by the G mall started by Pravin Gosalia in Margao who recently launched a branch in Panjim. But, in just a few years the G Mall will be overshadowed by all the mega malls that are under construction in various parts of Goa, belonging to big chains, like the Inorbit mall of Mumbai.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TRADE BOOSTS TAXES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DURING the pre-liberation days, when trade received encouragement and patronage and support, if only by default, because imports were freely allowed and customs duties were nominal. Successive governments in Goa have failed to appreciate the contribution of retail trade not only to the foundation of the traditional Goan industrial houses, but their continuing contribution to the Goan economy. The retail trade in Goa, according to Vallabh Kamat, the commissioner of commercial taxes contributes at least 20% of the total commercial taxes collected by the state. If one includes restaurants and liquor vendors under the category of retail trade, the contribution to the exchequer of trade would be even higher. Besides commercial taxes, in the form of the value added tax, it is trade which sustains most of the municipal councils and even the village panchayats in the state. The trade licence fee and the trade tax and the various other levies and fees, whether it is by way of electricity bills or water bills or the various fees for registering and operating trading establishments, are a major contributors to the revenues of panchayats and civic bodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EMPLOYMENT</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WHENEVER there is talk about employment and creating new job opportunities in Goa, the role of the retail trade is again overlooked and not adequately recognised even by the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, forget about the government of Goa and its various departments. Budgetary figures confirm that the service sector has long since overtaken the agriculture and manufacturing sectors as the largest employers in Goa. But when economist and politicians talk about the service sector, they tend to emphasize the contribution of the hotel industry and ignore retail trade. The bitter ground reality is that the hospitality industry in the state has done little or nothing for Goans because the vast majority of the employees, not only in the starred hotels but even the shacks on the beaches, are non-Goans. This is because, whether it is the starred hotels or the shacks or the high-end restaurants, it is trainees from the hotel management and training institutions, who form the bulk of the staff in the hospitality industry. Because they are willing to work for lesser wages and - in the case of the trainees - they want just the service certificate from the five-star hotel they work for, which is a passport for higher paying jobs in the hospitality sector outside Goa. For the Goan, who does not have much education or has dropped out of school, it is the trading establishments which come to their rescue. I would tend to believe that retail contributes more jobs in Goa than either manufacturing or the organised sector of the hospitality industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NON-STOP EXHIBITIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">VIRTUALLY the last nail in the coffin of the retail trade, which is going through a serious crisis because of the steep increase in real estate prices and the extortion by nearly every government department from civic bodies to the weights and measures department and the food and drugs administration, is the proliferation of consumer exhibitions which have taken on the dimension of a non-stop tiatr. In the eighties and the nineties, there were occasional consumer exhibitions unlike in more recent times, when there are consumer exhibitions all the year round. Exhibitions are meant to exhibit and not sell consumer goods. What pass off as exhibitions in Goa, are mega shopping festivals at which, with honourable exceptions, manufacturers of substandard products like to create an illusion that the products on sale are cheaper than those in the retail shops. Unfortunately, some established manufacturers are also taking the exhibition route to deny the registered retailers, who have spent so much time and money building up their brand images, their legitimate commissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MELAS ILLEGAL</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The irony is that neither the Shops and Establishments Act nor the Municipalities Act or the Panchayat Act, have any legal provision for permitting the sale of consumer products at exhibitions. So much so, prima facie all the consumer melas masquerading as exhibitions, are illegal. Worse still, the organisers of exhibitions and those who take stalls at exhibitions, enjoy all the benefits of retailers without having to bear any of the responsibilities that registered retail trade has to bear. Organisers of exhibitions are able to evade payment of value added tax because bills are seldom issued in exhibitions. Organisers of exhibitions do not have to invest into land or the cost of setting up a retail establishment and furnishing it. Organisers of exhibitions and stalls, selling products at exhibitions, have been getting away with violating the rules relating to Weights and Measures and provisions of the Food and Drugs Administration Act, while even small restaurants have to pay thousands of rupees by way of licence fee besides value added tax. Food outlets at exhibitions have to pay only Rs25 a day, for selling food products whether cooked or uncooked. Unlike registered retail establishment, which have to follow all the rules of the Shops and Establishment Act including paying minimum wages of Rs150 a day, organisers of exhibitions and stall-holders getaway with paying a pittance of a wage. There is no level playing field between registered retail establishments and exhibitions. And there is no doubt that exhibitions have been severely undermining the organised retail trade which has contributed and continues to contribute so much to the state economy. Consumers get into a frenzy of shopping whenever a shopping mela, masquerading as an exhibition, takes place. Only to repent at leisure when they find that the pressure-cooker or the non-stick pan they have bought at very cheap prices are sub standard. Unlike in the case of purchases from registered retail establishments, there is no accountability in consumer establishments, as the stall which sold you the substandard product, is more often than not a fly by night operator, who is not there for you to confront after the exhibition is over.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ACCOUNTABILITY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FOR years now the retail trades have called for a ban for exhibitions. The retail cell of the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry has submitted several memorandums to the government and to various departments, protesting against the sins of omission and commission of fly by night operators holding consumer exhibitions throughout the year in the state at their cost. The retail trade has been pointing out that the government has an obligation to create a level playing field and make organisers of exhibitions and people who hire their venues for exhibitions, like the municipal corporations, the private clubs and even educational institutions like Don Bosco High School and cultural institutions like the Kala Academy, more accountable. They have not succeeded, or only partially succeeded. Because, unlike the mine owners and the hospitality industry or even the private bus operators, the retail trade is not united and does not have a lobby. Even the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is supposed to be a party of traders, has not been extending any support to the registered retail trade. Manohar Parrikar, the Panaji MLA, has not even done what the Margao MLA, Digamber Kamat, has done by banning retail exhibitions within the jurisdiction of the Margao Municipal Corporation. The exhibitors, on the other hand, have a powerful lobby and pay huge kickbacks to corporators, sarpanchas and government officials, to overlook their sins of omission and commission. In a year, when several leading trading houses are celebrating their centenary, the government of Goa must liberate the retail trade from the clutches of organisers of exhibition in the state. Because retail is the foundation stone of industry in Goa and is the largest employer of Goans. Retailers, on their part, have to come together and form a powerful lobby to protect their interests and strengthen the retail cell of the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Footwear Pioneer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Born in a Shia Imami Ismaili family in 1941 in Portuguese ruled Goa, Mr Karim Hassam Andani was a hardworking, god-fearing lad, family circumstances led him to take up the arduous task of contributing to the family kitty by cutting short his education. He had nine siblings, five brothers and three sisters and was the eighth child of his parents. The family was a part of the bigger community of Ismaili Muslims who then were new migrants into Goa from Gujarat and Maharashtra. They settled in Panaji and Margao and were active as merchants and traders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His father, Hassam Nazarally Andani was a grocery merchant and believed his sons should start off in a small manner and work their way upwards. In 1956, Karim started selling aluminium boxes, on foot in all the residential areas of Altinho, which was then a very posh locality, while Goa was still under Portuguese rule. These were actually discarded packaging units used in homes for storage purposes. His confidence grew steadily and in 1958 he began to sell manufactured cloth that came from British India into Portuguese-ruled Goa on the footpath. He went on to start a wooden makeshift mobile stall of 4&#215;4 feet on the footpath in and around Panaji. Adnani&#8217;s hard work paid off and he managed to put up a permanent stall in the Panaji market in 1963.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the while building a faithful clientele across all communities, he went on to specialise cloth. He managed to put up a one door shop on M G Road in 1967, which was then a prime location in Panaji and in 1975 extended this shop to a two door establishment. A father of four daughters by then, he was ably supported by his wife, Mrs Kulsum Karim Andani, in all his business activities. They expanded into readymade garments from manufactured cloth. In 1978, this couple was blessed with a son, Sayju. The advent of franchise stores saw both father and son change the shops into Goa&#8217;s first Liberty Shoes Store in 2000. Karim Andani passed away in June 2010 leaving behind a legacy of hard work and clean moral ethics for all his 5 children and 7 grandchildren.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>THE UNSUNG ‘BARD&#8217;! - Maganlal Monji Canji</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NO HISTORY on retail and commerce in Goa can be complete without the mention of this pioneering and adventurous spirit of a self-made entrepreneur who overcame every conceivable odd to nurture and fructify his vision of carrying out trade in Portuguese Goa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His deeds were generally unsung because of his reclusive nature. But there would hardly be a Catholic (or Hindu) family of older Goa who have not had a contact with this ‘gentleman of the highest order of a businessman&#8217;. His salient works&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Established trade and business in 1920&#8217;s despite being a non-Goan! He survived to oversee three businesses flourished under him and also helped his brothers&#8217; families setup businesses Margao and Mapusa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. His sense of etiquette was impeccable which made him a darling of the Portuguese and an envy of many a true-blooded Goans. At 95 years, RTP (Portuguese channel on TV) interviewed him for being the ‘pride of Portuguese Goa&#8217;!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. He traded in only the most exclusive and world renowned brands (though his frugal lifestyle did not permit him to use any of them on himself). He had exclusive rights on fountain pens like Conklin (USA), Hartman, Shaeffers and Parker. Watches such as Elgin, Omega and Orion and ‘Cremens&#8217;, the gold plated buttons from USA, were only available with him due to his discerning eye for collectibles. He brought in the world renowned Chinese crockery ‘Soko China&#8217; and the Japanese ‘Satsuma&#8217;. His selection of Macau camphor chests and mother of pearl inlay items brought in sharp traders from Mumbai (Bombay) and across the borders. His selection also included antimonyware and lacquerware, some of which adorn the heritage houses of Goa today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He traded in perfumes like ‘ Walti&#8217;, ‘Evening in Paris&#8217; and ‘Swing&#8217;. Chanel was first brought to Goan shores by him. Besides, he was very fond of ‘Fruit of the Loom&#8217; and interwoven socks and scarves and ‘granates&#8217; which he sold as his specialty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was the first and only dealer in exquisite Japanese ‘Kimono&#8217; dresses which he personally selected in his collections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing exists today of his achievements and trade, on paper. His best mode of advertisement was word of mouth and talk about him to any Goan who remembers. We will hear stories on which legends are built.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bharne&#8217;s creator</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">M/s Bharne Creations was established in the year 1904 by the founder, Shri Atchut Bharne. A small textile merchant to start with, the firm has grown to be one of the leading textile and garment store around Goa. The second generation Mr Santu A Bharne joined in the above trade followed by the third generation Mr Govind and Vinay Bharne.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, the business is managed by the fourth generation Mr Sanjay and Sachin Bharne along with the fifth generation youngsters Mr Samrudh and Siddhant Bharne. The store has a big list of fixed clientele mainly due to the best quality at the right price policy that the store has maintained besides the personalised service that the store is always known for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quality and trust is what has been the driving force behind the success of this store and what the owners and dedicated staff have tried to maintain, which has kept the ball rolling for over 106 Years!<br />
Their slogan ‘WINNING HEARTS FOR OVER 100 YEARS&#8217; says it all.</p>
