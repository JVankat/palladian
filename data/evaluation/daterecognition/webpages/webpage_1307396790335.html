<B>Academic Year </B><BR>
The period during which school is in session, consisting of at least 30 weeks of instructional time. The school year typically runs from the beginning of September through the end of May at most colleges and universities. 
<P>
<B>Access</B><BR>
<em>Access</em> to higher education focuses on providing students with the
opportunity to pursue a college education. <em>Choice</em> focuses on
allowing students the flexibility to choose among several
options. Generally, need-based aid promotes access while merit-based
aid promotes choice. Students with no debt are more likely to pursue
advanced education (4 year instead of 2 year undergraduate, graduate
and professional school) and more likely to pursue public service careers.
<P>
<B>Accrue </B><BR>
To accumulate. 
<P>
<B>Accrual Date</B><BR> 
The date on which interest charges on an educational loan begin to accrue. See also <A HREF="#subsidized">Subsidized Loan</A>. 
<P>
<B>Achievement Tests (SAT II) </B><BR>
A collection of tests that measure the student's proficiency and accumulated knowledge of specific subject areas. Different schools require different achievement tests as part of their admissions requirements. Since March 1994, these tests are now known as the SAT II tests. See also <A HREF="#sat">SAT</A> and <A HREF="#ets">ETS</A>. 
<P>
<B>Adjusted Available Income </B><BR>
In the Federal Methodology, the remaining income after the allowances (taxes and a basic living allowance) have been subtracted. 
<P>
<B>Admit-Deny </B><BR>
A practice in which a school will admit marginal students, but not award them any financial aid. Very few schools use admit-deny, because studies have shown that lack of sufficient financial aid is a key factor in the performance of marginal students. 
<P>
<B>Advanced Placement Test (AP)</B><BR> 
Test used to earn credit for college subjects studied in high school. They are offered by ETS in the spring. AP tests are scored on a scale from 1 to 5 (the best possible score). 
<P>
<B>Adverse Credit History</B><BR>
To be eligible for a PLUS loan, the borrower must not have an
<em>adverse credit history</em>. This is a modest credit check.
According to the regulations at
34 CFR 682.201(c)(2), a borrower is considered to have an adverse
credit history if a recent credit report shows that
<ul>
<li>the borrower has a current delinquency of 90 or more days on any debt, or
<li>the borrower had certain derogatory information (e.g., default
determination, bankruptcy discharge, foreclosure, repossession, tax
lien, wage garnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt) in the credit
history during the five years preceding the date of the credit report
</ul>
Note that the five-year lookback only applies to the derogatory
information; it does not apply to the 90-day delinquency which must be
a current delinquency. 
Note also that the absence of a credit history is not considered an adverse
credit history. 
Only about a fifth to a quarter of borrowers will be found to have an
adverse credit history, meaning that more than three-quarters of
borrowers will be eligible for a PLUS loan. PLUS loans do not use any
kind of a debt-to-income ratio or FICO score, unlike private education
loans. 
<P>
<B>Aggregator</B><BR>
An aggregator is a student who wins many scholarships with a
cumulative value of more than $100,000. Some aggregators have
published books with a theme "I won a gazillion dollars for college
and you can too". Although these books contain some good advice, most
students will not be able to pay for college entirely through
scholarships. Very few students win more than $100,000 in
scholarships, and doing so requires a combination of talent and
luck. More than 90% of students do not receive <em>any</em> private
scholarships, and the average amount received by students who do win
scholarships is approximately $2,000. 
<P>
<B>Alternative Loans </B><BR>
See Private Loans. 
<P>
<B>American College Test (ACT) </B><BR>
One of the two national standardized college entrance examinations used in the US. The other is the SAT. The ACT is widely used in the West and Midwest. Most universities require either the ACT or the SAT as part of an application for admission. See also <A HREF="#plan">PLAN</A>. 
<P>
<B>Amortization</B><BR> 
The process of gradually repaying a loan over an extended period of time through periodic installments of principal and interest. 
<P>
<B>Appeal</B><BR>
A formal request to have a financial aid administrator review your aid eligibility and possibly use Professional Judgment to adjust the figures. For example, if you believe the financial information on your financial aid application does not reflect your family's current ability to pay (e.g., because of death of a parent, unemployment or other unusual circumstances), you should definitely make an appeal. The financial aid administrator may require documentation of the special circumstances or of other information listed on your financial aid application. 
<P>
<B>Asset</B><BR> 
An item of value, such as a family's home, business, and farm equity, real estate, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, cash, certificates of deposit (CDs), bank accounts, trust funds and other property and investments. 
<P>
<B>Asset Protection Allowance</b><BR>
A portion of your parents' assets that are not included in the calculation of the parent contribution, as calculated by the Federal Methodology need analysis formula. The asset protection allowance increases with the age of the parents. 
<P>
<B>Assistantship</B><BR> 
See Graduate Assistantship. 
<P>
<B>Associate Degree</B><BR> 
The degree granted by two-year colleges. 
<P>
<B>Award Letter</B><BR> 
An official document issued by a school's financial aid office that lists all of the financial aid awarded to the student. This letter provides details on their analysis of your financial need and the breakdown of your financial aid package according to amount, source and type of aid. The award letter will include the terms and conditions for the financial aid and information about the cost of attendance. You are required to sign a copy of the letter, indicating whether you accept or decline each source of aid, and return it to the financial aid office. Some schools call the award letter the "Financial Aid Notification (FAN)". 
<P>
<B>Award Year</B><BR> 
The academic year for which financial aid is requested (or
received). The award year runs from July 1 to June 30.
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE="1" CLASS=one><A HREF="#top">Return to top</A></FONT> 
<P>
<A NAME="b"></A>
<B>Bachelor's Degree</B><BR> 
The undergraduate degree granted by four-year colleges and universities. 
<P>
<B>Balloon Payment</b><BR>
A larger than usual payment used to pay off the outstanding balance of a loan without penalty. Not all loans allow balloon payments. Simple interest loans, like many educational loans, generally do allow balloon payments. 
<P>
<B>Bankruptcy</B><BR> 
When a person is declared bankrupt, he is found to be legally insolvent and his property is distributed among his creditors or otherwise administered to satisfy the interests of his creditors. Federal student loans, however, cannot normally be discharged through bankruptcy. 
<P>
<B>Base Year</B><BR> 
The tax year prior to the academic year (award year) for which financial aid is requested. The base year runs from January 1 of the junior year in high school through December 31 of the senior year. Financial information from this year is used to determine eligibility for financial aid. 
<P>

<A NAME="c"></A>
<B>Calendar Year</b><BR>
The calendar year runs from January 1 to December 31.
<P>
<B>Campus-based Aid</b><BR>
Financial aid programs are administered by the university. The federal government provides the university with a fixed annual allocation, which is awarded by the financial aid administrator to deserving students. Such programs include the Perkins Loan, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant and Federal Work-Study. Note that there is no guarantee that every eligible student will receive financial aid through these programs, because the awards are made from a fixed pool of money. This is a key difference between the campus-based loan programs and the Direct Loan Program. Do not confuse the two, even though both loans are issued through the schools. 
<P>
<A NAME="cancellation"></A>
<B>Cancellation</B><BR> 
Loan cancellation ends the obligation to repay the debt and typically
involves the discharge or forgiveness of the loan balance (including
any accrued but unpaid interest). 
While both discharge and forgiveness involve cancellation of the
remaining debt, discharges usually occur for circumstances beyond the
borrower's control and forgiveness for circumstances within the
borrower's control.
Examples of loan discharges include discharges due to bankruptcy,
death or total and permanent disability of the borrower. 
Loan forgiveness programs typically involve a requirement to work in a
particular field, such as working in a public service job, teaching in
a national shortage area or serving in the military.

<P>
<B>Capital Gain</B><BR> 
An increase in the value of an asset such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and real estate between the time the asset was purchased and the time the asset was sold. 
<P>
<B>Capitalization</B><BR> 
The practice of adding unpaid interest charges to the principal balance of an educational loan, thereby increasing the size of the loan. Interest is then charged on the new balance, including both the unpaid principal and the accrued interest. Capitalizing the interest increases the monthly payment and the amount of money you will eventually have to repay. If you can afford to pay the interest as it accrues, you are better off not capitalizing it. Capitalization is sometimes called compounding. See also <A HREF="#unsubsidized">Unsubsidized Loans</A>. 
<P>
<B>Collateral</B><BR> 
Property that is used to secure a loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can seize the collateral. For example, a mortgage is usually secured by the house purchased with the loan. 
<P>
<B>Collection Agency</b><BR>
A company often hired by the lender or guarantee agency to recover defaulted loans. 
<P>
<B>College Board</B><BR> 
A nonprofit educational association of colleges, universities, educational systems and other educational institutions. For more information, see College Board Online (CBO). 
<P>
<B>College Work-Study (CWS)</b><BR>
College Work-Study is simply a part time job. This term is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the Federal Work-Study Program. 
<P>
<a name="color"><B>Color of Federal Forms</B><BR> 
The FAFSA and SAR change color each year in a four color rotation:
Yellow (2007-2008), Orange (2008-2009), Green (2009-2010), and Blue
(2010-2011), then it repeats. (Orange is replacing Pink starting in
2008-2009. Previously the color
rotation was Yellow (2003-04), Pink (2004-05),
Green (2005-06), and Blue (2006-07).)
This will help you make sure you're filing the
correct form. Purple has been the stable parent color since 1999-2000.

<p>
<b>Commercial Paper Rate (CP)</b><br>
Commercial paper is an unsecured short-term debt issued by
corporations and banks with good credit. Maturities are typically less
than one year. The instruments are negotiable and are typically issued
at a discount to face value instead of bearing interest. They are used
by companies to manage short-term cash flow needs. The Commercial
Paper Rate is an industry average rate for such instruments.

<P>
<b>Common Law Marriage</b><br>
If a couple cohabits while holding themselves out as being married,
they are considered to be married in 
<a href="/educators/commonlaw.phtml">16 states</a>.
<p>
<b>Community Property</b><br>
Community property laws specify that property is owned jointly by
husband and wife unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary
(i.e., prenuptial agreements). According to <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p555.pdf">IRS Publication</a> 555, the
following is a list of Community Property states: Arizona, California,
Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and
Wisconsin. In addition, Alaska has community property laws.
<p>
<B>Commuter Student</B><BR> 
A student who lives at home and commutes to school every day. 
<P>
<B>Compounded Interest</B><BR> 
Interest that is paid on both the principal balance of the loan and on any accrued (unpaid) interest. Capitalizing the interest on an unsubsidized Stafford loan is a form of compounding. 
<P>
<a name="consolidation"><B>Consolidation Loan</B><BR> 
Also called Loan Consolidation, a consolidation loan combines several
student loans into one bigger loan from a single lender. The
consolidation loan is like a refinance and is used to pay off the
balances on the other loans. The primary intention is to replace multiple
loans with a single "consolidated" loan to simplify repayment. For
federal student loans a consolidation loan can also provide access to
alternate repayment terms and the ability to lock in a rate on older
variable rate student loans. For private student loans a consolidation
loan can also offer the opportunity to get a better interest rate or
release a cosigner if the borrower's credit score has improved
significantly. 

<P>
<B>Cooperative Education</B><BR> 
A program where the student spends time engaged in employment related to their major in addition to regular classroom study. 
<P>
<B>Cosigner</B><BR> 
A cosigner on a loan is a coborrower and is obligated
to repay the debt if the primary borrower defaults on the
debt. Repayment activity is reported on both the borrower's and
cosigner's credit histories. A cosigner is often required if the
borrower's credit history is bad or marginal or thin.
<P>
<B>Cost of Attendance (COA)</B><BR>
(Also known as the cost of education or "budget") The total amount it should cost the student to go to school, including tuition and fees, room and board, allowances for books and supplies, transportation, and personal and incidental expenses. Loan fees, if applicable, may also be included in the COA. Child care and expenses for disabilities may also be included at the discretion of the financial aid administrator. Schools establish different standard budget amounts for students living on-campus and off-campus, married and unmarried students and in-state and out-of-state students. 

<p>
<b>Credit History</b><br>
A credit history is a record of all events connected with payment of a
set of debts, such as on-time payments, late payments, nonpayment,
default, liens and bankruptcy discharge. It can include both current
and previous credit accounts and their balances, employment and
personal information, and a history of past credit problems.

<p>
<b>Credit Score</b><br>
Also referred to as a credit rating, a credit score is a measure of
the likelihood of a borrower paying back a debt according to the
agreement. It is based on the borrower's credit history. Credit
bureaus and credit reporting agencies provide this information to
banks and businesses to help them decide whether to issue a loan or
extend credit.
<P>
People who make all their payments on time are considered good credit
risks. People who are frequently delinquent in making their payments
are considered bad credit risks. Defaulting on a loan can hurt your
credit rating. It is difficult to get a good credit score, but very
easy to ruin it.
<p>
The most commonly used credit score
is the FICO score established by Fair Isaac Corporation on a scale
from 350 to 850. Higher credit scores are better. 

<p>
<b>Credit Underwriting Criteria</b><br>
A lender's decisions about the extension of credit to a borrower are
based on a set of credit underwriting criteria. While most lenders
rely on credit scores, they may also rely on other criteria such as
debt-to-income ratios, minimum income requirements, minimum employment
history duration, exclusions for specified derogatory information in
the credit history (e.g., a bankruptcy in the last 7 or 10 years) and
volatile income (e.g., self employment).

<P>
<B>Custodial Parent</B><BR> 
If a student's parents are divorced or separated, the custodial parent is the one with whom the student lived the most during the past 12 months. The student's need analysis is based on financial information supplied by the custodial parent. 
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA" SIZE="1" CLASS=one><A HREF="#top">Return to top</A></FONT> 
<P>

<A NAME="d"></A>
<b>Debt-to-Income Ratio</b><br>
A debt-to-income ratio is the ratio of total debt to the borrower's
income. It is generally a good ballpark measure of the borrower's
ability to repay the debt. If the debt-to-income ratio is less than 1,
the borrower should be able to afford to repay the debt. If the
debt-to-income ratio is more than 2, the borrower will have
significant difficult repaying the debt and may be at high risk of
default. Borrowers with higher incomes, however, may be able to repay
a debt despite a high debt-to-income ratio since more of their income
is often disposable and not required to pay for basic
necessities. Lenders these days are more likely to rely on the
debt-service-to-income ratio, which is the ratio of the normal monthly
payments on the borrower's loans to the borrower's gross monthly
income. This measure takes into account the ability of a borrower to
make a loan more affordable by increasing the loan term so that the
monthly payments are lower.

<p>
<a name="default"></a>
<B>Default</B><BR> 
A loan is in default when the borrower fails to pay several regular
installments on time or otherwise fails to meet the terms and
conditions of the loan. For example, a borrower who is 120 days late
on a private student loan or 270 days late on federal education loan
is considered to be in default. When a borrower is in default the loan
becomes due in full immediately and the lender may pursue more
aggressive collection techniques, such as sending the account to a
collection agency or filing suit against the borrower. If you default
on a loan, the university, the holder of the loan, the state
government and the federal government can take legal action to recover
the money, including garnishing your wages and withholding income tax
refunds. Defaulting on a government loan will make you ineligible for
future federal financial aid, unless a satisfactory repayment schedule
is arranged, and can affect your credit rating.

<P>
<B>Default Fee</B><BR> 
Synonymous with <A HREF="#guarantee">Guarantee Fee</A>. 

<P>
<B>Deferment</B><BR> 
Occurs when a borrower is allowed to postpone repaying the loan. If you have a subsidized loan, the federal government pays the interest charges during the deferment period. If you have an unsubsidized loan, you are responsible for the interest that accrues during the deferment period. You can still postpone paying the interest charges by capitalizing the interest, which increases the size of the loan. Most federal loan programs allow students to defer their loans while they are in school at least half time. If you don't qualify for a deferment, you may be able to get a forbearance. You can't get a deferment if your loan is in default. 

<P>
<B>Delinquent</B><BR> 
If the borrower fails to make a payment on time, the borrower is
considered delinquent and late fees may be charged. If the borrower
misses several payments, the loan goes into <a href="#default">default</a>.  

<P>
<A NAME="dependency status"></A>
<B>Dependency Status</B><BR> 
Determines to what degree a student has access to parent financial resources. 

<P>
<A NAME="dependent"></A>
<B>Dependent</B><BR> 
For a child or other person to be considered your dependent, they must live with you and you must provide them with more than half of their support. Spouses do not count as dependents in the Federal Methodology. You and your spouse cannot both claim the same child as a dependent. (See also <A HREF="#independent">Independent</A>.)

<P>
<B>Direct Loans</B><BR> 
The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (aka the Direct Loan Program) is a federal program where the school becomes the lending agency and manages the funds directly, with the federal government providing the loan funds. Not all schools currently participate in this program. Benefits of the program include a faster turnaround time and less bureaucracy than the old "bank loan" program. The terms for Direct Loans are the same as for the Stafford Loan program. For more information about Direct Loans, contact the Direct Loan Servicing Center at 1-800-848-0979. 

<P>
<B>Disbursement</B><BR> 
Disbursement is the release of loan funds to the school for delivery
to the borrower. The payment will be made co-payable to the student
and the school. Loan funds are first credited to the student's account
for payment of tuition, fees, room and board and other school
charges. Any excess funds are then paid to the student in cash or by
check. Unless the loan amount is under $500 or the college has a low
default rate, the disbursement will be made in at least two equal
installments. 

<P>
<a name="discharge">
<B>Discharge</B><BR> 
A loan discharge releases the borrower from his or her obligation to
repay the loan, 
usually due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control. 
Both discharge and <A HREF="#forgiveness">forgiveness</A> are types of
<A HREF="#cancellation">loan cancellation</A>.

<P>
<B>Disclosure Statement</B><BR> 
Provides the borrower with information about the actual cost of the loan, including the interest rate, origination, insurance, loan fees and any other types of finance charges. Lenders are required to provide the borrower with a disclosure statement before issuing a loan.

<B>Due Diligence</B><BR> 
If a borrower fails to make payments on their loan according to the terms of the promissory note, the federal government requires the lender, holder or servicer of the loan to make frequent attempts to contact the borrower (via telephone and mail) to encourage him or her to repay the loan and make arrangements to resolve the delinquency.

<B>Early Action</B><BR> 
A program with earlier deadlines and earlier notification dates than the regular admissions process. Students who apply to an early action program do not commit to attending the school if admitted, unlike an early decision program. Ivy League schools do not allow you to apply to more than one Ivy early action. 
<P>
<B>Early Admission</B><BR> 
A program that allows gifted high school juniors to skip their senior year and enroll instead in college. The term "Early Admission" is sometimes used to refer collectively to Early Action and Early Decision programs. 
<P>
<B>Early Decision</b><BR>
A program with earlier deadlines and earlier notification dates than the regular admissions process. Students who apply to an early decision program commit to attending the school if admitted (thus, early decision can be applied to only one school). Unfortunately, this means the student has accepted the offer of admission before they find out about the financial aid package. You should only participate in an early decision program if the school is your first choice and you won't want to consider other schools. 
<P>
<B>Electronic Data Exchange (EDE)</B><BR>

<P>
<B>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)</B><BR>
Used by some schools and lenders to wire funds for Stafford and PLUS loans directly to participating schools without requiring an intermediate check for the student to endorse. The money is transferred electronically instead of using paper, and hence is available to the student sooner. If you have a choice of funds transfer methods, use EFT. 
<P>
<B>Electronic Student Aid Report</B><BR> 
An electronic form of the Student Aid Report. 
<P>
<B>Eligible Non-Citizen</b><BR>
Someone who is not a US citizen but is nevertheless eligible for Federal student aid. Eligible non-citizens include US permanent residents who are holders of valid green cards, US nationals, holders of form I-94 who have been granted refugee or asylum status and certain other non-citizens. Non-citizens who hold a student visa or an exchange visitor visa are not eligible for Federal student aid. 
<P>
<B>Emancipated</B><BR> 
To release a child from the control of a parent or guardian. Declaring a child to be legally emancipated is not sufficient to release the parents or legal guardians from being responsible for providing for the child's education. If this were the case, then every parent would "divorce" their children before sending them to college. The criteria for a child to be found independent are much stricter. See <a href="#dependency status">Dependency Status</a>. 
<P>
<B>Endowment</B><BR> 
Funds owned by an institution and invested to produce income to support the operation of the institution. Many educational institutions use a portion of their endowment income for financial aid. A school with a larger ratio of endowment per student is more likely to give larger financial aid packages. 
<P>
<B>Enrollment Status</B><BR> 
An indication of whether you are a full-time or part-time student. Generally you must be enrolled at least half-time (and  in some cases full-time) to qualify for financial aid.

Under ELO, some schools can offer higher annual and cumulative loan limits to students
receiving the Perkins Loan. The ELO is restricted to schools with a Perkins Loan default rate of 15% or less. 
<P>
<B>Expected Family Contribution (EFC)</B><BR>
The amount of money that the family is expected to be able to contribute to the student's education, as determined by the Federal Methodology need analysis formula approved by Congress. The EFC includes the parent contribution and the student contribution, and depends on the student's dependency status, family size, number of family members in school, taxable and nontaxable income and assets. The difference between the COA and the EFC is the student's financial need, and is used in determining the student's eligibility for need-based financial aid. If you have unusual financial circumstances (such as high medical expenses, loss of employment or death of a parent) that may affect your ability to pay for your education, tell your financial aid administrator (FAA). He or she can adjust the COA or EFC to compensate. See Professional Judgment.

<B>Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP)</B><BR> 
Similar to the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The funds for these loans are provided by the US government directly to students and their parents through their schools. Benefits of the program include a faster turn-around time and less bureaucracy than the old "bank loan" program. The FDSLP includes the Federal Direct Stafford Loan (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and the Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). 
<P>
<B>Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP)</B><BR> 
FFELP is one of two parallel federal education loan programs. The
other is the Direct Loan program. Both offer the same sets of loans
(e.g., Stafford, PLUS and Consolidation loans) with only slight
differences. The main difference is in the source of funds. In the
FFEL program the funds normally come from private capital such as
banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, while in
the Direct Loan program the funds come from the US Treasury through
the US Department of Education. The federal government guarantees
FFELP loans against borrower default and ensures that the lenders
receive a market rate of return on the loans despite the lower
interest rates paid by borrowers of education loans.

<B>Federal Methodology</B><BR> 
The need analysis formula used to determine the EFC. The Federal Methodology takes
family size, the number of family members in college, taxable and nontaxable income and assets into account. Unlike most Institutional Methodologies, however, the Federal Methodology does not consider the net value of the family residence. 
<P>
<B>Federal Processor</B><BR> 
The organization that processes the information submitted on the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA) and uses it to compute eligibility for federal student aid. There are two different federal processors serving specific geographic regions. 
<P>
<B>Federal Work-Study (FWS)</B><BR>
Program providing undergraduate and graduate students with part-time employment during the school year. The federal government pays a portion of the student's salary, making it cheaper for departments and businesses to hire the student. For this reason, work-study students often find it easier to get a part-time job. Eligibility for FWS is based on need. Money earned from a FWS job is not counted as income for the subsequent year's need analysis process. 
<P>
<B>Fellowship</B><BR> 
A form of aid given to graduate students to help support their education. Some fellowships include a tuition waiver or a payment to the university in lieu of tuition. Most fellowships include a stipend to cover reasonable living expenses (e.g., just above the <a href="#povertyline">poverty line</a>). Fellowships are a form of gift aid and do not have to be repaid. 
<P>
<a name="FinancialAid"><B>Financial Aid</B></a><BR>

<B>Financial Aid Administrator (FAA)</B><BR>
A college or university employee who is involved in the administration of financial aid. Some schools call FAAs "Financial Aid Advisors" or "Financial Aid Counselors". 
<P>
<B>Financial Aid Form (FAF)</b><BR>
The old name for the Financial Aid PROFILE. The Financial Aid PROFILE is a supplemental financial aid form processed by the College Scholarship Service (CSS).

<P>
<B>Financial Aid Package</B><BR> 
The complete collection of grants, scholarships, loans and work-study employment from all sources (federal, state, institutional and private) offered to a student to enable them to attend the college or university. Note that unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS loans are not considered part of the financial aid package, since these financing options are available to the family to help them meet the EFC. 
<P>
<B>Financial Aid Transcript (FAT)</B><BR>
A record of all federal aid received by the student at each school attended. If you have previously attended an institution of higher education and are now applying for financial aid from the different university, the university will require a FAT from each of the schools previously attended, regardless of whether aid was received or not. They are required to do this by federal law. You have to submit a FAT even if you were in high school at
the time. An electronic FAT process will be in place soon which will eliminate the need for the student to submit a FAT. The FAT is not the same as an academic transcript. 
<P>

<P>
<B>First-Time Borrower</B><BR> 
A first-year undergraduate student who has no unpaid loan balances outstanding on the date he or she signs a promissory note for an educational loan. First-time borrowers may be subjected to a delay in the disbursement of the loan funds. The first loan payment is disbursed 30 days after the first day of the enrollment period. If the student withdraws during the first 30 days of classes, the loan is canceled and does not need to be repaid. Borrowers with existing loan balances aren't subject to this delay. 
<P>
<B>Fiscal Year</B><BR> 
The federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30.
<P>
<B>Fixed Rate</B><BR> 
A fixed rate is an interest rate that does not
change and remains the same for the life of the loan.
<P>
<B>Forbearance</B><BR> 
During a forbearance the lender allows the borrower to temporarily postpone repaying the principal, but the interest charges continue to accrue, even on subsidized loans. The borrower must continue paying the interest charges during the forbearance period. Forbearances are granted at the lender's discretion, usually in cases of extreme financial hardship or other unusual circumstances when the borrower does not qualify for a deferment. You can't receive a forbearance if your loan is in default. 
<p>
<b>Foreclosure</b><br>
A foreclosure is a legal proceeding in which a lender obtains title to
the collateral the backed a defaulted loan. The lender then sells the
collateral to pay off the debt.  The term is most often used in
reference to taking possession of a home that secured a defaulted
mortgage.
<p>
<a name="forgiveness">
<B>Forgiveness</B><BR> 
Loan forgiveness releases the borrower from his or her obligation to
repay the loan, usually due to circumstances within the borrower's
control. The most common loan forgiveness programs cancel all or part
of the debt for working in a particular field or performing military
or volunteer service. Loan forgiveness for working in a particular
occupation is tax-free, while other types of loan forgiveness may
result in a tax liability.
There are two main types of loan forgiveness: up front and back
end. Up front loan forgiveness cancels a portion of the debt for each
year of service. Back end loan forgiveness cancels any remaining debt
after a specified number of years of service. 
Both <A HREF="#discharge">discharge</a> and forgiveness are types of

The PLUS Loans do not have a grace period. 
<P>
<B>Grade Point Average (GPA)</B><BR>

<B>Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL)</B><BR>
A loan administered by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It was available to medical school students pursuing medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry, clinical psychology, health administration and public health. Undergraduate pharmacology students were also eligible. New HEAL loans to student borrowers were discontinued as of September 30, 1998. (The HEAL program was replaced with higher unsubsidized Stafford loan limits. Students enrolled in certain health profession programs are eligible to borrow an additional unsubsidized Stafford of $20,000 per year and have an aggregate Stafford loan limit (combined subsidized plus unsubsidized) of $224,000.)
<P>
<B>Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL)</B><BR>
A low interest loan administered by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is now known as the Primary Care Loan (PCL). 
<P>
<B>Holder</B><BR> 
A holder of a loan is the lender that currently holds legal title to
the loan and is entitled to the payments of principal and
interest. Since loans may periodically be sold to a different lender,
the current holder of a loan may not necessarily be the lender that
originated the loan.  The holder may be the bank that issued the loan,
a secondary market that purchased the loan from the bank or a
guarantee agency if the borrower defaulted on the loan.  When a loan
is sold, the servicer may also change, which may require the borrower
to send payments to a different address.

<P>
<B>Home Equity</B><BR> 
Current market value of a home less the mortgage's remaining unpaid principal. It is based on the market value, not the insurance or tax value. For a conservative estimate of your home's market value, try using the Federal Housing Index Calculator. See also <A HREF="#equity">Equity</A>.

<P>
<B>Interest</b><BR>
The interest on a loan is a fee charged periodically in exchange for
the use of a lender's money. It is paid in addition to repaying the
amount borrowed.  Interest is usually calculated as a percentage of
the outstanding principal balance of the loan. The percentage rate may
be fixed for the life of the loan, or it may be variable, depending on
the terms of the loan.  Except for consolidation loans, federal
education loans issued from October 1992 to June 2006 used variable
interest rates that are pegged to the cost of US Treasury Bills. Since
July 1, 2006 all federal education loans have involved fixed interest
rates.

Federal agency responsible for enforcing US tax laws and collecting taxes. 
<P>
<B>Internship</B><BR> 
Part-time job during the academic year or the summer months in which a student receives supervised practical training in a their field.

<b>Lender Subsidies</b><br>
Lender subsidies is a term used colloquially
to refer to a set of arrangements established to encourage lenders to
make federally-guaranteed education loans. These include a federal
guarantee against borrower default, special allowance payments and
lender-paid origination fees.

<P>
<B>Leveraging</B><BR> 
If a school offers a talented student extra financial aid, regardless of need, the student is more likely to enroll. Leveraging is the controversial practice of figuring out how much it will take to attract such students and customizing aid offers to optimize the quality of the incoming class. 

<p>
<b>LIBOR</b><br>
The LIBOR index, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is a
variable rate index that typically reflects the rates financial
institutions charge each other for short-term loans.

<P>
<B>Life-of-Loan Servicing</B><BR>
The company that services the loan (the source of customer service
interaction with the borrower) does not change for the life of the
loan. Life-of-loan servicing is not a guarantee that the loan will not
be sold from one lender to another, but rather that the same servicer
will be used by the lender that acquires the loans.
<P>
<B>Line of Credit</b><BR>

A discount is a reduction in the interest rates and/or fees paid on a
loan.  Federal law sets the maximum interest rates and fees charged on
Stafford, PLUS and Consolidation loans. Nothing prevents lenders from
offering lower interest rates and fees. Many lenders offer a variety
of convoluted loan discounts, sometimes called borrower benefits, in
order to attract potential borrowers. Loan discounts may be contingent
on specific borrower behavior, such as repaying the loan through
direct debit from the borrower's bank account (ACH) or making a number
of consecutive payments on time.

<P>
<B>Mortgage</B><BR> 
A mortgage is a legal agreement to conditionally convey a security
interest in property as collateral for repaying a loan. The property
is pledged as collateral on the loan. It is used in connection with a

<B>Need Analysis</b><BR>
The process of determining a student's financial need by analyzing the financial information provided by the student and his or her parents (and spouse, if any) on a financial aid form. The student must submit a need analysis form to apply for need-based aid. Need analysis forms include the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the Financial Aid PROFILE. 
<P>
<B>Need-Based</b><BR>
Financial aid that is need-based depends on your financial situation. Most government sources of financial aid are need-based. 
<P>
<B>Need-Blind</B><BR> 
Under need-blind admissions, the school decides whether to make an offer of admission to a student without considering the student's financial situation. Most schools use a need-blind admissions process. A few schools will use financial need to decide whether to include marginal students in the wait list. 
<P>
<B>Need-Sensitive</B><BR> 
Under need-sensitive admissions, the school does take the student's financial situation into account when deciding whether to admit him or her. Some schools use need-sensitive admissions when deciding to accept a borderline student or to pull a student off of the waiting list. 
<P>
<B>Net Cost</B><BR> 
Net cost is the difference between the cost of attendance and the need-based financial aid package. It is generally similar to the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) except when the college practices gapping. It does not vary much from college to college. See Out-of-Pocket Cost for a related definition. Generally, families should evaluate college financial aid award letters using out-of-pocket cost, not net cost.

<b>Originate</b><br>
A lender is said to originate or make a loan when
the loan is disbursed to or on behalf of the borrower. 
<p>
<B>Origination Fee</B><BR> 
Fee paid to the bank to compensate them for the cost of administering the loan. The origination fees are charged as the loan is disbursed, and typically run to 3% of the amount disbursed. A portion of this fee is paid to federal government to offset the administrative costs of the loan. 
<P>
<B>Out-of-Pocket Cost</B><BR> 
Out-of-Pocket cost is the difference between the cost of attendance and just the grants and scholarships and other gift aid in the need-based financial aid package. It reflects the bottom line cost to the family, the amount the family will need to pay out of current and future resources, such as savings, income and loans. See Net Cost for a related definition. While net cost does not vary by much from college to college, out-of-pocket cost can vary significantly, based on how much of need is met with grants instead of loans. Some of the elite non-profit colleges that have adopted no loans financial aid policies have lower out-of-pocket costs than many public colleges. Generally, families should evaluate college financial aid award letters using out-of-pocket cost, not net cost.

<B>Parent Contribution (PC)</B><BR>
An estimate of the portion of your educational expenses that the federal government
believes your parents can afford. It is based on their income, the number of parents earning income, assets, family size, the number of family members currently attending a university and other relevant factors. Students who qualify as independent are not expected to have a parent contribution. 
<P>
<B>Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)</B><BR>
Federal loans available to parents of dependent undergraduate students to help finance the child's education. Parents may borrow up to the full cost of their children's education, less the amount of any other financial aid received. PLUS Loans may be used to pay the EFC. There is a minimal credit check required for the PLUS loan, so a good credit history is required. Check with your local bank to see if they participate in the PLUS loan program. If your application for a PLUS loan is turned down, your child may be eligible to borrow additional money under the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan program. 

<p>
<b>Payoff Amount</b><br>
The payoff amount is the amount required to pay
off a loan in full. It typically includes the outstanding principal
plus any accrued but unpaid interest, as well as any unpaid late fees
and collection charges.

<P>
<B>Pell Grant</b><BR>
A federal grant that provides funds of up to $5,550 (2010-11) based on the student's financial need. 
<P>
<B>Perkins Loan</b><BR>
Formerly the National Direct Student Loan Program, the Perkins Loan allows students to borrow up to $3,000/year (5 year max) for undergraduate school and $5,000/year for graduate school (6 year max). The Perkins Loan has one of the lowest interest rates and is awarded by the financial aid administrator to students with exceptional financial need. The student must have applied for a Pell Grant to be eligible. The interest on the Perkins Loan is subsidized while the student is in school.

<a name="povertyline" href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/"><b>Poverty Line</b></a><br>
The <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/">poverty guidelines</a>,
often referred to as the poverty line, are published annually by the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). They represent a
simplification of the 
<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld.html">poverty thresholds</a>
published annually by the US Census Bureau. The poverty line is more
often used in federal student aid, such as the 
<a href="#IBR">income-based repayment</a> and
<a href="#ICR">income-contingent repayment</a> plans, as well as the
economic hardship deferment.
<P>
<B>Prepaid Tuition Plan</B><BR> 
A college savings plan that is guaranteed to rise in value at the same rate as college tuition. For example, if a family purchases shares that are worth half a year's tuition at a state college, they will always be worth half a year's tuition, even 10 years later when tuition rates will have doubled. 
<P>
<B>Prepayment</B><BR> 
Prepayment is paying off all or part of a loan before it is due. 
<P>
<B>Prepayment Penalty</B><BR> 
A prepayment penalty is a fee charged for early payoff of a loan. No
federal or private education loans charge prepayment penalties.
<P>
<B>Primary Care Loan (PCL)</B><BR>
A low interest loan administered by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It is available to medical school students pursuing medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry and podiatry. Undergraduate pharmacology students are also eligible. To be eligible for this loan, you must commit to working in the field of primary care. It was formerly known as the Health Professions Student Loan (HPSL). 

<p>
<b>Prime</b><br>
Prime borrowers have good to excellent credit histories,
typically with a FICO score of 650 or more.

<p>
<b>Prime Lending Rate</b><br>
The Prime Lending Rate is the interest rate
offered by lenders to their best credit customers. 

<P>
<B>Principal</B><BR> 
The principal or loan balance is the amount of money borrowed or
remaining unpaid on a loan. Interest is charged as a percentage of the
principal. Insurance and origination fees will be deducted from this
amount before disbursement.

<P>

<P>
<B>Professional Judgment (PJ)</B><BR>
For need-based federal aid programs, the financial aid administrator can adjust the EFC, adjust the COA, or change the dependency status (with documentation) when extenuating circumstances exist. For example, if a parent becomes unemployed, disabled or deceased, the FAA can decide to use estimated income information for the award year instead of the actual income figures from the base year. This delegation of authority from the federal government to the financial aid administrator is called Professional Judgment (PJ). 
<P>
<B>Professional Student</b><BR>
A student pursuing advanced study in law or medicine. 
<P>
<B>Promissory Note</B><BR> 
A promissory note (or 'note') is a binding legal document that must be
signed by the student borrower before loan funds are disbursed by the
lender. The promissory note states the terms and conditions of the
loan, including repayment schedule (e.g., level monthly payments for a
term of 10 years), interest rate, fees (e.g., origination fees,
guarantee fees, late fees, collection charges), deferments, forbearances
and cancellations. It represents an agreement by the borrower to repay
the debt according to the specified terms and conditions. The student
should keep this document until the loan has been repaid.  
<P>

<B>Reaching School</B><BR> 
A school that the student would love to attend, but which isn't "guaranteed" to admit you. Every student should apply to at least one reaching school. (See also <A HREF="#s">Safety School</A>.)
<P>
<B>Renewable Scholarships</b><BR>
A scholarship that is awarded for more than one year. Usually the student must maintain certain academic standards to be eligible for subsequent years of the award. Some renewable scholarships will require the student to reapply for the scholarship each year; others will just require a report on the student's progress to a degree. 
<P>
<B>Repayment Schedule</B><BR> 
The repayment schedule discloses the monthly payment, interest rate, total repayment obligation, payment due dates and the term of the loan. 
<P>
<B>Repayment Term</b><BR>
The term of a loan is the period during which the borrower is required to make payments on his or her loans. When the payments are made monthly, the term is usually given as a number of payments or years. 

<p>
<b>Repossession</b><br>
Repossession occurs when a lender takes physical
control of the collateral for a loan. It can also refer to taking
posession of an item that was rented or leased. The term is most often
used in connection with automobiles. It is similar in concept to a
foreclosure, but the focus is on recovering goods sold on credit or an
installment contract. 

<P>
<B>Research Assistantship (RA)</B><BR> 
A form of financial aid awarded to graduate students to help support their education. Research assistantships usually provide the graduate student with a waiver of all or part of tuition, plus a small stipend for living expenses. As the name implies, an RA is required to perform research duties. Sometimes these duties are strongly tied to the student's eventual thesis topic. 
<p>
<b>Reset</b><br>
A variable interest rate is said to 'reset' when it
changes. When the interest rate resets the variable interest rate
formula is used with the current index rates to set a new interest
rate until the next reset. 

<p>
<b>Return</b><br>
Return is the opportunity for potential gains on an investment.

<p>
<b>Risk</b><br>
Risk is exposure to potential loss on an investment.

<B>Safety School</b><BR>
A school that will almost certainly admit the student. The college admissions process is not predictable. Even "sure admits" are sometimes rejected. Some students are admitted to all the schools to which they apply; others are rejected by all the schools. To protect yourself against the latter scenario, you should apply to at least one safety school.  (See also <A HREF="#reaching">Reaching School</A>.)
<P>
<B>Sallie Mae</b><BR>
(Formerly known as SLMA or the Student Loan Marketing Association) The nation's largest secondary market and holds approximately one third of all educational loans. 
<P>
<B>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)</B><BR>
A student must make this in order to continue receiving federal aid. If a student fails to maintain an academic standing consistent with the school's SAP policy, they are unlikely to meet the school's graduation requirements. 
<P>
<B>Scholarship</B><BR> 
A form of financial aid given to undergraduate students to help pay for their education. Most scholarships are restricted to paying all or part of tuition expenses, though some scholarships also cover room and board. Scholarships are a form of gift aid and do not have to be repaid. Many scholarships are restricted to students in specific courses of study or with academic, athletic or artistic talent. 
<P>
<B>Scholarship Search Service</B><BR> 
A service that charges a fee to compare the student's profile against a database of scholarship programs. Few students who use a scholarship search service actually win a scholarship. 
There are several high quality <a href="/scholarships/">scholarship search services</a> available
on the web for free.
<P>
<A NAME="sat"></A>
<B>Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)</B><BR> 
One of the two national standardized college entrance examinations used in the US. The other is the ACT. The SAT (previously known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test) is administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). Most universities require either the ACT or the SAT as part of an application for admission. 
<P>
<B>Secondary Market</B><BR> 
An organization that buys loans from lenders, thereby providing the lender with the capital to issue new loans. Selling loans is a common practice among lenders, so the bank you make your payments to may change during the life of the loan. The terms and conditions of your loan do not change when it is sold to another holder. Sallie Mae is the nation's largest secondary market and holds approximately one third of all educational loans. 
<P>
<B>Secured Loan</B><BR> 
A secured loan is a loan backed by collateral. If the borrower fails
to repay the loan as per the agreement, the lender may take ownership
of the collateral and sell it to repay the loan. Auto loans and home
mortgages are examples of secured loans. Educational loans are
generally not secured.  
<P>
<B>Selective Service</B><BR> 
Registration for the military draft. Male students who are US citizens and have reached the age of 18 and were born after December 31, 1959 must be registered with Selective Service to be eligible for federal financial aid. If the student did not register and is past the age of doing so (18-25), and the school determines that the failure to register was knowing and willful, the student is ineligible for all federal student financial aid programs. The school's decision as to whether the failure to register was willful is not subject to appeal. Students needing help resolving problems concerning their Selective Service registration should call 1-847-688-6888. 
<P>
<B>Self Help Aid</b><BR>
Financial aid in the form of loans and student employment. If every financial aid package is required to include a minimum amount of self-help aid before any gift aid is granted, that level is known as the self-help level. For example, the self-help level will be $8,150 at MIT in 1995-96 (The Tech, March 7, 1995, Vol. 115, No. 9, Page 1). MIT has one of the highest self-help levels of private colleges and universities, with an average self-help level of around $5,500 at the more expensive schools. 
<P>
<B>Service Academy</B><BR> 
The US Air Force Academy, US Coast Guard Academy, US Merchant Marine Academy, US Military Academy and US Naval Academy. Admissions is highly selective, as students must be nominated by their Congressional Representative in order to apply. 
<P>
<B>Servicer</B><BR> 
A servicer is a business that collects payments on a loan and performs
other administrative tasks associated with maintaining a loan
portfolio. Loan servicers disburse loans funds, monitor loans while
the borrowers are in school, update borrower contact information, send
out bills and statements, collect payments, process deferments and
forbearances, respond to borrower inquiries and ensure that the loans
are administered in compliance with federal regulations and guarantee
agency requirements.
Servicers are usually paid either on a unit cost basis
(i.e., a fixed fee per borrower per month) or on a percentage of loan
volume basis (i.e., one-twelfth of 0.50% or 0.90% of the average loan
volume per month).

<P>
<B>Simple Interest</B><BR> 
Interest that is paid only on the principal balance of the loan and not on any accrued interest. Most federal student loan programs offer simple interest. Note, however, that capitalizing the interest on an unsubsidized Stafford loan is a form of compounded interest. 
<P>
<B>Simplified Needs Test</b><BR>
If the parents have an adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 and every family member was eligible to file an IRS Form 1040A or 1040EZ (or wasn't required to file a Federal income tax return), the Federal Methodology ignores assets when computing the EFC. If you filed a 1040 but weren't required to do so, you may be eligible for the simplified needs test. Details on the eligibility requirements appear on the Simplified Needs Test Chart. (Please note that starting in 2004, the AGI threshold for IRS
Form 1040A and IRS Form 1040EZ changed from $50,000 to
$100,000. Nevertheless, a threshold of $50,000 is still used for the
simplified needs test.)
<p>
<b>Special Allowance Payments (SAP)</b><br>
Special allowance payments
were originally established to ensure that education lenders received
a market rate of return on federal education loans. Whenever the
borrower interest rate on the federal education loans fell below
market rates, the US Department of Education would make special
allowance payments to the lenders based on the difference between the
interest rates. In effect, the lenders would receive the higher of the
two interest rates. The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005,
however, severed the connection between borrower interest rates and
the SAP interest rates so that the lenders would only receive the
SAP interest rates regardless of the interest rate paid by the
borrowers. If the interest paid by the borrowers exceeded the SAP, the
lender would rebate the difference to the US Department of
Education. If the interest paid by the borrowers was less than the
SAP, the US Department of Education would pay the difference to the
lenders.  


<P>
<B>Stafford Loans</B><BR> 
Federal loans that come in two forms, subsidized and unsubsidized. Subsidized loans are based on need; unsubsidized loans aren't. The interest on the subsidized Stafford Loan is paid by the federal government while the student is in school and during the 6 month grace period. The Subsidized Stafford Loan was formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL). The Unsubsidized Stafford Loan may be used to pay the EFC. 
<P>
Undergraduates may borrow up to $31,000 ($5,500 during the freshman
year, $6,500 during the sophomore year and $7,500 during the third,
fourth and fifth years) no more than $23,000 of which may be
subsidized ($3,500 during the freshman year, $4,500 during the
sophomore year and $5,500 during the third, fourth and fifth years)
and graduate students up to $65,500 including any undergraduate
Stafford loans ($20,500 per year, no more than $8,500 of which may be
subsidized). The difference between the subsidized 
loan amount and the unsubsidized limit may be borrowed by the student as an
unsubsidized loan.  
<P>
Higher unsubsidized Stafford loan limits are available to independent
students, dependent students whose parents were unable to obtain a
PLUS Loan and graduate/professional students. Undergraduates may
borrow up to $57,500 ($9,500 during the freshman year, $10,500 during
the sophomore year and $12,500 during each subsequent year) and
graduate students up to $138,500 including any undergraduate Stafford
loans ($20,500 per year). These limits are for subsidized and
unsubsidized loans combined. The amounts of any subsidized loans are
still subject to the lower limits for dependent students.  
Certain medical school students may borrow an aggregate amount of $224,000.

<B>Student Aid Report (SAR)</B><BR>
Report that summarizes the information included in the FAFSA and must be provided to your school's FAO. The SAR will also indicate the amount of Pell Grant eligibility, if any, and the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). You should receive a copy of your SAR four to six weeks after you file your FAFSA. Review your SAR and correct any errors on part 2 of the SAR. Keep a photocopy of the SAR for your records. To request a duplicate copy of your SAR, call 1-319-337-5665. 
<P>
<B>Student Contribution</B><BR> 
The amount of money the federal government expects the student to contribute to his
or her education and is included as part of the EFC. The SC depends on the student's income and assets, but can vary from school to school. Usually a student is expected to contribute about 20% of his or her savings and approximately one-half of his summer earnings above $3,000.

<B>Unmet Need</b><BR>
In an ideal world, the FAO would be able to provide each student with the full difference between their ability to pay and the cost of education. Due to budget constraints the FAO may provide the student with less than the student's need (as determined by the FAO). This gap is known as the unmet need. 
<P>
<B>Unsecured Loan</B><BR> 
A loan not backed by collateral, representing a greater risk to the lender. The lender may require a co-signer on the loan to reduce their risk. If you default on the loan, the co-signer will be held responsible for repayment. Most educational loans are unsecured loans. In the case of federal student loans, the federal government guarantees repayment of the loans. Other examples of unsecured loans include credit card charges and personal lines of credit. 
<P>
<A NAME="unsubsidized"></A>
<B>Unsubsidized Loan</b><BR>
A loan for which the government does not pay the interest. The borrower is responsible for the interest on an unsubsidized loan from the date the loan is disbursed, even while the student is still in school. Students may avoid paying the interest while they are in school by capitalizing the interest, which increases the loan amount. Unsubsidized loans are not based on financial need and may be used to finance the family contribution. See Stafford Loans for information about unsubsidized Stafford Loans.

<B>Variable Rate</B><BR> 
A variable rate is an interest rate that resets
periodically, such as monthly, quarterly or annually. Variable rates
are often defined as the sum of a variable rate index, such as the
LIBOR index or the Prime Lending Rate, and a fixed rate margin. The
margins are often determined based on the borrower's credit score,
where credit scores are grouped into a small set of 5 or 6 tiers and
each tier is associated with a different interest rate and fees. 

<P>
<B>Verification</B><BR> 
Verification is a review process in which the FAO determines the accuracy of the information provided on the student's financial aid application. During the verification process the student and parent will be required to submit documentation for the amounts listed (or not listed) on the financial aid application. Such documentation may include signed copies of the most recent Federal and State income tax returns for you, your spouse (if any) and your parents, proof of citizenship, proof of registration with Selective Service, and copies of Social Security benefit statements and W2 and 1099 forms, among other things. 
<P>
Financial aid applications are randomly selected by the Federal processor for verification, with most schools verifying at least 1/3 of all applications. If there is an asterisk next to the EFC figure on your Student Aid Report (SAR), your SAR has been selected for verification. Schools may select additional students for verification if they suspect fraud. Some schools undergo 100% verification. 
<P>
If any discrepancies are uncovered during verification, the financial aid office may require additional information to clear up the discrepancies. Such discrepancies may cause your final financial aid package to be different from the initial package described on the award letter you received from the school. 
<P>
If you refuse to submit the required documentation, your financial aid package will be cancelled and no aid awarded. 
<P>
<B>Veteran</B><BR> 
For Federal financial aid purposes such as determining dependency status, a veteran is a former member of the US Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines or Coast Guard) who served on active duty and was discharged other than dishonorably (i.e., received an honorable or medical discharge). You are a veteran even if you serve just one day on active duty - not active duty for training - before receiving your DD-214 and formal discharge papers. (Note that in order for a veteran to be eligible for VA educational benefits, they must have served for more than 180 consecutive days on active duty before receiving an honorable discharge. There are exceptions for participation in Desert Storm/Desert
Shield and other military campaigns.) 
<P>
ROTC students, members of the National Guard, and most reservists are not considered veterans. 
<P>
Since the 1995-96 academic year, a person who was discharged other than dishonorably from one of the military service academies (the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs or the Coast Guard Academy at New London) is considered a veteran for financial aid purposes. Cadets
and midshipmen who are still enrolled in one of the military service academies, however, are not considered veterans. According to the US Department of Education's Action Letter #6 (February 1996), "a student who enrolls in a service academy, but who withdraws before graduating, is considered a veteran for purposes of determining dependency status". 
<P>
Having a DD-214 does not necessarily mean that you are a veteran for financial aid purposes. As noted above, you must have served on active duty and received an honorable discharge.

The form listing an employee's wages and tax withheld. Employers are required by the IRS to issue a W2 form for each employee before February 28. 
<P>
<b>Ward of the Court</b><br>
A ward of the court is someone under the protection of the
courts. The ward of the court may have a guardian appointed
by the court. The legal guardian is not personally liable
for the ward's expenses and is not liable to third parties
for the ward's debts. 
<p>
Although a ward of the court can have a legal guardian,
having a legal guardian does not automatically make the
child a ward of the court. A legal guardian can be appointed
by parental consent through a power of attorney. A legal
guardian must have been appointed by the court for the
child to be a ward of the court. When a guardian is appointed
by the court, the parent no longer has the authority to
revoke the guardianship.
<p>
Often a minor becomes a ward of the court when the court
determines that the child will be subject to abuse or
neglect if they remain with the parent or if both of the
student's biological or adoptive parents are deceased.
<p>
Note that a child does <em>not</em> automatically become a ward of
the court upon being incarcerated. The key issue is whether
the court assumed custody of the child because it found that 
the parents are unable to properly care for the child.
Likewise, emancipation does not make a student a
ward of the court. Neither incarceration nor emancipation
of the student is sufficient on its own to make the student 
independent.
<p>
The key issue for financial aid purposes is that when a
child becomes a ward of the court, no parent or other person
is financially responsible for the child. Legal guardians
and foster parents are not financially responsible for a
ward of the court. Adoptive parents, on the other hand, are
financially responsible for the child.
<p>
If the student is declared a ward of the court before
the end of the award year, the student is considered to
be an independent student for the award year and the
student's status would need to be updated. 
<p>
The school financial aid administrator should ask for a
copy of the court order that declared the child a ward
of the court. If there is any confusion as to whether the
child is a ward of the court or not, the financial aid
administrator should ask for a letter from the judge
clarifying whether the child is a ward of the court.
<p>
Note that a child can be a ward of the court and still have
contact with his or her biological parents or even still be
living with the parents (albeit under court supervision). 
The biological parents, however, are no longer empowered to 
make any decisions on behalf of the child.
