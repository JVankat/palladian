The Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law provides national leadership in identifying, developing, and supporting creative and collaborative approaches to achieve social and economic justice for low-income people and communities. The Center engages in direct advocacy campaigns in Illinois and around the country to improve policies and programs on specific issues, and also engages in broader advocacy on general issues of justice, opportunity, and human rights.

Our advocacy niche is the nexus between federal policy and state implementation, a key position in this era of devolution of power to the states in many areas of social policy and law.

Reflecting its original national mission as a leader in the law-based effort to achieve justice and opportunity for all, the Center&acirc;&#128;&#153;s advocacy has an intentionally national aspect in addition to its Illinois base.  An important component of our national work is the publication of Clearinghouse Review, a journal focused on best practice in litigation and advocacy on issues related to social and economic justice.

Also, the Center publishes an annual Poverty Scorecard, which provides a snapshot of how each United States Senator and Representative voted on legislation having to do with a range of issues, providing a measure of our elected officials&acirc;&#128;&#153; commitment to achieving justice and opportunity for low-income Americans."><span> About</span></a></strong></li>

The agency recently took action against Republic Bank &amp; Trust of Kentucky (Republic) for violating numerous consumer protection laws. Republic, which is the last RAL lender in the country, partners with Liberty Tax and Jackson Hewitt to provide the short-term, high interest loans. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: small;">In the midst of the 2011 tax season, FDIC examiners visited 250 tax preparation sites offering Republic backed RALS in 36 different states and found almost half of preparers to be in violation of at least three different consumer protection laws. According to the FDIC, Republic has violated the </span><a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/921557/000115752311002750/a6710620_ex992.htm"><span style="font-size: small;">Truth-in-Lending Act, Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, Federal Trade Commission Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. Specifically the investigation revealed that Republic failed to meet basic lending standards such as properly disclosing the terms of loans and having safeguards in place to protect consumers&rsquo; confidential information. Additionally, Republic is being charged with engaging in deceptive and discriminatory practices.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: small;">These charges, along with a fine of </span><a href="http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/NCLC-CFA-Republic-May-9-press-release.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">$2 million in civil penalties</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, comes after a </span><a href="../../../../2011/02/articles/asset-building/another-one-bites-the-dust-crackdown-on-ral-providers-continues/"><span style="font-size: small;">previous cease and desist order</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that was filed against Republic by the FDIC earlier this year. This order was filed because the FDIC found RALs to be unsafe and unsound given the </span><a href="../../../../2010/08/articles/asset-building/irs-deals-rals-a-deadly-blow/"><span style="font-size: small;">Internal Revenue Service&rsquo;s elimination of the Debt Indicator</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, a tool lenders used to estimate whether or not a tax filer would receive a refund or have their returns directed toward outstanding debt. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: small;">RALs are very profitable for lenders, so Republic is sure to put up a fight. It is our hope that this latest action by the FDIC will be the final nail in the coffin of refund anticipation loans and eliminate these predatory products altogether.</span></p>

    <p><span style="Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;Times New Roman&quot;;"><img width="250" vspace="3" hspace="8" height="359" border="0" align="right" alt="Wheelchair" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/wheelchair.jpg" /></span><span style="font-size: small;">As states privatize portions of their public benefits programs in an effort to save money, more and more Americans are getting lost in the shuffle. Recently in Indiana, a federal district court examined the privatization process in the context of one man&rsquo;s application for Medicaid benefits. In <i>Novak v. Indiana Family and Social Services</i>, 1:10-cv-0677-RLY-DML, 2011 U.S. Dist. Lexis 34249 (S.D. Ind. March 30, 2011), the court found that private companies performing functions traditionally held by state governments can become state actors and thus be held responsible for losing or delaying citizens&rsquo; applications for benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The <i>Novak</i> case began in October 2008 when a law firm representing Raymond Novak applied for Medicaid benefits on his behalf. Unfortunately for Mr. Novak and his wife, in December 2006 the State of Indiana had contracted with IBM to modernize the way Indiana&rsquo;s Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) processed Medicaid claims and applications. IBM quickly took over most of the Medicaid-related work in Indiana.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As the <i>Novak</i> court wrote, &ldquo;the effort to modernize resulted in significant delays and other problems that left the Medicaid benefits procurement process in Indiana with a backlog of unprocessed or incorrectly processed Medicaid applications.&rdquo; In fact, although the contract was supposed to run for ten years, Indiana cancelled it after less than three because of IBM&rsquo;s unsatisfactory performance. (The State of Indiana and IBM are currently embroiled in a highly publicized </span><a href="http://advanceindiana.blogspot.com/2011/04/e-mails-showed-daniels-worried-that.html"><span style="font-size: small;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> regarding the state&rsquo;s decision to terminate the contract.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Mr. Novak and his wife, Rosemarie, were victims of IBM&rsquo;s substandard performance. Not only did the service center responsible for Mr. Novak&rsquo;s application lose it (and neglect to contact Mr. Novak&rsquo;s lawyers to let them know the application had been lost), the center denied his application without providing any information about how to correct it. Mr. Novak&rsquo;s lawyers appealed, and again the service center did not respond. Once again, the lawyers learned that the appeal had not been processed and that no hearing date had been set. The lawyers then sent Mr. Novak&rsquo;s paperwork directly to FSSA&rsquo;s appeals division. When an administrative law judge reviewed the case, although she denied Mr. Novak&rsquo;s appeal, she explained her reasoning in detail so that Mr. Novak&rsquo;s lawyers could correct the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Mr. Novak was later found eligible for Medicaid benefits, but the Novaks still sued FSSA and IBM, claiming not only that FSSA&rsquo;s denial of benefits was unlawful, but asking for damages in a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The Novaks alleged that the FSSA&rsquo;s application system was prejudicial to them because it delayed Mr. Novak&rsquo;s eventual receipt of benefits and forced the couple to incur unnecessary legal fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">While the court dismissed some of the Novaks&rsquo; claims, it allowed the section 1983 claim against IBM to stand. To bring a section 1983 claim against a defendant who is not a government official, the plaintiff must show that the defendant was a state actor. Analyzing the Novaks&rsquo; description of IBM&rsquo;s actions, the court found that, because &ldquo;the State entrusted to IBM its obligation to accept, promptly review and process a Medicaid application in accordance with the federal Medicaid statutes and regulations,&rdquo; IBM was a state actor. This acknowledgment sends an important message to other states as well as to private contractors who consider entering into contracts to handle welfare work. After <i>Novak</i>, it is clear that corporations who contract with states to process Medicaid claims or other public benefits can be found responsible if they do not meet the requirements of federal law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The Novaks&rsquo; situation is not an anomaly. Texas has also </span><a href="http://www.cppp.org/research.php?aid=729&amp;cid=3&amp;scid=7"><span style="font-size: small;">contracted out</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> its eligibility determination for public benefits, and more and more states are considering privatization as a way to save money. Advocates agree that privatization of public benefits is fraught with peril for low-income clients. In a </span><span style="Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;Times New Roman&quot;;"><a href="http://www.povertylaw.org/clearinghouse-review/issues/2011/2011-mar-apr/bach"><span style="font-size: small;">recent issue of <i>Clearinghouse Review</i></span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;">, Professor Wendy Bach of the University of Tennessee Law School asserted &nbsp;that privatization not only makes it more difficult for applicants to receive benefits, privatization also reduces government accountability, making it difficult for community members and advocates to challenge inequities in the welfare system.&nbsp;The </span><a href="http://www.nclej.org/index.php"><span style="font-size: small;">National Center for Law and Economic Justice</span></a><a href="http://www.nclej.org/key-issues-privatization.php"><span style="font-size: small;"> notes</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that advocates for low-income people need &ldquo;to ensure that privatization and modernization initiatives are implemented in an effective and accountable manner, guaranteeing low income individuals and families the benefits, services, and opportunities for which they are legally entitled and that they need to achieve economic independence.&rdquo; In 2002, <em>Clearinghouse Review</em>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.povertylaw.org/clearinghouse-review/issues/2002/20020115"><span style="font-size: small;">annual special issue</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> was devoted to privatization, and the <i>Review</i> will continue to follow this important topic in future issues.</span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><img hspace="8" border="0" align="right" vspace="8" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/stethoscope.jpg" alt="Stethoscope" />In 2014, health insurance marketplace exchanges will be up and running in every state across the United States. As a major part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), these </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;Times New Roman&quot;"><a href="http://www.familiesusa.org/assets/pdfs/health-reform/Guide-to-Exchanges.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">exchanges</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> will provide an easy and consumer-friendly place for people to find and buy affordable health insurance. Perhaps the best feature of the health insurance exchanges is the federal assistance that will be offered through </span><a href="http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/7962-02.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">tax-subsidies and cost-sharing</span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;"> to individuals and families to help pay for insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. People with household incomes less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $74,124 for a family of three, will qualify for the subsidies and out-of-pocket help in the exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Looking ahead to 2014, authors of a </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;Times New Roman&quot;"><a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/%7E/media/Files/Publications/Issue%20Brief/2011/Apr/1493_Gruber_will_affordable_care_act_make_hlt_ins_affordable_reform_brief_compressed.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">recent study</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> released by The Commonwealth Fund set out to see just how affordable health insurance might really be once these insurance marketplace exchanges are up and running. Using </span><a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/%7E/media/Files/Publications/Issue%20Brief/2011/Apr/1493_Gruber_will_affordable_care_act_make_hlt_ins_affordable_reform_brief_compressed.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">survey data</span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;">, the authors determined how much &ldquo;room&rdquo; people have in their budgets, after covering costs of household necessities, to determine whether the federal tax-subsidies and cost-sharing offered in the exchanges will actually create affordable coverage options for most Americans. The results were cause for cautious optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">According to the study, an overwhelming majority of individuals and families <i>will</i> be able to find affordable health insurance in the 2014 exchanges. Thanks to those premium tax subsidies and help with out-of-pocket costs, around 90 percent of households will have enough room in their budgets to pay for the health insurance they need. This is promising news for folks struggling with the burden of run-away health care costs and a private insurance market too expensive to enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As to the remaining 10 percent who may not be able to find affordable health insurance, the study&rsquo;s authors point out three major factors worth addressing: out-of-pocket health care costs, family structure, and place of residence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The authors predict that high out-of-pocket costs will be the most common reason why some people will run out of money to pay for their medical bills. High out-of-pocket costs double and sometimes nearly triple the percentage of households that can&rsquo;t afford to meet their health care needs. Because of the way the cost-sharing structure is set up in the exchanges, the financial burden of high out-of-pocket costs will hit individuals and families with household incomes from two to three times the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;Times New Roman&quot;"><a href="http://www.coverageforall.org/pdf/FHCE_FedPovertyLevel.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">federal poverty level</span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;"> the hardest. These are households with $37,060 to $55,590 annual income for a family of three. Unless states address this when creating their exchanges, one in four families in this income range with high out-of-pocket costs will not have enough money left in their budget to cover their health care expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Family structure is also a significant factor in determining affordability of health insurance on the exchanges. When looking at family size, the study reveals that single individuals, compared to childless couples and families, have less room in their budgets to pay for health care. Regardless of income level, single individuals may find themselves unable to pay for their health care more often than childless couples and families in the 2014 exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Geography plays a role as well. The study&rsquo;s authors pooled the states into three different categories: high cost of living, middle cost of living, and low cost of living. It turns out that households in higher-cost states have less room in their budgets for health care than households in lower-cost states. &nbsp;So, for instance, a family of two making $22,068 a year will find health insurance less affordable in a high-cost state like California when compared to a low-cost state like Oklahoma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">States can address all of these factors when </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;Times New Roman&quot;"><a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Newsletters/States-in-Action/2011/Mar/February-March-2011/Ask-the-Expert/Ask-the-Expert.aspx"><span style="font-size: small;">setting up their exchanges</span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;">. They can give exchanges an active role in finding and negotiating health plans with insurance companies so that the coverage options offered are of the highest quality and at the lowest prices. They can create strong conflict-of-interest rules so that the decision-makers in the exchanges have the public interest at heart rather than profit. They can pass laws making the rules for insurance companies inside and outside of the exchanges the same so that the exchange marketplaces can attract enough insurers and consumers to offer competitive and affordable insurance plans. With rules like these in place, most people will be able to find affordable health insurance, giving our families and our children a real chance for healthy futures.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><img hspace="0" height="200" border="0" align="right" width="200" vspace="0" alt="CFPB logo" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/safe_image_php.png" />Consumers and advocates had better beware. Last year, in response to the harmful financial practices that caused unforgettable pain to millions of families across the country, Congress passed comprehensive financial reform and consumer protection legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Central among these reforms was the creation of a new agency, the </span><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/"><span style="font-size: small;">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> (CFPB). Previously, enacting consumer protections rules, performing compliance reviews, and enforcement activities were conducted by multiple federal agencies, each of whom failed horribly at their jobs. Under the CFPB, all consumer protections laws would, for the first time, be the sole focus of one federal agency with the power to actually make consumer protection a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The CFPB is supposed to be up and running by July 1<sup>st</sup>, but Congress, in its infinite attempts to please and protect Wall Street, is attempting to eviscerate the CFPB before it even becomes functional. Specifically, several bills have been introduced that, if passed, would substantially </span><a href="http://www.consumerfed.org/news/412#1"><span style="font-size: small;">undermine the CFPB&rsquo;s ability </span></a><span style="font-size: small;">to stop abusive financial practices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1315"><span style="font-size: small;">H.R. 1315</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, which was approved in the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 35-22, would allow a simple majority of bank regulators and others on the Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) to veto CFPB rules they deem to be &ldquo;inconsistent with safe and sound operations of financial institutions.&rdquo; In other words, the very banking regulators who failed to fulfill their roles as consumer advocates before would have the ability to stop the CFPB from doing the same job that they refused to do. This vague &ldquo;deemed to be inconsistent&rdquo; standard will certainly be used by these agencies to stop any consumer protection measures that might affect the profitability of financial institutions. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:0in"><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1121"><span style="font-size: small;">H.R. 1121</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, which also passed in the House by a vote of 33-24, would alter the leadership structure of the CFPB from that of a single director to a five-member commission. Thus, instead of one agency solely focused on consumers, there would be multiple agencies whose priorities are split between protecting consumers and pleasing financial institutions. The CFPB already faces </span><a href="http://www.consumerfed.org/news/412#1"><span style="font-size: small;">unprecedented restrictions on its powers</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. For instance, nowhere else in federal law can one set of regulators&mdash;in this case two-thirds of the members of the FSOC&mdash;veto the actions of another agency. The amount of funding provided to the CFPB is capped, a statutory limit imposed on no other financial regulator, and the CFPB is the only financial regulator that must comply with the federal Regulatory Flexibility Act, which allows small businesses to see proposed rules before the public does, adding months to the already lengthy rulemaking process.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Finally, </span><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1667"><span style="font-size: small;">H.R. 1667</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, approved by a 32-26 House vote, would require that the CFPB&rsquo;s Director be confirmed by the Senate before the CFPB could exercise its authorities. This follows a letter from 44 Senate Republicans stating their intent not to confirm any CFPB director until the legislative reforms weakening the CFPB have been adopted. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">As the Consumer Federation of America&rsquo;s </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFPB-Senate-Director-Confirmation-Announcement-statement-5-5-11.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">press statement</span></a></span><span style="font-size: small;"> in response to the Republican senators&rsquo; letter stated: &ldquo;Enactment of these measures would virtually guarantee that the CFPB would be a weak and timid agency without the will or ability to curb the kind of financial abuses that caused the nation&rsquo;s worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">To prevent another economic disaster and stop banking regulators from throwing consumers under the bus once again, the CFPB&rsquo;s authority and autonomy must be safeguarded. Attempts to weaken it will just return us to the status quo. And isn&rsquo;t that how we got into this mess in the first place?</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Call or send a message to your legislators today urging them not to support these bills. The Switchboard's number is <b>202.224.3121</b>. The operator&nbsp;can connect you to your legislator's office.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><img width="200" vspace="3" hspace="8" height="333" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/helping-grandma.jpg" alt="Helping Senior Citizen Walk" />There is an intense debate over </span><a href="http://paulryan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">Rep. Paul Ryan&rsquo;s (R. WI) proposal</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> to scrap Medicare and turn it into a voucher program shifting costs to seniors, a debate that became even more intense when it was passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The Senate has not passed it, and the President </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/05/statement-press-secretary-republican-budget-proposal-fy2012"><span style="font-size: small;">has registered his opposition</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. The American people are also </span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/wonkbook-84-percent-oppose-ryans-medicare-plan/2011/04/15/AFBMJ4AE_blog.html"><span style="font-size: small;">firmly opposed</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">But that debate has taken news focus away from the substantial improvements to the Medicare program that have been accomplished in just the last year under the </span><a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/"><span style="font-size: small;">Affordable Care Act</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, with more improvements soon to come. </span><a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/foryou/seniors/now/index.html"><span style="font-size: small;">Costs are lower and care is better for seniors</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> all over the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Here is what happened in 2010 and is about to happen in 2011 in Medicare under the Affordable Care Act. The numbers apply to Illinois, but the same impact is happening everywhere in America.</span></p>
<ol>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Prescription drugs are more affordable</u>. In 2010, 152,170 Illinois residents </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/healthcare/senior-factsheets/il.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">hit the Medicare prescription drug &ldquo;donut hole&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> and received at $250 rebate check to defray their costs.&nbsp;Across the state, this came to $38 million in savings for seniors.&nbsp;In 2011, everyone in Illinois who hits the donut hole will receive a 50% discount on their brand name and generic prescription drugs.&nbsp;As of March, Illinois Medicare beneficiaries who had triggered into this benefit were getting about $800 a month in savings.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Preventive services are free</u>.&nbsp;In 2010, when this section of the new law had not yet taken effect, Medicare charged co-pays for preventive services like mammograms and other cancer screenings.&nbsp;In 2011 </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/healthcare/senior-factsheets/il.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">all of the 1.9 million Medicare beneficiaries in Illinois now get all recommended preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;"><u>The annual checkup is free</u>.&nbsp;In 2010, when this section of the new law had not yet taken effect, Medicare charged a co-payment for the annual checkup.&nbsp;Starting in 2011, </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/healthcare/senior-factsheets/il.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">Medicare beneficiaries can go to an annual wellness visit with no out-of-pocket cost.</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;As of April 20, 17,508 Illinoisans have had a free wellness visit.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Premiums are lower</u>.&nbsp;Under the new law, in 2010 Medicare Part B premiums were nearly $8 less per month than projected by the Medicare trustees.&nbsp;In 2011, the </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/healthcare/senior-factsheets/il.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">premiums are almost $5 less per month than projected by the Medicare trustees.</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;The lower premium translates to $107 million in savings for Illinois Medicare beneficiaries in 2011.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Medicare Advantage</u>.&nbsp;In 2010 and 2011 </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/healthcare/senior-factsheets/il.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">all beneficiaries still retain the option of joining a Medicare Advantage plan</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> if they so desire.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">This is a story typical of many things in the Affordable Care Act. Improvements to the system are constantly rolling out, but </span><a href="http://www.ncoa.org/press-room/press-release/most-seniors-misinformed.html"><span style="font-size: small;">the general public remains unaware of them</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. In part, this is because the subject matter is complex and hard to absorb unless you are directly affected. And in part it is a deliberate strategy of the opponents to keep the focus elsewhere and downplay the accomplishments of the law as they endeavor to repeal it and roll back its benefits.&nbsp;The intense reaction to Rep. Ryan&rsquo;s proposal shows that at least the people directly affected &ndash; seniors who depend on Medicare &ndash; are well aware of the increasing quality of their program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>An earlier version of this blog post inadvertently referred to Rep. Paul Ryan as &quot;Jack&quot; Ryan.&nbsp; This has been  corrected, and we apologize for the mistake</em>.</span></p>

  <div class="blogbody">
  
    <p><span style="font-size: small;">In honor of </span><a href="http://americorpsweek.gov/index.asp"><span style="font-size: small;">Americorps week</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, the Shriver Center would like to recognize the role that Americorps*VISTA members play in helping us to be </span><a href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.6482307/k.9358/Sargent_Shriver_National_Center_on_Poverty_Law.htm"><span style="font-size: small;">creative and effective</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, and to highlight the significant contributions VISTAs make in the Shriver Center&rsquo;s work to advance social and economic justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As a cost-sharing partner to the federally-funded Americorps*VISTA program, the Shriver Center currently has seven &rdquo;volunteers in service to America,&rdquo; each of whom dedicate themselves for one year to building the Shriver Center&rsquo;s capacity to develop real-world solutions to poverty. Because the needs of low-income people are constantly evolving, the Shriver Center's understanding of the policy environment must be current, and its advocacy efforts must constantly evolve. Through research and outreach, VISTAs help the Shriver Center generate a dynamic information loop in which current information from direct service providers and the low-income people they support is analyzed and applied to help decision makers formulate meaningful approaches to addressing poverty. VISTAs also help the Shriver Center build coalitions with key stakeholders, provide valuable train-the-trainer sessions, and generate reports, websites, and other tools that advocates can use to implement solutions. In addition, VISTAs help raise funds for the Shriver Center, recruit volunteers, and help the Shriver Center improve its advocacy and communication programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The VISTAs are currently working on seven projects designed to help the Shriver Center make progress on improving school performance and high school graduation rates, increasing employment and other economic opportunities, increasing financial stability for families, improving access to safe and affordable housing, ensuring healthy futures, and enhancing the capacity of advocates to delivery legal services to low-income people. Each VISTA brings his or her own skills and passion to furthering the Shriver Center&rsquo;s mission. Here is a snapshot of our current Americorps*VISTA members and the many ways in which they are contributing to the Shriver Center&rsquo;s success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Ensuring safety, academic success, and school completion for children and youth who are parents, expectant parents, or survivors of domestic or sexual violence</i></b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Hannah Green, the VISTA for the Women&rsquo;s Law and Policy Project, works on a variety of issues that affect women and children. One of Hannah&rsquo;s main projects is the Ensuring Success in School Initiative. Under this project, she coordinates a coalition of educators, social service providers, students, and advocates who are working to address barriers to school success and completion faced by students who are parents, expectant parents, or survivors of domestic or sexual violence. Hannah is also helping to develop curricula for school personnel on how to recognize and respond to these students.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Promoting housing justice</i></b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">The recent housing crisis has shown Americans the importance of preserving affordable and safe housing and protecting low-income homeowners and renters from foreclosure. As the VISTA for Housing Justice, Eli Wade-Scott&rsquo;s projects are focused on safeguarding quality, affordable housing for low-income families. Eli serves as a principal researcher of local, state, and national housing policies and their potential impact on the housing needs of low-income households. In support of the Safe Homes Initiative, Eli also develops user-friendly materials for advocates and survivors of violence so that they can use state and federal laws to protect their housing and safety.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b><i>Bringing attention and financial support to the issue of poverty in America</i></b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Our External Affairs VISTA, Alexandra Seabrook, advances the Shriver Center's capacity by building a Shriver Center social and mainstream media program that serves policymakers, media, and other advocates with information on issues affecting low-income people. Alexandra also helps conceptualize, plan, and coordinate fundraising and community outreach events. From a grassroots Facebook campaign to a large-scale raffle, Alexandra has helped raised over $20,000 in the few months she has worked at the Shriver Center.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Training direct service providers and advocates</i></b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Since the 1960s, the Shriver Center has provided advocates around the country with the information and training they need to ensure social and economic justice for their low-income clients. Kathleen McNally, our VISTA for Communication Programs, develops content and provides editorial assistance for the Shriver Center&rsquo;s bimonthly journal, <i>Clearinghouse Review: Journal on Poverty Law and Policy</i>. Kathleen also assists with marketing and outreach efforts designed to increase advocates&rsquo; access to the important resources available from the Shriver Center.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Addressing barriers to financial stability</i></b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">One in five American households is asset poor, meaning they lack the resources to sustain themselves at the Federal Poverty Level for three months if all sources of outside income ceased. The current recession has revealed how many Americans will fall into asset poverty in the absence of strong policies to increase financial stability and asset building opportunities. Kelly Ward, the VISTA for the Asset Opportunity Unit, works to advance emerging strategies focused on asset building. Kelly is also involved with coordinating and writing recommendations for the Financial Education Workgroup to increase financial literacy among Illinois students.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Ensuring health care equity </i></b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Rachel Gielau, the Healthy Futures VISTA, works with the health care advocates at the Shriver Center to promote quality, affordable, and accessible health care for all. Rachel&rsquo;s projects take her into the community as she educates consumers about health care reform and gathers personal stories from people who have had difficulty accessing care. Rachel also contributes to Shriver publications describing the effects of the Affordable Care Act on low-income families.</span><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><b><i>Investing in our workforce</i></b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">As the Employment and Training VISTA, Jessica Palek works to ensure access to employment and career advancement opportunities for people living in poverty. Jessica partners with the Chicago Jobs Council to develop the Illinois Works for the Future Campaign, which seeks to align state strategies in workforce development and economic development and to ensure that these policies and programs are responsive to the needs of disadvantaged populations. Jessica researches and drafts communication on innovative job training and education strategies for people with barriers to employment. She also contributes to the development of an unemployment insurance manual resource tool aimed at assisting individuals apply for these benefits.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The collective work of the Americorps*VISTA members strengthens and supplements the work of the Shriver Center&rsquo;s staff. In addition to moving the Shriver Center advocacy agenda forward, the VISTAs help to build partnerships and internal capacities that are strengthening the Shriver Center's financial and staff resources and helping us make progress towards our organizational goals for long-term sustainability. The Shriver Center is grateful for the excellent work of all of the VISTAs who work in service to America to advance social and economic justice.</span></p>

  <div class="blogbody">
  
    <div><span style="font-size: small;">For decades, the federal Medicaid law has provided that the states,  in return for the billions of federal dollars they get for the program,  must arrange the program in a way that ensures that Medicaid  beneficiaries will be able to gain access to the medical care they  need. This includes the issue of the rates that the program will pay to  providers of healthcare services (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies,  etc). States have great flexibility to set rates, but they must also  pay attention to the impact that the rates have on access to care.&nbsp; </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">In the budget crisis prevailing in virtually every  state, many states have begun to look to rate-cutting in their Medicaid  programs. The federal Medicaid agency, noticing this trend, has <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-06/html/2011-10681.htm">issued  proposed regulations</a> reminding states that they continue to be  responsible for assuring access to care, and that they must consider  this obligation in their rate-setting decisions. As part of their  overall assault on Medicaid, Republican governors and members of  Congress plan to fight these&nbsp;proposed regulations, claiming  (wrongly)&nbsp;that they represent a new federal assault on state  &quot;flexibility&quot;.&nbsp; </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">In fact, states have ample flexibility under Medicaid,  including the flexibility to cut rates under some circumstances. But  they also have a&nbsp;decades-long responsibility to assure access to care.  There is nothing new in the proposed regulations--every state knew  about this responsibility before it accepted billions of federal  Medicaid dollars. What is new is the assertion that governors who  accept billions in Medicaid dollars should the have &quot;flexibility&quot;&nbsp;to  arrange the program so that people are denied healthcare and end up in  more expensive emergency rooms.&nbsp; </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">The drive for Medicaid &quot;flexibility&quot; is in fact a drive  to provide less health care to fewer people. You save money by  providing less care--not rocket science, but not good policy  either. It is also not much of a rallying cry, hence the paper-thin  coat of &quot;flexibility&quot; paint that is being applied to it.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Experts from the&nbsp;National Senior Citizens' Law Center  exposed&nbsp;the flimsiness of&nbsp;this argument <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/proposed-regulations-intended-to-ensure-meaningful-access-to-medical-care">in a blog for the American  Constitution Society&nbsp;yesterday</a>.</span></p>

  <div class="blogbody">
  
    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><img hspace="8" height="200" border="0" align="right" width="300" vspace="3" alt="Barbed Wire" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/barbed-wire.jpg" />In a case currently before the Illinois Supreme Court, the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) is suing one of its own inmates to recoup the costs of his incarceration. Although the inmate has only $11,000 to his name, IDOC&rsquo;s bill comes out to nearly half a million dollars. Despite having already garnished </span><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chibrknews-prisoner-saves-11000-but-state-wants-it-to-cover-jail-stay-20110315,0,1404035.story"><span style="font-size: small;">3% of his $2-a-day wage</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> for the past three decades, IDOC now wants to go after the savings he accumulated during his time in prison and had hoped to pass on to his daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Capturing the unfairness of the IDOC&rsquo;s actions, one of the justices put it best when he asked incredulously, </span><a href="http://www.state.il.us/Court/Media/On_Demand.asp"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;Is this court honestly to believe that punishing more diligent, hardworking and responsible inmates is what the legislature intended?&rdquo;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">There are several reasons why going after people in the criminal justice system for money makes bad policy. First, suing for the costs of incarceration discourages inmates from participating in prison employment programs, in direct opposition to rehabilitation efforts. These programs provide inmates with something constructive to do with their time, valuable job training, and technical skills. There is also an economic incentive for participation in the form of wages, however modest they may be. If inmates feel the wages they earn while working in prison will be taken to pay for their incarceration, this important incentive disappears. IDOC sues only if they believe the prisoner has assets to seize, so prisoners may feel it is in their best interest to not generate any income at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Second, even if an inmate decides to participate in prison employment, IDOC&rsquo;s policy discourages them from saving, one of the most basic components of financial empowerment. Studies have shown that incarceration reduces an individual&rsquo;s post-prison earnings by about </span><a href="http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP_Incarceration.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">forty percent annually</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. In addition to reduced wages, serving time greatly reduces a person&rsquo;s ability to move up the economic ladder; only </span><a href="http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP_Incarceration.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">two percent</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> of formerly incarcerated individuals are able to advance from the bottom fifth of earnings to the top fifth, as compared to fifteen percent for the general public. Faced with such harsh economic prospects after release, prisoners in employment programs should be encouraged to save so they can begin practicing the positive financial habits necessary for future economic stability. IDOC&rsquo;s policy sends the wrong message to inmates and ignores how financial literacy can be an essential part of successful rehabilitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Finally, the money that IDOC collects from inmates is a drop in the massive bucket that is Illinois&rsquo; correctional budget. It costs a little over a billion dollars each year to keep people in prison in Illinois, almost all of which will never be reimbursed. Out of a prison population of over 45,000, only about twenty cases a year are filed to seek reimbursement from defendants whose assets exceed the $10,000 limit. In 2010 IDOC received $9,876 in court-ordered reimbursement payments. Seizing prisoners&rsquo; savings will do little to cover incarceration costs and will only further disenfranchise people who have left prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Illinois&rsquo; criminal justice system seeks not only the costs of incarceration, but also </span><a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1281/t/1577/shop/item.jsp?storefront_KEY=737&amp;t=&amp;store_item_KEY=2753"><span style="font-size: small;">fines, fees, and other financial obligations</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. These obligations range from $5 to $200, some of which have nothing to do with the costs of the person&rsquo;s involvement with the criminal justice system. For example, a person convicted of the lowest level drug offense must automatically pay $100 to fund hospital trauma centers and $50 to a performance-enhancing drug testing fund. Limited consideration is given to the inmate&rsquo;s ability to pay these fines, creating increased economic hardship and debt. Such debt follows prisoners after they have been released, affecting their income, credit score, and ultimately their ability to reintegrate. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In the case of IDOC&rsquo;s lawsuit, the inmate&rsquo;s frugality caused a $455,000 judgment to be entered against him, suggesting that IDOC should reconsider its incentives. Good criminal justice policy should incentivize long-term planning and rehabilitation, and incarcerated individuals should be encouraged to&mdash;not punished for</span><span style="font-size: small;">&mdash;</span><span style="font-size: small;">saving and being financially responsible.</span></p>

  <div class="blogbody">
  
    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Wider Opportunities for Women (WOW) is hoping to change the way we think about economic security for families. Through its Basic Economic Security Tables (BEST), WOW has created a more accurate poverty measure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It is widely agreed that the traditional method for calculating poverty, namely the federal poverty measure, no longer provides an accurate assessment of poverty nor is it relevant to the particular constructs and circumstances of today&rsquo;s families. The federal poverty measure is a </span><a href="http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq2.htm"><span style="font-size: small;">decades-old relic</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that is based on the price of food. At the time the measure was developed, families of three or more persons spent about 1/3 of their after-tax income on food. However, currently food is only 1/7 of a family's budget, while the costs of housing, child care, and health care, none of which are taken into consideration in the federal poverty measure, have all risen disproportionately to the cost of food. </span><span style="font-size: small;"><span>Additionally, the current federal<span style="color: red;"> </span>poverty measure uses pre-tax income, but the federal<span style="color: red;"> </span>poverty thresholds were established using after-tax income, so while a family may not be<span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"> </span>officially &ldquo;poor&rdquo; they may actually fall below the federal<span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"> </span>poverty threshold once they pay taxes on their income. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The BEST tables include basic living costs, such as the costs of housing, utilities, child care, food, health care, transportation, personal and household items, and taxes into its calculations for determining its self-sufficiency or poverty thresholds. BEST does not provide for entertainment costs, like cable television or movie tickets, or other </span></span><a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/04/14/135380760/beyond-surviving-defining-economic-security"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">&ldquo;middle-class amenities&rdquo;</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;"> like family vacations and dining at restaurants that so many Americans take for granted. WOW also took into consideration different household sizes and types and is working to create measurements that will reflect regional differences in the cost of living. For example, a household without small children will not have to pay for child care, and someone living in an urban community may pay more for housing but less for transportation. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">WOW&rsquo;s goal with BEST is to accurately reflect the particular circumstances of families across the country, something the federal poverty measure fails to do. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Based on BEST&rsquo;s calculations, a family of four (two adults and two small children) needs to be earning almost </span></span><a href="http://www.wowonline.org/documents/BESTIndexforTheUnitedStates2010.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">$68,000 annually</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;"> to make ends meet. That means that each worker in the family has to make $16.00 an hour, more than twice the federal minimum hourly wage of </span></span><a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/minimumwage.htm"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">$7.25</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">. The federal poverty threshold is far below the BEST calculation at </span></span><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">$22,312 annually for a family of four</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">. What makes WOW&rsquo;s BEST self-sufficiency calculations different than other poverty measures is that it includes savings. Monthly allotments for both retirement and emergency savings are included in its formula so that economic security becomes more than just basic survival. According to WOW, a family of four should be saving about </span></span><a href="http://www.wowonline.org/documents/BESTIndexforTheUnitedStates2010.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">$226 each month</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;"> ($170 for emergencies and $56 retirement). As WOW correctly notes, true economic stability occurs when families have some savings to support themselves during financial setbacks and to provide for themselves later in life. Building assets, such as savings, is essential to intergenerational security and is the only way families can move up the socioeconomic ladder and break the cycle of poverty. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">WOW&rsquo;s report is just one of the ways in which advocates and policymakers have begun to move toward anti-poverty strategies that are comprehensive and not singularly focused on income. The United States has also been experimenting with alternative methods to measure poverty. The Census Bureau&rsquo;s </span></span><a href="../../../../2011/01/articles/economic-justice/poverty-by-any-other-name-is-still-poverty/"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Annual Social and Economic Supplement</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;"> and the newly created &nbsp;</span></span><a href="../../../../2010/05/articles/economic-justice/out-with-the-old-sort-of-and-in-with-the-new-a-new-federal-poverty-measure/"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Supplemental Poverty Measure</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;"> are both used to paint a more accurate picture of poverty in the U.S. but neither have been adopted officially by any federal agencies.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">The United Kingdom and other European Union countries take a different approach to economic stability that is based on social inclusion. Social inclusion is a way of addressing poverty beyond the traditional discussion of how much income a person needs to get by. For example, </span></span><a href="http://www.inclusionist.org/files/socialinclusionusa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">in the U.K. an individual is considered to be &ldquo;poor&rdquo; if the individual&rsquo;s income is below a certain percentage of median income</span></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">, not if his or her income is below some artificially calculated threshold. Proponents of social inclusion claim that this approach addresses the multiple barriers that prevent many individuals from participating fully in society. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">No matter the measurement, calculation, or definition used, poverty and lack of economic opportunity are serious problems in the United States and around the world. By including realistic analysis of current costs and including savings, anti-poverty advocates and researchers, like those at WOW, are providing innovative and useful ways to discuss poverty and develop solutions.</span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><img hspace="8" border="0" align="right" vspace="8" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/Dog%20Growl.jpg" alt="Angry dog" />As millions of consumers struggle through one of the most difficult financial times in American history, debt collectors continue to expand their traps. Previously, the Shriver Center reported on the use of </span><a href="../../../../2010/11/articles/asset-building/debt-collection-fake-courts-the-latest-tactic/"><span style="font-size: small;">fake courts</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> by debt collection companies to highlight the industry&rsquo;s fraudulent and abusive practices. The latest fraudulent debt collection practice is the repeated reselling of debt that has already been collected upon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Consumers Union and the East Bay Community Law Center&rsquo;s February </span><a href="http://www.defendyourdollars.org/pdf/Past_Due_Report_2011.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">report</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> on the debt buying industry revealed that debt collection abuses are on the rise. More debt is being bought and sold&mdash;industry estimates suggest that in 2005, debt buyers purchased debt portfolios valued at $110 billion, a dramatic increase from just $6 billion in 1993. There has also been an exponential growth of lawsuits against debtors. Debt collection agencies file thousands of lawsuits each month using automated software. Encore Capital Group, one of the largest debt buyers in the nation, filed 245,000 lawsuits in 2009 alone. In New York City, more than </span><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2010%2F11%2F01%2Fbusiness%2F01debt.html&amp;rct=j&amp;q=NY%20TIMEs%20debt%20collectors%20face%20a&amp;ei=4zC7TefgPMS5tgevp8jjBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdwlacmJX_y4t0GcwMCFkPosweBQ"><span style="font-size: small;">450,000 debt-collection affidavits</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> were filed by debt buyers from January 2007 to July 2008, resulting in over $1.1 billion in judgments and settlements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Many of these lawsuits are filed without any proof to back up the debt collection company&rsquo;s claims. Frequently, loan or other debt documentation is lost in during the passage of debts from one seller to another, and debt collectors take advantage of such situations to profit.&nbsp;Some debt collection agencies therefore use &ldquo;robo-signers&rdquo; who sign affidavits swearing that they have personally reviewed and verified the debtor&rsquo;s records without actually having done so. This allows debt collectors to sue on debts that they claim are too old to verify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Moreover, consumers rarely receive timely notice that they have been sued, which prohibits them from defending themselves. Even with appropriate notice, many of these individuals do not know their rights nor can they afford an attorney to argue on their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received more complaints from consumers about debt collectors than about any other industry in 2009. Nearly half of those complaints involved debts that were not owed, amounts in excess of what was actually owed, debts that had been discharged in bankruptcy, or impermissible fees, interests, or expenses.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2011/03/110321fairdebtcollectreport.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">In its 2011 Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Report</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, the FTC reported receiving 140,036 debt collection complaints in 2010, an increase from the 119,609 complaints received in 2009. The top three categories of complaints were:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;">calling repeatedly or continuously;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;">misrepresenting the character, amount, or status of the debt (including demanding a larger payment than is permitted by law); and</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;">failing to send consumers a statutorily required written notice about the debt and their rights.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The FTC is investigating the debt buying industry and will issue a report with its findings and recommendations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will also need to utilize is authority to issue rules under the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act (FDCPA) to continue to rein in abusive debt collection practices.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><img vspace="8" hspace="8" border="0" align="left" alt="Debit Cards" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/credit-cards.jpg" />JPMorgan Chase may begin </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/10/pf/debit_cards_limit/index.htm"><span style="font-size: small;">capping debit card purchases at $100 or even $50</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. Chase stopped issuing new debit reward cards in November of last year and recently announced that it will end the reward program for existing customers as well. Chase is also testing monthly fees on debit cards and checking accounts in select states. These are just some of the ways that banks and credit card issuers are responding to proposed regulations on interchange fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The recently enacted </span><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp111&amp;sid=cp111IFPLj&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr517.111&amp;item=&amp;&amp;&amp;sel=TOC_2334332&amp;"><span style="font-size: small;">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> gave the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate the amount of interchange or swipe fees (i.e., the fees that a card issuer can charge retailers for transactions involving their cards) to ensure that they are &ldquo;reasonable and proportional&rdquo; to card issuers&rsquo; costs. </span><a href="http://durbin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/statementscommentary?ID=4cc823e7-c232-44f2-bfc0-b80b31e2561a"><span style="font-size: small;">About $16 billion in interchange or &ldquo;swipe&rdquo; fees were collected in 2009</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">; averaging around 44 cents per transaction. However, </span><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/in-charge/2011/02/28/fed-proposes-cap-to-debit-card-fees/"><span style="font-size: small;">a report issued by the Federal Reserve (Fed) found</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that the median total processing cost for debit and prepaid card transactions is 11.9 cents per transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Using its new authority, the </span><a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/12/28/2010-32061/debit-card-interchange-fees-and-routing#h-46"><span style="font-size: small;">Fed has proposed rules</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that would cap interchange fees at 12 cents, starting in July. Since such caps could cost card issuers billions, they are examining potential sources of new revenue. For instance, a cap on interchange fees could cost Chase over $1 billion a year. In addition to getting rid of rewards programs, banks are considering &ldquo;</span><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704076804576181563561540554.html"><span style="font-size: small;">unbundling</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">,&rdquo; (i.e., dividing debit card services into components and charging for each of them separately). Some banks are also considering limiting the amount of debit card transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">At the same time, banks are also challenging the proposed regulations.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/11/financial-regulation-interchange-idUSN1112859420110311"><span style="font-size: small;">TCF filed a lawsuit against the Fed</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> claiming that the proposed regulations are unconstitutional because (1) they apply only to 1% of U.S. banks with assets of $10 billion or more and (2) they constitute an unlawful taking by the government of TCF&rsquo;s property (i.e., debit card income). Although the U.S. Justice Department sought to dismiss the lawsuit the judge denied this motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In Congress, legislators are also concerned and have taken action to delay the proposed rules. Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) introduced the Debit Interchange Fee Act of 2011 (</span><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-575"><span style="font-size: small;">S. 575</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">) and Representative Shelley Capito (R-WV) introduced the Consumer Payment System Protection Act (</span><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1081"><span style="font-size: small;">H.R. 1081</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">). Sen. Tester&rsquo;s bill would place a two-year delay on the implementation of any regulations and require a study examining the debit interchange payment system, including the costs and benefits of electronic debit card transactions and alternative forms of payment, the structure of the current debit interchange system, and the impact of the proposed rule reducing debit card interchange fees. Rep. Capito&rsquo;s bill calls for a one-year implementation delay and a study of the various categories of all costs and investments associated with debit card transactions and the impact of any proposed rules.&nbsp;On the other hand, the Oregon State Legislature introduced a Senate joint memorial (</span><a href="http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2011/SJM18/"><span style="font-size: small;">SJM 18</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">) urging Congress to proceed with interchange fee limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">While consumer groups agree that swipe fees should be regulated, they are somewhat divided on how to achieve these objectives. Consumer advocates such as </span><a href="http://www.uspirg.org/uploads/55/13/55136cb6850bd9b4eb20be4d12cd9a5b/Consumer-Testimony.HFSC.Interchange.Feb-17.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">U.S. PIRG, Public Citizen and the Hispanic Institute</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> support the new rule while the </span><a href="http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/debit-cards-FRB-interchange-rule-comments-2-22-11.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">Consumer Federation of America</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> has expressed concerns and has asked the Fed to increase the proposed rate cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For more information on interchange fees including other countries&rsquo; experience with similar debates, see the American Antitrust Institute (AAI)'s March 2010 report, &ldquo;</span><a href="http://www.antitrustinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Interchange%20Foer.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">Electronic Payment Systems and Interchange Fees: Breaking the Log Jam on Solutions to Market Power</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">&rdquo; by Albert A.

    <p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><img width="250" vspace="8" hspace="8" height="333" border="0" align="right" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/board-of-works.jpg" alt="Board of Works" />Officially, the recession ended in June 2009. But for many Americans, the recession is still in full force. New research shows that the recovery is not being evenly shared. Overall, workers&rsquo; earnings are down because the jobs that are hiring pay less than the jobs that were lost. Minorities face much higher unemployment and live disproportionately in states which have the worst economic climate. Young people face especially daunting job prospects. So perhaps it&rsquo;s no surprise that a </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/04/21/us/nat-poll.html?ref=us"><span style="font-size: small;">recent CBS/New York Times</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> poll shows that only 23% of Americans think the economy is getting better.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;">Meanwhile, politicians in Washington are discussing budget cuts that could derail the recovery and undermine our long-term competitiveness. Right now, we need to invest in the infrastructure of job training and education, which is a driver of our economy and will help put Americans back to work. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Well-Being Is Not Improving After the Recession</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">The </span><a href="http://www.centerforsocialinclusion.org/publications/wp-content/plugins/publications/uploads/Recession_Redux_2011_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">Center on Social Exclusion</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> went beyond just measuring gross domestic product to examine 14 indicators of well-being in four categories (housing, health, jobs, and socio-fiscal). Looking back over the last 18 months, the study found that most states had not improved their well-being. Many are still treading water, and </span><a href="http://www.centerforsocialinclusion.org/publications/wp-content/plugins/publications/uploads/Recession_Redux_2011_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">15-24</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> states have actually continued to lose ground in each of the categories. Furthermore, states with higher percentage minority populations have fared worse on these measures than predominantly white states. </span>&nbsp;</p>
</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Unemployment Is Improving Slightly, <br />
But Long-Term Unemployment Continues to Worsen</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">Private sector hiring is improving, but even with </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">216,000</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> new jobs in March we have a long way to go. There is still only </span><a href="http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/no_jobs_for_more_than_three_out_of_four_unemployed_workers2/"><span style="font-size: small;">one job opening for every four unemployed workers</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. We need to add </span><a href="http://www.epi.org/analysis_and_opinion/entry/signs_of_healing_in_the_labor_market_though_unemployment_remains_in_double_/"><span style="font-size: small;">127,000</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> new jobs every month just to keep up with population growth. At this rate it would take <em>five and a half years</em> just to halve the unemployment rate down to a more acceptable 4.4%. There at </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">13.5 million</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> unemployed Americans who are actively seeking work, plus </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">8.4 million</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> Americans who are working part-time only because they can&rsquo;t find full-time jobs, and at least another </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">2.4 million</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> who would like to work but aren&rsquo;t looking right now. The length of time workers are unemployed is still inching <em>up</em>; half of those unemployed have been looking for </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">five months</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> or longer (the average amount of time out of work is now </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">nine months</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> and rising). The overall unemployment rate is </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">8.8%</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, but the rate remains especially high for those with </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">limited education, Hispanics (11.9%), Blacks (15.5%), teenagers (24.5%), those aged 20-24 (15.0%), veterans who&rsquo;ve served since 2001 (10.9%), and persons with a disability (15.6%).</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">
<p style="line-height: normal;"><b>Real Earnings Are Falling While Corporate Profits Soar</b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">While more Americans are finding work, wages and earnings are heading in the wrong direction.</span></p>
</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;">The economy has been expanding for almost two years. Real corporate profits </span><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2289619/"><span style="font-size: small;">neared an all-time high in 2010</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, and </span><a href="http://www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch/paywatch/"><span style="font-size: small;">top CEOs earned 23% more in 2010 than 2009</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. But the gains in productivity generated by American workers are not ending up in their pocketbooks. Instead, the </span><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/03/05/number-of-the-week-workers-not-benefiting-from-productivity-gains/"><span style="font-size: small;"><i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported last month</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that, while productivity has climbed 5.2% in the first 18 months of the recovery, that had translated into record profits for shareholders, not higher wages for workers. In fact, since that story broke, real hourly wages have fallen </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/realer.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">more than 1% in the last two months alone</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. And that&rsquo;s not an isolated blip. From </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/realer_04142010.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">March 2009</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> to </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/realer.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">March 2011</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, the average American worker <u>lost</u> 1% of their total earnings in real terms.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Good Jobs Lost During the Recession Are Being Replaced By Low-Wage Jobs</b></span><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">The </span><a href="http://www.nelp.org/page/-/Justice/2011/UnbalancedGrowthFeb2011.pdf?nocdn=1"><span style="font-size: small;">National Employment Law Project released a report</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that shows that while the recession&rsquo;s job losses were concentrated in higher-wage industries (especially construction, non-durable manufacturing, finance/insurance, and information), the limited job gains since have come disproportionately in the low-wage industries (temporary jobs, retail, administrative support, and the service sector).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">
<p style="line-height: normal;"><b>We Must Re-Invest in an Equitable Recovery That Creates Jobs</b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;">We need to invest in education and training for American workers so we can innovate, grow the economy, and create jobs that pay a family-sustaining wage. The president has </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Barack-Obama-Address-to-Joint-Session-of-Congress/"><span style="font-size: small;">called on all Americans</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> to get at least one year of education or training after high school. That extra education is critical; workers over 25 with some college or an associate&rsquo;s degree currently have an unemployment rate of </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">7.7%</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, compared to </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">10.5%</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> for high school grads and </span><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">15.2%</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> for those with no high school degree. Last year, the federal Workforce Investment Act system, which provides training and job search assistance, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-pollack/workforce-development-funding-illinois_b_837810.html"><span style="font-size: small;">served 8.4 million Americans and helped 4.3 million get jobs</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. </span></p>
</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;">But our national infrastructure for job training and education is under threat. The continuing resolution recently passed by Congress to fund the government through fiscal year 2011 cut </span><a href="http://www.nationalskillscoalition.org/homepage-archive/how-the-cr-impacts-workforce.html"><span style="font-size: small;">$1 billion</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> from our nation&rsquo;s investments in job training and education, though even further cuts were averted. And House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan&rsquo;s long-term budget proposal, which passed the House on April 15, included na&iuml;ve assumptions about Pell grants, community colleges and the workforce development system, and drastic (though still vague) </span><a href="http://www.nationalskillscoalition.org/federal-policies/federal-funding/federal-funding-documents/nsc_fy2012_housebudgetresolution_2011-04.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">cuts to these critical programs</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. It should be obvious, but now is not the time to cut job training and employment services. Solving our budget crisis is important, but slashing the workforce development system will undermine our future competiveness and growth. Right now, we need to get Americans back to work.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: small;"><img vspace="8" hspace="8" border="0" align="left" alt="Computer terminals" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/computer-training.jpg" />All too often, the news about low-income people and technology is bad. Low-income communities trail the rest of the country in their </span><a href="http://www.ssrc.org/features/view/broadband-adoption-in-low-income-communities/"><span style="font-size: small;">ability to access the internet</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. As a result, low-income Americans have less access to information, job opportunities, and public services than other citizens. Moreover, the bureaucracies that have an impact on low-income Americans&rsquo; lives&mdash;namely, the city, state, and federal agencies that distribute public benefits&mdash;usually lack the most current technological innovations, and efforts to modernize program administration are frequently delayed. In New York, for example, the New York City Housing Authority&rsquo;s recent </span><a href="http://nyti.ms/dMaNON"><span style="font-size: small;">attempt to modernize</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> by installing a new $36 million computer system has been plagued by delay and lost information. Additionally, some attempts to modernize public benefits administration have unintended adverse consequences for certain populations. As Cary LaCheen wrote in </span><a href="http://www.povertylaw.org/clearinghouse-review/issues/2010/jan-feb/lacheen"><span style="font-size: small;">a recent <em>Clearinghouse Review</em> article</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, many public benefits agencies are using call centers to interact with clients in an effort to reduce face-to-face time and streamline operations. Unfortunately, this efficiency comes at a cost for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, who face multiple barriers when they try to communicate remotely with benefits agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Against this dispiriting backdrop, Single Stop USA&rsquo;s successful use of technology to benefit low-income Americans is especially welcome. </span><a href="http://www.singlestopusa.org/index.shtml"><span style="font-size: small;">Single Stop USA</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, which recently received a $</span><a href="http://www.singlestopusa.org/Media/2-23-11%20Press%20Release%20announcing%20SIF%20New%20Profit%20Grant.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">1.1 million grant</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> from the White House Social Innovation Fund, began in New York City as a project of the Robin Hood Foundation. Single Stop USA uses its revolutionary benefits enrollment network, or </span><a href="http://www.singlestopusa.org/About-Us/The-Model.shtml"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;BEN,&rdquo;</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> to help low-income people understand the public benefits maze and make sure that they are receiving all of the assistance for which they are eligible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">BEN is proprietary software that Single Stop USA counselors access over the internet on their office computers.&nbsp;After Single Stop USA counselors are trained to use the BEN technology, they are placed in local organizations such as hospitals, churches, public defenders&rsquo; offices, and community colleges. When clients go to these organizations to meet with their attorneys, go to class, or get check-ups, they can also meet with Single Stop USA counselors. The counselors interview the clients, enter some basic information into BEN, and then provide the clients with information about city, state, and federal benefits that they are entitled to receive. Finally, the counselors either guide clients through the benefits application process or provide the clients with referrals to service providers who will help them, free of charge. BEN is constantly being revised and updated; just in time for tax season, BEN now has a &ldquo;tax tab&rdquo; that can provide clients with free tax preparation. This is particularly essential for low-income clients, many of whom think that they do not need to file income taxes when, in fact, there are often credits that they are eligible for, such as child care credits and the Earned Income Tax Credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Until recently, Single Stop USA&rsquo;s work has focused on New York and California, but the White House Social Innovation Fund Grant will help it to expand nationwide. The BEN concept is well-suited for nationwide expansion, because the software can be custom-designed for every organization that Single Stop USA partners with and work with the particular array of state and local services available to clients in a given location. The White House grant is designed to help Single Stop USA with its efforts in community colleges, on which Single Stop USA plans to focus as it continues to grow. Community colleges are an ideal location for the Single Stop USA model, because the benefits that students receive from a Single Stop USA consultation can help them on multiple fronts. Obviously, students who meet with Single Stop USA counselors get immediate assistance with their taxes and benefits. Improved benefits and tax returns also help the students achieve their long-term goal: higher-paying jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Single Stop USA is not the only organization using technology to benefit low-income Americans. Indeed, Pine Tree Legal Assistance in Portland, Maine, recently launched </span><a href="http://statesidelegal.org/"><span style="font-size: small;">Stateside Legal</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. Stateside Legal acts much like Single Stop USA&rsquo;s benefits calculator, but for U.S. military veterans. Any veteran can go to Stateside Legal, enter some basic personal information, and receive legal information about state and federal programs he or she might be eligible for, as well as general information regarding foreclosure, consumer debt problems, and health diagnoses common to veterans. Veterans can also use the site to find an attorney, if necessary. Stateside Legal has </span><a href="http://www.lsc.gov/press/pressrelease_detail_2011_T274_R8.php"><span style="font-size: small;">already received about 79,000 page views</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> since its launch in November 2010.&nbsp;Stateside Legal received a $300,000 grant from the </span><a href="http://tig.lsc.gov/"><span style="font-size: small;">Legal Services Corporation&rsquo;s Technology Initiative Grants Program</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, which &ldquo;<span style="color: black;">promotes full access and high-quality legal representation through the use of technology.&rdquo;&nbsp;In fact, the Technology Initiative Grants Program funds many noteworthy uses of technology on behalf of America&rsquo;s poor, including </span></span><a href="http://www.idaholegalaid.org/node/1976"><span style="font-size: small;">I-Can! E-File</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, a free electronic tax-filing system that helps low-income Americans file for the Earned Income Tax Credit.&nbsp;The I-Can! program has 560 partners in 49 states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">As more and more organizations follow the example set by Single Stop USA, and the Technology Initiative Grants Program&rsquo;s grantees, hopefully we will begin reading more headlines about advocates successfully using technology to close the </span><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18332880"><span style="font-size: small;">income gap</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> and fewer headlines about the dearth of innovative technologies available to low-income Americans.</span></p>

  <div class="blogbody">
  
    <p><span style="font-size: small;">The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called Food Stamps) is one of the nation&rsquo;s most important anti-hunger and anti-poverty programs and helps </span><a href="http://frac.org/reports-and-resources/snapfood-stamp-monthly-participation-data/"><span style="font-size: small;">44 million Americans</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> buy food, including </span><a href="http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/snapdata2011_january.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">1.8 million in Illinois</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. In 2009, SNAP effectively lifted </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-11-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">4.6 million Americans</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> out of poverty. Today, SNAP is threatened by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan&rsquo;s long-term </span><a href="http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">budget plan</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, which </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/16/us/politics/16congress.html?ref=politics"><span style="font-size: small;">passed the House</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> on April 15, and other potential structural changes in government spending such as a global spending cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>What is SNAP?</b><br />
</span><span style="font-size: small;"><img width="250" vspace="8" hspace="8" height="123" border="0" align="left" alt="Child choosing groceries" src="http://www.theshriverbrief.org/uploads/image/grocery_kid.jpg" /></span><span style="font-size: small;">Food stamps have existed in one form or another since the </span><a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/rules/Legislation/history/legislative-early.htm"><span style="font-size: small;">latter years of the Great Depression</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, helping Americans avoid hunger and malnutrition. SNAP also helps American farmers and the </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-5-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">200,000</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> retailers who accept the benefits. The federal government pays for all SNAP benefits, and splits the cost of administering the program with the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">SNAP is a critical part of the safety-net for American families. </span><a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/faqs.htm#23"><span style="font-size: small;">Three-quarters</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> of all benefits go to households with children, and nearly </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">one-third</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> go to households where a family member is elderly (over 60) or disabled. SNAP serves American families whose income is less than 130% of the federal poverty line </span><a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/faqs.htm#25"><span style="font-size: small;">($1,579 per month for a family of two or $2,389 for a family of four</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">). This eligibility level </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-5-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">is set by Congress</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">SNAP benefits are keyed to the USDA Thrifty Food Plan, which is the Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s estimate of the cost of </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-11-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">a bare-bones, nutritionally adequate diet</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. The maximum benefits (including the </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-5-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">small temporary increase</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) is currently </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">$367 for a family of two or $668 for a family of four</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">; that amount goes to families with no disposable income after certain necessities are deducted from their income. But the </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">average person receives just $4.46 a day</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. Perhaps not surprisingly, food pantries report more need </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-11-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">towards the end of the month</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, when people have exhausted their SNAP benefits and still need to eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Ryan&rsquo;s Long-Term Budget Threatens SNAP</b><br />
Chairman </span><a href="http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan proposes</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> radical, unwise, and unnecessary changes to the SNAP program including the following.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan would cut almost </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-11-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">20%, or $127 billion</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, from the SNAP program over ten years. Slashing this much from the program would require cutting off access to food for millions of Americans, or drastically reducing benefit levels.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan would change the structure of SNAP to a &ldquo;block grant&rdquo; starting in 2015. Block grants cap federal expenditures for a particular program, and the federal government simply gives states a fixed amount each year without regard to the level of need.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan would require adult recipients of SNAP to work or engage in job training. Our society should provide the most vulnerable among us adequate nutrition, even if they or their parents are unable to work.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan would make SNAP receipt time-limited, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Such a policy would cause hunger and malnutrition for millions of Americans, especially the elderly, after they exhausted their period of eligibility.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Cutting $127 Billion from SNAP Would Rip a Hole in the Safety Net</b><br />
Slashing 20% from the SNAP program would hurt millions of Americans, including the elderly and working families. It would also hurt farmers and retailers and shift a huge financial burden onto the states. In Illinois alone, a conservative estimate of the cuts would be </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-11-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">$5 billion</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> in lost support over 10 years. That is money that families could not use to buy healthy food, and money stores would not bring in, reducing employment and increasing </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/FoodDeserts/"><span style="font-size: small;">food deserts, areas that lack access to healthy food</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. If the $127 billion in cuts come from solely from narrowing eligibility, at least </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-11-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">8 million</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> individuals would need to be cut from the program. If the $127 billion in cuts come from a universal cut in benefits, it would be a reduction of over $30 per person per month, which adds up to </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-11-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">more than $1,000</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> a year for a family of three. There isn&rsquo;t much else to cut&mdash;SNAP is efficiently run and has an </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">extremely low error rate</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, with over 98% of SNAP benefits going to households who are qualified for the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>SNAP Should Remain a Federal Program</b><br />
SNAP is, and should remain, a federally funded program for three main reasons. First, hunger is a national problem, and ensuring access to enough food for all Americans should be a shared commitment. Second, SNAP benefits food producers and sellers all around the country, ensuring steady national and local supplies of food. Third, if SNAP were block-granted, states would not be able to adequately respond to increases in need caused by natural disasters or recession. In 2005 after the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, for example, SNAP provided </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">two million suffering families $1 billion in benefits</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Block-Granting SNAP Would Undermine Its Purpose and Is Not Necessary to Control Spending</b><br />
Chairman Ryan believes that block-granting SNAP would help keep spending down. In fact, the block-grant structure is unwise and unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">First, it&rsquo;s unwise because a block-grant structure would rob SNAP of the flexibility to respond to times of increased need, like natural disasters and recessions. It is a testament to the flexibility of the program that in this time of unprecedented economic challenge it has grown to a record high, with </span><a href="http://frac.org/reports-and-resources/snapfood-stamp-monthly-participation-data/"><span style="font-size: small;">44 million Americans receiving SNAP in January 2011</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. SNAP must remain a counter-cyclical program to keep families afloat in difficult times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Second, block-granting SNAP is not necessary to keep spending in check. Chairman Ryan </span><a href="http://budget.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">incorrectly asserts</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that SNAP costs are rising out of control. In fact, the growth of SNAP </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-5-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">is already slowing</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> as the recovery begins. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that SNAP expenditures will begin to fall starting in </span><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/budget/factsheets/2011b/nutrition.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">2012</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. The program&rsquo;s cost will return to a </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-5-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">.3% share of GDP</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">&mdash;the same as before the recession &ndash; by 2021. You can find state-level trends calculated by <em>Food Research and Action Center</em> </span><a href="http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/snapdata2011_january.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">here</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In the last decade, SNAP costs have increased for four reasons. The vast majority of the rise is temporary and caused by the recession ,which has caused increase expenditure on SNAP because more people than ever qualify for help. The SNAP caseload </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">closely tracks</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> the number of people in poverty and the unemployment. Here in Illinois, for instance, in the last five years the unemployment rate has increased by 71% (</span><a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=usunemployment&amp;met=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=state:ST170000&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=illinois+unemployment+rate"><span style="font-size: small;">from 5.6% in January 2006 to 9.6% in January 2011</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">), and SNAP receipt has increased by 48% (</span><a href="http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/snapdata2011_january.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">from 1,216,433 to 1,803,223</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">). Also, Congress and the President responded to the recession by temporarily boosting SNAP benefits by an average of </span></span><a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/fns/recovery/ARRA_Powerpoint.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">$46 per household</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">, which will expire in </span></span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/4-5-11fa.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">October of 2013</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;">. This expense is one of the </span></span><a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/fns/recovery/ARRA_Powerpoint.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">best forms of stimulus</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: black;"> in which our government has invested. A small part of the increased cost of SNAP comes from higher food costs, since the maximum SNAP amount is tied to the cost of a bare-bones nutritious diet. Finally</span>, in the last decade we have made strides in getting qualified people who need help buying nutritious food enrolled in SNAP, but still </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">one-third</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> of eligible families do not receive SNAP, especially working families and the elderly. All this demonstrates that the biggest causes of the rise in the cost of SNAP have been the rise in the number of people who qualify for SNAP, and increase in benefits, both of which are temporary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Adding a Time-Limit and Work Requirement to SNAP Are Impractical and Naive</b><br />
The House doesn&rsquo;t really think that people will stop needing to eat, do they? For many adults around the nation, SNAP is literally the only government support to which they are entitled that prevents their utter destitution and starvation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan&rsquo;s proposal to require SNAP recipients to work or do job training is unrealistic and expensive. States already have smaller-scale employment &amp; training programs for SNAP recipients, and require able-bodied childless adults to work or engage in training. But expanding this program to all recipients would swamp already-strapped states, driving up administrative costs with additional personnel and infrastructure. Paradoxically, elsewhere in Ryan&rsquo;s plan he guts our nation&rsquo;s investments in job training! Even the recently passed FY 2011 continuing resolution cut </span><a href="../../../../2011/04/articles/budget-and-taxes/congress-passes-2011-budget/"><span style="font-size: small;">$1billion</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> from job training and education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Protecting SNAP&rsquo;s Ability to Prevent Hunger in Challenging Times is a Moral Imperative</b><br />
SNAP literally saves lives. SNAP helps families improve their nutrition, because </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">90%</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> of SNAP benefits go to fruits and vegetables, grain products, meats, or dairy products, and the program includes a strong </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;">nutrition education component</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. Research shows that the national expansion of SNAP (Food Stamps) in the 1960s</span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2226"><span style="font-size: small;"> reduced infant mortality</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. That&rsquo;s why prominent Americans, including conservatives like </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1274"><span style="font-size: small;">Bob Dole</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, support SNAP. Hunger and malnutrition in America was real&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t remember it, </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1274"><span style="font-size: small;">watch this moving video</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">. Today, tens of millions of Americans&mdash;</span><a href="http://frac.org/nearly-one-in-five-americans-report-inability-to-afford-enough-food/"><span style="font-size: small;">one in five</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> &ndash;struggle to buy food for their families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Our lawmakers face a stark challenge&mdash;a growing structural deficit at a time of unprecedented need. But SNAP is not a part of the structural problem. For decades now our nation has embraced this core belief&mdash;that in a land so prosperous and fortunate as America, no adult, child, or elder should go hungry.

       </div>
       
     
  
  <div class="blogbody">
  
    <p><span style="font-size: small;">Here is how the long-term budget plans recently put forth by </span><a href="http://paulryan.house.gov/UploadedFiles/PathToProsperityFY2012.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> and </span><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2011/04/13/country-we-believe-improving-america-s-fiscal-future"><span style="font-size: small;">President Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/13/fact-sheet-presidents-framework-shared-prosperity-and-shared-fiscal-resp">compare</a> </span><span style="font-size: small;">on several critical factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Deficit Reduction</u><br />
All agree that reducing the United States&rsquo; current $14 trillion indebtedness is a critical national priority. The President&rsquo;s plan would reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years, enough to stabilize the national debt so that it increases no faster than the economy. Rep. Ryan&rsquo;s plan would have no perceptible impact on the federal deficit, since by his own estimation, his proposed $4.3 trillion in spending cuts are entirely offset by his proposed $4.2 trillion reduction in taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Balanced Approach and Shared Sacrifice</u><br />
President Obama follows the </span><a href="http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/"><span style="font-size: small;">Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction commission&rsquo;s recommendation</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> that deficit reduction be 2 parts spending cuts to 1 part revenue increases.&nbsp;50/50 would be a fairer balance, but there is at least the semblance of shared sacrifice as the wealthy are asked to give up their Bush era tax cuts when they expire next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Congressman Ryan&rsquo;s budget has no balance or shared sacrifice.&nbsp;At least 2/3 of his recommended spending cuts are to programs for people of limited means, and he not only asks for no contribution from the wealthy but significantly enriches them by making the Bush tax cuts permanent, further weakening the estate tax, and lowering the top tax rate from 35 to 25%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Distribution of Spending Cuts</u><br />
The President would cut defense spending by $400 billion over 12 years and would also cut agricultural subsidies.&nbsp;Ryan&rsquo;s budget does not cut in either of these areas, thus unfairly concentrating his proposed cuts on only limited parts of the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Investing for the Future</u><br />
While the President&rsquo;s plan makes deep spending cuts in a number of areas, it also includes spending increases in areas he identifies as drivers of economic growth, including energy innovation, education, health care reform and infrastructure. Ryan&rsquo;s budget makes no investments for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Health Care</u><br />
The fundamental differences between the Ryan and Obama plans come into high relief when their recommendations for the publicly funded health care programs Medicare and Medicaid are compared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan&rsquo;s health care plan includes no cost containment measures and would, </span><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12128/04-05-Ryan_Letter.pdf"><span style="font-size: small;">according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office,</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> substantially raise overall costs for Medicare beneficiaries. It lowers federal health care spending solely by shifting costs on to the states and the elderly, disabled and low-income people who participate in these programs. </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3462"><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan would cut Medicaid funding by $1.4 trillion over the next ten years</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">; Illinois&rsquo;s share of this cut would be $47 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">In addition, Ryan would &ldquo;block grant&rdquo; the Medicaid program, meaning the amount of federal funding the state receives each year would be fixed and would not be adequately adjusted for such cost drivers as medical cost inflation, growth in the population, and aging of the population.&nbsp;The impact of block granting Medicaid would be harshest during recessions, when federal funding would no longer automatically increase to assist more people who lose their jobs, income, and health insurance. This would not only increase hardship and destitution in recessions, but also would further weaken a slumping economy and lead to the loss of many more jobs.&nbsp;And it would deprive states of one of the most important forms of enhanced federal support during recessions, deepening state fiscal crises and crippling the ability of states to meet the greater needs of their citizens in recessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Ryan would also </span><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3453"><span style="font-size: small;">end the Medicare program</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, which provides guaranteed health care to all persons over 65. He would replace it with a voucher paid to private health insurance companies that would shrink in value over time, shifting more and more of the cost of health care onto the elderly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Obama proposes to bring down the cost of coverage by bringing down the cost of health care itself, instead of just shifting the cost.&nbsp;He would build on the cost containment measures in the Affordable Care Act, producing $100 billion in savings over twelve years from actual cost reductions. There would be no cost shifting to the states or program participants. He would not block grant Medicaid nor would he end Medicare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Political Courage</u><br />
Rep. Ryan&rsquo;s plan imposes over 2/3 of its spending cuts on the politically safest target, low-income people, while offsetting all spending savings with extremely large tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, accomplishing no net deficit reduction at all.&nbsp;He asks for no sacrifice from his base, and he creates clear winners among the financial backers of his political party.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">President Obama&rsquo;s plan provides a balanced approach (albeit relying somewhat too much on spending cuts and not enough on revenue increases), shared sacrifice, and real deficit reduction without undermining the fundamental structure of our health care safety net programs.&nbsp;There will be significant pain among core elements of his base.&nbsp;The President leveled with the American people, making clear that the solution will not be achieved by magical elimination of &ldquo;waste and abuse&rdquo; or reduction of programs like foreign aid, but instead by austerity in basic programs and services that the vast majority of Americans want or need and a shared responsibility to produce needed revenue.</span></p>
