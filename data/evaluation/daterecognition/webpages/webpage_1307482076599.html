<p>Hello, I&#8217;m back again and it&#8217;s that time of year for my end of season awards. I&#8217;d like to say these award winners were picked by you, the readers but I&#8217;m far too lazy for that, these are my picks of the season, let me know if you agree or disagree. It&#8217;s been one hell of a season with ups and many more downs but there are still imaginary awards to give out. My one and only rule is that it&#8217;s one award per player, some might&#8217;ve overlapped but lets give the others a chance&#8230; ay Jack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Player of the Se</strong><strong>ason</strong></p>
<p>So my player of the year is young <strong><span style="color:red;">Jack Wilshere</span></strong>. What a season it&#8217;s been for him and only his first as a first team member. There was some competition for this prize, I&#8217;ve got down here Nasri, van Persie and Sagna as his rivals but no one can touch Jack in terms of consistent good performance through the season; Robin might&#8217;ve taken this one if he has remained fit but that&#8217;s the way the cookie crumbles.</p>
<p>He was Arsenal.com&#8217;s player of the season too and he&#8217;s obviously become somewhat of a fan favourite. He is probably not our most technically gifted player but he is definitely up there &#8211; his ball control is incredible, he has great vision for a guy who has just got into this team and without a doubt he is our hardest worker. I&#8217;m a sucker for anyone who gives their all for Arsenal and that&#8217;s exactly why I love Jack so much. There is so much more promised to come from this guy, which makes it pretty exciting to be an Arsenal fan. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I make him my 2011/12 player of the year again next season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Young Player of the Season</strong></p>
<p>Well if weren&#8217;t for him winning my main prize then obviously Jack Wilshere would be taking this one as well. Surprisingly there aren&#8217;t that many other condensers for young Gun of the season but my stand out man is <strong><span style="color:red;">Roy Szczesny</span></strong>. It&#8217;s been a great season for the young Pole as he has all but established himself as our no.1 thanks to Almunia&#8217;s poor performances and Fabianksi&#8217;s injury. Ever since returning from his loan at Brentford the fans have been calling for him to pull the gloves on for the first team and since being given his chance you can&#8217;t say he&#8217;s let us down.</p>
<p>He hasn&#8217;t been perfect, but he looks a solid &#8216;keeper capable of making great saves and I expect him to improve with games. Next season will be a vital one for him, next pre-season he will be expected to outperform fellow countryman Fabianski for the no.1 spot but I&#8217;m expecting Roy to be the next Polish sensation since Mr.Sheen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Worst Player of the Season</strong></p>
<p>I think this is a prize that many fans would wish we had a few replicas of to dish out but I have to pick just one. My shortlist includes Almunia &#8211; for his costly errors, Squillaci &#8211; for the same reasons, Denilson &#8211; for his lack of footballing ability, Rosicky &#8211; for his total drop in form and Eboue &#8211; for being a totally deluded idiot. Well I have to pick one and personally I&#8217;m going for <strong><span style="color:red;">Denilson</span></strong>. As far as I&#8217;m concerned I&#8217;ve totally had it and I&#8217;ll be gob-smacked it Wenger doesn&#8217;t cut his losses with this one in the summer. He had an okay season a couple of years ago but being dropped has done him no good whatsoever, he can&#8217;t even fucking pass a ball anymore and seeing him live, in action, fucking up everything he had to do at The Hawthorns this season was the final straw for me. Denilson, in the politest possible way, fuck off please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Most Improved Player </strong></p>
<p>Again, this is an award with Wilshere&#8217;s name all over it, or failing that Szczesny but thanks to my stupid ruling neither of them can have it. Instead it&#8217;s a chance for Djourou, Nasri or Fabianksi to take the imaginary stage and read out their imaginary speech. Samir Nasri had a great start to the season, he was our best player back then but unfortunately it was exactly that &#8211; back then. He went through that great run of form that faded out very quickly which was a big disappointment. I really hoped he&#8217;d get back to his best but it didn&#8217;t really happen so hopefully next year he can sort that out. I&#8217;ve been really impressed with Djourou this season actually, after missing the whole of the previous season through injury I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d prove so influential in the campaign just gone but it was great to see, more next year please Johan.</p>
<p>However my award for most improved player though goes to <strong><span style="color:red;">Lukasz Fabianksi</span></strong>. As his nickname, &#8216;Flappy&#8217; suggest he hasn&#8217;t really been the best of &#8216;keepers we&#8217;ve had at the club, until this season. After Arsene decided enough was enough with Almunia he gave Fabianski the chance to step up and for a little while we all saw what the manager was talking about. He really was great; it was like we were seeing a completely different player. Unfortunately for him though, he injured his finger in a pre-match warm up and that was the last we saw of him. He&#8217;ll be back this summer though, eager to earn that place back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Most Disappointing Player</strong></p>
<p>My biggest disappointment has to be <strong><span style="color:red;">Thomas Vermaelen</span></strong>. It&#8217;s an odd choice for this award as his performances were not lacking &#8211; it was his attendance. I&#8217;ve picked him though because I believe his injury and resulting months of absence were a massive downfall in our season. It&#8217;s been a year of bad defending and maybe some of that might&#8217;ve been helped with Tom in the side. To say I&#8217;m looking forward to a full campaign from him next season is an understatement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Best Summer Signing</strong></p>
<p>The nominees for this award are Chamakh, Koscielny and Squillaci. I think we can rule out the latter there but you have to say that all in all the other two had decent debut seasons. Marouane kicked off his Arsenal career really well and got bags of goals in the opening few months but eventually he got a bit tired and that form died off but I was still impressed with his contribution and effort in the latter stages of the season. However for his all round performance it has to go to <strong><span style="color:red;">Laurent Koscielny</span></strong>. I know some Gooners aren&#8217;t his biggest fans but he has done remarkably well for his first season in the Premiership and despite a few silly mistakes he&#8217;s made some fantastic tackles and great headers. It&#8217;s a hard task to come to a new club, a new division and be expected to play nearly every game and play it well so he&#8217;s done really well when you consider the circumstances. I believe in Laurent and I think next season will be a much improved one on his part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Un-Sung Hero</strong></p>
<p>I was tempted to give this one to Chamakh because people started giving him a bit of stick towards the end of the season but it&#8217;s easy to forget his vital contribution at the start and also to not notice his commitment despite lack of goal towards the end. However this award is made for <strong><span style="color:red;">Bacary Sagna</span></strong>, he&#8217;s one of our best players but being in the position he is in he will never get the praise he deserves. He&#8217;s started to get a bit more appreciation to be honest and most people do notice the job he does but as a right back he&#8217;ll have to do something special to be player of the season. Just keep it up Bacary, you&#8217;re doing a great job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Biggest Cunt of the Season</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the new awards for this season and there were plenty of nominees. You&#8217;ve got your usual lot in there, Spurs, Chelsea, Stoke, Birmingham, Nani and the expression &#8216;Mental Strength&#8217;. However my winner of the ugliest award in football goes to the referee at the Nou Camp, <span style="color:red;"><strong>Massimo Busacca</strong></span> for <em>that</em> red card awarded to van Persie. It was a total joke of a decision and I will never understand the rationale behind it. It completely ruined a great game and you never know what might&#8217;ve happened if we&#8217;d remained with 11 men. Massi<del>mo</del>ve Cunt Busacca, you are a massive cunt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hero of the season</strong></p>
<p>Not to be confused with the Un-Sung Hero award, this is almost the Sung Hero Award if you like; which goes to the man who was most heroic this season and stopped us from being ever shitererer. I&#8217;ve gone for <span style="color:red;"><strong>Robin van Persie</strong></span> who went on an incredible goal scoring run since he returned back from his traditional yearly injury. He&#8217;s broken the record for consecutive goals scored away from home and has been our outright source of goals the second half of the season. He single-handedly kept this team in it at times and if it weren&#8217;t for him then we probably wouldn&#8217;t have even qualified for the Champions League. Keep it up Robin, just try bloody not get injured! With him fit for a full season I reckon he might get near those amazing goal rates of Thierry Henry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Goal of the Season</strong></p>
<p>For this award I personally like to weigh up the quality of the goal quite heavily with the importance of it. There have been some brilliant strikes this year but the one that springs most to mind for me is <span style="color:red;"><strong>Arshavin vs. Barcelona (2-1)</strong></span>. It was a brilliant counter-attacking move, the passing and vision in the build up was exquisite and the finish was so cool and so calculated. Most players in Arshavin&#8217;s position would&#8217;ve blasted it, probably high and wide but he curled it expertly low into the far corner but you have to credit Nasri with a great assist also. It was also an indescribable feeling seeing that goal in and to go 2-1 up on Barcelona. For these reasons it&#8217;s my goal of the season and I&#8217;m sure none of you will pass up the opportunity to watch it one more time:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Low Point of the Season</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve got a long list of contenders for this one. There was some really awful results this season including the 3-2 vs. Spurs and the 4-4 vs. Newcastle. However from my long list the one that stands out the most is <strong><span style="color:red;">the Carling Cup Final defeat</span></strong> and the resulting collapse of our season. It is not a big trophy, we all know that but it was hyped up to be the &#8216;stepping stone to greater things&#8217; and propel this side into the one we all know it&#8217;s capable of being. Obviously, that didn&#8217;t happen and it ended up being the &#8216;stepping in cow shit in your best shoes&#8217; and totally destroyed our season. We won a grand total of two league games following the cup final loss and I think was the biggest factor in our title collapse.</p>
<p>The manner of defeat was just awful too, although we hadn&#8217;t played our very, very best we we&#8217;re looking like we would beat Birmingham in extra time then WHOOPS a big fat mix up between Szeczesny and Koscielny and we&#8217;ve allowed Martins to score into an empty net in the last minute. It was one of the most disappointing matches I&#8217;ve ever had the displeasure of attending and there&#8217;s nothing more you could really say at the time apart from a series of expletives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Highlight of the Season</strong></p>
<p>So it turns out the highlight of the season was that <span style="color:red;"><strong>Arsenal 2-1 Barcelona</strong></span> home win. To beat the European champions was indescribable and I&#8217;m just glad I was lucky enough to be there. I know we didn&#8217;t win the tie as a whole but we have to take what positives we can from this season and to beat them was just brilliant. I hate Barcelona, with a passion and for us to get one over on those fucking cheating, Cesc-stealing, ridiculous diving, paella-eating wankers was brilliant. It showed just what we were capable of on our day and left us all hoping we could do it. In the end it didn&#8217;t happen but it&#8217;s still nice knowing we beat the eventual winners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Word of the Season</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Disappointing</strong></span><br />
[dis-uh-point-ing]<br />
1. To fail to fulfill the expectations or wishes of.<br />
2. To defeat the fulfillment of (hopes, plans, etc.); thwart; frustrate.<br />
3. To bring or cause disappointment.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s pretty much what it has been like to be an Arsenal fan this season. Roll on the next one.

<p>Five years ago this very day, on a May afternoon back in 2006 in Borehamwood I sat down at the desk and signed up to a Blogger account and put my finger and thumb to my chin to think up a name for an Arsenal blog. Back then I thought every name was taken, what must it be like now trying to come up with a title! I think I was about two paragraphs into my first post when I decided to scrap the whole idea and turned off the computer. So with now no intention to write a blog, I suddenly came up with the name <em>The Cannon</em> and I thought I&#8217;d give it another crack, this time on WordPress. So I sat and wrote <a href="http://the-cannon.com/2006/05/18/hello-world/">the very first blog</a> and to be quite honest with you I never thought it&#8217;d last; however the very next day there was some big, big news and that was that Thierry Henry would be staying; and from there the blog continued. There are blogs out there that have been running for a lot longer than me but 5 years is a bit of a personal milestone so it&#8217;s only fair to give it a mention I think.</p>
<p>I just want to start by saying thank you to everyone that has visited the blog over the years, it sounds a bit soppy but without the readers there would be no blog, I mean there would be no point in doing it would there? So I really appreciate every hit I get and I love seeing feedback from all round the world. I never thought that the blog would grow as quickly as it did and it was that early burst of interest that kept me going.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very busy year in my personal life but no so much on here because of that. There have been a couple of (only very slightly football related) mental breakdowns in the past year that have resulted in some periods of absence but I think people are used to that now. There was a bad blip from late last year where I posted only once in October and then not again until the beginning of this year, and I regret that. In my, &#8216;hibernation&#8217; lets call it, I lost a great deal of my readership and I&#8217;ve been working ever since to try and resurrect the blog but I know it&#8217;s a long process. I can see this busy period in my working life coming to an end soon so hopefully it&#8217;s back on track for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/sol-campbell-champions-league-final-barcelona-paris.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2425" title="sol campbell champions league final barcelona paris" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/sol-campbell-champions-league-final-barcelona-paris.jpg?w=300&#038;h=132" alt="" width="300" height="132" /></a>So the blog being 5 today, means that 5 years and one day ago I was in Paris for the 2006 Champions League Final where a 10-man Arsenal lost late on against Barcelona. It was heartbreak for all Gooners but I still think it was just a fantastic occasion to be involved in and I had an amazing time travelling across the Channel to support the Arsenal. Winning the trophy that year not only would&#8217;ve arguably represented our greatest triumph as a football club but also would&#8217;ve meant a piece of silverware, something we haven&#8217;t picked up since the FA Cup a year prior to that.</p>
<p>I was at that game in Cardiff when Paul Scholes missed his penalty in the shoot-out and Patrick Vieira stepped up to score the winner from the spot with his last kick in an Arsenal shirt. I remember it clearly I was up in the top tier of the Millennium Stadium right next to the United fans; despite how well I can picture the scenes they still seem fucking ages ago. 6 years ago this month we last won a trophy, ouch. We&#8217;ve come pretty close in that time including two Carling Cup finals, one against Chelsea back in Cardiff and also this year&#8217;s final vs. Birmingham at Wembley. I was present at both of those finals too and this year should&#8217;ve really been the year that we turned the saying from &#8216;Arsenal haven&#8217;t won a trophy in six years&#8217; to &#8216;Arsenal have only won the League Cup in six years&#8217;. A last minute calamity between Koscielny and Szczesny meant we gifted it to the Brummies and we continue in our search for a big silver thing.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been involved in a few title races in those 6 years too but our lack of one of those big silver things has dented our confidence. Every time it has been the same old story &#8211; promise so much but fall miserably at the end. This year in particular has been the most solid example of that. Only a month or two ago we were in a position where the destination of the title was actually in our hands, now you have Arsenal.com running stories headlined: <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/champions-league-what-if-we-finish-fourth-">Champions League &#8211; What if we finish 4th?</a> It&#8217;s a sorry state of affairs that we&#8217;ve allowed it to happen but our form has been so, so terrible since that Carling Cup defeat that we&#8217;re now looking to finish not second, not third but fourth.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? In 2011/12 are we going to just stroll out and do exactly the same thing again? Well, frankly I don&#8217;t think it will be that easy. Man City are going to strengthen like you wouldn&#8217;t believe, as will Chelsea to an extent I imagine, United will build upon this year&#8217;s triumph and Liverpool are looking to break back into the top four. It&#8217;s going to be a challenge not just to fight for the league title but also to remain in the top four. I think for these reasons there needs to be some serious improvements for next year otherwise things are going to go from bad to worse.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the one to tell you how we&#8217;re going to do that but transfers are a start; they are not the solution, but they will certainly help. Mentions this week of Scott Parker haven&#8217;t been totally dismissed by me, he might not be the quality of player you&#8217;d hope we&#8217;d bring in but if we had a few more players with his mentality we would be in a much stronger position. We need more men that are willing to give their absolute all on the pitch and fight for the team &#8211; for that reason I wouldn&#8217;t actually mind us putting a bid in for Parker. He could be a back up to Song that we so desperately need plus show one or two what it means to actually earn your money as a footballer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s set to be a busy summer of ins and outs but I also hope Wenger is working on a strategy for the future. Something in his philosophy isn&#8217;t working and I hope he&#8217;s not blind to that. I have a feeling (or it could just be a hope) that he&#8217;s going to be a bit more ruthless in the future and that might be shown by him cutting his losses on some disappointments this summer but we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a worrying but very interesting future ahead of us, and I look forward to the next 5 years writing about it. Thanks for reading, as always.

<p>This is usually the part where I apologise for disappearing again and round up what I have missed. Well I&#8217;ll tell you where I&#8217;ve been, I&#8217;ve just come off the back of one of the busiest working weeks of my life, so busy that I didn&#8217;t have time to write a blog, didn&#8217;t have time to catch up on the news and didn&#8217;t even have time for the luxury of sleep. I could&#8217;ve written on Friday or Saturday to preview the Villa game but frankly I felt inept having not read a line of Arsenal news in the week prior and I was catching up on some much needed sleep! Plus i went to watch Bournemouth vs. Huddersfield on Saturday in the League One Play-Offs for a bit of a change of footballing scenery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like me to have avoided Arsenal news for so long, I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;re just the same spending every day on different blogs reading up the latest news, gossip and opinion. It was kind of weird not having that last week but I guess it was a bit convenient as it sort of comes at a time when Arsenal isn&#8217;t exactly all bliss and wonderful. Since we last spoke we&#8217;ve gone and lost to Stoke and Villa, just two more losses to add to the huge pile of disappointment this year.</p>
<p>I was at the game on Sunday and it was a rather strange atmosphere, it all kicked off with the protest march outside the ground before the match, which almost set the tone for the day. I was in the ground with about half an hour to go until kick off and the stadium was rather empty at this point. In fact by the time we had kicked off it still hadn&#8217;t filled up and that was the way it stayed. It was still about 80%-90% full but there were empty red seats scattered all round the ground which just goes to show unless there&#8217;s been an epic flu outbreak in the North London area then a great deal of fans have seen quite enough for one season.</p>
<p>Then of course we were 2-0 down inside 15 minutes and that never turned around so people were pretty grumpy, including myself. Then late in the second half came the usual announcement of the attendance, which they claimed was 60,023, which is an absolute joke. I&#8217;ve been to the ground enough times to know what 60,000+ looks like and that was not it on Sunday. That number denotes there being a packed-out stadium to the eye and that&#8217;s not what we had, it was definitely a 58,000-59,000 number yesterday. They&#8217;ve done this all season though; they announce the attendance as the number of tickets that got sold not the number of people that turn up. Why are they doing this? Are they scared to show that they&#8217;re losing support or are they just unaware of the definition of the word attendance? The number should represent the number of fans that attend the match, not including those that had a valid ticket for the game and didn&#8217;t bother going along.</p>
<p>Anyway it&#8217;s a silly thing to get caught up on but the announcement of this number sparked a large portion of the crowd to start the boos and jeers. You could hardly hear the announcer say,<em> &#8220;Arsenal Football Club would like to thank you for your continued support&#8230;&#8221;</em> for all the boos ringing around. This led on to chants of, &#8220;6%, you&#8217;re having a laugh!&#8221; And, &#8220;Spend some fucking money!&#8221; There were others that I couldn&#8217;t quite make out but there was definitely hostility being directed at the directors’ box and bench. I&#8217;ve since heard that you could tell Wenger picked up on these chants and looked like he felt quite uncomfortable by them. In one way I want to say &#8216;good&#8217; but another part of me feels bad for him.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember this well another time when I&#8217;ve seen such a majority of fans turn against the club like I&#8217;m seeing at the moment. The disappointment on the pitch combined with the price hike in the stands has left most fans bitterly angry. I have this strong feeling that we&#8217;re starting to become more like customers to the club than fans and sometimes that gets to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to say that I&#8217;m part of that percentage of fans that are actively campaigning against the club and I&#8217;m not one of the thousands that booed the team on Sunday but I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m in the large majority that feels like something isn&#8217;t quite right and I&#8217;m utterly disappointed. Unusually for the final home game of the season there were fans leaving with 10 minutes to go this weekend, any other game I&#8217;d just think it was normal but not this one. Then on the final whistle it seems the majority was heading for the exits and only a few stayed behind to watch the &#8216;lap of appreciation&#8217;. Given the opportunity, I have always stayed behind for this, I don&#8217;t know why I just quite like to see the players off one last time ahead of a boring summer but this time around after the final whistle I upped and left. I was pretty gutted about our performance and it typified the way we had failed this season and I just didn&#8217;t see any reason to hang around this time. You could say I was a bit depressed with the way everything had gone, I was genuinely upset walking up those stairs and although I had to think for a minute whether I wanted to stay or not I think I did the right thing.</p>
<p>I think this was the feeling that most felt however some did stay behind. Some stayed to applaud the players off as they came round and thanked the fans for their support however a staggering number seemed to stay behind simply to boo their team. I&#8217;ve seen videos and highlights from this lap and you can hear boos quite clearly through the applause. It&#8217;s a bit sad really I think, I mean as fans we have every right to show how we feel but for those people to go out of their way to boo the team was a bit wrong. I think what those people should&#8217;ve done what I did and head for the exits, I think the shock of the amount of empty seats for the lap would&#8217;ve hit home to the players and manager much stronger than a few boos. That&#8217;s just my opinion.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to lie but earlier on Sunday I was thinking &#8216;this is our chance to wave goodbye to Cesc&#8217; but I didn&#8217;t stay to bother. It&#8217;s sad thinking that I might not ever see him play again but oh well. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/fabregas-ruled-out-of-premier-league-finale">His season is over</a>, he wont be playing at Fulham either so we may have just seen the last of Cesc Fabregas in an Arsenal shirt. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting summer and he is just one of a few that could be going through the exit door at London Colney.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s set to be a busy, busy summer for Arsenal. In terms of transfers we desperately need to strengthen yet again and especially with the price rise fans are going to be angry if we don&#8217;t spend that extra money. I&#8217;m not quite sure who we might look to bring in yet, but there are a few names already being talked about for the exit. Fabregas, Nasri, Clichy, Bendtner, Arshavin, Rosicky, Gibbs, Denilson and maybe a couple others all have some probability of leaving this transfer window. Over the next few weeks Wenger will be having talks with some of these players about their futures and don&#8217;t be surprised if a few of those names are no longer with us come August. If there are to be departures I hope they are sorted out quickly though, I can&#8217;t be arsed to go through a whole summer of speculation and I the sooner they&#8217;re gone the sooner we can look to replace. All this talk is for another day and another blog post though.</p>
<p>It feels very much like the end of the season but we&#8217;ve got one more game to go away to Fulham. We&#8217;ve got pride to play for now and the small matter of automatic Champions League qualification which is now out of our hands.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.

<p>Those of you who read Friday&#8217;s blog will know that I&#8217;m pretty busy with work at the moment. Well I thought that I should mention as some kind of disclaimer that I haven&#8217;t been to sleep yet, I&#8217;ve been up all night working so if anything seems a little strange there&#8217;s your explanation. I&#8217;m pretty jealous of you people waking up this morning to this blog but I guess my lack of sleep if my own fault for putting things off for so long. Some things never change.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of that and more Arsenal. The squad got the train up to Stoke yesterday and Robin van Persie tweeted this decent bit of news to us:</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see Tommy in action today. He might not start but it&#8217;s good to know that that achilles is finally sorted and he can concentrate on playing again. We could do with his fighting spirit and all round mentalness! However the focus today isn&#8217;t going to be on Thomas Vermaelen, it&#8217;s obviously all about Aaron Ramsey and Ryan Shawcross. Wenger has tried to play the story down but there&#8217;s no avoiding it really. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-it-will-do-ramsey-good-to-go-back">Arsene has said that it will be good for Aaron to go play</a> and even dropped his two favourite words in saying that the Wales captain is mentally strong.</p>
<p>I can only guess, but I would imagine Aaron is quite up for this one. I think he will be going out there to show that&#8217;s he&#8217;s back and that&#8217;s about it really. I&#8217;m not expecting him to lamp Shawcross in the chin or anything, although I would very much enjoy that. He seems a pretty calm and professional guy and I think he&#8217;ll just get on with it, do his job and play to the best he can.</p>
<p>As for Stoke though, they&#8217;re still very bitter about what Ramsey did to Shawcross. I mean how dare he put all that stress and unhappiness on poor Ryan and the mental trauma it inflicted on him must&#8217;ve been just awful. I&#8217;ve read some ridiculous stuff on Stoke forums this week, there are people out there fully willing to boo Aaron for whatever their reasons are and there&#8217;s even people going as far as advocating him breaking his leg again. I know not all Stoke fans are the same but I can pretty safely say they are a massive bunch of cunts.</p>
<p>Since Stoke joined the Premier League we has formed a little rivalry between the clubs. The managers, the fans, the players, the staff &#8211; everyone at Arsenal and Stoke hate each other. I&#8217;ve caught the bug and I hope we destroy them today. I loathe Stoke City and whatever misfortune they get is fully deserved in my opinion. It&#8217;s going to be a pretty heated game on and off the pitch this afternoon, I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re without Fabregas, Diaby and Nasri plus I haven&#8217;t heard how Djourou and Clichy are doing either. I know Djourou travelled because there was pictures of him getting a massage up on twitter yesterday but I&#8217;m not sure on Clichy. It&#8217;s not going to be our best line up but it&#8217;s one that <em>should</em> be able to beat Stoke:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Szczesny<br />
Sagna &#8211; Vermaelen &#8211; Koscielny &#8211; Gibbs<br />
Song<br />
Ramsey &#8211; Wilshere<br />
Walcott &#8211; van Persie (c) &#8211; Arshavin</span></strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not very confident about my guess of the team this week. Vermaelen and Gibbs there could easily be replaced with Djourou and Clichy depending on fitness. Also Walcott and Arshavin don&#8217;t strike me as the sort of players for this game either; Theo&#8217;s pace could be devastating against Stoke&#8217;s defence but I&#8217;m worried about the pairs ability to fight. We&#8217;ll see. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Bendtner start in what could be one of his final games for the club.</p>
<p>However that midfield I am confident about. It&#8217;s the trio that faced United and did so well and I&#8217;m backing them to continue that form into today. They just worked perfectly, Song did the right thing and just hung back sorting everything out and making it hard for strikers to get through to our back four whilst Wilshere and Ramsey alternated in attacking runs and sitting back and it all worked like a well oiled machine.</p>
<p>I always have that niggling concern of will the players be up for it? Too many times we&#8217;ve dropped points from not turning up against less glamourous opposition and to be frank I&#8217;m fucking tired of it. I have a feeling that today we&#8217;ll be alright though, as I said the atmosphere will be pretty intense today and it&#8217;s a game that both teams just really want to beat the other. As in the winning and losing sense rather than the fighting sense&#8230;well hopefully.</p>
<p>I would love nothing more than to shut those fuckwit Stoke fans up by beating them today. Hopefully the players feel the same. I&#8217;m off back to work now but I&#8217;ll be tuning it at 2 o&#8217;clock this afternoon for what should be a tasty game.</p>
<p>Come on Aaron, come on Arsenal. Let&#8217;s do it.

	<p>Hello and welcome back after another traditional unexplained break by The Cannon. I have good reason though I promise, I&#8217;m in the final few weeks of my degree course and things are pretty hectic at the moment. Well they should&#8217;ve been hectic for a long while but as is usual with me I&#8217;ve put everything off to the last minute and I haven&#8217;t even had a minute to think about the blog never mind write on it. So I apologise to those of you left disappointed &#8211; I&#8217;m back, for now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve missed a fair bit in the time I&#8217;ve been gone. Firstly we beat Man united, which is always good. &#8216;Always&#8217; is probably not the best choice of word seeing as it&#8217;s not very often we put one over on our Mancunian rivals. It&#8217;s a shame that we blew it against Sunderland, West Brom, Blackburn, Liverpool, Spurs and Bolton to make the match last weekend almost pointless but you have to try and enjoy beating United all the same. The result didn&#8217;t really make me think what might&#8217;ve been though, it&#8217;s obvious how much this team feels the pressure and with the pressure well and truly off we were able to come up with a result. As much as I thought we were going to lose I wasn&#8217;t surprised that we won under the circumstances. That doesn&#8217;t make any sense does it? I know what I mean anyway.</p>
<p>So despite that result we still look out of the title race unfortunately. Wenger said today that <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-chelsea-must-win-on-sunday">we need Chelsea to win on Sunday</a> but I think he knows deep down we&#8217;ve blown it already. Chelsea kick off at Old Trafford immediately after our game at Stoke and a second loss on the bounce for United would allow Chelsea level on points with them. It&#8217;s quite remarkable that they&#8217;ve got into a position for that to happen, I guess you have to take your hat off to Chelsea for their recent form; it&#8217;s where we have failed. If we were to win at Stoke then a Chelsea win would put up three points behind both of them. A great position it sounds but with just two games to go I wouldn&#8217;t get too excited and go <a href="http://www.betus.com/">online betting</a> on Arsenal to be Champions. Plus there&#8217;s the whole <em>if</em> we win at Stoke too&#8230;</p>
<p>The Britannia has been a tricky ground for us in recent years but we won there last season and I&#8217;m hoping we can do it again. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-chelsea-must-win-on-sunday">We&#8217;ll be without Fabregas, Diaby and Nasri</a>, however we managed to beat Man United without most of them so surely we can do Stoke. Also Djourou and Clichy are doubts but Vermaelen could return to the squad. It&#8217;ll be great to see Thomas again if he does make it; it&#8217;s been far, far too long. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/-i-d-have-bought-if-i-d-known-vermaelen-fate-">Wenger admits</a> that he would&#8217;ve tried to bring in a replacement if he knew he was going to be still out which is kind of frustrating to hear because I never got the impression the manager was left so out of the loop with the situation as much as the fans were. It&#8217;s decisions like that which may have ultimately cost us silverware this season but there&#8217;s no point in getting hung up on it now I guess&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/aaron-ramsey-injury-stoke-away.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2543" title="aaron ramsey injury stoke away" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/aaron-ramsey-injury-stoke-away.jpg?w=300&#038;h=129" alt="" width="300" height="129" /></a>So with Fabregas out Ramsey will continue in his place and there is a fair bit of hype about his return to Stoke 15 months after that terrible leg break. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-leave-ramsey-to-prepare-for-stoke">Arsene has tried to play it down</a> but there is obviously going to be something said about it. I hope that it&#8217;s all positive though, I hope Aaron uses it as motivation to have a good game and show not only everyone else but himself that he has fully rehabilitated and found his form again. I read some hilarious but shocking stuff on a Stoke City forum today, they&#8217;re still so bitter about what mean old Aaron did to innocent little Ryan Shawcross it&#8217;s unbelievable. I can&#8217;t actually comprehend that they&#8217;re discussing booing him for what he did. Actually maybe I can, how dare he break his leg at their ground?! It&#8217;s a joke.</p>
<p>I guess we&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s any drama on Sunday but I think Ramsey is professional enough just to treat it as another game and hopefully, like I said, if anything he uses it as motivation to have another good game on the back of last weekend.</p>
<p>Moving on and there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about the rise in ticket prices announced this week. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arsenal-fc-announces-pricing-approach">There&#8217;s a 6.5% rise on tickets for next season</a> which doesn&#8217;t sound like much but when it comes to renewing season tickets we&#8217;re talking about an extra few hundred quid. They&#8217;re saying that the rise is in line with inflation but it&#8217;s not like anyone is getting a pay-rise in line with inflation or that what goes on, on the pitch has improved considerably. Had we won something this season then it might&#8217;ve been slightly justified but it&#8217;s all come a bit out of the blue really and it&#8217;s a decision which will price many fans out of seeing their club.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that though, Red and Silver Memberships have gone up in price considerably too. Red has gone up to £31 and Silver up to an astonishing £49. I think that it&#8217;s absolutely ridiculous that they charge that much money for the simple privilege of being able to buy tickets. It&#8217;s a joke really. So that&#8217;s a 6.5% rise in ticket prices but a 25% rise in Junior Gunners, 50% for Silver and 55% for Red. They&#8217;ve kept that one quiet haven&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s frustrating because as Arsenal fans we have no choice. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re just going to all jump ship because it&#8217;s got too expensive. We are (well most of us are) Arsenal <del>fans</del> customers for life so we&#8217;re suckered into this. They can charge us what they like and we&#8217;ll have no choice but to pay it if we want to see our team. I will reluctantly pay it, most of us will but it&#8217;s sad that some people will have to give up going to see Arsenal because they can no longer afford the cost. I know there are reasons for the rise but it&#8217;s harsh on fans to get the money from them when there&#8217;s been all this talk recently of millions of pounds exchanging hands for shares and sponsorship deals. In the past year or two we&#8217;ve given out a lot of new contracts and along with other expenses the money has to come from somewhere and unfortunately it&#8217;s us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to leave that discussion there because there&#8217;s not much we can do about it and also this blog is getting pretty long. There may be protests etc but at the end of the day the rise has been put in place and they&#8217;re not going to change it now. We&#8217;ll just have to cut the costs elsewhere by not buying a half time pie, not buying the shirt and not buying the programme (which is going up to £3.50 a pop I hear). But knowing me I&#8217;ll end up buying all three of those things anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>Talking of the new shirt, just quickly before I go I got an email from Nike with some photos and videos that you might like to see. The photos you&#8217;ve probably seen/I can&#8217;t be arsed to upload them all but I&#8217;ve uploaded the video to youtube for ya.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve struggled to know what to write the last couple of days. We are currently in one of those customary periods of silence from the club following a disappointing result so there isn&#8217;t a great deal to talk about or any news to discuss. It&#8217;s probably for the best though that Arsenal.com goes into hibernation for the week, you don&#8217;t want to anger fans further with silly articles &#8211; and there are a lot of angry fans out there. It is strange though that in the build up to a match that was the biggest game of our season just a couple of weeks ago there is this deathly silence.</p>
<p>So basically I haven&#8217;t really planned what I&#8217;m going to write today, I just thought that I&#8217;d sit down infront of the keyboard and type whatever comes out. It&#8217;s partly due to the lack of news but it&#8217;s also a good exercise for me to release some feelings I have. I could start previewing the Man United game but frankly the match isn&#8217;t wetting my appetite much at the moment.</p>
<p>What has been the main point of discussion doing the rounds on the Arsenal blogs is pretty much the state of our football club. Many are upset with how our title hopes have so dramatically and depressingly fallen and with that there always comes anger. It&#8217;s been a few days since we lost to Bolton now and I&#8217;ve calmed down quite a bit. I&#8217;ve accepted the position we&#8217;re in and that&#8217;s that as far as I&#8217;m concerned personally.</p>
<p>However some extremists have taken our recent failures as the final straw and there&#8217;s even a protest being organised for the final home match of the season, against Aston Villa. The group, <em>&#8216;Where has our Arsenal gone?&#8217;</em> or the black scarf brigade, as some are calling them have published <a href="http://www.wherehasourarsenalgone.webeden.co.uk/#/news-press-release-2542011/4550867928"> this press release</a> detailing their grounds for protest and will march before the Villa game to make their voices heard. However as <a href="http://viewfromn5.blogspot.com/2011/04/protests-what-do-black-scarf-really.html">The View from N5</a> points out, all their arguments for protest are quite ridiculous really. There&#8217;s stuff in there about the club not making enough commercial revenue, a mention of the kits we wear, a call for Peter Hill-Wood to get the sack, something about moving the away fans to the upper tier and some other bits that you can read for yourself if you haven&#8217;t already. They do talk about the rumoured rise in season ticket prices which is something that all fans are going to be upset about and I see their point there but it hasn&#8217;t even been officially announced yet.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that the points they outline are enough reason for a protest march. We&#8217;ve seen plenty of football protests in recent years but we&#8217;re not in as bad a position as any of those clubs. For that reason I find it somewhat embarrassing that a group of fans are choosing to do this, it&#8217;s good that we care about the club and we will fight to resolve problems but I just don&#8217;t think this one is right. The papers are going to pick up on this and the opinions of a few fans will be taken as the opinion of all of us and I can see a big falling out ahead. Also how silly is it going to look with people holding signs saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re fed up with the lack of revenue the club makes through commerical deals! But we don&#8217;t want to pay for it by buying new kits every season!&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess we&#8217;ll see how that all turns out in a few weeks. To be honest I was a bit surprised when I read that statement the other day that there was no mention of Stan Kroenke or any takeover issues. Now that would be something that I could understand protesting against, not that I&#8217;m saying I would be joining in that march but I can understand how Gooners might not agree with it. I&#8217;m also surprised that there was no real mention of on the pitch matters which to me is what is most important. They do say that we need to buy two world class players to propell us to the next level but most people know that it&#8217;s not just as simple as that. You can&#8217;t just go to Madrid and ask for Kaka just because we want him. I also loved this line:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to see Mr Wenger repeat his early successful years with the club.</p></blockquote>
<p>Haha! Well obviously.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s on the pitch matters that interest me most, obviously I care about the business of the club, how we are run and all these types of things but I&#8217;m just a football fan at heart and I get my kicks out of going to watch Arsenal play, not worrying about our financial revenue. Our fall from a title winning position has been quite dramatic and quite depressing. I have tried to remain optimistic for as long as possible but I&#8217;ll admit now that the challenge is over.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all down to this run of draws that we&#8217;ve been on. It absolutely ridiculous. I can&#8217;t make my mind up what it is down to, the performance hasn&#8217;t been up to scratch recently and although sometimes you saw the players look like they really wanted it the overall attitude has not been right for this title fight. Everyone has got their theory about why that is, be it lack of experience, lack of quality, being paid too much, not enough competition for places, formation, personel or whatever else you think it&#8217;s down to. Personally  think it is a mixture of all of these things plus a total lack of mental strength.</p>
<p>You can tell that this is something that Wenger thinks is very important just from the amount of times he mentions mental strength, attitude and desire but somehow he&#8217;s not inspiring it into his players. This drop in form at the business end of the season is becoming too familiar now and once again it has been our downfall in our hunt for our first trophy since 2005. I think we have massive issues with confidence and I believe we were just a few minutes away from solving that problem this season. It&#8217;s a kind of catch-22 but we need the confidence gained from winning silverware to be able to win silverware. We almost achieved that this season in the Carling Cup and I&#8217;m convinced that if we hadn&#8217;t of made that disastrous error in the last minute of the final we&#8217;d have gone on to win it in extra time and things would be a lot, lot different right now.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no point in keeping on thinking back to that now, I guess all we can do is hope to put it right next season and I hope Wenger takes the Carling Cup are seriously as we did this season. If we could&#8217;ve won that it might&#8217;ve propelled us on to greater things in 2011. However now I&#8217;m just hoping that 2012 can be our year of triumph whether we need to win the League Cup on the way or not. I&#8217;m already thinking to next season, but this one ain&#8217;t over yet. We still need results to keep us in the automatic qualification spots, dropping to 3rd or even 4th will be further damaging to our already in-tatters confidence so we need to get behind the team and support them right up until the final whistle on 22nd May at Craven Cottage.</p>
<p>A few so called supporters this season have lost touch with the definition of their description; we&#8217;re there to support the lads and do everything we can to help them win. It&#8217;s pretty simple. After 22nd May that is the time for questioning, that is when we can look to change personnel, add experience, add quality and sort out issues with the team. Up until that point though I hope you&#8217;ll join me in supporting the team to the end. I am not 100% happy with how things are going for us at the moment but the summer is the time to question who should remain at the club and who shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s more than enough babbling on for this afternoon. Thanks for reading Arsenal fans.

	<p>Well that&#8217;s it; done. I&#8217;ve come to get used to the title race coming to the end but this year I really hoped we could go all the way and despite hoping and hoping after draw after draw it is finally over now after yesterday&#8217;s loss to Bolton. In a way it&#8217;s pretty relieving, no more hoping and dreaming, just whatever happens happens and we look forward to the new season.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very similar to the way it fell apart last season, a bad April month taking us from a great position to completely out of it in the space of a few weeks. It&#8217;s kind of depressing, but it was coming really. It&#8217;s been coming since we lost the Carling Cup final, since we drew 4-4 with Newcastle, since we lost a 2-0 lead to Spurs, since we lost a 3-1 lead to Spurs, since we scored against Liverpool in the 98th minute and didn&#8217;t win&#8230; I could go on and one but all of these games are examples of where our confidence has been absolutely destroyed, hence the terrible run in. Wenger keeps going on about our mental strength but it is our complete and utter lack of this that has been our downfall. I now can&#8217;t stand it when Arsene mutters those two words in the hope that if he says it enough it will be true, well it&#8217;s not &#8211; we&#8217;re in pieces and we need sorting right out.</p>
<p>However &#8211; all that needs to come in the summer though. I understand the frustration at the moment, that comes with falling out of the race for silverware but there&#8217;s nothing we can do at the moment. The summer is the time for change and I hope it is a very busy summer indeed. But we&#8217;ll leave that until then, all we can do now is try and enjoy the rest of the season as much as we can and just support them in the race for 2nd or indeed 3rd.</p>
<p>We started the game really brightly yesterday, we came out flying and it caught Bolton out a bit. I thought we should&#8217;ve had a penalty early on when Walcott was brought down but it wasn&#8217;t to be. We kept pressing though and we looked likely for an early goal. After time Bolton found themselves back in it; with every one of our misplaced passes and defensive slips the home side&#8217;s confidence grew as ours limped.</p>
<p>We had a few chances but the way things were going I wasn&#8217;t surprised when Bolton opened the scoring in the 38th minute. Sturridge the scorer from a corner after we failed to keep it out. They probably deserved their half time lead, we started well but that counts for nothing and they looked the more dangerous in the first half. Cesc had a shot blocked and I think we had one other chance but Bolton were almost through on goal a couple of times and really should&#8217;ve scored earlier than they did.</p>
<p>We needed to come out in the second half and sort it out but we nearly made it a whole lot worse. Djourou conceded a very soft penalty and it was up to Szczesny to keep us in it &#8211; and he did saving Kevin Davies&#8217; poorly struck spot kick. If that had gone in then I fear what might&#8217;ve happened but we actually equalized not long after the penalty save. A nice drive towards the box, into the feet of Nasri who laid it off for Robin again who struck it low inside the post. A nicely taken goal and it looked like we had some confidence back. We spend most of the second 45 in Bolton&#8217;s half of the pitch, we were going for the winning goal and we were desperate for it.</p>
<p>However again just like the first half, every time we failed Bolton improved. They were catching us out on the break a few times showing us that we were still in danger of losing this one. Wenger threw on Chamakh in the 64th minute taking off Alex Song, there was no doubting that we needed to win.</p>
<p>Out best chances came to Samir Nasri. First he found himself clean through thanks to a great lofted pass from Cesc or Robin, can&#8217;t remember. I thought, &#8216;Goal.&#8217; Had to be. Samir from earlier in the season would&#8217;ve stuck that in whilst already thinking about his celebration but he struck it right at the keeper and the demise in his form in front of goal epitomizes the dip in the whole team&#8217;s attitude. A few minutes later he had the chance to put it right when Chamakh nodded it down for Samir in front of goal but again he couldn&#8217;t put it away. I couldn&#8217;t fucking believe it.</p>
<p>We were desperate for a goal, I wanted us to score so much. Not just to keep us in the title race but to at least make next weekend&#8217;s game a bit more exciting. I had almost conceded the title after the Spurs game but I still hoped that we might keep the race interesting by beating Bolton.</p>
<p>Instead it was a 90th minute header from Bolton to put the cherry on top. There was no coming back from it, there was no way we were going to score two goals even in the 5 minutes of extra time and with that poor defending from yet another corner went our 2010/11 season.</p>
<p>So instead of hoping to at least keep next Sunday&#8217;s game versus United interesting I now find myself thankful that Chelsea overtook us so that United can&#8217;t win the league at our ground this weekend. God it&#8217;s fucked up being a Gooner.</p>
<p>The collapse since the Carling Cup Final has been incredible. I always said that winning that trophy would give us confidence for the rest of the season but the way we lost it ended up being a larger blow than anyone could&#8217;ve imagined. That last minute cock up between Szczesny and Koscielny has cost this season dearly and we all just need the season to just be over now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very sad to know it&#8217;s all over and I don&#8217;t see myself bothering to go again this season. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve given up on them or anything like that or I can&#8217;t be bothered to go because we&#8217;re not in a title race. I just can&#8217;t really afford to spend that much money on a ticket, travel, food and drinks just to let down by the same mistakes time and time after again. It&#8217;s getting fucking boring and it&#8217;s making me skint!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m craving change; I&#8217;m utterly fed up of seeing us fall at the same hurdles every game, month, season. A change of manager? Who knows, to be honest right now I wouldn&#8217;t mind. A change of players? One or two positions still need serious sorting out and if Wenger can&#8217;t see it now then he really has lost it. Maybe something else needs changing, but now is really not the time. Lets just try and enjoy what&#8217;s left of the season because I know in two or three months I&#8217;ll be missing the bastards again!</p>
<p>Oh it&#8217;s tough being <del>a football fan</del> an Arsenal fan. But we keep going and our next target is to try and end the season on some high with a win over Man United.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.

	<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nasri-chamakh-tottenham-spurs-carling-cup.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2837" title="Nasri chamakh tottenham spurs carling cup" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/nasri-chamakh-tottenham-spurs-carling-cup.jpg?w=450&#038;h=226" alt="" width="450" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>The North London derby is always vitally important to any Arsenal or Tottenham fan but today is yet another one that is just that little bit more special. A win always means everything to both sets of fans but we&#8217;re at a point in the season where we genuinely need the points, never mind fan pride. With Man United dropping two points at Newcastle last night we have an opportunity to close the gap which we <strong>must</strong> take. We&#8217;re not going to get a lot of chances to catch up on United so we have to take them when they come. We&#8217;re seven points behind them today so a win tonight could bring that back down to a much more manageable four. Four points is definitely a title race position especially when United have to play Chelsea and us.</p>
<p>Spurs are desperate for points too though and they will take confidence from beating us at our place. They can go level on points with Man City in 4th with a win over us tonight and they will be desperate to not only get back in the Champions League but end our title hopes. Let&#8217;s be honest, a loss tonight would pretty much be the end of it, there&#8217;d be a slim hope but nothing more than that. Also a loss for us and a win for Chelsea against Birmingham tonight would see us drop down to third, which is a bit shocking.</p>
<p>Lets not think about losing though, we have to have our eyes on the prize. We&#8217;re in a title race and we need a win at White Hart Lane &#8211; if the players aren&#8217;t up for it tonight well then they&#8217;re never going to be. We might have some complaints about Liverpool but that&#8217;s behind us now, we need to take confidence from Newcastle&#8217;s result last night and close the gap. <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6885306,00.html">Wenger says</a>, <em>&#8220;I still believe it is absolutely important, essential that we give absolutely every drop of blood to do it.&#8221;</em> I hope that ambition is shared with the players. You&#8217;ve probably seen <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6884832,00.html">this interview with Cesc Fabregas</a> that emerged yesterday and he talks about a difference between pretty football and winning things. This season was our chance to make the step up, we may have missed it but we&#8217;re still in there and I hope Cesc et al. have got the desire to make it happen this season.</p>
<p>We might not deserve the title this year but so fucking what, I want it. It&#8217;s still doable and to come from behind in the position we&#8217;ve been in would be great. Imagine what winning the league would do to the players, that experience would be invaluable. A win at Tottenham would be the perfect catalyst to the end of season run, Wenger spoke about trying to remain unbeaten until the end of the season but it&#8217;s wins we need. Three points tonight would set up a massive game on May 1st between Arsenal and Man United so lets make sure we&#8217;re in that position come May and win tonight.</p>
<p>In the reverse fixture earlier in the season we lost a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2. That fucking hurt, and I hope it hurt the players too. They should be going there tonight not for revenge but just to put that right. We cannot let them take more points off us, it&#8217;s just not right. We&#8217;ve played there already this season in the Carling Cup, it was 1-1 after 90 minutes but we ended up beating them 4-1. We need to show that kind of dominance we showed in extra time that night, we need to remind them who owns North London and who is the team celebrating 50 years without winning the league.</p>
<p>It should be a pretty decent team playing tonight. There&#8217;s some great news that PFA right back of 2010/11, <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/37871/injury-news">Bacary Sagna is back</a>, not only will that strengthen us at the back but it means we&#8217;ve got no clown ready to give another 100th minute penalty away. Vermaelen is a bit short for tonight, it would&#8217;ve been great to have a player of his calibre available but Wenger is right not to rush him back. I feel that Jens Lehmann might fill his kind of void tonight, I&#8217;m sure the German will be making his voice heard in the dressing room. Arseblogger this morning speculated that Wilshere could be rested after <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/37875/wenger-i-ll-tread-carefully-with-wilshere">Wenger spoke of Jack&#8217;s fatigue</a>. He was withdrawn early against Liverpool and he did look quite tired. I think he&#8217;ll start him tonight though, his desire to win is something that we need tonight and hopefully that can rub off on his elders.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s how I think we might look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Szczesny<br />
Sagna &#8211; Djourou &#8211; Koscielny &#8211; Clichy<br />
Song &#8211; Wilshere<br />
Fabregas (c)<br />
Nasri &#8211; van Persie &#8211; Arshavin</span></strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve chosen Arshavin over Walcott for tonight, I feel that (if he&#8217;s up for it) he can offer us that little extra something special out of nowhere which might be what wins the game. Theo was a little bit disappointing on Sunday but I&#8217;ve always preferred him as an option from the bench anyway. However it might be a good idea to start him though to deal with Gareth Bale on his wing, Theo is good to deploy there not only to track Bale&#8217;s runs but also to use that space on the counter. It&#8217;s up to Wenger &#8211; Arshavin or Walcott; now I&#8217;ve thought about it more I think he&#8217;ll probably go for Theo but we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Talking of Bale, <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-two-who-make-tottenham-tick">Wenger says he and Van der Vaart are their main threat</a>. Bale is decent but I can&#8217;t believe the hype over him this season. It&#8217;s an absolute joke. He won the PFA player of the year for basically one hat trick against a tiring, and shit Inter Milan side. And they lost that game anyway! I saw a stat recently that he&#8217;s got the same amount of assists as Van der Sar in the Premier League and that says a lot. He is going to be tricky down that left hand side but I really don&#8217;t rate him anywhere near some people do. After saying all this he&#8217;ll probably go and score tonight but fuck him, the chimp-looking, banana-peeling shit cunt. As for Van der Vaart, he&#8217;s a good player but gets tired easily, mark him out of the game and we&#8217;ll be fine. Tonight is about closing down every player in possession, think back to when we beat Chelsea in December, I want a performance like that tonight &#8211; I want to see the players really want this as much as the fans.</p>
<p>The nerves/excitement have kicked in already, I&#8217;m buzzing for this one. It could be a massive disappointment but at the same time it could end up being the result that we look back on as the one that changed our fortunes in the title race. I&#8217;m being optimistic but I believe we can do it, I&#8217;ve seen how we can fuck things up in the past but I truly think we&#8217;ll go there tonight with a huge desire to win. I wish I could be there tonight with the couple thousand Gooners travelling down Seven Sisters Road. I was after a spare but it doesn&#8217;t look like I&#8217;ll get one now so Sky Sports and a few beers it is.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing left to say now, it&#8217;s up to the players to win this one for us. Believe in them and they will deliver. COME ON YOU GUNNERS.</p>
<p>Oh and finally&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The wanky Tottenham Hotspur went to Rome to see the Pope,<br />
The wanky Tottenham Hotspur went to Rome to see the Pope,<br />

We&#8217;re the boys in red and white and we&#8217;re fucking dynamite,<br />

	<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of days to calm down from this one but to be honest I was never really angry once I left the stadium. I was fucking furious at Eboue for that ridiculous push and the rest of the team for not just booting it out whenever possible but then I soon went into the all too familiar state of disappointment. I&#8217;m just about beginning to accept being constantly let down, it sucks but it&#8217;s been a recurring theme. If I earned a pound for every time I&#8217;ve used the words frustrating or disappointing in response to Arsenal then, then I could probably buy us a more intelligent reserve right back.</p>
<p>Although Eboue is a fucking idiot, you can&#8217;t blame the result all on him. Yes, he was the one that conceded the most stupid penalty I&#8217;ve even seen with my own eyes but once we&#8217;d gone 1-0 up in the 97th minute there should&#8217;ve been no chance for Liverpool to come back. We had just a few minutes to hold out and surely that&#8217;s not too much to ask? Oh, it is? Okay. Is it so much to ask to stick your boot through the ball just the once when there&#8217;s literally seconds left to play? That&#8217;s too much as well is it? Fucking hell are we trying to work counter attacks with one minute to go and 1-0 up now are we?</p>
<p>I asked before the game if we would stand up and show how much we wanted to the title and I guess we didn&#8217;t want it enough, especially not in those final few minutes. I&#8217;m not saying we didn&#8217;t try to defend but if it meant that much to us there would&#8217;ve been no team able to get through us never mind how weak our defence is. Well it didn&#8217;t happen and it ended up 1-1. I&#8217;ve almost accepted the result because it was 0-0 for so long and a draw looked likely but it&#8217;s just such a shame to take the lead and lose it like we did.</p>
<p>We dominated the most part of the game, Carroll and Suarez didn&#8217;t click and without Gerrard I&#8217;ve never really been that scared of Liverpool. We looked alright but we didn&#8217;t create enough proper goal scoring chances and<a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/-it-was-difficult-for-us-to-create-chances-"> Wenger has admitted it was a bit of a problem</a>. He also said that Liverpool had a lot of men behind the ball defending which is also true. They did make it quite difficult for us and I&#8217;m surprised they played so negatively but I guess it worked if they came for a draw.</p>
<p>Over the course of the game, other than the penalties there were only a handful of chances for either team. Liverpool had a couple of half-hearted shots and we hit the bar from a header, had one disallowed for offside and the best chance was from a little flick from Fabregas to van Persie in the area but he couldn&#8217;t score one-on-one with Reina.</p>
<p>It was a frustrating game, Liverpool didn&#8217;t deserve anything but we weren&#8217;t doing enough to take the points for ourselves. I&#8217;ll just move on to extra time because that&#8217;s where all the action was; At the 90 minute mark it looked like it was heading for 0-0 unless there could be any late drama in the 8 minutes added on for a head injury to Carragher. We won our penalty when Cesc burst into the area and was tripped whilst dribbling &#8211; definite penalty. Robin van Persie had what looked like the chance to keep us in the title race. It was a massive, massive penalty and when he sent Reina the wrong way and stuck it perfectly inside the post he ripped his shirt off and the ground went mental. It was a huge goal and one that surely, surely would win it.</p>
<p>There couldn&#8217;t have been long left to go, but we knew we were going to have to soak up a bit of Liverpool pressure. They did plough forward and we defended it but we didn&#8217;t just boot it away, instead we fucked about with it on the edge of our own box, gave it back to them and then conceded a very dangerous free kick. It was surely one of the last kicks of the game and it was too unbearable to watch for a lot of people. In the end the free kick wasn&#8217;t good but what followed was infuriating and hilarious. The ball dropped to Lucas but had no choice to run away from goal towards the left corner flag. Eboue was tracking him but for some reason far beyond my intelligence he ran into the back of him allowing him to go down for a penalty. He definitely dived and made the most of it but I probably would&#8217;ve given a penalty too, Eboue stupidly just went into the back of him.</p>
<p>I mean if he&#8217;d let him run and given it a few seconds I reckon that could&#8217;ve been it, as Lucas got the ball, referee Andre Marriner was probably thinking about blowing up. He saw the foul though and had no choice but to give the penalty. It was a chance for the returning Szczesny to make himself a hero but Kuyt scored and the final whistle blew immediately.</p>
<p>I have no qualms about the 11 minutes of added on time. It all makes perfect sense, there was a minimum of 8 minutes and then there was the foul for our penalty, the time it took to take it, the minute or two of celebrations, the minute before they took their free kick and other things it was perfectly acceptable to still be playing past the 100 minute mark in my opinion. He could&#8217;ve blown the whistle after the free kick but there was probably about four or five seconds between that being taken and Eboue&#8217;s foul.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had some terrible, terrible luck this season but I feel like a lot of bad days could&#8217;ve been avoided if we had just been more cautious. We&#8217;re very accident prone and it has ruined our season. I&#8217;m upset because I don&#8217;t know if this group of players will ever get a better chance to win the league with Chelsea being as shit as I&#8217;ve seen them since before Mourinho and Man United having terrible away form. Also I don&#8217;t know how long this group will be together also, it&#8217;s possible for quite a few players to leave this summer, some for better some for worse but what really worries me is if both Nasri and Cesc leave. We&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we come to it though.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing times yet again but we must pick ourselves up. Another loss and it really is over. Our next game is Tottenham away and how much they would like to inflict the result which ends our title hopes. We can&#8217;t let that happen, and after what happened in the home game against them this season I&#8217;m <strong>expecting</strong> the players to finally show some fight. If we can show it in just this one game then I&#8217;ll be slightly relieved.</p>
<p>We might have to win every game until the end of the season and three points at White Hart Lane is a good place to start. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/szczesny-we-owe-the-fans-a-result-at-spurs">Szczesny believes we&#8217;ve got what it takes</a>, I just hope the rest of the team does. This North London Derby is huge and I&#8217;d be lying if I&#8217;m not a little nervous.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow for the usual build up. Until then.

	<p>Sorry for the lack of posts this week, I&#8217;m going through an extremely busy period work-wise at the moment and I got a bit carried away with that. Also this is going to have to be as quick a match preview as possible because late last night I got offered a ticket for today and my train is leaving Bournemouth in an hour.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the news? <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/szczesny-looks-set-for-first-team-comeback">Szczesny, Djourou and Song are back</a> which is a big boost for the defence. We had more good news in that department this week as Vermaelen has returned to full training. He won&#8217;t be involved today because he hasn&#8217;t played in months but Wenger has changed his stance on the Belgian and says he could still play a part this season. Sagna, Ramsey and Rosicky are likely to miss out today with niggles, hopefully they&#8217;re back soon especially Sagna.</p>
<p>So with that, I see us looking like this and it looks like quite a decent side again:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Szczesny<br />
Eboue &#8211; Djourou &#8211; Koscielny &#8211; Clichy<br />
Song &#8211; Wilshere<br />
Fabregas (c)<br />
Walcott &#8211; van Persie &#8211; Nasri</span></strong></p>
<p>For once we&#8217;ve actually got options so you could see any of Arshavin, Diaby, Bendtner, Chamakh or Squillaci starting or being decent options from the bench. Apart from the injury that will keep Sagna out for the second successive game it&#8217;s been a pretty good week for injury news and I&#8217;m confident going into this afternoon&#8217;s game now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge match today, Liverpool always is but we&#8217;re very much at the business end of the season now and points are more than vital for both teams. It should be an interesting one, our recent form hasn&#8217;t been great but hopefully the win at Blackpool wil inspire a bit of confidence today. As United played in the FA Cup yesterday, today&#8217;s game will take us level on games played. A win would take us a very tasty four points off the top but a loss would leave us a very bleak seven points behind. With so few games left a result like that could mean the end. After Chelsea&#8217;s win yesterday they&#8217;re now just a point behind us too (also played one more) so we need to win to keep them off our backs also.</p>
<p>I do think we can win today and before I go I might <a href="http://www.betus.com/">bet online</a> on a 2-0 Arsenal win. If we can keep a clean sheet with that stronger looking defence then I think we&#8217;ll do it, plus the attacking threat of Walcott, Nasri, van Persie, Arshavin and Fabregas should be dangerous enough to score goals. It really could go any way but I&#8217;ve got a good feeling about today.</p>
<p>In other news well today is the 17th April 2011 and do you know what that means? It&#8217;s 50 years ago today that Tottenham last won the league. A lot has happened in 50 years, for example we&#8217;ve won the league title six times and have challenged for it for the most part of that. Today might be a nice anniversary for Spurs fans but it&#8217;s even bigger reminded for us of our dominance. &#8217;61, Never Again. I haven&#8217;t got enough time to go into this too much but I kind of feel that they don&#8217;t deserve the time anyway, just a short reminder that yet another decade has past since they won the league and we&#8217;ll carry on with our business trying to win for ourselves it yet again. Here&#8217;s to another 50 years! Hey you never know, Nike might bring our a commemorative shirt for it.</p>
<p>And on a more serious not this week saw the sad and untimely death of board member and Arsenal visionary Danny Fitszman. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-club-owes-so-much-to-danny-fiszman">The man did so much for the club</a> that he will unquestionably be remembered forever. In fact I wouldn&#8217;t be making the pilgrimage to The Emirates Stadium today if it weren&#8217;t for Danny and that legacy will live on for decades to come. I wish I had more time to pay my respects to him but I&#8217;ll try get over to <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/bridges-named-in-tribute-to-friar-and-fiszman">the newly re-named Danny Fitszman bridge</a> later today. It&#8217;s a shame that the unveiling ceremony came just too late for Danny to be there or see the plaque but plans have been in place for this for some time so he will have known that his name will be proudly imprinted on the bridge to Ashburton Grove and be seen by hundreds of thousands of fans young and old. Thank you for all you&#8217;ve done Danny, rest in peace.</p>
<p>Right I better get myself off to the station now. Lets get them three points today lads, lets do it for Danny, lets do it for the 50th anniversary, lets do it for the league title; I have a feeling today will be another test of how much we really want this.</p>
<p>COME ON YOU GUNNERS.

	<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/usmanov.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-511" title="usmanov" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/usmanov.jpg?w=450&#038;h=244" alt="" width="450" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>The future of Arsenal Football Club still hangs in the balance today. We&#8217;re still waiting on Usmanov&#8217;s next move and it&#8217;s slightly ironic that it&#8217;s his action now that will have the biggest impact on the club&#8217;s future. Kroenke has been forced to make an offer for all remaining shares, Usmanov could sell up and walk away with a profit or choose not to sell and most probably not ever move off that 27% mark. If he sells, Arsenal belongs to Kroenke, if he doesn&#8217;t then not a great deal has changed apart from the small matter of a few hundred of million pounds.</p>
<p>I was shocked last night to log onto Twitter and see the strange and sudden warming to Usmanov that was going on. Somehow Kroenke was suddenly the bad guy and Jabba the Hutt was going to be the saviour. It was quite bizarre, I don&#8217;t get how he can be genuinely getting positive spin off this. I saw some rubbish about him planning to give shares back to fans or something but I feel like I&#8217;m being a bit gullible to believe that.</p>
<p>There was an Arsenal Supporters&#8217; Trust meeting last night and there they agreed that<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/apr/12/arsenal-supporters-trust-shares-stan-kroenke"> they will not be selling up to Kroenke</a> and instead campaigning for supporter ownership. Now for that to happen we basically need Usmanov to not sell because then it would all be over. So I think this is where he has become the good guy, people need him to keep his 27% to stop a complete takeover. But then at the same time you&#8217;ve also got Kroenke saying that he doesn&#8217;t plan to take Arsenal off the stock market and he believes in the importance of small shareholder fans. There just seems to me to be too much going on, too many conflicting ideas and too many promises set up to be broken.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t decide what is best for us. Kroenke sounds like a reasonable guy and if anyone has to take us over then I guess I&#8217;d want it to be him but then I think that for Arsenal to be owned by a single owner doesn&#8217;t seem right. I feel like we&#8217;re far too important for that and once in control he has far too much power over something so precious. At the end of the day there&#8217;s not much I can do about the whole situation and in times like this in life I tend to just sit back and just let what happens happen. I don&#8217;t know what you think about that but it&#8217;s just my way of thinking, there&#8217;s no point in getting upset about something you can&#8217;t control I think. I guess I could start up or join in a campaign for or against Kroenke but I can&#8217;t decide what I want right now so I&#8217;m just going to sit on the fence and watch the world go by and wait on <em>Red &amp; White&#8217;s</em> next move.</p>
<p>There is evidence to support the theory that Usmanov won&#8217;t sell up. Upon hearing of Kroenke&#8217;s offer for Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith&#8217;s 16% the Uzbekistani offered an improved price for the stake. Stan offered £11,750 a share whereas the improved offer was £13,000 a share adding up to just under £130m for her stake. It&#8217;s a considerable offer but Lady Nina said she did not want to go back on her agreement with Stan and will be selling to him. So it does look as if Usmanov isn&#8217;t giving up just yet. We&#8217;ll see what happens in the coming days, weeks or months but at the moment no one knows what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p>Lets move on to matters <em>on</em> the pitch, after all that&#8217;s what matters most in the long run; <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wilshere-schedule-could-hamper-united">Jack Wilshere reckons Man United&#8217;s involvement in Europe will eventually effect their Premier League form</a>. He says that we have the advantage by having a week&#8217;s rest between games. This is true, however United could be out of Europe tonight if Chelsea play well at Old Trafford. It&#8217;s the second leg of their quarter final tonight, Man Utd are 1-0 up going into that but it&#8217;s not unthinkable that Chelsea can turn that around. If they do then the league leaders will be in the same position as us with a week&#8217;s rest between games and this weekend they&#8217;re playing in the FA Cup anyway so fatigue from tonight will have no effect on their league form. Plus, next week we have a midweek game against Spurs so we will be the ones without a full week&#8217;s recovery.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been hoping United progress in Europe, the only way it&#8217;s going to effect the Premier League is if they get into the semi finals. And which game falls between the two semi final legs? The one against us. So that will be an advantage knowing we&#8217;ll be more prepared for the game plus it could effect their other matches &#8211; they might be tempted to rest players against Everton the weekend before the first leg and they play Chelsea the weekend after the second leg so that might have a knock on effect there too. You&#8217;ve got to take what you can get in the season run in, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m cheering on United tonight in the hope that Europe and the league gets too much to handle.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also this story about <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/185869/Robin-Van-Persie-blasts-Abou-Diaby/?">an argument between van Persie and Diaby at half time in Blackpool</a> this weekend. I&#8217;ve never got this term &#8216;blast&#8217;. <em>&#8220;So and so BLASTS another guy!&#8221;</em> Don&#8217;t really get it, sounds a bit stupid I think. All I can imagine is van Persie with a Super Soaker in the dressing room at half time with a very wet Diaby. Anyway yeah apparently Robin was reminding Diaby about his costly red card at St. James&#8217; Park and having a go at him for picking up a silly yellow just before half time on Sunday. If true, then I guess it&#8217;s good to see that the players are passionate about these games and know the importance of them. Diaby said he would learn from his sending off against Newcastle, it changed the game resulting in disastrous circumstances so you can understand RVP&#8217;s frustration. But then again, it could all be made up bollocks.</p>
<p>Okay regular readers will know I&#8217;ve been running a competition this week to win a retro shirt from Toffs. The competition ended at midnight last night and the answer to the question: <em>What year is the earliest Arsenal shirt from that Toffs currently offer on their online store? </em> was <strong>A. 1913</strong> not B. 1927 as many people put, you need to look closer I&#8217;m afraid! There were quite a few people who got it right though and I&#8217;m going to now open a new tab and select a winner at random&#8230; LIVE. Oh how exciting.</p>
<p>And the winner is&#8230; James Warrener. Well done James, I will be in touch about choosing your shirt and getting that to you as soon as possible. Thanks to everyone for entering, I&#8217;ll try and get another competition up and running soon. I&#8217;ll also see if I can get a discount code for you guys on the Toffs store, until then though all the shirts are still available to buy if you really had your heart set on winning one you can check them out by clicking on the banner below.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for today then. It&#8217;s going to be weird cheering on Man United tonight but at the end of the day I fucking hate John Terry. So it&#8217;s acceptable.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, speak to you soon.</p>

	<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/kroenke.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" title="Stanley Kroenke" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/kroenke.jpg?w=450&#038;h=298" alt="" width="450" height="298" /></a></p>
<p>So yesterday was a pretty eventful day for Arsenal, we beat Blackpool 3-1 ending our run of draws which is pretty good but that was quickly forgotten as Stan Kroenke looks like launching a takeover of the club. The three points at Bloomfield road were vital in the short term but yesterday saw the biggest announcement financially involving Arsenal in a long time and it is set to change the future of the club. So I guess it deserves a bit of a mention&#8230;</p>
<p>Yesterday it was announced that the American would be buying out Danny Fiszman&#8217;s and Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith&#8217;s shares which bumps Kroenke up from just under 30% to nearly 63% of shares. He will now make an offer for the remaining 37% but those shareholders are currently under no obligation to sell. The majority of that 37% is held by Alisher Usmanov&#8217;s <em>Red &amp; White Holdings</em> who currently own 27% which is just enough to stop Kroenke reaching the magic 75% mark which would mean he could force any remaining shareholders to sell.</p>
<p>The ball now lies in Usmanov&#8217;s court, although Kroenke is stood waiting, racket in hand, in a much bigger court. <em>Red &amp; White</em> have no obligation to sell but they could cash in now and have made a profit on their investment or they could keep the shares but have no real say in the club or anything like that. I can&#8217;t guess what they&#8217;re going to do but it does look now that sooner or later Arsenal will become yet another club to be owned solely by an investor. I&#8217;m no financial expert whatsoever and I&#8217;ve never really had much to say on this whole business in the last couple of years. Partly because I don&#8217;t understand the stock market well enough and secondly because it&#8217;s out of our hands really, whatever happens will happen and we&#8217;ll just have to accept it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m perfectly happy with the club being run as it has been for years, with the club jointly owned by numerous shareholders. I&#8217;ve never really properly thought about what it would be like under a single owner but it does seem that if it is going to happen then Stan Kroenke is probably the best man for the job. He wants to keep the current board, he will make no personnel changes there although they would no longer be shareholders of the club &#8211; just employees, he has also promised not to put further debt to the club&#8217;s name by using loans to complete the buyout and the man has plenty of experience in owning sports clubs. He currently owns a club in just about every top sport in America including our US football partners the Colorado Rapids. He will also bring valuable input into our commercial sector which will be used to grow the worldwide brand of Arsenal to generate revenue, that will mean pre-season tours in places like Asia and America rather than our usual low-key Austrian training camp. I know already we had plans to tour Japan and surrounding countries this summer but I think that might be falling through after the recent disaster there. This isn&#8217;t a Chelsea or Man City style takeover though, we might see some cash investment in terms of transfers but don&#8217;t expect him to be our Abramovich or anything like that. I think Kroenke will be a lot more sensible and will be looking at the long-term future of the club rather than short-term investment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very early days but it does look very much like the beginning of a takeover. The next step now is to see how Usmanov reacts to this, he could sell up to Kroenke and be on his way, he could stay put and decide not to sell or he could launch a counter bid. Now as accepting as I am with all this news, a takeover attempt from Usmanov would not be anywhere near as welcome and would cause up quite a stir. I&#8217;m not sure if he&#8217;s actually eligible to buy Fiszman&#8217;s shares as part of the lockdown agreement anyway though but I&#8217;m not exactly sure how all of this works as I mentioned.</p>
<p>Lets move on anyway and leave it at that. Those are the facts and that&#8217;s that for the moment. I don&#8217;t want to dig too far into it because not only is my knowledge going to get badly shown up but we have a game to discuss!</p>
<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/samir-nasri-robin-van-persie-rvp-blackpool.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3153" title="samir nasri robin van persie rvp blackpool" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/samir-nasri-robin-van-persie-rvp-blackpool.jpg?w=450&#038;h=247" alt="" width="450" height="247" /></a></p>
<p>So three points then yesterday and we&#8217;re back on track. There were no slip-ups from United or Chelsea so our position in the table is unchanged but we kept up the pace which was important. We&#8217;re still seven points off the leaders with that game in hand. Dropped points yesterday would&#8217;ve been a disaster but we&#8217;re still there going into two massive games against Liverpool and Tottenham.</p>
<p>You could say we were a little bit lucky yesterday but I feel like we&#8217;ve deserved a bit of luck recently. We did well to get an early two goal lead but when we inevitably let the home side back in it we were on the ropes for a while and did well not to concede. I guess if you&#8217;re a Blackpool fan you&#8217;d be livid at the chances missed yesterday or the lack of penalties given but for once luck was on our side.</p>
<p>We never should&#8217;ve got into that situation though. Blackpool started the better side but we went 1-0 up in the 17th minute and doubled the lead three minutes later. Diaby almost lost the ball just outside our box but managed to win it back and the ball found its way out to van Persie on the left who took it into the box and put a great ball across to Diaby who had carried on his run and tapped it in for 1-0.  In the 20th minute a great pass and move on the right and drive into the box from Eboue put him in a shooting position and what a clinical shot it was with the left foot to make to 2-0. Two unlikely goal scorers but two great goals and we had a (fairly) comfortable two nil lead. We really should&#8217;ve gone in at half time about 4-0 up though, we dominated for the most part and thanks to some good goalkeeping, a bit of luck and us not getting a shot away when we should&#8217;ve done, Blackpool kept it at 2-0 until half time. Nasri will be disappointed not to have scored yesterday and Robin will fell like he could&#8217;ve had more too.</p>
<p>After missing all those chances to put the game to bed it was inevitable that Blackpool would find a way back into it. They ended the first half well and carried that on into the second. Five minutes into the half they got one back, Taylor-Fletcher the scorer after the referee played two advantages in the build up, one of which was Lehmann bringing down DJ Campbell in the area before the ball was put in the net. With no &#8216;keeper on the bench Less Mason could&#8217;ve easily sent the German off and left us in a bit of trouble but thankfully he allowed play on and didn&#8217;t go back to book Jens. Almunia was apparently injured in the warm up handing Jens a shock 200th appearance for Arsenal, which meant there was no goalie on the bench and afterwards Robin van Persie said he would&#8217;ve been putting on the gloves if Lehmann was sent off. As exciting as that would&#8217;ve been I&#8217;m glad it didn&#8217;t materialise!</p>
<p>As to be expected, an extended period of Blackpool pressure followed that goal and on another day we might&#8217;ve gone back to 2-2. Had that been the case and we ended up drawing I think we might&#8217;ve been waving goodbye to the title so I&#8217;m glad we held out. Wenger brought on Walcott after an hour in an attempt to keep the home side back or catch them on the break and it was the latter that worked in the 75th minute. Squillaci made a good tackle at the back and gave it to Diaby who showed good strength to keep the ball and turn up the pitch clipping it to Fabregas, he touched it first time on to Theo who was away down the wing and in a matter of seconds we had turned danger into attack. Walcott was in loads of space running freely towards goal, RVP kept up the pace and Theo was able to pick him out with a good ball and Robin made it 3-1. Game over.</p>
<p>There was still time for one last shock, Gael Clichy got caught in possession on the edge of the box but Lehmann did well to come out and get a good block on the shot showing that he&#8217;s still got what it takes after an otherwise fairly quiet game.</p>
<p>So next Sunday we face Liverpool at home and what a game that is set to be. I have to say I fancy us and hopefully we could have some players returning from injury next week. If we&#8217;re lucky we could have all of Szczesny, Djourou, Sagna and Song back making us a lot stronger in defence &#8211; or certainly less for us to worry about! Plenty of build up to that to come plus undoubtedly more news on the takeover situation. We haven&#8217;t got a game in 6 days but it&#8217;s set to be a busy week. Come back tomorrow where I will be announcing the winner of <a href="http://the-cannon.com/2011/04/08/competition-win-a-toffs-retro-arsenal-shirt/">the Toffs competition</a>, you have until midnight tonight to enter that one so make sure you get your emails in if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, speak to you tomorrow.

	<p>Tottenham fans sang &#8220;Are you watching Arsenal?&#8221; as they progressed into the quarter finals of the Champions League after a famous 0-0 home draw against AC Milan as we had been knocked out a day earlier to Barcelona. Yes, we were watching and we fully expected you to progress against of the weakest AC Milan sides in years. We were also watching when you played Inter Milan in the group stages; again, a big name side but one showing the decline in Italian football proven by the hammering they took from Schalke last night. We were watching again last night as you found out what the Champions league is <em>really</em> about. I&#8217;ve been anticipating this game for a while to see how Spurs got on against a side as tough as we face year in year out, and they flopped as expected.</p>
<p>Yeah Tottenham fans reading this will probably go straight to the comments section with something like &#8216;We got further than you lot! COYS!&#8217; but you played fucking AC Milan and we played Barcelona, bit of a difference there. And in Barcelona we gave them a game for the majority of the match. Until Robin van Persie was sent off we were holding out their attacks and we could&#8217;ve gone through, it didn&#8217;t work out in the end and these things happen. However now Spurs now know what it&#8217;s like to play in Spain with 10 men and they got <del>walked over</del> trampled on. The 4-0 loss renders the 2nd leg pretty much useless, they might get a memorable goal but they&#8217;re not going to beat Real Madrid by a four goal margin. Not in a million years.</p>
<p>This day has been a long time coming, the day when Spurs found out just how hard the Champions League really is. It&#8217;s exciting, but bloody difficult. What&#8217;s also pretty hilarious is shouts of &#8216;We&#8217;re gonna win it&#8217; and &#8216;Bring on Barcelona!&#8217; from a few weeks ago have turned to &#8216;Redknapp out! He hasn&#8217;t got a clue.&#8217; Brilliant. I can empathise with Tottenham fans, this year must&#8217;ve been exciting for them but I hope it&#8217;s their last. There&#8217;s a good chance they wont make it into Champions League next season and be back on Channel 5 where they belong. There&#8217;s one thing I enjoy nearly as much as an Arsenal win and that&#8217;s a Tottenham failure. And seeing as I haven&#8217;t seen us win for a while I&#8217;m going to enjoy this for a little bit!</p>
<p>Yeah you&#8217;ll probably think I&#8217;m bitter or whatever, frankly I don&#8217;t care. Football is there to be enjoyed and this is how I&#8217;m going to enjoy it. And don&#8217;t you dare bring up the whole representing Britain bullshit.</p>
<p>Anyway moving on to Arsenal and there really isn&#8217;t a lot to talk about hence the Spurs rant. It&#8217;s all gone a bit quiet which is probably the best thing after a third disappointing draw in a row, so you have to enjoy the little things like last night, just as much as they would&#8217;ve enjoyed our night in Spain. Unlike Tottenham, we&#8217;re still in a title race and I&#8217;m not going to give that up just yet, I&#8217;m enjoying it too much. Yeah we might have slipped up a little but I&#8217;m still hoping there&#8217;s room for United to do the same. They play Chelsea tonight in the Champions League and I&#8217;m hoping that will have some knock on effect for their weekend league game.  It&#8217;s a slim hope though, their game this weekend is at home to Fulham; one look at <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/page/FormGuide#">the form guide</a> shows that they haven&#8217;t won in their last five away games and it also shows that Man United have won all five of their most recent home matches. According to the stats it doesn&#8217;t look good, I&#8217;m expecting another three points for the league leaders but anything other than that would be a massive bonus.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re away to Blackpool who sit 18th in the form table but will be difficult to beat at their own ground. We&#8217;ll go into the game conscious of the fact we haven&#8217;t won in three games but this weekend is the time to rectify that. To put it simply, if we don&#8217;t then we&#8217;re out. I&#8217;m not saying we have to win every single game from here on in but if we don&#8217;t beat the lesser teams we have to play then we don&#8217;t give ourselves much of a chance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try and stay positive for the rest of the season. I was quite critical in my last post and I think rightly so but hopefully <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6852802,00.html">this week is a week for Wenger to sort things out with the team</a>, get the most out of players and make sure we perform to our best again. We need to win on Sunday and I&#8217;m sure Wenger will be doing everything possible to make that happen this week. You have to be critical of the manager and players sometimes but now is the time to just get behind them and see what they can do in these 8 remaining games. The summer is the time to judge the team and that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;ll do, I think there is room for change this close season but there&#8217;s nothing we can do now so just get behind the lads, please.</p>
<p>The only news worth mentioning is <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6853744,00.html">Samir Nasri&#8217;s agent denying there has been contact from Italy</a> about a move and saying he is happy in London. All this whilst a deal is still yet to be signed and he is just a year away from the end of his contract. I have no idea what&#8217;s going on there, whether Samir wants more money, his agent does, he&#8217;s had enough of this team, wants to play elsewhere or what the problem is, but there must be some issue otherwise he should&#8217;ve singed on by now. I&#8217;m praying a deal can be sorted because the loss of both him and Fabregas would be huge blow and I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;d deal with it. I don&#8217;t want us to get to the situation where we have to decide whether to sell him this summer or keep him for one more year and let him go for free. Only Samir, his agent and Arsene Wenger know what&#8217;s going on but hopefully something will be sorted. After all, his agent does say in that link that he is happy here so hopefully that is the case.</p>
<p>There are also doubts over Gael Clichy&#8217;s future after he pulled out of talks last week. A move away has been on the cards for a while and as dodgy as he can be sometimes I&#8217;d be a little bit gutted if he left. I&#8217;ve always quite liked him and he&#8217;s shown this season that he can perform near his best but maybe his consistency has run out. I guess it&#8217;s up to the manager but I fell like we&#8217;re changing our defence far too much at the moment and a bit of familiarity would be good for us. More on those two stories as they develop.</p>
<p>Okay that&#8217;s it for today. More looking forward to the weekend&#8217;s game in Blackpool to come this week. Thanks for reading.

	<p>Well yesterday was a shit day to say the least. Watching West Ham go 2-0 up on United I was suddenly optimistic about the day&#8217;s football ahead but the league leaders showed exactly the sort of spirit, desire and fight that we so very rarely show. Arsene always goes on about our &#8216;spirit&#8217; and our infamous &#8216;mental strength&#8217; but more times than not I believe he&#8217;s saying that in order to make it seem true. I hate it immeasurably but we have one of the worst &#8216;spirits&#8217; in the league.</p>
<p>It makes me quite sad that we&#8217;re in this title fight yet there is no &#8216;fight&#8217; about us at all. We&#8217;re lacking leadership and togetherness and no matter how many times the manager comes out in a post match interview using those words I&#8217;m still unconvinced. The West Ham vs. Man United game was similar to our game at the Hawthorns a couple of weeks ago but United did what we should&#8217;ve done that day and showed our superior class and quality to win the game comfortably. Arsene praised the lads for coming back from 2-0 down against West brom but frankly we should never have been in that position in the first place and we didn&#8217;t do enough to come back and win. I don&#8217;t want to sound greedy but if we want to consider ourselves Champions we have to do what United did yesterday. So as you know, they won and we coughed out another draw to fall now seven points behind. My response yesterday was:</p>

<p>That might sound a little harsh but it&#8217;s true. Until Man United drop points we are out of this title race, seven points is a huge gap when you&#8217;re talking about a team of their quality and as you can see there&#8217;s only us and Chelsea you can see them dropping points against &#8211; and I&#8217;m not very confident about May 1st:</p>
<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/fixture-run-in.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3076" title="fixture run in" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/fixture-run-in.jpg?w=457&#038;h=360" alt="" width="457" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>We knew the run in favoured them so we knew we needed to make sure we pick up three points on every possible occasion. However from being neck and neck we&#8217;ve absolutely blown it with three draws in a row against Sunderland, West Brom and Blackburn. I had us nailed on for 9 points there and I think those 6 points dropped are what will lose us the title.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t blame people for not wanting to read the Arsenal news today but those of you that are here I apologise for the negativity today I&#8217;m just being honest &#8211; I think it&#8217;s over. Unless United have some kind of collapse or drop in form it&#8217;s looking too hard for us now. I am ever the optimist but I&#8217;m also a realist. If we win our game in hand at White Hart Lane and somehow manage to beat Man Utd then we&#8217;ll be just a point behind them but who knows if we&#8217;ll still even be seven points behind them when it comes to then; one point doesn&#8217;t sound like much but that&#8217;s assuming we win all of our other games and I just don&#8217;t see that happening at all.</p>
<p>I should probably move on to the game yesterday, but hopefully you&#8217;ll excuse me today for looking at the big picture. I really thought we were going to win you know, with all those players back returning from injury I thought we&#8217;d find what was needed and do the job with relative ease. We started really well but one break in play was enough Blackburn needed to get back in the game. It was a bad tackle on I think Sagna that had two players down for around three minutes and the rush of energy was broken, Blackburn could take it to half time at 0-0 and from there on it always looked like being a draw. It&#8217;s like we gave up after that initial first period, it sounds crazy but it looked to me a little like we couldn&#8217;t score when we were playing well to begin with so gave up thinking we could do it. This &#8216;belief&#8217; that Wenger says we have is not translating itself to the pitch.</p>
<p>I spoke before the game about us having to dig deep and play well. And we didn&#8217;t. I also spoke about how the crowd needs to get behind the team. And we didn&#8217;t. I wasn&#8217;t there yesterday but I know what it&#8217;s like when the team isn&#8217;t performing it&#8217;s easy to just sit there and sulk about the performance. A lack of inspiration on the field is quite contagious and can easily transfer to the fans. I just disappointed that, that happened though. We&#8217;re in a title fight for God&#8217;s sake and if we can&#8217;t cheer, sing and get behind the team now then when are we ever going to? It&#8217;s sad, it really is.</p>
<p>The same goes for the team though. It&#8217;s really exciting and uplifting just being involved in the title race but when you see the players on the pitch not giving everything for the cause it&#8217;s depressing. I&#8217;m so sad we haven&#8217;t shown the desire that say Man United do in this time of importance. I really thought that we had what it takes to do this but after three bad draws I question the ability of this team. I&#8217;m sorry for not talking about much of the game itself but hopefully you&#8217;ll excuse me for that. I just did watch it but thinking back to the game is still pissing me off.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still hoping but for today I am going to sulk. We&#8217;re still in there and I still hope we can turn it around but today I will be like a Mother who&#8217;s child has forgot to send that card &#8211; not angry, just disappointed.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, lets hope for a more positive week of blogging.

	<p>Things are really heating up in this title race now, we lost ground on Man United last weekend so we need to make sure we don&#8217;t drop points two games in a row otherwise we could find ourselves out of this race very quickly indeed. Man United kick off at West Ham now and if they manage to win there we will be 8 points behind the leaders going into our 5.30pm kick off this evening. In that scenario a win for us would take us back to 5 points behind with that game against Spurs in hand but if United do win I think a draw or loss for us today could be devastating.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking at this optimistically though. United lost 4-0 there in November in the Carling Cup and I don&#8217;t think they will find it easy at Upton Park today. It&#8217;s a ground where any team can drop points and West Ham will be well up for this one. I wouldn&#8217;t like to bet on this being a win, loss or a draw today &#8211; it&#8217;s one of those ones that could go either way but I&#8217;m hoping the Hammers can do us a favour and help us make some ground on the league leaders. It&#8217;s one of United&#8217;s <a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/fixture-run-in.jpg">remaining fixtures</a> that I picked out as a potential day for dropped points and to be honest there isn&#8217;t a lot of those days so I&#8217;m really hoping West Ham can get something.</p>
<p>However whatever happens there we need to do the business ourselves. Whatever the result at Upton Park 3 points it&#8217;s absolutely vital for us. We just have to win as many as we can until the end of the season to give us a chance and I believe we should be winning today. Blackburn haven&#8217;t won at the Emirates in their last four visits and they&#8217;re currently without a win in seven league matches leaving them a point off the relegation zone. Now if you&#8217;re a team that&#8217;s looking to win the league like Arsenal &#8211; you have to take advantage of that and make sure you win.</p>
<p>The team news is good. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/van-persie-passed-fit-to-face-blackburn">RVP, Cesc, Walcott, Song, Diaby and Bendtner are all in the squad</a>, just Aaron Ramsey and Denilson miss out; the new Wales captain has picked up a groin strain but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s anything to worry about too much. The return of Fabregas, Walcott and Song is a huge, huge boost. It&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ve been missing in recent weeks; the skill, vision and passion of the captain, the pace and danger of Theo and a bit of stability in defense and midfield from Song. With those three back, I fancy our chances a lot more. We&#8217;ve really missed them in recent weeks and where we&#8217;ve dropped points at West Brom and Sunderland I think they probably could&#8217;ve been avoided with those three in the side. It gives the line up a more familiar look, more stability yet more danger going forward and this afternoon I think it will look something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:red;">Almunia<br />
Sagna &#8211; Squillaci &#8211; Koscielny &#8211; Clichy<br />
Song &#8211; Wilshere<br />
Fabregas (c)<br />
Walcott &#8211; van Persie &#8211; Nasri</span></strong></p>
<p>Other than the goalkeeper and centre backs that&#8217;s the best side we have, however with Song back those three will get more cover. I&#8217;ve got my fingers crossed that Almunia is going to have one of his good days, he&#8217;s shown he can do it he just needs to concentrate and make no more silly errors. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-almunia-will-play-on-saturday">He&#8217;s got the backing of the manager</a> and a mad German waiting in the wings if he slips up again.</p>
<p>Blackburn have got some injury boosts of their own. David Dunn, Samba and Phil Jones are all back in the side. They&#8217;re now too somewhere near their strongest XI but I still think/hope we are better than them and will take the three points today. It&#8217;s great to be able to type that front line up of Walcott, van Persie and Nasri with Fabregas behind once again, that four will threaten any defense around and I think that will be what wins us the points today. I can see us conceding but I fancy us to score at least a couple ourselves today.</p>
<p>The time to start digging in was ages ago but today it&#8217;s another massive day for Arsenal. The players need to be giving their all now every single week. The fans too, we need to support the boys, get behind the team and shout and scream us all the way over the finish line. Emphasis on that word &#8216;support&#8217; there, now is not the time to be criticizing and moaning &#8211; that&#8217;s not going to achieve anything. We just have to get behind them whoever is out there on the pitch. I&#8217;m talking about people like Almunia, he might not be the most popular of guys at the moment but he&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got and we have to try and give him some confidence. I&#8217;m hoping that there will be a decent atmosphere inside the ground today, we&#8217;re at the stage now where every game is huge and I&#8217;m hoping that&#8217;s enough to generate some decent noise today.</p>
<p>The United vs. West Ham game has just kicked off so I&#8217;m going to wrap this up and go watch that. It&#8217;s set to be another exciting afternoon of Premier League football, I&#8217;ve missed it. Come on West Ham, come on Arsenal, lets do it.</p>
<p>Enjoy the game.

	<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/jack-wilshere-england.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3120" title="jack wilshere england" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/jack-wilshere-england.jpg?w=450&#038;h=247" alt="" width="450" height="247" /></a></p>
<p>Did everyone have fun in the international break? No, neither did I. I watched England&#8217;s game with Wales and most of their game with Ghana but I still wasn&#8217;t convinced I&#8217;m much of an international fan. I mean if I can&#8217;t celebrate our goals then something must be wrong, right? It was good to see Jack Wilshere involved though but I spent most of the time worrying he&#8217;d get injured off one of the many hard tackles flying in on him. He does seem to attract bad challenges but luckily he gets up every time, I just wince every time I see someone go in though hoping that it&#8217;s not this one that breaks him. He came through it though and as far as I&#8217;m aware he&#8217;s good to go for the weekend.</p>
<p>There were fresh quotes on Jack&#8217;s potential involvement in this summer&#8217;s U21 Euro Championships. As you would expect Wenger doesn&#8217;t want him to go for fear of burning him out but <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6843136,00.html">it looks like he wants to play</a>; and there&#8217;s not a lot we can do about that I&#8217;m afraid. He&#8217;s had a busy season this year and it&#8217;s his first full season too, the rest this summer would be really beneficial to him and we&#8217;ve seen time and time again what it can do to players who don&#8217;t get a proper rest. Fabregas and Walcott are most recent examples of our players that have devoted that extra time to playing for their country and it has affected their fitness badly. For once it looks like we have a player that can actually stay fit but I don&#8217;t want that to change simply down to a passion to play.</p>
<p>He says he&#8217;s going to talk to Stuart Pearce, Fabio Capello and Arsene Wenger about it but I don&#8217;t think anything will change. <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6839912,00.html">Stuart Pearce wants the best squad available to him</a> and Capello will see it as beneficial for England &#8211; neither of them care one bit how it will affect Arsenal. Why should they really? England is their concern and any other team their players play for has nothing to do with them. Arsene will argue our case but I don&#8217;t see him stamping his foot down and refusing to let Wilshere go, that could piss Jack off and you don&#8217;t want an unhappy player. Maybe right now all he wants to do is play games but I don&#8217;t want this to be something he&#8217;ll look back on and think maybe he should&#8217;ve sat it out.</p>
<p>On the subject of Jack Wilshere, <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3501217/England-soccer-sensation-Jack-Wilshere-is-to-have-a-child-at-19-with-his-ex-Lauren-Neal-22.html">It appears he might be becoming a father at 19</a>. No idea how valid that Sun article is but if so I guess congratulations are in order.</p>
<p>Any international break would not be complete without a Robin van Persie injury scare. He scored for Holland as they beat Hungary 5-3 but was withdrawn at half time after taking a knock in the first period. All our players will be back at London Colney today so we will be making our own assessments and I expect confirmation on his condition today or tomorrow. Fingers crossed because we really need him now. From what I’ve read and seen it looks like it could just be a bad dead leg but you never know with van Persie&#8230; We&#8217;re just going to have to wait and see, I&#8217;m eager for a story to pop up on Arsenal.com any minute but I guess no news is good news right? Please Robin, be ok.</p>
<p>If he pulls through then I think we may have passed an international period injury free. I don&#8217;t want to say that with too much confidence just yet but there is a chance we may have seen a miracle before our very eyes. I spoke previously about Bendtner twisting his ankle but it turned out to be okay and he ended up playing 90 minutes at the weekend and 76 minutes on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Jens Lehmann was also in action this week, he played for the Arsenal reserves who lost to Wigan 2-1 after Ignasi Miquel&#8217;s red card. If you read our official match report it sounds like it was a solid comeback for Jens but read it anywhere else and it sounds like he had a dodgy game. Apparently he went rushing out for some ridiculous ball Almunia-style and only escaped conceding thanks to a goal line clearance. I don&#8217;t expect Arsenal.com to slate any of our own players so it&#8217;s to be expected that they reported the game in the way that they did. What should be clear though is that Lehmann is not the answer to our problems, he&#8217;s simply a reserve &#8216;keeper and I&#8217;d be very surprised to see him start ahead of Almunia this weekend. No matter what happened in the game, conceding two goals to Wigan&#8217;s reserve is hardly something to be proud of. Aliadiere also started for our reserves on Tuesday, he&#8217;s back at the club trying to get some fitness but some of the things I&#8217;ve read sound like he&#8217;s desperate for an official move back to Arsenal. Now as nice a guy as he might be, if Middlesbrough don&#8217;t want him then surely Arsene isn&#8217;t mad enough to be tempted by that one. I know he&#8217;s made some odd signings in recent years but Arsene, not this time please.</p>
<p>So in a couple of days time we play Blackburn and it&#8217;s back to the title race. I can&#8217;t wait. We&#8217;ve been away from Premiership football for too long and I&#8217;m glad there are no more pointless breaks between now and the end of the season. Going into the game we will already know how Man United have done as they play at Upton Park in Saturday&#8217;s early kick off. West Ham have a knack of getting points off them so I&#8217;m hoping they can do us another favour this weekend. If we can close the gap this weekend it will be a massive boost. More on this game in the next couple of days.</p>
<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/rip-rocky-rocastle-division-one-trophey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1616" title="david rocky rocastle" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/rip-rocky-rocastle-division-one-trophey.jpg?w=450&#038;h=711" alt="" width="450" height="711" /></a></p>
<p>Now before I go it&#8217;s time to pay some respects. As I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re well aware today is the 10th anniversary of David Rocastle&#8217;s death and it is a day of mourning for Arsenal Football Club. A true great of not just of the club but also the game, was lost to cancer at the age of just 33. There are many tributes doing the rounds on Arsenal blogs today but I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t offer you anything as good here; as much as I try I can&#8217;t remember ever watching him live as a kid. I was quite young when he was still playing for The Arsenal and even watching back old clips of him in action doesn&#8217;t rekindle any memories. I remember his death though, it was a very sad time and I remember being told that an important Arsenal legend had died. I think it&#8217;s a real shame personally that I can&#8217;t remember his playing days because he was so highly regarded by fans it would be nice to have something to think back to. However it shows the nature of Arsenal Football Club that his name is still sung proudly around Ashburton Grove and many of those voices are probably in a similiar position to me. It is a true loss to the Arsenal family and that can&#8217;t be escaped, no matter that I cannot remember him personally I still feel a connection to him through the Arsenal family.</p>
<p>There is some great stuff on the Arsenal website today to remember Rocky. There are some touching videos <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/reserves-news/remembering-rocky...-a-true-arsenal-legend">here</a> and a great photo album <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/david-rocastle-picture-gallery">here</a>.</p>
<p>10 years on and he is still remembered and celebrated as a true great of Arsenal Football Club. RIP David.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Oh Rocky, Rocky! Rocky, Rocky, Rocky Rocastle!&#8221;</span></strong></p>

	<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/bendtner-goal-hull.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1369" title="bendtner-goal-hull" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/bendtner-goal-hull.jpg?w=300&#038;h=154" alt="" width="300" height="154" /></a>It was inevitable really, wasn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>I had hopes that we might escape just this one international period without injury but just three days into the break we have a player being taken to hospital. <a href="http://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/fodbold/landsholdsfodbold/em2012/article1524169.ece">Nicklas Bendtner has twisted his ankle in training for Denmark</a>. The striker was doing shooting practice when he picked up the strain and had an ice pack on the ankle immediately. He was soon taken to hospital for scans and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s nothing too serious.</p>
<p>The one thing we need at the moment is numbers, we cannot afford to deplete our squad any further. Whatever you think of Nicklas he will be vital to the run in, he got an assist for the equalizer at the weekend and he&#8217;s great to have in the box when chasing goal. Striker is the one position where we don&#8217;t have too many injuries but we know how quickly that can change, I&#8217;m hoping Nick has had nothing more than a nasty fall and he&#8217;s back out playing for Denmark as soon as possible; after all he could do with the match practice and a good performance for his national side could bring him back to Arsenal with even more confidence.</p>
<p>I expect we&#8217;ll hear news on his ankle in the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/eduardo-djourou-shakhtar-donetsk.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2860" title="eduardo djourou Shakhtar Donetsk" src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/eduardo-djourou-shakhtar-donetsk.jpg?w=300&#038;h=150" alt="" width="300" height="150" /></a>Moving on to another injury and I got a bit of a shock yesterday when I saw<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/RealRomfordPele/status/50222714778157056"> Ray Parlour declare Djourou out for the season on his twitter</a> after a trip to the training ground. However in the afternoon news went up on the Arsenal website that his shoulder isn&#8217;t looking too bad and <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/djourou-out-for-minimum-of-four-weeks">he&#8217;ll be back in training in a month</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know who to believe to be honest, the optimist in me wants me to believe Arsenal.com because a return before the end of the season for Johan would be a big boost. However I know that you have to take any &#8216;official&#8217; Arsenal injury news with a pinch of salt so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the Romford Pele knows more than Arsenal are letting on. I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Also on twitter yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/53Szczesny53/status/50258323412492288">Szczesny was saying he&#8217;s got a scan on his finger on April 5th</a>. That date represents exactly 4 weeks since the Barcelona game where the injury was picked up and then he says if it&#8217;s good news then it&#8217;ll be two weeks before he can go back to full training. So in an ideal scenario he could return for the Spurs game which is 6 weeks and 1 day since the injury but I wouldn&#8217;t get your hopes up so soon, lets wait a couple of weeks and see how the scan goes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/szczesny-i-m-still-training-despite-injury">He has still been training though</a>. His finger is only in a splint so it&#8217;s not stopping him from getting down to London Colney and working on his distribution and a bit of gym work. Good to see he&#8217;s still busy. His kicking is probably the weakest point of his game so I&#8217;m glad to see he&#8217;s using this time to work on it.</p>
<p>By the way I&#8217;ve compiled a list of all the Arsenal players on twitter and you can view that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/the_cannon/players">here</a>. It&#8217;s pretty handy for getting early injury news like that but also having the chance to win <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cesc4official/status/50253389774336000">great competitions</a> and learning that<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jack_wilshere/status/50304887531122689"> Jack Wilshere loves a bit of Gossip Girl</a>.</p>
<p>In other news <a href="http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11670_6830069,00.html">Alisher Usmanov has upped his stake in Arsenal</a> but only by a small margin and I have to admit I&#8217;m a lot less worried about Jabba the Hutt taking over the club than I was about three years ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/37546/international-watch">We&#8217;ve got 14 players away on international duty</a>, that&#8217;s one down and 13 to go. Keep them fingers crossed. Unless you&#8217;re Wojciech Szczesny of course and leave them fingers alone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a nice day in Bournemouth today so I think I&#8217;m gonna head down to the beach. I&#8217;m out of here, thanks for reading.

<p><a href="http://the-cannon.com/2011/02/08/newcastle-thoughts-bergkamp-new-ajax-assistant-201112-home-shirt-photo/">I did previously link to another leaked photo</a> but it now looks like our new  home kit could be this. Emphasis on the word &#8216;could&#8217;, I have no idea how genuine these are but they look pretty real to me.</p>
<p>If this is the real deal, I guess i like it but I doubt I&#8217;ll be buying it. It&#8217;s too similar to our current shirt (which I love) and I don&#8217;t really see the need to spend £50 just to get a shirt that has got some leaves round the badge. It&#8217;s nice, don&#8217;t get me wrong but I dunno I kind of expected something a bit more special. It says &#8216;Arsenal&#8217; though so I guess that&#8217;s all you can ask for with an anniversary kit.</p>
<p>I guess we&#8217;ll get confirmation on the new kits in the summer but until then this might be what we&#8217;re wearing next season. It would look good with some red and white stripy socks and matching gold Premier League patches on the sleeves&#8230;</p>
<p>As for the away, well Arseblogger said on his twitter that the new away could be based on this blue lightning kit from 1995:</p>
<p><a href="http://the-cannon.com/kits"><img src="http://thecannon.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/1995-96homeaway.jpg?w=460" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>That could be interesting! I had that kit when I was a boy with Wright 8 on the back so I&#8217;d be tempted to get that again over the home. We&#8217;ll see ay.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the first day of the international break, our players will be jetting home to reunite with their national teams. It might be awkward but remember to keep those fingers crossed for two solid weeks in the hope that we get no more injuries. News is going to be pretty slow Arsenal-wise so I&#8217;ll try my best to keep the site updated in the meantime, but I guess no news is good news.</p>

<p>Another match, another disappointment, another drama. Well it would just be boring if we strolled to a win every week wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>We could&#8217;ve really done with a win yesterday to end the bad spell we&#8217;ve been on and go into the International break with our confidence back but in the end we were lucky not to lose. A draw is a bad result but with the circumstances yesterday I suppose it&#8217;s not the end of the world; it could&#8217;ve been much better but it could&#8217;ve been a lot, lot worse. At 2-0 down I didn&#8217;t think we were coming back and I said to myself I&#8217;d be happy with a draw so I guess I can&#8217;t complain too much. We had chances to win it at the end and a goal then would&#8217;ve been absolutely massive but it didn&#8217;t come so I guess we just need to be glad we didn&#8217;t drop all three points. We&#8217;re still in the race for the moment.</p>
<p>My day started at half 11, getting the train up to Birmingham. The city centre was a loony bin; I saw all kinds of lunatics in my 10 minute walk from Birmingham New Street station to Birmingham Moor Street station than you&#8217;d see in a week in London. Well I guess that depends where you go! But little did I know the craziest motherfucker was to come, a crazy Spaniard about an hour into the match itself&#8230;</p>
<p>I got to The Hawthorns pretty early, I was there just after 1 o&#8217;clock and I was surprised to see the West Brom players walking to the stadium from the facility over the road. Good for the home fans getting a few autographs and that, bad for me as I had to endure the deformed face of Scott Carson up close. I stayed though to see if Carlos Vela was about and then hung around to see the Arsenal coach arrive and watch the players get off the bus. It&#8217;s not a sight I get to see much anymore, I used to watch the players get off the coach at Highbury, quite liked cheering the players in. Anyway if you&#8217;re interested you can watch a video of them arriving <a href="http://yfrog.com/j6ug7z">here</a>. It was my first glimpse of the man, the legend &#8211; Jens Lehmann.</p>
<p>Inside the ground they were showing Tottenham vs. West Ham which was quite inspiring for <del>a few</del> lots of anti-Spurs chanting. A West Ham goal would&#8217;ve gone down a treat, and despite at half time the West Brom big screen saying The Hammers won 1-0, it was not the case and it finished 0-0. Nice to see them dropping points as always and we made our way to our seats in high spirits.</p>
<p>Whilst watching the scum I received the team news that Ramsey was starting via some kid in front of me jumping up screaming as if we&#8217;d just scored a cup final winning goal. I mean I understand he is liked amongst fans but fuck me that was an over reaction to 21-year-old who hasn&#8217;t started a Premier League game in over a year. I don’t know, maybe he had twenty quid on Aaron starting, then the reaction might&#8217;ve made sense. I was there at Stoke when he was Shawcrossed so I feel a sense of attachment to him too but I don&#8217;t exactly think he&#8217;s going to be our saviour right now. Aaron was joined in midfield by the defensive (and I use that term very loosely) partnership of Denilson and Wilshere.</p>
<p>Denilson has been bad recently but fuck me he was awful yesterday. He couldn&#8217;t hit a pass with any accuracy, conviction or creation. He looks like he&#8217;s completely lost any confidence and his defending was even worse. His idea of defence is loose your man, chase back and him then foul him. Surely he can&#8217;t play again this season and I&#8217;m glad Wenger shared my view as he was brought off at half time.</p>
<p>Any good feelings about the game or hysteria about Aaron Ramsey&#8217;s start were quickly diminished. West Brom won an early corner and Reid beat none other than Ramsey to the header and they were 1-0 up after two minutes. I wonder how that kid felt about his favourite Welshman now. Not a lot you can say about the goal, it was a good corner and a good header, I thought we could&#8217;ve done better to not concede the set piece in the first place, Sagna missed the clearance completely giving Koscielny no choice but to nod it out.</p>
<p>We only really had one chance to reply in the first half. Clichy put in a good cross to van Persie who&#8217;s looping header hit the bar and fell to Ramsey who couldn&#8217;t put it in from 3 yards out. Carson did well to get a block in but I hoped Aaron might&#8217;ve placed it in the corner rather than hitting it straight at the &#8216;keeper.</p>
<p>At half time we found ourselves in a very similar situation to 2004. Having just been knocked out of the FA Cup and Champions League we were trailing to Liverpool in the league and needed a big second half performance. Apparently that day Thierry Henry had some inspirational words to say in the Highbury dressing room but yesterday I couldn&#8217;t imagine any one of that squad grabbing the team by the scruff of the neck at half time. Maybe Jens Lehmann but he&#8217;s hardly in a position to be bossing anyone around just yet being at the club about three days.</p>
<p>It told and we didn&#8217;t exactly come out in the second half raring to go. The only boost of confidence was Denilson&#8217;s departure for Chamakh, which meant Nasri dropped back into midfield. I thought Marouane had a good half actually; he&#8217;s been a bit disappointing since RVP returned and took his place in the side but he was one of my men of the match yesterday. He was getting involved, looking for the ball and making moves, which unfortunately cannot be said of a lot of players. I have no problem with a lack of quality or skill but I love a player that puts the effort in and that&#8217;s exactly what Chamakh did yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised. He could still do with a goal though, he got an assist for Arshavin&#8217;s goal but if he could rediscover that goal scoring form from early in the season it could be vital to our title hopes. I wasn&#8217;t so impressed with Andrey Arshavin yesterday, he is miles ahead in the vote for Arsenal.com&#8217;s man of the match but he was pissing me off yesterday. It was just the typical Arshavin performance &#8211; do nothing all game, amble around and then two bits of magic and he&#8217;s a hero. He never got going until we were 2-0 down and that was true of most of the side. Why the fuck do we have to wait until we&#8217;re losing by two goals to actually have a go? It&#8217;s like we had no motivation, is the Premier League title not motivating enough? For fucks sake&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, Ramsey was taken off for Bendtner in the 56th minute as Wenger tried to do something about our game. I thought Aaron had an alright hour, he needs games to get back to his best but he can&#8217;t do a lot when the players around him aren&#8217;t helping and I think that was his problem yesterday. We were 1-0 down but we weren&#8217;t creating or doing much, maybe having Bendnter, Chamakh, van Persie, Arshavin and Nasri on the pitch would force something out of them. However it wasn&#8217;t the substitution that inspired us, it was another West Brom goal.</p>
<p>They went 2-0 up two minutes after that change and what a ridiculous goal it was. The ball was hoofed up field more in hope than anything else, Odemwingie had just Squillaci to beat but Almunia made it a whole lot easier for him by charging out of his goal for no apparently reason, getting nowhere near the ball. The West Brom striker  just had to take a touch and score into the empty net. I&#8217;d almost forgotten about this side of Manuel&#8217;s game, he made some good saves at Old Trafford and the Nou Camp but for every four or five good stops there&#8217;s a moment of madness. I don&#8217;t know what the fuck he was thinking, we were in trouble but Squillaci was there and if he had stayed in goal then Odemwingie would&#8217;ve had some work to do to try and find some room for a shot and Almunia might&#8217;ve saved it then. Instead he ran out of goal with no real confidence and made it easy for him. If you&#8217;re going to come out, you have to 100% commit and sprint to the ball, not just jog out and hope for the best. There was some calling for Lehmann but I don&#8217;t think he is the answer. I mean Jens is a legend but he&#8217;s just as crazy as Almunia and I wouldn&#8217;t put it past him making the same mistake yesterday. Not just that but he&#8217;s been out of football for ages and there&#8217;s a reason for that &#8211; he&#8217;s here simply in case Almunia gets injured so I&#8217;m not saying drop Manuel. He&#8217;s all we have so we can&#8217;t moan too much about yesterday calamitous error, all we can do is just get behind him and hope Szczesny recovers soon.</p>
<p>At 2-0 down it looked pretty dire and to be honest I thought we were going to lose seeing the way we&#8217;d been playing. There were a few Gooners who had seen enough and were making their way out. There was still half an hour to go though so there was still time to turn it around if there was some miracle. I was saying in my head that I&#8217;d be happy with a draw now, at 1-0 down I still thought we might come back and win but at this point I would just be happy with a point. We only needed a goal to inspire us and that came with 20 minutes to go.</p>
<p>We started actually showing some urgency after going two down. I was frustrated it had taken this long but at least we were playing now. Arshavin suddenly decided that he wanted to play and he was instrumental in our fight back. In the 70th minute he played a one-two with Chamakh, took a touch inside the area and finished brilliantly in the far corner with his left foot. That&#8217;s the thing with Arshavin, he can have an awful game then out of nowhere score a brilliant goal! We put the foot on the pedal even more and just seven minutes later we squeezed in the second. Arshavin did well on the left wing getting past two defenders and managing to put in cross. It fell to the back post, Bendtner got a knee on it before it went out and it fell to van Persie who slid in and the ball trickled across the line. It was a scrappy, scrappy goal but one we worked hard for and we&#8217;d got it back to 2-2.</p>
<p>We spent the remainder of the game pushing and we could&#8217;ve got a third but it never came. To come from 2-0 down to win 3-2 would&#8217;ve been brilliant and incredibly motivating for the rest of the season but in the end it didn&#8217;t come and I guess we just have to be thankful we got those two goals. To lose yesterday, well it would&#8217;ve been fucking shit to say the least. The team&#8217;s attitude was not right and I hope that it gets sorted out in the two week break we&#8217;ve got now. We&#8217;re lacking leadership and fight but hopefully that will return when we get some players back after these internationals. Fabregas, Walcott and Song are all due back for our next game, which will be a massive boost; we really miss the different qualities of those three players &#8211; Creation, leadership, pace and the ability to defend. However we always go into international breaks in this sort of situation &#8211; just as it looks like we&#8217;re nearing some degree of a full squad another group of players go and get injured. My money is on van Persie to come back crocked but my fingers are heavily crossed he can escape injuries just this once; we could do with a bit of luck.</p>
<p>Man United have got injury problems of their own and I think this break comes at a good time for them too. The lucky bastards got a last minute gifted goal yesterday to win 1-0 so they&#8217;re five points ahead of us now having played a game more but that game in hand we have is away to Tottenham and that&#8217;s hardly a guaranteed three points.</p>
<p>As frustrating and heartbreaking these sort of times are, it sure is exciting and I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re in the mix. Thanks for reading.
