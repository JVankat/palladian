<span class="article"><i>Compiled by Anoop Kumar </i></span><br>02/09/2006</i></span><br><br><span class="article"><b><i>(This article is sponsored by <a href="http://www.mhkimmigration.com/" target=new>Monique Kornfeld, Esq.</a>)</i></b><br></span> <p><span class="article"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Something indeed seems to be cooking
between Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. Rumous ought to be treated
as rumors. Abhishek Bachchan’s birthday party at his residence Jalsa
has been a rollicking affair.&nbsp; Aish was one of the first to arrive
at the bash was and she was one of the last few to leave. As usual both
parties are quiet and have not made any public comments. </span><br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Now that Rang De Basanti is running
successfully all over, stories related to its making have slowly
started coming out of closet. According to sources Hrithik Roshan was
approached to act in Rakeysh Mehra’s film but he turn down the offer.
Even Aamir Khan personally met Hrithik to persuade him for Rang De
Basanti. But Hrithik being Hrithik stuck to his guns, and refused.
Probably he refused because was not offered the lead role. Hrithik
stopped accepting supporting roles after his brilliant performance in
‘Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham’ went unnoticed.&nbsp; Hrithik is gearing up
for 2006 with Krrish, Dhoom 2 and Akbar Jodha ready for release.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It looks like Bollywood gossipers are
not enough of marriage talk, even after seeing so many celebrity
couples wedded in the past few months. Rumors are rife that Amisha
Patel is planning to take her marriage vows - this March, and no points
for guessing with whom. According to the gossips Amisha has caught up
with a sudden desire to marry her long time lover Vikram Bhatt this
year, March. To add fire to the notion, both are maintaining silence on
the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vikram’s response to media is,&nbsp; “I don’t
know. At this point of time she is chasing her career and I am chasing
her. I am ready whenever she is. This relationship is for keeps.” </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">One more marriage is on its way.
Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan told a magazine that he's thinking about
marrying his Italian girlfriend, but has not yet started considering a
date.&nbsp; Saif separated last year from his wife, Amrita Singh, after
14-years of marriage, and has since started dating Rosa, an Italian
woman.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Former 'good friends' and
mentor-protégé Ram Gopal Varma and Urmila Matondkar are finally doing a
film together again. Taufeeq, who is a Ramu camper, will direct it.
Incidentally, Urmila spent her birthday some days back at the Bryan
Adams concert in Mumbai.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Rituparno Ghosh is a busy man these
days. For his much cherished English Project Draupadi Rituparno has
finalised Bipasha Basu for the character of Draupadi. Says ecstatic
Rituparno, "I wanted my Draupadi to be dark and attractive. Not a sex
symbol, but she had to possess the oomph factor. I could see all these
qualities in Bipasha. "My Draupadi will be more real and it will be my
interpretation from a filmmaker's perspective. The story of Mahabharat
is known to everyone, but I have a specific vision in my mind which I
wanted to convey through my film.” Bipasha, however, refuses to give
out any details about her upcoming project till the deal is officially
signed</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Yesteryear actress Nadira died after
prolonged illness at a city hospital on Thursday morning. She was 74.
Nadira was admitted to hospital on December 31 after she suffered a
paralytic stroke coupled with a heart attack. Doctors said she was also
suffering from other complications and had been in coma. Born in Israel
as Florence Ezekiel, Nadira, a spinster, had been staying all alone in
a flat in South Mumbai for several years. Starting her career in 1952
with Aan, Nadira acted in several popular films, including Shree 420,
Pakeezah and Julie, painting various shades of grey - be it a confident
woman or a sensuous seductress.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
