					<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><b>Helping 
					Practitioners &amp; Industry Help those with Endometriosis</b>*<br>
					<br>
					Endometriosis is a painful reproductive and immunological 
					disease afflicting nearly 176 million women and girls 
					worldwide (twice the number of Alzheimer's patients and 
					seven times those with Parkinson's).&nbsp; The illness is a 
					leading cause of female infertility, chronic pelvic pain and 
					gynecologic surgery, and accounts for nearly half of the 
					600,000 hysterectomies performed in the United States 
					annually.&nbsp; It is more prevalent than breast cancer, yet 
					continues to be treated as an insignificant, obscure 
					ailment.&nbsp; Recent studies have even shown an elevated risk of 
					certain cancers in women with Endometriosis. The average 
					delay in diagnosis is a startling 9 years, and a woman will 
					go through as many as 5 physicians before she is properly 
					diagnosed and treated.<br>
					<br>
					Even in this age of medical advances, Endometriosis remains 
					a conundrum to patients and practitioners alike.&nbsp; The 
					disease can only be diagnosed definitively through invasive 
					surgery, and while there are several theories, researchers 
					remain unsure as to the definitive cause of Endometriosis.&nbsp; 
					The disease knows no racial or socio-economic barriers, and 
					can affect women ranging from adolescence to 
					post-menopause.&nbsp; Once touted as mythical treatments, we know 
					that &quot;pregnancy&quot;, �menopause� and &quot;hysterectomy&quot; are far 
					from curative, nor is the gamut of medical suppressives 
					often suggested to patients.&nbsp; Gold standard surgery, wherein 
					all disease is truly removed from all locations, is 
					difficult to obtain and often, patients are subjected to 
					lesser, superficial surgical removal with a very high 
					recurrence rate.&nbsp; The disease can be so painful as to render 
					a woman or teen unable to care for herself or her family or 
					attend work, school or social functions.&nbsp; Endometriosis 
					affects every aspect of a woman's life, from her self-esteem 
					to her relationships to her ability to be a contributing 
					member of society. </span></font></p>
