</span><span class="style2"><strong><em>Jayhawk Conference well represented at 
volleyball national championships<br>
</em></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><br>
Proving to be one of the toughest volleyball conferences in the country, the 
Jayhawk Conference recently had three teams place in the top-10 of their 
respective national tournaments.<br>
<br>
Both Cowley College (national runner-up) and Johnson County (sixth place) had 
stellar showings at the NJCAA Division II National Championships held in 
Wisconsin Dells, WI Nov. 19-21. While, Hutchinson placed ninth at the NJCAA 
Division I National Championships held in Council Bluffs, IA.<br>
<br>
Jayhawk Conference Commissioner Bryce Roderick enjoyed watching these three 
schools blossom towards the end of the season.<br>
<br>
�It was exciting to have three teams representing the conference and region so 
well at the national tournament,� Roderick said. �It was really reflective as to 
how good volleyball is in the Jayhawk Conference and was a great way to cap the 
season.�<br>
Roderick praised the coaching jobs done by Jenifer Bahner (Cowley), Jenny Ei 
(Johnson County), and Ronda Shirley (Hutchinson).<br>
<br>
For the Tigers, this marked the second time in the past five years that the team 
has finished as the national runner-up. The last time coming in 2005 when they 
lost the national championship to Johnson County.<br>
<br>
After winning its first three matches at the national tournament against Monroe 
College (N.Y.) 25-18, 25-17, 25-16, Des Moines (IA) Area Community College 
(25-19, 21-25, 25-21, 25-17), and Parkland College (20-25, 25-20, 25-22, 19-25, 
15-13) to advance to the title match against Illinois Central College, Cowley 
fell behind two games to none to the Lady Cougars.<br>
<br>
Indicative of its season, Cowley would not go down without a fight. The Lady 
Tigers rallied to win the next two games (25-23, 25-22) to force a fifth and 
final set.<br>
<br>
Having to expend so much energy to fight back in the match seemed to catch up to 
the Lady Tigers in the final game as the Lady Cougars won by a score of 15-7 to 
claim the national title.<br>
<br>
�Going five games and being so close makes it tough, but we need to look at all 
the great things we did,� Bahner said. �I am very proud of them to fight back 
and get to a fifth game.�<br>
<br>
The second place finish matches the program�s highest ever finish at the 
national tournament. Cowley ends the season with a record of 32-5 and had the 
highest winning percentage (86.5%) in the program�s history.<br>
Bahner had a season to remember as she helped guide Cowley to conference and 
region titles, a 19-match win streak, and a runner-up national finish.<br>
<br>
Johnson County, which finished in a tie for second place behind Cowley in the 
Jayhawk Conference Eastern Division, rallied to defeat Iowa Lakes in five games 
(22-25, 22-25, 25-19, 25-15, 15-9) before losing its second round match against 
Kishwaukee (IL) College (23-25, 23-25, 19-25).<br>
<br>
The Lady Cavaliers would then defeat Kalamazoo (MI) Valley Community College in 
three games (25-17, 25-19, 25-20) to advance to the fifth/sixth place match, 
which they dropped to Des Moines (IA) Area Community College (17-25, 19-25, 
22-25).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Still, it was another stellar season for the Lady Cavaliers as they finished 
with a record of 27-9. Ei, who has accumulated a record of 57-13 in her two 
seasons as head coach at Johnson County, believes the conference was much 
tougher from top to bottom.<br>
<br>
�We had a stronger conference this year than in years past,� Ei said. �Our 
conference is one that is very competitive. We were well represented at the 
national tournament and Cowley did an excellent job.�<br>
<br>
Both Cowley and Johnson County had only three returning players on its roster, 
meaning next year�s teams should once again be in the hunt for a national 
championship.<br>
<br>
�We are really looking forward to next year,� Ei said. �Our freshmen did a nice 
job of progressing and gained the experience they needed.�<br>
<br>
At the NJCAA Division I National Championships, Hutchinson put an opening round 
loss (21-25, 17-25, 18-25) to Hillsborough Community College behind them as they 
came back to win three matches in a row, including the ninth place match against 
San Jacinto College by a score of 25-23, 24-26, 25-19, 26-24.<br>
<br>
Hutchinson also defeated Spartanburg Methodist College (25-15, 25-8, 25-10), and 
Panola College (25-19, 25-20, 17-25, 25-21) en route to its ninth place finish. 
The Lady Blue Dragons, which placed second in the Jayhawk West, finished the 
season with a record of 33-9.<br>
<br>
Hutchinson head coach Ronda Shirley, the school�s all-time leader in coaching 
victories, was proud of her team for fighting back from the opening round loss.<br>
<br>
�Unfortunately, we lost at the wrong time,� Shirley said. �We could have checked 
it in, but I instilled in them to take pride in representing us and the region.�<br>
<br>
With Hutchinson finishing one game behind Seward County in the Jayhawk West, and 
Pratt (8-4) and Barton County (7-5) posting winning records in the conference, 
Shirley was impressed with the level of competition her team faced during the 
season.<br>
<br>
�I think the conference was more level than I have seen it in the 12 years I 
have been here,� Shirley said. �Any four of us (Hutchinson, Seward, Pratt, and 
Barton County) could have gone to the national tournament.�<br>
<br>
Like Cowley and Johnson County, Hutchinson will also return a strong team next 
season. Don�t be surprised to see the Lady Blue Dragons making another run at 
conference and regional titles, as well as a national championship.<br>
Bahner summed it up best when talking about her team.<br>
�It has been a great journey for all of us.�</span></p>
