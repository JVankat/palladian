<A NAME="session0"><H2>History for the Uninitiated: mostly in CV</H2></A>

So, after the ship sank, the characters more or less went their separate
ways, each finding their own way of dealing with the horror of the last
month and the last hours of the ship.  A month and more passed while powers
went into abeyance, lives resumed their natural courses, people found their
way back to their comfortable niches.  Well...not everyone, actually.
Sabrina, bitter, isolated, lonely, was seduced by a clique of voracious
Unseelie Fey (Redcaps) which were slowly feeding on all the things that made
Sabrina <I>Sabrina</I>.  After several painful encounters with Sabrina after she'd
been running with them for <I>several weeks</I>, the group decided to look into
matters a little more carefully.  Thanks to some masterful research from
Vivian, the Scoobies realized that the high rollers Sabrina had fallen in
with were in actuality monsters of the most depraved, violent, and
rapacious sort.  After some planning and a frightening encounter in a
junkyard, the Scoobies resolved to make contact with Sabrina and rescue
her.  Vivian ambushed Sabrina in the women's room of The Boom Boom Room one
night, while Keyes (the leader of the fey) was holding court, and
confronted Sabrina with the realities of her situation.  The encounter was
painful, but Sabrina was won over -- with a slight snag: she refused to
leave, instead telling Vivian that she was going to go back and help to
make amends.  After several surreptitious notes were passed a la Alias, the
Scoobies made their move and attacked the base of the redcaps, killing
several and rescuing Sabrina.  Unfortunately, the leader, Keyes, and his
two main lieutenants (Johanna and Lisbette) were away during the attack,
inadvertantly escaping with their lives.

The very nexy day, Alex, having gone to visit relatives (primarily
Josefina's) and to celebrate Carnival in Buenos Aires with Josefina
returned to Happy Valley.  He was roped into helping Vivian out, moving a
shipment of old books from an estate sale into the Scrying Pool along with
most of the rest of the Scoobies (Hamilton long since having moved north to
Seattle or something to persue his dreams).  While moving the books,
Starchilde set off a magical trap that sucked in all the Imbued, forcing
them to live out his perveted hentai fantasies.  They escaped that mostly
unharmed (except Starchilde -- Nate broke his arm to, uhm, end the trance),
and Alex briefly escaped back to Southern California after an eventful
dinner with Vivian and Althea.

Unfortunately, he was called back two days later by his father for a
special retirement dinner on Friday of that week (two days later) -- an
ideal opportunity to network and make contacts, etc.  Josefina wasn't best
pleased to have Alex leave so precipitously, but in this matter, Alex
wasn't to be swayed.  He arrived back in HV and went to the dinner/cocktail
party, coincidentally meeting up with Sabrina under semi-suspicious
circumstances.  They talked briefly, then Sabrina, halfway through their
conversation, freaked out and without warning thrust her hand into Alex's
left pants pocket.  Alex was startled by this, but perhaps even moreso when
he was stung by something INSIDE his pocket.  Both he and Sabrina fled
Nikolai's after Alex stomped the shit out of a small glassy spider and a
red silk ribbon calling card (which they later determined was probably
planted at the retirement party by Johanna -- Nikolai's was one of Keyes'
preferred hangouts).  While outside, Alex looked over Sabrina's two bites
(the glassy spider had stung Sabrina twice before it stung Alex through his
trousers), but his examination was interrupted when a red-glowing-eyed rat
suddenly scuttled across the boardwalk and bit his sister.  Nate ended up
saving the day (he had been trying to track Sabrina after she tearfully
walked out of the Scrying Pool several hours earlier), but both were aided
by the Demon-rat's singleminded focus on biting <I>Sabrina</I>, almost ignoring 
Alex and Nate at the possible cost of its life.

They moved on up the boardwalk, intending to get to a hospital, but were
subsequently attacked by a vampire which practically ignored Nate in lieu
of attacking Sabrina.  It was hastily staked, and with an enhanced sense of
urgency, they continued on, having a possible narrow escape with something
else that was perhaps <I>very</I> dangerous.  After an abortive visit to the 
hospital, Nate, Alex (with two tiny bites on his thigh), and Sabrina (with
two nasty swelling bites on her hand) moved to the warehouse where the
Scoobies gathered, formed a plan and rested for the night.  Later the next
day, Vivian hit the library to do research while Sabrina appeared mostly
normal though perhaps a little tired (having had a nasty bloody nose while
she slept).  While there, Vivian found that the little scorpion that stung
Sabrina was called a brid (breed) -- a nasty magically augmented spider
with potent poison that kills men within 20-40 minutes in gruesome,
agonizing fashion, and similarly kills women -- only in 24-48 hours.  In
addition, the brid's bite makes the victim especially <I>attractive</I> for
all sorts of supernatural beasties, the attractive qualities expanding as
death becomes imminent.  While at the library, the Scoobies were attacked
by some especially large critters from Nate's prelude and were forced to
run like hell -- but not before Vivian began piecing together a ritual to
reverse the effects of the brid's bite.  Alex and Sabrina were dispatched
to buy some of the fixins, while Nate and Vivian went the other way to
collect some of Vivian's things.  As everyone reconverged at the warehouse
(about 18 hours after Sabrina was bitten -- and subsequently absorbed all
the poison in the first two bites), it was clear that Sabrina's condition
was deteriorating....

laughingdog0: someone gimme a refresher

laughingdog0: where were we?

junioragentace: We were searching for components for the spell to cure
	    Sabrina. 

laughingdog0: IIRC, it was around 5pm, and everyone was gathered at the
	    warehouse? 
	   
junioragentace: We had gotten the silver mortar & pestle from Ethan's...

laughingdog0 (9:50:23 PM): right -- alex and sabrina had just returned with
	    the .... right.

rob_meyers (9:50:28 PM): yeah

junioragentace (9:50:37 PM): ...and were going to Spivey Shaft to get cave
	    moss, hence the spelunking. 

laughingdog0 (9:51:10 PM): I envy your notes, doug.

junioragentace (9:51:32 PM): Viv's attire: Doc Martens, black jeans,
	    Bauhaus t-shirt (faded), leather jacket (hip-length). 

rob_meyers (9:51:35 PM): My notes ended with "Vivian gets involved. Lots of
	    stuff happens" 

laughingdog0 (9:51:40 PM): (can everyone read my text okay? I can switch
	    colors if it's too hard to read)	 

junioragentace (9:51:58 PM): Maybe a wee bit darker would be cool.

laughingdog0 (9:52:40 PM): okay, this better?

rob_meyers (9:52:47 PM): yeah

junioragentace (9:52:50 PM): Always bet on black.

laughingdog0 (9:52:53 PM): heh

laughingdog0 (9:52:58 PM): thanks, mr purple.

pupillusperpetua (9:53:20 PM): Okay, good to go.

junioragentace (9:53:25 PM): Purple seems adequately Viviantastic.

laughingdog0 (9:53:43 PM): don't make me smack you.

laughingdog0 (9:53:55 PM): okay

pupillusperpetua (9:54:11 PM): Heh.

pupillusperpetua (9:54:25 PM): Same for me. If mine becomes illegible, just
	    say something. 

laughingdog0 (9:54:46 PM): so, we were at the warehouse, everyone was
	    there, it was around 5/530, alex and sabrina had just returned
	    with the silver mortar and pestle.

rob_meyers (9:54:59 PM): yeah

laughingdog0 (9:55:03 PM): what were V and N doing while they were away?

rob_meyers (9:55:11 PM): Nate had taken Vivian to her place so she could
	    change and grab some books. 

laughingdog0 (9:57:00 PM): anyone have any notes about what the weather was
	    like? 

laughingdog0 (9:57:09 PM): if not, I'm just going to make it up.

rob_meyers (9:57:11 PM): clear and cold, I think

laughingdog0 (9:57:14 PM): okay.

laughingdog0 (9:57:18 PM): let's stick with that.

junioragentace (9:57:30 PM): Yeah, clear and cold; blustery.

laughingdog0 (9:58:23 PM): the interior of the warehouse remains
	    sufficiently comfortable, despite the occasional breezes that
	    whisle down through the gaps where the trees are growing up
	    through the roof.

laughingdog0 (9:58:53 PM): that's probably the loudest noise aside from the
	    quiet rustlings of the various flora in the garden itself. 

junioragentace (9:59:20 PM): Vivian is upstairs, smoking and going over her
	    notes until everyone's ready to go.  

laughingdog0 (9:59:24 PM): it's quickly become dark, aside from a small
	    coleman latern that walter's set up over the small glass and
	    steel patio table.

rob_meyers (9:59:42 PM): Nate's got his running shoes, jeans, t-shirt, and
	    sweat jacket 

rob_meyers (9:59:46 PM): normal attire for him

pupillusperpetua (10:00:05 PM): Alex is wearing designer casual, I
	    think. His usual. 

rob_meyers (10:01:17 PM): "Are we going to the cave tonight then?"

pupillusperpetua (10:02:31 PM): (Hmmm. Need to get used to not having an
	    emote command.) 

rob_meyers (10:02:59 PM): [ put OOC stuff in brackets, makes it easy to
	    separate out things which aren't "said" ] 

pupillusperpetua (10:03:16 PM): "Well, yeah... we don't really have enough
	    time left not to." 

rob_meyers (10:03:25 PM): [ Nate paces the room, agitated ]

rob_meyers (10:03:51 PM): "I have flashlights in the car. Walter, do you
	    know where we can find a cave that has what we'll need?" 

laughingdog0 (10:04:47 PM): **walter nods thoughtfully, "Yeah. I know where
	    Spivey Shaft is." 

rob_meyers (10:05:07 PM): [ Nate looks at Sabrina, does she have a jacket
	    on? ] 

laughingdog0 (10:05:10 PM): **walter frowns, "Though I don't know if it's
	    still open. We may need a sledge and some bolt cutters." 

rob_meyers (10:05:30 PM): "I can probably 'borrow' some tools from the
	    junkyard." 

junioragentace (10:06:06 PM): Vivian, abruptly to Walter: "Do you know
	    where we can find a spring?" 

pupillusperpetua (10:06:16 PM): [Is there a wall or other surface Alex
	    could lean against?] 

junioragentace (10:06:22 PM): "Not a slinky; I mean, a water-spring."

laughingdog0 (10:06:27 PM): **sabrina is just sitting at the table, head
	    cradled in her arms 

laughingdog0 (10:06:48 PM): [yes, there's a wall just behing the table --
	    I'll get a diagram up this week of the garden and warehouse] 

pupillusperpetua (10:07:24 PM): [Alex is leaning back against the wall,
	    arms folded over his chest. He's watching Sabrina quietly with
	    little expression on his face beyond a slightly furrowed brow.]

laughingdog0 (10:07:25 PM): **walter glances over at vivian appraisingly,
	    studying her briefly, "I know several. What do you need?"

laughingdog0 (10:07:57 PM): [sabrina breathes shallowly, not quite
	    hyperventilating] 

junioragentace (10:08:22 PM): "Somewhere close. Big enough for a person to
	    stand in." She glances briefly at Sabrina, then back at
	    Walter. "Somewhere kinda private would be good."

laughingdog0 (10:08:49 PM): [outside, a gust of wind rattles the
	    flora. walter glances up at the ceiling breifly, then looks
	    back down.]

rob_meyers (10:08:55 PM): "Do we need the moss first? Or will this help her
	    now?" 

junioragentace (10:09:13 PM): "No... the spring comes last. But it's
	    important." 

rob_meyers (10:09:28 PM): "Ok, so let's go get the moss."

junioragentace (10:09:41 PM): To Sabrina: "How're you holding up, sweetie?" 

rob_meyers (10:09:50 PM): "We can hit the junkyard quick for bolt cutters
	    and a sledge." 

laughingdog0 (10:09:51 PM): **walter sighs, then nods slowly, his arms
	    folded, "Yeah, I know a couple. There's one down by the beach,
	    maybe half a mile from here."

pupillusperpetua (10:10:04 PM): [What were the ingredients/circumstances
	    for the cure again?] 

rob_meyers (10:10:12 PM): "Then jam up to that mine to get the moss"

laughingdog0 (10:10:22 PM): *Sabrina shrugs slightly, head still down,
	    "Hurts to breathe. I've felt worse." 

junioragentace (10:10:39 PM): [You know it requires cave moss, verbena
	    root, a silver mortar & pestle. That's all Vivian's told you
	    about so far.]

junioragentace (10:11:00 PM): To Nate: "Yeah. Let's get moving."

pupillusperpetua (10:11:12 PM): "What's this about a pool, V? That's not
	    one of the ingredients." *frowning* 

rob_meyers (10:11:29 PM): Nate grabs his keys and walks quickly to the door

rob_meyers (10:11:53 PM): "Huh? Either way we still need that moss. We can
	    talk in the van" 

junioragentace (10:12:13 PM): To Alex: "I'll tell you in the van. And don't
	    call me 'V.'" 

pupillusperpetua (10:12:28 PM): [Alex shrugs.] 

rob_meyers (10:12:46 PM): Nate is already in the van, getting the engine
	    and interior warmed up 

junioragentace (10:12:50 PM): "If you simply must be monosyllabic, 'Viv' is
	    okay. But not 'V.'" 

pupillusperpetua (10:13:35 PM): "Whatever you say, V." [He shoots her a
	    tight little grin, then pushes off the wall. Taking a step
	    forward, he pats Sabrina's shoulder] "Ready to go, hermanita?"

junioragentace (10:13:54 PM): Vivian huffs and follows Nate out and into
	    the van. 

rob_meyers (10:14:23 PM): "I have my mag flashlight, a smaller one, and a
	    few road flares. We should be ok if it gets dark." 

laughingdog0 (10:14:34 PM): **sabrina looks up, smiles, pleased, then
	    forces herself to stand, betraying only a slight grimace, "Si,
	    alejo. soy listo."

pupillusperpetua (10:15:47 PM): [Alex nods and offers her his arm.] "Lean
	    on me if you need to..." 

laughingdog0 (10:16:14 PM): **Sabrina turns and walks toward the van,
	    glances up at alex, "I will." 

pupillusperpetua (10:16:54 PM): [Alex follows her out. Walks up to Nate's
	    driverside window.] "Hey, man, do you think we should take both
	    cars? Just in case, I mean?"

rob_meyers (10:17:22 PM): "Up to you. I've got a full tank, and we'll all
            easily fit in here." 

junioragentace (10:17:33 PM): "Let's take one. That way I only need to
	    explain the ritual to everyone once." 

rob_meyers (10:17:36 PM): "I've got a spare tire if I get a flat, but you
	    can follow if you'd like" 

rob_meyers (10:17:54 PM): "First stop, the junkyard."

junioragentace (10:18:16 PM): "The junkyard? Wow, Nate, you sure know how
	    to treat a girl." 

laughingdog0 (10:18:24 PM): [The wind blows steadily out of the west,
	    making the crashing of the ocean waves sound as if they're just
	    acrross the street, bringing the stinging salt, and a smell of
	    corruption....]

rob_meyers (10:18:31 PM): "Hey, we're just dropping by your place to get
	    some stuff." 

junioragentace (10:19:02 PM): Vivian rolls her eyes at Nate.

pupillusperpetua (10:19:13 PM): [Alex turns to glance at Sabrina, then
	    turns back to Nate.] "Actually... let's all take yours, unless
	    someone has any objections..." [He pauses a moment, adds in a
	    wry voice.] "Any good objections."

rob_meyers (10:19:14 PM): Once everyone is in the van, Nate starts
	    driving. 

laughingdog0 (10:20:07 PM): [walter settles on the floor in the rear of the
	    van, content to stay quiet and out of the way while nate
	    drives]

pupillusperpetua (10:20:35 PM): [How long is the drive to the junkyard?]

laughingdog0 (10:21:01 PM): [15 minutes maybe]
 
junioragentace (10:21:04 PM): Vivian sits in the front passenger's seat,
	    but kneels on the seat and faces the rear of the van to address
	    the group.

rob_meyers (10:22:08 PM): "I'll be in and out, and we'll be on the way to
            the mine." 

pupillusperpetua (10:22:48 PM): "Roger that, cap'n."

junioragentace (10:23:26 PM): "Okay, guys, here's the Cliff's Notes version
	    of the ritual: You use the consecrated mortar and pestle to
	    grind the cave moss and verbena, sprinkling the resulting mess
	    in a small circle of power, then essentially bathing the
	    victim... er, patient while the she has a small quartz pebble
	    under the tongue. But she has to be bathed in a source of pure
	    water; hence, the spring."

laughingdog0 (10:23:31 PM): [as nate starts up the van, and vivian turns to
            address the group, walter watches with a mild sort of
            interest....]

rob_meyers (10:23:47 PM): "Do we have the pebble?"

junioragentace (10:24:16 PM): Vivian's eyes go wide. "Shit! No... it didn't
	    come up until the last bit in the book." 

pupillusperpetua (10:24:40 PM): "Let me guess... water freshly purified at
	    a water reclamation plant doesn't fit "pure" in your reality
	    tunnel, eh?"

laughingdog0 (10:24:41 PM): **Sabrina sighs, leaning back on the seat
	    looking like she's barely conscious, speaks softly, "no. victim
	    is right."

rob_meyers (10:24:54 PM): "I don't think we have any around the junkyard."

rob_meyers (10:25:02 PM): "Any quartz, anyway."

junioragentace (10:26:04 PM): To Sabrina: "My spell, my nomenclature.
	    Patient."

rob_meyers (10:26:07 PM): "hey, did those redcaps turn into quartz?" 

laughingdog0 (10:27:23 PM): **walter shakes his head, "No. It looked like 
	    slate or greywacke." 

pupillusperpetua (10:28:02 PM): [Alex just rolls his eyes. Mutters
	    something about this whole thing turning into a circus.]  

junioragentace (10:28:49 PM): "I might have one at home -- I went through a
	    phase where I was trying to use minerals as empathic receptors
	    -- let me think."

laughingdog0 (10:29:00 PM): **walter looks up at alex, "What exactly does
	    consecrated mean?" 

pupillusperpetua (10:29:36 PM): [I hate to be a big frigging nerd, but
	    could I get everyone to slow down just a little? Maybe write a
	    little more descriptive text? I'm losing way too much detail at
	    the rate we're doing this. We're also missing some potentially
	    important RP.]

laughingdog0 (10:30:04 PM): [yah -- agreed, devo]

pupillusperpetua (10:30:35 PM): [I'm also a slow reader. :-B]

junioragentace (10:30:58 PM): Vivian brightens, making the van seat creak a
	    little as she bounces up and down with excitement. "Yeah! I
	    totally have one back at the flat!"

rob_meyers (10:31:22 PM): "Great! We'll go back there after we get the
 	    moss." 

rob_meyers (10:31:43 PM): [ Nate is talking loudly into the windshield,
	    since he's still driving ] 

pupillusperpetua (10:31:51 PM): [Alex rolls his eyes, says just loud enough
	    for Sabrina to hear] "I said 'circus', right?" 

laughingdog0 (10:32:08 PM): [sabrina smiles weakly, her eyes still closed] 

rob_meyers (10:32:57 PM): "Vivian, are there any more details we might need
	    to know about this ritual?" 

pupillusperpetua (10:33:06 PM): [By the way, Alex is sitting next to
	    Sabrina, if possible, keeping an intermittently close eye on
	    her.]

pupillusperpetua (10:33:49 PM): "Yeah, seriously... it'd be greeeeeat if we
    	    didn't have to make a few big circles or figure eights around
    	    town because we keep... 'forgetting' important bits of
    	    information." [The sarcasm more or less drips.]

laughingdog0: **sabrina speaks to alex, softly, "&lt;Spanish&gt;"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex responds, also in Spanish]

rob_meyers: "Look, we still have time to get this done, and to do it right.
	    We're all kinda rushed here"

rob_meyers: "Keep your head on straight"

laughingdog0: **Sabrina shrugs noncomittally in response to a question from
	    alex, still sitting with her head back, eyes closed, breathing
	    rabidly and shallowly.

rob_meyers: "Besides, staying in motion has been better for us the last
	    couple of days"

junioragentage: Vivian glares daggers at Alex, then slowly forces herself
	    to appear calm.  "That's it.  There's nothing else, I'm sure."
	    Then, offhandedly: "By the way, Walter, 'consecrated' means
	    something declared or made sacred or magical, as through a
	    ritual."

pupillusperpetua: "Um, yeah... Sabrina jumped up on the scale just by
            walking out of the warehouse.  She only went back when the car
            started moving."

pupillusperpetua: [Alex grins a mixture of belligerence and anxiety at
            Vivian in response.] 

rob_meyers: "See."

laughingdog0: **walter pauses, frowns, "Are you sure?  Isn't holy water
	    also 'consecrated'?"

rob_meyers: "Holy water is sacred, right?"

pupillusperpetua: [What's the date again?]

junioragentage: "Yep!  Exactly!  The blessing from the priest is the ritual
	    which makes it sacred -- consecrated!"

junioragentage: [evening, 3/15/03]

pupillusperpetua: [Thanks.]

laughingdog0: *walter glances at sabrina, watches alex for a second, then
	    stares forward at vivian doubtfully.

rob_meyers: "Walter, I only have the two flashlights, and one of those is
	    dinky.  I have a couple of flares though"

pupillusperpetua: "Hey, Nate?  You got any painkiller in this tank?
	    Vivian?  Any of yous?"	 

junioragentage: "I have a light source..."  Vivian gives the group a
	    proud/mischievous grin.

laughingdog0: **walter nods, "Okay.  Maybe we can hit the A&P on the way
	    over."

rob_meyers: "Vivian, do you still have those pills from the warehouse?"

junioragentage: To Nate.  "Maybe..."  To Alex: "What's it worth to ya?"

laughingdog0: [a gust of wind shakes the van as N makes a left turn]

pupillusperpetua: [Alex stares at her flatly for a moment.]  "It's not for
	    me." 

junioragentage: Vivian yelps as the wind shakes the van on the turn, then
	    looks back at Alex, looking slightly rattled.  "Oh.  Then,
	    yeah.  What do you need?"

junioragentage: "I have all kinds."

pupillusperpetua: "Painkiller.  Nothing too... er... strong, I guess."

rob_meyers: "Lot of wind tonight.  Glad I'm not sleeping outdoors"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex frowns at Nate's comment.]  "You sleep outside a
            lot lately?"

laughingdog0: **walter looks forward at nate, smiles slightly, "Yeah.  It
	    makes camping very unfun."

rob_meyers: "Not lately."

junioragentage: Vivian climbs slowly over her seat and into the back area
            of the van.  She fishes around in her purse for a while, then
            comes up with two small, oblong, yellow pills, and nudges Alex,
            handing them to him.

pupillusperpetua: "Good."

rob_meyers: "I have that apartment now.  And my neighbors aren't trying to
	    make their own crack."

pupillusperpetua: [Alex takes the pills, eyes them for a second, then nods
	    at Vivian.]  "Thanks..."  [He turns to Sabrina, holds them
	    towards her, and says very quietly in Spanish...]

rob_meyers: "Everyone warm enough back there?"

junioragentage: "Brr, no.  I'm coming back up front."  Vivian climbs slowly
	    back into the front seat.  (She has yet to put on her seat belt
	    during the drive.)

rob_meyers: "Didn't you bring a jacket?  We're going into an old mine!"

rob_meyers: Nate turns up the heat in the van

junioragentage: [Vivian is very visibly wearing a hip-length leather
	    jacket.]

laughingdog0: **sabrina opens her eyes, glancing down at the pills in
	    alex's palm, then looks back up into his eyes, looking
	    defensive, "&lt;Spanish&gt;"

pupillusperpetua: "I'm all right.  Don't know if I will be in the mine,
	    though.  Shoulda brought my team parka..." 

pupillusperpetua: [Alex gives Sabrina a very clearly surprised look for a
	    second, then looks out the window before responding to her.]

laughingdog0: **walter: "mine's prolly about 58 degrees or so, once you get
            out of the wind."

rob_meyers: "If we're lucky we won't have to go very deep into the mine.
	    How much moss do we need anyway?"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex moves forward to prod Vivian lightly on the upper
            arm.]

junioragentage: Vivian yanks her arm back like she was bit by a mosquito.
	    "What?"

rob_meyers: Nate looks over, "Calm down! Damn, woman, we're trying to save
	    a friend's life here!"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex grins at Nate, then asks Vivian innocently] "So,
	    uh... what are these, anyways?  [Shows the pills, still in his
	    palm.]

rob_meyers: "I found them in the warehouse."

rob_meyers: "Figured we could sell them or something."

junioragentage: To Nate, angrily:  "I know that!"  Then, more quietly:
	    "Kind of a lot; at least two big handfuls." 

junioragentage: "Of moss, that is."

junioragentage: To Sabrina (looking past/through Alex): "They're Norcos.
	    More of an 'oomph' than Vicodin, but less than, say, Darvon."

rob_meyers: "Do we need to keep it in the silver thing there until we get
	    the rest of the items?" 

laughingdog0: **sabrina nods, wincing visibly, then settles back.

pupillusperpetua: [Glancing back and forth between them, Alex frowns, then
	    crawls back to sit next to Sabrina.] 

junioragentage: To Nate:  "Dunno.  Might as well; couldn't hurt."

rob_meyers: "It all gets ground together, right?"

junioragentage: "Yeah."

laughingdog0: **sabrina listens to alex speaking in spanish, then shakes
	    her head, responds quietly in spanish, then repeats herself to
	    be heard over the noise of the wind as the van begins winding
	    up into the hills.

rob_meyers: "Just down this road a bit further"

junioragentage: "Wow, Nate, I've never been to where you work.  I wonder if
	    it'll be as glamorous as I've always imagined it to be." 

rob_meyers: "It's just like a movie set, but with less trash"

junioragentage: Vivian chuckles.  "Don't tell Althea."

pupillusperpetua: [Alex furrows his brow to Sabrina's comments, responds in
	    Spanish.] 

laughingdog0: [up ahead, nate can see the sign pointing toward Hyde
	    Geothermal -- tall conifers on either side of the road
	    gradually replacing houses as the van approaches the auto/junk
	    yard]

rob_meyers: Nate speeds up a bit; not much traffic on this road I'd imagine

laughingdog0: [no, it's empty -- even at the relatively early hour]

pupillusperpetua: [Alex shrugs uncomfortably after trailing off in
            Spanish.] 

rob_meyers: "I know where the tools are.  It won't take me long to get
	    them." 

junioragentage: Vivian rolls down her window a crack.  "Is it okay if I sit
            in the van and smoke as long as I keep the window cracked?" 

laughingdog0: **sabrina responds in spanish, then abruptly switches to
	    english, in clear imitation of some gruff, plain spoken person,
	    "If you're going to do something, do it right girl."

laughingdog0: [sorry -- off by a couple of lines]

rob_meyers: Nate looks over, "Just stand outside the door.  I don't like
	    the smell in my van." 

laughingdog0: *walter speaks, his voice carrying easily over the road
	    noise, "You want to leave the engine running?  you want me or
	    alex to go with you?"

rob_meyers: I'll leave the engine running; I think it'll just take me a
	    couple of minutes 

pupillusperpetua: [Alex arches his eyebrows at Sabrina, then grins wryly,
	    crookedly,] "Yeah... the hard part's just deciding what to do."
	    [He pauses, then squeezes her shoulder gently, smiling
	    genuinely] "You made a good choice...  I'm proud of you."

pupillusperpetua: "That old bastard wasn't always wrong."

rob_meyers: "One of you can come with me if you want, but the tool area is
	    small. It'd be too crowded if we all went." 

rob_meyers: "but yeah, I probably shouldn't go alone"

junioragentage: Vivian pouts, prettily (if self-pityingly), first at Nate,
	    then at Alex and Sabrina.  "Nate, if I have to get out of the
	    van anyways, I might as well go with you."

rob_meyers: "Can you carry a heavy sledge?"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex barks out a short laugh, stifled into a smirking
            grin.  He says nothing articulate.] 

junioragentage: "Sure!"  Vivian makes something which, in some strange
	    alternate universe, might be a muscle. 

laughingdog0: **walter: "Go nate.  Hurry.  We'll wait,"

rob_meyers: Nate grins at her.  "Ok, we'll be right back"

rob_meyers: [ Nate unlocks the gate, opens it enough for himself and
	    Vivian, and jogs quickly to the tool shed ] 

junioragentage: Vivian follows Nate, pulling a cigarette free from her
	    silver case even as she hops out of the passenger seat. 

pupillusperpetua: [In a soft undertone...]  "Shit..."  [Alex climbs out of
            the van and begins pacing around it, staring out into the
            deepening evening at regular intervals, pacing...]

junioragentage: Vivian, who had been lagging behind Nate while lighting her
            cigarette, suddenly sprints to catch up to him.  She grabs his
            shoulder, squeezing hard, and says, "Nate!  Nate!"  (urgently
            but quietly)

rob_meyers: Nate stops and turns around

rob_meyers: In a low voice, "What? Something wrong?"

laughingdog0: **walter moves forward in the van, kneels next to sabrina,
	    watching her, looking concerned. 

junioragentage: "I'm hearing those little squeaky sounds again... like at
	    the library..." 

rob_meyers: "Fuck.  Let's hurry.  Stay close to me."

laughingdog0: [nate and vivian are standing in a little pool of shadow just
            beyond the gate, heading toward the toolshed, wending their way
            around parked junked cars.  as she finishes, the two of them,
            turn and move more quickly into the darkness]

junioragentage: Vivian reaches into her purse and pulls out a plastic water
            bottle.  She shakes it briskly; when she does so, it bursts
            forth with light, equal to a medium-bright fluorescent bulb.

rob_meyers: "Thanks"

laughingdog0: **walter looks at alex, his eyes glittering in the darkness a
	    bit, an odd little smile on his face, "You got a weapon handy,
	    alejo?"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex pretty much spends the rest of the time pacing,
	    listening, looking... until either something threatens his
	    perception range or the others return...]

junioragentage: Her eyes are wide.  Looking scared, she says, "We're not
	    the ones in danger!  They always go after Sabrina, remember?
	    It's the people in the van who are in trouble!"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex pauses, looks at Walter] "Just a pair of flares I
            brought in to the library earlier... 'In case of vampire' and
            all that..."

rob_meyers: [ is the van still in sight for us? ]

laughingdog0: [with vivian's light, and with the headlights on, you can see
	    its outline, and alex standing, pacing -- maybe 50m away.
	    tops.]

junioragentage: Vivian calls Alex on his cell phone.

laughingdog0: [nate and vivian approach the toolshed, vivian's light
	    catching the green scaborous boards while nate briefly fumbles
	    with the lock...]

rob_meyers: "He's just over there.  You could shout at him"

junioragentage: Vivian glowers, more nervously than angrily, at Nate, and
	    waits for Alex to pick up. 

pupillusperpetua: [Alex pauses suddenly, stiffening, then relaxes slightly.
	    He pokes his head in the van.]  "Well... color me
	    unsurprised... they're both safe."  [He then jumps slightly as
	    his cellphone rings and vibrates simultaneously.  He jams his
	    hand in his pocket and pulls the thing out, opens it, and says
	    into it, slightly urgent] "What?  What's wrong?!"

junioragentage: Quietly into the cell phone: "Those things from the
	    library!  I can hear them, rustling around, making noises."
	    Her voice shakes a little.  "Get inside!  Lock the door!"

laughingdog0: **walter stands, moves forward, ready to slam the back door
            shut the second alex jumps inside. 

pupillusperpetua: [Lowering his voice as well] "Shit!  SHIT!  Thanks... but
            I think they can break the glass anyways.  You saw what they
            did to that door!  Fuck, they can probably shred through the
            doors!"

rob_meyers: "Vivian, tell Walter to drive the truck down the road and back" 

laughingdog0: **walter shrugs, "Maybe we can stall them a little bit."

junioragentage: Vivian, to Alex:  "Tell Walter to drive the truck down the
	    road and back!  We'll be okay; they're after Sabrina." 

laughingdog0: **walter nods as he moves to the front seat, "I heard."

pupillusperpetua: "Good idea.  I'll drive.  You guys call when you're
	    done."  [Alex turns and climbs in the van, climbs into the
	    driver seat, and puts the car in gear.]  "We're not safe
	    here..."

laughingdog0: [nate gets the lock open, surveys the tools, a grabs out a
	    pair of heavy bolt cutters, a 12lb sledge, and....?] 

rob_meyers: [ a big crowbar if there's one in sight ]

laughingdog0: [as he does so, he hears the van begin to roar on up the road]

laughingdog0: [sure, there's one on site.  it's mechanic's yard.  why
	    not?]

rob_meyers: Nate hands the crowbar to Vivian, "Here, hold onto this"

rob_meyers: "Let's get back to the road."

junioragentage: Vivian drops her cigarette, crushing it under the heel of
	    her boot.  She puts her arms out.  "Got it.  Anything else?"
	    She's looking around nervously.

rob_meyers: "This should do it.  I don't think a socket set will help us
	    tonight." 

pupillusperpetua: [Ha ha ha!  Nice, Rob!]

junioragentage: [Vivian misses the joke entirely]

rob_meyers: [ Nate leads Vivian back out to the road, locking the shed and
	    the gate behind them ] 

junioragentage: Vivian calls Alex again.

laughingdog0: [nate, even over the wind, you can hear the engine of the van
	    roaring as you approach the road, the wind blasting hard over
	    the landscape]

rob_meyers: "Tell them to open the side door, we can just jump in"

pupillusperpetua: [Alex hands his phone to nate when it rings.  He's
	    concentrating on pushing Nate's van to its limit in terms of
	    speed and handling.]

junioragentage: [er, you mean to Walter?]

laughingdog0: [alex has a really good throwing arm....]

pupillusperpetua: [Yeah.  'swhat I said.  #-o]

laughingdog0: [heh]

junioragentage: [those swim team muscles, yow]

laughingdog0: **walter takes the phone, answers, "yeah"

pupillusperpetua: [Psychometabolism?]

rob_meyers: "Hey, just open the side door when you get here."

junioragentage: Vivian is briefly (only briefly) confused.  "Walter?!"
	    then "Right!  Just have Alex slow down the van, open the side
	    door, and we'll jump in!"

rob_meyers: "Let Alex drive to the mine"

rob_meyers: [ did Alex just run Nate down? ]

laughingdog0: [okay, vivian and nate wait, huddled up against the wind as
	    it howls past the treetops, trying not to shiver as they wait
	    for the sound of the van's engine.  it's not so loud that you
	    have to shout to be heard, but it makes casual conversation
	    difficult]

rob_meyers: "Do you still hear those things around us?"

junioragentage: Vivian has stuffed the light-bottle in one of her pockets,
            so the light is somewhat dimmer.  She's holding the crowbar
            like a too-heavy softball bat.  "No... it's quiet now."

laughingdog0: [after maybe ten minutes, you can hear the throaty roar of
	    the van on its return trip from the south (with hyde to the
	    north)]

laughingdog0: [gm makes a couple of rolls as the van pulls up, alex at the
	    wheel] 

junioragentage: Vivian starts running for the door as soon as it even kinda
            makes sense to do so. 

rob_meyers: [ Nate lets Vivian get in first ]

laughingdog0: [as alex was passing a sign that gave miles to hyde, etc,
	    walter jumped into the back and leaned on the door, waiting
	    until the last moment, presumably, to open it]

pupillusperpetua: [Devon screws with Vivian's head OOCly.]

junioragentage: [What does "OOCly" mean?]

pupillusperpetua: [Out of Character]

pupillusperpetua: [I.e-referring to me, the player]

junioragentage: [SWEIN]

junioragentage: [So What Else Is New?]

laughingdog0: [as the van pulls up along the curb, alex lets the van roll
	    to a slow, as walter slides the side door open and moves back
	    out of the way]

pupillusperpetua: [Heh heh heh heh.]

laughingdog0: [I'm not going to make anyone roll anything -- esp since
	    vivian isn't wearing heels -- though even with painkillers, her
	    foot is aching abominably]

rob_meyers: [ Doh, that's right ]

junioragentage: Vivian is wincing visibly as she runs to catch up to the
            van.  She hands Walter the crowbar, then grabs for his hand so
            he can help her into the van (assuming he looks braced to do
            so).

rob_meyers: Nate would help Vivian get into the van if she was slow at all

laughingdog0: [Walter grabs vivian's hand and easily pulls her into the
	    van.  nate jumps up a second later, presumably turning to close
	    the door behind him]

rob_meyers: yep

rob_meyers: "Alex, do you know how to get to the mine?

pupillusperpetua: [What's my area knowledge diff to know that?]

laughingdog0: [say, 2x]


laughingdog0: **walter glances at vivian, "You okay Vivian?  Is your foot
	    bleeding at all?" 

laughingdog0: **walter turns to nate, "These things when they bite -- we're
	    sure they don't poison?" 

rob_meyers: "No idea"

junioragentage: Vivan, sitting on the floor in the back of the van, has the
	    bottle-light set near her, illuminating the back.  She's
	    unlacing her Doc Marten to take a look.  To Walter: "I'm not
	    sure.  Hurts, though."  Her eyes look a little moist.

rob_meyers: "After we finish the ritual for Sabrina, let's get you to the
	    hospital" 

pupillusperpetua: [Through gritted teeth, Alex grunts out] "Let's get 'em
	    both to the hospital." 

laughingdog0: **walter glances at vivian again, looking a little concerned,
	    then settles next to sabrina, listens to alex and nods. 

rob_meyers: "Walter, you know how to get to the mine, right?  Can we park
	    near it?" 

junioragentage: Vivian pulls off her boot.  Given the bottle light,
	    everyone in the back can see the heel of her sock has partially
	    soaked through with blood.  "Ewww.  Uh, yeah.  It's bleeding."

laughingdog0: **sabrina's eyes open as she sits up, shivering slightly, "I
	    think I'll be okay alex -- if vivian does her spell, I'll be
	    fine."

rob_meyers: "I have a little bit of gauze in my first aid kit back here"

junioragentage: "It's worse than it looks.  I think."  Vivian sets her jaw.
	    "Let's just get to the fucking mineshaft, okay?"  She starts
	    putting her boot back on.

laughingdog0: **walter (to alex): "Go back, take 217 up into the hills.
	    It's about 10 miles out or so.  You can't miss the turn about.
	    We'll have to cut the chain, but the gravel goes right up to
	    it.  Rain hasn't washed it out yet -- not as of 3 months ago or
	    so."

pupillusperpetua: Alex responds by driving a little faster.

laughingdog0: [gm pauses, giving any stragglers a chance....]

laughingdog0: [I go on?]

junioragentage: [I'm good.]

laughingdog0: [bueller?  bueller?]

rob_meyers: Nate buckles up when Alex accelerates.

pupillusperpetua: [Did I not get that Area Knowledge roll?]

rob_meyers: [ I think between you and Walter, we've got it covered ]

laughingdog0: [okay, alex finds a roundabout north of the junkyard, then
	    turns around, leaning the van over on its suspension, then
	    speeds away mindful of the strong gusts that are only slightly
	    dampened by the trees on both sides]

pupillusperpetua: Alexs nods briefly, responds with a terse "Got it."
	    Keeps his eyes firmly glued to the road.

laughingdog0: [sabrina continues to lie back, shivering.  after about 10
	    minutes, she pulls her feet up onto the seat, her forehead
	    wrinkled in concentration, a tiny hint of blood around her
	    nostrils as she continues to breath quickly and shallowly]

rob_meyers: Nate takes off his jacket and puts it on Sabrina like a blanket 

junioragentage: Vivian watches Sabrina for a while, then says, "I hate to
            suggest splitting us up -- it's so fucking Scooby Doo -- but it
            might be smart to have one person drive Sabrina around in the
            van while the rest of us go into the mine."

laughingdog0: [sabrina opens her eyes briefly, and looks at nate, "I'm not
            cold -- not that cold.", then forces herself to sit forward,
            looking more alert]

pupillusperpetua: Alex twitches slightly, "Yeah... yeah... dragging her
	    down a mindshaft seems like a good way to get backed into a
	    small corner."

junioragentage: ["Mindshaft" is good Vivian terminology, but you probably
	    meant "mineshaft"] 

pupillusperpetua: [Er, yeah.]

pupillusperpetua: #-o

laughingdog0: **walter frowns, "How do we do this, then?  One has to drive
	    her around, one has to be able to do something in case things
	    go wrong.  No one's going into a mindshaft alone."

laughingdog0: **walter glances at vivian, "Can you travel on your own power?"

rob_meyers: "Of course not.  Walter, do you know what this moss looks like?"

laughingdog0: **walter shakes his head slowly, "Not offhand."

junioragentage: Pouting slightly:  "I can walk.  I'm okay."

laughingdog0: **walter smiles at vivian, "True.  Can you run like the devil
	    is chasing you?" 

rob_meyers: "But can you run?"

laughingdog0: **walter glances at nate, "First."

pupillusperpetua: "Shit.  No cellphone will get service out of a mindshaft.
	    So either the spidey sense stays with Sabrina, or Sabrina is
	    cut off from the spidey sense... I guess this means I get to
	    play taxi."  He glances over his shoulder real quick, eyes
	    gleaming in passing street light.  "Guess your stuck with (in
	    Spanish, 'big brother') for a while longer, hermanita."

pupillusperpetua: mineshaft, too

pupillusperpetua: [Motherfuckin'...]

junioragentage: Vivian puts her hand to her forehead: "I'm picturing Alex
            in red facepaint and novelty horns, chasing me around in a red
            toga and carrying a plastic pitchfork... Hmm... Yeah, I can
            run, if I have to."

pupillusperpetua: "Don't you mean light blue and gold, V?  I'm gonna be a
            Bruin, after all." 

laughingdog0: **walter studies vivian for a moment, then nods, "Okay."

rob_meyers: "Vivian, you carry the silver bowl.  Walter and I will carry
	    the rest" 

junioragentage: "Light blue and gold?" Vivian says, confused.  Then:
	    "Sure, okay.  I'll get the bowl." 

laughingdog0: **walter shakes his head, "I think two should stay in the van
	    with her.  Alex won't be able to do much if something goes
	    wrong while we're on the road."

rob_meyers: "Guess that means me.  I won't be as useful if something
	    happens near or in the mine" 

pupillusperpetua: "I dunno, man.  You're the ass kicking kung fu master.
            If something is down there..." 

laughingdog0: **walter nods agreement.

rob_meyers: "The road goes right up to it?"

laughingdog0: **walter nods, looking at nate, "It's a big gravel pit sort
	    of.  Like a greek theater almost."

rob_meyers: "Guess I don't have to worry about getting lost in the woods
	    then." 

rob_meyers: "Ok Vivian, it's you and me again.  I'll bring the crowbar just
	    in case." 

laughingdog0: **walter smiles, "No, probably not.  Just stay in the main
	    shaft.  It shouldn't be flooded this time of year." 

rob_meyers: "Hopefully this moss will be near the surface.  Hand me that
	    flashlight. " 

laughingdog0: **walter: "Spivey is pretty straight and isn't steep, but
	    there are alot of side passages, and some of the passages are
	    still supported with wood timber....back from the goldrush
	    days."

junioragentage: Vivian grins at Nate.  "Oh, goody, look who gets to be my
	    boyfriend again."  Then she suddenly starts, staring at Walter.
	    "What do you mean, shouldn't be flooded?"

laughingdog0: **walter smiles grimly, shrugs.

rob_meyers: [ Nate looks around the van ]

rob_meyers: "Walter, how many flares do I have up there?"

laughingdog0: **walter: "One word of advice, if you have to go under to
	    continue, bail.  We can always hit Santa Clarita." 

rob_meyers: "Ok."

rob_meyers: "I was thinking of leaving a flare if we need to take a side
	    passage, so we can find our way back quickly" 

laughingdog0: **walter frowns, shrugs, "Up to you."

pupillusperpetua: [How's everyone doing for time/energy?]

rob_meyers: "The moss might not be in the main shaft.  I only have a few
	    flares; we won't be going too deep" 

pupillusperpetua: [I've got plenty to spare, but I've got the least
            demanding schedule.] 

laughingdog0: **walter glances back at nate, "3 flares back here, nate."

junioragentage: [I'm good for another hour, but not much more]

rob_meyers: [I'm good for another hour also]

laughingdog0: [I'm not likely to be sleepy before 2 or 3]

pupillusperpetua: [Roger.]

laughingdog0: [okay -- we'll call it quits at 1230ish, then?]

rob_meyers: [ok]

junioragentage: [works for me]

laughingdog0: [assuming we don't all have a huge second wind or something]

laughingdog0: [gm pauses so everyone can get caught up]

pupillusperpetua: [Totally caught up.  Alex is just reeeeeally distracted
            at the moment.] 

junioragentage: Vivian is rummaging through her purse, but she essentially
	    looks ready for action, at least by Vivian standards. 

rob_meyers: Nate gathers the flashlight, the 3 flares, and the crowbar.
	    The bolt cutters and sledge are by the side door 

laughingdog0: [okay -- alex continues to drive farther into the hills.
	    it's pitch black, and devoid of anything except the trees
	    crowding up on either side of the road, seething in the wind]

pupillusperpetua: Alex suddenly speaks up in halting tones,
	    "Uhhh... actually, I have an idea.  For when we get there.
	    That is, if, uh... Vivian doesn't mind."

rob_meyers: "Huh?"

junioragentage: Sounding very suspicious:  "If I don't mind? What do you
            mean?" 

pupillusperpetua: Alex glances over his shoulder at Vivian fixes his eyes
	    back on the narrow cone of headlight-illuminated road in front
	    of him, "Well... remember when I first started to, uh... you
	    know... 'manifest' my 'psychic ability'?"

junioragentage: "Of course I remember.  I took notes."  She arches an
	    eyebrow.  "But what are you talking about specifically?" 

pupillusperpetua: "Well... uh... remember how we were able to... sense each
	    other's, uh... feelings... that one time?"  He sounds
	    uncharacteristically nervous, but only just.

laughingdog0: **Sabrina turns to alex, looking troubled.

laughingdog0: **walter studies him, the traces of a smile at the corner of
	    his mouth. 

junioragentage: The people in the back of the van see Vivian's left hand
	    suddenly freeze in her purse; in fact, her whole body freezes.
	    "Yeah..."  she says slowly, a little hoarsely.

pupillusperpetua: "Right... well... I figure, maybe I'd be able to maintain
            that connection while you're down there, down where a cellphone
            wouldn't work...  so I could sense if something started going
            wrong with you two.  And you'd have an idea what was going on
            up here..."

rob_meyers: "Probably better let Walter drive then"

pupillusperpetua: "Sure!", he responds a little too quickly, sounding
            slightly nervous again. 

junioragentage: Vivian chuckles miserably at Nate's quip.  "Yeah.  Shit.
	    It's a good idea, Alex.  Fuck.  Shit.  Shit.  Okay."

pupillusperpetua: [>:)]

laughingdog0: [another gust of wind rocks the van, making sabrina jump
            nervously] 

rob_meyers: Nate unbuckles himself and moves up to the side door

junioragentage: [Vivian jumps nervously too, although one isn't sure how
            much the wind had to do with it.] 

laughingdog0: **Sabrina looks around the van, studying everyone intently,
	    looking surprised. 

rob_meyers: "You ok?"

pupillusperpetua: "Walter, you should get ready to switch seats with me as
	    soon as we stop.  Vivian, make yourself accessible... I think I
	    have to touch you to make this work."  He doesn't sound at all
	    nervous any more.

junioragentage: Sabrina's expression knocks Vivian out of her miserable
	    reverie.  "You okay, sweetie?" 

junioragentage: Then, to Alex:  "What do you mean, accessible?"

pupillusperpetua: Alex bites out a terse laugh, "Exactly what it sounds
	    like, honey bunch." 

laughingdog0: **abruptly, she shivers again, tilting her head back, as her
	    eyes close, lines forming around her eyes and mouth.  she
	    shakes her head with a short sharp jerk, "My insides feel like
	    they're liquifying.  It's bad enough that I have to put up with
	    that three days a month -- now I get bonus."

pupillusperpetua: Alex mirth cuts off completey when Sabrina speaks.

rob_meyers: "You know what's going to happen?"

junioragentage: Vivian's ire dies immediately too, and she gives Sabrina an
	    entirely sympathetic look. 

laughingdog0: **sabrina smiles grimly, answering nate, "Yeah, I'm going to
	    die." 

rob_meyers: "Not if we can help it."

junioragentage: Firmly, to Sabrina:  "That's right.  Listen to Nate."

pupillusperpetua: Alex's two-handed grip on the steering wheel gets tight
	    enough to visibly whiten his knuckles.  Anyone paying attention
	    might notice that his jaw is clenched so hard that it cracks
	    and his jaw muscle is bulging.

laughingdog0: **sabrina shrugs slightly, then shivers again.

rob_meyers: Nate looks over whoever is in the passenger seat out the front
	    window 

rob_meyers: Nate gets out of Walter's way as he moves up

laughingdog0: **walter moves forward, gripping the back of the right seat
	    as he slides in between the seats, his left hand finds its way
	    onto alex's shoulder as he says quietly, "It'll be okay.  We
	    stay focused."

pupillusperpetua: Alex manages to push the words "Focused.  Right.  Okay."
	    from between his teeth. 

laughingdog0: **walter nods as he settles into the passenger seat, looking
	    serious. 

laughingdog0: [gm waits for stragglers]

rob_meyers: [ok]

junioragentage: [ready]

pupillusperpetua: [ready]

laughingdog0: [the van travels along the winding road, eventually arriving
	    at a part of the road where a good fifty yards of trees have
	    been removed, leaving only dirt and gravel.  off to the right
	    is a short gravel road which ends in a large rusting fence,
	    with a very heavy guage chain and lock.]

rob_meyers: Once the van stops, Nate slides open the door and heads to the
	    gate with the bolt cutters 

junioragentage: As Nate exits the van, Vivian looks at Alex, nervously(?).
	    "All right.  What do you need to do to make this happen?" 

laughingdog0: **walter shakes his head and hops out, "Nate's going to need
	    help.  We'll swap at the mine?" 

pupillusperpetua: [Wait, have we stopped then?]

rob_meyers: [were you going to drive through the gate?]

junioragentage: [GM's call]

laughingdog0: [well, alex's call, really.  did he stop at the gate or try
	    to go through it?] 

pupillusperpetua: Alex jerks a nod, "Yeah, at the mine.  Hurry!"

pupillusperpetua: [stopped]

rob_meyers: Ok, so Nate and Walter are outside

junioragentage: Vivian seems to be waiting for Alex's cue, although she
	    keeps glancing over at Sabrina. 

laughingdog0: **walter nods, turns and trots over to nate.  They study the
	    chain for a second, then walter says, "I'll get the bottom
	    handle, you lean on it."

rob_meyers: "Ok"

pupillusperpetua: Alex half turns to say to Vivian, "I guess I might as
	    well try this now... here, sit right next to me." 

laughingdog0: **walter: "IF this doesn't work <pausing for the wind to die
	    down> I'm going to have to sledge it open."

rob_meyers: "The sledge is in the van by the side door"

junioragentage: Vivian frowns, wrinkles her nose.  "Oh-kay..."  She goes
	    over and sits next to Alex. 

rob_meyers: "Behind the passenger seat"

pupillusperpetua: Alex inhales a big breath, pauses, exhales slowly, then
	    says in a slightly more relaxed voice, "Okay... I need you to
	    just... I don't know... relax your mind.  Don't
	    resist... just... open your mind up, I guess.  And your
	    emotions."

pupillusperpetua: "...try meditating?"

junioragentage: [Empathy on Alex.]

pupillusperpetua: [Fire away.   You get 3x.  He's resisting, sorta.]

junioragentage: [4 successes.]

pupillusperpetua: [only 1 success]

junioragentage: [General emotional state, but esp. towards Vivian.]

laughingdog0: **walter holds onto the lower handle as nate pretty much
	    starts throwing his weight on the upper handle while they
	    wiggle it back and forth, at first it seems absurd, too big a
	    chain, too small a tool, but eventually, they shift back on the
	    handle, and reluctantly the steel starts to groove around the
	    hard steel of the cutters

laughingdog0: [it's slow going, taking nearly a minute of grunting effort,
	    and twisting back and forth.  when the link finally goes,
	    there's a numbing clack, and a rattle as the heavy guage chain
	    falls away, then slithers through the gate to mostly puddle on
	    the ground.]

rob_meyers: Nate pulls the chain out and pushes the gate open

junioragentage: Vivian stares at Alex for a while, ignoring the sounds of
            the boys outside clanking away.  Finally, she gives him a very
            serious, thoughtful look, and says "Okay.  Go ahead."  And
            then, *very* quietly: "Please don't hurt me."

laughingdog0: **sabrina watches this in silence, only a hint of pain around
	    her eyes and mouth. 

pupillusperpetua: Alex stiffens for a moment, then furrows his brow in
	    concentration, "I'll... try... now try to relax."  He reaches
	    out a hand to touch her temple lightly.

junioragentage: She doesn't flinch, just closes her eyes and tries to go
            along with it. 

junioragentage: Does Vivian feel a spell taking effect?

pupillusperpetua: [accessing...]

laughingdog0: [may I put it all here, so rob doesn't get bored?]

rob_meyers: [I'm having my own fun taking those quotes out of context]

laughingdog0: [great.]

pupillusperpetua: [fine with me ;)]

laughingdog0: [vivian...you sit waiting anxiously, watching as alex reaches
	    out and touches your temple lightly, his fingers cool from
	    their earlier bloodless deathgrip on the steering wheel.  as
	    she waits, search, trying to feel
	    even...something...anything....]

laughingdog0: [...she has an instant to feel a warm tingle where his
            fingers are touching, then a warmth that ripples perhaps not
            unpleasantly down her spine]

junioragentage: Vivian unconsciouly arches her back at that sensation.

laughingdog0: [gm waits for noise....]

pupillusperpetua: [processing]

pupillusperpetua: [sorry guys]

junioragentage: Vivian's face shows these emotions, in order: moderate
	    fear, sympathy, guilty pleasure, then intense sadness, which
	    quickly tapers off until her face goes almost blank.

laughingdog0: [at about this moment, walter pulls open the door of the van,
	    as nate slides open the side door in the back] 

pupillusperpetua: Alex's eyes pop open as the spell connects, his eyes
	    widen slightly, and then he sighs, looking as if he suddenly
	    had to carry a small mountain on his shoulders.
	    "You're... going to have to let me feel, when you get down
	    there.  or this was a waste of my energy."  He slumps slightly,
	    seeming more tired than he had been.

rob_meyers: "Vivian, are you ready?"

laughingdog0: [the wind skirls about inside the van for a moment, whipping
	    hair, clothes and any stray bits of paper around] 

rob_meyers: Nate grabs the flashlight, flares, knife, and crowbar

junioragentage: Vivian seems to be having trouble meeting Alex's gaze.
	    When Nate speaks, she turns quickly to face him.  "Yeah.
	    Ready."  She gets her purse and starts following Nate.

rob_meyers: "Grab the bowl"

laughingdog0: **walter looks back over the passenger seat, momentarily
	    ignoring everyone else in the van, "Hold on nate -- the
	    mindshaft is a good half mile up."

rob_meyers: "Oh, ok.  I thought it was here"

rob_meyers: Nate climbs in the van

pupillusperpetua: "We ready to go?"

laughingdog0: **walter: "Go."

junioragentage: Vivian seems very distracted, and Nate has to wrangle her
	    to get her back into the van. 

pupillusperpetua: Alex stomps on the gas as hard as he thinks the van can
	    handle. 

rob_meyers: "Ease up, this is a gravel road"

laughingdog0: [alex guns the engine, feeling his danger sense of the group
	    fade down, pushing forward on the wide gravel road, the small
	    grey stones slamming up into the undercarriage]

pupillusperpetua: Alex eases up enough to let the tires regain traction.

junioragentage: [Vivian looks over at Sabrina.  Does the rough road seem to
            be making her feel signficantly worse?] 

laughingdog0: [after a minute or two, the road widens out into a huge bowl
	    in a sort of semi artificial valley, the hillside looming up
	    out of the darkness, forming an even darker curtain against the
	    hard edged, bright stars]

laughingdog0: [sabrina is sitting back, still breathing quick and shallow,
	    blood starting to try and trickle out of her nose.  She's
	    watching alex, looking troubled, still periodically shivering
	    forcefully under nate's jacket.]

rob_meyers: Nate tucks a few flares in one back pocket, the knife in the
	    other.  He holds the crowbar in his left hand and the
	    flashlight in the other

laughingdog0: [well, if they are road flares, they proabably are stuffed
	    down the back of his pants in the small of his back -- I think
	    they'd be too big for a back pocket unless he wears size 57
	    pants]

rob_meyers: [I'm sure they'd poke out, but couldn't get jam a couple far
	    enough into his pocket so they don't fall out?] 

rob_meyers: [small of his back is fine, as long as he can move freely]

laughingdog0: [alex drives, with walter's terse instructions in his right
	    ear "stay right...be ready to turn, the main shaft is up in the
	    corner there....there's a big pumpworks in the middle....we're
	    circling it" etc]

laughingdog0: [yah, he can move freely -- he just has to tighten his belt a
	    little bit so they don't go down his pants leg] 

pupillusperpetua: Alex drives without saying much beyond brief words of
	    acknowledgement. 

junioragentage: Vivian too is very quiet and in her head until the van stops.

rob_meyers: Nate looks tense for anyone (Sabrina?) watching

laughingdog0: [when you finally see the shaft, surrounded by a small lake
	    of mud and gravel, it's almost a disappointment -- a small
	    wooden shack leaned up against the side of barren, stripped
	    cliffs, almost blending in with the granite behind it]

rob_meyers: "Simple.  Simple is good."

laughingdog0: **sabrina is watching everyone intently, concentrating on the
	    words people are saying. 

rob_meyers: "Are you ready, Vivian?"

junioragentage: "That's it?" Vivian says, clearly disappointed.  "That
	    doesn't look like a mineshaft.  That looks like the shack where
	    Cletis and Skeeter live."  The comment is very Vivian, but the
	    tone seems muted.  Then, to Nate: "As I'll ever be."

rob_meyers: Once the van stops, Nate slides the door open and steps out.
	    He'll help Vivian out of the van. 

laughingdog0: **Walter shrugs, "Don't let it fool you.  It's killed more
	    miners than a typical mine in China." 

pupillusperpetua: "Wait... Vivian, there's one more... trick I want to
	    try."  He grits his teeth. 

junioragentage: Vivian stops halfway out the door.  "Gods help me," she
	    says, semi-seriously.  "What now?"   

pupillusperpetua: Alex jams on the parking break, then launches himself
	    into the back... "It'll just take a few seconds.  Sit down.
	    Relax again..."

laughingdog0: **sabrina sits forward, a look of wide eyed intesity on her
	    face, listening. 

laughingdog0: **walter silently moves into the driver's seat.

rob_meyers: Nate looks around, to make sure nothing is approaching the van

junioragentage: Vivian gives the others a halfhearted grin.  She looks like
	    she wants to make a quip but can't quite manage it.  So, she
	    just says, "Okay."  She sits down in the center of the van,
	    cross-legged.

laughingdog0: **walter sits, staring out the front windshield, listening to
	    the cough and rattle of the van's engine. 

rob_meyers: Nate looks at the shack.  Is it locked?

pupillusperpetua: This time, Alex doesn't screw around.  He firmly, though
	    still gently, grabs Vivian's head in both hands, palms over her
	    temples, and says "Look into my eyes... don't break eye
	    contact..."  His brow furrows in deep concentration.

junioragentage: Vivian looks angry.  "This had goddam better be worth it."
            She looks Alex in the eyes. 

laughingdog0: [there's a heavy padlock on a hasp keeping a pair of
	    corrugated steel gates closed.  the gates span a total of about
	    20' or so wide, and perhaps 15' high. ]

rob_meyers: "Walter, can you help me get through that lock?"

laughingdog0: [walter glances at alex, grabs the sledge and nods, hopping
	    out the driver's door.] 

pupillusperpetua: [After 12 seconds of intense concentration, that familiar
	    warmth moves from Alex's palms into her scalp, but instead of
	    tingling down her spine, it spreads to cover her whole head,
	    then sort of... sinks into her brain.  Suddenly, she gets a
	    cacophonic, almost painful flood of alien thoughts.  As soon as
	    she realizes they aren't hers, however, they mute to silence...
	    And then Vivian hears, both in her ears as he says it loudly as
	    well as in her head, "Now... GO!"

laughingdog0: [he walks forward, hefts the sledge a moment, glances at nate
	    to make sure that he's not in the way, then with a grunt, he
	    swings it in a near full circle, grunting with the effort]

laughingdog0: [the sledge smashes into the lock, throws sparks bright
	    enough to leave an after image as the sledge thuds into the mud
	    at his feet.  Nate hears something go whizzing past his head
	    and something else splash into the mud by the doors]

rob_meyers: [Whew, Walter almost killed me *again*]

junioragentage: Vivian gets up, staggers backwards and out of the van.
            "True telepathy," she says, awestruck.  She starts to say
            something else, then stops, distracted by the boys making loud
            clanking noises outside again.

rob_meyers: Is the lock destroyed?

pupillusperpetua: Vivian sees Alex smile broadly, proudly, for just a
	    second, before he scowls, "Go!  Just go!  Save my sister!"  And
	    then the side door slams shut.

laughingdog0: [yeah, the main part of the heavy fist sized lock is in the
	    mud by the doors] 

rob_meyers: "Thanks, looks like those two are done in the van"

rob_meyers: "Vivian, don't forget the bowl"

laughingdog0: **sabrina looks shocked at alex's words, then even more so at
	    nate's, "Wait! Wait!" 

junioragentage: Vivian starts to go over to Nate and Walter; then she stops
	    as if she got slapped.  She starts pounding on the closed door.
	    "Surface thoughts only, right?!  Surface thoughts only,
	    right?!"

laughingdog0: **Eyes starting to brim with tears, sabrina yells out,
	    pulling off her seatbelt, tearing open the door, stumbling out
	    of the van, momentarily going to her knees in the mud.

rob_meyers: Nate runs back to the van.

junioragentage: Vivian stops pounding on the suddenly open door and tries
		to lift Sabrina up out of the mud.  "What-- what's wrong?" 

laughingdog0: **she stops in front of Nate, grabbing the sleeves of his
	    shirt, staring up into his eyes, "This is important.  Whatever
	    you do, don't leave the water."  She looks up into his eyes
	    searchingly, looks over at vivian, "Okay?  Just...please."

rob_meyers: Nate looks into her eyes.  "Yes.  I understand."

rob_meyers: "Got that Vivian.  We'll stick to the water"

junioragentage: Looking at Sabrina, Vivian says "Don't Leave The Water."
	    She gives each word its own weight, and nods earnestly.  "Okay.
	    Okay.  Thank you."  She turns to Nate.

rob_meyers: Nate helps her get up

pupillusperpetua: Alex hangs out of the open side door of the van...

laughingdog0: [she shivers forcefully, looks back at alex, "I know."]

rob_meyers: "Alex, we'll see you in like 15 or 20 minutes.  If we're not
	    out here, give us more time" 

laughingdog0: **sabrina turns back to nate, shaking her head, "It won't be
	    obvious, but..." she pauses, eyes brimming over. 

pupillusperpetua: Alex nods to Nate, "Vivian will tell me when you're
	    headed back out... I'll try to time it so we arrive just as you
	    do!  Be careful!  And take care of her!"  He jerks his head at
	    Vivian as he says "her".

rob_meyers: Nate nods

rob_meyers: He looks back at Sabrina

rob_meyers: "What is it?"

laughingdog0: **as soon as the lock was smashed walter walked back to the
	    van, and carelessly tossed the sledge into the passenger seat. 

laughingdog0: **sabrina, lips trembling, just shakes her head, leans into
	    nate as she shivers forcefully again, then turns and stumbles
	    back toward the van.

junioragentage: Vivian just keeps looking back and forth between Alex and
	    Sabrina, seeming flustered. 

rob_meyers: Nate straightens up.  "Let's go, Vivian"

laughingdog0: **walter sits, waiting patiently.

junioragentage: Vivian straightens up and makes a visible effort to gather
	    her composure.  "Yeah!" she says, cheerily.  "Let's go
	    spelunking!"

pupillusperpetua: [Whee, fun with spell imagery!]

laughingdog0: **walter shakes his head, muttering "Brits go spelunking.  We
	    go caving." 

rob_meyers: Nate turns on the flashlight and leads the way

junioragentage: "I'm half-English.  I'm going calunking."  Vivian grins at
	    Walter, weakly but genuinely. 

laughingdog0: **walter smirks back, muttering about 'fancy college larnin'.

rob_meyers: "Remember, we need to stay in the water"

pupillusperpetua: "Bri!  Take my hand!"  He holds his hand out to her as
	    she approaches, turns his head into the van and barks at
	    Walter, "As soon as she's in, we've gotta get mobile... they're
	    coming!"

junioragentage: [It's almost 1:00 a.m.  I hate to say it, but I gotta go.]

laughingdog0: yah, that's fine.  this is a good place to pause.

laughingdog0: thanks for showing up, everyone.

<HR><A NAME="session2"><H2>Session 2: At Yahoo</H2></A>

At that point, Walter drove the van away while vivian and nate went caving,
being very careful to stay in the water as per Sabrina's admonition.
Simultaneously, Alex, Sabrina, and Walter drove about aimlessly, waiting
for Vivian to report back to when they'd finished their business.  After an
encounter with a colony of bats, and vivian having the misfortune of
slipping down into a deep puddle of water (and losing most of her clothes
in the process), they were eventually able to find the needed cave moss and
return.  Meanwhile, Althea (having arrived back from pressing business)
returned to the flat a little before 10 to find no one home.  She called
Vivian, Nate and then finally Alex, and with some effort managed to
convince him to come and pick her up.  Shortly after a heavily armed Althea
was settled in the van, Vivian sent to Alex that they were on their way
back up the shaft.  On their way along the gravel road, Alex sensed that
everyone was climbing up in the danger sense.  After waiting for about
10-15 minutes, a soaked and wet pair of cavers saw the van arrive -- but
even as they mounted up, a swarm of red-eyed bats exploded out of the mine
and attacked.  Walter kept his wits about him and got them out onto the
road, eventually leaving the nasty aggressive and glowing-red-eyed bats
behind (though bats of all sizes and degrees of decompostition littered the
surfaces of the vehicle).  After some discussion about what constitutes
'consecrated', the group ended up going back to town and talking to the
priest to get him to bless the silver mortar and pestle (along with the
lump of cavemoss heaped in it).

After that they went and gassed up the van (with vivian going into the mini
mart and buying up a bunch of snacks and drinks and red bulls, etc.  It was
then decided that nate and vivian needed to change into clothes that
weren't soaked and to clean up.  This was done, and the van then headed
back to the warehouse to wait out the night....

*note: we swtiched to mIRC at this point which has slightly  more
capability than yahoo, which allowed a little more ability to customize the
environment....

[22:26] [Vivian] (They stopped by Vivian's flat.  Vivian had time to shower
                 and change into a new outfit with one of her long coats
                 over it.)
[22:26] [Vivian] (She had grabbed the quartz pebble, and then they were on
                 their way to the garden.)

[22:27] [Alex] (Wow, I completely dropped those last details, somehow.)

[22:28] [Vivian] (Remember, Alex chastised Vivian for "being proud of
                 confusing people" as they were heading to the garden.)

[22:28] [gm] ( right, okay -- nate got dropped off also to shower, and
             walter circled around with alex, althea, sabrina in the van
             while vivian and nate showered, etc )

[22:28] [Alex] (heh, yeah, that's right)

[22:29] [gm] ( okay -- let's say we're in the van just picking up vivian. )

[22:29] [Vivian] (they had decided that everyone needed to grab a nap
                 before we starting digging around for the verbena root)

[22:29] [Alex] (yessir)

[22:30] [gm] ( I need to think a moment to get grounded, so this gives a
             second for everyone to settle back in )

[22:30] * Vivian gives Alex a wounded look and sits in the front passenger
                 seat, pouting, as they head back to the garden.

[22:31] [gm] ( vivian, what are you wearing? I don't remember about alex,
             come to think of it... )
[22:31] [gm] ( describe what alex sees as you leave the flat and arrive at
             the van.... )

[22:32] [Vivian] (Vivian is now wearing one of her long, vintage coats, fur
                 at the collar and cuffs.  She's still wearing boots, but
                 they're no longer her Doc Martens.  Rather, they have a
                 heel, though not an overly high or pointed heel.  Her hair
                 and makeup are impeccably done.)

[22:32] [gm] ( lol, of course )

[22:33] [Vivian] (The entire look is a bit thrown off by the bright
                 yellow-and-green Super Soaker tucked under one of her arms.)

[22:33] * Alex continues to sit in the back next to Sabrina, looking pale,
          unusual dark rings under his eyes. When Vivian settles into the
          van, he pipes up in a too-high, dry sounding voice, "Don't you
          ever learn? You're just going to get another one of your prize
          antiques ruined..."

[22:34] * Vivian doesn't look back at Alex.
[22:34] [Vivian] "I'm going to be working a Ritual.  I need to be dressed
                 appropriately."

[22:34] * gm **Walter quietly pulls the van back into the street, heading
          back toward the warehouse.

[22:35] [Vivian] (Have we figured out what happened to Nate and Althea?)

[22:35] [Alex] In reply, Alex just arches a skeptical eyebrow, then leans
               backwards, tilting his head back and throwing a forearm over
               his eyes.  "Someone wake me when we get... er, there.  Where
               are we going again?"

[22:35] [Vivian] "Back to the Garden."

[22:36] [Alex] "Yeah.  There."

[22:36] * gm **Walter glances up in the rearview mirror, "The garden, I
          though -- yeah."

[22:36] [Vivian] "Walter, have you remembered whether or not you have some
                 verbena root in the Garden?"

[22:38] * gm **Walter frowns, concentrating on his driving, "I'm sure
          there's half a dozen different verbena's growing in the
          garden..." He hesitates, then shakes his head slowly, "...but I
          don't think it's usable for the purpose you want to put it to. I
          think wild verbena would suit better."

[22:39] [Vivian] (Should I do a Mysticism roll to see if Vivian agrees with
                 Walter?)

[22:39] [gm] ( sure, do 2x )

[22:39] [Vivian] (3 successes.)
[22:43] * Vivian looks thoughtful, rubbing her chin.  "Mm.  You're probably
                  right."
[22:43] [Vivian] "There are a lot of X factors, unknown elements at the
                 Garden.  That specter, for example."  She sighs.  "Okay,
                 wild verbena it is."
[22:44] * Vivian sighs again, more loudly.

[22:44] * Alex snorts softly from the backseat, barely audible over the
          noise of wind and engine.

[22:44] [Vivian] "That means we'll have to get up a couple of hours before
                 dawn and start looking."

[22:44] * gm **Walter nods, his gaze abstracted, but says nothing more on
             the matter.

[22:45] [gm] ( let's say it's rolling in toward midnight )

[22:45] * Vivian looks at Walter and smiles winningly.  "You won't tell
                 Nate if I smoke in his van, will you?"

[22:46] [Alex] "Yes."

[22:46] * gm **Walter glances up in the rearview mirror, frowning, "What
             you do with Nate's trust is your business Vivian."

[22:47] * Vivian stares at Walter.  Then she opens the window, just a
                 crack, and puts her hand in her purse.  Then, without
                 taking anything out, she withdraws her hand from the purse
                 and closes the window.
[22:47] [Vivian] "Dammit."
[22:48] * Vivian sighs loudly and stares out the window.

[22:49] [gm] ( one sec -- keep on going if you can -- I need to figure a
             couple of things out )

[22:50] * Vivian fiddles with the knobs on Nate's van's radio until she
                 finds the alternative rock station.  She puts it on
                 quietly, then leans back in her seat, drumming her fingers
                 on the armrest.

[22:51] * gm **Walter half turns when the van pulls in at a stopsign,
             looking into the backseat, "I think it might be best if I drop
             althea at the hospital. I don't want to to leave lindsey
             unprotected just now. If they're willing to move on alex...."

[22:52] * Vivian winces.  "Good point.  Shit, I hate splitting us up, but
                 good point."

[22:53] * gm **Walter glances at alex, smirks and turns to Vivian, "I'll
             have to circle around and get Nate later, after I drop you two
             off. Sleeping beauty over here probably would prefer a bed."

[22:54] [Vivian] "Sleeping what?  Oh -- I guess you mean Alex."

[22:55] * gm **Walter says, "I think we have everyone we absolutely need
             here -- Vivian to cast, Alex to give warning, Sabrina to get
             healed. I can point out some verbena in the warehouse to you,
             Vivian, but I'd prefer you didn't use it."

[22:55] [Vivian] "That's cool.  Looking at it should help later, when we're
                 trying to find some in the wild."

[22:56] * gm **Sabrina sits up little bit, still shivering, huddled under
             alex's jacket, "I doubt I could sleep if I tried."
[22:56] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "You find what I've got in the
             warehouse growing up in the hills."

[22:56] * Vivian smiles warmly, or tries to, at Sabrina.  "You should try
                 anyway."

[22:56] [gm] ( err....lemme try again... )
[22:56] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "You won't find what I've got in the
             warehouse growing up in the hills."

[22:57] * Vivian furrows her brow.  "You do know where we can find some
                 growing wild, right?  You said it was common."

[22:58] * gm **Sabrina frowns, the bones on her face too prominent, as she
             studies vivian wordlessly.
[22:58] * gm **Walter shrugs in response to vivian's question, says nothing
             more.

[22:59] [Vivian] (Empathy on Sabrian and Walter.  On a 3x check, I get 9
                 successes on Sabrina, and 2 on Walter.)
[22:59] [Vivian] (*Sabrina* and Walter.)

[23:00] [gm] ( okay, a flurry of rolls here, one sec )
[23:02] [gm] ( I'm assuming 'general state' for empathy. y'all should
               declare what it is that you're empathying for *before* you
               roll, since the exact action can affect the difficulty -- in
               some cases drastically )

[23:02] [Vivian] (yeah, general state)
[23:03] [Vivian] (if you need to alter the difficulties, I remember what I
                 rolled both times; I can redo the math)

[23:04] *** Oxryly has joined #dblf

[23:04] [gm] hey dan
[23:04] [gm] welcome

[23:04] [Oxryly] hey

[23:04] [Alex] (hola, Dan)

[23:04] [Oxryly] (don't mind me)

[23:04] [Vivian] (hey, Dan.  We're just resolving a couple of Empathy rolls
                 right now.)

[23:04] [gm] ( devo -- can you fill dan in a little bit since alex is
             basically comatose? )

[23:04] [Alex] ([--- Devon)

[23:04] [Oxryly] (lol)

[23:05] [gm] ( normally, I'd do this in a side window, but I'll do it out
             here dan's benefit -- it's pretty much how we do it in
             session, anyhow. )

[23:06] [Vivian] (I'm OK with that.  Your call.)

[23:06] [gm] ( vivian, walter isn't giving you much of anything right
             now. you think he's pretty focused on what he's doing. )
[23:08] [gm] vivian, you think sabrina is scared, and in pain, primarily
[23:08] [gm] ( and resigned )
[23:08] [gm] ( she *knows* what's going to happen to her -- or at least
             thinks she does )

[23:09] [gm] ( sabrina scored a net 2 successes on her empathy roll -- same
             thing -- where's vivian at right now? anything other than
             concerned? )

[23:11] [Vivian] (She's trying very hard to appear confident for Sabrina's
                 benefit, like any concern she has is just to figure out
                 the exact logistics of upcoming events.  With her
                 successes, though, Sabrina can sense worry and unhappiness
                 pretty clearly.)

[23:12] [Vivian] (Frustration, too.)

[23:14] * gm **Sabrina winces while she studies Vivian, her shoulders
             clenching, then sits back, breathing rapid and shallow,
             "Right." 

[23:15] * Vivian abruptly shifts her gaze to Walter.  "Are we almost there?
                 I could *really* use a cigarette."

[23:15] * gm **Walter pulls in at the hospital as vivian speaks, glances at
             Althea, "Your stop, Althea. Call if anything comes up."

[23:16] * Vivian gives Althea a goodbye hug.

[23:17] * Alex makes some incoherent noises, mumbling. He shifts around for
               a few seconds, then sits up suddenly with a soft, "Shift."

[23:18] [gm] ( okay, Althea returns vivian's hug, stuffs the sword lower
             under he long coat, the pauses as Alex speaks, "Im sorry?" )

[23:18] * Vivian looks perplexed at Alex.  "Shift?"

[23:18] [Alex] (shift... a mumbled "shit")

[23:19] * Vivian looks annoyed.  "What is it, Alex?"

[23:19] * Alex blinks himself away, rubs at one eye looking unusually
               boy-like, then shakes his head viciously, "Yeah... um... as
               soon as we stopped, you all jumped up a little on the
               Spidey-sense."

[23:19] * gm **Sabrina turns her head a little bit, opening her eyes,
             looking questioningly at alex.

[23:19] [Alex] "So, um... we should get mobile, I think."

[23:19] * gm **Walter nods thoughtfully.

[23:20] [Vivian] "That's the plan.  Run inside, Althea!"

[23:20] * gm **Althea pauses, then looks startled as everyone looks at her,
             "Right-o. I'll call if anything happens."

[23:20] * Vivian grins and waves at Althea.

[23:21] * Alex leans forward to yell after her retreating form, "Keep your
               cellphone on! Make sure you have signal! Goddamnit!"

[23:21] * gm **Althea hops out, pausing long enough to turn and wave at the
             Van as walter accelerates out of the Hospital lot.
[23:22] [gm] [ You watch as the van pulls away, Althea pausing long enough
             to pull her cell out of her jacket pocket and wave in the air,
             showing that she got the message. As walter hits the end of
             the hospital parking lot and turns onto the street, Althea
             turns and hurries into the hospital, her arm clenched over the
             sword under her jacket. ]
[23:23] * gm **Walter drives on, not hurrying, but not taking his time
             either.

[23:24] * Vivian shakes her head and chuckles ruefully.  "I hope no one
                 gives her shit for, um, y'know, bringing a fucking *sword*
                 into the hospital."

[23:24] [gm] ( what day is it? )

[23:25] [Vivian] (Very late March 15, 2003, or very early March 16, 2003.
                 I don't remember the day of the week.)

[23:25] * gm **Walter glances over at Vivian for a second, "Lindsey's not
             in a security wing. It should be okay."

[23:26] [Alex] (I think it was around 1 AM, actually)

[23:26] [Vivian] (Which makes it very early, March 16.)

[23:26] [gm] sunday morning, then.

[23:27] [Vivian] (Correct.)

[23:27] * Alex opens his mouth to make a comment, stares at the back of
               Vivian's head for a two beat, then closes his mouth and
               leans back again, groans, then mutters, "Are we there yet,
               mommy?"

[23:28] * Vivian affects a Marge Simpson voice.  "Just a little further."

[23:29] [gm] [ Walter drives up the frontage road, lucking out with
             saturday night traffic -- usually there are lots of cruisers
             just circling the strip of roadway next to the board walk, but
             the cold blustery night seems to have driven most of the usual
             boardwalk revelers home ]

[23:30] * Vivian twists in her seat and glares at Alex, suddenly.  "Hey.
                 What's wrong with Althea?  Don't you think she's cute?"

[23:31] * gm **Walter drives along the frontage road, then looks over at
             vivian after glancing up at alex in the rearview mirror, "I'm
             worried. That's twice we've met bugs. More than five miles
             apart." 
[23:32] [gm] walter: "Some of those things were huge, Vivian.  They weren't
             much bigger than your hand."
[23:33] [gm] walter: "Not when we first saw them in, what, December?"
[23:34] [gm] walter: "When Lindsey made us go to that job fair [he shakes
             his head looking for the right word in exasperation as he
             pauses] thing." 

[23:34] * Vivian glowers at Alex.  Only if he doesn't respond does she
                 then, slowly, turn to Walter.  "I didn't go to the job
                 fair.  You say they've gotten bigger?"

[23:36] * gm **Walter turns to Vivian, "From palm sized to terrier sized."

[23:44] * Vivian shakes off whatever her latest, mysterious annoyance with
                 Alex is, and looks thoughtful.  "Huh.  Could they be
                 different sub-species of the same critter?"

[23:44] * gm **Walter shrugs, turning back to the window, "Maybe."

[23:44] * Alex slumbers on in inappropriate peacefulness, still snoring too
               faintly for the people in front to hear.

[23:47] * gm **Walter stares out at the city streets as he drives,
             monitoring the intermittent (and generally noisy traffic),
             "You know rabbits in Australia, Vivian?"

[23:47] * Vivian gives Walter a perplexed giggle.  "Not personally, no.
                 Should I?"

[23:49] * gm **Walter frowns and glances at vivian, no trace of her humor
             infecting his expression, "Read up on it when we get
             back. Rabbits are harmless...these things aren't."

[23:52] * Vivian frowns at Walter, but nods.  "Okay.  I will."  She then
                 falls silent for the rest of the trip, unless someone
                 breaks the quiet. 

[23:53] * gm **Sabrina makes a strangled little noise in the back of her
             throat, which abruptly and quickly rises to a short piercing,
             forceful shriek.

[23:54] * Vivian jumps about a foot in the air (no seatbelt).  She wheels
                 to face Sabrina.  "What?!  What?!"

[23:54] * gm **Walter hunches forward, murmurs through gritted teeth,
             "We're almost there, then I can pick up Nate."

[23:55] * Alex sucks in an breath, twitches, then pushes his head upright,
               raising a hand in a defensive gesture, mumbles thickly,
               inarticulately, then manages to form the words, "Wha? What?
               Sabrina?"

[23:55] * gm **Sabrina has leaned forward, hugging her midsection, her
             teeth clenched, eyes squinched shut.

[23:55] * Vivian looks very worried, and starts awkwardly making her way
                 through the van towards Sabrina.  "Sweetie, what's wrong?
                 What is it?" 

[23:57] * gm **Sabrina , without a trace of her usual venom, almost
             whispers, "What the fuck do you think is wrong? 24 to 48 hours
             you said?  This is just the fucking beginning."

[23:58] * Vivian bites her lower lip and narrows her eyes.  Then, to Alex:
                 "Where is she on your radar?  Did she jump up?"

[23:59] * Alex frowns at the both of them, a mix of consternation and
               something resembling annoyance, "Ehhgh... no. No, she's on
             the low end, still." His voices drops to a loud, hoarse
             whisper, "It's the symptoms getting vicious again..."

[00:00] * Vivian, to Sabrina:  "Did you take those painkillers I gave
                 you?"

[00:01] * gm **Sabrina, eyes still tightly squiched shut, just shakes her
             head once sharply after a brief hesitation.

[00:02] [Vivian] "If you think you can keep them down, you should take
                 them.  Please."

[00:02] [Alex] (who had 'em last?)

[00:02] [Vivian] (Alex and Sabrina were passing them back and forth; I
                 don't know who kept them.)
[00:04] * Vivian looks earnestly at Alex.  "Do you still have them?  I have
                 more, if you lost them."

[00:04] * gm **Sabrina just shakes her head, "I think I feel a little
             sick."

[00:04] [Alex] "Yeah, hermanita...  I think it's past time you took
               something."  He studies Vivian for a moment, then leans over
               to fish the little bastards out of his breast pocket,
               "Here..."

[00:05] [gm] [ the van begins to slow as walter looks up, we can park on
             the property, or you guys can jump out. ]

[00:06] * Vivian grabs Alex's arm.  "If she's feeling nauseous, they'll
                 just make it worse."  Then, loudly: "Walter!  Do you have
                 any stomach medicine at your place?"

[00:06] [gm] [ the van bounces on its suspension after a hard gust of wind
             blows past ]

[00:07] * Vivian loses her balance as the van bounces and grabs onto Alex's
                 shoulder to keep from falling.  She quickly pulls her
                 hands back once the bouncing stops.

[00:08] * gm **Walter looks back at vivian, slowly shakes his head, "I have
             beer, vodka, and whatever else you've left there. Some power
             tools also, I guess."
[00:09] [gm] walter: do you guys want to get out and walk to the warehouse,
             or does someone want to jump out and open the gate so I drive
             onto the property.
[00:09] [gm] walter: "I'd rather not try and drive through the fence. [he
             glances at alex] once was enough."

[00:09] [Vivian] "I'll jump out and open the gate.  Alex, stay with
                 Sabrina."

[00:10] * Vivian moves to the side door of the van.

[00:10] * Alex reaches up instinctively to grab Vivian by the waist to help
               steady her. Once stabilized, he retracts his hands more
               calmly, gives her a smile that's all tiredness.

[00:10] [Alex] (Slow down, muchachos.)

[00:11] * Vivian stares at Alex and Sabrina, wordlessly, until the van
                 slows enough for her to open the door and jump out.

[00:11] [Alex] (of course, I'm done now o.O)

[00:12] [gm] ( a little reminder doesn't hurt once in awhile )
[00:13] [gm] [ the van slows down as it rounds the corner behind the
             warehouse, the wind making a dull roaring against its shell ]

[00:14] * Vivian slides the door open.  "A little slower,
                 Walter... slower... okay!"  Vivian jumps out of the van
                 and heads for the gate.

[00:14] [gm] [ Vivian jumps after opening the door as walter pulls up
             alongside the gate, hurrying over to the fence while her
             jacket swirls about her, the wind kicking up spume from the
             ocean, making the air moist. ]

[00:15] * Vivian , with what, for her, is a great deal of effort, gets the
                 gate open enough for the van to pull in.  She's wincing
                 visibly and favoring one of her feet.

[00:16] [gm] [ she fiddles with the chain loosely fastened through the
             chainlink, the cuffs of her jacket repeatedly getting in the
             way thanks to the wind, then pushes the gate, surprised to
             find that the track is oiled and smooth, despite its rusty and
             forgotten appearance. ]

[00:17] * Vivian grins delightedly when she realizes opening the gate is
                 much easier than she'd feared.

[00:18] [gm] [ walter eases the van through as soon as there's room,
             immediately making a hard right to get off the gravel path,
             then circling around to leave side door facing the warehouse,
             leaving vivian behind. ]

[00:19] * gm **Sabrina stays hunched over, arms around her midsection,
             letting her head rest on her knees, clenching her fists as the
             van hits a couple of rough patches. she makes a slight whimper
             in the back of her throat.

[00:19] [gm] [ gm pauses, waiting for stragglers ]

[00:19] * Vivian lights a cigarette with her wind-defeating Calibri
                 lighter, then, smoking, slowly follows the van to the
                 warehouse proper and comes inside.

[00:20] * Alex spends most of the wait watching Sabrina. (and that's about
               it, sadly)

[00:20] [gm] [ Vivian, you can smell the salt in the air and hear the surf
             pounding on the rocky beach not half a mile away. very
             distantly, you can hear the fog horn on drakes island sound. ]

[00:22] * Vivian finishes her cigarette and drops it into her travel
                 ashtray before coming inside and rejoining the others.

[00:22] [gm] [ walter pulls in along the wall of the warehouse, passing a
             beaten up red pickup truck, and a large stack of lumber lying
             alongside the warehouse. He stops the van, then stands up and
             turns to see what assistance he can offer alex (though he
             leaves the engine idling) ]

[00:23] [gm] [ gm pauses to wait for stragglers...ie, alex ]

[00:23] [Alex] (hold up)

[00:24] [gm] ( okay )

[00:24] [Alex] As the van idles to a stop and the engine drops off, Alex
               puts a light hand on Sabrina's shoulder and leans down to
               offer in that hoarse whisper, "Okay, we're here... can you
               walk?  I can help..."

[00:25] [Alex] (go)

[00:26] * gm **Sabrina looks up at alex, something in his voice making her
             brows furrow. AFter studying him for a moment she says
             quietly, "I can walk, but I think I need to puke first."

[00:27] * Alex recoils an inch, mouth tightening, "yeah, uh, okay,
               well... come on, then, out of Nate's car. I doubt he'd want
               any -new- 'special' smells added to this things,
               um... 'character'".

[00:27] * gm **Walter moves forward and opens the van door.
[00:28] * gm **Sabrina 's lips tremble for a moment, then she nods,
             fumbling with the seatbelt, her hair sliding forward, covering
             her face. 

[00:28] [Alex] (+sound of the engine drops off... grrr)
[00:29] * Alex stands, moves towards the door, scowling, nods to Walter,
               "Might want to back up... she's about to lose anything she
               had for dinner."  He turns and offers strong hands to help
               Sabrina move forward and out of the van.

[00:30] [gm] [ after a moment, sabrina manages get the seatbelt off, then
             stands, walking on slightly wobbly legs, making no comment as
             alex moves support her with hands on her waist. ]
[00:32] [gm] [ the wind immediately blasts the inside of the van as soon as
             the doop opens, and a moment later, you and walter help her
             out of the van. as soon as sabrina and alex are standing,
             walter steps back up into the van, and closes the door behind
             him. ] 

[00:32] [Vivian] (Assuming it was unlocked, Vivian is waiting for the
                 others inside the warehouse.)

[00:33] [gm] [ vivian, they got there well ahead of you -- you can see
             walter in the driver's seat as he turns back and goes into the
             back of the van, then there's a pause ]
[00:34] [gm] [ a moment later, you see him return to the driver's side, put
             the van in gear and begin driving around back in your general
             direction ] 

[00:34] [Vivian] (oh, okay... just let me know when she hooks back up with
                 the group.)

[00:34] [gm] [ I'm going to deal with vivian for a second unless alex
             pre-empts walter...? ]

[00:34] [Alex] (nein)
[00:34] [Alex] (following Sabrina's lead at this point)

[00:35] * Vivian sees Walter driving towards her and sticks out a thumb,
                 hitchhiker-style.

[00:35] [gm] [ walter drives along the path, pulling up alongside vivian,
             rolling down the window. He leans out the window, and in a
             deep breathy voice, intones, "I've got some candy little girl,
             wanna _ride_?" ] 

[00:36] * Vivian gives Walter a wide-eyed, silly grin.  "Candy?  Ooh... I
                 *love* candy."  She hops into the van.

[00:37] [gm] [ without waiting for vivian's response (or talking over her
             if he has to), he says, "the verbena is a spiky white
             flower. I think there's a largish patch near the beachward
             tree. it smells kind of musty, and has hairy, meaty stems." ]

[00:37] * gm **Walter adds, "I'm heading over to nate's place. I'll be back
             as soon as I can."

[00:38] [Vivian] "The 'beachward tree'?  Where's that, in the garden?"

[00:38] [gm] walter: "Yeah.  By the meditation pool."

[00:39] * Vivian looks worried, and speaks softly, imploringly:  "You do
                 know where to find some outside of the Garden, right?"
          
[00:41] * gm **Walter, his attention already almost completely on something
             else is immediately focused back on Vivian. Staring into his
             shadowy grey eyes, you get the impression that maybe this is
             the first time you've ever fully had his attention. For one
             brief second, his intensity makes you wonder how anyone could
             willingly throw down with him.

[00:42] [gm] walter: "Yes and no.  I'll be back soon."
[00:42] [gm] [ He slaps the side of the van a couple times as he turns
             forward, his gaze already abstracted as he continues on his
             way. ] 

[00:43] * Vivian stares quietly at Walter for a few seconds, then lets him
                 go.  "Hurry back!"

[00:43] [gm] [ focuses back on alex ]

[00:43] * Vivian then heads into the warehouse to join up with Alex and
                 Sabrina.
[00:44] [Vivian] (Let me know at what point Vivian meets up with either or
                 both of them in the warehouse.)

[00:45] [gm] [ alex, almost as soon as walter closes the door, Sabrina
             lurches forward, putting her left hand up against the
             warehouse wall as she's noisily sick. after a moment, she
             begins to sink down to her knees. ] 

[00:45] [Alex] (Christ, one sec)

[00:45] [gm] ( vivian: okay )

[00:47] * Alex just stands behind her, making sure none of her hair or
               anything else gets in the path of the oncoming mess, then
               crouches next to her, keeping a hand on her shoulder to
               support her, keep her upright.

[00:49] [gm] [ Alex, she heaves for a long while, at the last just gagging
             helplessly on an empty stomach. By the time Vivian strolls up,
             her jacket swirling around her ankles in the sea-salt smelling
             air, you're mostly supporting her weight. ]
[00:51] [gm] [ Whatever she had in her stomach was black in the moonlight
             and mostly liquid -- at least, that's what you think from the
             quick glances out of the corners of your eyes. You're aware of
             Vivian as she approaches, pausing by your elbow as Sabrina's
             spasm calms, then stops. ]

[00:51] [gm] [ gm waits for stragglers ]

[00:51] * Vivian looks wide-eyed and upset at the scene before her.  To
                 Alex:  "Get her inside, as soon as you can.  I've got
                 something that will ease her stomach."

[00:52] * Alex has both hands under her arms, holding her at a 30 degree
               angle from the ground to facilitate the cleanest possible
               vomit experience. As soon as Vivian walks up, he looks up at
               her with an ugly look on his face. He nods in response to
               her comment, then says very quietly, "Whomever did this is
               going to -suffer-..." (Doug, make an empathy roll if you
               think it's appropriate)

[00:53] [Vivian] (6 successes on 3x)

[00:54] [Alex] (yipe, er... okay, thinking)

[00:54] * gm **Sabrina shakes her head weakly, her lips and voice sounding
             moist as she says, "It would have been worse if it bit you."

[00:55] * Alex ignores Sabrina, still staring up at Vivian. His eyes are
               narrowed, tight with anger, and she (with her successes) can
               not only see in them, but sense in him rage rolling off him
               in waves, cold, determined, and utterly focused. She has
               never, -ever- seen him like this before, except once --
               (cont'd)
[00:58] [Alex] Once, when they were young and more foolish in most ways.
               She's reminded of a story he'd told her about Sabrina and
               her father, the only time he described in any specificity
               the sort of horrors he inflicted on Sabrina as a child,
               right before going into a sort of adolescent violent rage,
               breaking some of his mother's absently treasured household
               decorations.  She learned never to feed him absinthe again,
               that night.
[01:00] [Alex] "Help me get her inside?"  His voice cracks at the end, and
               his posture relaxes, almost crumples in on himself as the
               fire snuffs out of him just as quickly as it came.

[01:01] * gm **Sabrina murmurs fussily as Vivian and Alex flank her, "I can
             still walk."

[01:01] * Vivian's eyes widen.  She shakes a little bit, almost taking a
                 step back, but she holds her ground.  Then, quietly but
                 clearly: "Alex.  Sabrina.  Both of you need to hold on.
                 We'll get through this, I promise.  But you need to hold
                 on.  For each other, if not for yourselves."

[01:03] * Vivian stays near Sabrina, but lets her walk under her own power,
          if she's able.  "Okay?"

[01:04] * Alex just nods quietly, both to Vivan and Sabrina. A hoarse, "I
               know... thanks..." for Vivian, and then, bending down to
               Sabrina's level, he grins at her, mutters, "Yeah, yeah... I
               swear, your head must be made of solid concrete. Now let us
               help you inside."

[01:06] * gm **Sabrina looks at vivian, her eyes catching too much of the
             moonlight, her lips reflecting moist and black. When alex
             speaks, she turns to face him, then forces a weak smile,
             "Oak. At least they can polish mine to look good on a bed
             post."

[01:06] [gm] [ okay? forward? ]

[01:06] [Alex] (okay with me... doug?)

[01:07] [Vivian] (good to go)
[01:08] * Vivian walks inside with the two of them until they get Sabrina
                 settled down somewhere.  Then she turns away and starts
                 fiddling with something in her purse.

[01:09] [gm] ( okay -- one sec -- afk for half a minute )
[01:13] [gm] [ sabrina is mostly able to walk on her own, albeit slowly;
             though she makes no effort to shake off anyone helping
             her. You enter the interior of the warehouse, walking along
             one of the narrow wooded paths toward the living spaces, the
             lights overhead giving soft illumination, bringing out the
             vibrant colors of the garden. ]
[01:15] [gm] [ as you walk, vivian falls half a pace behind since the path
             is only wide enough for two to pass. Alex, as you walk you at
             first wonder when sabrina had time to put on such gaudy red
             makeup, but it only takes a moment to realize that it's not
             bright red lipstick ]
[01:16] [gm] [ she looks paler and more skeletal under the lights, and she
             continues to breathe quickly and shallowly, her shivering
             having increased to the point where she has to pause
             occasionally for the suddering to abate. ]

[01:17] * Alex supports Sabrina on the way in, hands under her armpits with
               him positioned off to one side. He doesn't react immediately
               to the blood on her lips.

[01:18] [gm] [ the wind is muted, but even within the warehouse you hear
             it, even the crash of the waves outside faintly
             audible. Though it probably only takes a couple minutes to
             traverse the interior, it feels like a long time, the uneven
             sloping ground seeming to impede progress. ]

[01:18] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[01:18] [Vivian] (ready)

[01:21] [gm] [ okay ]
[01:22] [gm] [ so, moments (though it feels like hours) later, you arrive
             at the table set up in front of the entrance to the living
             spaces. without prompting, sabrina makes her way to one of the
             chairs, and settles heavily into it. ]

[01:23] * Vivian hands Sabrina a small, shiny, black pipe along with her
                 lighter.  "Have some.  It'll ease your stomach."

[01:23] [gm] [ and here is where I'll hit the pause button. ]
[01:24] [gm] thanks for showing up, gentlemen.

<A NAME="session4"><H2>Session 4: IRC</H2></A>

[22:22] [Nate] ( recap? I heard I didn't miss all that much last session. )

[22:23] [gm] [ okay, so IIRC, sabrina had retched violently with alex at
             her side while walter and vivian spoke, just prior to walter
             driving off in the van to pick up nate ]

[22:23] [Alex] ( not really, no... it's all there on this web page IRC
               session thingy)

[22:23] [Vivian] We had just made it all the way back to the warehouse from
                 Spivey Shaft, having stopped by Nate's (briefly) and
                 Vivian's (less briefly) so they could get cleaned up and
                 change clothes.

[22:24] [Alex] (There was some deep melodrama, too.)

[22:24] [Vivian] Everyone's nerves were rather frayed (especially Alex's
                 and Sabrina's), and Sabrina was very ill and getting
                 worse.

[22:24] [gm] [ from there, vivian and alex were helping sabrina along the
             indoor paths after entering though the break in teh back wall
             of the warehouse in the garden ]

[22:24] [Nate] Nate waits outside for the group to return. 

[22:24] [gm] [ and yes, there was some pretty damned deep melodrama ]
[22:25] [gm] [ so, let's back up a little bit for a context. alex, vivian,
             you guys are walking through the garden, hearing the keeing of
             the wind outside, while sabrina is walking between you ]

[22:25] [Vivian] (The group was going inside the warehouse to grab a few
                 hours' sleep, if possible, before hunting for the verbena
                 root an hour or two before dawn.  So if Nate's waiting
                 outside the warehouse, he'll be standing there fore quite
                 some time.)

[22:26] [Nate] ( Nate was waiting outside of his apartment.  After about 15
               minutes, he'd wait inside )

[22:26] [Alex] (I have a good means of starting this off, if no one had
               anything they wanted to do right away?)

[22:26] [Vivian] (Go for it.  Vivian was trying to get Sabrina to smoke
                 some "stomach medicine," but that can happen at any point.)

[22:26] [gm] ( fire away. anyone with objections? )
[22:27] [gm] [ okay. you guys are walking, sabrina between you, breathing
             fast and shallow, her lips appearing very very red, when.... ]
[22:27] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[22:28] [Nate] ( all caught up here )

[22:28] * Vivian is walking with her arms free, ready to catch Sabrina if
                 she falls in her direction.

[22:29] [gm] [ sabrina still walks under her own power, but she has to
             pause occasionally when her shivering becomes to intense to
             wait it out; all the while breathing fast and shallow ]
[22:31] [gm] [ gm notes that alex is writing a novel. ]

[22:31] * Alex walks along, supporting most of Sabrina's weight. After
               several steps into the nearly tropical warmth of the
               warehouse and out of the cold night air, Alex slows to a
               stop, still supporting Sabrina... and straightens up,
               drawing in a long, slow breath, "What the... fuck?"

[22:32] * Vivian , startled, looks at Alex.  "What?  What is it?"

[22:33] * gm **Sabrina pauses, turning to look at alex

[22:33] * Vivian starts nervously scanning the room.

[22:34] * Alex shakes his head, like he's trying to clear it... after a few
               seconds of staring up towards the ceiling, he turns his head
               and focuses on Vivian, "There's... there's someone new. I
               think..." His voice cracks on the "new".

[22:34] * Vivian arches an eyebrow.  "New?  What do you mean new?"
[22:35] * Vivian 's eyes go wide.  "Did someone new pop up on your 'spidey
                 sense'?"

[22:36] * Alex shakes his head again, more vigorously, then frowns at Nate,
               "Nate... could you take her... for a second?" He sounds and
               looks very distant.

[22:36] [Nate] ( Nate's here? )

[22:36] [Alex] (wait, nevermind)
[22:36] [Alex] (He's not, right?)

[22:36] [Vivian] (He's waiting inside his apartment)

[22:36] [Nate] ( Nate's waiting for the group to pick him up )

[22:37] [gm] [ nate, even over the wind, you can hear the hollow roar of
             the blue monster approaching your apartment. ]

[22:37] [Nate] Nate quickly gets his stuff together and gets outside

[22:37] [Alex] (Whoah... uh... did we just fast forward?)

[22:37] [Vivian] (No.. Walter left to pick up Nate, remember?)

[22:38] [Alex] (Roger.  Caught up now.)
[22:38] [Alex] (lemme retry this)
[22:38] * Alex shakes his head again, more vigorously, then frowns at
               Vivian, "Viv... could you take her... for a second?" He
               sounds and looks very distant.
[22:39] * Alex jumps suddenly as the sound of Eminem starts barking from
               his jacket pocket. "Er... shit!"

[22:39] * Vivian looks concerned, and a little annoyed, but mostly
                 concerned.  "Yeah... I mean, yes, of course."  She picks
                 up the slack that Sabrina needs for support as Alex lets
                 her go.

[22:39] * gm **Sabrina looks at alex, her expression betraying worry and
             fear, "What? what's going on?"
[22:40] * gm **Sabrina doesn't resist the contact as alex lets vivian take
             over, but she's mostly standing on her own. she tries not to
             lean too heavily on vivian, but shows no intention of leaving
             without alex

[22:40] * Alex takes a halfstep to the side, waving Sabrina off with a
               faintly impatient expression while fishing his phone out of
               his jacket with his other hand. He flips it open
               one-handedl, then raises it to his ear and, in Russian,
               "Viktor? Hello?"

[22:41] * Vivian lets Sabrina take as much of her own weight as she can,
                 but doesn't let her go, either.
[22:42] * Vivian whispers to Sabrina, "Viktor?  Who's Viktor?"

[22:43] * gm **Sabrina cuts her eyes to vivian briefly, then shakes her
             head slowly as she focuses back on alex. while she listens in,
             she winces, breifly puts more of her weight on Vivian's arm,
             then after a second is once again standing on her own.

[22:48] * Alex converses in angry, rushed sounding Russian on the
               phone. Angry and rushed even for Russian. It's heavily
               punctuated by what even Vivian is pretty sure is Russian
               swearing.

[22:49] * Vivian whispers to Sabrina, "What are they talking about?"

[22:49] [Alex] After about two minutes of this, Alex moves to support
               Sabrina again, nods to the other two to start walking...

[22:50] * Vivian "What was that all about?"

[22:51] * Alex is still barking away into the phone. He shakes his head at
               Vivian with an -ugly- look on his face, mouths the word
               "family" very carefully in between Russian growls.

[22:51] [gm] [ the three of you move forward, walking through the lush,
             near tropical interior of the warehouse. ]

[22:51] * Vivian shoots Sabrina an inquisitive look.

[22:52] * gm **Sabrina catches vivian's glance, but just shakes her head,
             "I don't know. I've never met Viktor."

[22:52] * Vivian tries to steer the three of them towards a chair that
                 Sabrina can sit down in.

[22:54] [gm] [ sabrina walks stiffly but after a couple of minutes, manages
             to arrive near the living spaces, settling in at the little
             glass and steel table that walter's set up. Sabrina settles
             heavily into a chair, then slowly leans back, eyes closed, a
             little red dribble starting to run down the left side of her
             mouth. ]

[22:55] * Alex paces around after Sabrina drops off, then paces away, off
               and out into the garden, well out of hearing range of the
               others.

[22:55] * Vivian watches Alex leave, then looks concerned at Sabrina.  She
                 hands Sabrina a clean tissue, then makes a wiping motion
                 by her own lip.

[22:56] [Alex] (Nate's cell starts ringing)

[22:56] [Nate] Nate answers.

[22:57] [gm] ( rob, do you have an /me command in your irc client? )

[22:57] [Alex] "Nate!  Hey, did Walter find you yet?!"

[22:57] * Nate says, "He hasn't dropped by yet"

[22:58] [Nate] "Are you guys at the Garden?"

[22:59] [Alex] "Yeah.  Okay, look... I need you to do me a favor, all
               right?  I need you to pick up a friend of mine.  A cousin,
               actually."

[23:00] [Nate] "What the fuck? dont' we need to get that plant for Vivian's
               spell?"
[23:00] [Nate] "Does he live in Happy Valley?"

[23:00] [Alex] "Yeah.  He's near you, actually.  You can get him now or on
               the way back from grabbing that root stuff."

[23:01] [Nate] "Might as well get him now, except I don't have the van."

[23:02] [Alex] "Yeah.  I mean now, right after Walter gets you..."

[23:03] * Vivian digs in her purse for a minute before coming up with a
                 small black pipe and a Bic lighter.  She holds them out
                 for Sabrina.  "'Medicine.'  For your stomach."

[23:04] * gm **Sabrina takes vivian's kleenex, looks at it for a second,
             then after vivian mimes wiping her mouth, sabrina follows
             suit, pausing to glance at the used tissue in her hand as she
             folds it half for another pass. then freezes, staring at the
             bright red stain.
[23:05] * gm **Sabrina stares, her eyes growing wider as lips move a little
             bit, then she rubs the kleenex against her lips more roughly,
             mumbling under her breath.

[23:07] * Vivian notices Sabrina's reaction but tries gamely to keep
                 smiling.  She wiggles the pipe and the lighter a little
                 bit.  "It'll make you feel better.  Honest."

[23:08] * gm **Sabrina's eyes begin to fill with tears as she begins to
             scrub vigorously, mumurring a quiet denial, her actions
             beginning to take on a more hysterical timbre.
[23:09] [gm] [ nate, at this point, you're on the way back to the warehouse
             via Viktor's place first? Viktor realistically lives in the
             tenderloing area of happy valley ]
[23:10] [gm] [ nate, are you driving, or are you leaving walter behind the
             wheel? ]

[23:10] * Nate fills Walter in on the "pick up Viktor" side quest
[23:10] * Nate drives his own van

[23:10] * Vivian puts the pipe and the lighter down on the table near
                 Sabrina, and puts a hand on her shoulder.
                 "Sabrina... it'll be OK."  Then, more confidently: "It
                 will."

[23:14] * gm **Sabrina doesn't seem to notice as she just stares at the
             blood on the kleenex and on her hands, tearfully exclaiming,
             "What the fuck is this? [screaming] WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
             SHIT?" She hurls the tissues away from herself with a sharp
             sudden movement, as she settles back into the chair, then
             crumples into her self.

[23:16] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[23:16] * Vivian turns her head to the side and yells in a remarkably loud
                 and clear voice, "ALEX!  GET IN HERE!!"  She then puts an
                 arm around Sabrina (whether or not Sabrina seems to want
                 her to).  "It'll be OK.  It *will,*" she says again.

[23:19] * gm **Sabrina doesn't seem to notice vivian's contact. She weeps
             for a second, then screams wordlessly, only slightly muffled
             by her face pressed into knees.

[23:20] * Vivian puts her other arm around Sabrina, and starts looking
                 around frantically for Alex.

[23:31] * Nate pulls his van in front of the address Alex gave him

[23:32] [gm] ( viktor, what does nate see when he arrives? )

[23:33] [Viktor] (ah I'm ready for this)
[23:33] [Viktor] (Viktor is nearly 300 lbs of fairly ugly muscle with an
                 infectious smile. He is bald, hulking, and generally gives
                 off a positive vibe. He moves with speed and ease despite
                 his bulk.)
[23:33] [Viktor] "Ah you must be Nate!"

[23:34] [Nate] "Viktor?"

[23:34] * Viktor play fights Nate a little.

[23:34] [Nate] "Hop in, we gotta book to the warehouse."

[23:34] [Viktor] "Good to meet you."

[23:34] [Nate] ( Nate doesn't leave the driver's seat )

[23:34] [Viktor] (oh, ok)

[23:34] [Nate] "You're Alex's cousin?"

[23:34] [gm] [ and with that, y'all are on the way.... ]

[23:34] [Viktor] "Yes. We are old friends too..."

[23:36] [gm] [ okay, alex -- you head off to talk on the phone, but after a
             couple of minutes you hear some shouting/screaming -- you
             might want to review some of the main chat since stuff
             happened that might involve you ]

[23:37] [Alex] (oy)
[23:38] * Alex comes charging back into the clearing (or wherever the other
               two are), unnaturally short on breath, "What?! What's going
               on?!" His voice cracks twice, also uncharacteristic.

[23:39] * Vivian , still holding Sabrina, looks at Alex, looks pointedly at
                 the bloody Kleenex sitting on the table by Sabrina, then
                 looks back at Alex.  But all she says is, "She needs you."

[23:41] * Alex follows Vivian's gaze to the Kleenex, then scowls at them
               both, "She needs a witch doctor, a priest, or this fucking
               ritual!" But he's moving to stand next to her, to bend down
               and put a hand on the back of her head. Then he just stands
               there, patting her head lightly, looking extremely
               uncertain.

[23:41] * gm **Sabrina is sitting, curled up in a chair, knees pulled up to
             chest with her face buried in her hands, weeping with great
             rib-cracking sobs.

[23:42] * Vivian lets go of Sabrina, slowly, then backs a step away.  She
                 looks at Alex and says, quietly, "We'll gather the root as
                 soon as the boys get back.  Then we'll do the ritual at
                 dawn.  But for now... just hold her... all right?"

[23:44] * Alex stares for a long time at Vivian as if she were insane and
               speaking ancient Greek. Then he just scowls at her and looks
               away, the dark rings and bloodless cheeks making him look
               ten years older...

[23:46] * Vivian 's eyes widen, and her jaw goes tight.  "Alex?  God damn
                 it, did you hear me?"

[23:48] * Nate calls out, "Hello?"

[23:49] * Vivian just stares at Alex for a few more seconds.  Then she
                 calls out, "Over here!  By the glass table!"

[23:49] * Nate leads Viktor to the table area

[23:50] [Viktor] Hello everyone

[23:50] * Nate looks at Sabrina, wincing.  

[23:50] * Viktor stands and looks around at everyone.

[23:50] [Nate] Vivian, what do we do now?

[23:50] * Alex snaps his gaze back around to Vivian, jaw working silently,
               though his mouth is closed. He's saved from whatever mistake
               he's about to make by the sound of Nate's voice and then the
               group's arrival.

[23:50] * Vivian looks at Nate with a surly look on her face, as if she's
                 about to insult Alex over something, then stops abruptly
                 and just... stares... at Viktor.

[23:51] [Nate] "Um, this is Viktor."
[23:51] [Nate] "Alex's cousin."

[23:51] * Viktor notices Sabrina and scowls.
[23:51] [Viktor] "Alex... what is this place?"

[23:51] * Nate steps between Viktor and Sabrina

[23:51] * Alex turns and looks Nate and Viktor over. "Viktor." Alex nods,
gives him a tight-lipped, wry smile, and says something in Russian.

[23:51] [Viktor] (more like a disappointed scowl than a mean one)

[23:52] [Nate] (ok)
[23:52] [Nate] (to vivian) "We still need to get more stuff, right?"

[23:52] [Vivian] (Viktor, Vivian is a pale girl with black hair in a bob
                 haircut like a '20's movie star, wearing a vintage jacket.
                 She's probably the prettiest woman you've seen today.)
[23:53] * Vivian smiles thinly at Viktor, then looks over at Nate.  "Um?
                 Right.  Right.  The verbena root."

[23:53] * Viktor looks at everyone trying to make eye contact and smile.

[23:53] * gm **Walter quietly walks over to the table; wordlessly pockets
             the bloody wad of kleenex. He glances over at the quietly
             weeping Sabrina, then take a step or two back into the
             shadows.

[23:53] [Nate] "Did you find out where we can get some of that?"

[23:53] * Vivian peers into the shadows that Walter just ducked into.
                 "Walter knows.  Right, Walter?"

[23:54] [Viktor] "Yes, Alex.. it seems to be crazy here."  (in English)

[23:54] * gm **Walter nods

[23:54] * Alex smirks faintly, shrugs, then just nods, apparently to a
thought in his head, rather than the conversation at hand.

[23:55] * Vivian looks around at the group, then says: "We need to get
                 going.  We need to find this root.  No more fucking
                 around, no more delays."

[23:55] [Nate] "Let's go.  Are we all going together again?"

[23:56] * Vivian nods decisively.  "Yes.  Definitely.  Separation is too
                 much of a risk at this point, I think."

[23:56] * Nate has the keys in his hand

[23:56] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "It only has potency for a couple
             hours."

[23:56] * Alex has taken a subtle half step back and closed his eyes. His
               brow is furrowed in concentration and he is most definitely
               not contributing to any concentration at the moment.

[23:56] [Nate] "We can find the spot where we can dig it up though, right?"

[23:56] [Vivian] "I know, Walter.  But we can't risk not being able to find
                 it in time.  So we need too look for it *now,* to be sure."

[23:57] * Viktor walks over to Alex and whispers "What is going on? I don't
                 understand why you brought me here?"
[23:58] [Viktor] "So Nate, I thought there was some sort of fight? Are we
                 gardening instead?"

[23:58] * Nate turns quickly, looking over his left shoulder.
[23:58] [Nate] "Ssh!  It's here."

[23:59] * Vivian turns quickly from Walter to Nate.  "The specter?"  She
                 looks excited.

[23:59] [Viktor] (oblivious, Viktor smiles at Vivian finally)

[23:59] [Nate] "Yeah, it's here."

[23:59] * gm **Walter frowns, then nods slowly.

[23:59] * Alex turns his head as Viktor approaches, but doesn't react right
               away. After the second question, his puffy, tired eyes pop
               open into a faintly surprised look and he exclaims in an
               exaggerated voice, "Shit. It's you, all right!"

[00:00] [Nate] "Oracle, are we doing this right?  For Sabrina?"

[00:01] * Vivian peers intently into the aether where Nate is focusing his
                 attention.

[00:02] * Viktor whispers to Alex "What the hell? Do I need some weapon or
                 something? You've got me worried."

[00:02] * Nate shakes his head.  "It wants more 'payment'"

[00:02] [Vivian] "What kind of payment?" Vivian says, still peering
                 intently at nothing.

[00:03] [Nate] "Something personal, I think."

[00:03] * Alex grins at Viktor, "Buddy, you're gonna want more than a
               weapon... You're gonna want the first ticket out of this
               shitty town."

[00:03] [Alex] The grin seems a little insane...

[00:04] [Viktor] "No shit! I'm not so sure about this place!"

[00:04] [Vivian] "Something personal of Sabrina's?"

[00:04] [Nate] "Something personal from me, like last time I guess.  I
               don't have anything more like that though.  Oracle, what
               kind of payment do you need?"

[00:04] * Alex shakes his head, "This is one of the few places I'm sure
               of... though right now, it's not as safe as it was." He
               takes a long, deep breath, eyes closed, clearly trying to
               calm himself and focus.

[00:05] * gm **Walter glances at Alex, "You're crashing. I've got something
             that can help."

[00:05] * Alex waves Walter off with a look of mild annoyance, "There isn't
               time just now.  We've got to fill Vik here in..."

[00:06] * Viktor says in a low voice to Alex. "Back east people fucked with
                 you to your face... I don't like this psyco shit."

[00:06] * gm **Walter shrugs.

[00:06] * Vivian prods Nate.  "What's it saying?"

[00:06] [Nate] "Someone's fucking with us to our face.  Look at Sabrina!"
[00:06] [Nate] "It hasn't answered me yet."
[00:07] [Nate] "Do we still have that bowl I burned the picture in?"

[00:07] * Alex laughs softly, "Nate, man... that wasn't to our
               face. Remember, they were trying to get to the rest of you
               through me."

[00:07] * Viktor suprisedly looks at Sabrina.

[00:08] * Nate is visibly tensed, not his usual relaxed smooth self.  

[00:10] [Nate] "Vivian, it says that whoever wants to ask a question has to
               sacrifice something personal."
[00:12] * Nate finds the sacrificial bowl from last time
[00:12] [Nate] "Oracle: will blood do?"

[00:13] * Vivian looks alarmed.  "Careful with blood magic, Nate..."

[00:13] * Viktor *whispers* to Alex, "Are these people straight up?  Are
                 they f'ed up?"
[00:14] * Viktor whispers to Alex, "They're seeing shit... I thought *I* was
                 under some stuff."

[00:14] * Vivian pulls off her crucifix necklace.  "I'll do it.  This
                 crucifix has saved my life more than once -- it's very
                 important to me.  I'll sacrifice it, and ask the
                 question."

[00:15] [Nate] "Ok, put it in the bowl.  Um, I think we need to burn it or
               something."

[00:15] * Viktor crosses himself with a shocked look on his face.

[00:15] * Alex grins at Viktor a little too broadly, "My friend... either
               they're as sane as most people, or I've lost my mind, too."

[00:16] [Nate] "Vivian, I think it'll be happier with your sacrifice"

[00:16] * Alex turns his head around at the word "crucifix" with a puzzled
               look on his face, "Vivian? Crucifix? Huhn?"

[00:16] [Vivian] "Cool.  Ask it if we can just break it, or if we really
                 have to melt it."

[00:17] [Nate] "It has to be destroyed."

[00:17] * Viktor exclaims to Alex, "witchcraft?  is that what this is?
                 Man, I know you were into that goth shit, but seriously"

[00:17] * Vivian turns to Walter.  "Walter?  Do you have any tools that
                 would do the job?  It's silver."

[00:18] * Alex watches Vivian for a second, decides it'd be better not to
               bother her at the moment, and turns back to Viktor,
               "Er... yeah. I mean, no, I'm not into that Goth shit any
               more... but, yes, witchcraft. Sort of."

[00:18] * gm **Walter nods, a hint of sadness on his face, "I have a small
             propane torch."

[00:18] * Vivian nods.  "Get it please."  She looks a bit mournful as she
                 places the crucifix necklace in the sacrificial bowl.

[00:19] * Viktor looks at Alex, "Is there a spell on me? Is that what was
                 fucking me up?"

[00:19] [Nate] (to Vivian) "Make sure you have your question ready.  I'll
               tell you what it answers"

[00:20] * Alex thinks for a moment, shakes his head, then shrugs, looking a
               little sad himself. "No... well... something like
               that. Unfortunately, I think you're one of us, now. I think
               you were supposed to be all along. Like... something was
               just waiting for you too arrive.

[00:20] * gm **Walter walks into the back area, then returns with a small
             handheld torch. As he walks back, he uses the striker in his
             left hand to start it burning. It burns with *whuff*, with
             cold blue flame. walter adjusts it, the half turns, offering
             it to vivian, "Just let go here, and it'll smother."

[00:20] [Viktor] "What the FUCK are you saying?"
[00:21] * Viktor leans back a little wild-eyed.

[00:21] * Vivian looks crossly at Viktor.  "Quiet, please!  There's a
                 ritual in progress."

[00:21] [Viktor] "Alex, I think I need to get out of here!"

[00:21] * gm **Walter stands back, then says quietly, "Viktor isn't part of
             this Vivian -- try and remember that. when you're done,
             explain things to him."

[00:21] * Alex tilts his head, looking undisturbed by Viktor's emotional
               response, "Yeah, that's probably how I looked when I first
               started to believe..." He smiles that wry smile again, then
               snarls at Vivian, "Woman, shut the FUCK up. You didn't take
               it very well when you learned you were imbued either,
               GODDAMNIT!"

[00:22] [Nate] "HEY!"
[00:22] [Nate] "We've got the Oracle thing here now.  It has answers that
               we want."

[00:22] [Alex] (the snarl is both sudden and vicious)

[00:22] [Viktor] "Nobody fucking try anything!"
[00:23] * Viktor looks around wild-eyed and stares at Nate

[00:23] * Vivian looks stunned, and hurt, at Alex.  Then she scowls at him
                 and returns her attention to the bowl.

[00:23] * gm **Walter walks over to viktor, unruffled, "Hey -- wanna beer?
                      Come on -- I've got some in a fridge."

[00:23] * Alex growls faintly under his breath, then turns his attention to
               Sabrina.

[00:23] * Vivian takes a deep breath, carefully aims the torch at the
                 crucifix, and melts the poor thing.

[00:23] * Nate stares at Alex, but slowly turns toward the Oracle

[00:24] * Viktor leans over and grabs Alex.

[00:24] [Alex] "Yeah... Vik... go have a beer.  Have six.  It'll make it
               easier.  Actually, wait, don't have six.  Have... four."

[00:24] [Viktor] "What the FUCK is this Alex?!?"
[00:24] [Viktor] "No tell me NOW!"

[00:25] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "Maybe you should give viktor a
             break and explain what's going on -- it's quieter upstairs."

[00:25] * Viktor is not looking entirely in control..

[00:25] * Alex stares at Viktor with a blank expression, then heaves a
               huge, sighing breath. "Okay... look... just... hold still a
               second. Okay?"

[00:25] * Viktor looks around
[00:25] [Viktor] "Anybody??"

[00:25] * Vivian does her best to focus on the task at hand and ignore the
                 shouting Russians.  Once the crucifix is melted, she turns
                 to Nate.  "Ask it: Will the ritual we are preparing and
                 will undergo at dawn heal Sabrina?  Will it save her
                 life?"

[00:26] [Viktor] "HOld still???  WHy!!??"

[00:26] [Nate] "You can ask.  I'll tell you what it says"
[00:26] [Nate] "He can see you"

[00:26] [Viktor] "So your friends can do something else to make my life
                 miserable?!?"

[00:26] * Vivian turns to where she thinks the spirit is and repeats her
                 question in a calm and clear voice.

[00:26] * Viktor stares at Alex

[00:27] * Alex blinks at Viktor, then starts laughing hysterically,
               "Bahahaha... HA HA HA HA... HA ha ha... heh
               heh... hoooo... dude, whatever they're up to? It's got
               nothin' to do with you."

[00:27] * gm **Sabrina has quieted down, is still sitting where Alex left
             her. She's watching the proceedings, though she's still
             snuffling, with her knees pulled up to her chin.

[00:27] * Viktor steps back from Alex, still wild-eyed..

[00:27] [Alex] (check your windows, people)

[00:28] * Viktor turns and storms away, back the way he came.
[00:28] [Viktor] "Fuck it man... I can't throw down on you.. I gotta get
                 out of here"
[00:29] * Viktor punches a wall on the way out..

[00:30] [Nate] "Yeah, the ritual can do what we want it to do"
[00:31] * Nate glares at Viktor as he leaves.

[00:31] * Vivian closes her eyes and gives a brilliant grin.  "Yes!
                 Yes... oh, thank you."

[00:31] [Nate] "Does she get any more questions?"

[00:32] * Vivian waves at the air.  "Thank you, Oracle!"

[00:32] [Alex] As Viktor turns and begins to walk towards the clearing's
               exit, Alex narrows his eyes, then in a loud and angry voice,
               steps forward, raises his hand, and yells almost
               inarticulately at Viktor's back, making a slashing motion
               with one hand.

[00:34] * Vivian 's mood changes suddenly, and she stares, flabbergasted
                 and appalled, at Alex.

[00:36] [Nate] "I understand.  I'll try to have something ready next time."
[00:37] * Nate looks at Vivian, "just talking to it"

[00:37] * Viktor flails forward as he gets an invisible shove from behind

[00:37] [gm] ( hey -- one sec )

[00:37] * Vivian 's attention is still focused on Alex.  "Mm-hmm," she says
                 absently.

[00:37] [gm] ( we need to sync up some details )

[00:38] [Alex] (check OOC)

[00:46] [Nate] "Alex, why did you have me pick him up again?"

[00:47] * Viktor 's feet skid out from under him and he falls flat on his
                 back.

[00:47] [Nate] "Alex?"

[00:47] * Vivian stares at Alex, then says, more to herself than anyone in
                 particular, "My God.  You're psychokinetic."

[00:48] * Alex snarls softly, hesitates as Vivian speaks, though he keeps
               his eyes locked on Viktor. He then trudges toward his
               cousin, an air of grim determination in every aspect of his
               posture...

[00:48] * Nate quickly moves to face Alex

[00:49] * Vivian snaps back to attention.  She shouts:  "Boys!  This is not
                 the time for a fucking fight!"

[00:49] [Nate] "hey, if you want him to leave, I can take him home right
               now"

[00:49] * Viktor hops to his feet spinning around like he's trying to hit
                 someone not there...

[00:49] * Alex pauses up short in front of Nate, "I'm not going to fight
               him... but this-..." He bites something out in Russian
               "-...dicking around has got to stop. I'm just going to talk
               to him, Nate."

[00:50] * Viktor lets out a pinched growling noise

[00:50] * Nate turns around to Viktor
[00:50] [Nate] "here's the deal.  All that shit about the boogeyman,
               vampires, and fucking monsters?  That's all real."

[00:51] [Viktor] "Aleeexxx??!  What happened to me???!"

[00:51] [Nate] "That's why Sabrina is here with us and not at the hospital.
               They can't help her.  Some dickhead cast a spell on her
               that's doing this.  Vivian knows how to undo it."

[00:51] * gm **Sabrina says quietly, "This is where vivian tells viktor
             about the stuff we saw written on the walls."

[00:51] [Viktor] "Whaaa??"

[00:51] * Alex walks around Nate, looking much calmer, "Vik,
               cousin... buddy... I just knocked you down from ten feet
               away. With my mind... and Nate is right." He walks right up
               to Viktor, looking calm, but very grim.

[00:52] * Viktor 's expression turns from anger to vague fright
[00:52] * Viktor backs away from Alex...
[00:52] [Viktor] "Nooooo...."

[00:52] * Vivian looks at Viktor, and speaks clearly but calmly.  "Viktor.
                 Did you see a message written on a wall?  In Russian?"

[00:53] * Viktor crosses himself 3 more times..

[00:54] * Alex frowns, crouches in front of Viktor, holds his hands up in a
               gesture to show he's disarmed. Otherwise, he lets the others
               talk for a moment.

[00:54] [Viktor] "...a message...?:

[00:54] [Nate] "Look at Sabrina!  This is all real!  Look, you can follow
               us around if you want.  I guess Alex had a reason for me
               picking you up."

[00:55] [Vivian] "Viktor.  I saw the message, SEE THEM.  Nate saw the
                 message, DESTROY THE FEEDERS.  Alex saw a message,
                 STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.  Did you see a message?"  Vivian is
                 speaking very calmly and clearly.

[00:55] * Alex just nods quietly, thoughtfully, at Nate's assertion, says
               quietly, but loud enough for everyone to hear, "I did have a
               reason..." 

[00:55] * Viktor whispers slowly, "...protect....."

[00:56] * Alex blinks, then grins congenially at Viktor. "There you
               go. Welcome to Hell. Welcome to the team..."

[00:56] [Nate] (softly) "I wonder how he's different.."

[00:56] * Viktor looks plaintively at Alex, "Why??"

[00:56] * Vivian smiles at Viktor.  She slowly approaches him, and puts her
                 hand out.  "Viktor, I'm Vivian."  She is very small next
                 to him, and delicate.  "Welcome to the team, indeed.  We
                 can help you, and you can help us.  We just have to stick
                 together."

[00:57] [Nate] "it's more than us.  There's Althea and Lindsey, and
               Hamilton, .."

[00:57] * Alex shakes his head, "I don't know," his accent changes into a
               deliberately awful, comical Russian accent "comrade Viktor"
               then returns to his normal California speak, "none of us
               know why... but you've been... well, you're one of us, now."

[00:58] * Viktor stares at Vivian for awhile, then straightens up and
                 relaxes slightly
[00:58] [Viktor] "..hello.."

[00:58] * Alex looks up at Vivian, grinning wryly, then back down at
               Viktor, "She's insane, but pretty harmless."

[00:58] [Nate] "Harmless? She sets people on fire!"

[00:58] * Vivian , still smiling, says.  "Mm, yeah.  Pretty much."
[00:59] * Vivian whips around to face Nate, and hisses, quietly, "Nate!
                 You are *not* helping!"

[00:59] * Viktor smiles nervously

[00:59] * Vivian shrugs.  "Besides, I can't do that anymore."

[00:59] [Viktor] "Alex! You damn bastard!  You could have told me!!"

[00:59] * Alex eyes Nate, "Dude, she's harmless to -us-! Well... everyone
               but me, at least."

[01:00] * Nate exhales and relaxes slightly.  He walks over to Sabrina and
               sits down near her.
[01:00] [Nate] (to Sabrina) "the Oracle thing says what we're doing will
               help you"

[01:00] * Viktor stumbles nervously forward, glancing around at Nate and
                 Vivian

[01:00] * Alex shrugs at Viktor as he rocks back on his heels, "And, what?
               You'd have believed me? I still don't believe it when I wake
               up, most mornings. I have to... feel... the rest of you
               sorry bastards in my head to remember I'm living in a
               fucking White Wolf role playing game!"

[01:01] [Viktor] "Ha! I would have believed you!"
[01:01] * Viktor says, half to himself, "I must start going to church
                 again.."

[01:01] * Vivian looks around at the group, and claps her hands.  "Shall we
                 get moving?  Into the van?  Viktor, we can fill you in
                 while we're driving.  Okay?"

[01:01] [Nate] "'sorry bastards'  Whatever."

[01:02] * Alex shakes his head, looks up at Vivian, and says quietly,
               expression clouding over, "You'd have been the second."

[01:02] [Nate] "yeah, let's find that plant, so we can dig it up at the
               right time"

[01:02] * gm **Walter nods slowly, says quietly, "Okay. We should make
             proper introductions." Walter steps forward, offers his hand,
             "I'm walter -- I'm the groundskeeper here."

[01:02] * Alex stands up, offers his massive relative his hand to help him
               up, "Sorry for knocking you on your ass... we'll fill you in
               on the ride to wherever the hell we're going..."

[01:03] * Viktor shakes Walter's hand, still nervously, "Hello, you are a
                 quiet one..."

[01:03] * gm **Walter then reluctantly adds, "I'm not one of them. I'm
             not..." he pauses, looking for the right word, then gives up
             lamely finishing with, "...the same"
[01:03] * gm **Walter nods, "Welcome. I'm glad you're here."

[01:03] [Nate] "He's kept his head straight given all the crap he's been
               through with us."

[01:03] * Vivian waves her hand dismissively.  "You didn't see a message,
                 that's all.  You are *so* one of us, Walter."

[01:04] * Viktor grabs Alex's hand and 'playfully' punches him in the arm,
                 "You bastard!"

[01:04] * Alex winces and grunts audibly, a sound Vivian found endearing
               once upon a time. "Yeah... lately." He turns and walks over
               to Sabrina, puts a hand on her shoulder, and crouches next
               to her.

[01:05] [Vivian] "Yeah... lately..." Vivian echoes quietly.

[01:06] [Alex] (could Alex hear that, Doug?)

[01:06] * gm **Sabrina automatically presses her cheek against alex's hand,
             catlike, where it rests on her shoulder.

[01:06] [Vivian] (maybe... make a toughish perception check)

[01:06] * Viktor walks over to Sabrina and crouches in front of her.

[01:06] [Alex] (3x?  1x?)

[01:07] [Vivian] (say 2x, assuming Alex has relatively normal hearing)

[01:07] [Nate] "I'm Nate.  Not much to say about me.  I met most everyone
               here through Sabrina"

[01:07] * gm **Sabrina watches him approach, saying nothing.

[01:07] [Alex] (he does... and barely, barely hears her)

[01:08] * gm **Sabrina says quietly on the heels of nate's words, "He's a
             bad ass. Don't let him fool you." She smiles faintly as she
             says that.

[01:08] [Viktor] "So, you are Sabrina, and they are actually helping you?"

[01:08] * gm sabrina: "They're going to try."

[01:08] * Alex smiles weakly at Viktor as he approaches, "She got stung by
               that glass spider, and that's why she's sick." He pauses,
               "She saved my life."

[01:08] [Viktor] "Yes I have met Nate; he has a 'list'";  Viktors lets out
                 a laugh at this.

[01:09] [Nate] "And that goddamn sorcerer is at the top.  Once Vivian does
               her thing to help Sabrina fight this spell off, I'm calling
               him out." 

[01:10] [Vivian] "You and everyone else in this warehouse."

[01:10] [Nate] "Or seeking him out, or something.  I'm not oging to let him
               make the next move."

[01:10] * gm **Sabrina abruptly clenches up, squinching her eyes shut, a
             second passes as she starts to shake, finally making a
             strangled noise in the back of her throat.

[01:11] * Nate quickly scans the room
[01:11] [Nate] "How much time until sunrise?"

[01:11] [gm] ( it's about 1am in game -- so about five or six hours )

[01:12] [Vivian] (I think it's later than that -- wasn't it around 1am when
                 they arrived at the warehouse?)

[01:12] [Viktor] "Hey, is she getting sick?"

[01:12] * Nate bites his lip.  "Wish there was something we could do until
               then."
[01:12] [Nate] "Alex, are we still safe here?"

[01:12] [gm] ( nah, I think ya'll arrived back at the warehouse around
             midnight, then viktor arrived about 20 monutes later. )

[01:13] * Vivian looks sternly at Nate.  "There is, Nate.  We're going to
                 look for the verbena root, and we're going to find it.
                 Now."

[01:13] [Nate] "I have an extra blanket in the van for Sabrina.  Let's get
               going."

[01:13] * Alex rocks back on his heels like before, closes his eyes, and
               focuses for a moment.

[01:15] * gm **Sabrina slowly unclenches, pants for a second before letting
             her beathing go shallow again.

[01:15] * Alex heaves a huge sigh, pops his eyes open, "Okay... everyone,
               including Viktor, is in slight danger. Sabrina, as usual, is
               worse. We don't need to turn, but we should get on the move
               as soon as possible." He stops, then mumbles very quietly,
               "And I was looking forward to that nap..."

[01:16] [Nate] "Rest in the van"

[01:16] [Vivian] "If we find the root right away, we can make a note of
                 where we found it, then come back and grab some shuteye."

[01:17] [Vivian] "But only if we find it right away."

[01:17] * gm **Walter looks over at alex, "Patience. Growing in the
             marsh. Chew it, and you'll feel better. For a little while."

[01:17] [Alex] "Yes.  Shuteye.  Please."  He sounds a touch desperate.

[01:17] [Nate] "do we have any ideas where to look?"

[01:17] * Alex eyes Walter, "Er... what's it look like? It won't make me
               crash after, will it?"

[01:18] * gm **Walter looks at nate, clearly puzzled, "Yeah. You can look
                      in the marsh part of the garden."

[01:18] * gm He then looks over at alex, "It's pretty rough when you start
             coming down, but it works for awhile."

[01:18] [Nate] "You have the stuff growing here??"
[01:18] [Nate] "The plant that Vivian needs?"

[01:18] * Vivian frowns.  "Walter..."  She looks at Nate.  "The stuff in
the garden won't work.  We need the wild type."

[01:19] [Alex] "How long is a while?  I need to be up until this thing gets
               done."
[01:19] [Alex] "...once I take it, anyways."

[01:19] * gm **Walter looks at nate, clearly confused, then nods, "Oh --
             Patience in the garden marsh. I have some verbena root, but I
             don't think grows here will work -- only as a very last
             resort."

[01:20] [Nate] "Ok, Vivian, do you know where we can find the kind that you
               need?"

[01:20] [Vivian] "Walter knows."

[01:20] * gm **Walter looks at nate, nods, "Probably, yeah."

[01:20] * Alex shakes his head violently, "Ugh. I'm gonna go grab some of
               this Patience crap. I'll meet you guys by the exit..."

[01:21] * Vivian smiles a mirthless schoolteacher smile.  "Boys -- in the
                 van -- *now.*  No more chit-chat.  Please?"

[01:21] * Alex rolls his eyes, turns, and trots off to find some
               Patience... eventually makes his way to the entrance... (at
               GM's arbitration)

[01:22] [gm] [ alex, as you leave, sabrina sits forward looking very
             intense ]

[01:23] * Nate starts up the van
[01:23] [Nate] "It'll be a bit crowded in here, but we should all fit"

[01:23] * Vivian walks over to stand next to Sabrina.  "Sweetie, do you
                 need help to get to the van?"

[01:24] [gm] ( whoa, nate, no teleporting )

[01:24] [Nate] (doh!)

[01:24] [Alex] (heh heh heh)

[01:24] * Nate pulls his keys out of his pocket

[01:24] * Viktor looks at Vivian, "Will she walk, or will she get carried?"

[01:24] * gm **Sabrina sits forward as alex starts to go, "People? I
             have...I have a question."

[01:24] * Vivian nods.  "Sure.  What is it?"

[01:24] * gm **Sabrina glares at Viktor, "I can still walk."

[01:25] [Viktor] ( :) )

[01:25] * Nate pauses, turning to face Sabrina

[01:26] * gm **Sabrina hesitates, shivers violently, "What if the ritual
             fails?"

[01:26] * Nate looks down, unable to face Sabrina.

[01:26] * gm **Walter frowns, glances at alex, then vivian.

[01:26] * Vivian looks at Sabrina, and says, as confidently as possible,
                 "It won't."

[01:26] [Nate] "The Oracle said we're doing the right thing."

[01:27] * gm **Sabrina looks at nate, "No. It didn't. Not exactly."

[01:27] * Alex half-misses a step... then keeps right on walking out of the
               clearing.

[01:27] [Nate] "We still need to do it right, but the ritual can help you."

[01:28] * Viktor stares quizzically after Alex...

[01:28] * Vivian furrows her brow.  "Sabrina, it said the ritual will do
                 what we want it to do.  And we want it to heal you."

[01:28] * gm **Sabrina frowns after alex, but continues speaking, "But if
                       it doesn't?  If it fails?"

[01:30] [Nate] "I..don't know.  We need to focus on making sure we do the
               ritual right."

[01:30] * gm **Sabrina leans back, her eyes welling up again, her tears
             stained a faint pink, "If you're so confident it's going to
             work then this is all moot. But if it fails...guys...[she
             pauses, closing her eyes]...just walk away."

[01:30] [Nate] "If things don't turn out like we expect them to, we'll have
               to figure something else out. "

[01:30] [Viktor] "This ritual, is it... like faith?"

[01:30] [Nate] "the Oracle gave us the hint that let us find this ritual in
               the first place"

[01:31] * Vivian puts her hand on Sabrina's shoulder and grips it firmly.
                 "It won't fail.  I won't let it."  Her voice grows a
                 little hoarse with emotion.  "I promise you.  I won't let
                 it fail."

[01:31] [Nate] "Vivian can tell you all about it. "

[01:31] * gm **Sabrina turns her head, "No. Just leave me there. I've been
             a magnet for things that can hurt you. If the ritual
             fails...." she shakes her head

[01:31] [Nate] "You saved us on the boat.  All of us."

[01:32] * gm **Sabrina: "Then there's no point protecting me." Sabrina looks
             sharply up at nate, "So? Dying with me won't help."

[01:32] * Vivian leans close to Sabrina, and her voice gets steely.  "Don't
                 *ever* say that again.  We will *not* leave you.  Not now,
                 not ever.  I promised you that.  And I always keep my
                 fucking promises.  Always."

[01:33] * gm **Sabrina looks over at vivian, "If it fails, I want you
             people to promise to just walk away. [she pauses] Promise or
             I'll fight you every step of the way."

[01:33] [Nate] "Vivian can undo the spell. "

[01:34] * Vivian locks eyes with Sabrina.  "Then you'll have to fight me
                 every step of the way."

[01:34] [Nate] "You need our help to get through this, Sabrina"

[01:34] * gm **Sabrina looks up at vivian, "Okay."

[01:35] * Vivian stands up straight.  "Okay.  Nate, move to the other side
of Sabrina.  Let's go to the van, now."

[01:36] * Nate moves to the other side of Sabrina.

[01:36] * gm **Walter sighs, "Hey, calm down."

[01:36] [Viktor] "Heh perhaps we will all fight you..."

[01:37] * gm **Walter: "No one's fighting anybody."

[01:37] [Nate] "Sabrina, we have almost all of the things we need for the
               ritual.  All we need is the plant."

[01:37] [Nate] "Vivian will do the ritual for you, and you'll be strong
               again."

[01:38] [Viktor] "Yes it does seem odd."

[01:38] [Vivian] "Sabrina, will you walk with us to the van?  Please?"

[01:38] * gm **Walter glares at vivian, then at nate, "If we're confident
             this is going to work, then it's moot. Okay, sabrina. I'll
             promise. Because we have nothing to worry about."
[01:39] * gm **Walter looks at vivian pointedly, "Right vivian?"
[01:39] * gm **Walter frowns, reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cell
             phone, "Alex?"

[01:39] [Alex] (sorry, guys, this definitely requires a quick ninja note)

[01:40] * Nate looks sadly at Sabrina. "Ok, I'll promise then too."

[01:40] * Viktor shakes his head, "And I am the Russian among us..."

[01:40] * Vivian doesn't look at Walter.  "Please come with us."  There is
no hint of irony in her voice.  "Please."

[01:40] * gm **Sabrina shakes her head, her voice strained with emotion, "I
             don't want anyone dying for me. It's..."

[01:41] * Viktor looks around, "Oh, you want us to die for other reasons?
                 Plainly this is good reason to die"

[01:41] * gm **Walter 's brow furrows, then he turns to everyone, "Wait.",
             speaking on the phone, he says quietly, "Yes."

[01:42] * gm walter, "Okay."

[01:42] * gm **Sabrina fixes viktor with an intent stare, "Some things
             aren't worth dying for. [her voice cracks] They just aren't."

[01:42] * Nate looks at Walter

[01:43] * Vivian still has her gaze fixed on Sabrina.  "No one's going to
                 die.  Please, Sabrina."

[01:43] * gm **Walter frowns at nate, shakes his head a little bit, says
             "Yeah" into the phone.

[01:44] * Viktor looks back at Sabrina and laughs, "Yes of course -- some
                 things aren't. What makes you so sure this is one of them?"
[01:45] [Viktor] "I have seen people die for a patch of concrete, for a
                 tiny wad of cash, for many things you or I would not
                 value....."

[01:45] * gm **Walter sighs, says, "I'll bring it. I hopefully we won't
             need it. We're walking her to the van now. Oh, the patience --
             it's a big leathery leaf like tobacco only reddish and
             brown. can't miss it."

[01:46] * Viktor scoffs, "The life of a family member, of a friend..."

[01:46] * gm **Sabrina looks at viktor, smiles sardionically, speaks in
          russian.

[01:47] * Viktor scoffs again and walks away.

[01:47] * Nate looks around

[01:47] [Nate] "Are you going to come with us then?"

[01:47] * gm **Walter nods, "Okay. see you at the van."

[01:47] * gm **Sabrina laughs, "Fuck you nate. You know I don't have a
             choice."

[01:47] [Viktor] "Hey Alex you never said she spoke Russian!!"

[01:48] * gm **Sabrina: "Okay. I've got walter's and nate's promise. that's
             good enough."

[01:48] * gm **Walter says into the phone, "We're leaving. gotta go."
[01:49] * gm **Walter then hangs up, heads into his workshop, saying over
             his shoulder, "I'll catch up."

[01:49] * Nate looks sadly at Sabrina again, and turns to walk toward the
               exit to the van.

[01:49] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[01:49] [Nate] (ok)

[01:49] * Vivian stays to make sure Sabrina is coming.

[01:49] [Viktor] "Alex!!! I see why your friends need me!!!"

[01:50] [Alex] (Alex is currently away.  Does Vik yell this?)

[01:51] [Viktor] (yes... he thinks alex is within earshot, and is walking
                 that way anyway)

[01:51] * gm **Sabrina hesitates, glances down at Vivian's pipe with a
             faint smile, then forces herself to stand, "Sitting hurt more
             anyway" she grumbles.

[01:51] [Alex] (Heh, Alex probably hears.)

[01:52] * Vivian returns the faint smile, then follows Sabrina's gaze to
                 the pipe.  "Take a quick toke," she says, quietly.  "It'll
                 help your stomach, honest."

[01:52] [gm] and that is where we'll stop

[22:23] [gm] [ okay, so in the last episode, we have introduced Viktor, and
             prepared to take jaunt up into the hills to search out some
             verbena root at approx 1am on a sunday morning (with sunrise
             at approx 0630 on the beach -- maybe a little but
             later). Walter and gone into a back rooms to get his machete,
             vivian and sabrina were at the glass table at point 2, alex
             was in the swampy area, where were nate and viktor? ]

[22:24] [Vivian] (Nate was heading to the van, keys in hand.)

[22:28] [gm] ( okay, I'm going to break this down a little bit, and do it
             in serial. bear with me -- I'll let y'all go in a moment. )

[22:28] [Alex] (As long as I get to do my little bit of flavor text)

[22:29] [gm] [ vivian, you and sabrina were by the table, with Sabrina
             standing, complaining about how sitting was hurting more
             anyhow. as she stood, she glanced down at the pipe and smiled
             faintly. Vivian offered her a toke before they left. ]

[22:30] * Vivian is still holding out the pipe and lighter and smiling
                 hopefully at Sabrina.

[22:30] [Alex] (this is after the conversation about Sabrina being left
               behind, right?)

[22:30] [Vivian] (yes)

[22:30] * gm **Sabrina looks up at vivian, for a second, frowns, then
             shakes her head slowly, "I'm already coughing up my left lung
             in little bits. I'm not sure that would be such a good thing."
             She pauses, then looks up at Vivian, "I don't deserve
             this...why is everyone being so...nice?"

[22:32] [Vivian] "You're our friend.  You're one of us."

[22:33] * gm **Sabrina snorts, shakes her head, "It doesn't...." She
             pauses, about to say more, then shakes her head again, "I
             guess we should go."

[22:34] [Viktor] (Viktor is walking ahead to the van)

[22:34] [gm] ( ah. okay. )

[22:34] * Vivian nods.  "Definitely."  She doesn't immediately grab hold of
                 Sabrina, but stays near and quickly helps her along if she
                 needs it.

[22:35] * gm **Sabrina , looking troubled, turns and walks toward the door,
             pausing to rest often....
[22:36] [gm] [ Alex, you can hear the rustling of heavy footsteps and see
             the movement of foliage as VIktor approaches ]

[22:36] * Vivian walks next to Sabrina, heading towards the van.  She keeps
                 her hands in her pockets unless Sabrina stumbles or needs
                 a hand.

[22:36] [gm] ( Vivian: okay. )
[22:37] [gm] [ momentarily transfers things to alex and viktor. ]

[22:37] [Viktor] Alex! Where to now?

[22:40] [Alex] As the group approaches the exit, they all, one after
               another, eventually realize that they can hear the sound of
               a surprisingly good voice singing.  By the time they've
               reached the door, they've all realized that it's Alex
               crooning the following song:
               http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/strungout/hernameinblood.html
[22:40] [Alex] (the original is a punk/metal/power pop hybrid...)
[22:41] [Alex] When each of them sees him in turn, he's looking off into
               space, tired and distracted, unaware of their arrival...

[22:42] [gm] [ Viktor arrives first, then a few moments later, sabrina and
             vivian, followed not much later by walter. presumably nate is
             out in the van, warming it up. ]
[22:43] [gm] [ unless viktor and alex engage in any further conversation,
             vivian and sabrina stroll up a moment or two later, sabrina
             looking pained, pale, and distracted. ]

[22:43] [Viktor] Wow the man can sing!  Who knew

[22:44] * Vivian is walking slowly to keep pace with Sabrina.  When she
                 comes to where Alex is, she is *staring* at him.

[22:45] * Alex cuts off in mid line, turning his head to stare back at the
               interlopers in his exhausted reverie. He blinks once,
               flashes a grin, then resumes singing until he reaches the
               end of the song.

[22:45] * gm **Sabrina stops, reaches out to a tree and leans against
             it. After she stands, head down for a second, she looks up, a
             hint of a smile briefly playing about her lips before being
             driven away with a shudder.
[22:46] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[22:47] * Viktor smiles and claps.

[22:47] * Alex straightens away from the wall, reaches up to scratch the
               back of his neck, then just shrugs, smiling a faint smile
               that mimics Sabrina's.

[22:47] * Vivian is trying to frown at Alex, and almost succeeds.  "Strung
                 Out, huh.  Good song.  Um... since when can you sing?"

[22:48] * Alex arches an eyebrow at her, lips quivering while he tries very
               unsuccessfully to suppress a grin, "Ehh. I guess I just
               started recently. Since when do you listen to Strung Out?"

[22:49] * Viktor gives a lopsided grin and says "I can see him now, down at
                 amateur night. 'Alex the Brooding'."

[22:50] * Vivian glares at Alex.  "My tastes have always been eclectic.
                 Since when did you start listening to decent music again?"

[22:51] * Alex glances between Vivian and Viktor, eyes narrowed
               slightly... and then he grunts unceremoniously, followed
               immediately by a massive, jaw-cracking yawn, "So, uh... we
               goin', or are you all just gonna stand there gawking at the
               next American Idol?"

[22:51] * gm **Walter comes striding up to the entrance, a little bit
             behind everyone else, carrying his machete in its cloth
             sheath, still dressed in a white tshirt and jeans (and looking
             like he's been doing yardwork recently)

[22:51] * Viktor guffaws.

[22:52] * gm **Walter stops, quickly glances around at everyone, "Change in
             plans, I think."

[22:52] * Vivian snorts.  "Yeah, right.  I wonder how many new orifices
                 Simon would tear you?"

[22:52] [Viktor] "Serenading and gardening..." Viktor snorts, "Alex I don't
                 know if I can hang with your people.."

[22:52] * Vivian looks abrubtly serious.  "What is it, Walter?"

[22:52] [gm] "I don't think it makes any sense for all of us to go tramping
             out in the hills at this hour."

[22:53] * Vivian furrows her brow.  "Why not?"

[22:53] * gm **Walter nods toward the crack in the concrete wall leading
             out into the windy darkness, "I'll take nate and Big Red and
             we'll head for the hills, find this root. You guys stay here."

[22:53] * Alex is in the middle of snorting at Viktor and Vivian -again-
               when Walter arrives. He cuts off, all mirth leaving his body
               language.

[22:54] * gm **Walter looks at alex, "When things get too hot [walter
             shrugs] take the van for a spin."
[22:54] [gm] "That make sense?"

[22:55] * Alex shrugs, nods, "Yeah... wish I had my car. More
               reliable. Handles better. But I'll make do. Again."

[22:55] * gm **Walter shrugs, "IF you want to take the van to estate and
             get your car, whatever. I need to get the keys from nate, and
             I dopn

[22:56] [Vivian] "Are you and Nate going to explain to Viktor about all the
                 preternatural manifestations we've encountered?  If not,
                 he should stay with us."

[22:56] * gm **Walter ..."and I don't want to waste time. Walk with me
             Alex?"

[22:56] [Viktor] "Handles better?  Are we running from the cops?  Again?",
                 Viktor grins at Alex...

[22:57] * Alex eyes Vivian, "He stays with us, period. Rather, he stays
               with me." He turns toward Walter, frowning slightly, then
               nods, "Yeah... wait here, everyone."

[22:57] * gm **Walter glances at vivian, shaking his head, "I'd rather have
             nate with me if I'm going to be running around in the hills
             after dark. at least that way, I'll know if something is going
             to attack us." Walter looks pointed at alex, then looks back
             at vivian.

[22:57] * Alex flashes a wry grin at Viktor and his cop comment.

[22:58] * Vivian turns to Viktor.  "Oh, ho!  What sordid adventures have
                 you and Alex been on together?"

[22:58] * gm **Walter looks confused for a second, "Oh...yeah...viktor
             should stay here."

[22:58] [Viktor] "Yeeesss, leave Viktor here with the womenfolk. Its only
                 right."

[22:59] [Vivian] "Would you rather be alone in the woods with only other
                 boys for company?"  Vivian arches an eyebrow.

[22:59] * gm **Walter nods at vivian, looks at alex, "C'mon. Time's short."

[22:59] * Viktor gives Sabrina and Vivian a somewhat excessive grin.

[22:59] * Alex nods, walks over to Walter and passed him, heading out of
               the clearing.

[23:01] * Vivian folds her arms, glances at Sabrina to make sure she's
                 okay, then turns to Viktor.  "So... any embarrassing
                 family secrets about Alex you want to share?"

[23:01] [Alex] (ARGH!)

[23:01] [gm] ( oh ouch. that's so not cool. )

[23:02] * Vivian pulls a cigarette from a silver case, lights it, takes a
                 drag, and grins at Viktor.

[23:02] [Viktor] "Why, of course!  Do you know that he was a bedwetter
                 until he was 12?  Yes... its true!"

[23:02] * Vivian giggles.  "Oh, that totally makes sense.  What else?"  She
                 proffers her cigarette case to Viktor.  "Want a smoke?"

[23:03] * Viktor takes a cigarette with a nod.

[23:03] * Vivian also offers the cigarettes to Sabrina.

[23:03] [Viktor] "Oh, there is much more, but ever since I could beat the
                 tar out of him, I try not to be toooo mean..."

[23:03] * Vivian lights Viktor's cigarette with her Calibri lighter with
                 her free hand.
[23:04] [Vivian] "You do know it's impossible to be too mean to Alex,
                 right?"

[23:04] [Viktor] "Oh, just one more thing", Viktor takes a drag, "he will
                 scream like a girl if you surprise him. You heard his
                 voice, no?"

[23:05] * Vivian chuckles.  "You should have seen us in 9th grade.  We did
                 the Goth thing together.  You put black lipstick and
                 fishnets on him, and he *looks* like a girl, too."

[23:06] * Viktor guffaws, "Alex is *hot*!"

[23:06] * Vivian laughs.  " _Was_ hot.  But, yeah."
[23:08] * Vivian takes a thoughtful drag from her cigarette.  "Seriously,
                 though, Viktor, we should probably talk 'shop.'  Have you
                 manifested any metahuman abilities yet?"

[23:08] [Viktor] "Manifestah metawhat.....?", Viktors looks a little too
                 dumbfounded.

[23:09] [Vivian] "Well, all of us who saw the messages -- those of us who
                 Alex calls 'imbued' - have shown some superhuman ability,
                 or abilities.  Have you been able to do
                 anything... *unusual* recently?"

[23:10] [Viktor] "Unusual? You have seen me, no?"
[23:11] [Viktor] "I've been trying to stay good for awhile.  Things get a
                 little crazy for me sometimes..."

[23:11] * Vivian giggles.  "I love the way you look, actually.  You're such
                 an archetype -- the classic Russian 'bear.'"
[23:12] [Vivian] "But, seriously.  What do you mean by 'get a little
                 crazy'?"

[23:12] * Viktor gives another guffaw. "Well, I used to shave myself when I
                 wanted to wrestle... but I guess I'm getting like a bear
                 these days." 
[23:13] [Viktor] "Well I try to be good, you know?  But always my friends
                 start needing my help, and I am always able to bash heads,
                 you know?" 
[23:14] [Viktor] "So I try to help them but it will get me into trouble
                 usually..."

[23:15] * Vivian starts gesturing with her cigarette as she speaks.  "Let
                 me give you some examples of what I'm getting at.  I'm a
                 mage, or a 'witch' -- I can cast arcane spells.  Alex has
                 various telepathic/telekinetic abilities.  Nate can focus
                 his 'chi' to do preternatural fighting moves.  Sabrina is
                 precognitive.  Et cetera."  She punctuates this last with
                 her cigarette, as if *that* should explain it.

[23:15] [Viktor] "I don't turn my back on my friends! But it will lead to
                 trouble... so just awhile ago I come across the country to
                 stay here and be with Alex's family. They are very good to
                 me."
[23:16] [Viktor] "Some of my friends are very good gamblers. I'm not so
                 good..."
[23:17] [Viktor] "Oh yes, Alex told me Nate knows the martial arts good."

[23:17] * Vivian raises an eyebrow again, looking nonplused.  "Um, yeah."

[23:18] [Viktor] "We will have to spar sometime", Viktor makes some
                 sparring moves...

[23:18] * gm **Sabrina takes a step back, still leaning against the tree.

[23:18] [Viktor] "So wait, are you saying Alex can read minds?"

[23:19] * Vivian throws her hands up defensively.  "Eek!  I hope you mean
                 you want to spar with Nate, not me?"  Then she looks
                 serious.  "Not quite... but he can read emotional states."

[23:19] [Viktor] "He has, what, esp?"
[23:19] * Viktor smiles, "No worries! Its only sparring anyway."
[23:20] [Viktor] "Emotional states?   What, can't everyone?", Viktor
                 guffaws again.

[23:20] * Vivian grins nervously and takes a couple of mincing steps
                 backwards, away from Viktor.  "Sure, everyone can -- to a
                 point.  But Alex, if he tries, can do it perfectly.  It's
                 -- amazing, but kind of creepy, to be honest."

[23:20] * Viktor smiles, then frowns, then looks crazed.
[23:21] [Viktor] "Really? Thats pretty cool!"
[23:21] [Viktor] "So what can you do again?"
[23:21] [Viktor] "You are a witch?  How can that be?

[23:22] * Vivian smiles proudly.  "I can cast spells.  From books of
                 'forgotten lore.'  It's my spell that will heal Sabrina --
                 or, at least, I'll be the one casting it."

[23:22] [Viktor] "Won't God strike you down..??"

[23:23] * Vivian looks startled, then slightly hurt.  "What?  Oh, no,
                 no... it's nothing blasphemous, or sacrilegeous, honest."

[23:23] [Viktor] "Really?", Viktor looks quizzical.
[23:24] [Viktor] "I don't think I understand *ANY* of this...."
[23:24] * Viktor looks at Sabrina, "Is this true..?  She will *heal* you?"

[23:25] * gm **Sabrina , head bowed, nods without looking up, "She's going
             to try."

[23:25] [Alex] It's about now that Alex returns from outside.  His cheeks
               and nose are windburned and flushed, the rest of his face is
               pale and haggard looking.  He takes a few steps in, then
               just stands there, watching the others without interrupting.

[23:26] [Viktor] "So, I'm guessing no doctor will help?", Viktor looks
                 genuine.

[23:26] [Alex] (he's not trying to be sneaky)

[23:26] * Vivian nods to Viktor and Sabrina, firmly.  "No.  But I *will*
                 heal her."

[23:26] [Viktor] (is he in our sight?)

[23:26] [Alex] (he is)

[23:27] * gm **Sabrina shakes her head, looking up with a bitter smile
             twisting her lips, "A doctor probably won't be able to help." 

[23:27] [Viktor] "Alex?  You look drunk? What have you done?"

[23:27] * Vivian notices Alex.  "Oh.  Hey.  It's you."  Her brows knit.
                 "You know, you look like shit."

[23:28] * gm **Sabrina speaks to alex in spanish briefly.

[23:28] * Alex studies Sabrina for a moment, failing to respond to Vik or
               Viv for a few seconds... and then he frowns at them both,
               "No, I'm not drunk. Why?"
[23:29] * Alex gives Sabrina an odd look, scowls, then blinks in
               realization, scowls at Vik and Viv again, then respons in
               Spanish. 

[23:30] [Viktor] "He is an angry drunk, no?" Viktor says to Vivian.

[23:30] * gm **Sabrina shrugs uncomfortably, then smiles weakly.

[23:30] * Vivian watches the Spanish interaction, then says to Alex,
                 "You've been looking increasingly haggard.  No --
                 drained."  Her eyes narrow.  "Are you okay?"

[23:31] * Alex straightens and squares his (rather broad) shoulders again,
               "Yeah. A little tired. I'm okay. I could just use a little
               rest, I guess."

[23:32] * Vivian whispers to Viktor, "More like melodramatic and
                 self-pitying."  Then, loudly, "All right... if you're
                 sure." 

[23:33] * gm **Sabrina , still leaning against a tree, says quietly in a
             hesitant, fainting little whisper, "guys? I don't think I can
             stand here much longer" then begins to sway a little bit,
             still leaning heavily against the tree.

[23:33] * Alex nods, waves his hands at Vivian vaguely, then, to Viktor, "I
               don't know what lies she's been telling you, but don't
               believe a word she's said. About anything."

[23:33] * Viktor starts to lean forward to catch Sabrina

[23:33] [Alex] It's hard to tell if Alex is kidding or not.

[23:33] * Vivian rushes over to Sabrina as well.
[23:34] [Vivian] "We're just waiting for Walter and Nate to get back --
                 let's go back inside and sit down."

[23:34] * gm **Sabrina smiles apologetically, "I'm sorry."

[23:34] [Viktor] "No no, Alex she's been telling me the truth! I'm sure of
                 it...."

[23:36] *** Alex has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[23:36] [gm] [ alex slump against a tree, his face going slack and
             expressionless before blowing apart like dust in the wind ]

[23:37] * gm **Sabrina shrieks, "ALEX!!!"

[23:37] [Viktor] "Good God!!!"

[23:37] *** Alex has joined #dblf

[23:38] [gm] [ alex drops out of a black hole that opens up, depositing
             him exactly where he was standing.... ]

[23:40] * Vivian grins, showing teeth.  To Viktor: "The gospel truth."  To
                 Sabrina: "Come on, sweetie, let's get you back inside."
                 Vivian starts leading Sabrina back to the chairs where
                 they were sitting earlier, unless she resists.

[23:41] * gm **Sabrina nods gratefully, still lookin apologetic as the
             group starts to head back to point 2 (which is in the interior
             of the warehouse, btw -- not the roof)

[23:43] * Vivian turns to Alex as they're walking.  "So, what did you and
                 the mysterious Mister Walks-with-Tears do out there,
                 alone, in the woods?"

[23:44] * Viktor offers to help Sabrina along.

[23:44] * Alex is shuffling along behind them, weaving just slightly as he
               walks, as if he -was- drunk. When Vivian speaks, Alex jerks
               his head up, blinks, "Huh? Oh. Tactics."  He frowns,
               "Contingencies and stuff, in case things start getting hairy
               here.  And, y'know... girl talk."

[23:45] [Vivian] "Ohh...  Were you telling Walter about how you were
                 feeling -- y'know -- not so fresh?"

[23:46] * gm **Sabrina snorts with laughter

[23:46] [Viktor] "You are all speaking as if things would be 'hairy', but
                 really, what could it be...?"

[23:47] * Vivian shakes her head.  "With this group, Viktor?  The better
                 question is:  what *couldn't* it be.  It could be
                 *anything.*"

[23:47] [Alex] "It could be nice for a change and just leave us alone until
               after we complete the ritual?"
[23:47] [Alex] "Real, real... real... nice..."

[23:48] [Viktor] "Alex, if you are drinking, you must share!"

[23:48] * Alex then suddenly continues, apropos of nothing, "I ought to go
               dig up my old X-men comics." and more faintly, definitely to
               himself, "...I think they're in the spare room..."
[23:49] [Alex] "Cousin, buddy, if I was hittin' the bottle, you'd be the
               first I'd share it with."  He pauses a moment, then, "And
               the last, as usual."

[23:49] * Vivian frowns at Alex.  "Yeah.  Try to find the story arc where
                 Wolverine and Shadowcat take on the Unseelie Court of the
                 Fey."  She shakes her head.  "Seriously, Alex, what's up?"

[23:49] * Viktor chucks Alex on the shoulder, "Alex! We would be good
                 drinking buddies!"

[23:50] * Alex blinks at Vivian stupidly, "The take on the what? They never
               did that!"
[23:50] * Alex winces a little at the blow, then grins at Vik, [Russian]
               "Yeah, ya damn straight!"
[23:51] [Alex] "Nothin', Viv.  Just distracted."

[23:52] [Vivian] "Uh huh.  Right.  And where the hell did you learn to
                 sing, anyway?  I honestly want to know."

[23:52] [gm] [ moments later, the group arrives back at the glass table,
             settling in. ]

[23:54] * gm **Sabrina speaks in spanish to alex again, the word "diablo"
             figuring prominently

[23:55] * Vivian , quietly to Viktor:  "Do you speak Spanish too, or just
                 Russian and English?"

[23:55] [Viktor] "No, no spanish"

[23:56] * Alex doesn't respond to either of them immediately, taking his
               time about settling into a chair at the table and leaning
               back in his chair. He rubs his eyes with the backs of his
               hands, then his nose, a sign Vivian recognizes from their
               dating days. He used to do that when he was really tired as
               a teen. It was one of his few boyish gestures.
[23:56] * Alex then responds to Sabrina in Spanish.

[23:57] * Vivian whispers to Viktor: "I think something's really wrong with
                 Alex.  Keep an eye on him, okay?"  The look in her eyes is
                 one of concern.

[23:57] * gm **Sabrina chuckles weakly, then pauses, clenching up, making a
             little noise in the back of her throat.

[23:58] * Viktor whispers to Vivian, "So, not drunk, then what?"

[23:58] * Vivian (whispering) "I don't know.  I think it has something to
                 do with his powers, but I'm not sure."
[23:59] * Vivian (loudly, to the group) "Sabrina?  You want a glass of
                 water or something?"

[00:00] * gm **Sabrina nods weakly, "My mouth tastes like..."

[00:01] * Vivian nods, and briskly goes through Walter's "kitchen" area
                 until she comes back with a glass or cup of water for
                 Sabrina.

[00:01] [Alex] pause

[00:03] * gm **Sabrina looks around as vivian gets back, "You guys should
             be resting. [she grins] I can keep watch.  I'm not all that
             sleepy anyhow."

[00:04] * Vivian hands Sabrina the water.  "You know, that's a pretty good
                 idea.  I think I'll take you up on it."

[00:04] [Viktor] "Hmm... I am not tired. It seems that Alex is though."

[00:05] * Vivian stifles a yawn, then stands, arms folded, staring at the
                 sleeping Alex.  "Yeah.  Yeah."

[00:07] * Viktor gives Sabrina a slightly unsettling smile.

[00:07] * Vivian shakes her head, and then says to Sabrina, "I'm going to
                 the 'bullet room' to grab a few Z's.  Wake me up as soon
                 as the boys get back, or if you need anything, 'kay?"

[00:07] * Alex looks mildly comical, his face buried so hard into his arm
               that it's pushing the skin of his cheeks and around his eyes
               up into folds. 
[00:08] * Alex also twitches slightly at random intervals, something that
               definitely does -not- normally happen when he sleeps.

[00:09] * Vivian waves to Sabrina and Viktor, stares at Alex one last time,
                 then heads into another room.

[00:14] [gm] [ gm fastfowards unless there are any complaints? ]

[00:14] [Vivian] (go for it)

[00:14] [Viktor] (ff away)

[00:14] [gm] [ alex, vivian -- your nap lasts about 3 hours unless
             something intervenes (which actually seems kind of likely). ]

[00:15] [Vivian] (given Vivian's relationship to sleep, I can see her
                 passed out for all 3)

[00:16] [gm] [ viktor, you and sabrina are settled in at the table where
             sabrina starts to fitfully doze, though her sleeps are short
             and she awakens repeatedly, most often right after clenching
             up in her sleep ]
[00:17] [gm] as time passes, her strangled little noises graduate to
             groans, to teeth clenching whimpers

[00:17] [Viktor] (she snores oddly)

[00:17] [gm] [ by the time 0400 rolls around, she's not sleeping anymore ]

[00:18] [Alex] (let me know if something particularly loud or intrusive
               affects Alex while he's unconscious)

[00:18] [Viktor] (nightmares...)

[00:19] [Alex] (heh, probably not... he's too tired)

[00:19] [Viktor] (soo.... she's  not sleeping,   what is she doing?)

[00:20] [gm] [ I'll say that the 3 hours of sleep, aren't quite enough to
             work off the normal daily dose of fatigue, inflicting, say 3
             consciousness. ]

[00:20] [Vivian] (noted)

[00:21] [Alex] (still above half! ...barely)
[00:21] [Alex] (um... I'm dumb.  I've been taking a 2x hit.  I'm still at
               only 1x.  3 successes on that singing roll!)

[00:21] [gm] [ she's sitting her in her chair, knees pulled up to her
             chest, muffling herself in the sleeve of her jacket. by 4,
             she's pretty much alternately whimpering and stifling screams
             with her face pressed up into the crook of her elbow ]

[00:24] * Alex begins to make some of his own noises shortly after Sabrina
               starts the muffled screaming, only coming truly awake over
               the course of about 15 minutes...

[00:24] [gm] [ vivian, you're having a dream about not waking up in time
             for work, and starchilde firing you, then burning books in the
             middle of the showroom floor as a result.... ]

[00:25] [Vivian] (Am I burning the books or is he?)

[00:25] [gm] [ viktor -- what have you been doing over the last 3 hours ]

[00:26] [Viktor] (Viktor tried to stay awake, but probably drifted off
                 eventually)

[00:26] [gm] [ starchilde is sitting crosslegged on the floor, stroking a
             little bluebelly lizard on his knee while tearfully feeding
             books to the fire ]
[00:27] [gm] [ in your dream, that damned lizard is REALLY IMPORTANT in
             the way the only random dream images can be ]
[00:27] [gm] [ okay, so by 415, alex is starting to be fully awake, but still
             pretty beat up ]
[00:28] [gm] [ vivian is still blissfully snoring...err...breathing
             deeply...away ]

[00:29] [Vivian] (she does snore, albeit in a soft and ladlylike fashion --
                 she is a smoker, after all)

[00:29] [Viktor] (viktor will sleep like the dead if he does fall asleep)

[00:30] [gm] [ at 0430 stuff happens -- does anybody (ie alex or viktor
             since Vivian is in back) do anything in that interval? ]

[00:30] [Viktor] (not Viktor)

[00:31] [gm] [ alex? ]
[00:32] * gm 's finger descends from the heavens, transcending realities,
             giving Alex a gentle poke to see if he's still around

[00:34] [Alex] (Alex does something.)

[00:34] * Alex comes fully awake, lifts his head and blinks around
               groggily, then snaps upright.  He jumps to his feet, almost
               knocking his chair over, and hurries around to bend over
               Sabrina, placing a hand on her shoulder...

[00:36] * gm **Sabrina , tearfully, "I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...." Then
          tightens up, muffling a yell in nate's jacket.

[00:36] [gm] [ Viktor is sleeping in a chair nearby, twitching.... ]

[00:37] * Alex pats her shoulder helplessly for a few seconds, then glances
               down at his watch. He bites out a quiet, "Shit!" then more
               loudly, in Russian, "Viktor! Wake up, cousin! Wake your lazy
               ass up, man, now!"

[00:38] [gm] Sabrina's seizure passes , then she cocks her head to the
             side, rubbing her cheek against the back of his hand.

[00:38] * Viktor stirs a little and looks around groggily.
[00:39] [Viktor] "Where am I...", he mumbles..

[00:40] [Alex] [Russian] "Hell, remember?  Now wake up.  We're getting
               close to game time.  And where the fuck are Nate and Walter,
               anyways?"  He starts fishing for his cellphone...

[00:41] [Viktor] "What is it?  What is happening?". Viktor stirs, and leans
                 forward.

[00:41] [gm] [ vivian, after a moment, you turn to find althea and your
             desk since its almost time for class anyway ]
[00:41] [gm] [ but you're worried that starchilde already burned your
             books ]

[00:42] [Alex] [Russian]  "It's almost 4:30!  When's dawn?  Shit, it's
               almost game time, man, get up!  Go wake Vivian!"

[00:43] * Viktor gets up and stumbles to Vivian's room.

[00:44] * gm **Sabrina screams something about god in spanish as she
             abruptly leans forward, her scream transitioning into a
             wordless cry as her feet slip off the edge of the chair, arms
             clenched around her midsection.

[00:44] * Viktor trots over to Vivian and shakes her

[00:44] [Vivian] (The room Viktor finds Vivian in has literally hundreds of
                 spent shell casings on the floor.  Vivian is asleep on a
                 tatami mat in the middle of them.  She's still in her
                 jacket, but the angle she's lying in accentuates the
                 narrowness of her waist and the curve of her hip.)

[00:45] [gm] [ viktor, you walk into the hallway and turn left, looking
             for vivian, passing several empty rooms, including a richly
             appointed bathroom...yeah...what vivian said ]

[00:45] * Vivian mumbles, "It's okay, Althea, I got the lizard," but
                 doesn't wake up.

[00:45] * gm is cracking up

[00:46] * Alex withdraws his hand from Sabrina's shoulder and just stares
               at her helplessly for a half a minute, then slams through
               the menus on his phone until he finds Walter's number,
               presses the dial button...

[00:46] * Viktor yells back "Alex!! What is happening?!!"
[00:46] * Viktor shakes Vivian again

[00:46] [gm] [ alex, you dial walters phone, hearing viktor yelling back
             from the depths of the living space. ]

[00:47] * Vivian 's eyes slowly open.  She looks very groggy.
                 "Viktor-bear... what's going on?"

[00:47] * gm **Walter answers the phone on the second ring, "Alex.  We're
             on our way.  I've got the root."

[00:47] [Viktor] "Alex said to... Viktor-bear?? What???"

[00:48] * Vivian 's eyes snap all the way open.  "Oh, shit!  What time is
                 it?  What's going on?"

[00:48] * Alex , into the phone, "Fuck. Thank God. What time is sunrise,
               anyways?'

[00:48] [Viktor] "Alex is going on about sunrise.. so maybe its close?"

[00:48] * gm **Walter pauses, you can hear nate speaking in the background,
then he comes back to you, "Around six thirty.  Maybe a little later."

[00:49] * Vivian stretches out a hand to Viktor.  "Oh, no.  Help me up,
                 please -- we've got to get going."

[00:50] * gm **Sabrina screams again, a full throated, straight-from-the-
             diaphragm shriek, almost tumbling out of the chair.

[00:50] * Alex is silent for a moment, hisses out a sibilant "Shit!" then
adds more normally, "Okay! Okay... I'm thinking, maybe, some of us should
start setting up around a quarter 'til six. Some of us will drive Sabrina
around until it gets closer to sunrise. Sound good?"

[00:50] * Viktor pulls Vivian up and stumbles and almost falls on a shell
casing.

[00:51] [gm] [ alex, in the background you can hear walter say quietly,
             "Nate -- drive quicker." ]
[00:52] [gm] [ Vivian, there's no way you didn't hear sabrina's last
             cry. ]

[00:52] * Vivian chuckles, wearily and self-consciously.  "Oh, yeah.  Watch
                 out for those."  She then runs out to where Alex and
                 Sabrina are.  "Sabrina?!  Sabrina?!  Are you okay?!"

[00:53] * Viktor follows

[00:54] [gm] [ Vivian, you arrive out by the table to see sabrina half
             curled into a ball, sobbing, the spasms having gotten more
             severe looking less like shivering and more like
             convulsions. As you approach, she drops to knees, drawing a
             shuddery breath. ]
[00:55] [gm] [ I believe alex is speaking on the phone when you arrive...? ]

[00:55] * Vivian kneels down by Sabrina and puts an arm around her, trying
                 to keep her steady.  She stares daggers at Alex as long as
                 he's on the phone.

[00:56] * Viktor trots over and leans down. "What is wrong with her now?
                 You have spells, you say, that help her?"

[00:56] [Alex] (Correct, though if Walter doesn't respond, he's about to
               hang up.)

[00:56] [gm] ( sorry )

[00:56] * Vivian looks miserably at Viktor.  "I do, but they have to be
                 cast at a very specific time -- sunrise -- and at a very
                 specific place.  We need Nate and Walter back here, now!"

[00:56] * gm **Walter responds, "Yeah, set up what you can.  We'll be there
             in about 30.  Maybe less."

[00:57] [Viktor] "What?  Finally some of this makes some sense!"

[00:57] [Alex] "Fuck!" *click*

[00:57] [Vivian] "What?  What's going on?"

[00:58] * gm **Sabrina clings to vivian as soon as vivian lays hands on,
             burying her face in vivian's dress.

[00:58] * Alex moves to stand next to Vivian, Viktor, and Sabrina, phone
               clutched loosely in one hand.  He watches them silently,
               eyes a little wide, a little wild.

[00:58] * Vivian has both arms around Sabrina, holding her tight, but is
                 watching Alex, waiting for him to explain.

[01:00] * Alex scowls at Vivian, then looks away. He takes a deep breath,
               slides his phone into his pocket, then says in a quiet,
               controlled voice, "They're on their way. They'll be here in
               30 minutes. They've got the root. We're going to have one
               team prepare the ritual at the location, while another team
               stays mobile with Sabrina."

[01:01] * Vivian nods.  "Good plan.  I'm on the ritual team, of course.
                 Who else is going with whom?"

[01:02] * gm **Sabrina stifles another scream, her muscles clenching up.

[01:04] * Alex glares down at Sabrina in response to the scream, then,
               still in that calm tone, says, "I'll stay on the movement
               team, Viktor should stick with me.  Nate and Walter will
               help you, V."

[01:04] * Vivian rocks with Sabrina and tries to give her quiet comfort as
                 best she can.

[01:04] [Viktor] "Ok, where are we going?"

[01:05] * Vivian glares poison daggers at Alex.  "Don't call me -- oh, fuck
                 it.  Fine."

[01:05] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[01:06] [Vivian] (actually, it's 12:15 -- this might be a good place to
                 call it, even though the tension is high)

[01:06] [gm] ( up y'all. I'm good to go either way )
[01:06] [gm] ( up to y'all, i meant. )

[01:06] [Alex] (I'm pretty exhausted.  Have been for a while.  But I"m
               functional.)

[01:07] [Vivian] (Much as I hate to say it, I think I'm gonna have to call
                 it a night.  Damn.)
   
[01:07] [Viktor] (indeed... downer)

[01:08] [gm] okay.  it's a fair place to pause.  if we can get a lengthy
             session for the next one, I think we can finish this plot
             complication.

[21:45] [gm] [ okay, so last time, everyone had run to ground at the
             warehouse to rest, collect themselves and plan on the next
             stage of events. After some desultory planning, everyone
             spread out in the warehouse and took a nap (from about 1am
             until around 430am) ]
[21:46] [gm] [ it was at that point that sabrina's condition started to
             worsen quite rapidly, waking alex and Viktor, who in turn
             wakened the rest of the group. ]
[21:48] [gm] [ at the point, there was a pause as to what to do next since
             nate and walter hadn't returned from the hills with the
             verbena root (walter and nate headed out at around 1230 or so
             in Big Red, braving the chill and terrible wind to go tromping
             about in the darkness) ]
[21:49] [gm] [ after some quick and desperate strategizing (over sabrina's
             intermittent screams and the keening of the wind through the
             broken roof of the warehouse), the group opted to split up ]
[21:50] [gm] [ with one half taking the van and sabrina to keep her safe,
             and the other half heading down to the beach where walter had
             earmarked a good location for the ritual to take place
             (natural spring, somewhat sheltered, etc) ]
[21:51] [gm] while this last stage of planning was wrapping up (with vivian
             kneeling on the ground offering what comfort she could),
             walter called and informed everyone that he and nate had run
             into a bit of trouble, but had managed to get a goodly amount
             of the root and were on the way back (making it unnecessary
             for the group to chance taking the semi-cultivated root in the
             garden)
[21:52] [gm] [ which more or less takes us up to the present, with almost
             everyone in the warehouse, planning on making the final sprint
             to completion of the ritual. ]
[21:52] [gm] (are there any details I'm forgetting?)

[21:53] [Vivian] (We'd originally decided that Nate, Walter, and Vivian
                 were in the Ritual Group, and Alex, Viktor, and Sabrina
                 were in the Moving Sabrina Around Group.)

[21:53] [gm] (well, let's just stay with that, then, since it simplifies
             things)
[21:54] [gm] (when nate gets back, we'll start)

[21:54] * hamilton text messages Viv, "yo.  in town.  call me when you wake
                   up."
[21:55] [hamilton] (actually, maybe hold off on that until the rob returns)

[21:56] [gm] (which...he just did...)
[21:56] [gm] [ okay, Vivian -- ]
[21:57] [gm] [ as you glaring up at alex, just finishing with a scathing
             "oh fuck it. Fine" in response to Alex calling you 'V' again,
             you feel your cell vibrate, and make a faint little ping ]

[21:57] * Vivian suddenly starts fishing around in her purse, eventually
                 coming up with her cell phone.  She takes a few seconds to
                 read a message on it, then says, "Oh, my God!"
[21:58] * Vivian starts waving her phone around and brandishing it in
                 people's faces.  "You guys!  Hamilton's back in the
                 Valley!  He's back!"

[21:59] * gm **Sabrina doesn't acknowledge this, just shudders and makes a
             strangled little noise in her throat.

[22:03] *** Oxryly has joined #dblf

[22:03] [gm] heya dan

[22:04] <Oxryly> hey all

[22:04] [hamilton] (hamilton walks up one of the paths through the garden)

[22:04] *** Oxryly is now known as Viktor

[22:04] [hamilton] (oy!)(i'm eric, pleased to meetcha)

[22:04] [Viktor] (greetings Eric; I'm Dan)

[22:05] [Vivian] (Maybe Eric and Dan should describe their characters to
                 each other?)

[22:05] [gm] (yeah -- that'll give a smoother transition into play)
[22:06] [gm] (so, uhm, yeah -- describe each other....)

[22:07] [Viktor] (...organizing)

[22:07] [hamilton] [ 5'11", around 170lbs, brown hair looking like it has
                   been cut in such a way as to look stylishly unkempt. ]

[22:08] [Nate] ( Dan, you're missing half the fun over in #dlbf_ooc )

[22:08] [gm] ( #dblf_ooc )

[22:09] [Nate] er, yeah, that one

[22:09] [Viktor] (Viktor is a relatively huge Slavic looking man, seeming
                 to be in his mid twenties. He's about 275 lbs of
                 utilitarian muscle and moves fast and suddenly for someone
                 of his bulk.)

[22:10] [hamilton] [ carrying a small duffel and a guitar hard case.
                   Wearing jeans, black jacket looking rather worn.  more
                   babyface than real muscle (though viv would notice he
                   looks a bit thinner) ]
[22:11] * hamilton walks up one of the garden paths.
[22:11] [hamilton] "Viv.  Dear god, you guys are awake..."
[22:11] [hamilton] "what the fuck is happening, is the world ending?"

[22:12] [gm] [ gm requests a pause. ]

[22:15] [gm] [ hamilton, as you walk down the path, you can distantly hear
             a scream quite distinctly over the wailing of the wind. the
             interior of the warehouse is rather a relief -- warm, almost
             balmy -- in comparison to the outdoors.  You arrive, seeing
             vivian kneeling on the ground with sabrina cradled in her lap;
             a large slavic looking guy standing over them looking alert;
             alex looking distant and distracted and very unwelcoming off
             to one side. ]
[22:15] [gm] [ Vivian, check that about the text message; there is no
             message; instead, as you stare angrily up at alex, you see
             movement out of the corner of your eye..... ]
[22:15] [gm] [ unpauses ]

[22:16] [hamilton] "uh.... what's happening?"

[22:16] * Vivian yells, "Hamilton!"  She quickly makes sure Sabrina is
                 steady enough to sit on her own.  She then throws her arms
                 wide and runs over (despite the high-heeled boots) to
                 Hamilton.  She then grapples him, squishes herself against
                 him, and says, "You're back!"

[22:16] [hamilton] "hey viv.  sabrina?"

[22:17] * gm **Sabrina settles back on her side, curling up into a fetal
             position
[22:17] * gm **Sabrina gives no hint of recognition or acknowledgement

[22:17] * Vivian looks over her shoulder, notices Sabrina.  Her face falls
                 immediately.  She lets Hamilton go and runs back over to
                 Sabrina.  "Sabrina?"

[22:17] * gm [ She just lies on her side, shivering violently enough to
             nearly be convulsing. ]

[22:18] * hamilton hugs vivian tightly (around his bag and case), but lets
                   her go and follows her to sabrina

[22:18] * Viktor kneels down to Sabrina and puts a hand on her shoulder.
[22:18] [Viktor] "What is it..? Are you cold?"

[22:18] * hamilton to Viktor:  hey.

[22:18] [gm] (we're going to have to backpatch alex's response a little
             bit, but oh well)

[22:19] * hamilton to Vivian:  "what's going on?  your letter... it wasn't
                   this bad."

[22:19] * Viktor looks up at Hamilton. "Hello, I am Viktor. I'm new,
                 apparently."

[22:19] * Vivian looks very worried, but gestures absently to Hamilton and
                 then to Viktor.  "Hamilton, this is Viktor, Alex's cousin.
                 Viktor, this is Hamilton, itinerant musician."

[22:19] [hamilton] "I'm Hamilton.  I'm old, apparently."

[22:20] * Viktor guffaws.

[22:20] [hamilton] "now will anybody tell me what's going on?"

[22:20] [Viktor] (you'll notice, if you watch Viktor at all, that his
                 presence is more of an emotional than an intellectual
                 one.) 

[22:21] * gm **Sabrina murmurs quietly, "I'm dying."

[22:21] [Viktor] "Yes, and please, tell him so I can hear too."

[22:21] * gm then she clenches up hard, gritting her teeth, making another
             strangled noise in her throat."

[22:21] * Viktor stares down at her intently. "Sabrina! What is it?"

[22:22] * Vivian squeezes Sabrina's shoulder.  She sighs and straightens
                 up, looking Hamilton in the eyes.  "OK.  Nutshell time.
                 An evil woman who is really part of the Unseelie Court of
                 the Fey put a sort of demonic arthropod in Alex's pocket
                 at a party.  Sabrina found it and was bitten.  The bite
                 has essentially cursed her; first, it's made her very
                 sick, and the illness will become fatal if we don't do
                 anything about it."
[22:23] [Vivian] "...Second, it's made her a magnet for unpleasant
                 supernatural baddies of all flavors and sizes.  We've been
                 spending the last day running around like proverbial
                 chickens sans heads while finding ingredients for a ritual
                 which will heal Sabrina.  Nate and Walter are on their way
                 here with the last ingredient now.  As soon as they
                 arrive, we need to head to a spring to perform the ritual.
                 Oh, and it has to be done right at sunrise, or it won't
                 work."
[22:24] [Vivian] "Other than that, everything's cool."

[22:24] * hamilton sighs, then smiles wanly.  "Ah, it's all cool, then."
[22:25] [hamilton] "I thought we were really in trouble."
[22:26] * hamilton hugs viv again.

[22:26] * Vivian hugs him back, more gently this time, but more lingering.
[22:27] * Vivian looks towards the Garden's entrance, then back down at
                 Sabrina.  "God.  I hope Nate and Walter hurry up and get
                 here."

[22:27] [hamilton] "I brought a bottle of tequila, but maybe we should hold
                   off until afterwards"
[22:28] [hamilton] "what time is sunrise?"

[22:28] [Vivian] "Yeah.  Later on the ta-kill-ya.  Sunrise?  About 6:30, I
                 think."

[22:28] [Viktor] "Its when the sun... oh nevermind"

[22:29] * Vivian snorts and shakes her head at Viktor, grinning.

[22:29] * Viktor grimaces

[22:29] * hamilton looks Viktor up and down.  "So what's your super power?"

[22:29] * Viktor looks around for something to lift...
[22:30] * Viktor doesn't find anything. Stands up and just does some silly
                 flexing. "Maybe this is it?"

[22:30] * Vivian looks at Viktor.  "Oh, yeah.  Hamilton's one of us, too.
                 He's 'imbued,' as Alex puts it."

[22:30] [hamilton] "ah..... cool."

[22:30] [Viktor] "But I am not... I don't have any 'magic'."

[22:31] * Vivian shakes her head.  "You mean, you don't have any magic of
                 which you're aware.  You saw the message; you've got some
                 magic in there.  Somewhere."

[22:32] * Viktor looks at Vivian wide-eyed.

[22:32] * Vivian leans down and strokes Sabrina's hair.  "Hold on, sweetie.
                 As soon as the boys get back, we'll go for a ride."

[22:33] * Viktor looks down at Sabrina. "Maybe she would be better not on
                 the ground..?"

[22:34] * Vivian looks at Hamilton and Viktor.  "Yeah -- maybe one of you
                 big strong men could pick her up?  Get her off the ground,
                 give her some body heat, too?"
[22:34] * Vivian "She's absolutely not contagious, don't worry."

[22:34] * hamilton leans down

[22:34] * Viktor assists.

[22:34] [hamilton] and whispers in Sabrina's ear, then starts picking her
                   up.
[22:35] * hamilton eyes Viktor warily for a second, but then nods and
                   smiles and lets him pick her up.
[22:36] [hamilton] "Does walter still have that funky couch in the back?"
[22:37] * hamilton says, "I'll go find some blankets," and heads off into
                   the structure.

[22:37] [Vivian] "I think we should just stay here, so we're ready to move
                 when the guys get back."
[22:38] * Vivian grins at Viktor.  "I don't think Sabrina even weighs three
                 digits.  I'm pretty sure you can handle it, right, big
                 guy?" 

[22:39] * hamilton looks in the storage/guest rooms for blankets, comes
                   back and wraps them around Sabrina tenderly.

[22:39] [gm] [ Viktor, Sabrina is very very light in your arms -- hardly a
             strain at all. She shivers in your arms as you stand, looking
             for a place to deposit her. ]

[22:40] * Viktor carries Sabrina over to a wall and leans her against it as
                 Hamilton arrives with the blankets.

[22:41] * Vivian frowns at Viktor but says nothing.  She starts tapping her
                 foot anxiously.

[22:42] * gm **Sabrina , if left to her own, quickly crumples to her
             knees....

[22:43] [Nate] ( Vivian's cell phone rings.. )

[22:43] * Vivian shouts, "Hold her!" to Viktor, then flips open her cell.
                 "Hello?"

[22:43] [Nate] "Where you at?"

[22:43] * hamilton whispers to Vivian, but stops when the phone rings.

[22:44] * Viktor leans over to prop her up or support, as needs be.

[22:44] [Nate] "We found the root, where do we meet you?"

[22:44] * hamilton looks harshly at viktor and sits down holding sabrina,
                   pulling the blankets tighter around her.

[22:45] [Vivian] "At the Garden.  We're going to split up into two groups;
                 one to drive Sabrina around, another to set up the
                 ritual."  Then, more quietly, but urgently: "Hurry!  We're
                 losing her..."

[22:45] [Nate] (to the side..) "Walter, they're at the garden.  Sabrina's
               losing time.."
[22:45] [Nate] "We're on our way"

[22:46] [Vivian] "Good.  Bye."
[22:47] * Vivian clicks her phone shut and drops it back in her purse.  She
                 starts to walk over to a wall, but is wincing and limping
                 before she gets there.  She leans against it heavily.

[22:47] * Viktor looks at Vivian, "What.. you too?"

[22:48] * Vivian gives Viktor a casual wave.  "M'okay.  Foot hurts,
                 but... I'll live."

[22:48] [gm] [ would like to advance the plot.... s'okay? ]

[22:48] * Vivian smiles bitterly, looking down at her feet.  "Shouldn't've
                 gone back to the high heels, dammit."

[22:48] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[22:50] [gm] [ You guys wait a moment in awkward silence, the trees in the
             interior of the warehouse making an intermittent secretive
             rustle as a strong draft makes its way down through the
             roof. ]
[22:51] [gm] [ Nate and Walter arrive about 10 minutes later, both looking
             very ragged and torn up.  Walter seems to be bleeding quite
             heavily on his left thigh, and Nate looks like he's bitten
             though his lower lip (though it could just be a nasty bruise)
             ] 

[22:51] * hamilton quickly puts the guitar case and duffle inside, comes
                   back out stuffing stuff into a smaller bag.
[22:52] * hamilton slightly offput:  "hey."

[22:52] * Nate blinks at seeing Hamilton

[22:52] * Vivian leaves the wall and totters over to them, pointing at
                 Hamilton.  "Look who's back, you guys!"

[22:52] [Nate] "Damn, trouble brings all the crackers out of the woodwork!"

[22:52] [gm] [ both are ragged, dishevelled, and dirty. the wait for their
             arrival is only disturbed once when Sabrina abruptly starts
             shrieking -- right from the diaphragm -- and doesn't stop until
             shortly before they show up, fading to quiet, bubbling sobs ]
[22:52] [gm] [ gm, uhm, well, unpauses ]

[22:53] [Nate] ( Nate doesn't react to any of his own bleeding, unless it's
               getting into his eyes )

[22:53] [hamilton] "yeah... bring it on and all, but shouldn't we be
                   helping Sabrina or something?"

[22:53] * Viktor steadies Sabrina.

[22:53] [Nate] ( Nate still looks very tense, like he's about to snap. )
[22:53] [Nate] "Vivian told you the story?"

[22:53] * Vivian 's eyes go wide as she looks Nate and Walter up and down.
                 "Shit!  Are you guys OK?"

[22:53] *** Devo has joined #dblf

[22:53] [Viktor] "You guys get into some fun without me?"

[22:53] [hamilton] (monkey!!! arrrrrh!)

[22:55] [Nate] "There were some freaky creatures out in the woods.
               Remember those scorpion-like things that we found at
               Lindsey's?  And Sabrina's?"

[22:56] [hamilton] "and they could do that... to you..."

[22:56] [Nate] "I fell down a few times while we were moving in the dark."

[22:57] [Viktor] "Oh right... you 'fell'"

[22:57] [Nate] "There were big ones, like a good sized dog."

[22:57] * Vivian nods seriously, looking at Hamilton.  "Remember when I
                 said "every flavor of baddy"?  Vampires and monsters and
                 demons, oh my." 

[22:57] [Nate] "Don't toy with me", Nate glares at Viktor.

[22:57] * Viktor laughs awkwardly.

[22:58] * Vivian to Nate and Walter.  "I'm glad you guys are OK.
                 You... are OK, right?"

[22:58] [Nate] "Yeah.."
[22:58] * Nate eyes Viktor
[22:58] * Nate shakes his head, and looks for Sabrina.

[22:58] * Vivian claps her hands together.  "Well, then.  We need to
                 leave.  Like, now."

[22:58] [Nate] "Where's Sabrina?"

[22:58] [gm] [ gm requests a pause. ]

[22:59] [Viktor] "Hey... Nate... I'm not the one who fucked you up."
[23:00] * Viktor holds Sabrina steady.

[23:01] [gm] [ sabrina is lying over by the wall with her head in
             hamilton's lap (I believe). Walter stands, blinking, swaying
             slightly, looking pretty pale and tired, blood having soaked
             his pants from the knee down to his boot top; Alex is standing
             off to one side doing whatever devo tells us he's doing;
             sabrina is just weeping quietly, still shaking though less
             forcefully ]
[23:01] [gm] [ gm unpauses so everyone can orient.... ]

[23:02] [Nate] "Vivian, can you do something for Walter's leg?"

[23:02] *** Devo is now known as Alex

[23:02] [Nate] "I think one of those scorpion things got him."

[23:02] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "I don't think it's bleeding any
             more."

[23:03] * Vivian pouts.  "I can make him heal faster long-term, but nothing
                 short-term.  Besides, I need to save my 'mojo' for
                 Sabrina's spell.  I'm sorry, Walter."

[23:03] [Nate] "Ok.  Do we have everything now?"

[23:03] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "It's nothing. A little
             Mercurochrome and I'll be fine."
[23:04] * gm **Walter looks at vivian questioningly.

[23:04] * hamilton whispers to nobody in particular, "Are these
                   poisonous-type scorpions or just... non poisonous-type
                   scorpions?" 

[23:04] * Nate looks confused.  "I don't know.."

[23:04] * Vivian nods her head vigorously.  "Yes!  Let's get this show on
                 the road!"

[23:04] * hamilton nods and picks up Sabrina to the best of his ability.

[23:05] * gm **Walter sighs, glances at hamilton, "The brid was different
             from the thing that bit me and vivian."

[23:05] [Nate] "yeah, this was like a spider thing, with a tail, I think"
[23:05] [Nate] "except these were big, and luckily for us they were slow"

[23:06] * gm **Sabrina tries to stand with Hamilton's assistance, but
             convulses halfway to standing, and putting all her weight on
             him. 
[23:07] [gm] [ gm asks everyone to sound off on location. ]

[23:08] [Vivian] (With the bulk of the group, who I believe were standing
                 around near the entrance to the warehouse proper.)

[23:08] [Viktor] (next to Sabrina and Hamilton)

[23:08] [gm] [ I think we're all still mostly at location 2. ]

[23:09] [Vivian] (I'm fine with that.  That's where Vivian is too, then.)

[23:09] [gm] (sabrina is leaning against the wall, mostly propped up by
             hamilton.)
[23:10] [gm] (walter is standing by the table, looking weary, dirty, and
             beat up)
[23:11] [gm] so this is the stage as Alex comes walking down the path...? 

[23:13] [Alex] Everyone can hear the sound of Alex's voice faintly over the
               natural cacophony of the warehouse's unnatural fauna.  As it
               gets closer, as he gets closer, anyone paying attention can
               tell that he's singing the lyrics to Stone Temple Pilot's
               "Big Empty".  A few seconds after that, in synch with the
               line "too much trippin' and my shoes worn thin", Alex steps
               into the clearing.
[23:13] [Alex] (sorry, had to make it dramatic and all)

[23:14] [hamilton] "hey."

[23:14] * Vivian scowls at Alex.  "There you are, you prima donna!"  She
                 waves at Hamilton.  "Look who's here!"

[23:14] * hamilton almost says something, pauses to look at Vivian, turns
                   back to Alex.

[23:14] * Alex pauses to eye Hamilton a moment, unsurprised and nonplussed,
               "Hey. Welcome back." Turns toward Vivian, "Here I am. Are
               you sure?" 

[23:15] [hamilton] "Could we get going?"

[23:15] * Vivian claps her hands again.  "Yes!  We need to get going!  Now!
                 Does everyone remember what team they're on?"

[23:15] [Nate] "Let's do this"

[23:15] * Alex suddenly ignores them both and steps over to study Sabrina,
               crouching if necessary. "Yeah.... let's."

[23:16] * gm **Sabrina looks up at alex weakly, forcing a smile, "Hey
             Alex."

[23:16] * hamilton whispers to Alex, "whatever this is, I think it's
                   getting worse."

[23:17] * Vivian starts walking around, waving her arms, trying to wrangle
                 the group.  "Right!  Alex, Viktor, you're driving Sabrina
                 around.  Nate, you're driving Walter and me to the ritual
                 site to set up.  Hamilton, go with whichever group you
                 want.  Come *on* you guys!"

[23:17] * hamilton "leave it to you guys to make for an interesting
                   homecoming."

[23:17] * Alex looks up at Hamilton quietly, eyes bleary and bloodshot and
               heavy with dark rings. "Yeah... it's timed.  She's in the
               stretch when it could kill her, but she's okay, for now."

[23:17] [Nate] "Ok, we'll take the van."

[23:17] * hamilton follows Alex

[23:18] * Vivian is limping a bit and teetering on her heels, making her
                 wrangling attempts somewhat comical, but she keeps at it,
                 trying to get everyone moving.

[23:18] * Nate helps Vivian along

[23:18] * gm **Sabrina looks at Alex apologetically, says faintly, "I'm
             going to be screaming again pretty soon, hermano.  I don't
             think I'm going to be able stop this time. <she pauses> Not
             while I'm alive, anyhow."

[23:19] * Alex presses his brows together in a brief scowl, "Just hold on
               as long as you can."  He turns to Hamilton, nods towards
               Sabrina, "Help me take care of her?"

[23:19] * gm **Walter glances at Vivian, "I better go and get the verbena
             out of the truck.  I'll meet you guys at the van." He looks at
             Nate, "Bring weapons."

[23:19] * hamilton half carries her with Alex?

[23:19] * Nate nods.  "I'll load up."

[23:20] [Alex] (yeah, that's fine)

[23:20] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[23:20] [Alex] (ready)

[23:21] [gm] (okay)
[23:21] [gm] [ writes a novel... ]

[23:21] * Viktor follows Alex, Sabrina, etc..

[23:22] [gm] [ hamilton and Alex move to support Sabrina, and she shuffles
             slowly along, mostly not supporting her own weight, until
             finally one or the other picks her up and carries her. ]

[23:23] [Vivian] (I believe the 2 of them were already carrying her.)

[23:23] [Alex] (that's what I was thinking)

[23:23] * Vivian starts limping doggedly towards the van outside.  "Come
                 on!"  She doesn't stop until she's in the van's passenger
                 seat, short of someone grabbing her.

[23:23] [gm] [ the group moves through the warehouse, over the small wooded
             path, eventually arriving at the cracked bit of wall opening
             onto the weedy back lot. ]

[23:24] * Nate helps Vivian hobble to the van

[23:26] [gm] [ the group moves toward the van, the temperature seeming to
             drop about 20 degrees. it's not freezing, but the wind manages
             to find every tear, seam, or loose button in your clothing. ]
[23:27] [gm] [ as you approach the front fence, several things happen, so
             the gm pauses to marshall his troops ]

[23:27] * hamilton lets Alex take the weight for a while and tries to wrap
                   the blanket tighter around Sabrina

[23:27] * Vivian shivers and her teeth chatter until she's in the van with
                 the door closed.
    
[23:27] [hamilton] (ok)

[23:28] * Nate starts the van and turns up the heat

[23:28] [gm] ( rob, wait. )

[23:29] [Nate] (ok)

[23:31] * Alex slows suddenly, along with a sharp "Shit!" He pauses for a
               moment, and then, "Okay, battlestations people. You're all
               now in danger. There's something waiting for us out there."

[23:31] * Nate looks for something convenient to lean Vivian against.

[23:31] * Viktor glances around. "Something? *What*?"

[23:31] [hamilton] "ok.  you got her or me?"

[23:32] [Alex] "I got her."

[23:32] * Vivian smacks Nate lightly on the shoulder, and whispers, "I can
                 stand!  Get ready!"

[23:32] * gm **Walter moves forward, pulling his machete out of its canvas
             sheath.

[23:33] * hamilton pulls a wooden stake out of his pack.

[23:33] * Vivian fishes a little can of FaStop Pepper Spray out of her
                 purse, and starts looking around nervously.

[23:33] * Nate slips out of his sweat jacket.

[23:33] [Alex] "Dunno, Vik.  Could be those freakish little purple
               bastards.  Vampires.  Redcaps... any of this town's little
               nasties." 
[23:34] * Alex is quiet a moment, then speaks up again, "Probably not those
               redcaps. I think they think their job is done for the
               night." 

[23:34] * gm **Walter arrives at the front gate, pauses, then pushes it
             open, checking to make sure that Nate is on his LEFT when he
             steps out, with everyone else arrayed out behind him.

[23:34] [Nate] (heh)

[23:34] [gm] [ pauses, "Okay, everyone roll initiative, then do a
             roll-call." ]

[23:34] * Nate flanks Walter

[23:35] [hamilton] (1)

[23:35] [Nate] (2)

[23:35] [Vivian] (minus-1)

[23:35] [gm] [ I have to be a hardcore nazi about location here, cuz
             there's too many people, and I don't have the graphical set up
             yet. ] 

[23:36] [Viktor] (1)

[23:37] [Vivian] (Vivian is standing right behind Nate.)

[23:37] [Viktor] (sorry... -1)

[23:37] [gm] [ okay -- walter is on the sidewalk on the right side; nate is
             on the left; I'm assuming that alex & sabrina are in the
             middle of the box; ]

[23:38] [hamilton] [ Hamilton is between alex & sabrina and nat & walter ]

[23:38] [gm] [ where is hamilton and viktor? let's use a telephone keypad?
             walter is on the 3, nate is on the 1, vivian must be either on
             the 2 or the 4 ]

[23:38] [Vivian] (The 4)

[23:38] [gm] [ alex and sabrina are on the 5? ]

[23:38] [Viktor] (... 5)
[23:38] [Viktor] (or 6)

[23:38] [gm] [ ...with viktor? ]

[23:39] [Nate] [ I think Alex and Sabrina would be on 8 ]

[23:39] [gm] [ okay, so alex and sabrina are on the 8 ]

[23:39] [Alex] (OOC channel)

[23:45] [gm] [ as the groups spreads out, heading toward the van, pulling
             stakes, knives, machetes, spell components, etc you are
             treated to a bizarre and perhaps frightening sight: ]
[23:47] [gm] [ approaching from the left (down the sidewalk toward 1) you
             can see a guy with the distinctive misshapen face of a
             vampire, eyes glimmering yellow in the dim light stand up from
             the shadows near the base of the fence and turn sharply to
             face you. ]
[23:48] [gm] [ there's perhaps a second of hesitation, then he sprints
             without preamble toward the group along the fence, his gaze
             focused on Alex and Sabrina, running literally with his arms
             outstretched reaching toward them. ]

[23:48] * Nate moves to get in front of the vampire to mop up the sidewalk
               with him.

[23:49] * Viktor does likewise

[23:49] * Alex watches it coming blankly.

[23:49] [gm] (one sec)
[23:50] [gm] [ from across the street, you hear a clatter, and a second
             vampire comes stumbling out of an alley, half tripping over a
             trash can, then charging, making a high-pitched eager
             squealing noise inthe back of his throat; his yellow eyes also
             catching the light ]
[23:51] [gm] [ nate, with 2 successes, what do you? ]

[23:52] * Nate attacks the vampire coming from the left, the one headed
               roughly towards him.  Unfortunately his stakes are in the
               van. 

[23:52] [gm] [ nate, you've one bearing down on you from the left, and one
             across the street.... ]
[23:59] [gm] [ forumlates round 1: one sec ]
[00:05] [gm] [ nate, you watch as the vamp closes the distance in a series
             of quick, unnaturally large leaps, crashing into you, clearly
             intent on plowing you aside and moving into alex and S. you
             shift your balance, manage to redirect him into the chainlink
             fence, watching as he rebounds toward you, perfunctorily
             dodging and blocking your blows as he tries to slip past.
             You hit him several times, but nothing seems to land
             solidly. ]
[00:08] [gm] [ walter times the swing of his machete, but his leg gives way
             and stumbles slightly, his first stroke going wide of the
             mark, though still cutting the vamp on the shoulder. the vamp
             shrieks loudly, then roughly shoves walter to the side, hard
             enough to impact the van with a loud thud. ]
[00:10] [gm] [ having momentarily dispatched walter, the vamp continues
             toward the center of the box, not even pausing to look at
             viktor, instead looking past him toward alex ]
[00:16] [gm] [ viktor, the vamp tries to plow through you too, but after
             your first jab lands, it stumbles backward, keeps trying to
             dodge left and right past you, not really attacking, but
             moving too swiftly to land a clean hit again ]
[00:16] [gm] [ vivian -- you wanna fastop around viktor? ]

[00:17] [Vivian] (If either (a) I have a clear shot, or (b) Viktor's back
                 is to me, then yes.)

[00:18] [gm] [ (a) not really, (b) sometimes ]

[00:18] [Vivian] (then, no -- I'll reserve my action until I have a clear
                 shot)

[00:18] [gm] [ vivian, they're moving around alot. fastop is a foam, so
             it's less likely to be blown apart in the wind and get
             everybody ]

[00:19] [Vivian] (She has her finger on the button.  If they break apart
                 for even a second, or if the vamp gets past Viktor, she'll
                 go for it.)

[00:23] [gm] [ is vivian willing to gamble? if so, there are plenty of
             opportunities; if not, then she probably comes close to
             spraying several times, but doesn't. ]

[00:24] [Vivian] (She'll gamble.)

[00:28] [gm] [ vivian, you juke and dodge with the vamp assulting viktor,
             looking for an opening, and manage to find a good window --
             using the wind you let loose with a blast seemingly at
             viktor's head only to have the wind blow it right into the
             vamps face; it shrieks and stumbles backward at about the same
             time as hamilton yells to nate and tosses a stake; nate neatly
             plucks it out of the air concluding round 1 ]
[00:28] [gm] ( okay, let's try this 1x1 now. )
[00:28] [gm] ( roll initiative, everyone. )

[00:28] * Vivian shrieks in delight as the blast flies home.

[00:29] [gm] ( okay, hamilton, what do you do now that nate has caught
             that stake? )

[00:29] [hamilton] ( did I manage to get the watergun out? )

[00:30] [gm] ( roll agility at 3x -- you were waiting for an opportunity to
             get the stake to Nate. )

[00:31] [hamilton] ( nope.  guess that's what I'm doing this round )
[00:31] [hamilton] ( can I try to pull it out and fire this round? )

[00:31] [gm] ( okay -- let's say that it only takes half the round, and
             defers you to 1 succeess -- sound fair? )

[00:32] [hamilton] ( nod )
[00:32] [hamilton] ( sounds good to me, feel free to move on in init )

[00:33] [Vivian] (am I next?)

[00:33] [gm] [ walter is stunned, and slips to the ground, landing in a
             crouch; as the round closes, he looks up, gritting his teeth,
             looking wild and pissed. ]
[00:33] [gm] [ after Nate -- he also rolled 4 ]

[00:33] [Vivian] (OK.)

[00:36] [gm] [ Nate, with hamilton's stake in hand you begin trying to get
             a good stab on the vamp, you stab it several times inflicting
             shallow wounds, but its end comes when it half shoves you to
             one side, its arms outstrecthed, its feral yellow gaze
             focused on alex. ]
[00:37] [gm] [ you basically stab it in the back as it goes past, your fall 
             and its movement taking you to the ground on top of it. you
             blink ash painfully out of your eyes and push yourself up to
             your knees. ]
[00:38] [gm] [ vivian...? ]

[00:40] [Vivian] (Vivian tries to add injury to injury by squirting the
                 vamp she squirted the last time.)

[00:40] [gm] [ same diff ]
[00:43] [gm] [ Vivian moves forward little bit, shifting to the right to
             get a clearer shot, then waits it out as viktor moves in on
             it; again her timing is good, and with a squirt finishes the
             bottle, painting more white foam across his face ]

[00:45] [Viktor] [watches in horror as the first vamp disintegrates]

[00:45] [gm] [ viktor, what do you do? vivian sprayed the vamp in the face
             with something white and foamy (making it scream in agony and
             stumble away) and you got a quick glance out of the corner of
             your eye as vivian moves to your right ]
[00:46] [gm] [ is viktor stunned? ]

[00:46] [Viktor] [Viktor clocks the next vamp]

[00:46] [gm] [ roll attack, defense then ]

[00:46] [Viktor] [attack 9, defense 1]
[00:47] [Viktor] [sorry attack 9, defense 2]

[00:48] [gm] [ okay, Viktor, you watch in horror as the other vamp goes to
             dust with Nate atop it just after he stabs it viciously in the
             back; then you turn as the vamp, still clawing at its face
             moves forward to attack, shaking its head and screeching again
             when Vivian squirts it a second time. ]
[00:50] [gm] [ You move in, leading with a jab-jab-reverse, but it barely
             seems phased by the blows, leading you to plant your feet,
             pull back your arm and hammer it in the face. and again. and
             again (bones cracking). and again (blood sprays from
             somewhere). and again (it drops to one knee). ]
[00:51] [gm] [ without preamble (and perhaps a tad recklessly), Viktor
             moves up on it, grabs its head and shoulder, throws it to the
             ground, plants his right knee on the vamps back (right b/t the
             shoulder blades), puts his hands on its chin, and pulls up and
             back. HARD. ]

[00:51] [Viktor] "Ew... yuk!!]

[00:52] [gm] [ you're rewarded by a loud CRACK of its neck popping....but
             it only starts to scream on and on, its head bloody, foamy,
             pulled up and back at a VERY unnatural angle ]
[00:52] [gm] [ hamilton? alex? ]

[00:52] * Vivian makes a choking noise and covers her mouth with her hand
                 at the gruesome sight.

[00:53] [Viktor] "Man where's a curb when you need it"

[00:53] [hamilton] [ distance between hamilton and the vamp? is viktor
                   holding it stationary? ]

[00:53] [gm] [ maybe 10', and uhm, yeah -- VERY fucking stationary ]

[00:54] [hamilton] [ hamilton sprays it with his supersoaker pistol ]

[00:55] [gm] [ hamilton begins spraying the vamp remorselessly, bringing
             the stench of burning flesh to the fore; its screams increase
             in pitch in volume, its limbs twitching spasmodically as the
             holy water begins burning its face off ]
[00:56] [gm] [ alex, you watch as the vampire is reduced to a gruesome,
             shrieking, paralyzed, blind, stinking, fastopped ruin. ]

[00:56] [Alex] (ew!)
[00:57] * Alex starts hurrying Sabrina towards his car, fishes in his
               pocket for his keys to remote unlock it...

[00:57] [Nate] "Let's get out of here"

[00:57] * Vivian staggers a couple of steps backward, looking kind of
                 green.  "Is-- is everyone okay?"

[00:57] [gm] [ it continues screaming as you run out of water, even the
             bones of its face beginning to look soft and spongy ]

[00:57] * Alex carries Sabrina in his arms for this.

[00:57] * Nate finishes off the other vampire.

[00:58] * hamilton unloads his pistol, then tosses it back into his bag and
                   pulls out another stake.

[00:58] * gm **Walter stands over it, watching grimly as hamilton gets
             another squirt gun, fingering his machete as Nate approaches
             with a stake. 

[00:58] * Viktor steps back from the ruined vampire with a grimace.
[00:59] [Viktor] "That thing.... was it alive?"

[00:59] * Vivian gives Viktor a weak, queasy smile.  "Yes.  And no."

[00:59] [Alex] "No time for that, tovarische!  Get in my car!  Hurry!"

[00:59] [hamilton] "Don't you watch horror movies?"

[00:59] [gm] [ it's still screaming as Nate approaches, its head
             following Alex and Sabrina. ]

[00:59] * Alex yells as he starts trying to bundle Sabrina into the
               passenger seat.

[00:59] [gm] [ Nate stabs it once, hard and clean, feeling the tip of the
             stake as it hits asphalt. ]

[01:00] * hamilton hands Viktor a wooden stake.
[01:00] [hamilton] and gets in the van behind sabrina

[01:00] [gm] [ The vamp dusts, its screams quieting to a slurry whisper,
             then to silence. ]

[01:00] * Viktor stares dumbly at the stake.

[01:00] * Nate catches his breath
[01:00] [Nate] "These don't bleed.  The ones that gush blood bother me
               more."

[01:01] [Viktor] "Well it don't fight that well I guess. But fuck... you
                 have to kill it with some strange stuff!"

[01:01] [hamilton] "There's no place like home..."

[01:01] * Alex turns and yells at everyone before sprinting around to the
               driver's side, "You're all still in danger!" His voice drops
               an octave, "SO MOVE!"

[01:01] * gm **Walter looks up, wipes his hand down his shirt, "We'd better
             get going."

[01:01] * Vivian limps quickly to the van's passenger door, yanks it open,
                 and clambers inside.

[01:01] * Nate helps Vivian get into the van.

[01:02] [hamilton] "Viktor!  You're coming with us!"

[01:02] * Viktor starts moving towards the van.

[01:02] * gm **Walter waits a moment, nods at Nate, then climbs in,
             limping, "We all going in the van?  Dropping the ritual team
             on the way?" 

[01:03] [Nate] "Just the 3 of us, to set up the ritual."

[01:03] * gm **Walter nods.

[01:03] [Nate] "Alex and Viktor will keep Sabrina safe until we're ready."

[01:03] [Viktor] "What?  Alex... should I stay or go with them?"

[01:04] [Alex] "With me, cousin!"

[01:04] [gm] [ gm requests a pause. ]

[01:04] [Alex] "We need your muscle!"

[01:04] [gm] [ so, Walter is in the van,  Sabrina is in alex's car." ]

[01:04] [Alex] (pausing)

[01:05] [gm] [ where is everyone else? ]

[01:05] * hamilton is in Alex's car.

[01:05] [gm] [ I guess Alex's car is parked behind the van. ]

[01:05] * Viktor is in Alex's car.

[01:05] [Vivian] (In the front seat of Nate's van, breathing hard and
                 looking a bit wild-eyed.)

[01:05] [gm] [ okay. got it. unpausing. ]
[01:08] [gm] [ Alex, you watch impatiently as Viktor and hamilton load up
             into your car, Sabrina already strapped into the passenger
             seat? ] 
[01:09] [gm] [ The rest of the group piles into the van.  Walter just sits
             back, tilting his head back against the seatback, closing his
             eyes and seemingly falling into a doze. ]

[01:09] * Alex starts the car.  The stereo is -off-, unusually.

[01:10] [hamilton] "How we doing on the radar?"

[01:10] * Vivian turns to Nate.  "Nate?  You know where we're going?"

[01:10] * gm **Sabrina leans forward, arms wrapped around her stomach, then
             mumbles quietly and breathily, "It feels like my insides are
             made of glass..."

[01:11] [Nate] "Walter?  Can you guide me there?"

[01:11] [Viktor] "So where are we going?"

[01:11] * gm **Walter speaks from the back seat, his eyes still closed,
             "Follow the 6, make a right on the frontage."

[01:11] * hamilton to Viktor: "Anywhere but here."

[01:12] * Alex turns his attention to Sabrina for a moment, a scowl etching
               deep lines in his forehead. "Just a little longer,
               hermanita... just a little longer!"

[01:12] * Vivian calls Alex on his cell phone.

[01:12] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "Left -- make a left.  When the
             frontage tries to go back again, keep going on the maintenance
             road." 

[01:12] [Nate] "Got it"

[01:13] [Alex] As soon as Alex's car is loaded, he drops the car into drive
               and hits the accelerator hard.  Too hard.  The tires
               overspin, kicking up dirt without getting any traction.
               Alex backs off, tries again, more gently...

[01:14] [gm] [ at the rough jerk, sabrina screams breathily, then inhales
             and screams again, full volume, hard enough to leave your ears
             ringing in the confined space. ]

[01:14] * hamilton to Alex, "which direction are they going?  Should we
                   circle downtown or something?"

[01:14] * Vivian hangs up and redials until Alex picks up.  "God, what are
                 they doing back there?" she says to no one in particular.

[01:14] [Alex] (pause)
[01:17] * Alex glances at Hamilton in his rear view mirror, "I was thinking
               East, towards the hills.  Loop back around towards north
               downtown after."  His cell starts vibrating, making him
               swear softly.  He fishes his cell out of his pocket, flips it
               open one-handedly, "What?!" he sounds unnecessarily harsh.

[01:18] * Vivian for once doesn't react to his tone of voice.  "Hey.
                 Follow us until we get to the ritual site.  That way
                 you'll know where to come back to, 'kay?"

[01:18] [gm] [ the day is already starting to lighten, leaving a slight
             paler blue line along the hills to the east. ]

[01:18] [Alex] "Er... yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I guess that makes sense.  But
               I'm not going to stop.  Don't want to draw any of the
               nasties to you, right?"

[01:19] [Vivian] "Right.  Don't stop, just follow us until WE stop, then
                 keep going."  She pauses.  "Alex, are you OK to drive?"

[01:19] * hamilton leans back, breaths deeply, then turns to Viktor,
                   "First time?"

[01:20] [Viktor] "Whatever it is... yes, the first time."

[01:21] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ]

[01:21] [Alex] "Wha?  Yes.  We don't have time.  Just go."

[01:21] [hamilton] "ah...  well... you kind of get used to it, strange as
                   that sounds."

[01:21] [Viktor] "I suppose you must."

[01:21] * Vivian Nate sees Vivian's jaw tighten, then she responds to Alex:
                 "Don't be a fucking macho man, OK?  It's all right if
                 you're freaked out.  Let Hamilton drive, or something."

[01:22] [Nate] "Ask if he'll let Hamilton drive."

[01:22] [Alex] "I will if I need him too.  You should probably call his
               phone next time, though.  I can't drive and talk at the same
               time if something's going down."

[01:22] [Viktor] "I've seen some strange things. For some reason this isn't
                 that odd.... I wonder why that is...."

[01:22] * Alex sounds cold and distracted.

[01:23] [hamilton] "It kind of makes sense, when you think about it."

[01:23] * Vivian sighs.  "Yeah.  Okay.  Fair enough."  She clicks her phone
                 shut and turns to Nate.  "Let's go!"

[01:23] [gm] [ Alex's phone is likely picking up Sabrina's whimperings in
             the background. ]

[01:23] [Viktor] "I guess I know how to hit things hard.  If thats what I
                 need to do, I don't have any problems!"

[01:23] [hamilton] "A lot more sense than all this stuff happening in Happy
                   Valley and there not being vampires."
[01:24] * hamilton looks at Viktor oddly.

[01:24] * Vivian sounds fairly in control when talking to Alex, but sounds
                 urgent and more than a little freaked-out when she says
                 "Let's go!" to Nate.

[01:24] [Nate] "Yeah.  Keep an eye on Walter; he looks pretty messed up."

[01:24] * gm **Walter shakes his head, "Walter is just tired."

[01:25] [Viktor] "What do you mean?   Oh... if there weren't vampires?"

[01:25] [hamilton] "What, you mean if it were just serial killers or
                   something?  That's a lot of serial killers in one city."

[01:25] * Vivian chuckles weakly.  "I dunno, Walter -- you're starting to
                 talk in the third person.  That's a bad sign."

[01:25] * hamilton to the whole car:  "You guys should move to Seattle.
                   It's a lot quieter up there."

[01:26] [Vivian] (Has Nate started driving yet?)

[01:27] [Viktor] "Ha! If I can get good work... I'll go."

[01:27] [Nate] (yes, following Walter's directions)

[01:27] [gm] [ in the van, nate drives on westward along highway 6, with
             Alex following behind.  For the people in the van, it's tense
             as you approach the overpass, then turn left onto the frontage
             road, following it for about half a mile. ]

[01:27] * Alex doesn't respond to Hamilton's quip beyond a quick glance at
               him in the rearview mirror again.  He seems far too
               engrossed in his driving task.

[01:27] [gm] [ Nate eventually has to turn the wipers on to deal with the
             spatter from the ocean, picked up and carried by the wind. ]

[01:28] [Nate] "At least it's water and not bats..."
[01:28] * Nate says to himself

[01:29] * Vivian whimpers, "Ohhh, God.  Don't remind me about the fucking
                 bats."  She puts her hand over her eyes.  "Thanks for
                 dragging me out of that water I slipped into, by the way.
                 That would've been a really fucking stupid way to die."

[01:29] [gm] [ walter guides you toward the turnoff, then motions for you
             to take a narrow dirt path leading away from a turnabout.
             about a quarter of a mile further on, you arrive at a chain
             link fence. Walter smiles faintly as the van stops, "Sledge
             time. Better stay in the van, nate -- you know how you attract
             trouble...." ]

[01:30] [Nate] "That's why we went in together, so we could make sure we
               got out ok."

[01:30] [gm] [ gm requests a pause. ]
[01:31] [gm] [ okay, nevermind -- something occurred to me, but I think
             it's inconsequential. ]

[01:31] * Alex follows the van closely, carefully.  When they stop at the
               fence, Alex pulls the car around in a half circle, so that
               when he rolls down his window and leans out, he can talk
               easily to Walter, "How far from here?"

[01:33] [gm] [ Alex, you pull in behind the van, watching as walter steps
             out, you roll down the window.  Walter limps up, sledge in his
             right hand, "It's about a half a mile further on. I'll have
             Nate turn around and put the lights on -- just in case.  It's
             easy to miss if you're not paying attention." ]

[01:33] * Nate looks back at Walter and says, "Ok, knock that fence open
               then."

[01:34] * Alex nods, once, "Thanks. Good luck. And... don't fuck up. No
               pressure, though." He flashes a wry, bitter grin, then moves
               the car back down the way they came.

[01:34] * gm **Walter , shouting to be heard over the sound of wind and
             surf, says "We'll get this set up -- but it's going to be
             tough. Be careful on the road -- I think there's a, well, a
             little shanty near the road."

[21:19] [gm] where'd we leave everybody last? I'm skimmin as fast as I
             can....  

[21:20] [Vivian] (When we left our heroes (and heroines): The van (with 
                 Nate, Vivian, and Walter) and the Expense (with Alex, 
                 Hamilton, Sabrina, and Viktor) had turned off the 
                 highway and gone 1/4 mile up a dirt road. They're now 
                 1/2 mile away from the ritual site, but a chain is 
                 blocking their path.)

[21:20] [hamilton] [ or viv drives around with alex and hamilton while 
                   Sabrina prepares the.... uh... shit, nevermind ] 

[21:20] [Vivian] (Walter grabbed the sledge and he and Nate were about to 
                 pulverize the offending chain. Once at the site, 
                 Vivian, Walter, and Nate were going to set up, while 
                 Alex drove off with his group to keep Sabrina moving 
                 (and away from monsters, hopefully)). 

[21:48] [gm] okay 
[21:49] [gm] ( so, as doug was was good enough to point out, last time 
             we had split up; walter had just stepped out of the van, 
             and after briefly yelling some instructions or warnings 
             over the wind and surf at alex, he turned and limped back 
             to the padlocked chainlink fence ) 
[21:50] [gm] [ walter watches as alex pulls his car into a U turn, 
             heading away into the predawn darkness (it's what, 0600 
             right now?) ] 

[21:53] * Vivian turns to Walter. "It's still a half mile off, right? 
                 Is it just off the dirt road, or should Alex keep 
                 following us?" 

[21:53] * hamilton hums, "I think I'm dumb, maybe just happy." 

[21:53] [gm] [ everyone take a minute to reread the last five minutes of 
             the transcript.... that might help to sync us up better. ] 

[21:54] [Alex] (done) 

[21:54] [hamilton] [check] 

[21:54] [gm] ( cool. okay.... ) 

[21:55] [Vivian] (Wow... I totally spaced Alex's last comment. OK. Belay
                 that last comment from Vivian.) 

[21:55] [gm] ( it's cool -- that's why I post transcripts..... ;) ) 

[21:56] * Vivian gets out of the van and leans against it while Walter 
                 and Nate go to work on the chain. She lights a 
                 cigarette and smokes it in anxious, clipped drags. 

[21:57] [gm] [ walter turns and limps to the fence, absently spinning 
             the sledge in his hands in a circle, his hair blowing 
             wildly in the wind. even over the skirling of the wind on 
             the van's exterior you can hear the pounding of the surf ] 

[21:58] * Alex puts all of his attention into driving as fast as his 
               exhaustion and road conditions will safely allow. His 
               car is still uncharacteristically devoid of music. 

[21:58] [gm] [ walter pauses for a second, looks around to see where 
             nate is, then swings the sledge in a short, sharp 
             semi-circle. sparks fly as the head hits the lock, then 
             embeds itself into the dirt, the muscles in walter's back 
             briefly standing out in the harsh headlights of the van ] 

[21:59] * Vivian listens to the surf pound and says quietly, to 
                 herself: "Wow. All hail fucking Poseidon." 

[22:02] [gm] [ walter then pulls the chain through and pushes the 
             fence back, waiting motionlessly, leaning on the handle 
             of the sledge as the van passes, then quickly climbs back 
             in ] 

[22:02] * hamilton stares anxiously out the rear window as they drive 
                   away, singing under his breath. 

[22:02] * Vivian says nothing else while she watches Walter work, just 
                 follows the movement of his back muscles through 
                 narrowed eyes until she finishes her cigarette. When 
                 Walter finishes, she flicks the butt away and hops 
                 back in the passenger's seat, slamming the door. 

[22:02] [gm] [ a moment later, the van moves down the dirt road, 
             bumping over its semi finished surface ] 
[22:03] * gm **Walter leans his head back and closes his eyes,
             sighing as he settles into the back seat, "I need a 
             vacation." 

[22:04] * Vivian chuckles. "No shit." She twists in her seat to face 
                 Walter. "Hey. Is the site pretty much in wilderness, 
                 or will there be people around?" 

[22:05] [gm] [ As nate drives slowly up the road, walter speaks quietly, 
             "It's about half a mile up. There's a little shanty just 
             west of the freeway. It's between a couple of the piers 
             about half way up the slope between the docks and the 
             freeway. ] 

[22:06] [Vivian] "Anybody live in the shanty?" 

[22:06] * gm **Walter sits up, studies Vivian for second 
             expressionlessly, "There probably won't be too many 
             people around on the docks. We're going to be at the 
             southern end, near the older side." 
[22:07] * gm **Walter nods, but doesn't elaborate. 

[22:08] * Vivian stares at Walter for a few seconds, frowning 
                 quizically. Then she faces forward in her seat and 
                 starts checking through her ritual supplies. She 
                 nods, noting she has everything, then compulsively 
                 checks them again. 

[22:08] [gm] [ The dirt road is fairly straight, dipping and rising to 
             follow the contour of the land, crossing two or three 
             little streams where they cut the road over partially 
             blocked drainage pipes. ] 

[22:10] * Vivian opens the mirror in the passenger-side sun visor and 
                 starts checking her makeup and straightening her 
                 bangs. 

[22:10] [gm] [ As nate tops a rise, you can see on the left, a smallish 
             collection of aluminum siding and dirty sheets sitting in 
             the middle of what looks like a midden heap of broken 
             glass, discarded appliances, yard waste and other things 
             that have gathered in a small partially enclosed V ] 

[22:11] * Vivian points. "Ew! What's all that?" 

[22:11] [gm] [ To the East, you can see the ground rising up to the 1 where  
             the trash covers the hillside, giving evidence to the 
             illegal dumping ground this loop of the roadway has 
             become. ]

[22:12] [Vivian] "Tchh! What're we going to have to fight next, fucking Trash 
                 Trolls?" 

[22:12] * gm **Walter nods, "There's a sort of loop off the 1 up 
             there. Just enough cover from trees and stuff that people 
             dump stuff here." 

[22:13] * Vivian scowls and shakes her head. "Ew. People are gross." 

[22:13] * gm **Walter's frown deepens as Nate idles past a handful of 
             aluminum structures, the flicker of at least 1 campfire 
             evident in the darkness, "All kinds of trash end up 
             here." 

[22:14] * Vivian bites her lower lip nervously. "I hope the site is 
                 out of view. I really don't want an audience for 
                 this." 

[22:15] [gm] [ As if in answer to vivian's concerns, the van pulls 
             around a curve of the road, putting a fold of the land 
             between you and the shanty. ] 
[22:16] * gm **Walter calls out abruptly, "Stop. It's close to here. 
             We're going to have to look around a little bit on foot 
             -- I don't recall _exactly_ where it is." 
[22:17] * gm **Walter glances at Vivian, "Don't wander too far toward 
             the dumping area." 

[22:17] * Vivian nods. "OK. Walter, can you hand me my Super Soaker? 
                 It's in the back there somewhere." 
[22:17] [Vivian] "It's only got a couple of squirts left, but it's better 
                 than nothing." 

[22:18] [gm] [ Nate stops the van, pulling it around in a neat 3 point 
             turn, then parks just off the road after leaving the 
             hazzards on, "Don't want anyone hitting it in the dark," 
             he explains desultorily just before hopping out. ] 
[22:18] * gm **Walter hands it forward without comment, then slides 
             the door open and steps out. 

[22:19] * Vivian slings her purse over her shoulder, tucks the Soaker 
                 under her other arm, and hops out of the van... 
[22:19] [Vivian] ...landing awkwardly. "Oww! Stupid foot," she says,
                 petulantly.  
[22:21] * Vivian scans the area, limping slightly. "Walter, where's 
                 the spring?" 

[22:21] * gm **Walter glances over at vivian, his pant leg looking 
             black in the predawn light, "It's hard to see until you 
             come up on it -- be careful, it's deeper than it looks. I 
             think they tried to make a well out of it or something, but 
             it's all broken up now, just leaking down into the 
             ocean." 

[22:23] * Vivian reaches into her purse and pulls out the plastic 
                 water bottle. She holds it aloft and shakes it 
                 vigorously, making it glow like a fluorescent lamp. 

[22:23] * gm **Walter continues, "It's probably purer up here, though 
             it's easier to find near the ocean," he points down toward 
             the faintly luminous surf, the piers looking like giant 
             black insects against the paler water, "If we can't find 
             it soon, we're just going to have to split up and trace 
             it back up from there." 
[22:24] * gm **Walter grins, then turns and looks hesitantly back 
             toward the north, toward the little fold of land between 
             you and the little shanty town, "Be careful with that." 

[22:24] * Vivian grins. "Who, me? ... Lead on." 

[22:25] * gm **Walter 's smile fades, "Yeah, you. I'd rather not 
             attract attention." 
[22:26] [gm] "It's still dark enough for that to be very visible."

[22:26] * Vivian pouts. "Well, OK, but how am I supposed to help you 
                 find the spring if I can't see?" 

[22:28] * gm **Walter frowns, "I said 'be careful' not 'shut it off'" 
             then turns and walks off the roadway heading down toward 
             the piers. 
[22:28] [gm] [ ----- context switches ----- ] 

[22:29] * hamilton starts slowly refilling his watergun, still singing 
                   under his breath.

[22:30] [gm] [ alex: you, hamilton and viktor are in the escape with
             sabrina in the passenger seat (I believe). You pulled the
             escape into a quick turn, briefly spoke with walter, then sped 
             back onto the frontage road. ] 

[22:32] [Alex] (correct) 

[22:33] * hamilton looks back and forth between viktor and alex. "what 
                   time does sunrise happen around here?" 

[22:33] * gm **Sabrina inhales sharply through her teeth when the 
             escape bumps slightly back up onto concrete, but remains 
             largely silent (having been shrieking at the top of her 
             lungs until about a minute before the escape hit the dirt 
             road). 

[22:33] [hamilton] "....I'm not usually awake around then." 

[22:34] * Alex responds with the exact time of sunrise this morning, 
               as given to him by the local surf report call service. 

[22:34] [hamilton] "ah."

[22:35] [gm] [ Alex reponds with a prompt, "6:37." ] 

[22:37] * gm **Sabrina glances over at Alex, her brow furrowed, "I 
             feel like I'm going to be sick." 

[22:38] [hamilton] "fantastic." 
[22:40] * hamilton searches around for a plastic bag to give to 
                   sabrina.

[22:40] * gm **Sabrina rolls her head to face out the window into the 
             darkness, "I remember when I was 10...pappa brought a 
             kitten home, he said &lt;lapsing into an eerily accurate 
             imitation of his cadence of speech&gt; 'Mi-hija, it's up 
             to you to take care of the this little guy. If you 
             don't....' 
[22:42] * gm **Sabrina pauses, her eyes filling instantly with tears, 
             "Maybe things happen for a reason, maybe....&lt;a pause 
             as she leans forward again, arms folded over her 
             midsection&gt;...I think I'm going to scream again soon." 

[22:43] * hamilton finishes refilling his watergun and screws the cap 
                   shut, brushing away a bit of spilt holy water from 
                   his pants. 
[22:44] [hamilton] "My mom never let me get a cat. She said they were 
                   filthy animals." 

[22:44] [Alex] "Shit..." Alex fumbles at the window controls for a moment,
               and then the passenger side window begins rolling down, "If
               you're getting sick, try to do it out the window... I 
               don't care if it gets on the car, just try to get it 
               outside..." 

[22:45] * gm **Sabrina nods weakly, "Okay." 

[22:46] [hamilton] "In 6th grade, she took me to the pound to look at 
                   puppies. As if a puppy would have helped anything 
                   after... everything." 
[22:46] [hamilton] "But she said the one that I chose out was ugly and a 
                   runt, and she refused to get anything but a golden 
                   retriever." 
[22:47] [hamilton] "So we agreed not to get a dog." 
[22:48] * hamilton pulls out another water pistol and double checks 
                   the water tank. 

[22:48] * Alex doesn't appear to register either of them beyond 
               rolling down the window for Sabrina. His eyes never 
               leave the road. 

[22:49] * gm **Sabrina glances over the backseat at hamilton, then 
             looks back out the windshield, her eyes lingering on alex for 
             a second. afer a moment of silence, she asks Alex plaitively
             in spanish, "Are you mad at me, Alex?"  

[22:50] * Alex grunts in reaction, eyes never wavering from the road. 
               After a few seconds of silence, he responds, also in 
               Spanish, "No.  Don't talk... save your strength.  We'll get
               you there soon."

[22:50] * gm **Viktor shifts uncomfortably in the back seat.

[22:56] * hamilton goes back to singing under his breath, an early 
                   brian eno song. 

[23:04] * gm **Sabrina hunches forward a bit further, then speaks 
             through clenched teeth, "You look good when you're angry. 
             I bet Vivian thinks you're all hot and stuff..." Her voice 
             trails off as she hisses sharply through her teeth.

[23:07] * hamilton laughs, despite himself. 

[23:07] * Alex snorts softly, mutters a derogatory euphemism about 
               women, directed in Vivian's general direction, then 
               says in a more subdued tone, "I doubt it. I doubt she 
               really thinks about me longer than it takes to brew up 
               another vicious insult." 

[23:07] * gm **Sabrina smiles faintly 
[23:09] [gm] "Only when you're looking, mi hermano-medio." 

[23:10] * Alex finally looks away from the road to study Sabrina for 
               two seconds, then turns to look at his road, chuckling 
               tiredly, having apparently decided she's making a joke, 
               "Yeah... sure." 

[23:15] [gm] ( alex (and sure, hamilton too) make an empathy at 3x (and 
             2x since hamilton is in the backseat and has a limited 
             field of view) )

[23:15] [hamilton] [ 1 ] 
[23:15] [hamilton] [ 1 success ] 

[23:19] [Alex] (I don't think Alex really has the spare cycles to do 
               empathy on anyone... I'm going to take another 1x 
               penalty) 

[23:19] [gm] ( okay -- your call )

[23:20] [hamilton] "I fucking hope they get their stuff together in time. 
                   I'm not sure we have much time to spare." 

[23:20] [Alex] ( 2 failures) 

[23:20] * gm **Sabrina is just looking at alex unsmilingly, wincing 
             with pain, but still focused on him in the brief moment 
             when he studies her. 
[23:21] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ] 

[23:22] [Alex] (ready) 

[23:22] [hamilton] [ready] 

[23:22] [Vivian] (ready) 

[23:22] [gm] ( k ) 
[23:23] [gm] [ ...about five minutes later, she starts screaming again, 
             writhing against the restraints of the seatbelt, back 
             arched almost to an unnatural looking angle....things go 
             downhill from there.... ] 
[23:24] [gm] [ ----- context switch ----- ] 
[23:24] [gm] ( vivian, do you have any survival at all? ) 

[23:25] [Vivian] (Sur-what?) 
[23:25] * Vivian unbuttons her coat about halfway. She then lodges the 
                 bottle behind the coat, just under her breasts. This 
                 gives her a V-shaped headlamp of sorts, while leaving 
                 her hands free. She then follows Walter. 

[23:25] [gm] ( cuz I'd like to make you roll a temperate forest roll, 
             failing that, a perception roll at 2x (would have been 3x 
             but she only has her magic lamp ) 

[23:26] [Vivian] (2 successes!!) 

[23:27] [gm] [ Walter, vivian, and nate spread out 3-abreast and begin 
             walking, looking for the spring just west of the dirt road.
             They walk for about 10 minutes or so, stopping once to 
             thankfully turn away from the wind ] 
[23:28] [gm] [ They then move south a ways, where the ground dips sharply
             into a narrow little valley that runs uphill to the east ] 

[23:28] * Vivian is clearly very anxious, and keeps saying things like 
                 "c'mon" and "where is the fucking thing?" under her 
                 breath. 

[23:29] [gm] [ between gusts of moist, slightly bitter ocean laden wind, 
             vivian notices a faint glimmer to her left -- downhill. ]

[23:30] * Vivian points. "Is that it?! Please say that's it...!" 
[23:31] [Vivian] Barring a statement to the contrary from Walter, Vivian 
                 starts hustling down the hill towards the glimmer. 

[23:31] [gm] [ two minutes later, you find yourself on a little rocky 
             shelf in a shallow valley. at the east end you can see a 
             narrow, kidney shaped little pool, with a little dribble 
             of water oozing from a rocky crevice on the south side, 
             and small dribble running out of the west end where it 
             quickly soaks into the ground ] 

[23:32] * Vivian beams excitedly. "Yes! Yes!" 
[23:33] [Vivian] "One of you guys call Alex. I'm gonna start setting up." 

[23:33] [gm] [ here the wind is drastically reduced, offering some 
             solace from the chill, moist air -- but as you shiver 
             once in thankfulness, you realize that you can see an 
             edge of dark blue between the sky and the hills rising to 
             the east, emphasizing the shortness of time -- unbeknownst to
             vivian, alex is looping back on final approach.... ] 

[23:34] [gm] **Nate hesitates for second, then flicks open his cell, 
             dialing hamilton's cell.

[23:35] [hamilton] "over the city's a rip in the sky. and everything looks 
                   good tonight--" 
[23:35] * hamilton answers the phone. 

[23:36] [gm] [ Vivian -- you can hear sabrina in the background, making 
             conversation very difficult -- err yeah -- hamilton's -- 
             if Nate is making the call and not Vivian) ] 

[23:36] [hamilton] "hey." 

[23:37] * gm **Nate pauses, nonplussed for a second, "We found it. 
             Vivian's setting up." 

[23:37] [Vivian] While Nate makes the call, Vivian is finding a good spot 
                 next to the spring to draw her circle of power. 

[23:37] [gm] [ Vivian, you think the circle has to enclose the spring 
             and its pool -- but you think you brought enough 
             ingredients to do it. ] 

[23:38] * hamilton covers the mouthpiece of the phone to try to muffle 
                   Sabrina's screams. "How much more time should we 
                   stay away. I think we're going to be cutting this 
                   close either way." 

[23:38] * gm **Nate relays the question. 
[23:39] [gm] [ alex, the clock in the dash reads approx 6:20 ] 

[23:39] * Vivian looks up from where she's starting to sketch around 
                 the spring. "What the-- Now! Get them here now! 
                 There's no fucking time!!" 

[23:39] [hamilton] "Alex. We should turn back." 

[23:40] * Alex grits his teeth, and snarls back in a nasty tone, "I'm 
               already fucking pointed that way!" 

[23:40] [hamilton] "Great, then!" 
[23:41] * hamilton says into the phone. "we're on our way." 

[23:41] * Vivian turns to Walter. "Walter! Get up there by Nate's van 
                 so you can lead them down. We don't want anybody 
                 getting fucking lost." 

[23:41] * hamilton then shrugs at nobody and hangs up. 

[23:44] * gm **Walter looks at vivian, his face almost visible in the 
             pale light, "Can you spare the light?" 

[23:44] [Vivian] "Do you need it? If so, then yeah, I can deal." 

[23:45] * gm **Walter nods, holding out his hand. 

[23:45] [hamilton] to Alex or Viktor: "do you guys still have the 
                   shotguns and the crossbow?" 

[23:45] * Vivian reaches into her coat and dislodges the bottle from 
                 its resting spot. She tosses it to Walter. 

[23:46] [gm] [ walter catches the light, then turns and walks up the hill, 
             still favoring his leg, holding the light against his 
             abdomen to dim it a little bit. ] 
[23:47] * gm **Viktor looks at hamilton questioningly. 

[23:47] * Alex just shrugs, says "Dunno", shakes his head. 

[23:47] * Vivian turns to Nate, "Did you bring your flashlight?" 

[23:49] * gm **Nate nods, smiling self-consciously as he pulls the 
             light out of his coat pocket, then flicks it on. 

[23:50] [Vivian] "Whew." Vivian looks relieved. "OK. Keep it trained by my 
                 feet. I'm going to draw a magic circle around the 
                 spring." 
[23:50] * Vivian furrows her brow at Nate. "Do NOT step on anything I 
                 draw. Please." 

[23:51] * gm **Nate grins, takes a half step back, "Yes Ma'am" with a 
             hint of mockery in his voice. 

[23:51] * Vivian gives Nate a smirking half-smile and winks at him. 
                 Then she gets to work, all seriousness and 
                 concentration. 

[23:55] * hamilton anxiously double checks his waterguns and stakes 
                   again. 

[23:55] [gm] [ Vivian, you place the moss in the bowl, begin grinding 
             it, speaking the phrases of power. at first you worry 
             that it's going to be hard since the cave moss is moist 
             and a little slimy ] 

[23:56] [Vivian] (She's all intensity and desperate concentration. She tries 
                 to push thoughts of possible failure out of her mind 
                 entirely.) 

[23:57] [gm] [ but as you work it over, you feel the bowl begin to warm in
             your hands as you reach the conclusion of the first phrase
             and begin the Paths of Ra (as this paragraph was termed in the 
             book) ]
[23:58] [gm] [ you grind and chant, watching as the moss almost 
             spotaneously begins to dry out, first looking whithered, 
             then seeming to crystallize, then falling into heavy grey 
             powder. ] 
[23:59] [gm] [ you add more, and continue, the bowl contining to warm in 
             your hands almost to the point of burning as it begins to 
             glow with soft silvery light ] 
[23:59] [gm] ( okay, I'm sort of merging the two story lines at this 
             point )

[00:00] * Vivian neither smiles nor frowns, seeming utterly lost in 
                 the moment. Nate sees no indication of her
                 recognizing his continued presence (unless he loses 
                 the light). 

[00:01] [gm] [ alex, as you guys are making the final approach, hitting 
             the frontage road, sabrina abruptly subsides into quiet 
             sobs, then silence. ] 

[00:02] * hamilton spends the last five minutes of the ride half in 
                   his seat, half forward to check and recheck the 
                   dashboard clock. 

[00:02] * Alex turns his head to look at her as soon as she goes 
               quiet, eyebrows drawing down, "Shit... um... Hamilton? 
               Fuck... I don't think she's breathing." 

[00:03] [hamilton] "FUCK!" 
[00:05] * hamilton undoes his seatbelt and leans forward to check on 
                   Sabrina.

[00:06] [gm] [ Vivian, without being completely conscious of what you're 
             doing, feeling as though you've entered a well rehearsed 
             dance to music about 2 beats faster than expected, you 
             reach out and find the verbena root, slitting it along 
             its length with your index finger nail, then squeezing 
             the juices out as you begin reciting the Second Arc of 
             Set over it. ] 

[00:09] * Vivian's eyes are wide and staring, her mouth nearly 
                   expressionless, as she performs each stage of the 
                   ritual. 

[00:09] [gm] [ hamilton, you half climb over the front seat, pulling 
             sabrina up by the shoulder to check her breathing. you 
             realize that she's still alive and breathing from the 
             bubbles forming in the blood flowing from her nose and 
             mouth. it looks like she's vomited about half a pint of 
             blood down her front. ] 
[00:09] [gm] [ the reek of blood quickly fills the cab of car -- though the 
             open window quickly whisks the worst of it away. ]

[00:10] * Alex looks over again at the sound of the bubbling, bites 
               out a short, quiet, angry sounding "Shit!" 
[00:10] * Alex turns his attention back to the road, and begins very 
               quietly repeating to himself or maybe to Sabrina, "Just 
               a little further... almost there... just a little 
               further... almost there..." 

[00:12] * hamilton gurgles in his throat as he tries his best to grab 
                   at the mix in her lap and throw it out the window. 

[00:12] [gm] [ vivian, you squeeze out the pale viscous juice, and watch 
             as it hits the bowl, beginning to bubble and fume with an 
             acrid grey smoke which isn't much affected by the wind. 
             the scent is sharp and burns your nose, leaving you 
             feeling a little bit nauseated and dizzy -- but the smell 
             isn't altogether unpleasant ] 

[00:13] [Vivian] (Vivian has a fair amount of experience with substances
                 that leave her "a little bit nauseous and dizzy" -- she
                 just goes with it.)

[00:13] [gm] [ alex, as you drive, viktor leans forward and almost yells 
             in your ear, "Hurry!" while hamilton abruptly rolls up 
             sabrina's sweater, roughly pulls it over her head and 
             violently throws it out the open window ] 

[00:13] * hamilton then wraps the loosened blanket tighter around her. 

[00:14] * Alex accelerates... pushing it to the point where he spins 
               out a bit, loses control momentarily more than once, on 
               the gravel road. 

[00:15] [gm] [ Vivian, you move on to the Third Corridor of Ra, knowing 
             instinctively when to stop squeezing juice, and start 
             grinding again, feeling an ache beginning to build 
             between your temples. ] 

[00:16] * Vivian doesn't fight the ache or try to shake it off; she 
                 just goes with the flow of the power. 

[00:16] [gm] [ Alex, you have a scary moment when something heavy and 
             black comes out of nowhere and slams into the windshield 
             of your car -- you have a vague impression of leathery 
             wings, dark feathers, white white fangs and red glowing 
             eyes ] 
[00:17] [gm] [ then it bounces off to the left, leaving a head-size bloody  
             smear on the windshield and a light spiderweb of cracks 
             around the point of impact. ] 

[00:17] * Alex doesn't yell, or otherwise articulate anything... just 
               growls low in his throat. 

[00:19] * hamilton yelps and ducks before regaining control of 
                   himself. 

[00:19] [gm] [ vivian, you stand and begin to pace out the Circle of 
             Darkness, spilling out the dark greyish green sand onto 
             the ground as you walk, speaking the Ward of Set ] 
[00:19] * gm **Viktor gives out a yell, then yells to no one in 
             particular "What was that thing!!" 

[00:21] * hamilton just looks at him for a second and shrugs 

[00:22] [gm] [ Alex, as you're heading down the road, you can see the 
             combined shanty and midden heap to your left, and some 
             derelict guy with a flashlight standing by the side of 
             the road. as you get closer, you realize that it's 
             walter. ] 

[00:23] * Alex pulls up next to Walter, barks out the window, over 
               Sabrina, "Get us there, man! Get us there -now-!" 

[00:24] [gm] [ vivian, as you begin to pace out the clockwise Circle of 
             Light inside the first circle, you're distantly aware of 
             nate murmuring, "oh shit. I've never seen this before" -- 
             but you instinctively know that he's not speaking to you 
             directly ] 

[00:25] * Vivian ignores Nate, unless he becomes significantly more 
                 agitated or addresses her directly. 

[00:26] [gm] [ walter doesn't wait for alex to finish, he opens the 
             door, undoes sabrina's seatbelt, starts to lift her out, 
             then realizes his leg won't support the added weight. ] 

[00:26] [hamilton] "viktor." 

[00:26] [gm] [ walter backs off as hamilton jumps out and alex rounds 
             the front of the car ] 
[00:26] * gm **Viktor starts to exit the car, then hesitates at 
             hamilton's call.

[00:27] [Alex] When he sees Walter getting her out, Alex slams the car into 
               park, yanks up on the hand brake, yanks the keys out of 
               the ignition as he leaps out his side of the car, 
               forgetting to turn the headlights off... 

[00:27] [gm] [ Vivian, you doubt that you could stop now without severe
             and possibly *dire* consequences. ] 

[00:27] * hamilton stares at Viktor dumbfoundedly for a second, then 
                   points at Sabrina. 

[00:27] [Vivian] (The group may not react to it, or even care, but it 
                 probably dawns on them at some point that Walter's 
                 not holding a flashlight, but rather a glowing bottle 
                 of Evian.) 

[00:28] [hamilton] ( those crazy frenchies )

[00:28] * Alex sprints around the front of his car and scoops up 
               Sabrina, probably as Viktor begins getting out of the 
               car, and turns toward Walter, Sabrina cradled in his 
               arms, "Where?!" 

[00:28] * Vivian most certainly does *not* stop the ritual, then, 
                 short of being directly attacked. 

[00:29] * gm **Viktor looks at Hamilton wide-eyed for a moment, then 
             follows his gaze, nodding as he realizes what Hamilton 
             wants. He then looks offended and says stiffly, "Da, da." 
[00:30] [gm] [ Walter glances up over alex's shoulder, swears, then 
             picks up the unceremoniously dropped bottle of glowing 
             Evian as Alex lifts Sabrina out of the car. ] 
[00:36] [gm] [ Vivian, you're distantly aware of the car arriving on the 
             hill above you, realizing abruptly that you were aware 
             of its presence as it was rolling down the road to the 
             North. as you finish pacing out the Circle of Light and 
             begin chanting the Curtain of Stillness you realize that 
             you know *exactly* how far up the hills the sun is, the 
             state of the receding tide, where the moon is. it's a 
             hyperperceptivity that's almost painful -- not at all 
             pleasant ] 
[00:37] [gm] [ alex, as you turn with sabrina in your arms, the wind 
             from the ocean abruptly dies away leaving a sudden 
             startling stillness. As you follow walter down the 
             embankment, you're aware of a certain hushed 
             anticipation, feeling a sudden shuddery sensation pass 
             through your muscles ] 

[00:39] [hamilton] "fuck!" 

[00:40] * hamilton starts looking around frantically, aiming at the 
                   surroundings with his supersoaker 
[00:42] [hamilton] "hurry the fuck up, Alex" 

[00:43] [gm] [ vivian, you complete the last stanza, then turn to face 
             the water and shake out the last of the dust in the bowl, 
             watching as it settles onto the surface of the water. 
             without fully knowing why, perhaps acting on instinct, you 
             reach into your pocket and toss the quartz pebble in ] 

[00:44] * Alex is moving pretty goddamn fast for a guy with a 100 lbs. 
               limp girl in his arms. 

[00:44] [gm] [ you watch as it lands dead center -- instantly, at the 
             same instant that it breaks the rippleless surface of the 
             water, you watch as all dust, dirt, particulate matter, 
             settles immediately to the bottom, leaving the water 
             crystal clear ] 
[00:45] [gm] [ Hamilton, you flank alex with a confused looking Viktor 
             as walter leads you down the hill. there's a stillness, a 
             silence about the area that's leaving you suddenly 
             nervous and worried ] 

[00:48] [hamilton] remembering the weird bat thing, hamilton starts
                   scanning the sky as well. He looks extremely nervous.

[00:49] [gm] [ Alex, as you you're heading down the hillside, you 
             suddenly see a faint lambent luminescence spring up below 
             you and around the outcropping of stone on your left. ] 
[00:49] [gm] [ you realize that you've been moving without relying on 
             the lights for some time. you think it's almost light 
             enough to read fine print by. ] 

[00:51] * Alex will keep following Walter until he sees Vivian or the 
               pool... 

[00:55] [Vivian] As Nate watches, Vivian unbuttons her long coat, finally 
                 letting it drop. The black dress she's wearing is 
                 elegant and not overly short, but is diaphanous. 

[00:58] [gm] [ Vivian, you feel a brief upwelling of confusion, then 
             turn at the precise instant Alex rounds the corner with 
             Sabrina in his arms, led by walter, then trailed closely 
             by hamilton and Viktor, hamilton trying to watch all 
             directions at once with his supersoaker at the ready ] 

[00:59] * Vivian turns to the group. She speaks loudly and clearly, 
                 but slowly and with some apparent effort: 

[00:59] * Alex yells, which he certainly doesn't need to do, "VIVIAN! 
               Where does she go? WHERE SHOULD I PUT HER?!" 
[00:59] [Alex] (and gets cut off) 

[00:59] [gm] [ the car group rounds the edge of the rock outcropping to 
             see vivian watching you in the stillness of the chill 
             morning....yeah, then alex yells.... ] 

[01:01] [Vivian] "Do NOT disrupt the circle! Alex, Hamilton, get her 
                 undressed. I need to ... get something." 

[01:01] * gm **Walter stands aside, clearly favoring his injured leg 

[01:02] * Vivian then pulls off her boots and, dress and all, slides 
                 into the spring. 

[01:02] [Alex] "What?!" He looks down at the body in his arms without seeing 
               her, then bites out a curse before laying her as gently 
               as possible on the ground. "Hamilton? God... you do it. 
               I can't... it's just..." 

[01:02] * hamilton hands the supersoaker to viktor and goes to help 
                   Alex. 
[01:03] * hamilton pauses at Alex's statement. 

[01:03] [Vivian] (How deep is the spring? If at all possible, she's going 
                 to try to retrieve the quartz.) 

[01:03] * hamilton then looks him in the eyes and clasps his shoulder. 
[01:04] * hamilton pulls the second supersoaker out of his bag and 
                   hands it to Alex, saying, "I think they're coming, 
                   whatever they are." 

[01:04] * Alex stares up at Hamilton with a wild look in his eyes. 
               Then whispers a quiet, "Please... quickly." 

[01:05] * hamilton then kneels down to undress Sabrina, mostly looking 
                   away at the ground and with a glassy expression on 
                   his face. 

[01:05] * Alex takes the supersoaker, his crazy expression slowly 
               resolving into cold, steely anger. "Good. I'll fuck 
               their shit up." And with that, he turns to start 
               walking a perimeter. 

[01:07] [gm] [ hamilton works as quickly as he can, stripping sabrina's 
             clothes, slightly hampered by her nearly-skin-tight 
             jeans and hesitating over the blood soaked tshirt. she's 
             totally limp, which helps somewhat. ] 
[01:11] [gm] [ vivian, you step into the spring, feeling the pebbly mud 
             at the bottom with your bare feet. the water is 
             shockingly cold, but strangely charged. as you step into 
             the water, you feel a tingle, then a shiver which spreads 
             up from your feet, over the surface of your skin, to the 
             top of your scalp. ] 
[01:12] [gm] [ leaving your feeling hypersensitive, as though novocaine 
             spontaneously wore off from all over your body. you 
             realize that you've sunk to your navel, perhaps a little 
             deeper. you wait, feeling a rising expectancy as dawn 
             approaches. ] 

[01:13] * Vivian quickly scans the floor of the spring, looking for 
                 the quartz. If it's hopelessly lost amongst the other 
                 pebbles, she'll give up on it. 

[01:14] [gm] [ vivian, you're vaguely aware that you should be looking 
             for something, but can't seem to bring yourself to 
             concentrate ] 
[01:15] [gm] [ as dawn approaches, you realize that it's time to 
             continue ] 

[01:16] * Vivian rises up from the center of the spring and faces the 
                 group. Her soaking wet dress clings to her like a 
                 second skin. She takes a deep breath and starts 
                 snapping out orders. "Alex! Carry Sabrina into the 
                 spring and hold her up. Hamilton, you come in too; 
                 you're going to help Alex. Nate, Walter, Viktor -- 
                 form a perimeter and make sure no nasties attack us. 
                 OK!" 

[01:17] * gm **Walter nods grimly 

[01:17] [Vivian] "And no one, NO ONE, disturb the circle!" 

[01:18] [gm] [ gm pauses for stragglers: let me know when to go on. ] 

[01:18] [Vivian] (ready) 

[01:18] [Alex] (er... should I respond first?) 

[01:18] [gm] ( ideally, yes ) 

[01:18] * hamilton tugs Sabrina's last sock off, then pulls her up 
                   with her arm over his shoulder. 
[01:19] [hamilton] and starts moving into the pool. 

[01:19] [gm] [ hamilton, with a shock you realize that you can't ] 
[01:19] [gm] [ it's like you can't summon the will to ] 

[01:20] * Alex turns and scowls down at Vivian, then walks back around 
               toward Sabrina, lips compressed into a thin, bloodless 
               line. He steps up next to Sabrina, crouches, and 
               attempts to pick her up, fireman carry style. 

[01:20] [gm] [ hamilton, you try to take a step over the threshold, but
             can't seem to find a suitable place to put your foot ] 

[01:21] * hamilton stares at the ground, confusion and sadness 
                   spreading over his face and posture. 

[01:21] * Vivian stands very straight, arm outstretched towards Alex 
                 and Sabrina, waiting for them to come in. She furrows 
                 her brow as Alex can't seem to find purchase. 
                 "Alex?!" 

[01:23] [hamilton] [ can I try to force myself over the line with a 
                   willpower check? ] 

[01:23] [Alex] (oy) 

[01:23] [hamilton] [ or push Alex, since he's taken Sabrina? ] 

[01:24] [gm] ( okay, wait. you guys are getting ahead of me. ) 
[01:26] [gm] [ alex you approach after vivian calls out, arriving as 
             hamilton stands, cradling sabrina in his arms and tries 
             to step over the threshold. Hamilton pauses for a second, 
             looking for a place to step down but seemingly unable to 
             find a good foothold. ] 

[01:27] [Alex] "Hurry!" 

[01:35] [Vivian] Vivian's eyes widen, then narrow. She points to a very 
                 specific spot. "Hamilton! Let Alex hold Sabrina. You 
                 need to come through the circle right where I'm 
                 pointing. Come just inside the circle, and stand 
                 facing me." 

[01:36] [gm] [ vivian points to the western end of the kidney shaped 
             spring, hamilton ] 

[01:37] * hamilton follows her instructions 

[01:38] [Vivian] Once Hamilton stands where he ought to, Vivian faces Alex. 
                 "Alex! While holding Sabrina, come through the circle 
                 right where I'm pointing. Then bring her over to me." 
[01:38] [Vivian] "The rest of you boys need to stay OUT of the circle. 
                 Sorry, that's the way it has to be." 

[01:39] * Alex follows as closely to the instructions as possible, 
               teeth clenched and visible through drawn back lips. 

[01:40] * Vivian meets Alex halfway between the center of the pool and 
                 the Eastern point where he entered. She looks in his 
                 eyes, and seems to tremble slightly. Then her mien 
                 shifts utterly, and she focuses all of her attention 
                 and energy on Sabrina. 

[01:40] [gm] [ okay, alex you cradle Sabrina in your arms, then walk 
             around to the eastern side of the pool as hamilton walks 
             around the other side. hamilton, you step into the pool, 
             easily finding a way over the circle into faintly 
             luminescent water ] 

[01:43] * Alex stiffens noticeably, bloodshot eyes going wide, mouth 
               opening slightly... "Viv... ian?" 

[01:47] * Vivian rolls her eyes up again to look at Alex. If four 
                 years of heartbreak and desire can be compressed into 
                 one brief look, that's what he sees. Then, with tears 
                 welling up in her eyes, she sets her jaw and looks at 
                 Sabrina, and only Sabrina, as she starts to anoint 
                 her with water from the spring. 

[01:48] [gm] [ time seems to strech out vivian, as you stand, awaiting 
             the proper moment. Alex, vivian looks REALLY GOOD mostly 
             naked in that chilly, chilly water ] 

[01:48] * Alex just stares at her for a second, seemingly having 
               forgotten his ward, his mouth opens just a little more, 
               not gaping, just open... And then he blinks, snaps his 
               mouth shut, and looks down at Sabrina, all barely 
               contained anger and anxiety again. 

[01:48] * hamilton groans, looking around everywhere but at the other 
                   people in the pool. Tears start to roll down his 
                   face as his gaze settles on his own hands. 

[01:48] [gm] [ one detail to note -- as soon as alex steps into the 
             water, you see what look like trails of inky blackness 
             begin to curl away from him under the water, ] 
[01:49] [gm] [ as though a fountain pen leaked into his clothes just before 
             he stepped into the water ]

[01:49] [Alex] (ehhhh... that ain't right) 

[01:50] * Vivian ignores it, focusing on the ritual and waiting for 
                 the Right Moment. 

[01:52] [gm] [ the group of you in the pool are aware of some loud 
             scuffling noises and shouting, but for the moment are 
             completely absorbed in the ritual. ] 
[01:53] [gm] Alex, as you stand, feeling less shivery, you feel sabrina stir 
             faintly in your arms, her slight weight almost forgotten 

[01:53] [Alex] (She's practically weightless if she's at all submerged) 

[01:54] [gm] [ Vivian stands, feeling the Moment approaching, as the sun 
             is almost ready to top the rise across from you. ] 

[01:56] * Vivian waits for the Moment, letting her connection to the 
                 spring, to the sun, to Sabrina, to Hamilton, to Alex 
                 wash through her -- preparing to take that Moment 
                 when it arrives. 

[01:57] * Alex turns his face toward the sun as it approaches the 
               horizon, eyes falling closed as the avalanche of 
               sensations and his own exhaustion begin to take hold on 
               his brain. 

[01:58] [gm] [ Alex, you glance down at sabrina, focusing on her face, 
             blocking out everything else. Her eyes open, and she 
             gazes up at him blankly for a second, then smiles, 
             looking as though her 8 year old personae was 
             superimposed over her more adult features as she 
             whispers, "Dying here like this would be okay...", then 
             her eyes close ] 
[01:59] [gm] [ Vivian, the Moment arrives, and you surprise yourself 
             when you first dunk youself under the water, then stand, 
             feeling the water streaming over your shoulders ] 

[01:59] * Vivian goes with it, letting the Moment carry her where it 
                 will. 

[02:00] [gm] [ hamilton, you anchor yourself as you realize that 
             Something Is About To Happen ] 
[02:01] [gm] [ vivian, you stand, step toward sabrina, reaching 
             instinctively toward her, when you realize that the pebble 
             is in your fist -- with only vague recollections of having 
             reached down and picked it up while you were dunking 
             yourself ] 
[02:02] [gm] [ vivian, sabrina appears to be unconscious in alex's arms ] 

[02:02] [hamilton] tears continue to steam down hamilton's face, but he 
                   looks up and stares at Alex with a mix of emotions 
                   on his face. 

[02:03] * Vivian lets a smile wash over her face. She places the 
                 pebble in Sabrina's mouth, holding it there with one 
                 hand so she doesn't swallow it, and continuing the 
                 ritual with the other. 

[02:11] [gm] [ Vivian, as you stand and then approach sabrina, you're 
             aware that alex and hamilton have begun intoning the 
             Melody of Rebirth -- how you know this, you're not sure -- but
             Alex begins and Hamilton follows, at first with his own 
             song, then blending with the music. ] 

[02:12] * Vivian lets go of the pebble and bathes Sabrina with both 
                 hands, letting the song's rhythm dictate her own. 

[02:13] [gm] [ the two blend, then begin to blend into complex harmonies 
             as the words fall away from hamilton's song ] 
[02:14] [gm] [ the notes echo off the rock walls and the water, the 
             waves of the ocean forming a sort of natural counterpoint 
             as the vibrations deepen, then expand, bringing power into 
             deeper and deeper focus ] 
[02:15] [gm] [ vivian opens sabrina's mouth, places the pebble under her 
             tongue, drops her hand to sabrina's chest, just over her 
             breasts, pauses a moment, then says quietly, her voice 
             seeming hyperreal with everything else fading to 
             surreality as she intones, "Now." and pushes down on 
             sabrina's chest just as the song rises to a cresendo at
             the exact instant the sun breaks over the hills. ] 

[02:17] [gm] [ alex, you feel Vivian push down -- the water turns 
             instantly black -- black as cancerous pitch, losing its 
             luminescence. sabrina is dunked, and held under for the 
             space of 3 long breaths as her limbs begin to thrash 
             weakly. ] 

[02:18] * Alex watches with a sort of steely, resolved determination 
               and little else, eyes fixed unflinchingly on her 
               silhouette beneath the water. 

[02:20] [gm] [ alex stares at water black as tar, looking like crude 
             oil, surprising you with its lack of viscosity...then 
             Vivian releases the pressure, and Sabrina surfaces, 
             gasping. She gives one weak cry, then begins sobbing, 
             folding into alex's chest. ] 

[02:20] * Alex wraps his arms around her, pats her gently on her back, 
               then looks at Vivian with questioning eyes and brows. 

[02:20] [gm] [ and like a switch, the power is gone, the arousal fading 
             into the pitchy black water ] 

[02:22] * hamilton sinks into the water, holding his breath and 
                   submerging for the next minute or so. 

[02:22] [gm] [ the three of you are left standing in filthy black water, 
             in a chilly, windy Northern California morning. ] 

[02:22] * Vivian shivers suddenly, hugging herself. Her eyes are very 
                 wide, and her mouth is a small 'o.' She staggers, 
                 then turns to where Hamilton submerged. "H... 
                 Hamilton?" 

[02:23] * Alex chuckles suddenly, softly, hugging Sabrina tighter for 
               warmth, and says softly, "I think he's... he's basking 
               in the afterglow... let 'im be, hmm?" He smiles broadly 
               at Vivian, unreservedly. 

[02:23] * gm **Sabrina clutches weakly at alex's clothes, still 
             weeping.
[02:24] [gm] [ suddenly, it's very, very quiet. the area smells vaguely 
             of blood, sewage, and crude oil ] 

[02:24] * Vivian stumbles over to where Hamilton submerged, trying to 
                 grab hold of his clothes, or his hair, to pull him 
                 up. 

[02:25] * Alex barks out a quiet, laugh, then begins "collecting" 
               Sabrina. He turns, walking out of the pool with her in 
               his arms, toward her clothes... then starts looking 
               around for the others... 

[02:26] [Vivian] (Does Hamilton come up for air, or do I need to roll 
                 unarmed combat to yank him up?) 

[02:26] * hamilton pushes her away when he feels her, but comes up. 

[02:26] [gm] [ the filty black water streams over his face and chest as 
             he stands ] 

[02:28] * Vivian scowls at Hamilton, but she's too tired to give it 
                 any real venom. "You big dope! Let's get out of here, 
                 it's ... um ... really fucking gross, ew!" 

[02:28] [gm] [ a rattle of pebbles and a small puff of dust announces 
             walter's arrival. If anything he looks more beat up than
             before, with a big ragged gash in his cheek, blood and dust
             covering his chest ] 

[02:29] * Alex eyes Walter quietly as he sets Sabrina down on her 
               clothes, "Do we have a coat? A towel? She's freezing." 
               He's quiet, confident, and sounds like they have all 
               the time in the world. 

[02:30] [gm] [ walter stares blankly at alex for a second, then stares 
             down at sabrina equally blankly, then abruptly his jaw 
             clenches as he turns quickly away, "Yeah. In the van." ] 

[02:32] * gm **Walter pauses for a second, then begins the climb back 
             up -- he stops abruptly, shakes his head, then points to 
             the south, "Lets go this way a bit first." He glances up 
             into alex's eyes, a warning glint clearly visible. 

[02:33] * Vivian stares at Hamilton until she suddenly shivers quite 
                 violently. She puts out a hand for him. "Come on. 
                 Let's... go home." 

[02:33] [gm] [ Alex, sabrina is indeed shivering violently -- you're 
             shivering yourself, and you're probably a little more 
             used to cold from your swimming training. ] 

[02:34] * Alex arches his eyebrows questioningly, nods, collects 
               Sabrina's clothes, then helps her to her feet, if she 
               can stand... 

[02:34] * gm **Walter wrinkles his nose, "leave 'em -- I'll buy her 
             new myself." 

[02:35] * hamilton stares at vivian's hand for a little bit, then 
                   grabs it for a second before letting go and 
                   climbing out of the pool. 

[02:35] * Alex blinks, then nods, letting the clothes drop before he 
               tries to help Sabrina to her feet. 

[02:36] * Vivian looks puzzled, and a little hurt. She reaches her 
                 hand up to Hamilton. "Um... a little help, here, big 
                 guy?" 

[02:36] [gm] [ alex, at this point, you're still carrying her, cradling 
             her against yourself in the early dawn light. ] 

[02:37] * hamilton stares at her hand again as wheels slowly crank in 
                   his head, then he takes it and helps her out of the 
                   water. 

[02:38] * Vivian keeps Hamilton's hand clasped in hers. "My foot's 
                 killing me, and I'm -- so -- tired... could you help 
                 me to the van? 'n help me get my stuff? Please?" She 
                 looks up at him, wide-eyed and earnest. 

[02:39] * hamilton looks around. 
[02:40] [hamilton] "I think we're going away from the van for a while." 

[02:40] [gm] [ you're standing in a narrow little valley near the 1, over 
             a polluted little kidney shaped pool of water with a pile 
             of bloody clothes next to it. ] 
[02:41] [gm] [ you all note that walter has a blood-dripping machete in 
             his right hand, and that he's soaked up to his elbow ] 

[02:41] * Alex prepares to follow Walter... 

[02:41] [hamilton] [ his expression closes off even more, but he helps 
                   her walk to catch up with Alex and Walter. ] 

[02:42] [gm] [ barring any interruptions, you walk south a little ways 
             in the chilly moist breeze, then turn and walk east up a 
             milder slope to the dirt road ] 

[02:42] * Vivian follows Hamilton's gaze. She stares at the polluted 
                 pool. "God! I was in THAT?" Then she notices Walter. 
                 "Oh, my God! Walter?!" Vivian looks quite dazed and 
                 confused as Hamilton helps her along. 

[02:42] * Alex just laughs again, softly, this time with a faint hint 
               of hysteria. 

[02:44] [hamilton] [ as they catch up, Hamilton gestures that he'll take 
                   Sabrina. ] 

[02:44] [gm] [ you see the van parked facing back up the road, its 
             emergency blinkers still going. The little gaggle 
             approaches it, walter limping heavily in the lead (with a 
             nearly naked vivian, a naked sabrina cradled in alex's arms, a 
             blood soaked walter making the group stand out even more) ] 

[02:45] * Alex smiles beatifically at Hamilton, nods, and gently 
               passes her over to him, bending his head down to kiss 
               her gently on the forehead. He says nothing. 

[02:45] [gm] [ as you approach the van, walter slides the side door 
             open, "We need to get out of here." ] 

[02:45] [Vivian] (Is Sabrina awake or sleeping?) 

[02:46] [gm] [ sabrina is mostly unconscious. she resist slightly being 
             passed to hamilton, murmurs softly, then passes out, in 
             mid shiver ] 
[02:46] [gm] [ after opening the door of the van, walter leans against 
             the frame, letting the machete slip to the ground. ] 

[02:47] * Vivian looks to Alex, to Sabrina, and to Hamilton, as 
                 Sabrina gets passed. "How -- how is she?" she asks 
                 the two men. 

[02:47] * Alex nods to Walter, scowls at the dropped machete. But he 
               turns and offers Vivian his hand, smiling again. 

[02:47] * hamilton just nods at her and tries unsuccessfully to smile. 

[02:48] * Vivian looks at Alex, and looks confused. Then she looks at 
                 Hamilton, and looks hurt and confused. Then she looks 
                 back at Alex, looks VERY confused, but takes his 
                 hand, tentatively returning his smile. 

[02:49] [Alex] "She's fine, I think... thanks to you. She..." Alex steps 
               towards her, bloodshot eyes still somehow glittering 
               emeralds in the dawn light. "Thanks to you..." He 
               squeezes her hand, then reaches out to pull her into 
               his arms, hugging her tight enough to make it hard to 
               breathe... 

[02:49] * hamilton puts Sabrina in one of the back seats, looking for 
                   a blanket or coat to wrap around her. 

[02:50] * Vivian struggles briefly, says "Hey! You -- masher, um..." 
                 Then she accepts the hug, and even hugs him back. 

[02:50] * Alex kisses her forehead, like he did to Sabrina, gently... 
               and then, with the faintest sob, so quiet Vivian's not 
               even sure she heard it, his mouth is suddenly pressed 
               hard against hers... 

[02:50] [gm] [ hamilton, you find a blanket in the back of the van, 
             which you unfold, and put over sabrina -- it's a little 
             apalling how severely marked up she is -- even 
             considering how long she's been liberated from the 
             redcaps ] 

[02:51] * Vivian's eyes pop WIDE open, like saucers. She smacks Alex
                 on the shoulders a couple of times... then her eyes 
                 close, and she melts into the kiss. 

[02:52] * Alex kisses her well... desperately... like a man starving 
               and she his food... and he's -much- better than he ever 
               was when they were together. And then, suddenly, she's 
               held at arms length as he stares at her, eyes wide and 
               wild looking. And yet he seems not at all surprised. 

[02:53] * hamilton climbs into the back of Nate's van and pretends 
                   he's dead. 

[02:54] [gm] [ walter just stands, staring off into the middle distance 
             as hamilton climbs in past him and settles into the 
             back. ] 

[02:55] * Vivian stares back at Alex, her eyes wide and wild, matching 
                 his. She starts trembling, nude and shaking. Then she 
                 starts crying. While crying, she whispers to Alex, 
                 "What -- what are you doing?" 

[02:56] [Alex] "I... I don't... I..." He stares at her a moment, obviously 
               confused, and then says in a resigned voice, "Thanking 
               you?" 

[02:57] * Vivian stares at Alex blankly "Th-- thanking me?" She stares 
                 at him, like he just said, "Channeling blue aliens 
                 from the planet Gorex?" Then she blinks, and shakes 
                 her head, and tries to pull away from him. 

[02:58] * Alex scowls suddenly, tightens his grip on her, and pretty 
               much manhandles her into the car. He says nothing and 
               won't for a long time. 

[02:59] [gm] [ this seems like a (wonderfully horrible) place to break ]
