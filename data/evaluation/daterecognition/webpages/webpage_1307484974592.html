          Justice BRENNAN, delivering the OPINION of the Court (below): In enacting 
          the prohibition against racial discrimination in Title VII, Congress' 
          primary concern was with the plight of the Negro in our economy. The 
          crux of the problem was to open employment opportunities for Negroes 
          in occupations which have been traditionally closed to them. It would 
          be ironic indeed if a law, triggered by a Nation's concern over the 
          results of centuries of racial injustice, prohibited all voluntary, 
          private, race-conscious efforts to abolish traditional patterns of racial 
          segregation and hierarchy. We hold that Title VII does not prohibit 
          such race-conscious affirmative action plans. </b></font></p>

          joined by Chief Justice BURGER: The operative sections of Title VII 
          prohibit racial discrimination in employment simpliciter. A provision 
          allowing preferential treatment of minorities would have to have been 
          an exception, express or implied, to the statute's explicit ban on racial 
          discrimination. There is no such exception in the Act. And a reading 
          of the legislative debates concerning Title VII, in which proponents 
          and opponents alike uniformly denounced discrimination in favor of, 
          as well as discrimination against, Negroes, demonstrates clearly that 
          any legislator harboring an unspoken desire for such a provision could 
          not possibly have succeeded in enacting it into law. </font></b></font></p>

          </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Challenged 
          here is the legality of an affirmative action plan - collectively bargained 
          by an employer and a union - that reserves for black employees 50% of 
          the openings in an in-plant craft-training program until the percentage 
          of black craftworkers in the plant is commensurate with the percentage 
          of blacks in the local labor force. The question for decision is whether 
          Congress, in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 
          as amended, 42 U.S.C. � 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> left employers and unions 
          in the private sector free to take such race-conscious steps to eliminate 
          manifest racial imbalances in traditionally segregated job categories. 
          We hold that Title VII does not prohibit such race-conscious affirmative 
          action plans. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>I 
          </b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In 1974, petitioner 
          United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and petitioner Kaiser Aluminum 
          & Chemical Corp. (Kaiser) [198] entered into a master collective-bargaining 
          agreement covering terms and conditions of employment at 15 Kaiser plants. 
          The agreement contained,<i> inter alia,</i> an affirmative action plan 
          designed to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalances in Kaiser's then 
          almost exclusively white craftwork forces. Black crafthiring goals were 
          set for each Kaiser plant equal to the percentage of blacks in <a name="text1"></a>the 
          respective local labor forces. To enable plants to meet these goals, 
          on-the-job training programs were established to teach unskilled production 
          workers - black and white - the skills necessary to become craftworkers. 
          The plan reserved for black employees 50% of the openings in these newly 
          created in-plant training programs. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">This case arose 
          from the operation of the plan at Kaiser's plant in Gramercy, La. Until 
          1974, Kaiser hired as craftworkers for that plant only persons who had 
          had prior craft experience. Because blacks had long been excluded from 
          craft unions,<a href="#note1"><b>1</b> </a>few were able to present 
          such credentials. As a consequence, prior to 1974 only 1.83% (5 out 
          of 273) of the skilled craftworkers at the Gramercy plant were black, 
          [199] even though the work force in the Gramercy area was approximately 
          39% black. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Pursuant to the 
          national agreement Kaiser altered its craft hiring practice in the Gramercy 
          plant. Rather than hiring already trained outsiders, Kaiser established 
          a training program to train its production workers to fill craft openings. 
          Selection of craft trainees was made on the basis of seniority, with 
          the proviso that at least 50% of the new trainees were to be black until 
          the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in the Gramercy plant approximated 
          the percentage of blacks in the local labor force. See 415 F. Supp. 
          761, 764. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a name="text2"></a><a name="text3"></a>During 
          1974, the first year of the operation of the Kaiser-USWA affirmative 
          action plan, 13 craft trainees were selected from Gramercy's production 
          work force. Of these, seven were black and six white. The most senior 
          black selected into the program had less seniority than several white 
          production workers whose bids for admission were rejected. Thereafter 
          one of those white production workers, respondent Brian Weber (hereafter 
          respondent), instituted this class action in the United States District 
          Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The complaint alleged 
          that the filling of craft trainee positions at the Gramercy plant pursuant 
          to the affirmative action program had resulted in junior black employees' 
          receiving training in preference to senior white employees, thus discriminating 
          against respondent and other similarly situated white employees in violation 
          of �� 703 (a)<a href="#note2"><b>2</b></a> and [200] (d)<a href="#note3"><b>3 
          </b></a>of Title VII. The District Court held that the plan violated 
          Title VII, entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff class, and granted 
          a permanent injunction prohibiting Kaiser and the USWA "from denying 
          plaintiffs, Brian F. Weber and all other members of the class, access 
          to on-the-job training programs on the basis of race." App. 171. A divided 
          panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding 
          that all employment preferences based upon race, including those preferences 
          incidental to bona fide affirmative action plans, violated Title VII's 
          prohibition against racial discrimination in employment. 563 F.2d 216 
          (1977). We granted certiorari. 439 U.S. 1045 (1978). We reverse.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>II 
          </b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We emphasize at 
          the outset the narrowness of our inquiry. Since the Kaiser-USWA plan 
          does not involve state action, this case does not present an alleged 
          violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
          Further, since the Kaiser-USWA plan was adopted voluntarily, we are 
          not concerned with what Title VII requires or with what a court might 
          order to remedy a past proved violation of the Act. The only question 
          before us is the narrow statutory issue of whether Title VII <i>forbids 
          </i>private employers and unions from voluntarily agreeing upon bona 
          fide affirmative action plans that accord racial preferences in the 
          manner and for the purpose provided in the Kaiser-USWA plan. That question 
          was [201] expressly left open in <i>McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. 
          Co</i>., 427 U.S. 273, 281 n. 8 (1976), which held, in a case not involving 
          affirmative action, that Title VII protects whites as well as blacks 
          from certain forms of racial discrimination. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Respondent argues 
          that Congress intended in Title VII to prohibit all race-conscious affirmative 
          action plans. Respondent's argument rests upon a literal interpretation 
          of 703 (a) and (d) of the Act. Those sections make it unlawful to "discriminate 
          . . . because of . . . race" in hiring and in the selection of apprentices 
          for training programs. Since, the argument runs,<i> McDonald v. Santa 
          Fe Trail Transp. Co</i>.<i>,</i> supra, settled that Title VII forbids 
          discrimination against whites as well as blacks, and since the Kaiser-USWA 
          affirmative action plan operates to discriminate against white employees 
          solely because they are white, it follows that the Kaiser-USWA plan 
          violates Title VII. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Respondent's argument 
          is not without force. But it overlooks the significance of the fact 
          that the Kaiser-USWA plan is an affirmative action plan voluntarily 
          adopted by private parties to eliminate traditional patterns of racial 
          segregation. In this context respondent's reliance upon a literal construction 
          of �� 703 (a) and (d) and upon <i>McDonald </i>is misplaced. See <i>McDonald 
          v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., supra</i>, at 281 n. 8. It is a "familiar 
          rule, that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not 
          within the statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the intention 
          of its makers."<i> Holy Trinity Church v. United States</i>, 143 U.S. 
          457, 459 (1892). The prohibition against racial discrimination in �� 
          703 (a) and (d) of Title VII must therefore be read against the background 
          of the legislative history of Title VII and the historical context from 
          which the Act arose. See <i>Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research 
          Group</i>, 426 U.S. 1, 10 (1976);<i> National Woodwork Mfrs. Assn. v. 
          NLRB</i>, 386 U.S. 612, 620 (1967); <i>United States v. American Trucking 
          Assns.</i>, 310 U.S. 534, 543-544 (1940). Examination of those sources 
          makes [202] clear that an interpretation of the sections that forbade 
          all race-conscious affirmative action would "bring about an end completely 
          at variance with the purpose of the statute" and must be rejected. <i>United 
          States v. Public Utilities Comm'n</i>, 345 U.S. 295, 315 (1953). See 
          <i>Johansen v. United States</i>, 343 U.S. 427, 431 (1952);<i> Longshoremen 
          v. Juneau Spruce Corp</i>., 342 U.S. 237, 243 (1952);<i> Texas & Pacific 
          R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co</i>., 204 U.S. 426 (1907). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Congress' primary 
          concern in enacting the prohibition against racial discrimination in 
          Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was with "the plight of the 
          Negro in our economy." 110 Cong. Rec. 6548 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey). 
          Before 1964, blacks were largely relegated to "unskilled and semi-skilled 
          jobs." <i>Ibid</i>. (remarks of Sen. Humphrey); <i>id</i>., at 7204 
          (remarks of Sen. Clark);<i> id</i>., at 7379-7380 (remarks of Sen. Kennedy). 
          Because of automation the number of such jobs was rapidly decreasing. 
          See<i> id.</i>, at 6548 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey);<i> id</i>., at 7204 
          (remarks of Sen. Clark). As a consequence, "the relative position of 
          the Negro worker [was] steadily worsening. In 1947 the nonwhite unemployment 
          rate was only 64 percent higher than the white rate; in 1962 it was 
          124 percent higher."<i> Id.</i>, at 6547 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey). 
          See also<i> id.</i>, at 7204 (remarks of Sen. Clark). Congress considered 
          this a serious social problem. </font></p>

          with racially imbalanced work forces to grant preferential treatment 
          to racial minorities in order to integrate. Second, they argued that 
          employers with racially imbalanced work forces would grant preferential 
          treatment to racial minorities, even if not required to do so by the 
          Act. See 110 Cong. Rec. 8618-8619 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Sparkman). 
          Had Congress meant to prohibit all race-conscious affirmative action; 
          as respondent urges, it easily could have answered both objections by 
          providing that Title VII would not require or<i> permit</i> racially 
          preferential integration efforts. But Congress did not choose such a 
          course. Rather, Congress added � 703 (j) which addresses only the first 
          objection. The section provides that nothing contained in Title VII 
          "shall be interpreted to <i>require</i> any [206] employer<i> . . .</i> 
          to grant preferential treatment<i> . . .</i> to any group because of 
          the race<i> . . . o</i>f such<i> . . .</i> group on account of" a <i>de 
          facto</i> racial imbalance in the employer's work force. The section 
          does not state that "nothing in Title VII shall be interpreted to <i>permit</i>" 
          voluntary affirmative efforts to correct racial imbalances. The natural 
          inference is that <a name="text6"></a>Congress chose not to forbid all 
          voluntary race-conscious affirmative action. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The reasons for 
          this choice are evident from the legislative record. Title VII could 
          not have been enacted into law without substantial support from legislators 
          in both Houses who traditionally resisted federal regulation of private 
          business. Those legislators demanded as a price for their support that 
          "management prerogatives, and union freedoms . . . be left undisturbed 
          to the greatest extent possible." H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st 
          Sess., pt. 2, p. 29 (1963). Section 703 (j) was proposed by Senator 
          Dirksen to allay any fears that the Act might be interpreted in such 
          a way as to upset this compromise. The section was designed to prevent 
          � 703 of Title VII from being interpreted in such a way as to lead to 
          undue "Federal Government interference with private businesses because 
          of some Federal employee's ideas about racial balance or racial imbalance." 
          110 Cong. Rec. 14314 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Miller).<a href="#note6"><b>6 
          </b></a>See also <i>id</i>., at 9881 (remarks of [207] Sen. Allott);<i> 
          id</i>., at 10520 (remarks of Sen. Carlson) <i>id</i>., at 11471 (remarks 
          of Sen. Javits);<i> id</i>., at 12817 (remarks of Sen. Dirksen). Clearly, 
          a prohibition against all voluntary, race-conscious, affirmative action 
          efforts would disserve these ends. Such a prohibition would augment 
          the powers of the Federal Government and diminish traditional management 
          prerogatives while at the same time impeding attainment of the ultimate 
          statutory goals. In <a name="text7"></a>view of this legislative history 
          and in view of Congress' desire to avoid undue federal regulation of 
          private businesses, use of the word "require" rather than the phrase 
          "require or permit" in 703 (j) fortifies the conclusion that Congress 
          did not intend to limit traditional business freedom to such a degree 
          as to prohibit all voluntary, race-conscious affirmative action.<a href="#note7"><b>7 
          </b></a>[208] </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We therefore hold 
          that Title VII's prohibition in �� 703 (a) and (d) against racial discrimination 
          does not condemn all private, voluntary, race-conscious affirmative 
          action plans. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We need not today 
          define in detail the line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible 
          affirmative action plans. It suffices to hold that the challenged Kaiser-USWA 
          affirmative action plan falls on the permissible side of the line. The 
          purposes of the plan mirror those of the statute. Both were designed 
          to break down old patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy. Both 
          were structured to "open employment opportunities for Negroes in occupations 
          which have been traditionally closed to them." 110 Cong. Rec. 6548 (1964) 
          (remarks of Sen. Humphrey).<a href="#note8"><b>8</b></a> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">At the same time, 
          the plan does not unnecessarily trammel the interests of the white employees. 
          The plan does not require the discharge of white workers and their replacement 
          with new black hirees. Cf.<i> McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co</i>., 
          427 U.S. 273 (1976). Nor does the plan create an absolute bar to the 
          advancement of white employees; half of those trained in the program 
          will be white. Moreover, the plan is a temporary measure; it is not 
          intended to maintain racial balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest 
          racial imbalance. Preferential selection of craft trainees at the Gramercy 
          plant will <a name="text9"></a>end as soon as the percentage of black 
          skilled craftworkers in the Gramercy plant approximates the [209] percentage 
          of blacks in the local labor force. See 415 F. Supp., at 763. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">We conclude, therefore, 
          that the adoption of the Kaiser-USWA plan for the Gramercy plant falls 
          within the area of discretion left by Title VII to the private sector 
          voluntarily to adopt affirmative action plans designed to eliminate 
          conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories.<a href="#note9"><b>9</b></a>

          Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, considered in<i> University 
          of California Regents v. Bakke</i>, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), contains no 
          provision comparable to � 703 (j). This is because Title VI was an exercise 
          of federal power over a matter in which the Federal Government was already 
          directly involved: the prohibitions against race-based conduct contained 
          in Title VI governed "program[s] or activit[ies] receiving Federal financial 
          assistance." 42 U.S.C. � 2000d. Congress was legislating to assure federal 
          funds would not be used in an improper manner. Title VII, by contrast, 
          was enacted pursuant to the commerce power to regulate purely private 
          decisionmaking and was not intended to incorporate and particularize 
          the commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Title VII and Title 
          VI, therefore, cannot be read <i>in pari materia. </i>See 110 Cong. 
          Rec. 8315 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Cooper). See also <i>id</i>., at 11615

          </b>Respondent argues that our construction of � 703 conflicts with 
          various remarks in the legislative record. See, <i>e. g.</i>, 110 Cong. 
          Rec. 7213 (1964) (Sens. Clark and Case); <i>id</i>., at 7218 (Sens. 
          Clark and Case);<i> id</i>., at 6549 (Sen. Humphrey); <i>id</i>., at 
          8921 (Sen. Williams). We do not agree. In Senator Humphrey's words, 
          these comments were intended as assurances that Title VII would not 
          allow establishment of systems "to<i> maintain </i>racial balance in 
          employment."<i> Id</i>., at 11848 (emphasis added). They were not addressed 
          to temporary, voluntary, affirmative action measures undertaken to eliminate 
          manifest racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories. 
          Moreover, the comments referred to by respondent all preceded the adoption 
          of � 703 (j), 42 U.S.C. � 2000e-2 (j). After � 703 (j) was adopted, 
          congressional comments were all to the effect that employers would not 
          be <i>required </i>to institute preferential quotas to avoid Title VII 
          liability, see, <i>e. g.</i>, 110 Cong. Rec. 12819 (1964) (remarks of 
          Sen. Dirksen);<i> id</i>., at 13079-13080 (remarks of Sen. Clark); <i>id.</i>, 
          at 15876 (remarks of Rep. Lindsay). There was no suggestion after the 
          adoption of � 703 (j) that wholly voluntary, race-conscious, affirmative 
          action efforts would in themselves constitute a violation of Title VII. 
          On the contrary, as Representative MacGregor told the House shortly 
          before the final vote on Title VII: <br>
          "Important as the scope and extent of this bill is, it is also vitally 
          important that all Americans understand what this bill does not cover. 
          "<br>
          Your mail and mine, your contacts and mine with our constituents, indicates 
          a great degree of misunderstanding about this bill. People [208] complain 
          about . . . preferential treatment or quotas in employment. There is 
          a mistaken belief that Congress is legislating in these areas in this 
          bill. When we drafted this bill we excluded these issues largely because 
          the problems raised by these controversial questions are more properly 
          handled at a governmental level closer to the American people and by 
          communities and individuals themselves." 110 Cong. Rec. 15893 (1964).
