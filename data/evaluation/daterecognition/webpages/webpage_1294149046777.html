	<caption><b>PULSE TYPE ENCODERS</b></caption>
	<tr>
		<td>The CT-2 controller can work with several makes of pulse type 
		encoders that produce what is called a &quot;quadrature&quot; data output stream.&nbsp; 
		While designed for the US-Digital incremental encoders, there are 
		several other manufacturers of incremental encoders whose products can be used. 
		The usage of incremental encoders for the CT-2 has been a work in 
		progress and several hardware and software changes have been made over 
		the years as we gained experience with these versatile encoders.&nbsp; 
		The greatest improvement has been the addition of the capability to use 
		the 'index pulse' that is provided with some incremental encoder models.&nbsp; 
		This provides a means to reliably reset the pulse count to the exact 
		value required by your antenna calibration, automatically in many cases, 
		or manually when necessary.<p>This capability is implemented in CT-2 
		controllers with version 2.1 or later firmware.&nbsp; This pulse is called 
		an index pulse, or Z-pulse (for Zero Pulse), or sometimes a Z-index.&nbsp; Since the 
		board was not originally designed for this, it is accomplished by using 
		the RJ11 input jack that is normally used for absolute encoders.&nbsp; 
		Thus one cannot use absolute and z-index incremental encoders together.&nbsp; 
		An add-on board is available to handle converting the index pulse 
		from TTL to RS485 levels at the encoder.&nbsp; This is designated on our
		<a target="_top" href="ordering.htm">Products</a> page as the LC485-IDX.&nbsp; For 
		assembly, wiring, and connection details see the links below.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; Our initial effort to provide index 
		pulse detection did work for many encoders, but we soon discovered that 
		there could be problems with some models, or when the encoders were 
		mounted such as to provide reverse rotation from normal.&nbsp; A change 
		in software with a corresponding board modification cured that problem,

		<p><b>Note 1: </b>The US Digital and Heidenhain encoders all produce a 
		very short pulse each time the encoder shaft passes the zero point.&nbsp; 
		To work with these encoders, the jumpers at Pad1-Pad2 (for Azimuth), or 
		at Pad3-Pad4 (for Elevation) must be removed.&nbsp; Also see notes in

	<tr>
		<td>Incremental encoders are meant to be geared to the antenna so that 
		the encoder shaft turns clockwise (as viewed from the top) when the 
		antenna turns clockwise.&nbsp; If your mounting arrangement requires 
		that the encoder shaft turn counter-clockwise when the antenna turns 
		clockwise then some special wiring is required.&nbsp; Additionally it 
		makes a difference whether you are using the index pulse or not.<p>
		If you are not using the index pulse, or if you are using US Digital or Heidenhain 
		encoders, simply reversing the A and B leads from the encoder will allow 
		the controller to count normally (positive for increasing azimuth or 
		elevation).&nbsp; This means reversing pins 3 and 5 on the wires from 
		the encoder to the RS-485 board at the encoder. (See the LC485-1 board 
		schematic and the <a target="_top" href="rj45.htm#Encoder connections">connection table</a> below the 
		schematic.)<p>
		However for BEI and Dynapar encoders, simply reversing A and B will not 
		work if you are also using the index pulse.&nbsp; In that case do not 
		reverse A and B as described above.&nbsp; Instead it is necessary to 
		change the connections in the RJ45 plug where it plugs into the RS-485 
		board at the controller.&nbsp; The A channel connections must be 
		reversed for azimuth or elevation (or both).&nbsp; To accomplish this, 
		for azimuth, reverse the wires to pins 3 and 6 at the RJ45 plug.&nbsp; 
		For elevation, reverse the wires to pins 7 and 8.&nbsp; (See the
		<a target="_top" href="rj45.htm#RS485 Converters">LC485-1 board schematic</a>.)</td>

		<td>In order to support the Z-Pulse available with some incremental 
		encoders, a modification to the CT-2 circuit board is required. 
		All new CT-2 controllers incorporate the required board modifications,

		modification is presented here.&nbsp; Note that this modification is required 
		if you have firmware version 2.10 or greater and you are using incremental encoders. 
		(See the <a target="_top" href="download.htm#Finding_Firmware_Version">download page</a> 
		for information on finding the firmware version.)&nbsp; The modification 
		effectively swaps the function of the two microprocessor I/O lines 
		called RB1 and RB4 (microprocessor pins 34 and 37).&nbsp; The two existing traces to 
		those pins must be cut and jumper wires to 'criss-cross' the connections 
		must be soldered on.&nbsp; The photo below shows the modification.<p>
