<h2 id="b9">9.  Nomenclature and Disassembly</h2>

<p>Before giving more description, I'll go through the vocabulary 
I'm using for the parts of a concertina which will come up in this 
discussion, and describe the disassembly necessary to fit baffles.</p>  

<p>A concertina consists of a small number of major components.
In the middle is the Bellows, consisting of a flexible pleated chamber  
fixed to a rigid wooden Bellows-Frame at each end.
Within each Bellows-Frame there is inserted a Reed-Pan, left or right. 
Sealed over each Reed-Pan is an Action-Box, left or right, which
is made up of an End and a Pad-Board.
The major components are held together by End-Bolts which go through the Action-Boxes 
and into nuts concealed in the ends of the Bellows-Frame, sealing the Reed-Pans between.</p>

</table>

<p>To disassemble a concertina, one removes the End-Bolts from an Action-Box 
(it's best to open up only one end at a time).  
This should be done carefully with a proper screwdriver, and working 
in a sequence such as 1-4-2-5-3-6, both for disassembly and reassembly,
by stages so as to avoid stress distortion of the components which must
seal exactly to be air-tight.  Provision 
must be made that each End-Bolt will later go back into the same nut from which 
it was removed, so some system to assure this must be adopted when the End-Bolts 
are removed (such as pushing the bolts into labeled holes in the bottom of a styrofoam
coffee cup or a block of foam).  
Once the End-Bolts are removed, the Action-Box lifts off, exposing 
the Reed-Pan within the Bellows-Frame.  The Reed-Pan can be removed from the 
Bellows-Frame by just lifting it out, usually by putting a thumb through a hole 
near the middle.</p>

<p>The two Reed-Pans hold all the Reeds, mounted on both sides of each Reed-Pan.
Each Reed-Pan has on one side (its outside) air-tight walls which divide its area up into
Reed-Chambers.  Within each Reed-Chamber are two Reeds tuned to the same note, 
one on the inside (sounds on the push) and one on the outside (sounds on the pull) 
with leather Valves to assure that only one Reed of a pair sounds at the same time.  
Every Reed is precision-mounted in an individual Reed-Frame (Reed-Shoe), 
and then these Reed-Frames are simply
pushed into dovetailed slots cut around the edge of the Reed-Pan where they are held
by friction.</p>

<p>Each Action Box consists of a flat Pad-Board which fits against
the corresponding Reed-Pan, and an End covering the Pad-Board.  
The End is a frame with a face of open fretwork
(wood or metal) through which the Buttons protrude.  
The holes for the Buttons are
&quot;bushed&quot; with a special felt, so that air leakage around the Buttons is
minimized.  In the case of metal 
Ends, a separate Bushing Board is mounted inside the metal End.
Concealed by the End, mounted on the Pad-Board,
are the Action mechanisms which use the push of a Button to permit air 
to flow through a Reed and thus sound a note.
The way this works is that the Pad-Board, as it seals against
the walls of the Reed-Chambers on the Reed-Pan, contains a small hole
positioned over every Reed-Chamber.  
Normally each hole is covered by a Pad on the end of a Lever, with a Spring 
attached to
the Lever forcing the Pad to close the hole air-tight.  The lever is
attached to the top of a post acting as its fulcrum, and then the other end
of the Lever passes through the shaft of a Button, 
so that when the Button is depressed it moves the Lever, overcoming the Spring
pressure, 
and the Lever lifts the Pad from its hole
allowing air to pass through the Reeds in
the corresponding Reed-Chamber.</p>

<p>Each Action-Box can be disassembled by removing the End from the Pad-Board.  
The End is held to the Pad Board by Retaining-Screws 
which run from the inside of the Pad-Board, 
through one to three cylindrical Sound-Posts, and into the End.  Duets  
have these Sound-Posts and Retaining-Screws located under the Palm Rest; the Retaining 
Screws are removed from the inside of the Pad-Board.</p> 

<p>To prepare to install baffles, 
one must (on each end in turn) remove the End-Bolts to separate
the Action-Box and the Reed-Pan from the Bellows, and then disassemble the
Action-Box by removing the Retaining-Screws to separate the End from the Pad-Board.
It is reasonable to take care in doing this, because all the parts are old and
difficult to replace, but there is no need for exaggerated precautions.
Concertinas were designed to be disassembled for maintenance, repeatedly,
and to go back together without needing any tedious adjustments. The parts
which are in precise alignment (e.g., the Reeds in their Reed-Frames) do not need
to be disturbed.  (For further information about disassembling and reassembling
concertinas, consult the section on 
<a href="http://www.concertina.info/tina.faq/conc-rep.htm" onClick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/offsite/www.concertina.info/tina.faq/conc-rep.htm'); "> Repair Techniques</a>
in the Concertina FAQ.)</p>




<h2 id="b10">10. How I Make Templates</h2>

<p>My first step is to make paper templates of the exact size and shape to fit 
each end.  This is the most important part of the process, and should be seen 
as the basic task.  The reason for doing this is that the precision with which 
the leather baffles are cut turns out to be of great importance--a difference 
of about 1/64&quot; (less than half a millimeter) all around can reduce the effect 
of the baffle by half.</p>

</div> <!--pictures-->

           <p class="bold italic centered">
           (Click on any small photograph in this document to see a larger version;<br>
           click &lsquo;Back&rsquo; to return to this document.)</p>

<p>To begin, I put a sheet of paper (something like heavy (24lb, 90g) laser-printing 
paper in white is ideal) down flat and lay the end on it, with the strap upward.  
I draw around the end with a pencil, and mark which point of the drawing is the 
&quot;top&quot; (away from the palm-rest).  It is unlikely that the concertina is exactly 
symmetrical, so the template must be oriented the same way throughout.  Then I 
turn the end over, and measure with a ruler the thickness of the wooden sides.  
On the paper, I measure toward the center by this distance along each edge, and 
draw a new outline within the first.  This is quite close to the inner size of 
the end.  Then I cut the template shape out of the paper.</p>  

<div class="captioned-image">
     <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/04-Cut-Template-M.jpg">
       <img src="images/04-Cut-Template-thumb.jpg" border="2" 
       alt="04-Cut-Template" width="160" height="120"></a>

     <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/07-Measure-Corners-of-Ends-M.jpg">
     <img src="images/07-Measure-Corners-of-Ends-thumb.jpg" border="2" 
       alt="07-Measure-Corners-of-Ends" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>I lay the template inside the end, making sure the top is aligned properly, 
and see how it fits.  It should just touch all the sides of the End.  If there 
are blocks glued at each point, I measure how big they are and carefully trim 
off the points of the template, and try again.  If the frame has a &quot;stepped&quot; 
profile, ordinarily the template should go inside the smallest part, flat 
against the fretwork of the end.  If the template is too big on one side, 
I carefully cut off a very slim strip along that edge (or part of it) and 
try again.  If the template is too small, I mark which edge should be wider, 
then put the template on another sheet of paper and cut a replacement a trifle 
bigger.  The aim is to get a template which just fits perfectly everywhere.</p>


<div class="captioned-image">
   <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/05-Initial-Try-of-Template-M.jpg">

     <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/06-Initial-Fit-of-Template-2-M.jpg">

       alt="06-Initial-Fit-of-Template-2" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>Next I cut out the area around the buttons.  This must be done with great 
precision, not roughly.  To accomplish this, I use a soft lead pencil 
to deposit graphite on the inside of the end.  If I am working on a metal 
end with a bushing board, I want the baffle to come up snugly against the 
outside of the bushing board.  So I rub the pencil point along the top 
outside edges of the bushing board, all the way around; then lay the template into 
the end (top and edges properly aligned) and rub with my finger along the 
edges of the bushing board; a line of graphite transfers to the paper.  I 
remove the template, and carefully cut along that line.  Then I try the 
template in the end, making sure that it settles tightly (but without stretching) 
around the bushing board.  If it does not, I mark where more paper must be 
removed, take it out and trim a tiny bit.  As before, if I cut too much, I 
just transfer the template to a new sheet of paper, cut it out a bit bigger 
where needed, and continue.</p>

       alt="10-Cut-Around-Bushing-Board" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>If I am working on an instrument with wooden ends, then there will be a 
strip of wood which surrounds the buttons in the pattern of fretwork.  I 
draw a graphite line close to the buttons, so that the leather baffle will 
overlap the wooden strip around them; very little clearance is necessary around 
the buttons.  (Later, a continuous line of bits of tape will be placed along 
this overlap, to pretty much seal the baffle around the buttons.)  Once the 
line is drawn, I insert the template, rub with my fingernail to transfer 
a pencil line, and cut along the line as above.  Lacking the bushing-board 
means that it is significantly harder to repeatedly put the baffle accurately 
in the same position.</p>

<p>I continue this until the template conforms just about perfectly to the outside 
of the bushing board (or border of the button area), and when anchored there just 
about perfectly fills the end to each of its edges and corners.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
    <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/11-Try-and-Adjust-Template-M.jpg">
     <img src="images/11-Try-and-Adjust-Template-thumb.jpg" border="2"

       alt="12-Cut-Template-Adjustments" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>There is only one more step: marking the soundposts.  The soundposts must be in 
good solid contact between the pad-board and the end if the sound is to be good.  
I forgot one time to cut holes for the soundposts, and inserted a leather baffle 
into a concertina so that the leather held the soundposts off the end--it sounded 
dreadful, choked and unmusical.  The soundposts seem to play an important role in 
the concertina's sound, perhaps by conducting some sound to the entire end.  So 
with the template in place, I mark each of the sound posts.  This I do by drawing 
a circle of pencil graphite on the inside of the end where I can see the imprint 
of each soundpost, putting in the paper template, and rubbing with my fingernail 
to transfer the graphite to the template, and then cutting the hole for each 
soundpost.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
     <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/13-Draw-Soundpost-Positions-M.jpg">
    <img src="images/13-Draw-Soundpost-Positions-thumb.jpg" border="2" 
       alt="13-Draw-Soundpost-Positions" width="160" height="120"></a>

     <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/14-Transfer-Soundpost-Positions-M.jpg">
     <img src="images/14-Transfer-Soundpost-Positions-thumb.jpg" border="2" 
       alt="14-Transfer-Soundpost-Positions" width="160" height="120"></a>

       <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/15-Cut-Soundpost-Holes-M.jpg">
       <img src="images/15-Cut-Soundpost-Holes-thumb.jpg" border="2" 
       alt="15-Cut-Soundpost-Holes" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>(If by some chance there is an existing baffle or anything else that DOES run 
under the soundposts, it would be important not to just remove this--since it is 
effectively part of the soundpost.  You'd need to remove the old baffle, 
either cut small discs from it or make replacements of exactly the same 
thickness, and glue the discs to the bottoms of the soundposts to permanently 
lengthen them.  Then when making new baffles, be sure to cut a hole so that 
the soundpost as lengthened makes solid contact between the end and the pad-board.  
I have never seen anything along this line, although I have seen cases where 
the wooden soundposts have been extended with old layers of some thin material 
glued to their accessible ends.)</p>

<p>At this point, I mark on the inside of the template:  (1) the serial number 
of the concertina; (2) Right or Left end; (3) the direction of the Top; and 
(4) which side of the paper faces into the action of the concertina (this 
last prevents wasting leather).</p>

<p>All this fiddling with every template is a fair bit of work, but it is vastly 
easier to make these precise adjustments on paper than on leather.  When 
the first template is finished, I reassemble the first end and repeat the 
process for the other end of the concertina. Once I have the two templates 
completed, I carefully preserve them.  It would not be a bad idea to laminate 
them, taking great care to cut the laminating plastic down to precisely the 
size of the paper (I've never done this).  Be sure each template is labeled 
with the serial number of the concertina, which end (left or right), which 
direction is the top, and which side faces out, which faces in.</p>




<h2 id="b11">11. How I Cut and Fit Leather Baffles</h2>

<p>Once I have proper templates made, the correct goatskin leather, and the 
correct double-sided tape, the process of making and fitting a baffle is 
straightforward.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">

       alt="20-Draw-Template-on-Leather" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>On a suitable self-healing cutting mat, I put the leather face (grained side) 
down.  I tape the template to the back of the leather, making sure that the 
inward-facing side of the template is up (in the finished baffle, the grained 
side will face out so it is visible).  With a ball-point pen (not liquid ink 
which could soak through the leather) and a straightedge, I mark the outside 
edges, and carefully draw around the holes for the button-array and for the 
sound-post(s).  Then I remove the template, and cut out the marked shape in 
the leather.  I use a craft knife, very sharp and with a sufficiently-thin 
point to easily cut the curves required.</p>

</div>

<p>If the template fits the end exactly, then when the baffle is laid into the 
end of the concertina the leather should also fit just exactly.  It is prudent 
to err in cutting on the &quot;large&quot; side of the lines, so that the exact fit can 
be achieved by trimming--leather is expensive.</p>

</div>

<p>I found that I was able to reduce the volume by a large amount only when I cut 
the leather with extreme care--meaning that I cut the template very carefully, 
then cut the leather larger by the width of a ball-point pen line, then (taking 
advantage of a bushing-board to be able to position the baffle repeatably) re-cut 
each edge (or part of an edge) separately by minute amounts, shaving each edge in 
two or three or four operations (replacing and checking the baffle after each cut) 
until the leather just exactly fit flat against the fretwork, completely filling 
the area from the bushing-board to the outside frame, but without being compressed 
against the frame.  The gap might be as little as 1/64&quot; (0.4mm) for a maximum 
amount of reduction, or 1/32&quot; (0.8mm) for an ordinary amount of reduction.  
(Much more on this below.)</p>

</div>

<p>Once the leather baffle is cut, I set it aside.  I take about six inches of the 
double-sided tape, and cut it across into 1/8&quot; strips (so each piece is 1/8&quot; 
by 1/4&quot; by 1/16&quot; thick), yielding 48 pieces.  These bits of tape I stick on 
the inside of the fretwork of the instrument.  You want to be careful not to 
put a solid line of tape bits around the outside edges--that could seal the 
end.  I put only two or three of the tiny bits along each edge, eight or ten of 
them around the button area, and the rest randomly scattered over the 
fretwork wherever it is big enough.  The black tape will be invisible after assembly 
so long as it does not project into openings; if a corner does stick out, 
I use the tip of a knife blade to cut off the projecting corner.  When all 
the bits of tape are distributed, I press them each down with a fingertip 
(on the paper liner, still in place) to be sure that they adhere.  (If the 
tape does not stick well, the inside of the concertina end may be dirty; 
it should be cleaned so that the tape will stick.)</p>

</div>

<p>In the case of a wooden-ended instrument without a bushing board, there is 
no way to cause the baffle to fit close to the bushing board to create a 
narrow slit.  So for these instruments, more tape is needed.  I cut more 
of the 1/8&quot; by 1/4&quot; bits of tape, and assemble nearly a solid line of these 
along the strip of wood outside the buttons--the part overlapped by the baffle.  
These bits don't need to be butted end-to-end, but I close up about 85% of the 
line around the buttons.  This reduces the leakage around the buttons to 
someplace close to that experienced with a bushing board--much reduced, but 
far from zero.  This may take another 48 bits of tape, for a larger
instrument.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
      <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/45-Press-Down-Tape-Bits-M.jpg">

       alt="46-Remove-Backings-from-Tape-Bits" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>Then I remove the paper liner from the tops of all the bits of tape (using 
the point of a knife, or very sharp tweezers of the sort made
for electronics assembly) to expose the top adhesive.  
Now the work becomes delicate.  I carefully position the baffle, with the 
grain-side down facing outward, and ease it toward the tape.  
If the concertina has a bushing-board, I hold the baffle with all edges 
curled slighty upward so that the cut-out for the bushing board can be precisely 
positioned first, and then let the rest fall when that is accomplished.  
If the baffle is slightly mispositioned, I try to pick up an 
edge with a knife blade and try again.  I try to avoid allowing the 
adhesive to grip the leather until it is in the correct position; but so 
long as the leather is not pressed into the adhesive, it can most likely 
be peeled away gently, certainly up to an hour or so, and in my experience 
up to 24 hours later.  The adhesive gains strength over 48-72 hours, so 
tests and adjustments should be done in the first day.  When the baffle 
appears to be in place, I reassemble the end and try it out.  If 
necessary, I can disassemble the end again and adjust it.  Pulling the 
baffle out may bring some of the bits of tape with it; if so, I carefully 
&quot;roll&quot; them off the leather with a finger, and install new replacement 
bits of tape on the end of the concertina before trying again.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">

</div>

<p>When the baffle is in final position, I then gently press the leather 
onto each of the bits of tape beneath it.  I'm careful to see that the 
fretwork of the concertina is well-supported during this--pressing in 
mid-air without support behind the fretwork could bend or break the 
fretwork of the end, or could separate the framework at one of the 
corners, both very bad events.  After this is done, the leather can 
still be removed, but most of the bits of tape will probably come out 
too; after a day or more it can still be removed from the concertina 
bringing all the tape bits with it, but when the tape is removed from 
the leather, even gently rolled off, it will most likely leave a mark 
on the leather (which will, 
however, be at least mostly under a part of the fretwork, since that's 
where the tape bits are).  The concertina should be unharmed.</p>

<h2 id="b11A">Effects of Precise Baffle Size</h2>

<p>The reduction in the sound of a concertina after baffles are installed 
seems to be extremely 
sensitive to the exact size of the leather.  The same kind of leather, 
installed in the same way, using the same double-sided tape, can reduce the 
volume in the same concertina by as little as -1 or -2 dBA (an almost unnoticeable 
reduction) up to as much as -10 or -11 dBA (half the unmodified volume level)--the 
only difference being how closely the leather is cut to fit up to the inside 
edges of the frame.  An almost-unnoticeable difference in cutting the leather 
can make far more difference in the results than I ever expected.  
(But since I made these measurements, G&ouml;ran Rahm has told me that he had also
encountered the apparently critical tolerances necessary 
to control the effects of baffles 
during related work that he did on concertina acoustics some fifteen years ago, 
and I have confidence that the observed effects are real.)</p>

<p>I found that I was able to reduce the volume by -10 dBA or more 
(a maximum reduction)
only when I cut the leather with extreme care, 
so that the leather just exactly fit flat inside the wooden edge of the end, 
completely filling the area from the bushing-board to the outside frame, 
but (important point) without being compressed against the frame.  
The gap along each edge might be as little as 1/64&quot; (0.4mm) for 
a -10 dBA reduction.</p>

<p>If I should cut a baffle just the slightest bit short of full (which can easily be 
done without intending to do so), so that I could see a tiny void between the 
baffle and the frame along each edge--about 1/32&quot; (0.8mm)--then I got a reduction 
of about -5 dBA.  And if I cut the leather so that there was about 1/16&quot; (1.6mm) 
visible between the leather and the frame, then I got a reduction of only about 
-2 dBA (almost no effect).  It is not clear why such a very small 
difference in the size of the baffle should make so much difference in the 
effect; after all, there is always air escaping through the bushing around 
the buttons, and possibly elsewhere.  But repeated experiments and measurements 
seem to show that the small difference is critical.</p>

<p>A wider gap is useful when one does NOT want to reduce the volume of the end
very much--when 
the baffle is being fitted mostly to have an effect 
on the tone and for its cosmetic appearance.  
When aiming to do this, I have had success by cutting the 
baffle to the exact size of the template, and then marking exactly 1/16&quot; off 
each edge.  After verifying that trimming this much will not leave a visible 
gap along any edge, I trim the leather by the 1/16&quot; all around.  The result 
is the appearance of a baffle, a &quot;sweetening&quot; of tone, and almost no 
reduction (-1 dBA to -2 dBA) in the volume of sound from that end.</p>

<p>When making adjustments by shaving the edges, it is easy to remove too much 
leather and produce too much air flow, so that the  volume 
is now louder than desired.   A fix which will work within limits
is to add some double-sided tape overlapping part of each 
edge--say, one or two inches in the center of each side--to reduce 
the total area of the slit, until the airflow is again lowered so that
it is the same as that of a narrower slit.</p>

<p>People worry about &quot;blocking the air&quot; when adding baffles, and sometimes 
purposely leave open areas for the air to get out/in.  This concern is 
correct, but it is important not to overestimate the area required--it is 
extremely small.</p>

<p>Consider some rough estimates.
When three keys are depressed to make a chord, that lifts the pads from three 
holes.  Each hole is about 1/2&quot; in diameter.  A round hole of 1/2&quot; diameter 
has an area of less than 0.2 square inches; three of them total less than 0.6 
square inches.   When a baffle is installed, the slit around the edge (between 
the baffle and the end all around) will be at least 20 linear inches, even on 
a small six-inch hexagonal instrument.  If it is 1/32&quot; wide, then the total 
area of that slit will be slightly larger (0.625 square inches) than the area 
of the three pad holes.</p>

<p>So, as calculated, there should be enough area for all the air through three 
pad holes to move through a 1/32&quot; slit around the outside of the baffle, 
even before taking into account leaks, or the further slit around the bushing board, 
or the bushings around the keys--all of which exist.  Even with a 1/64&quot; slit 
the area (half as much) should be ample with those additional leaks.  The slit 
has an effect on the quality of the sound--but this is apparently because of 
the geometry of the air path and the dispersal of the air all around, 
not because the air is prevented from getting in or out.</p>

<p>Of course, that slit all around does need to be there--if you close
up the slit, then you will have problems.   The bellows could become 
slightly harder to move, but before that (in my experience)
the tone will become &quot;gravelly&quot; or &quot;rough&quot; 
rather than the desired &quot;sweeter&quot;.  
I observe that (1) the rough sound will sometimes be heard 
first in a chord, even when each individual note played alone sounds 
pretty good; and (2) the same rough sound can be produced by any particular 
mechanism of closing up the slit--by using too thin a mounting tape, or by
taping all around the baffle to close the slit, or by cutting the baffle too large 
so it wedges tightly against the frame all around leaving no slit.  
My experience is that the &quot;rough&quot; effect appears very quickly.  So if I 
discover that my baffle produces this tone in a chord, then it is necessary 
to cut it VERY VERY slightly smaller--which can entail quite a lot of re-work.  
The temptation is to &quot;make sure to get it small enough&quot;, but this always 
produces a baffle which is then too small and thus fails to reduce the sound 
enough.  The &quot;gravelly&quot; or &quot;rough&quot; effect can be removed by shaving an 
almost undetectable amount off some part of the edges.  (It's important 
to remember accurately what the chords sounded like before baffles were 
added; it would be easy to mistake the naturally-strident tone of the concertina 
for an imaginary problem.)</p>

<p>Another possible symptom of too little slit area is that the concertina can be 
at pitch when played at normal pressures, but can sound lower 
in pitch (flat) when the bellows are pulled or pushed sharply.  This 
symptom varies from one concertina to another, so it seems to depend on 
the properties of some reeds, as well as on the baffle.  If 
this is the only symptom, then the amount of additional gap needed is 
even less; a tiny amount cut for 
the length of one inch on a single side should be enough.  (Again, 
diagnosing this 
requires some care, since the variation of pitch with sharp pressure is 
present to a very slight degree in many instruments even without baffles.)</p>

<p>When properly cut, even baffles with maximum effect
need not have any of these problems.  In measurements reported below,
Wheatstone #29195 was fitted with very close-cut leather baffles producing
a reduction of -11 dBA and additionally with
acoustical fabric for a total reduction on the left side of -15 dBA; it has
no rough tone, and no flatting of pitch at all on strong bellows 
movements.</p>




<h2 id="b12">12. How I Cut and Fit Acoustical-Fabric Baffles</h2>

<p>I begin with the paper templates made in the first step, the same ones used 
for the leather baffles.  As with the leather, the template is taped to 
the back of the acoustical fabric, and a ballpoint-pen line drawn with a 
straightedge along each side and corner.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT POINT: a leather baffle has its grain facing out (through the 
fretwork) and its back toward the bellows--but the fabric baffle must 
have its acoustically-active face facing INWARD toward the bellows, and 
its unattractive coated back outward toward the fretwork.  So the 
template must be put on the back of the fabric UPSIDE DOWN from the 
way it is put on the back of the leather.  Ignoring this is an easy 
mistake to make.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
     <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/29-Tape-Template-to-Fabric-M.jpg">

       alt="31-Cut-Acoustic-Fabric" width="160" height="120"></a>
</div>

<p>Unlike the case with leather, there is no need to make the 
fabric baffle to an ultra-precise size--slight variations make no 
difference in function.  The fabric will compress slightly, and 
should fill the end all the way to the edges; moreover, it can be 
held in place by friction against the edges so that no tape is 
required, another motivation to be sure that it is big enough.  
What I did was to cut out the fabric about 1/16&quot; outside the lines 
transferred from the template, along each edge and corner; 
along the edge of the bushing board (if there is one) 
I also add the same amount, but in a wooden-ended instrument with no 
bushing board I cut to the template size; around the sound-posts I cut 
to the marked size (since the fabric must be out of the way of the posts).</p>

<p>After cutting out the fabric baffle, I try it in the concertina--face 
inward.  It should be possible to push the fabric baffle in so it is 
held by its edges, and to stretch it a bit around the bushing board.  If it 
is a bit too big so that it raises or buckles, I trim it slightly 
as necessary, bit by bit (scissors work well).  My experience has been 
that such a fabric baffle can always be held in place by friction 
against the edges, with no need for any tape (but obviously, a spot 
or two of double-sided tape could be used if necessary.)  The concertina 
can be assembled and tried with the fabric in place.</p>

<p>What I have always done (apart from measurement experiments) is to use 
the acoustical fabric to line the inside of a leather baffle.  That is, 
a leather baffle is made and fitted as described above.  Then the fabric 
baffle is made as just described, and pressed into the end of the concertina 
with its back against the back of the leather baffle.</p>

<p>There is a limited space inside the end of a concertina, but I have put 
both a leather baffle and a fabric baffle liner into a number of Maccann 
Duet concertinas (with both flat and raised ends, both metal and wooden, 
of all ages) with no difficulty.  The full package is slightly more than 
one-quarter of an inch thick:</p>

<table  class="measurement-table cellspaced" align="center">
  <tr>
     <td>double-sided 1/16th&quot; tape:</td>
     <td>&nbsp;0.0625 inches</td>
     <td>&nbsp;1.6 mm</td>

     <td>leather baffle:</td><td>&nbsp;0.0400 inches</td><td>&nbsp;1.0 mm</td>

  </tr><tr>
     <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TOTAL:</td><td>&nbsp;0.2775 inches</td><td>&nbsp;7.0 mm</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This is just about equal to the available space, but ordinarily there
is no problem.  The parts of the concertina that can be interfered with
by the acoustical fabric are the action levers that connect the buttons to the pads.
Each lever is fixed to the top of a post acting as a fulcrum around which 
the lever pivots; usually this post is the highest point and it can press into
the fabric a little bit with no effect.  On a couple of instruments, though,
I have found that the high points that pressed against the fabric were not
the posts but rather some parts of the levers.  If this is true, then
when the concertina is reassembled there are two possibilities: (1) If the
highest part of the lever is on the pad side of the fulcrum, 
then it may become harder to press down the corresponding button because the lever
is hitting the fabric.  (2) If the highest part of the lever is on the 
button side of the fulcrum, then the pressure of the fabric may lift the pad very slightly,
making the note into a partly-open drone.</p>

<p>To correct this, I merely opened 
the end again and examined where the levers touched.  (If there is any 
difficulty about this, it is easy to rub a pencil lead along the tops 
of all the levers, add a piece of thin paper above them, and reassemble 
the end; when it is taken apart again, the graphite deposited on the 
paper will show which levers are being touched.)  At those places--which 
in my instruments were between the lowest buttons and 
the palm rest--I used a pair of scissors edge-wise to trim the surface 
of the acoustical fabric in that small area.  Very little trimming was 
necessary to provide the slight amount of room needed for the levers to
close the pads securely, and it made no difference to the baffle effect achieved.</p>

<p>It is worth vacuuming an acoustical-fabric baffle after cutting it, to 
remove any loose threads.  Loose threads can be later sucked into the reeds 
where they will produce the usual problems and need to be removed.</p>

<p>If sound is absorbed by a layer of acoustical 
fabric on the outside of the reeds, then it might be a good idea to put 
a layer on the other side as well, on the side of the reeds toward the 
bellows.  There is a very easy way to do this.  When you disassemble an 
end and lift out the reed-pan so as to look into the bellows, you see 
that in the corners of the bellows-frame are small blocks glued into the 
corners; these serve to reinforce the bellows-frame, and also their flat 
tops provide a set of uniform and level points on which the reed-pan is 
supported, so that its top edges are precisely leveled with the top edges 
of the bellows-frame, against which the flat side of the pad-board must fit 
perfectly.  The reed-pan must fit entirely above these blocks--so the 
rest of the area 
at the same level as the blocks is empty, as is all the area toward and 
into the bellows.  (Note that this area may be of different heights on 
different sides--if the concertina has an inclined reed-pan, it will 
protrude lower on one side.)</p>

<p>I used the same template, again, to cut an &quot;inner-baffle&quot; 
of acoustical 
fabric.  On this side, one needs merely a hexagon (or octagon, or dodecagon) 
of fabric, with no need to cut out for buttons or sound-posts.  I cut it, 
again, about 1/16&quot; larger all around than the template.  Again, the 
acoustically-active face should be towards the reeds, and the &quot;top&quot; should 
be marked so that the inner baffle can be reinserted repeatedly in the 
same orientation.</p>

<div class="captioned-image">
      <a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/37-Mark-Inside-Fabric-M.jpg">

</div>

<p>I trimmed the corners of the inner baffle so that it just fully cleared 
all the corner blocks, with not even a thread resting on a block to hold 
the reed-pan high.  It then rested against the first fold of the bellows 
(when closed), with its edges under the edges of the reed-pan.  Since it 
was a bit over-size, it sagged in the middle and I encouraged this by 
gently pushing down the middle (toward the center of the bellows).  The 
sag was about 1/2&quot; at the center.</p>

</div>

<p>On one concertina, after adding the inner baffle in this way some of the 
notes were out of tune.  After further experiments, I concluded that the 
inner baffle had not sagged enough, so that its surface was just slightly 
interfering with the vibration of the inner reeds.  I encouraged the sag 
a little bit further, by inserting the reed-pan and then poking my finger 
through the hole in its center to push the inner baffle away and toward 
the bellows.  This provided just the slight additional clearance needed, 
and the reeds all returned to being in tune when the concertina was 
reassembled.  On another concertina, there was less than usual space 
under the reedpan, so that the under-baffle interfered with the reeds 
quite a lot.  On this instrument, I put a half-inch piece of double-sided 
tape on each of the six end-sections of the bellows, and then stuck the 
under-baffle to those pieces of tape.  This held the under-bellows safely 
away from the lower reeds, except when the bellows was very nearly fully 
closed.</p>

<p>Adding the inner baffle provided a small but consistent measurable 
additional decrease in volume, half or less of the decrease provided 
by the outer &quot;baffle lining&quot; of the same fabric.  This provides 
one more tool for adjusting the relative volumes of the two ends.</p>

<p>I have tried using TWO thicknesses of acoustical fabric, all by 
themselves, both inside the end and below the reed-pan.  Two 
thicknesses of the fabric total 9mm, compared to 7mm for the 
standard combination, but I have never made the 9mm work, even 
in a large raised-end instrument.  In the end of the concertina, 
the two thicknesses 
prevent the pads from opening sufficiently; below the reed-pan, 
two thicknesses interfere with the reeds.  I've never made this work yet,
so I don't know what effect it would have.</p>

<p>With the inner layer of acoustical fabric installed inside the reed-pan, 
and the reed-pan reinstalled, all
that is left is to fit the acoustical fabric &quot;baffle lining&quot; inside 
the leather baffle already held by double-sided tape, which can ordinarily be
done by just pushing the slightly-oversized fabric into the end.  Then the
action-box is reassembled, and mounted to the bellows frame with the end-bolts.</p>

<h2 id="b13">13. How I Measure Results </h2>

<p>After many different experiments, I tested the effect of the techniques described 
above more carefully by applying all of the procedures to three different concertinas
which had not been worked on previously.</p>

<p>I measured the sound level of each end of the instruments, using a 
Radio Shack &quot;Digital Sound Level Meter&quot;.  This is a meter which has 
been sold for many years by Radio Shack, current price USD 59.95 
(GBP 42.22, EUR 68.12).  Full details below under <a href="appendices.htm#b16D">Suppliers</a>.
It is apparently often used by audiophiles 
setting up listening environments, in conjunction with CDs that contain 
standard tones and levels.  Its advantage is that it is easy to get and 
very inexpensive, and different units give very uniform results
so the measurements taken by different people using 
the same meter can be compared (and they are frequently reported to 
audiophile newsgroups on the internet).  Its disadvantage is that it 
measures only the total sound level, and does not offer the ability to 
measure the different sound levels of particular octaves (or thirds of 
octaves), so it cannot be used to help understand how the character of 
the sound is changed.  But what it does, it does reliably; it measures 
sound level, in decibels (dB), and can use &quot;A&quot; weighting for direct 
readings in dBA.  In fact, I bought two of these meters and tried both 
of them.  They were easy to use, extremely consistent in making repeatable 
meaurements, and the two meters agreed very closely.</p>

<div class="left-run-in">
<a hidefocus="true" class="image" href="images/Radio-Shack-Sound-Meter-M.jpg">
<img hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"
src="images/Radio-Shack-Sound-Meter-thumb.jpg" border="2" 
alt="Radio-Shack-Sound-Meter" width="150" height="200"></a> 
</div>

<p>My testing setup was a small room (8 ft by 10 ft), floors partly hard 
and partly carpeted, walls partly hard and partly curtained, all doors 
and windows closed.  The sound level meter was positioned on marks on a 
tabletop, pointing outward.  The concertina was held vertically in a fixed spot 
about one foot away beside the table, with the top end (being 
measured) in the focus of the sound level meter.  The desired buttons 
were depressed, and then the support for the bottom end of the concertina was released 
allowing it to fall by gravity.  This means that the sound was not nearly as 
loud as if the bellows had been pulled more energetically, but it was 
repeatable; also, the same set of reeds was measured each time.  The 
sound level meter was adjusted to &quot;A&quot; weighting, 
to a rapid response, 
and set to record and hold the maximum level experienced during the time 
after the free end of the concertina was released.</p>

<p>For the first concertina, for every measurement, the concertina was 
tested 12 times. When the left end was being measured, it was tested 
6 times playing a 3-note C chord, 6 times playing a 3-note G chord, and 
the 12 measurements averaged and rounded to the nearest whole-number reading 
in dBA. When the right end was being measured, it was tested 6 times 
playing a single C, 6 times playing a single G, and the 12 measurements 
averaged and rounded in the same way.  (Note carefully the economical 
terminology I'm using below: whenever a &quot;left-end&quot; measurement is given 
it is for a three-note chord, and whenever a &quot;right-end&quot; measurement is 
given it is for a single note; so the two ends are said to be &quot;the same 
volume&quot; when a three-note chord on the left yields the same numerical 
measurement as a single note on the right.  This is not the ordinary
meaning of &quot;the same volume&quot;.)</p>

<p>Making twelve sets of measurements in this way appeared to be an excess 
of zeal; the measurements were always clustered closely, with an occasional 
outlier.  So on the next two instruments I tried each measurement three or 
four times only, accepting the obvious value and making more measurements 
if there seemed to be any variation.</p>

<p>I'm no expert about acoustic measurements, 
but elementary books tell me that most sounds are between 30 dBA and 120 
dBA measured from three feet; quiet whispering at three feet measures about 30 dBA, 
a chainsaw at three feet measures about 117 dBA.  
(All concertina measurements were taken at one foot.)
In &quot;dBA&quot;, the &quot;dB&quot; part stands for
&quot;decibels&quot;, the unit of measurement; the &quot;A&quot; 
stands for &quot;A-weighted&quot;, meaning
that the loudness of different pitches is given more or less weight,
reflecting the way human ears perceive sound over the audible frequency range.
This weighting has been found to correspond most closely to subjective noisiness.</p>

<p>The dBA measurements are logarithmic, so they cannot be combined or compared
in the usual arithmetic way.
For combining loudnesses, one rule
is that combining two sounds of the same loudness adds +3 dBA; so if
you have one reed sounding at 90 dBA and a second reed at 90 dBA, the loudness
of both together is not &quot;180&quot; but is 93 dBA.   Combining three sounds
of the same loudness adds about +5 dBA (not 6 dBA).  So for three reeds each
measured at 90 dBA, the total sound level would be 95 dBA; and for three reeds
each measured at 80 dBA, the total sound level would be 85 dBA.</p>

<p>In comparisons, a difference of 1 dBA is generally unnoticeable. 
A difference in sound level of 2 or 3 dBA 
is said to be &quot;just noticeable&quot;.  
A difference of somewhere around 10 dBA 
is perceived to be &quot;about twice as loud&quot;.  
Because human ears are not linear, the perception of &quot;about four times as loud&quot;
is usually found at less than the 20 dBA difference that this rule would
predict, actually closer to 15 dBA.</p>  

<p>The idea that a difference of around 10 dBA is &quot;about twice as loud&quot; has 
given rise to a rule of thumb that for one sound to be &quot;clearly 
audible&quot; over other sounds, it should be about 5 dBA louder.  Applied to
my own personal goals in adding baffles to a Maccann Duet, 
this suggests that I would like to alter the sound 
produced so that the right hand (single note) is roughly 5 dBA louder than 
the left hand (three-note chord).  Whether the right hand is &quot;clearly 
audible&quot; over left-hand chords clearly depends on more than the relative 
sound levels--the right-hand melody is easier to hear if its notes are 
distinctly higher than the notes in the chords, harder to hear if the 
chords and the melody are played in the range where the two sides overlap,
for example.</p>

<p>If you assume that on an ideal concertina each and every note has exactly
the same loudness, then playing three notes in a chord on the left would
be about +5 dBA louder (just by combining the three notes) than a single
note played on the right.  This is, in fact, close to what is frequently
measured in real concertinas.  So the task at hand is to reduce the loudness
of the left side reeds enough so that combining three of them still leaves
them about 5 dBA quieter than a single reed on the right side, instead of
about 5 dBA louder.</p>  

<p>As a numerical example, 
assume that every reed--left and right--individually produces a sound 
measured as 90 dBA.  Then three reeds on the left will measure 95 dBA together
and one reed on the right will measure 90 dBA (about 5 dBA quieter).  
We need to reduce the loudness of each reed on the left side to about 80 dBA,
a reduction of 10 dBA (&quot;about half as loud&quot;).  Then the three reeds on
the left will measure about 85 dBA together and one reed on the right will
still measure the original 90 dBA (about 5 dBA louder).  This would accomplish
the particular change that I am seeking, to make the right-hand melody &quot;clearly
audible&quot; over the chords, rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>The first set of measurements was done on Wheatstone 
<a href="http://www.horniman.info/DKNSARC/SD01/PAGES/D1P0890S.HTM" onClick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/offsite/www.horniman.info/DKNSARC/SD01/PAGES/D1P0890S.HTM'); ">#27217</a> , a Wheatstone 
model 33 manufactured 26 August 1916, a 46-key Maccann Duet with nickel plated 
ends with black wood, metal buttons, and six-fold bellows.  Inside it is 
marked &quot;Repaired 1991&quot; by C. &amp; R. Dipper, and I purchased it from from 
Chris Algar.  Just to listen to it, this seems to be a suitably-representative 
metal-ended Wheatstone--very loud, and with a very loud left hand side.</p>

<p>To begin with I measured the sound unaltered, as the concertina came 
from the factory (or at least from its latest refurbishment):</p>

<div class="measurement-table shaded boxed">
<table width="100%" cellspacing="5">

<td>Wheatstone #27217, Factory</td><td>97 dBA [-00 dBA]</td><td>93 dBA [-00 dBA]</td><td>+04 dBA
</tr>
</table>
</div> <!--verysmall top1em-->

<p>This means that, measured as described above, a three-note chord on the left end 
was recorded at 97 dBA (changed by 00 dBA because no alteration has been made yet),
a single melody note on the right end was measured at 93 dBA, so the difference 
(always calculated as &quot;left minus right&quot;, but the result may be positive or negative)
is +04 dBA louder on the left side.</p>  

<p>My measurements indicate that on this concertina adding an inner layer of 
sound-absorbing acoustical fabric just on the bellows-side of the 
reeds reduced the sound by about -02 dBA.  Adding a layer on the outside, 
the end-side, reduced the sound level by -05 dBA.  Doing both results in a 
-06 dBA reduction, and hence also a 6 dBA change in the &quot;left-minus-right&quot; 
difference, from +04 dBA to -02 dBA.</p>

<div class="measurement-table shaded boxed">

</div> <!--verysmall top1em-->

<p>Next I took the acoustical fabric out, and installed just a leather baffle, 
cut close.  That reduced the sound by -05 dBA.  To my surprise, re-installing 
the acoustical fabric again had exactly the same effect as before, in addition 
to the effect of the leather.  So with all the possibilities in place--leather 
baffle, plus layers of acoustical fabric on each side of the reeds, the total 
reduction was -11 dBA.  This made the total difference between the two sides 
-07 dBA, so the right side melody was clearly audible over chords 
played on the left side.</p>

<div class="measurement-table shaded boxed">

</tr>
</table>
</div> <!--verysmall top1em-->

<p>This is what was wanted: the left side has been quieted by -11 dBA 
(which is definitely cutting its loudness in half), leaving the right side 
very clearly audible over the left.</p>

<p>But there are two reasons for wanting to go further and to install a leather 
baffle on the right side as well.  First, it would be nice to have some of 
the &quot;sweetening&quot; effect on the right side as well.  Second, for cosmetic 
reasons it looks nice to have what are apparently the same kind of baffles 
on both sides.</p>

<p>I started by installing the same kind of leather baffle on the right:</p>

<div class="measurement-table shaded boxed">
<table width="100%" cellspacing="5">
<tr>
<td>(Installed on Left Side)</td>
</tr><tr>

</tr>
</table>
</div> <!--verysmall top1em-->

<p>So, when I fitted a full-sized leather baffle on the right side, I 
produced the predicted effect of quieting it by -05 dBA--the same 
reduction as on the left side.  This is more than I wanted (because it left the 
two ends about the same in volume), so I removed the right-hand leather 
baffle and trimmed it to be about 1/16&quot; from all six sides.  Then it was 
reinstalled, with the result:</p>

<div class="measurement-table shaded boxed">
<table width="100%" cellspacing="5">
<tr>
<td>(Installed on Left Side)</td>
</tr><tr>

</tr>
</table>
</div> <!--verysmall top1em-->

<p>This seems to be about right.  Changing the right-hand leather baffle 
to have a somewhat larger slit around its edge reduces the sound level 
of the right side by only -02 dBA, a hardly-noticeable amount.  With all baffles,
a single melody note on the right side is now about +05 dBA louder than a three-note
chord on the left hand, and clearly audible.</p>

purchased from Chris Algar.  This is again representative of metal-ended 
Wheatstones--even slightly louder, and again with a very loud left hand side.</p>

<p>I measured the sound unaltered, as the concertina came from the factory:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</div> <!--verysmall top1em-->

<p>This is a very typical result, with the left side about +05 dBA
over the right side--the opposite of what is desired.
I installed baffles as before, trying harder to make the left-hand 
baffle as close-fitting as possible.  This time (at a second try, 
actually) I got about twice the reduction from the leather alone, 
presumably because the baffle fits more closely:</p>

<p>I then installed a standard-cut baffle on the right-hand side, with 
the expected effect.  This produced an instrument significantly 
quieter overall, as well as being balanced in the way I wanted it:</p>

<p>Finally, I installed baffles on the same principle in an old Lachenal, 
#1746 (possibly before 1900?), a 46-key Maccann Duet with nickel plated ends 
with dark wood, bone buttons (unbushed), and six-fold bellows with bellows papers,
purchased from Chris Algar.</p>

<p>This instrument is considerably different from the others: it does
not appear to have been an expensive instrument, but on the other hand it has 
the best tone (unbaffled) of any instrument I've ever owned.  Examined carefully, 
the remaining Lachenal label can be seen to be mounted on a cloth backing
which must be the remains 
of an original linen lining from which the label has been cut.  Curiously,
in its unbaffled state, this is the only instrument I've ever played in which 
the right hand was naturally louder than the left--it was the original inspiration 
which led me to try to use baffles to make other instruments more like 
this one, so I could play them!  Also, its tone changes the most when baffles are added, 
becoming &quot;sweeter&quot; and smoother to an exceptional degree.  The reeds are undoubtedly 
steel, and I haven't noticed anything obviously unusual about its reeds, reed-frames, 
or reed-chambers, so I cannot explain why it sounds so good.</p>

<p>I measured the sound unaltered, as the concertina came from the factory, 
finding that a single note on the right side was, indeed, just about 
&quot;clearly audible&quot; over a three-note chord on the left side (the negative 
difference of &quot;-04 dBA&quot; means that the right side is louder):</p>

<p>I installed baffles as before, making the leather baffle on the left 
just ordinarily close-fitting so as not to reduce the sound too much:</p>

</tr>
</table>
</div> <!--verysmall top1em-->

<p>I then installed a second standard-cut leather baffle on the right-hand side, with 
the expected effect.  This produced an instrument somewhat quieter overall, 
as well as being balanced.  The right hand was left significantly louder 
than the left, so the end result is an instrument that has become quieter
than it was originally, with a somewhat more pronounced right side:</p>

<h2 id="b14">14. Summary</h2>

<p>What I did, typically, was to</p> 

<ul>
  <li>(i) add a close-fitting leather baffle to the left side;</li>
  <li>(ii) add a baffle-lining of acoustical fabric inside the leather, and</li>
  <li>(iii) add an inner baffle of fabric inside the reed-pan on the left side; then</li>
  <li> (iv) add a loose-fitting leather baffle to the right side.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result is that the volume of the left side is reduced to half or less 
of its original level.  The volume of the right side is reduced by a smaller 
amount to change the balance of the two ends.</p>

<p>In the first two cases measured, as shipped from the factory the right side 
(a single melody note) was about 5 dBA quieter than the left side (a three-note 
chord), so it couldn't be heard; afterward, a single note on the right side is 
actually about 5 dBA louder than a chord on the left, which leaves the melody 
&quot;clearly audible&quot; over the chords.  The two sides look alike, and the tone is 
modified in a similar &quot;sweeter&quot; way on both sides.  The result is an 
instrument with a balance that I can play with a great deal more satisfaction.</p>

<p>My concertinas themselves are left unmodified, and all trace of the baffles 
can be removed in a few minutes leaving no damage.  The total cost for the 
materials (a goatskin, a roll of double-sided tape, and a linear yard of 
acoustical fabric), is about USD 120 (GBP 85, EUR 135) which is enough to 
provide baffles for at least two large concertinas, or four smaller concertinas.  
A sound level meter for an additional USD 60 (GBP 42, EUR 68) is highly 
recommended to provide unambiguous feedback.</p>
