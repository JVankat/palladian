Republican senators are seeking to use their appointments as an opportunity to shed light on problems they see at the organization. 'The BBG is the most worthless organization in the federal government,' Sen. Tom Coburn, R-OK, told The Cable in an interview. 'It's full of people who know nothing about media or foreign policy. All they are doing is spending money and somebody's got to look into it.' ... The board should have eight full time governors, but there are only four at the present time (in addition to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who serves in an ex-officio capacity) and the eight new nominees are all being held up by Coburn, who wants to meet with each of them individually before he will allow their nominations to go forward. ... Our sources say that senators like DeMint and Coburn are fed up with the lack of congressional oversight of the BBG and also with the well-established custom of doling out the board's positions to political types like Meehan and Perino, who in Coburn's view don't have the experience or expertise to sit atop an organization crucial to America's international diplomacy." <i>A weekly audience of 171 million is pretty good for "worthless." Meanwhile, there seems to be the usual confusion on the part of decision makers, commentators, and senior fellows about whether US international broadcasting should be broadcasting news or messages in support of US policies. Arguments for the former are in my New York Times op-ed pieces on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/opinion/04elliott.html">4 June 2007</a> and <a href="http://kimelli.nfshost.com/writings/elliottoped.pdf">16 November 2002</a>.</i> See <a href="?id=8839">previous post</a> about same subject.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American (American Enterprise Institute), 30 Apr 2010, Danielle Pletka: "[T]he Broadcasting Board of Governors—a board that was created nominally to oversee the various broadcasting arms of the USG, but all too quickly became a perch for political cronies of various presidents and poobahs. Worse still, the cronies (not all, mind you, but too many) seemed to think that rather than maintaining the firewall between State and broadcasters to stop the foreign service bureaucracy from interfering in broadcasting, they were actually there to manage content on a daily basis, boss around the surrogate radios like Radio Free Europe, dictate the balance between Britney and news (more Brit, less news), and ensure that no one listens to the Voice of America (except for those who think the Iranian regime is pretty great, apparently). ... Time to rethink the BBG, methinks." <i>-- I hope shethinks also about USIB without a board to provide a firewall, as discussed in <a href="?id=7757">previous post</a>.</i> <br />

Even before his [nomination] by the Obama administration, Lobo had announced his plans to leave WEDU after nearly eight years as CEO. Now age 73, the Ybor City native had come out of retirement to take the reins at WEDU, having spent the first 40 years of his work life at commercial network TV affiliates; when he took over as president in June 2002, the station had implemented $2 million in budget cuts and laid off one-third its staff. Since then, Lobo notched some important achievements -- helping WEDU find new funding sources, create new local shows and completing a $15 million conversion to digital broadcasting. But the station also faced more substantial cuts, shaving $500,000 from its budget in 2008, freezing salaries, instituting some pay cuts and laying off staff."

For me, that's part of the magic. And it's a direct pipeline to the news of the day. Stories that seemed distant and a bit unreal over the TV take on a new dimension. You hear the voices, the local take on things -- unfiltered by American sensibilities. The first time I wrote a column about shortwave radio my editors were aghast. No one cares, they told me. It's old tech, not high tech. But each time I do this, I hear from nostalgic readers who want to try it again as well as from folks who almost instinctively understand the magic and want a part of it." <i>-- Nostalgic readers who try shortwave again may be surprised to learn that most of the European stations that were staples though the 1980s have left shortwave. Now the bands are dominated by privately owned US shortwave stations with religious programs, non-mainstream political talk, and vendors of gold and survivalist products. With patience, however, broadcasts from distant countries can still be heard, and the fun is knowing the signal comes directly through the ether from that broadcaster to your radio.</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Update:</b> David Goren writes: "When I'm casually tuning looking for strong armchair quality signals to listen to in the evening Radio Havana Cuba, China Radio International, Radio Romania International, Radio Exterior de España, Voice of Turkey, Radio Bulgaria, and Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran are quite commonly heard, along with R. Amazonas, Brazil on 6185, and 11780. In the morning and early afternoon All India Radio, Polish Radio, CBC Northern Quebec Service, Radio Canada International, Radio Kuwait all put strong signals into my Brooklyn [location]. I won't argue that shortwave is a growth medium, but in those countries I listed shortwave is still part of their communications strategy." <br />

The BBC is the world’s largest and most multilingual newsgathering organization. Non-Americans all over the world access NPR for its diverse global coverage.

The measure that won committee approval on Tuesday has no force of law, but it nonetheless petitions the BBG to 'expand international broadcasting in Iran,' while promoting 'means which provide for the dissemination of accurate and independent information... through radio, television, Internet, mobile devices and other forms of connective technology.' ... VOA has long tried to broadcast into Iran, albeit to no avail. Officials in Tehran have recently jammed the station's signal, primarily out of fear that U.S.-based broadcasting would only intensify the standoff between the state government and the election protesters who saw the return of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as illegitimate."

Iranian citizen journalists sent VOA 300 videos daily, along with thousands of still pictures, e-mails, and telephone calls. PNN used Twitter, blogs, Facebook and YouTube pages to inform Iranians about developments inside their country and website traffic from Iran ballooned by 500 percent in June.

Call it KPRC. Or as the locals quip: Keep Galveston Broadcasting Chinese. The little Texas station may be modest, but it is part of a multibillion-dollar effort by the Chinese government to expand its influence around the world. As China rises as a global force, its leaders think that their country is routinely mischaracterized and misunderstood and that China needs to spread its point of view on everything from economics to art to counter the influence of the West. Beijing's new response is typically massive and ambitious: a $6.6 billion global strategy to create media giants that will challenge agenda-setting Western behemoths such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the BBC and CNN. At a time when the Western media are contracting, China is pushing its government-run news services to expand from America to Zimbabwe. The Chinese are creating TV networks, pouring millions into English-language newspapers, leasing radio stations on all continents and broadcasting TV news to a worldwide audience in six languages. The stations don't broadcast outright propaganda, but rather programming with a Chinese focus and flavor, tailored for local audiences. In Galveston, the format mixes China-centric international news, talk shows about the status of China's women and a healthy dose of gangsta rap -- all in English." <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Well, not propaganda by way of adjectives and imperatives. But, yes, propaganda, in the choice of news items, which follows the line of the Party rather than that of genuine journalists. I remember listening to Radio Peking in the 1960s, beginning each broadcast with a quotation of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Then the "news". Today's China Radio International is much more listenable, and even occasionally reports on negative developments in China.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite its page-one placement, this article incredibly misses a big part of the story.

He failed to convert the opposition party. For a while he seemed to have done so; President Bill Clinton balanced the budget, declared that the era of big government was over, embraced NATO and NAFTA expansion, backed a Republican plan for welfare reform, and sought safety in triangulation. But a series of factors—the Iraq war, George W.

And Barack Obama was elected president on policies that reflected these attitudes. ...

[The Iranian] regime achieved battlefield dominance in the technosphere over the past year. Iranian authorities have used a range of technologies to block, surveil and infiltrate social media. ... Through disinformation, it seems, Iranian intelligence services were able to disband demonstrations before protesters ever arrived on the scene. ... Twitter (or its next variant) will continue to bring protesters to the town hall square. Protesters may even succeed in toppling corrupt, autocratic regimes. But Twitter won't tell the opposition how to govern, how to develop democratic institutions or how to inculcate and defend the values, habits and behaviors that belong to democracy. These things require an immense amount of intellectual, conceptual and political work. And patience. This is especially so in countries that have little or no experience in democracy." <i>The "how to" material is probably best left to NGOs and INGOs, with international broadcasting, in its journalistic function, reporting on "how it is."</i><br />

[R]unning through the whole program was the Dickensian sense that today’s dissidents are living in the best of times and the worst of times: The social-media explosion makes it easier for champions of freedom to organize opposition and get information to the outside world, yet the very same online technology arms repressive governments with sophisticated new methods of censorship, surveillance, and disinformation. Far from ushering in a golden age of democracy, remarked the Bush Institute’s James K. Glassman, a former undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, the Internet era has coincided with a 'freedom recession.'

It became her evening ritual to take a shorthand note of the nightly news broadcasts. But that Friday, March 17, 1944, was different. The broadcast came from Radio Tokyo, the Japanese propaganda station designed to further deflate a war-weary enemy. Yvonne cannot remember listening to Radio Tokyo before or since that night.

U.S.-government-funded organizations like the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute have long supported democracy-building and civil-society programs. Perhaps most significant of all has been Radio Azattyk, the Kyrgyz-language service of the congressionally funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which is the most trusted news outlet in the country thanks to its coverage of corruption, human rights violations, and everyday political developments.

This week most of the new board was finally voted out of committee, under the chairmanship of Walter Isaacson, formerly of Time magazine and CNN. By unanimous vote, the committee voted out Dennis Mulhaupt, Victor H. Ashe, Michael Lynton, S. Enders Wimbush and Sue McCue, the latter being Harry Reid’s former chief of staff.

If you have friends or family in Ethiopia who cannot hear our Horn broadcasts during the pre-election jamming by the Ethiopian government, you can send the newsletter sign-up page and they can enter their e-mail addresses. Although the Ethiopian government is jamming our Amharic, Afan Oromo and Tigrigna language broadcasts, we’re still delivering balanced and up-to-date news from Ethiopia. Amharic news airs seven nights a week, Afan Oromo and Tigrigna five nights a week. And now, at 6 a.m. in Ethiopia, Amharic delivers a rebroadcast of election highlights. To learn more check out our frequencies under Radio Program Information."  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The links are not included in this Nazret.com article. The links <u>are</u> in the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/horn/promotions.cfm">original promotion from VOA</a>. However, I could not find a way to get to this promotion from the VOA Horn of Africa home page. Only a general search found it. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jamming of Afan Oromo and Tigrigna is news to me: previously it was reported that only Amharic was jammed. The new morning Amharic transmission is also a surprise. It is not (yet) listed in the <a href="http://author.voanews.com/english/about/frequenciesAtoZ_a.cfm">VOA frequency schedule</a> (the schedule that appears when clicking on the "Radio Program Information" link mentioned above).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening via the remote monitoring receiver in Addis Ababa, all three of the frequencies for the new morning transmission (at 0300 UTC on 6055, 7300, and 11790 kHz) are succesfully jammed. I'm surprised higher frequencies, which would have to come from the east, are not used, because they might be more effective against the jamming. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the evening transmission at 1800-1900 UTC, now on nine frequencies, I heard two frequencies getting through with at least a fair signal. In <a href="VOA_Amharic_200410.mp3">this audio file</a>, from 20 April, you can hear 1) 15730 kHz getting through at 1815, but 2) covered by jamming at 1845, 3) 13835 fair at 1816, and 4) still fair at 1846. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortwave jamming can be overcome by transmitting on as many frequencies as possible from as many directions as possible.

Those topics are taboo even for channels like Al-Jazeera Arabic, except for occasional segments. Perhaps these problems pale in comparison to the war in Iraq or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Or perhaps the media shy away from controversial topics that could show Arab society in a bad light. But now some of the remarkable women who are challenging these taboos have found a new forum. Ironically, it is Alhurra (The Free One), the U.S. Congress-financed television channel that is giving these women a chance to tell their stories on the air in an hour-long weekly program called Musawat (Equality). ... Some Arabs are skeptical of Alhurra, saying it airs 'American propaganda.' But others question whether it is fair to taint everything produced by Alhurra as untrustworthy just because of its funding. Instead it might be instructive to see if other Arab television stations will follow up on Alhurra’s initiative in getting shows like Musawat on the air."<br />

Alhurra, 'the Free One', had to become a station where everything could be said, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without commercial interruptions. The US government set it up in 2004 and has since invested 500 million dollars of taxpayers' money. It hoped to create the Arab equivalent of Radio Free Europe, the anti-communist station that broadcast information across the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. But Alhurra has proved no match for giants like Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya. Less than 2 percent of viewers watch it occasionally. Most deem it too pro-Western, too biased and unreliable. In Iraq, the channel and its chief editor have become targets for blind hatred." <i>-- A January 2010 performance update for Radio Sawa and Alhurra, available at the <a href="http://www.bbg.gov">BBG website</a>, show a 60% weekly reach for Alhurra in Iraq. This is partly due to Alhurra's access to terrestrial transmitters in Iraq, an asset it does not enjoy in other Arab countries.

<a href="http://www.w4uvh.net/dxld1014.txt">DX Listening Digest, 8 April 2010</a>: Letter from Rep. Walter B. Jones (R-NC) to reader Glenn Swiderski: "As you know, the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Request for the Broadcasting  Board of Governors (BBG) included a proposal to close the Voice of America station outside Greenville, North Carolina. This is the last  U.S. government-owned shortwave broadcasting facility in the  continental United States. In my opinion, if the U.S. is going to remain in the business of beaming radio programming into foreign lands as part of our national  security strategy, then it makes no sense to do what the BBG has  proposed: namely, to close this station and increase our reliance on  broadcasting via foreign terrestrial or satellite radio transmission  facilities. Such action would be fraught with security issues and  could be far more costly to taxpayers over the long term."<br />

IRIB’s response was contained in a letter to the ITU Secretary-General, Hamadoun Touré, from Mohammad Hosseini, adviser to the IRIB President and Chairman of its Center for International Affairs. Dr Hosseini said IRIB had itself been the victim of interference to its signals, causing considerable problems to its networks.

The Voice of Russia broadcasting company was the first to implement the new digital standard 7 years ago. All industrial countries are to shift to the digital system shortly. The global digital revolution began in 1998, when DRM broadcasting emerged. The consortium features hundreds of radio stations including such media giants as BBC, Deutsche Welle, Radio France Internationale. DRM is the universal, openly standardized, digital radio system for short-wave, medium-wave and long-wave - digital radio with the ability to use existing frequencies and bandwidth across the globe. Another advantage is its high resistance to interference, compared to other standards, which is essential for broadcasting over large territories. The Voice of Russia is a pioneer of digital broadcasting in Russia. After a series of successful experiments within the DRM standard, the company has been broadcasting in the digital format daily since 2003, says Rashel Stavisskaya, VoR consultant: 'Today, VoR features are broadcasted  in the digital standard to Europe  in Russian, English, German and French. We are also broadcasting to China and India. The new technology opens new horizons. Digital radio has near-CD sound. The VoR plans to broadcast to Arab countries and Latin America'." <i>I would call it near-FM sound, and I have found DRM to be rather vulnerable to interference. In some cases, it does eliminate low-level background interference.</i>  <br />

It seems reluctant to take into account the centuries-old tribal structure and traditions in Afghanistan, particularly in the region around Kandahar where the insurgency is strongest. Unless there is a genuine effort to understand the roots of the crisis and ultimately solve it in accordance with local tradition and practice, it will be almost impossible to convince the pro-Taliban fighters to lay down their weapons and pledge support for the government. Instead of resorting to such devastating military operations, the international community should encourage Kabul to convene an inclusive regional tribal jirga (council) in Kandahar that would bring together all tribal chiefs from the provinces of Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul, Oruzgan, Ghazni, and Farah. The international community should create a neutral mechanism for convening and hosting the Jirga to enable the tribal elders to express their wider concerns freely. Once those concerns are understood and addressed, then a military plan could be prepared to isolate and ultimately knock out the insurgents."

But let’s say an English-speaking person wants to know more. Placing myself in that position, I went online to see what was out there. What did I find? Starting with the BBC’s Kyrgyz page, I found several stories—in Kyrgyz. Looking for the English-language version of that page, I found none, which left me clicking all over the site.  ... Finally I found it—in a place most Americans wouldn’t think of looking, even though it is paid for by our tax dollars: the Kyrgyz service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. ... The first thing I noticed was that, unlike the BBC, RFE/RL posts an English page for each of its 28 language services. ... As a government-funded entity, RFE/RL can never divorce itself entirely from America’s short-term interest. But at the same time, surrogate broadcasting should not be reduced to state propaganda. ... Here is the lesson from Kyrgyzstan: The best way to serve both the short- and long-term goals of the United States is to provide people in unfree societies a model of what our own free and responsible media used to look like."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ms. Bayles apparently did not type Kyrgyzstan in the search function at the top of the BBC World Service or most other BBC web pages. This yields a column of news stories about the country, another column with BBC blog entries, other sections with background information about Kyrgyzstan, and the weather there today. There is even a sports section (though there seems to have been no notable sports news from Kyrgyzstan since 2008).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Bayles has, nevertheless, stumbled on an irony of the BBC's web effort: the BBC World Service website is not really the best place to go for world news, at least not in English. For that, go to www.bbcnews.com, or (the same) news.bbc.co.uk. Then search by region: Kyrgyzstan is assigned to Asia-Pacific. Click on the most recent Kyrgyzstan story to find links to other stories about the country. The search function, however, is the best way to get news about the country.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RFE/RL site <u>is</u> an excellent and well-sorted-out source of news in English about its target countries. It also has more stories about Kyrgyzstan than does the BBC, though the BBC's volume of output about the country is impressive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"America's short-term interest" would be reflected by language choices for RFE/RL and VOA, such as the recent addition of VOA's Deewa Radio in Pashto for the Pakistan/Afghanistan frontier region, and the more recent addition of RFE/RL's Radio Mashaal in Pashto for the Pakistan/Afghanistan frontier region. (Why having two broadcasting services providing much the same news to the same region in the same language is in America's short-term interest is beyond my comprehension. See <a href="?id=8154">previous post</a>.) If America's short-term interest is evident in the content of RFE/RL or VOA, even if mixed with straight news, the audience is likely to dismiss the stations as propaganda operations. The advocacy of US short-, middle-, and long-term interests should be left to US public diplomacy, which is the job of another agency, in another building.</i></div><p class="title"><a rel="bookmark" href="http://kimelli.nfshost.com/index.php?id=8767">Obituary: Arthur Siegel, authored history of Radio Canada International.</a></p>

Gauteng DA spokesman for economic affairs Gavin Lewis yesterday asked who benefited from a deal that did not appear to be in the interest of the Gauteng taxpayer, calling for the present Gauteng economic development MEC, Firoz Cachalia, to stop avoiding the issue and respond to questions raised about the deal or institute a probe. Lewis, who intends to raise the CNBC Africa matter with the auditor-general, said the deal was 'so one-sided against citizens of Gauteng that it must raise suspicions as to why it was agreed to in the first place'. ... The deal, signed when Paul Mashatile was MEC, with the Gauteng Film Commission allegedly undertook to pay the channel [US$] 3m a year if CNBC Africa was unable to attract sufficient advertising." Chantelle Benjamin, <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201004080344.html">Business Day (Johannesburg), 8 April 2010</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"CNBC Africa recently released a statement [regarding] the cancelling of an agreement between the business channel and the Gauteng Film Commission: 'CNBC Africa produced a series of programmes called “Business Spotlight” with sponsorship and associated advertising via the Gauteng Film Commission (GFC).

The editorial control of all programmes rested with CNBC Africa at all times.'" <a href="http://www.bizcommunity.com/InBrief/196/66/9629.html">Bizcommunity.com, 8 April 2010</a>. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The US-based CNBC International defended its South African arm this week, with spokesman Brian Steel saying the channel retains a reputation for being 'unbiased everywhere we operate'. CNBC owns no shares in CNBC Africa, but the local business is an 'affiliate' of the US brand. ... [N]either CNBC's US office, nor the South African business, were willing to explain why the organisation initially denied the existence of such a 'guarantee' from Gauteng. In 2007, CNBC's former chief operating officer Trevor Ormerod told Business Day there was no 'soft deal' with Gauteng, or any contract providing a guarantee to pay a shortfall in advertising sales. 'Gauteng said they would like to advertise, and we have supported them with a (normal) advertising deal, that's all,' he said then."

Over a dozen radio stations from the United States, South Korea and Japan currently broadcast to North Korea. Voice of America (VOA), one of the most popular stations, has been broadcasting to the North since 1942, while the equally popular Radio Free Asia (RFA) began its Korean service soon after its establishment by Congress in 1997. VOA focuses on news of the U.S. and the world, while RFA concentrates on North Korea and life for the nearly 20,000 defectors in the South. ... While we must be careful not to draw too many conclusions from samples that are far from random, it is not unreasonable to surmise that there are more than a million surreptitious listeners in a population of 24 million. ... We can do much more to improve broadcasting to North Korea. VOA and RFA only broadcast five hours a day, and the defector stations limp along on shoestring budgets due to widespread public indifference in South Korea." Peter Beck, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303828304575180752839519336.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal, 14 April 2010</a>. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If Mr. Beck's description of VOA versus RFA were true, it would mean that North Koreans would have to tune to RFA to get part of the news, and to VOA to get the rest of the news. So instead of an unsatisfactory situation subjecting North Korean listeners to inconvenience, we have an unsatisfactory situation in which two U.S. funded stations duplicate one another's efforts.  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOA and RFA <u>each</u> broadcast five hours a day, and not concurrently, for a total of ten hours a day.  These are the key evening, late-night, and morning listening hours. Additional broadcasts would occur during working hours, yielding diminished returns for the extra expense. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A million listeners?  Maybe, but we can't conclude that based on any of the available surveys of North Korean defectors. We do know the audience size in North Korea is above zero. Some of the Chinese radios are cheap, but I'm not aware of any decent models with a shortwave band costing three dollars.  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only indifference in South Korea, but also policy considerations, which prevents the defector stations transmitting from South Korea (including on medium wave, audible on more North Korean radio sets than shortwave).</i>   <br />

Bam!' — the sound of gunshots that Somalis in Mogadishu have grown accustomed to hearing for decades — was played by Radio Shabelle on its daily news broadcast to replace the music it usually uses to introduce the segment. Similarly odd sounds — like the roar of an engine, a car horn, animal noises and the sound of water flowing — were used to announce programs on some of the other radio stations that stopped playing music. 'We have replaced the music of the early morning program with the sound of the cock, replaced the news music with the sound of the firing bullet and the night program of News Series with the sound of running horses,' said Osman Abdullahi Guure, the director of Radio Shabelle radio and TV, one of the most influential radio stations in Mogadishu. ... Many residents expressed dismay at the new restrictions. “We are really losing of all hope of life,” said Hashi Abdullahi, who listens to music on the radio. The insurgents have 'punished our life with bullets, and today they are punishing us by a ban on all types of music,' he said. ... Still, at least two radio stations remained independent of the ban. The government owned Radio Mogadishu and another station, Radio Bar-Kulan, which is mostly produced in Kenya, continued playing music."

'When broadcasting was cared for by previous governments, spare parts for radio transmitters were procured expressly to ensure minimum service outage. The short wave services have been off air since February 1, 2010 and as I speak to you the situation is still the same.' He said the government had neglected rural people who depended on ZNBC radio one."

The government later agreed to let the station resume broadcasting, after shutting it down for inciting hatred." <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-09/thai-protesters-vow-to-retake-tv-station-defy-emergency-decree.html">Bloomberg, 10 April 2010</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protesters in Thailand overran a satellite TV station Friday and muscled their anti-government TV channel back on the air in a sign of rising defiance two days after authorities declared a state of emergency in Bangkok, the capital. Thousands of protesters, known as 'Red Shirts,' dodged water cannons and tear gas as they scrambled over barbed wire to open the gates of the secure site. Most troops quickly dropped their bid to defend the Thaicom satellite station, about 35 miles north of Bangkok, allowing the People's Channel to resume transmissions to about 10 million viewers."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After scattered hand to hand scuffles, the troops retreated in disarray, some taking positions inside the main Thaicom building. After talks were held between protest leaders and the authorities, agreement was reached to allow People Channel to resume broadcasting, and protesters and soldiers left the site. But several hours later, more than 4,000 army troops retook the transmission complex and cut off the People Channel's signal again."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some 200 red shirts gathered at the Thaicom station after the government unplugged their mouthpiece People Channel satellite television, taking it go off the air for the first time. Before the screen went static, red-shirt leaders had told viewers: 'If you no longer see us, if your screen goes dark, come to Bangkok and join us immediately.'" <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/04/09/politics/Fateful-Friday-30126765.html">The Nation (Bangkok), 9 April 2010</a>.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thaicom Plc, the country's sole satellite service provider, said the government's blocking of the red shirts' People Channel television station (PTV) had severely damaged its international reputation. The company said foreign customers using the same transponder as PTV were threatening to sue Thaicom for their losses. An executive expressed concern that interference with the station's signals could damage the satellite's transponder. 'Despite the fact that signal jamming violates our contract and causes severe damage to our reputation, we must follow the order,' the executive said. ... The executive said Thaicom could not directly shut down PTV because the station broadcasts via the Israeli firm's uplink facility. Thaicom could only block the signal being beamed from the Thaicom 5 satellite by jamming the C-band frequency. The signal jamming not only caused PTV to be taken off the air but also interrupted five other channels on the same transponder. The satellite's transponder was also damaged, the source said. The Israeli firm eventually decided to shut down PTV to avoid other channels being affected."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"TRT Arabic will feature a morning schedule tailored toward Arabic women as well as children’s programming, documentaries, current affairs and Turkish dramas dubbed into Arabic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time a foreign satellite channel steps into the crowded world of Arabic television, we are always tempted to overestimate its effects on public opinion in the region. But a new Turkish initiative may finally live up to expectations. It all started in 2004 with the American Al Hurra channel, followed by a spate of foreign Arabic television broadcasts from countries like Iran, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia and most recently China. But a few months into operations, they all realised how frustrating it is to make the slightest dent in the deep-running cynicism in the Middle East. ...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Turkey now wants to be an actor in the Middle East. (TRT El Turkiye) is one element of this policy' of re-balancing Turkish diplomacy which for years followed an exclusively Western-oriented path, said Mete Cubukcu, an editor at the NTV news channel and an expert on the Arab world. This drive, coupled with [Prime Minister Recep Tayyip] Erdogan's strong criticism of Israel in the Palestinian conflict, gives Turkey 'a lot of prestige' in the Middle East, which could prove useful to the new channel, Cubukcu said. But to find itself a place in the Arab market, TRT El Turkiye should be careful not to become a tool for propaganda, stressed the expert. 'There are already many international channels in Arabic. If this one wants to find its place, it has to offer objective information,' he added." <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20100407-television-becomes-turkeys-new-weapon-seduce-arab-world">AFP, 7 April 2010</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Update:</b> "Even the launch of BBC Arabic two years ago seems dull in comparison to the attention received by the launch of the official Turkish channel TRT al Turkiye. This is also despite the fact that the official Turkish channel seems to be the most modest in terms of production and coverage in comparison to the other Arabic-language channels. ... Of course it is very early to evaluate this channel, but it is clear that TRT al Turkiye is not like any other channel, as it is not a news channel, and it only has a limited crew with a small network of correspondents. This is a general channel that will include a mixture of programming, from drama, the arts, news, and the economy. This is a mixture of programming that will allow the Turks to proudly present Erdogan's harsh attitude towards Israel and broadcast their famous drama Noor, and its star Mohanned who is famous throughout the Arab world, rather than through Arab channels, thereby making large political and financial gains. ... Turkey should ... not allow its new alignment with us to blind its media to the major problems that our countries are suffering from."

Manassas was touted as 'the most successful BPL deployment in the nation' when FCC Chairman Michael Powell visited the site with much fanfare -- and, the ARRL maintains, in violation of the FCC's own rules -- on the eve of the FCC's vote to adopt inadequate protection for licensed radio services against interference from BPL systems." <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2010/04/08/11427/?nc=1">ARRL, 8 April 2010</a>.<br />

Reports of the harassment of opposition political figures and interfering with international media broadcasts into the country undermine the image of his government, and if the polling is to be credible, it must be an open process. Following the jamming of the Voice of America's radio broadcasts in Ethiopia's dominant Amharic language for the last four weeks, the government there appears to now have turned its attention to VOA's Internet service in the East African nation. Numerous reports have been received that VOA's website is unavailable inside Ethiopia, where individuals both inside and out of Africa often turn when they cannot get a radio signal."

"In a recent editorial reflecting the official position of the US government, VOA has declared that silence is not golden in Ethiopia at a time when Meles is muffling America’s voice. 'While a friend and supporter of Ethiopia, the United States nevertheless cannot remain silent on such actions and censorship, which run counter to the country’s constitution. It is watching with great interest and encourages all parties there to act responsibly during the election campaign. An election cannot be run under the guise of democratic process if all candidates cannot participate freely and state their case or if political news is suppressed,' the editorial said. The statement is unprecedented by itself due to the fact that the US has chosen to turn blind eyes and deaf ears for nearly two decades. Mr. Zenawi has been committing gross human rights violations and atrocities without any serious criticisms from Washington and its allies, which are known to be too quick to condemn unfriendly tyrants in countries like Burma, Zimbabwe, Iran and Cuba."

When insurgents open fire in Marjah, an armoured vehicle wired up to powerful speakers blasts out country, heavy metal and rock music so loudly it can be heard up to two kilometres (one mile) away. The playlist has been hand-selected to annoy the Taliban, according to one US special forces officer. 'Taliban hate that music,' said the sergeant involved in covert psychological operations, or 'psy ops', in the area in Helmand province. 'Some locals complain but it's a way to push them to choose. It's motivating Marines as well,' he added after one deafening round of several hours including tracks from The Offspring, Metallica and Thin Lizzy. The officer said they also broadcast messages from the Afghan government, as well as threats to the Taliban -- there are no obscenities, 'but we tell them they're gonna die', he smiled. How effective the method is in sending the Taliban running for cover is difficult to tell, but local children certainly don't like it -- many of them cover their ears from the onslaught of loud bass guitars and drums. Lieutenant Colonel Brian Christmas -- the commander of US Marines in northern Marjah -- said he was unaware of the musical psy ops.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and Iran's nuclear program won the spotlight at the Arab League Summit, held in Libya over the weekend, Arab leaders endorsed a low profile -- yet dangerous -- document. Proposed by Syrian President Bashar Assad to presumably 'manage Arab differences,' the first article of the document stipulated that Arab regimes 'should not launch any kind of media campaigns, against each other, for [such campaigns] obstruct the management of differences, efforts aimed at compromise, and reinstatement of normalcy [in bilateral relations].' ... Arab satellite channels, such as Qatari Al-Jazeera that claims to be a champion of human rights and scrutinizes every American behavior to propagandize against it, did not make a big deal out of the Syrian censorship document. To understand why the always-agitated Al-Jazeera remained silent on the Syrian Arab censorship document, one should always remember the Syrian perception of how regimes 'should not launch any kind of media campaigns against each other.' The Syrian understanding of media outlets, whether satellite TVs, radios or newspapers, as regime-owned tools perfectly fits Al-Jazeera, which is owned by Qatar's despot. And since Assad and the Qatari autocrat have been allies for some years, Al-Jazeera found nothing wrong with turning a blind eye toward a Syrian initiative that aims at censoring all Arab media."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hot Bird 8 may be Europe's largest and most powerful television satellite, but it still has little chance when the Iranian regime decides to block its signals. When that happens, the Farsi services of the BBC and Voice of America instantly disappear from television screens -- and not just in Iran, but also throughout the satellite's entire coverage area. ... Indeed, it would seem that it is often surprisingly easy for the regime in Tehran to suppress information from abroad. Although Hot Bird 8 is in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers (22,400 miles) above the Earth, it can be easy to sabotage, something which is also true for many other satellites. The Iranians only need to transmit a strong signal in the satellite's direction using the same frequency with which programs are transmitted from the original ground transmission station. ... In the meantime, the satellite operator has changed how some of its services are distributed. The channels affected thusfar are now transmitted via other satellites that can broadcast to the entire Gulf region, but without being reachable by uplinks from Iran. Not all the channels on Hot Bird 8 have been affected by the electronic sabotage, however. The state broadcaster Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting also transmits its Press TV foreign service from Hot Bird 8. So far, it has not experienced any problems."

For nearly 70 years, the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) monitored the world’s airwaves and other news outlets, transcribing and translating selected contents into English and in the process creating a multi-million page historical archive of the global news media. Yet, FBIS material has not been widely utilized in the academic content analysis community, perhaps because relatively little is known about the scope of the content that is digitally available to researchers in this field. This article, researched and written by a specialist in the field, contains a brief overview of the service — reestablished as the Open Source Center in 2004 — and a statistical examination of the unclassified FBIS material produced from July 1993 through July 2004 — a period during which FBIS produced and distributed CDs of its selected material. Examined are language preferences, distribution of monitored sources, and topical and geographic emphases. The author examines the output of a similar service provided by the British Broadcasting Service (BBC), known as the Summary of World Broadcasts (SWB)."

[I]t is surprising that the author presents such a complete survey in so many respects, but without explanation omits international broadcasting (p.9), which is an important part of public diplomacy. It is true than since the Broadcasting Board of Governors took it over completely in 1999 they have managed it without paying attention to other PD tools, so the coordination that existed under USIA, minimal as it was, got lost completely. Nevertheless it is an important function that should be included in any survey.</i> Reviewed by William A.

Back in 2006, Jarvis coined a term called 'networked journalism,' an approach to news that combines the work of both professional journalists and amateurs. ... Here’s an example: On Al Jazeera’s beta site, War on Gaza, users in region can submit events, from protests to incidents of violence, using SMS or Twitter. The site is powered using Ushahidi, a tool designed to crowdsource crisis situations. ... Richard Gizbert, host of one of the channel’s most popular shows The Listening Post and featured in the video above, presented the site, calling the work of the public almost indistinguishable from Al Jazeera itself. 'These guys are producers for us, they don’t even know it and we don’t pay them,' Gizbert said."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mr. Gizbert's description is not very flattering to Al Jazeera, is it? And, whatever we may think about the events in that part of the world, "War on Gaza" is not the name a news organization interested in credibility would give to one of its websites. I notice that a few of the "incidents" listed in War on Gaza are rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel. The great majority are Israeli actions in, or into, Gaza. The Nieman Journalism Lab, a project of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, might want to look at this project with more critical and less starry eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if they innovated as quickly as AJE, but BBC World News and CNN International are also implementing "networked journalism." And networked journalism is not really new. Jonathan Marks, George Wood, I, and other producers of the DX/media programs on shortwave used listener-submitted news (sent via the miracle of international airmail) decades ago. Also, over the decades, all-news radio stations in the United States asked listeners to call their dedicated news-tip telephone numbers, and would put these people on the air for eyewitness accounts.</i></div><p class="title"><a rel="bookmark" href="http://kimelli.nfshost.com/index.php?id=8642">Al Jazeera will buy Sarajevo radio and television channel (updated).</a></p>

It certainly doesn’t build an independent film industry.' ... Then there’s the question of CNBC Africa itself. A cloud now hangs over the editorial integrity of the broadcaster, whether it admits to it or not. ... [T]he key interview on CNBC Africa’s launch night in June 2007 was with President Thabo Mbeki. Those were tough months for the former president, his Machiavellian war with Jacob Zuma was approaching the final battle, and he wasn’t saying much to the press – and yet his minions were so pleased with the CNBC Africa appearance that a transcript was posted to the official website of the presidency."

In signing the agreement the GFC has provided a guarantee to CNBC Africa, which ensures a minimum annual advertising income in support of the establishment of its studios.' It reads a bit like an agreement between the state and a public broadcaster, which CNBC Africa isn’t."

We are also broadcasting to China and India. The new technology opens new horizons. Digital radio has near-CD sound. The VoR plans to broadcast to Arab countries and Latin America'. Radio experts believe DRM to be the future of broadcasting. Its main advantage is a high quality of sound, the same as mp-3 players have.

Now I listen to BBC Radio 5 and World Service, and to All Things Considered and All Songs Considered on the National Public Radio (NPR). ... In Delhi, I don’t know anyone who listens to radio except in cars. Perhaps listening to radio at home is no longer cool. A couple of years ago, while holidaying in a friend’s house in the hills of Dehradun, I heard the sound of BBC news floating in from the garden. There was a crackle in the audio and I knew it had to be a radio. I walked towards the sound and saw a man, a foreigner, on a bench with an old-fashioned radio—the kind I once had—by his side. It was [former chief of the BBC New Delhi bureau] Mark Tully. That was the last time I saw someone using a radio set."

In some cities, it's carried by the largest pubTV station in the market, such as San Francisco's KQED and Philadephia's WHYY, but in many it's on a less-watched station.
