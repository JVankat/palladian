      <h3>Lesson 1 - <font color="#000080">Basic Attitude Instrument Flying</font></h3>
 
      <dl>
      <dd> This lesson consists of familiarization with the airplane's systems
and their operation as they relate to instrument flight. Its objectives are
to review instrument rating purposes, limitations and requirements, to introduce
the student to proper instrument interpretation, scan, and to emphasize reliance
on instrument indications to the exclusion of kinesthetic sensations. In
this lesson, and throughout the entire IFR training regimen, instructors
are encouraged to expose students to actual IMC flight conditions and using
the system at every reasonable opportunity.

with practice in exercising his/her judgment while called upon to make the
many decisions inherent in the planning and execution of an IFR flight. During

plan filing including acquisition and interpretation of weather, route selection,
