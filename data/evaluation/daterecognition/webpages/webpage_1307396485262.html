<div class="storycontent">
<div id="attachment_110" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 127px"><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/human-has-rights.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-110  " title="Human-Has-Rights" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/human-has-rights.jpg?w=117&#038;h=147" alt="" width="117" height="147" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But Why?</p></div>
<p>There are few things that annoy me more than hearing people say they have a “right” to whatever they arbitrarily decide. Most recently it’s been the sanctimonious student protestors who have been declaring that everyone has the right to free higher education. The first reaction to hearing such claims is to say, “No they don’t”, and my second reaction is to ask where this supposed right comes from. The whole culture of rights is poisonous to society because it breeds a sense of entitlement to whatever you desire. Free higher education? Never before in human history has such a concept arisen but that doesn’t stop some students suddenly declaring that it is a universal right. The ability for break into and vandalise private property? It’s their right to protest.</p>
<p>This nonsense has arisen since the introduction of the Human Rights Acts during the first term of New Labour. Before these laws were introduced we still had practically the same freedom that we do now. The only difference was that freedom was already assumed because it wasn’t specifically prohibited by law. Now it is decreed in a set of vague sweeping statements that are open to endless reinterpretation.</p>
<div id="attachment_113" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 147px"><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/magnacartal_228x316_2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-113 " title="magnacartal_228x316_2" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/magnacartal_228x316_2.jpg?w=137&#038;h=190" alt="" width="137" height="190" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Magna Carta</p></div>
<p>The “rights” in the Human Rights Act are very different to those of the Magna Carta and the English and American bills of rights. Rather than sweeping, vague statements these are concrete limits on the power of the state. Under these pieces of legislation the state cannot imprison a citizen without trial, try him without a jury, search homes without a warrant, censor newspapers, or exercise arbitrary power without the consent of parliament. It is worth noting that in these pieces of legislation the word “right” is a direct translation of Norman French ‘droit’, simply meaning ‘law’. There is no room for courts to endlessly reinterpret them and dream up new rights for criminals and terrorists, or anyone else for that matter. What you have are simple, specific statements which tell the state what it cannot do.</p>
<p>Under Anglo-Saxon common law the citizen is assumed to be free to do as they please provided it is not prohibited by law. Therefore the need for statements telling people what they CAN do is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>There are also the inevitable caveats in declarations of human rights, stating that those rights may be exercised provided they don’t infringe on other people’s and, most sinisterly, that these rights may be withdrawn in an “emergency”. The trouble with the first caveat is that determining when someone’s right has been infringed is as vague as the right itself. Is it wrong, for example, for a teacher to tell an insubordinate student to be quiet because it infringes on his right to free speech? Perhaps lawful imprisonment violates the right to free movement of the prisoner. Such examples may seem absurd, but let’s remember the case of the court refusing to deport terrorist-advocate Abu Hamza or telling the Navy that it may not detain Somali pirates. Then there was the outrage caused when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that prisoners should have the right to vote.</p>
<div id="attachment_116" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/1195_hitler_und_hindenburg.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-116" title="1195_hitler_und_hindenburg" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/1195_hitler_und_hindenburg.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=216" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Weimar Constitution Enabled Tyranny</p></div>
<p>There is also great scope for abuse of the “emergency” clauses. The Weimer constitution of inter-war Germany was one of the most liberal ever dreamt up, and yet it contained a clause saying that all the rights it granted could be withdrawn at will. When the Nazis were elected to power they were able to manufacture an emergency and, at a stroke, deny all rights to free speech, movement and expression. The rights granted by the constitution were effectively inverted and turned into equally sweeping prohibitions, and yet this was not an abuse of the constitution; the clause allowing such a thing to happen was there right from the start. This happened because the well-meaning state decided that it would decree what people can do, rather than how its own power should be limited.</p>
<p>This statist definition of ‘rights’ has its origins in the French Revolution which, incidentally, also unleashed the kind of ruthless terror that tends to accompany such forms of ‘enlightenment’. Sovereignty was taken from God or the Monarch and given to ‘the people’, or so that’s what the advocates said. The only way that ‘sovereignty of the people’ can really operate is through the government which rules over them, which effectively gives that government the ability to say exactly what people can and cannot do. The result was that dictatorships were set up and millions of people were brutally killed, all in the ‘public interest’. Napoleon then spread this form of dictatorship through Europe with his conquests, all the time excusing it as ‘enlightened government’ and ‘liberating the people’. Many of the new constitutions certainly seemed liberal compared to feudalism, but they still assumed the right of the state to grant freedom.</p>
<p><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/1146244_europe_labour_300.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-118" title="_1146244_europe_labour_300" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/1146244_europe_labour_300.jpg?w=150&#038;h=60" alt="" width="150" height="60" /></a>Britain escaped this fate and gradually evolved into a modern constitutional monarchy, with sovereignty still nominally invested in the monarch while daily government is exercised by representatives elected by the people. There was simply no need for Human Rights legislation as the freedoms already existed. It wasn’t until New Labour, with its grandstanding and rabid pro-Europeanism, came to power that ‘Human Rights’ were introduced to Britain. They were brought in to make the UK conform to the European Declaration of Human Rights, based on the fake-liberal Napoleonic laws that had made their way across Europe.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that New Labour, the party of human rights, then proceeded to bring in more draconian laws than any government before. There were attempts to introduce ID cards, a DNA database held the details of thousands of innocent people, and police started prosecuting for “hate crimes” (i.e. holding unfashionable opinions). Before, the British people had freedom of speech without any law saying they did; then as soon as one was brought in there were arrests, prosecutions and cautions for “hate speech”.</p>
<p>Human Rights legislation flies in the face of centuries of British law, it is clearly open to abuse and it is, above all else, totally unnecessary. It was the naivety and vanity of New Labour that brought it in and the Conservatives seem unwilling to repeal it in that face of the righteous indignation of their Liberal Democrat coalition partners. We can only hope that good sense and tradition will triumph before even more absurd judgements are made.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<div id="attachment_95" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/spain_catalunya.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-95" title="spain_catalunya" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/spain_catalunya.png?w=150&#038;h=100" alt="" width="150" height="100" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Catalan Flag</p></div>
<p>Yesterday Catalonia, a region in the north east of Spain, held elections to its parliament and the result was decisive. In further signs that, after rising unemployment and an increasingly weak economy, Spain’s socialist government is on the way out, the conservative parties saw a dramatic rise in their vote</p>
<div id="attachment_87" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/localizacic3b3n_cataluc3b1a.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-87" title="Localización_Cataluña" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/localizacic3b3n_cataluc3b1a.png?w=150&#038;h=126" alt="Catalonia in the north east of Spain" width="150" height="126" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Catalonia in Spain</p></div>
<p>For the past eight years Catalonia has been governed by a “tripartite” coalition of socialists, eco-socialists and far left separatists; however this coalition was roundly defeated as all three of its constituent parties suffered significant losses. The senior partner, the Socialist party of Catalonia (PSC), linked to Spain’s governing Socialist Party, achieved its worst result since the death of Franco, losing 9 seats and achieving 18% of the vote, down from 27%. The cumbersomely named ‘Initiative for Catalan Greens – United and Alternative Left’ (ICV-EUiA) also dropped in vote share and lost two seats, but the most spectacular defeat was for the far-left separatist ‘Catalan Republican Left’ (ERC) who, before the election, were the third largest party in Catalonia but have now dropped to fifth place in terms of vote share and seen their number of seats more than halved.</p>
<div id="attachment_90" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/logo_ciu2.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-90" title="logo_ciu2" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/logo_ciu2.jpg?w=150&#038;h=110" alt="" width="150" height="110" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The victors</p></div>
<p>The story was rather different for the right, however. The conservative nationalist ‘Convergence and Union’ (CiU) is now just six seats short of an absolute majority, a remarkable achievement in a system of proportional representation with six to seven parties represented in the parliament. The right-wing unionist People’s Party of Catalonia (PPC), the local branch of Spain’s main centre-right party, also saw a significant increase in its vote and gained four new seats, making it Catalonia’s new third party.</p>
<p>As far as the smaller parties are concerned, the anti-nationalist ‘Citizen’s Party’ (C’s) remained unchanged on three seats, while a new radical separatist party ‘Catalan Solidarity’ (SC) founded by the former president of Barcelona FC achieved four seats. The right wing anti-immigration party ‘Platform for Catalonia’ (PxC) came very close but just missed out on winning a seat, seeing its vote share dramatically increase.</p>
<p>The future for this region is now unclear. It is almost certain that CiU will be in government, and many of its members favour independence for Catalonia, inevitably creating tensions with the government in Madrid. Although CiU is not explicitly separatist, a coalition with their fellow conservatives in the PPC seems unlikely due to the latter’s passionate unionism. There are further complications because the PPC’s mother party looks set to win the next Spanish elections in sixteen months’ time, which would put a right-wing unionist government in power in Madrid facing a separatist government in Barcelona.</p>
<div id="attachment_93" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/untitled-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-93" title="Untitled-2" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/untitled-2.jpg?w=450&#038;h=283" alt="" width="450" height="283" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Distribution of seats in the new Catalan parliament</p></div>
<p><strong>+++Update: CiU to Govern Alone+++</strong></p>
<p>It has been announced this afternoon that the centre-right CiU will not seek to form a coalition and will govern Catalonia alone as a minority government. Their spokesman, Antoni Duran i Lleida, announced that they will begin cutting taxes as well as bringing in modest austerity measures. He also ruled out holding a referendum on independence for the foreseeable future. This definitively brings to an end eight years of left-wing rule in Catalonia. CiU is a federation of two political parties: the libertarian &#8220;Democratic Union&#8221; and the more traditionally conservative &#8220;Democratic Convergence&#8221;. They will likely get most of their economic measures through parliament with the help of the conservative unionist PPC.</p>
<p><strong>The Gimmick Election</strong></p>
<p>These elections have seen more bizarre gimmicks and stunts than any before, but it seems the Catalan electorate were unimpressed. Turnout was below half despite the best efforts of politicians to make politics look fun. One of the most notable was an online game produced by the PPC in which the viewer plays the role of their leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, riding a giant seagull and shooting illegal immigrants and Catalan nationalists. The game created a storm of controversy and was eventually taken down, but you can still see it in the video below by a leftist using it to make the party look “fascist”. You can also see a Telegraph report <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/8140561/Spains-conservatives-withdraw-video-game-that-firebombs-illegal-immigrants.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another gimmick that made headlines outside of Catalonia was a video by the youth wing of the Socialists which shows a girl having an orgasm while voting. The intention was, apparently, to increase turn-out among young voters with the slogan “votar és un plaer” (voting is a pleasure). Judging by turn-out figures it only served to make them laughing stocks.</p>

<p><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/super-montilla2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-98" title="super-montilla2" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/super-montilla2.jpg?w=214&#038;h=300" alt="" width="214" height="300" /></a>The socialists also showed their humour in a poster depicting their leader, the incumbent Catalan president José Montilla, as a superman figure. The best way to describe Montilla would be to imagine a socially awkward low-grade bank clerk who was suddenly put in charge of a government. A bit like Hermann van Rompuy but with even less charisma. The socialists play on this in their poster by giving it the heading “The Incredible Ordinary Guy”, and show plain old Montilla ripping open his shirt to reveal a superman-like ‘M’ on his chest. The text below reads, “He never rests even at night! Now the metro is open 24 hours on Saturdays! He awaits new challenges!” It appears, though, Montilla wasn’t incredible enough as he’s now ex-president and his party achieved its worst result since the restoration of democracy.</p>
<p>The PSC’s humiliation was compounded last night when their spokesman Miquel Iceta was hit in the head by an egg while he admitted defeat. The protestor who threw it was a middle aged man who shouted, “¡Rojo de mierda, viva España!” For those of you who don’t speak Spanish the second part means “long live Spain!” and the first part is far too obscene to be printed in this blog. Needless to say “rojo” means “red” and “mierda” is Spanish equivalent of the French “merde”. While he was swifly ejected from the room he exclaimed, “¡me has dejado sin trabajo!” (“You have left me without work!”)</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d share with you this rarely seen documentary by Peter Hitchens, in which he gives us a history of the British Eurosceptic movement. For those of you who oppose the EU it is definitely worth watching! It&#8217;s an hour long and divided into six parts.</p>

<h2 class="storytitle" id="post-71"><a href="http://hightory.com/2010/11/26/shout-daily-mail/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Losing the argument? Shout &#8220;Daily&nbsp;Mail!&#8221;">Losing the argument? Shout &#8220;Daily&nbsp;Mail!&#8221;</a></h2>


<div class="storycontent">
<p>Watching BBC Question time last night I was annoyed by several things: Ken Clarke’s Europhilia, Kate Mosse’s vacuity and Gloria de Piero’s general existence to name but a few. However, the thing which really got my shouting at the TV screen was a question directed at Nigel Farage from a young lady, asking him whether he gets his statistics from the Daily Mail. It was delivered in typical holier-than-thou style and you could tell she’d been waiting all day, maybe all her life, to say it.</p>
<p>N<a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/images.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72" title="images" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/images.jpg?w=192&#038;h=262" alt="" width="192" height="262" /></a>ow I’m not for a moment going to glorify the Mail, after all like any High Tory I regard it as being a bit vulgar and “middle class”. I can’t stand its typical tabloid sensationalism, its fascination with vacuous celebrity and its treatment of the Royal Family as vacuous celebrities themselves. On a good day I can tolerate the journalism of the Daily Telegraph, but even then I still get annoyed at its attempts to appeal to a lower common denominator, putting high readership figures above good content. However, this is all beside the point.</p>
<p>I remember during my first year at university the debating society held a debate with the motion “This House believes Daily Mail values are bad for Britain”. The motion was miraculously defeated, and it was defeated because one of the opposition speakers reminded the audience that although they may not share the paper’s views other people do. To simply condemn and sneer at these views is to deny a (particularly passionate) section of the population their voice and may well lead to even further resentment and anger on their part.</p>
<p>It also helped that the proposition went for the typical approach of condemning the Mail by saying how many articles were against immigrants or other minorities and reading out some of the more ridiculous headlines. This was all well and good, and drew a few laughs, but they failed to point out why these views were inherently bad for society, leaving them wide open to accusations from the opposition that they were just sneering at opinions they happened to disagree with and were trying to censor other people’s views.</p>
<p>This lazy criticism of the paper has now become all too common on the left. It’s hard to listen to a Radio 4 comedy without some smug comedian getting a cheap laugh from mentioning the paper’s name. It also helps in debates, especially on shows like question time, to render someone’s opinion over-blown and unreliable by saying that it belongs in the Daily Mail. The reasoning being that if it’s something the Daily Mail would say then it must surely be nothing more than scare-mongering. This relies on the unsafe assumption that everything the Mail says is incorrect or grossly exaggerated.</p>
<p>It is therefore a truly empty criticism. The girl on Question Time last night could have asked Nigel Farage a serious question about the source of his statistics, but instead chose to be lazy and clichéd. Even if his statistics were straight from the Daily Mail that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re wrong, but just try telling that to the liberal-left. The paper has become the <em>b</em><em>ête noir</em> of Britain’s liberal élite, representing all they hate, so they must try to make it seem ridiculous. Of course the paper often helps that view with some of their articles, but that doesn’t mean all they say should be automatically derided.</p>
<p>So the lesson is clear: if you’re leftwing and want a lazy shortcut to winning an argument just accuse your opponent of reading the newspaper of doom. If you’re a trendy comedian looking for cheap laugh then just mention the title of that most hated publication and feel smug as you wallow in your sense of moral superiority. In the mean time the rest of us will concentrate on REAL arguments!</p>

<h2 class="storytitle" id="post-62"><a href="http://hightory.com/2010/11/24/a-simple-solution-to-university-funding/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: A Simple Solution to University&nbsp;Funding">A Simple Solution to University&nbsp;Funding</a></h2>


<div class="storycontent">
<p>&#8220;No ifs, not buts, no education cuts&#8221; cry the economically illiterate students protesting in London. They must be having a great time shouting obscenities, spraying graffiti and committing acts of vandalism. When they were at school they would have been punished for such behaviour, but now it&#8217;s positively encouraged. All in a good cause you know!</p>
<p>One wonders if there would be so many people protesting, or indeed if the government would be raising fees at all, if the only reasonable option were pursued: cut funding to Micky Mouse courses at substandard universities. In fact, just close or merge third rate universities. Both Labour and the Conservatives are responsible for the situation where the UK can have universities offering courses in homoeopathy and alternative medicine, or Surf Science. The Major government made the error of converting polytechnics to universities, encouraging formerly vocational institutions to offer academic courses which are quite often substandard. Then New Labour made things even worse with their policy of getting 50% of school leavers going to university; a completely arbitrary figure which encouraged those who would be better off going straight into work to take courses they were not suited to. The result was a massive drop out rate at some lower-end universities.</p>
<p>Having students at the the University of the Arse-End-of-Nowhere studying Media, Horticulture and Crystal Healing does no one any good. It does not serve the economy because it keeps so many people out of the workplace , it does not help the students because it gives them qualifications that are not worth the paper they&#8217;re written on, and it does not help the UK&#8217;s academic reputation because it diverts government funds from world leading institutions, giving their foreign competitors an advantage.</p>
<p>There is also the nonsense argument about bog standard universities increasing social mobility. Being the first person from your family to go to university is no great achievement if the entry grades are pitifully low, it offers substandard teaching and you end up with a degree not worth the parchment it&#8217;s written on. Real social mobility happens when people from poor backgrounds get into our great prestigious institutions and end up with valuable degrees after a rigorous education. That can only happen after our shocking state education system is reformed so it educates ordinary people to a satisfactory level for those institutions.</p>
<p>In the mean time if someone from a relatively poor background does not have the grades for a top university they will be better off going straight into work. They will find that they have a head start over their peers who will be wasting three years doing a non-course only to end up in the very same job that they could have entered straight from school.</p>

<p>We should have expected the great news of the Royal Wedding would prompt villainous republicans to spout their usual bile and drivel. Two such figures have contributed to debate today: the Bishop of Willesden and the Labour group leader on Bury Council.</p>
<p><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/bishop-peter-broadbent-2.jpg"></a><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/bishop-peter-broadbent-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-57" title="Bishop Peter Broadbent 2" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/bishop-peter-broadbent-2.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" alt="" width="112" height="150" /></a>The bishop, who really ought to know better, has stated on his facebook page that Prince William&#8217;s marriage will last just seven years and has called the Royal Family &#8216;philanderers&#8217; who &#8216;cost an arm and a leg&#8217;. He openly states, with even a hint a pride, that he is republican and says that on the day of the wedding he is planning a &#8216;republican trip&#8217; to France. Here&#8217;s a suggestion: if he wants to live in a republic so badly then why not make his trip and not bother coming back? Britain is a monarchy and is all the better for it and those who refuse to recognise the sovereign as their head of state do not deserve the privilege of living here.<a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/6a00d83451b31c69e20133f6459ff3970b.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-58 alignright" title="6a00d83451b31c69e20133f6459ff3970b" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/6a00d83451b31c69e20133f6459ff3970b.png?w=123&#038;h=139" alt="" width="123" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>Then there is the case of Mike Connolly, the Labour group leader on Bury Council, who has called the royals &#8216;parasites&#8217; and says they have &#8216;no relevance at all&#8217;. He has been rightly condemned by his Tory and Lib Dem colleagues but has yet to issue an apology. Plus, he is also wrong: the only parasites in this country are those who live here but fail to respect its heritage and traditions and refuse to respect its most senior family.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise to anyone that both of these people are, or have been, active members of the Labour Party. The party that once, and to an extent still does, stand for class-spite and hatred and jealously of those who are richer than or senior to oneself (or &#8220;socialism&#8221; as they call it), and now embody the anti-British Guardian reading metropolitan élite. It is true that there used to be die-hard socialists who were none-the-less patriotic and loyal to Queen and country, but they have all but died out to be replaced by disgraceful republicans like the two people above.</p>
<p>So should they consider their positions? Of course! Should they consider emigrating to a country whose system of government they don&#8217;t despise, leaving the rest of us happy with our great monarchy? Definitely! Will they actually do these things? Of course they won&#8217;t!</p>
<p>They will remain in place, as subversive agitators who all decent people should shun.</p>

<p>Today is a day to feel sorry for those who hold genuine hereditary baronies that their noble rank should be so devalued by the latest load of party cronies, media luvvies and talentless celebrities created life peers. The 54 new barons and bar0nesses include 27 Conservatives, 15 Liberal Democrats, 10 Labour, 1 Plaid Cymru and 1 Crossbencher.</p>
<p>Among the new Conservative peers are Michael Grade, most notable for dumbing-down Channel 4 to the point where journalist Paul Johnson described him as &#8220;pornographer-in-chief&#8221;. Also included are major party donors Bob Edmiston, Sir Michael Bishop and Stanley Fink; whoever said that you can&#8217;t buy a peerage?</p>
<p>The new Liberal Democrats include several constitutional philistines who have previously called for an elected House of Lords, including former Richmond MP Susan Kramer (one wonders if they&#8217;ll still say that now they have a seat for life!).</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Labour ranks include major party donor Sir Gulam Noon, a curry tycoon who has donated £737,826 to the party over the past decade, although of course that must surely be a happy coincidence!</p>
<p>One wonders if this is the coalition government&#8217;s final spit in the face of Lord&#8217;s before they wreck (sorry &#8220;reform&#8221;) what&#8217;s left of it by trying to introduce elected peers. We must hope that right-minded peers are still in the majority and block such nonsense, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>When the new peers take their seats the composition of the House of Lords will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labour 250 (including 4 hereditary)</li>
<li>Conservative 220 (including 48 hereditary)</li>
<li>Crossbench 182 (including 32 hereditary)</li>
<li>Liberal Democrat 94 (including 5 hereditary)</li>
<li>Lords Spiritual 25</li>
<li>Democratic Unionists 4</li>
<li>Ulster Unionists 3</li>
<li>UKIP 2 (including 1 hereditary)</li>
<li>Plaid Cymru 1</li>
<li>Non-affiliated 17 (including 1 hereditary)</li>

<h2 class="storytitle" id="post-35"><a href="http://hightory.com/2010/11/11/cf-weakness/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Student Protests &#8211; A Weak Response From&nbsp;CF">Student Protests &#8211; A Weak Response From&nbsp;CF</a></h2>


<div class="storycontent">
<p>Despite the best efforts of the Labour Party-supporting NUS President to downplay yesterday&#8217;s violence as the actions of a small minority, MPs have criticised the poor planning of yesterday&#8217;s protest.</p>
<p>In an emergency debate called by Policing Minister Nick Herbet MPs such as Nadine Dorries, Peter Bottomley and Claire Elphicke cited the large amount of video and photographic evidence that shows thousands of protesters engaged in violent acts and cheering on others. Meanwhile NUS Stewards are clearly making no effort to stop it. <a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/demo-lition.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-40" title="demo-lition" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/demo-lition.jpg?w=196&#038;h=171" alt="" width="196" height="171" /></a></p>
<p>There have now been calls from several blogs and from London&#8217;s LBC radio for the NUS President to resign. It is very clear from the NUS branding for the event, done in a typical lefty student activist style, that &#8216;direct action&#8217; would be incited. The protest itself was called &#8220;Demo-lition&#8221;!</p>
<p>However one of the most striking things about these events is the lacklustre response from Conservative Future. After their party HQ has been invaded and had a great deal of criminal damage caused to it by members of an organisation with which they say they want to &#8220;work closely&#8221;, there has been little said. The CF official website now has a very short statement on the protests and the National Chairman, until mid-afternoon today, condemned the actions only in a Facebook status &#8211; visible only to people who happen to be his friends. The statement (posted at about 3pm today) calls for &#8220;swift action&#8221; to taken against NUS officers who played their part, but no word on the thousand-strong rabble. Nothing is said of CF&#8217;s future relations with the NUS.</p>
<p>This shows extremely weak leadership on two counts. First of all CF are they youth wing of the party in government and so is aimed at the same age group as the protesters. There will no doubt be a great many students who are disgusted by the violence, and yet they find a pretty meek voice from the youth wing of the party to which that violence was directed.</p>
<p>Secondly, any organisation which had such violent acts committed against it by members of another organisation would rightly cut all links with that organisation until it at least had an apology. There has been no apology for the damage caused to CCHQ, and yet CF has taken no real action. I think I speak for a great many young Conservative Party members when I say that Conservative Future should have absolutely nothing to do with the NUS in future, and for the CF executive, cutting all dealing with the NUS should be a no-brainer.</p>
<p>So where are Conservative Future? Why was there a delay in a public, official response? From here it looks like poor, indecisive leadership, and that they&#8217;re letting the vandals off the hook.</p>

<div class="storycontent">
<p>Why can these so called students not even spell the words on their placards correctly?</p>
<p>How does smashing windows and invading buildings help their cause?</p>
<p>Why do so many people even need to go to university? Apprenticeships and job training are good alternatives. We currently have such a shortage of trained manual workers that we need to get immigrants to come in and do those jobs.</p>
<p>We all know what they’re against, but how about what they’d do instead of raising fees?</p>
<p>It seems to me these are some over-excited kids who don’t really know the intricate details of what they’re protesting about.</p>

<h2 class="storytitle" id="post-23"><a href="http://hightory.com/2010/11/09/ukip-or-not-ukip/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: UKIP or not UKIP? The dilemma of a Right-Wing&nbsp;Tory">UKIP or not UKIP? The dilemma of a Right-Wing&nbsp;Tory</a></h2>


<div class="storycontent">
<p>Like many on the right of the Conservative Party I have been sceptical of Cameron and the Notting Hill set for a while. It seems that<a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/david-cameron-880207022.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27" title="david-cameron-880207022" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/david-cameron-880207022.jpg?w=216&#038;h=156" alt="Cameron Airbrished" width="216" height="156" /></a> the party has been taken over by careerist apparatchiks who masquerade as conservative in order to reach high office. Take today’s revelations on the <a href="http://bit.ly/akgggD" target="_blank">Guido Fawkes blog</a> as an example. Cameron’s cronies are shamelessly given well paid civil service jobs as rewards for their loyalty to him.</p>
<p>Another example is Cameron’s youth wing ‘Conservative Future’. <a href="http://www.conservativefuture.com/2010/11/08/coopt-elections-candidates-announced/" target="_blank">Candidates have been announced</a> for the position of “campaign co-ordinator”. The only people eligible to vote in this election are members of the National Executive and Regional chairmen; in other words ordinary members have no say. Many of the candidates also happen to be personal friends of the National Chairman. A coincidence I’m sure!</p>
<p>This blatant cronyism, which puts loyalty and sycophancy before genuine conservative belief and talent, may just be tolerable if the party leadership had some right-wing backbone to them. Instead we see Cameron surrendering more money to the EU, refusing to fight against an ECHR verdict that prisoners should have to right to vote, ring-fencing the international aid budget while slashing the armed forces, keeping Harriet Harman’s dreadful and destructive ‘Equalities Act’, and caving in to the dogmatic nonsense of an elected House of Lords.</p>
<p><a href="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ukip.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-28" title="Ukip" src="http://hightory.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ukip.jpg?w=180&#038;h=166" alt="UKIP Logo" width="180" height="166" /></a>In light of all this many Conservatives are starting to feel out of place in their own party and are looking across to a party where they may feel more at home. That party is almost always the United Kingdom Independence Party. UKIP is certainly unequivocal on its position on the EU: get out, and do it as soon as possible! Of course that’s only one issue, but a look at <a href="http://www.ukip.org/media/policies/UKIPManifestoWeb.pdf" target="_blank">their manifesto from the last general election</a> reveals a whole raft of policies where they seem more in tune with Conservative voters than the Conservative party itself, such as building more prisons, a five-year freeze on immigration, and encouraging the creation of new grammar schools.</p>
<p>So it seems for a disaffected Conservative jumping ship to UKIP might be the obvious choice. There is, however, a problem. While UKIP have made significant gains in European elections, under the FPTP system used in for Westminster elections they have virtually no chance of taking a seat in the near future. The Westminster electoral system perpetuates our three-party system making it very difficult for a new party to gain ground, save by mass defection of sitting MPs (cf. Social Democrats), and even then there is no guarantee of long term success (cf. Social Democrats).</p>
<p>This means that the more right-wing Conservatives defect to UKIP, the more the Conservative Party becomes a bland pseudo-leftwing Cameroon organisation, thus depriving mainstream British politics of a real right-wing alternative. So maybe the best thing to do is stay put and fight our corner in the Conservative party. A right-of-centre anti-Cameron take over within the party could have a much greater impact on the future of our country than a swelling of the UKIP membership. Of course UKIP is always a temptation with their genuine small-‘c’ conservative policies and their charismatic no-nonsense leader, but if the Tories are left to their fate and then continue to win elections under the current system we could witness the total removal of genuine conservative thought from British political discourse.</p>
<p>So for the time being I, at least, will be keeping my Conservative Party membership, but only in the hope that one day soon Cameron and his cronies will swept on to the ash-heap of history. In fact I endeavour to make it so.</p>
