<div class="content"><p><img src="http://www.computeraudiophile.com/files/lrsss.jpg" /></p>
<p>Artist: Various </p>
<p>Title: Super Audio Surround Collection Volume 3 - Linn Records<br />
 <br />
Genre: iTunes says Classical, but there is some Jazz, Chorale, Rock, Acoustic, and Jazzy Latin-style stuff on here too.<br />
 <br />
Good song to sample: He Never Mentioned Love, Paganini-Grande Etudes (III) (really, just pick a song and go if you have broad tastes - I like them all)</p>
<p>Similar artists: Various and too many to mention</p>
<p>Interesting notes: 270 minute download at broadband speed (4 - 8:30 pm) - only $13.50 for some very good performances - The computer was completely able to surf the web or play music while downloading ( OS X Tiger/Core 2 Duo @ 2.4 Ghz/ 2Gb Ram) - ALWAYS BE SURE that your audio hardware and the computer's preferences are set to 24 bit / 96 KHz ( or a setup matching the source ) when you venture above the 'standard' audio resolutions in order to actually 'hear' it properly!</p>
<p>Recording quality: 24 bit / 96 KHz Master Quality FLAC<br />
 <br />
Comments: I've had to listen to it for a 2nd and then 3rd time to really appreciate the sound that seems to me to be as true to the instruments and voices used here as any recording I've ever heard. My first listen left me thinking it had no life: just sort of flat.... I now think my first impression was dead wrong - I wasn't really listening, it appears to me now, because each new listen (iTunes says 5 now) reveals another nuance I had missed before. This recording is really incredible. Except for some electronic music passages, I can detect no coloration except those afforded by the voice of the instruments or the recording spaces themselves. Not all of the music here may be your cup of tea, but there are several types to choose from. I came to see and hear the great 24/96 audio download promise of the future and came away with a growing admiration for Linn Records and the artists they associate with. Wow.</p>

<p>Artist: Metallica w/ San Francisco Symphony</p>
<p>Title: S&amp;M (live double disc)</p>
<p>Genre: Metal</p>
<p>Good song to sample: The Call Of The Ktulu</p>
<p>Similar artists: Megadeth, Black Sabbath, Motörhead</p>
<p>Interesting notes: This was conducted by composer Michael Kamen (1948-2003) who collaborated on The Wall with Pink Floyd and with Queen, Eric Clapton, Roger Daltrey, Aerosmith, Tom Petty, David Bowie, Eurythmics, Queensrÿche, Rush, Herbie Hancock, The Cranberries, Bryan Adams, Sting and Kate Bush.</p>
<p>Recording quality: CD ripped to AIFF 16/44.1, it sounds pretty good. Probably 7 out of 10.</p>
<p>Comments: I was skeptical of this release at first but the more I listen to it the more I like it.</p>

<div class="my-own 	 "><a href="/content/Im-Listening#comment-380" class="active">&quot;A Sea Symphony&quot;</a></div>


<div class="content"><p>A friend introduced me to the music of Ralph Vaughan Williams back in the mid-1970s. Until then I'd not heard any 20th-century music that I liked. Since then I've collected quite a few CDs, and one of my favorites is "A Sea Symphony," his first.</p>
<p>Artist: London Philharmonic Orchestra, Adrian Boult<br />
Title: "A Sea Symphony"<br />
Genre:  Classical<br />
Good song to sample: Right from the start.<br />
Similar artists: Elgar, Grieg<br />
Interesting notes: Boult recorded this twice. This is the 1968 one. The newer one is said to be better in some ways but I've not heard it.<br />
Recording quality: Very good. (London/EMI)<br />
Comments: Music by Ralph Vaughan Williams. Text by Walt Whitman. The two disparate mediums are woven beautifully together. It's a unique work. At the time I bought this (1985 or thereabouts) this was the only version available. Now there are some others but this one is still respected.</p>

<p>Artist: Pearl Jam<br />
Title: Riot Act<br />
Genre: Rock<br />
Good song to sample: Save You (see video)<br />
Similar artists: I suppose all the seattle / grunge bands, but Pearl Jam is beyond that now<br />
Interesting notes: As with all Pearl Jam releases Riot Act is available on vinyl<br />

<div class="my-own 	 "><a href="/content/Im-Listening#comment-419" class="active">SPIRIT - Twelve Dreams Of Dr. Sardonicus</a></div>


<div class="content"><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Spirit.JPG" /></p>
<p>Artist: Spirit<br />
Title: Twelve Dreams Of Dr. Sardonicus <br />
Genre: iTunes says Rock. I think of it as "Spiritual" <br />
Good song to sample: From Prelude/Nothing to Hide through Soldier, it IS ALL GOOD<br />
Similar artists: None, really. They combined Jazz and Rock sensibilities with the 'Psychedelic-sound wave'  that had just 'crested'. I really cannot compare them to anyone else<br />
Interesting notes: Amazingly to me, this band never "made it big". There are varying explanations, but I think the one that might be most true is that there was just so much talent in this band that the egos involved were too much to have peacefully coexisted for a long time. <br />
Recording quality: Vinyl - very well done (I have the CD with extra tracks too, but......)<br />
Comments: To this day, I tell people who ask "what was the best show you ever saw?" - 'Spirit'. Country Joe and the Fish opened, and then Spirit TOOK OVER. I could say something really emotional here about my love for this band, but I won't. I will say that I think this recording ranks equally with pieces like Electric Ladyland, Dark Side Of the Moon, and Tommy. It is classic rock from the period of that genre' where it meant the most.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Ditto for vinyl Best of Spirit, 1973.  I love these songs.  I got to see them once in the early 70's, I'm thinking 71 or 72, but I was seeing Jo Jo Gunne too, so at least Ferguson and Andes had left the band.  I'm going to hunt a copy of your album.  I love these songs.  Did I say I love this stuff?</p>

<div class="content"><p>You did say you love this stuff so I'd highly recommend any of their 'original band' records ( in order: Spirit, The Family That Plays Together, Clear AND 12 Dreams) - Hell, I like a lot of the stuff from the other band lineups too.  I recently was pointed to an online vinyl retailer from whom I have bought a couple of records. So far, they are reasonably priced and ship quickly. My most recent purchase there - the soundtrack to "Model Shop" - previously unreleased and done by Spirit. Check it out:<br />

<div class="content"><p>This is one of the most incredibly mesmerizing albums I've ever heard. My first exposure to it was in that NPR program called Hearts of Space that aired back in the eighties. Generally speaking, this is not the kind of music I enjoy, but Stomu Yamashta continues to draw me in like no other who is generally thought of in this new age genre.</p>
<p>Coupled to that are some truly incredible sonics with wide dynamic range and frequency bandwidth.</p>
<p>Your chances of finding a copy? Slim and none. It took me nearly a year to find mine, and that was 24 years ago.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Cool Steven! I HAVE to hear this! I became a Stomu fan back .....well, a long time ago. He release an album with Steve Winwood called 'GO', I believe. I had forgotten about that until I saw this  here. While I've always been a fan of atmospheric electronica and related styles (I'm a TOTAL Tangerine Dream fan), I do have to admit that it can be difficult to find 'replayable' pieces in that genre'.</p>
<p>Dang you and your collection anyway! 8^P</p>

<div class="content"><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b1/Underwater_Sunlight.png" /></p>
<p>Artist: Tangerine Dream <br />
Title: Underwater Sunlight <br />
Genre: Electronica / Atmospheric<br />
Good song to sample: Underwater Twilight - but this is another that is all good <br />
Similar artists: I dunno: Kraftwerk or Pink Floyd <br />
Interesting notes: These guys and their ideas for the future of quality sound were a very important 'testing ground' for helping software coders to develop many of the computer software tools that are used to produce music today. And they could really "bring it" in a live situation too. <br />
Comments: Huge library of work dating back to the 1960s. Edgar Frose' is a classically trained pianist</p>

<div class="my-own 	 "><a href="/content/Im-Listening#comment-712" class="active">My favorite pop album of all time...</a></div>


<div class="content"><p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/616WPNRFDXL._AA240_.jpg" /></p>
<p>I've just loaded this into my iTunes library via Roxio Toast.</p>
<p>Ever since the vinyl days, this has been a record that I can listen to over and over. It's simply the best concept album ever done that would mate a (then) contemporary artist with classic tunes from previous decades. Many people fail to recognize the (well-intended) humor in Harry's presentation and in the revised lyrics, but in essence, the album is a tribute to the trials involved in love affairs that sometimes go wrong — note the chronology from beginning to end. As the final tune on the album states so sublimely, the more things change, the more they remain the same: "The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by."</p>
<p>Much of the success of this album comes from the genius of Gordon Jenkins whose orchestrations perfectly fit the mood that he, as arranger and programmer for Nilsson, and Nilsson's subdued presentation evoke. To hear this album as it deserves to be heard, grab your sweetheart and some nice wine, turn down the lights, and let Harry work his magic. Easily one of my two or three favorite albums of all time.</p>
<p>The sound is absolutely superb <strong>but sounds the best on the British release</strong> <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xapbr" title="http://tinyurl.com/2xapbr">http://tinyurl.com/2xapbr</a></p>

<p>Guess I'm cheating a little since I'm not listening at this exact moment, but did you catch them on CMT live the other night?  I loved it.  Alison sang When the Levee Breaks, duets on Gone, Gone, Gone and Black Dog, Rob sang Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn.  Great show I thought.  Band was hot, more of a Strange Sensation vibe rather than Union Station.  Some short interview info mixed in with the songs.  I'll watch it a few more times fou shou.</p>
<p>Edit - well I talked myself into it.  Chattanooga show is single tics only left, no good with wife.  Most of Europe shows look sold out.  We could do Wembley from Amsterdam by coincidence.  So, let's see, we're going to West Virginia from Florida and Alabama is now the detour stop on 4/26.  They still have good seats, but 2 fewer for the Birmingham show than before this post.  I should have followed my gut and done this a month ago.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Chris' review of that great Coltrane album the other day got me to thinking about some of my favorite albums by horn players, and, now that the downloading to the library is going full tilt again, I had to stop and just listen to this one after it loaded. Surprisingly enough, it's Burrell and Jackson that make this one so exciting; Hawk is just great as usual.</p>
<p>Nice clear sound, but with that fifties hole in the middle stereo so common back then. </p>
<p>I sincerely apologize for the absurd prices for this on Amazon, but this is what to expect when you want to buy something world class after it goes OOP. :-(</p>

<p><img src="http://www.computeraudiophile.com/files/delp.jpeg" /></p>
<p>"Rockin’ Away was written in the summer of 2006 for the 30th Anniversary of the release of the first “Boston” record. It was the last song that Brad and I wrote together. In it, Brad reflects on how he became involved in music, and thanks his many fans for their years of loyalty. It was my hope that the song might lead to a rekindling of my relationship with the band. Unfortunately it did not. Brad’s family and I felt that his many fans would appreciate hearing his spectacular voice one more time on a new song. I hope that you enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoyed making it." - Barry Goudreau</p>

<p>The Amazing Bud Powell, Volume 1, Blue Note</p>
<p>I am very happy that Chris has found a few of my recommendations to his liking, so maybe this time I'll switch over to a jazz keyboard player who can really get that toe of his to tapping. </p>
<p>Of course, if the Creator gave us the saxophone so that everybody would enjoy jazz, then the piano had to come along too, just to entice those who wanted more into a whole different approach. </p>
<p>You don't hear much about Bud Powell in audiophile circles these days, probably because these mono recordings were made prior to wider bandwidth recrordings; but he is in that same pantheon with players like Bill Evans whose innovation and, for lack of a better word, soulful playing, distinguish him as a true artistic genius, and not just another skilled craftsman.  No one can instill such persona into such rapid playing — not even Lennie Tristano who made one of the most important jazz recordings ever — and no other jazz pianist has been so blatantly imitated. </p>
<p>The entire Amazing series pairs Bud with many other jazz greats of his era, and despite his short life. Read the Amazon customer reviews to learn lots more than I'll ever know. Powell is a true jazz icon.</p>

<div class="content"><p>I listen to lots of things but have been doing a lot of jazz lately.  There is a brand new one by Jimmy Bruno, who is this freak of nature on archtop jazz guitar.  The new one, titled Maplewood Avenue is much quieter than some of his predecessors.  My favorite is "Like That".  Amazing chops, fairly traditional fare and the incomparable Joey DeFrancesco on B3.  </p>
<p>My other recent discovery is Anthony Wilson.  He plays in Diana Krall's band but he has more depth on his own - gotta pay the bills, I guess.  Savivity and Power of Nine are two of his recent ones.  He is a fine player but has his ego well in hand.  More of an ensemble sort of thing.  A friend of mine, Joe Harley from Audioquest Records produced all of Anthony's recordings, so I may be prejudiced but Joe is a superb producer and the sound is very natural.  Stereophile wrote up a piece on the production of Power of Nine last year.  Not the typical audiophile sonic extravaganza but very natural and the better your system the more music you hear.</p>

<p>This is a great album and it reminds me of an interview I read with Alison a few years ago.  She was asked what she listened to.  She was kind of sheepish, and very cute, and answered that she was heavily into Metallica at the moment.   Cracked me up.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Ok, markr, I'm confused.</p>
<p>By the way I picked up the new Eagles tonight.  Haven't had a chance to hear it yet.  I know I have asked this before, but I steadfastly claim my right to be slow.  If I am using iTunes to play everything, which I am to keep things simple for me at this stage, can I download the high rez stuff?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<div class="content"><p>Well, I didn’t have good luck with SoundStage Direct.  Placed order for some goodies including Spirit and MC5 lps on 1/21.  Early Feb, I inquired and they said backordered, but would ship in 2 groups with most going out immediately (this was after days of calling a phone that never was answered).  When I finally got thru the fellow acted surprised.  Today, 2/26 I called to inquire since nothing has arrived and I see my shipment is still pending, no phone answer again, this time the voice mailbox is full and not accepting messages.  </p>
<p>I contacted AMEX to cancel.  I’d be careful with this place – something smells fishy.  Too bad, great prices and selections.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Sorry for the bad 'pointer'. They did me right three times in a row, so I don't know what is going on over there. I hope the economy didn't kill them.... I need to call my buddy in San Antonio that turned me on to SoundStage - he told me just this last weekend that he was getting ready to order some new vinyl replacements. He is the type of person who would send a money order too.... Jeez.</p>
<p>Thanks for the 'heads up'!<br />

<div class="content"><p>Sorry that I missed this at the time you sent it Rick. - I haven't fully trained myself to use the "TRACK" function under "MY ACCOUNT" on this website yet..... So what do you think of the Long Road Out of Eden so far?...</p>
<p><strong>I haven't yet had a problem playing back audio resolutions up to 24/96 with iTunes. I haven't tried anything of a higher resolution yet either. I don't have any material above 24/96 TO try at this point, but I could generate some when I get some time if you are interested..... When you have the download, most are FLAC at this point, you can then convert that lossless file to whatever resolution that your conversion program can accomplish. I like 'Max' for the Mac. Just looking at it right now, it will convert to AIF at up to 32bit. Max doesn't have a switch to set the sampling 'rate', so I assume that that is dependent on the original file to be converted.</strong></p>
<p>You probably know this by now (Chris is QUICK), but -<br />
The key here is to set "Audio MIDI Setup" in the Utilities folder to the resolution that you want to play back BEFORE opening iTunes. You can also successfully 'upsample' your lower resolution stuff to say... 24/96. That is, just leave it set to 24/96 all the time. Chris LOVES that (..ahem)! I find it 'interesting' so far, though I don't do it all the time by any means.</p>
<p>- on my computer the audio setup proceedure is somewhat more complicated, because the RME A/D/A has a separate audio setup utility that can be set differently than Audio MIDI is. This RME application - or the presence of the RME box - also effects the Audio MIDI menu too....  add in 96 MIDI channels too and it can get confusing quickly. For now, i'll spare you the story about how I found out about the audio settings 'feature' while I was writing a piece of music the other day.....<br />

<div class="content"><p>I think it is actually BETTER than what Steven says. It IS an amazingly broad expression of music both as a performance and a recording. While the version that I managed to acquire is a remaster that was released on the W. German label "Kuckuck" rather than original Japanese one that Steven has, I find this one more than satisfying.</p>

<div class="content"><p>It wouldn't surprise me if the original Japanese release doesn't just knock this one for a loop. The Germans have a strange way of adding some sort of electrical signature to the highest frequencies that isn't quite detectable until you hear something done elsewhere. I'll have to confess that back in the vinyl days, I often questioned the ability of the Japanese to press a musical sounding record, although there's no doubt that they usually had quiet surfaces.</p>
<p>As far as digital is concerned, there is no question that Japanese imports generally are more revealing, with quite a bit more in the micro-dynamics arena. I once insisted to a friend that you needed a full-range speaker in order to hear the full dynamics of a clarinet, and I'll add that these micro-dynamics on the best of the Japanese disks require very wide bandwidth to appreciate to the fullest. Lots of amp power too. If you have this kind of setup <cite>Sea And Sky</cite> can absolutely floor you. There is much more going on here than most listeners could ever imagine. Yes indeed, Stomu at his best, and not just as a musician.</p>

<div class="content"><p>I should quickly add here that it 'sounds' pointless to me to convert a lossless source file to any .aif / .wav resolution higher than the one that the lossless file was originally encoded in. That is, there is no discernible improvement in sound when converting to a higher resolution as far as I can tell. You just get a bigger .aif file with no actual audio information in the extra space that is taken up.</p>

<div class="content"><p>I just heard from my friend in San Antonio re: SD. They contacted him yesterday and apologized for not being able to get the 200 gram vinyl of Who's Next that he had ordered, credited his account for it and and shipped the rest of his order with a gratis 150 gram copy of Who's Next added. It sounds like they want to please, but are having some issues in doing so.  It would be so great if these guys can work out their 'kinks'.</p>
<p>Keeping my fingers crossed and getting ready to order the vinyl of SGB's recommended - Billie Holiday's Songs for Distingué Lovers (VSCD 6021) - wish me luck. </p>

<div class="content"><p>I had a look for myself and agree overpriced is the correct adjective. Without more information about each album it is impossible to tell what you're getting. Just the title and artist don't really cut it for me since there are so many remasters and releases of many of the albums.</p>
<p>Cool that he is selling them however.</p>

<p>Well, while I don't know that much about all the versions, I grab em at 2 or 4 for a buck.  That's my typical price range for used vinyl.  If I'm really lusting I break out the wallet and pay a dollar.  Am I garage sale cheap or what???</p>

When the majority of this stuff is available as high resolution downloads I will be so poor!

<div class="content"><p>If you are an old guy like me, you probably already know this, but for all the young'uns that congregate here, this is a little known fact. Astrid's voice should be coming from your left channel in "Girl From Ipanema," but nearly every release has her coming from the right. Of course, if you are lucky enough to have the MoFi version, then you really do have the correct channel orientation.</p>
<p>Right now I'm listening to Steve Hoffman's great job on this one:</p>

<div class="content"><p>How do you know this stuff SGB?!!!!</p>
<p>Now I have to look for the MoFi version. I listened to mine and her voice is in the right channel on the first version and there is another version of the song called the 45 RPM Issue that has her voice centered. </p>
<p>Great, SGB has contributed to my wallet thinning out once again :-)</p>

<div class="content"><p>let. The MoFi version does sound very good, but so does the very first, USA CD release of G/G with the correct channel positions. There are also at least two Astrid Gilberto compilations on the Verve label that have Astrid where she belongs: Compact Jazz &amp; the Silverline collection. Finding the album length version in Mono is even harder... only 1 that I know of... Bachelor Pad Pleasures.</p>

<p>But right now, it is a beautiful cool evening in Kansas City, the doors are open, the stereo is off and I am listening to the gentle sounds of nature.  Sometimes I tend to forget the basics.... like how grateful I am for the ability to hear reasonably well as I progress into middle age.</p>

<div class="content"><p>I just spotted this.  Talk about being slow.  I am totally in the dark about much of the download process.  I have about 300gig of material stored but all except one album has been from my own CD's.  The exception is a Bruce Cocburn album, "You've Never Seen Everything".  I have a lovely empty CD case.  I think whoever ripped it off took about six of my socks that I can't find the matches for as well.  Pervert.  At any rate, I downloaded it from the iTunes store and vowed never to do that again.  Perhaps if Chris is monitoring we could get a tutorial on how to address the download issue when using iTunes outside of the iTunes store.  I'm serious, I am totally clueless.  I used to download in MP3 from emusic but that was to have a copy of jazz tunes I was learning on guitar.</p>
<p>If this has been covered, my apologies but I didn't find it.  I'm not sure I want iTunes upsampling my music.  I find I am agreeing with Gordon about trying to leave the native resolution alone.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<div class="content"><p>Artist: Paul Winter (and a coterie of birds)<br />
Title: "Canyon Lullaby"<br />
Genre: Wonderful<br />
Good song to sample: "Canyon Chaconne"<br />
Similar artists: Pat Metheny, sort of...<br />
Interesting notes: Great mix of alto saxophone and ambient birds<br />
Recording quality: Very good<br />
Comments: When I need something worth listening to but not jangling nor demanding, I listen to this. Winter's sax playing is flowing, not harsh, virtuoso but not showing off. Winter is always interesting. I'm a newcomer to his music and am glad I made it.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>I notice that a great deal of the music listened to and actively pursued in this forum is either jazz, rock or folk.</p>
<p>My own taste in music is exceptionally wide ranging and my music collection reflects this.</p>
<p>I would like to introduce you all to a particularly sublime disc that completely embodies the the catch phrase of this forum - Turn down the silence - knowing that for many of you listening to this disc will be a "first-time" experience. For many it will be a lasting impression. For some it will be almost religious. A few will hate it.</p>
<p>This supremely gentle music is a testament to the greatness of the composer, the performers, and the engineer. What at first listen appears to be such a simple "tune" has a depth beyond measure. Just listen (if you must dissect) to the way Vladimir Spivakov caresses the strings of his violin in extreme pianissimo!</p>
<p>The disc in question is "Alina".<br />
The composer is Arvo Pärt</p>
<p>The link to the recording follows.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/New_Series/1500/1591.php?cat=&amp;we_start=0&amp;lvredir=712&amp;we_search=%2Balina" title="http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/New_Series/1500/1591.php?cat=&amp;we_start=0&amp;lvredir=712&amp;we_search=%2Balina">http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/New_Series/1500/1591.php?cat=&amp;we_sta...</a></p>
<p>Please do not attempt to listen to this with any distractions or ambient noise.</p>
<p>I believe that even staunch rockers will find the experience of this music uplifting to say the least.</p>
<p>Peace :)</p>

<div class="content"><p>... HAVE to assume this will be interesting. I do not see this particular album available at their website. Also, the album that they do show doesn' appear to be available in anything higher resolution that 16/44.1 - Were you hinting by the "Master Tapes 24/88.2 killer!!" line that that resolution might be available? I believe that I would jump on it in a second. Where to go to get this?</p>

<div class="content"><p>Since I loaded a bunch of disks onto the nas, I've played a couple I hadn't heard in a while and that I'm listening to again after some years.</p>
<p>1. Sade - Promise:  her second album, from around '85, another platinum seller.  Enjoying the bass and sax work, plus the cool, sultry vocals that are her signature.</p>
<p>2. Robbie Robertson - Storyville:  his second solo album, from '91.  I remember hearing it the first time and having it grow on me with subsequent playings.  From RS -  "Rolling Stone (10/31/91) - 4.5 Stars - Excellent Plus - "...a mature and masterful work that lends additional luster to the formidable legacy Robertson shaped with The Band...an imaginative and spiritual journey, with New Orleans as its inspiration...a transporting, sinuous groove..."<br />
Uncut (p.119) - 4 stars out of 5 -- "[A]n intricate, unsung masterpiece, a sweeping homage to New Orleans, a musical conjuring of the spirits, with funky horns, smoky melodies, and Robertson's best singing ever."</p>
<p>I agree.</p>

<div class="my-own 	 "><a href="/content/Im-Listening#comment-3372" class="active">Well, I&#039;m listending to all</a></div>


<div class="content"><p>Well, I'm listending to all kinds of new stuff.  Bought another CD collectiion over the weekend.  90 cd's for about 30 bucks it worked out to be.  Right now, I'm listening to Spyro Gyra Featuring Jay Beckenstein, next up is Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade.  I've never heard of a lot of the music, but I'm going to broaden my horizons.  Well I actually spent $120, at a couple sales, but I also got a drill press, a Delta bandsaw, some looooong kwik clamps and a box full of twine, string, plant stakes, a silver big pyrex ancient warming dish,  a zillion cloth napkins, ye ole candle, a huge bag full of ribbon (WAF) and lots of general junk.  Do I sound like a pack rat?</p>
<p>Oh, we rode our bicycles to the first sale, I was riding an ole Raleigh 3-speed (another 10 dollar garage sale find).  It has an English Brooks leather saddle which sat unused in Florida storage for decades at least.  Well, just as I pulled into their driveway, "CLINK".  I looked down and the front bolt and a couple inches of the seat was on the driveway.  Hey!  I'm not that fat!!!  Well, the seat was shot and the first box I looked in had a bike seat for 2 bucks.  I am now riding on a new no-name seat, great timing!  I'm learning a lot about bike repairs (unfortunately I fear).</p>
<p>From the airbook I have written in my mind titled, "Tips From A Cheap-O" - when people have a couple cds for sale, they usually say 2 bucks a piece.  I say how much for all of them and they go silent in calculation (some actually go pale obviously having never made it past basic math.  Advanced cyphering puts them in a coma like state).  Often, their answer is hollered, "Hon, can you get me anuther Bud?  I usally offer around 30-50 cents each for all.  Sometimes I pay around a buck if I really like the genre.  The pitfall is some are scratched, some have no sleeves, etc, and sometimes there a few homemade ones slipped in there.  But at that rate, I assume 80% will be useable.  Out of the 90 I think they are all playable, but maybe 15-20 have nothing but the disk.  The real rate of defects is very low if playability is the main criteria.  I probably am under 1% rejection rate.</p>
<p>Oh, here's another tidbit to ponder.  Depending on your actual tax circumstance when you file, donations are one of the things that usually they don't throttle you back on.  Those LPs and CDs (using Turbo tax De-deductIT, if donated to say Goodwill, might be worth 3-5 bucks each.  At say a 25% incremental tax rate, that donation gives you maybe a buck or a little more.  That's what LPs tend to sell for at garage sales (I'm not talking collector grade stuff here).  Point being, dropping stuff off at your local fav charity might make as much coin as your own sale, and it's one HECK of a lot easier!  You probably knew that so I'm lecturing the choir here.  </p>
<p>Disclaimer - I'm not a CPA and this advice is worth what you paid for it.  I could never sit through 30 or so hours of accounting class (unless I had really good, small headphones).</p>
<p>Now, if I could just find a really great garage sale Cyclocross bike to ride to work...</p>
<p>Happy listening and junk hunting.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Hey airdronian, I saw the Dan of Steel at that venue, which is called The Gorge.  Awe inspiring place to see shows.  So I was pretty excited when I saw the cover, but I think the liner notes say that the recording was done at several other venues, if I'm not mistaken and which you probably knew.  But nonetheless a great listen.  The backup singers doing the "you got to shake it baby, you got to shake it..." in Babylon Sister is very cool.  </p>
<p>Where did you camp?</p>
<p>A recommendation along those lines, if you don't already have it, is Fagen's recent effort, Morph the Cat.  Some very funky stuff with really great production in the recording.  </p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<div class="content"><p>Hey back - I've learned of Morph the Cat but not heard it.  DF has a trilogy of albums (Nightfly<a fav>, Kamakiriad, and Morph) in the MVI format. MVI - there is another thread topic.</a></p>
<p>You always get great musicians with SD - the Two Against Nature release was a case in point - horns and vocals.</p>
<p>I forget the name of the campground, we are WH associate members.  It was at Crescent Bar, near Quincy, WA.  We had 35C in the day and 22C at night - I didn't care about the breeze, it was WARM.  </p>
<p>I think I read that SD is playing at Chateau Ste. Michelle winery this summer - would kill to see that - but can't handle the jail time !</p>

<div class="content"><p>'Tuber - I'm seeing them Saturday night.  Can't wait, should be a mind-blower.  Missed seeing them back in the 70's and never thought I'd get the chance.  Would love to hear your review.  I'd say have a nice time, but I think that's a slam dunk.</p>
<p>In other concert news, there were some earlier discussions in this thread regarding Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits, and we went and saw MK this past Sunday evening.  Great show.  I really enjoy his most recent album, Kill to Get Crimson.  The show was excellent and interesting.  The nature of his music and the tone he sets with his sort of mellow and mature stage presence lends to a nice listening experience.  There were actually times where he was basically challenging his band to see how *quiet* they could get and still carry the emotion of the song.  Pretty rare for a "rock" concert.  I have to say, though, that live does not measure up sonically with the gorgeous production he puts into his recordings.  Still, a great time.  BTW, nice write-up about him in the new Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Now, on to some serious Fusion with the R2F boys! </p>

<div class="content"><p>Hey OT</p>
<p>Cool on MK.  He's in Clearwater too, I got cheap and wouldn't fork over the $150 to see him.  Do you ever listen to Chris Rea?  Check out The Road To Hell.  In fact, I have a playlist that my wife and I listen to all the time that is random MK, Chris Rea and Fixx.  Those 3 fit like a glove to me.  If your not a CR fan, you will be if you like MK.  Chris plays a little more slide.</p>
<p>Lessee here.  They basically played two sets.  The first one was what I'd call electric.</p>
<p>Al D. I have always loved, at least since about 1978 or so for me.  He is just freaking incredible.  I think the only other guy that comes to mind in his league for me is John Petrucci.  Different styles tho.  The band's level of musicianship is just over the top.  Absolutely the best instrumental group I've ever seen live.  Not at all pretentious.  Fun and great.  Fourplay is up there too, they sing some which my wife liked.  These guys just play with razor honed chops from probably 4 of the most skilled, experienced, tasteful musicians on the planet.</p>
<p>Chick is all over the place, sounding like Wakeman, Keith Emerson, Bob James and on and on.  What a great composer and legend.  Not much else to say there.</p>
<p>That said, the sound quality was a bit of a disappointment.  Ruth Eckerd Hall is supposed to be great.  I was bitching instantly to my wife.  I would describe it as from about 1,000 to maybe 10,000 Hz it sounded gutted.  Like everything was on a compressor.  No ride on the symbols, Al was riffing but you couldn't hear it.  I think it was basically a mix problem, although the PA could have been weak.  I don't really know bout that.</p>
<p>After the second song the crowd was screaming "turn up Al".  I knew then I was spot on.  You couldn't really hear Al's leads at all.  Some guy walked onstage and turned up his amps.  It got better.  I kinda compare everything to the image in my mind of Jeff Beck live.  You could probably hear his pick hit the floor if he flipped it.  It looked like they only had one mike on all the cymbals, which might have contributed to my issues.  I hate to guess at the reasons, all I know was it should have sounded better.</p>
<p>For the second set Al was on acoustic and Stanley on upright.  Sound was much better as everything overall was softer.</p>
<p>Stanley and Chick talked a good bit which was fun.  Everyone did solos which were hot, several in general.  Stanley had everyone thumpin and goovin a few times.  What a fun guy to watch.  Note for note Stanley. Al and Chick played in unison and we aint talkin whole notes.  Stanley did a great solo on the upright that lasted .... I dunno ... 10 minutes?  The crowd loves every one of these guys and was overtly appreciative.  Al and Chick traded licks and then they'd both just grin.  Al really seemed to have to be having fun.  </p>
<p>I think Al is one of the fastest guys I've seen and he stays melodic.  That's a rarity.  When you see them, stare at his right hand when he's playing rhythm "chords".  He mutes a lot for an abrasive sound.  His hand, seriously, is just a total blur.  He's got total conservation of motion.  Robin Trower is like that.  I was transfixed.</p>
<p>Stanley had the Townsend windmill going, slapping, thumping, strumming, pounding, dragging, bow you name it.  He didn't ride his bass, but did about everything else.  He is the the 426 hemi of bass.  Now I like a lot of others too, but Stanley is just mo funner than anybody to watch and listen to live.  By fun I mean like Jim Creeggan in Bare N Ladies is fun to watch on upright.  Stanley plays while he plays.  Too much.</p>
<p>I'd never paid attention to Lenny White before.  That guy has a real soft touch and his rhythm is totally unique.  I was more than impressed.  You don't see this guy flailing and pounding, what a cool drummer.  Frankly, I'd say last night he changed my impression of what a good drummer should be.  So different than the rock drummers I've grown up admiring.  I always liked Carter Beauford in DMB a lot as a unique player and I guess Lenny is what these guys aspire to be.  Lenny's sticks/hands are seldom more than a couple inches above the drums.</p>
<p>You're gonna love seeing them.  It is a fun show by humble guys that are masters.  It's like they're going, wow, you remember us?  Thanks for coming.  Post how it goes.  Man, I'm tempted to pile wife in the car and drive to Orlando too!  Enjoy!</p>

<div class="content"><p>Great review, 'Tuber, thanks!  First, yes, my wife has actually been a Chris Rea fan from way back.  I never really listened to much, but I definitely will now.  </p>
<p>Regarding the R2F show, I have seen a couple of comments in reviews, blogs, etc that their sound has been a problem in some locations.  Too bad, you'd think these guys would demand better.  I will go in prepared to compromise a bit.  But yeah, I'll bet that even with that, it was still incredible.  So much talent on the stage.  Looking forward to those Chick and Al 64th notes in unison!  Yes, Al is amazing.  I was listening to something of his the other day and noted how fast and clean it was.  A lot of guitarists would cheat or hammer some of this fast stuff, but Al nails it.  Good to hear Stanley has fun also.</p>
<p>Can't wait!  We're driving to Atlanta from the Charlotte area tomorrow (Saturday) to see the show and driving back on Sunday.  Will report back with my impressions.  </p>

<div class="content"><p>'Tuber,</p>
<p>I really hate to bum you out, but the sound at our show last night was really quite good.  Better than I expected.  Loud, but very clean.  My wife and I have taken to wearing custom earplugs to most shows we go to these days, and we both did not wear ours last night.  I may regret it, but like I said it was clean and I didn't want to miss the whole sonic experience.  </p>
<p>What a night.  I know I'm going to sound like a total kool-aid drinking fanboy here, but seriously, this concert experience ranks in my top five of all time.  They were outstanding.  The crowd (Atlanta) was one of the most sophisticated I've seen and very into it.  And I really think the guys felt that and played enthusiastically and well.  As you said, they were really enjoying themselves and wanted the crowd to totally get in on the fun.</p>
<p>First set was electric based, intermission, second set acoustic based.  "Jester and Tyrant" as encore.  Each of them took the mic once in between songs for a little chat, usually funny.  Lenny White did this fairly serious diss of P. Diddy and rap in general - "They don't even play instruments.  These are instruments!  That's boy band music.  This is Man music!"  Ha!  They were all on fire.  Chick as the ringleader, playing different styles effortlessly.  Great to hear the Fender Rhodes and synthesizer work again.  Stanley's solo on the upright was a mind blower.  Massive standing O afterwards.  Al, OMG, Al.  He would do riffs with Chick perfectly and then during solo time he would occasionally pull off these 10 or 15 second bursts of speed that were just ridiculous.  Like I said, hate to say it, but his sound level was fine - he came through great.  Lenny was smooth and precise and sort of scary calm while busting out these completely stupid time signatures.   </p>
<p>These guys are insanely talented.  With the obvious exception of fine symphonic musicians, these guys put everyone else to shame.  Embarassingly so.  All night I was either laughing, shaking my head, or dropping my jaw.  I probably deserve a "Settle down Beavis!" here, but this one really did get to me.  Still sort of buzzing from it.</p>
<p>I really hope they are filming one of these shows for DVD so everyone can see this.  It was unreal.</p>

You probably saw the 4 guys in black slinking around the stage with video cameras.  I'd for sure pre-order that DVD.  If you don't see these guys you're missing out!</p>

<div class="content"><p>I bought a lot of music last year. The notables to me were: d/l's from NIN ( Ghosts, The Slip [free d/l's]) The Eagles Long Road Out of Eden, Walter Becker's Circus Money. CD's of note were: Alejando Escovedo's Real Animal, Bob Dylan's Modern Times, Corrine Bailey Rae's first album, James McMurtry's Just Us Kids, John Mellencamp's Life, Death Love and Freedom, R.Plant and  Alison Krause's Raising Sand, Mudcrutch's Mudcrutch, REM's Accelerate, Herbie Hancock's The River, Rob Fetter's Musician. I bought much more music online and in CD format that is older and venerable as well. The one performance that knocked me totally out and still is knocking me out is Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Dig!! Lazurus Dig!!!</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this problem?</p>

<div class="my-own 	 "><a href="/content/Im-Listening#comment-12445" class="active">Listening to: Il Giardino Armonico Anthology</a></div>


<div class="content"><p>Artist: Il Giardino Armonico<br />
Title: Il Giardino Armonico Anthology (11 CDs)<br />
Genre: Classical / Baroque<br />
Good song to sample: CD 4, Track 12: Vivaldi: Theme and 19 variations on "La Follia"</p>
<p>Similar artists: Hmmm....the closest in stylistic approach (i.e. "characterful") to performing Baroque music would probably be Jeah-Christophe Spinosi, but really they're nothing alike!  Emmanuell Haïm is also "spirited" and worth listening to IMHO.</p>
<p>Interesting notes: In a world full of historically informed Baroque peformers, Il Giardino Armonico have a certain...unique...sound, which comprises lots of energy and attack, usually coupled with close miking.  Much gritty string bowing - they must get through a lot of rosin!  This can get grating, but when it works, it works really, really well.  It works fantastically with lively Italianate music (like the works of Vivaldi and some Handel) but less well with stately Germanic music such as Bach.  In some very recent recordings I've heard from Il Giardino Armonico, they've got even more quirky to the point of obtuseness (I really don't want to hear the bass player humming his lines more loudly than he plays it!), but this anthology ranges over their recordings of the last 10 years or so.  If you like your Baroque music played by Klemperer and the Berlin Philharmonic, you'll probably loathe Il Giardino.  But if you're willing to listen to a performance with an open mind, purely for the sound experience, you'll porobably enjoy at least some of the recordings :)</p>
<p>Recording quality: The recordings of this set are generally good, and they're well mastered.  Close miking is a feature of the intimate soundscape that the band appear to be going for, so you get a lot of breathing along to the music recorded.  The earlier recordings are more "standard" Baroque interpretations/recordings (less closely miked).</p>
<p>Comments: I'm listenting to this FLAC through iTunes using Fluke, which installs all the necessary bits to play FLACs (and Oggs etc.) in iTunes, but will only import 16/44 so your hi-def tracks won't import.  It imports most of a FLAC's tagging, except the track numbers, which is irritating particualrly with Classical music where you *do* want to play the tracks in the right order!  I don't have an intel mac so I can't use Songbird.  I use Cog usually to play FLACs but its GUI is somewhat limited, so I'm experimenting with iTunes and Fluke.</p>
<p>Still trying to work out if the Apogee Duet is better, worse or just different from my Maranz CD75 :(</p>

<div class="content"><p>Hi Mark,<br />
long time, no hear! Yes I am up late, I sacrifice sleep to find time to catch up on the gossip!</p>
<p>I always seem to have too much other stuff to do and not enough time to trawl forums!<br />
Work is getting in the way of living!</p>
<p>I am still gradually digitising my vinyl using the Duet, but again, it is a time consuming job that I really don't get a good bite at.</p>

<div class="content"><p>... the 'gossip' (cough). I get the insomnia too. Work was getting in the way of living for the last year (10 years?) for me as well - I'm now looking for another job. Two months now. I'll find something... I'm living 'just enough' right now! Keep on digitizing! I just ordered Michael Powers Onyx Root from Waterloo Records (along with a Buddy Guy album as well) . The previews and whole songs I found on the web are awesome. I'm surprised that I hadn't heard of this guy before now.</p>
<p>Feel like I should put a "Listening to" up here. Let's see....... How about what I'm Listening to NOW?</p>
<p>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds<br />
Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!<br />
Rockin' Punkin' Blue<br />
Check out: Today's Lesson, We Call Upon the Author, Hold On To Yourself - this disc is great front to back actually<br />
Note: Shouldn't this band (or Grinderman) have won a Grammy by now?<br />
Quality is in the ear of the beholder. I think they've hit on a great sound on this one<br />
 Just LISTEN</p>
<p>Peter - take time to smell the roses man....<br />

<p>Strange, I'd say your experience was definitely rare as they have bent over backwards, TWICE, for me when a bad batch of pressings ended up on my table. Easily some of the best customer service I've encountered reminding me of the exceptional CS of Oppo. Actually have a box from their here right now, and their packaging is top notch.</p>
