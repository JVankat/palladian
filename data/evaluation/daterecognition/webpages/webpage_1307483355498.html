<P><STRONG>Reinventing Sharia</STRONG></P>
<P>O8 February 2008</P>
<P>By <A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/asim_siddiqui/2008/02/reinventing_sharia.html" target=_blank>Asim Siddiqui / The Guardian</A></P>
<P>The Archbishop of Canterbury is an immensely intelligent and thoughtful figure. His comments yesterday were his contribution to the difficult issues surrounding community cohesion and how to quell the feeling of alienation among some quarters of British Muslim communities so they feel more a part of this country. <BR><BR>While the tabloids have gone haywire it is important that we don't get carried away here. The difficulty with the term sharia is that it is such a broad notion which encapsulates both personal and public matters. It is also open to such varied interpretations. I would argue that the basic objectives of sharia (protection of life, family, dignity, intellect and property) are all covered by British law. The fundamental purpose of sharia is to achieve justice. This country is more just than most. So what more sharia do people want? <BR><BR>The aspects of sharia being considered by the archbishop are restricted to matters of family and finance law, ie civil matters. No one is suggesting introducing the so-called Islamic penal code - so let's not waste time debating something most of us don't want to see in the Muslim world, let alone Britain. <BR><BR>As for family and finance law: Let's deal with the latter first, the UK is already amending its finance laws to allow sharia-compliant products such as halal mortgages and Islamic bonds. Why? In part to attract the billions of petro-dollars floating in the cash-rich Gulf. That's a law driven by the commercial global realities to keep London as a premier financial capital; it's hardly the makings of Londonistan. As for family law, there can be no consideration for it to be incorporated into UK law unless there has been extensive consultation with human rights groups, women's groups, civil liberties groups and other stakeholders over what exactly it is they feel needs to be incorporated. There is currently zero consensus on this issue therefore its incorporation into statute is academic. There is also the important principle that we are all equal before one law. <BR><BR>It is perfectly fine for consenting Muslim adults to resolve their disputes according to Islamic law within the framework of UK civil law and provided that either party has recourse to it (as is currently the case). Wherever English law and "Islamic law" differ, "Islamic law" must give way. <BR><BR>The archbishop is right to suggest ways to integrate alienated Muslims into the mainstream. Part of that is to educate more religiously and/or culturally assertive Muslims on what sharia actually should mean in a modern context. This is the work for Muslim scholars to reinterpret practices considered by some to be "Islamic"; such as women witnesses being worth half that of men, men having up to four wives, custody of children transferring to the father, inheritance etc. In each case, there are multiple interpretations. It is for progressive Muslim scholars to ensure the more liberal and tolerant interpretations that are rooted in the Islamic tradition and part of Britain's libertarian heritage become dominant over time. That would do far more to aid Muslim integration than introducing a work in progress into statute.</P>

<P>February 9, 2008<BR><BR><STRONG>Living off the grid - how to escape the spies all around us</STRONG></P>
<P>At the wheel, at the till and at the computer keyboard we are all being watched. Here's a few ways to keep your life private<BR><BR>Nick Rosen<BR><BR>Britain is the undisputed leader in the free world at snooping on its citizens. We are watched everywhere we go: driving to work, walking the dog, shopping, taking the train.<BR><BR>We are constantly under surveillance, by camera, by the chips in our debit, credit or store cards. When we telephone or e-mail our friends, numerous agencies and private companies instantaneously know what we are doing and where we are doing it from. We can barely turn on a light or the oven without someone, somewhere, tracking our every move.<BR><BR>We believe that we cannot escape this casual surveillance of our lives so we casually accept it. But thousands of people are finding ways to avoid the day-to-day tracking by stepping wholly or partly outside the system and its control.<BR><BR>I spent a year travelling around Britain meeting people who live off-grid and learning how to avoid the invasive sweep of corporate data-hounds and sidestep the intrusive gaze of closed-circuit television cameras.<BR><BR>Four years ago there were an estimated 4.2 million CCTV cameras &nbsp;the exact figure is unknown as there is no central registration system &nbsp;but there are probably nearer 6 million cameras now.<BR><BR>There are up to ten on every bus and dozens at every station, so avoid London Transport if you want to evade the cameras. Most CCTV runs from speed cameras, which are less prevalent in the countryside. Maps of them are available on car websites.<BR><BR>Tinted car windows keep your face off camera but your numberplate will still give you away. Numberplate recognition computers are a classic example of function creep: cameras and computers installed for one purpose congestion charging &nbsp;are now used for another.<BR><BR>At night, use an infra-red light bulb to illuminate your numberplate. CCTV, like all video cameras, operates in that part of the spectrum near infra-red, so such a bulb above the number will flood the camera and is legal at the time of writing.<BR><BR>There is no legally enforceable code of practice on how these cameras should be used nor any widely accepted recording standards. Only one law governs CCTV cameras: for health and safety reasons they must be above head height &nbsp;at least 2.5m (8ft) from the ground.<BR><BR>Since we are literally watched from above, covering the head provides a level of anonymity and privacy, as everyone who wears a hoody knows.<BR><BR>Just as intrusive as surveillance cameras is the use and misuse of personal data. Sometimes the two forces, government and private, come together, as in that delightful question on the electoral registration form that asks you to tick here if you do not want your data sold for marketing purposes.<BR><BR>From NHS records to store cards, utility company records to social networking websites, our data is being sliced, diced and resold. So how can we take back control?<BR><BR>For a start, you can swap your store loyalty card with a friends (once you have spent all the points) so that you will get credits for your purchases but the retailer will not know whose data is being collected. You can do the same with Oyster or other travel cards &nbsp;the transport authorities will still have the aggregate data they need for management but they cannot track your individual movements.<BR><BR>You can switch from plastic to cash and barter and give or get free goods via Freecycle (<A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.freecycle.com/" target=_blank>www.freecycle.com</A>). There may be tax issues here &nbsp;it depends which accountant you ask.<BR><BR>Utility companies are huge holders of personal data but tens of thousands of people escape their clutches by living without mains services &nbsp;water, power, phone line or sewerage. By paying council tax they remain eligible to use the NHS and schools.<BR><BR>For town residents with an existing electricity supply, it does not yet make economic sense to cut off power. In the city the most common kinds of off-grid dwellings are boats, vans and tents in parents gardens. The last need planning permission but normally nobody bothers to seek it. Finding acceptable spots in cities to live full-time in a camper van is possible but not easy.<BR><BR>Thousands of people live on urban canals and rivers, paying the minimum &#163;75 a year to British Waterways for a continuous cruiser licence. They use no mains power nor need to pay council tax, and so evade the growing army of planning officers checking on the size of your patio extension.<BR><BR>Back on dry land, it is possible to dispense with your water supplier by having a borehole drilled in your garden, however small. You do not need a permit if it is not for industrial use. It will cost a few thousand pounds but for a large family on a water meter it makes economic sense, as well as limiting the amount of data accessible by the water company.<BR><BR>There are ways to ensure virtual invisibility online. The off-grid community uses encryption to ensure that its e-mails are not spied upon by governments or criminals. Hushmail (www. <A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://hushmail.com/" target=_blank>hushmail.com</A>), based in Canada, offers a free service that allows users to conceal the source of their e-mails and encrypts them.<BR><BR>These codes automatically bring users to the attention of electronic eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency of the United States, which assumes they have something to hide (which usually they do not) but it does protect them from casual surveillance.<BR><BR>You can browse the web in relative anonymity by using Xerobank (www. <A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://xerobank.com/" target=_blank>xerobank.com</A>), which passes your clicks through an anonymous data cloud, hiding the data normally revealed as you use a computer.<BR><BR>Facebook, which is owned by Microsoft, was recently criticised for teaming up with retailers to discover what its members were buying and then sending e-mails to those shoppers online friends, advising them of the purchases. This was done without the permission of the individuals involved and often without their knowledge.<BR><BR>There are ways of setting your privacy options within Facebook so that you would not be spied on and outed in this way but the settings are hard to find. The simplest way of dealing with the threat from social networking sites is to use an assumed identity when you join. It may be against their rules but the chances of being discovered are low and the worst that can happen is that your identity is closed down and you have to rejoin.<BR><BR>It is more of an effort to live off-grid, requiring a time-consuming vigilance as you monitor your communications and shopping habits to ensure that you are not giving away too much information. But I would rather spend my energy in positive action than in merely worrying, which is what most civil libertarians seem to do.<BR><BR>Nick Rosen is the author of How to Live Off-Grid.

The houses are made of local stone and straw bales and the community has its own sewage treatment plant and wind turbines<BR><BR>The Lost Tribe In 1993, the architectural historian Julian Orbach and his wife Emma set up a secret eco-village in Pembrokeshire National Park. The houses were made of wood and grass and generated their own power. The settlement remained undiscovered for five years until it was spotted by a plane.<BR><BR>Caroline Barry In 1995, Caroline Barry bought land near Butleigh, Somerset, where she reared livestock and grew her own food. She built a house out of straw bales but the council ruled she needed planning permission because it had a concrete base. Ms Barry pulled it down and built a straw house on a base of old tyres. It had no electricity or mod cons<BR><BR><A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3338076.ece" target=_blank>http://www.timesonline.co.uk<WBR>/tol/news/uk/article3338076<WBR>.ece</A></P>

<P><STRONG>'A new phase in the arms race is unfolding' says Putin</STRONG><BR><BR>By Shaun Walker in Moscow<BR><BR>Vladimir Putin has used one of the last major speeches of his presidency to deliver a defiant message to the West, accusing it of unleashing a new arms race that left Moscow no choice but to retaliate in kind. Less than a month before presidential elections that his hand-picked successor is almost certain to win, the speech removed any lingering doubts that Russian foreign policy might become less aggressive after Mr Putin steps down.<BR><BR>"It's clear that a new arms race is unfolding in the world," said Mr Putin, one that Russia did not start. And he vowed that Russia would respond to the threats by developing newer and more modern weapons that were as good as if not better than those possessed by Western countries. "We are being forced into retaliating ... Russia has and always will have the answers to these challenges," he said.<BR><BR>The speech in which he also condemned Nato expansion came as defence chiefs of the 26-nation alliance, increasingly alarmed by Russia's flexing of its military muscles, met in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, and urged Moscow to tone down its rhetoric.<BR><BR>Russian bomber patrols have recently been made over the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans and approached close to the borders of Nato airspace. Two Russian Tupolev-95 aircraft strayed south from their routine patrol pattern off the Norwegian coast and headed towards Scotland last September.<BR><BR>In the most recent incident, two long-range "Blackjack" bombers flew to the Bay of Biscay off France and Spain to test-launch missiles. The Russians have also hinted they want to re-establish a naval presence in the Mediterranean, probably using Syrian ports. The strategy is designed to heighten the visibility of Russia's military might but the sabre-rattling has alarmed Western countries and fuelled talk of a new Cold War.<BR><BR>Mr Putin went into overdrive yesterday, painting Russia as the victim of Western aggression and expansion, and promised a Russian response. He said Western countries spent far more on defence than Russia, and also returned to a theme he has raised many times before &nbsp;that of Nato enlargement towards Russian borders. "We pulled out of bases in Cuba and Vietnam," he said. "And what did we get? New American bases in Bulgaria and Romania."<BR><BR>He also complained about US plans to build elements of a missile defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic. "They try to persuade us that all these actions are not aimed against Russia," he said, "but they have no constructive answers to our well-founded concerns."<BR><BR>Russia has previously threatened to deploy nuclear missiles in its Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad if the US goes ahead with its plans. Russia's annual defence spending has quadrupled since Mr Putin came to power and the Kremlin has announced a &#163;100bn programme to modernise ageing military hardware.<BR><BR>Symbolically ominous changes are under way too: Russia recently announced that vast parades in Red Square to showcase the nation's military strength are to be revived this year for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mr Putin also accused unnamed foreign countries of cynically trying to gain unfair access to Russia's natural resources. "Many conflicts, foreign policy acts and diplomatic d�marches smell of oil and gas," he said. "This is the context in which we understand the growing interest towards Russia." He said the sovereignty of certain countries had been completely destroyed under slogans of freedom and democracy.<BR><BR>The speech was broadcast live on Russian television. Mr Putin was addressing the State Council, an influential gathering of the country's elite, including Dmitry Medvedev, the man virtually guaranteed to be Russia's next president. Also present was the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, Russia's richest man, attending in his capacity as governor of Russia's Chukotka region.<BR><BR>Mr Putin has consistently portrayed Western attempts to foster democracy in Russia as nefarious intentions. Last month, he told the security services to beware of foreign meddling in the upcoming presidential elections, and earlier this week the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe announced it would not monitor the election because of an unco-operative attitude from Russian officials.<BR><BR>Yesterday's bellicose remarks came at the end of a speech devoted to outlining achievements during his eight years in office and setting out a blueprint of Russia's development to 2020. He rattled off economic and social achievements over<BR><BR>the past eight years, boasting that Russians were now immeasurably better off than eight years ago, and laid out a development strategy to improve incomes, life expectancy, and quality of life for Russians by 2020.<BR><BR>Bizarrely, Mr Putin made no reference in his speech to the fact that the presidency will soon be changing hands, and spoke repeatedly of what "we" need to do.<BR><BR>Mr Medvedev, who is virtually certain to win the elections on 2 March, has asked Mr Putin to stay on as prime minister<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Bhutto killed by blast, not a bullet, Scotland Yard concludes</STRONG><BR><BR>Team backs official theory after month-long inquiry<BR>People's party rejects findings on leader's death<BR><BR>Declan Walsh in Lahore<BR><BR>Scotland Yard waded into the controversy around Benazir Bhutto's death yesterday when it released a report supporting the official explanation of how the opposition leader was killed. After a month-long investigation based largely on x-rays and video evidence, British investigators concluded that Bhutto was killed by a bomb blast and not, as is widely believed in Pakistan, by an assassin's bullet.<BR><BR>But their findings were rejected by Bhutto's party, the Pakistan People's party, which insists that Bhutto was felled by gunfire as she stood in her bulletproof jeep after a rally in Rawalpindi on December 27. "She died from a bullet injury. This was and is our position," said spokeswoman Sherry Rehman.<BR><BR>A lawyers' leader, Aitzaz Ahsan, said the report could only be "speculative" because the crime scene had been scrubbed clean by officials within hours of her death. The debate over the manner of Bhutto's death highlighted public suspicion of the government inquiry into the killing, which traumatised the country and caused elections to be postponed until February 18. Initial claims by the interior ministry that Bhutto died by hitting her head against a sunroof handle drew hoots of derision and stoked suspicions that the government was trying to exculpate itself.<BR><BR>President Pervez Musharraf named Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud as the man behind the plot. Bhutto supporters said the militant was a scapegoat to mask possible involvement by the state, in particular the intelligence agencies. Musharraf rejected such speculation and called in Scotland Yard investigators to reassure the public.<BR><BR>Yesterday the British team concluded that the evidence was sufficient to form an "overwhelming conclusion" that Bhutto was killed by a suicide blast that smashed her head against the escape hatch of her jeep as she ducked inside. They said nothing about who was behind the attack.<BR><BR>"The only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb blast," wrote Home Office pathologist Nathaniel Cary. Also, Bhutto was killed by a lone assassin, detectives concluded, and not by a team of killers, as many Pakistanis believe.<BR><BR>Critics said the British investigation lacked credibility due to its narrow terms of reference. Under the agreement between Musharraf and London the crucial question of determining the killers' identity has been left to Pakistani detectives.<BR></P>

Visitors' bags and other personal possessions were searched and copies taken of mobile phone contacts, personal documents and even keys. The allegations from a well-placed insider have led to calls for the former judge investigating the bugging scandal to extend his inquiry to probe all the alleged eavesdropping incidents at the prison.<BR><BR>Det Sgt Mark Kearney claims to have led a four-person team based at the prison that allegedly pioneered a new national programme to record covertly many of Britain's most notorious inmates, including dozens of terror suspects.<BR><BR>Secret microphones were alleged to have been hidden in specially adapted prison visiting tables in the divide between prisoner and visitor. The "bugging tables" were regularly moved between rooms and within the visiting areas in an attempt to prevent lawyers becoming suspicious. By 2007, there were understood to have been six tables in operation.<BR><BR>In legal documents seen by The Daily Telegraph, Mr Kearney claims his team had to work late at night to avoid alerting prison staff.<BR><BR>He said: "Keeping the covert recording devices (which are secreted into the visiting tables) working was always problematic. It involved working late quite often, so that we could covertly gain access to the tables, for&nbsp; maintenance."<BR><BR>Mr Kearney was appointed for his expertise in covert operations. In the late 1990s, he worked for the National Crime Squad as a liason for secret informants, said to have included one of Britain's top supergrasses. In 2002, he was given his new role responsible for "prison intelligence within Thames Valley" and implemented the secret policy of bugging prison visits. According to the well-placed insider, every time certain prisoners requested visiting orders, Mr Kearney's team would file an "intelligence report" on the background of the proposed visitor. "They were always told to tape them," the insider claimed.<BR><BR>Within Woodhill Prison, Mr Kearney's unit had a special "bugging suite". Three copies were made of each tape. One was sent to the relevant police investigation unit.<BR><BR>The other two are held at a secret location that cannot be revealed by The Daily Telegraph. It is alleged that because of the quality of the secret recording at Woodhill, prisoners were specifically moved there. This practice began to infuriate Mr Kearney as he was allegedy contacted by police forces around the country asking for his services.<BR><BR>Mr Kearney's legal statement claims: "It was requested that [Miles] Cooper [the letter bomber] be made a Category 'A' inmate, and go to Woodhill prison, so that we could bug all his telephone calls and social visits. I was reluctant, we were up to capacity at Woodhill prison with that type of work"<BR><BR>However, Mr Cooper, who was convicted last year, was made a Category A offender and moved to Woodhill within days of the request.<BR><BR>After the secret recording of Sadiq Khan MP during a visit to the prison, Jack Straw, the Justice Secretary, appointed Sir Christopher Rose to mount an inquiry. Mr Kearney has already offered to assist him and the Tories are expected to claim there has been a whitewash if the offer is not taken up.<BR><BR></P>

Listening devices were said to have been concealed in tables at the jail.<BR><BR>Nationally it is thought that many more people may have been covertly recorded.<BR><BR>Serious criminals, including the Soham murderer Ian Huntley and the letter bomber Miles Cooper, are also thought to have been targeted by the alleged secret bugging.<BR><BR>It is feared that the eavesdropping of legally-privileged discussions could lead to calls from defence solicitors for major criminal cases to be retried.<BR><BR>This weekend, ministers are under intense pressure to reveal what they knew about the secret bugging practice. David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said last night that he would be writing to Jack Straw, the Justice Secretary, demanding an inquiry into the surveillance process.<BR><BR>"It is inconceivable that this action has taken place without ministerial approval," he said.<BR><BR>"Whilst there can be reasons for eavesdropping on legal meetings, it is such a serious infringement of people's rights that there has to be a very good reason if this has happened. It can put the trial at risk which means that serious crimes may go unpunished."<BR><BR>Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said that he was "appalled" by the latest revelations.<BR><BR>"The confidentiality between a lawyer and client is a pillar of our legal system. I'm astonished that ministers have apparently given the go-ahead to this without any public discussion," he said.<BR><BR>Andrew Holroyd, the president of the Law Society, said: "It is completely unacceptable that defence solicitors should fear that their conversations with clients are being monitored.<BR><BR>"The law requires that conversations between a solicitor and their client are legally privileged. All monitoring should cease and if a conversation between a solicitor and a client is captured accidentally the tape should be destroyed."<BR><BR>The scandal came to light after Mr Khan, a Muslim Labour MP, was covertly recorded during two visits to a terrorist suspect held at Woodhill prison in Milton Keynes in 2005 and 2006.<BR><BR>It led to a political outcry as the bugging of MPs has been prohibited since the 1960s. Mr Straw was forced to set up an inquiry. He insisted he had known nothing of the operation before last weekend, although it later emerged that officials in his department had learnt of the allegations two months ago.<BR><BR>Now someone with detailed knowledge of the operation claims that Mr Khan's visits were allegedly among "hundreds of conversations" bugged by Det Sgt Mark Kearney during his time with a four-man intelligence team based at the prison since early 2002.<BR><BR>The recordings are deemed so sensitive that copies are stored at a secret facility protected by armed guards.<BR><BR>Initially, only a handful of prisons implemented the alleged bugging policy - including Woodhill and Belmarsh - but over the past 18 months the secret policy is alleged to have been rolled out across Britain.<BR><BR>At least 10 solicitors had conversations recorded at Woodhill while dozens more are thought to have been monitored across the country, the insider claimed. Hundreds of prison visitors were also targeted.<BR><BR>The whistleblower said: "Mark [Kearney] didn't feel what was going on was right or legal. Every person who came in and saw these terrorist suspects was the subject of an eavesdropping operation. He was put under huge amounts of pressure. Initially, it was just one or two machines but it steadily increased and now covers other category A prisoners such as murderers."<BR><BR>Documents seen by The Daily Telegraph reveal that Mr Kearney's team was also ordered to search and copy the contents of prison visitors' bags including keys and mobile phone sim cards.<BR><BR>These allegedly included confidential documents left by lawyers. It is also alleged that senior Woodhill prison staff were extremely unhappy with the practice.<BR><BR>A written statement drafted by Mr Kearney last year as part of his answer to criminal charges he now faces, claimed the pressure of what he was being asked to do affected his mental state.<BR><BR>After he became concerned about the work he was doing, detectives launched an investigation in February 2007 into whether he was leaking stories to the press via a local newspaper journalist, Sally Murrer.<BR><BR>He was charged with misconduct in a public office and, along with Mrs Murrer, faces prosecution next week. The pair claim their prosecution is a witch-hunt.<BR><BR>Last night, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: "Police monitoring operations are a matter for the police and are undertaken in line with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.<BR><BR>"The Prison Service may grant the police permission to operate in prison providing that there are no concerns about order or control. Such co-operation is vital in the fight against serious crime and terrorism.<BR><BR>"It would not usually be appropriate for the Prison Service to question the police's decision to monitor an individual; nor would it expect the police to share details of the intelligence cases underpinning its monitoring operations.<BR><BR>"It would not be appropriate to discuss particular prisoners or other individuals."<BR><BR></P><SPAN><SPAN>

<H1><SPAN><FONT size=2>'Terrorist' group who turned out to be the president's men</FONT></SPAN></H1>
<P style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Declan Walsh in Lahore<BR><STRONG><BR></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Diplomats have made a humiliating apology to six Pakistani men close to President Pervez Musharraf's ruling elite after they were wrongly arrested at Gatwick on suspicion of terrorist activity, interrogated and held for 21 hours. </SPAN></P>
<DIV>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The men - relatives or supporters of Chaudhry Shujat Hussain, a Musharraf lieutenant - flew into Gatwick on January 21 from Barcelona to be met by about 20 armed police and Scotland Yard detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Pakistanis were escorted to a Sussex police station where they were questioned, fingerprinted and photographed. At one point officers considered switching their suits for jail uniforms. </SPAN></P>
<DIV>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Eight hours later they were informed they were being arrested "on suspicion of operating or planning a terrorist activity", Haaris Elahi, an American citizen who is Hussain's nephew, said at the family mansion in Lahore.</SPAN></P></DIV>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">They were asked whether they supported the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, who they thought was responsible for the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, and - most bizarrely - whether they supported Musharraf and his Pakistan Muslim League (Q) party. "I said 'obviously - we are in it'," said Elahi.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">His interrogator was interested in his collection of Bollywood and Hollywood movies. "He asked if they contained any training guides, and if I knew how to use explosives," said 25-year-old Elahi. "I got all emotional and teary-eyed. So he said 'Maybe you're the innocent one, maybe it's not you. Maybe it's one of your friends.'"</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The men were transferred to Paddington police station, west London, in handcuffs, and soon after their lawyer arrived the police seemed to realise their mistake. The group were escorted to Heathrow and put on a flight to Pakistan with an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The arrests have infuriated Musharraf's inner circle. Sir Mark Lyall Grant, the director general political at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, met Hussain, a former prime minister, in London.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">"He explained that the police had acted on the basis of information that subsequently proved to be inaccurate," a statement said. "The British government deeply regrets the incident and is sorry for any personal distress that was caused to the individuals concerned."</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Hussain said that the FCO initially blamed the debacle on false information from the Spanish authorities but later shifted the blame to French intelligence. The government promised to erase the arrested men's fingerprint and DNA testing from police databases, he said. He noted that the arrests had come five days after 12 Pakistanis and two Indians were arrested in Barcelona on terrorism charges.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">News of the arrests were greeted with incredulity in Pakistan - not out of great public affection for Hussain's party, which is considered a figleaf for Musharraf's sham democracy and has been mired in allegations of cronyism and vote rigging, but because it suggested that no Pakistani is free of suspicion from Britain's anti-terrorism police, no matter what his background. Wajahat Hussain, a Musharraf stalwart who was in the party in advance of the president's recent tour of Paris and Brussels, said: "If this can happen to us then what about other Pakistanis? We are allies in the war on terrorism. They need to know who are their friends and who are their enemies."</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Pakistanis often complain of being racially profiled at western airports. Last month Abdul Sattar Edhi, a charity worker, had his passport confiscated for 24 hours in New York. Edhi said he felt he had been targeted for his long beard and traditional clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">"The problem is this scare of terrorism has lowered civil liberties all over the world," said IA Rehman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Chaudhry family had only received an apology thanks to their powerful connections, he added. "The fact is that many Pakistanis have been treated like that but the government has not lifted a finger. I hope this incident will make them aware of the problems Pakistani citizens face here and abroad."</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Haaris Elahi said he had a new-found appreciation of his fundamental rights. "I don't think this is the way to interrogate anyone innocent - and at least we had a hope that someone would get us out of there," he said. "What about the people who don't have anyone?"</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></SPAN></SPAN>

Roy McShane fled his family home yesterday after being taken into "protective &nbsp;custody". The disclosure is deeply embarrassing for Mr Adams as, only two years ago, it &nbsp;emerged one of his closest aides also worked for MI5. Denis Donaldson, who headed Sinn Fein's administrative team at Stormont, was found shot dead five months later. Shortly afterwards, intelligence sources spoke of their belief that there was &nbsp;another British agent close to Mr Adams. Mr McShane, a good friend of 56-year-old Donaldson, was a driver for senior republicans around the time of peace process talks which led to the Good Friday &nbsp;Agreement ten years ago. The bullet-proof Mercedes was used in secret missions taking Mr Adams and his &nbsp;deputy Martin McGuinness from Castle Buildings to persuade the IRA to decomission their weapons. The security services were also said to have bugged a Ford Mondeo that the two men used in 1999. Former republican associates claimed Mr McShane was merely a "working- class soldier", but he would have been privy to highly sensitive information as he ferried Adams and his colleagues to and from confidential talks. Scroll down for more...<BR><BR>Seat of power: Adams gets into his bullet-proof Mercedes Mr McShane, from the Clonard area of Belfast's Lower Falls, would have worked &nbsp;closely with bodyguards who protected Adams and McGuinness and would have been &nbsp;one of MI5's top informers, being well rewarded for his regular supply of information. He would have been on firstname terms with top Sinn Fein officials, including &nbsp;McGuinness, now deputy First Minister in the Northern Ireland assembly. Sinn Fein put a brave face on the revelation, insisting Mr McShane's double life was not a surprise. But there was shock in West Belfast, where he lived, drank and socialised with his golfing friends. Scroll down for more...<BR><BR>In hiding: Roy McShane, pictured at the front in green jacket with Martin McGuinness (far right) at a funeral in early 2001 A spokesman said: "The party leadership had concerns about this individual for some time. He was sidelined to the point of being removed from any work." And although Donaldson was murdered at a remote cottage months after being identified as a spy, the spokesman added that Mr McShane "is under no threat from republicans. If he wishes to return, it is up to him to make peace with his &nbsp;community and his family.<BR><BR>Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams: His party have been suspicious of Roy McShane for some time "The man has left his family, they have to pick up the pieces and that is a matter for him to address." Senior DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said: "We will want to establish why he has been taken into protective custody, if indeed that is the case, and whether or &nbsp;not there's some kind of threat from either the mainstream Provisional IRA or &nbsp;other republican elements." SDLP Assembly member Alex Attwood said the truth about collusion must be told. "What we need to know is how high and how deep in Sinn Fein and other parts of the Provisional movement the penetration by police, Army and security service agents went. "We need to know the full extent of collusion between republican and loyalist &nbsp;groups and the security forces, and we need to know the full price of such collusion in terms of human life." Mr Adams is due to meet party members in Dublin today to discuss the EU constitutional reform treaty. Police would not comment on the disclosure.<BR></P></SPAN></SPAN>

<P><B><SPAN>Panorama - Cocaine: Alex James in Colombia </SPAN></B><SPAN>&nbsp;BBC1</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Is the dumbing down of <I>Panorama</I> at last complete? So it seems. It's now a year since the programme was slashed to half an hour, returned from its graveyard slot on Sundays to prime time (Mondays, 8.30pm) and given a horrible tabloid sensibility that recently had it pitifully milking the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in a "special" that failed to turn up even one significant new piece of evidence. Perhaps by way of celebration, then, the producers sent Alex James, late of Blur, to Colombia to investigate the cocaine trade for the latest edition (28 January).</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>I wonder how <I>Panorama</I>'s real stars - serious, brave journalists such as Jane Corbin - felt about this. Pretty sick, I imagine, given that James's sole qualification for the task was that, when he was a pop star, he famously loved to powder his nose. What next? Dot Cotton from <I>EastEnders</I> takes on the tobacco giants? Or here's an idea: get the guy who plays Charlie in <I>Casualty </I>to make a film about MRSA - that'll get those bloody nurses washing their hands. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>I do try to be grown-up when I write reviews, but since it would be a total fabrication to call this programme grown-up - or even, come to that, adolescent - I might as well admit that when I looked back at the notes I'd made while watching it, I found I'd scored the phrase "what an arse" in the margin no fewer than three times.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>The film began with our "reporter" introducing himself. "I'm Alex James, and I'm a farmer," he said. No, you're not, Alex. You're a rock star who bought himself a farm, which is an entirely different state of affairs. With a flick of his poncey fringe, James held up a letter he'd received from the president of Colombia inviting him to see at first hand the miserable effects of the cocaine wars: landmines, kidnappings, human displacement, general destruction of the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>Journalists get killed covering this stuff: some 50 of them in the past 15 years, in fact. But was our cute little bass player trepidatious? Apparently not. He could hardly wait. Here, after all, was yet another chance for him to press his home-made cheese on an unsuspecting foreign dignitary.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>So, off he went. Once out there, he undoubtedly had amazing access, from the Black Hawk team with whom he went out spraying coca crops in the rainforest to the drug cartel's full-time contract killer in whose "taxi" he took a spin. But did his insights into these experiences have to be so glib? Even when trying to convey fear, he couldn't resist gilding his statements with something more smug. "I'm out of my depth," he said, hopping into Mr Killer's cab. And then: "This is a long, long way from a cheeky line at a dinner party in Notting Hill."</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>This carry-on reached its nadir when he finally got to meet President �lvaro Uribe. First, we were treated to the ridiculous spectacle of James handing over a box of his farm-fresh fromage. The president sniffed it, politely. Uribe, a patrician right-winger and US ally, is determined to stamp on the drug cartels - they fund the Farc, the revolutionary guerrillas who murdered his father - and several attempts have been made on his life as a consequence.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>James asked him a couple of vague questions, and was told that every line of cocaine snorted in Britain is simply more "gasoline for assassinations". Fine. Once the meeting was over, however, James began acting like some doe-eyed groupie. "I support him!" he said joyously, punching the air. Good grief. If Michael Crick were suddenly to have announced on <I>Newsnight</I> that he really fancies Yvette Cooper, and cannot therefore be expected to unpick her latest legislative proposals, I don't think I could have been any more appalled. Some will argue what we might call the Channel 4 battery chicken defence for this film - namely that celebrity can, and should, be used to right moral wrongs. Maybe so. But the key words here are "documentary" and "<I>Panorama</I>". A once-mighty current affairs programme is reduced to screening the ill- informed, partisan burblings of a pop-star cheese-maker with a daft fringe and, by his own account, "gringo Bond Street boots". Please, someone, make it stop.</SPAN></P>

Mr Karzai has become increasingly critical of Nato operations in the country, and it is hoped the visit will stop the rot in relations.<BR><BR>However, Mr Miliband and Miss Rice stressed today that the responsibility of restoring order to the troubled country lies with both sides.<BR><BR>Mr Miliband said: "We've got responsibilities that we're determined to live up to and obligations that we're determined to live up to and ditto for the Afghan authorities.<BR><BR>"That's something we want to follow through and at the heart of both our strategies is the belief this has to be done with the Afghan government and in fact led by the Afghan government, with our support."<BR><BR>Miss Rice added: "The Afghan government has responsibilities, too. This is a two-way street, and I think everybody has to step back and concern ourselves with the Taliban."<BR><BR>Before flying to Afghanistan Miss Rice had been in London for talks with Mr Miliband and Gordon Brown, where they issued a renewed appeal to Nato allies to take on a greater share of the fighting against the Taliban.<BR><BR>Robert Gates, the US Defence Secretary, has said he will continue to be "a nag on this issue" at the Nato meeting today and tomorrow in Vilnius, Lithuania.<BR><BR>Yesterday Miss Rice acknowledged that the Nato alliance was facing a "real test" in Afghanistan.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Freedom Of Information: Facebook &nbsp;the new battleground in Iraq and Afghanistan</STRONG><BR><BR>Social networking sites present a PR problem for the Army. Robert Verkaik, Law Editor, examines newly released papers showing how the generals intend to tackle the new media<BR><BR><BR>Facebook and MySpace are at the centre of a new media offensive in the Government's battle to win the PR campaign over unpopular conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.<BR><BR>Documents released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) under the Freedom of Information Act show that ministers are concerned that overwhelming public opinion is opposed to "operations in Iraq" and that there is only a slim majority in favour of Britain's military role in Afghanistan.<BR><BR>A series of negative stories concerning poor equipment, accommodation and pay has been fuelled by soldiers using social networking sites and video-sharing sites, such as YouTube, to publicise their own grievances. The MoD warns that "more discipline" and "greater enforcement" of military conduct rules is necessary to tackle "the publishing of unauthorised content on unofficial channels . . ."<BR><BR>One strategy paper published in August last year acknowledges that "internal communications has tended to take second place to our engagement with the media. Yet our own people are our most effective advocates in promoting our activities, and they can be our most damaging critics."<BR><BR>For military personnel who continue to breach the rules and use the internet to publish unauthorised video footage or complain about their lot, it could mean a court martial and dismissal from the Armed Forces.<BR><BR>On the wider PR campaign, the MoD adds: "There is a lack of public understanding of the rationale behind each mission . . . There is a growing perception that &nbsp;particularly on operations &nbsp;our Armed Forces are not as well equipped as they should be and that we do not look after our people as well as we should." To counter these perceptions the MoD spin doctors suggest accentuating the positive rather than allowing the media to dwell on the negative. In Iraq, for example, commanders are told to "focus on the transition to Provincial Iraqi Control whilst continuing to maintain 'Overwatch'."<BR><BR>But in Afghanistan, it is better to highlight the reconstruction and development in Helmand Province and other parts of Afghanistan. "That has only been possible because of the military's efforts in maintaining the security situation," says the paper.<BR><BR>Commanders are also told to use the former conflict in Bosnia to illustrate "the success of the mission to demonstrate that things can be brought to a successful conclusion". In a separate document entitled "Defence On-line Engagement Strategy" sets out plans to use the new media for their own PR purposes. The MoD, in these documents, describes the "social media" as a Brave New World, but warns that it presents "new and emerging threats".<BR><BR>"We will not get our message across through 'traditional' media alone(especially increasingly politicised national press)," one of the papers says: <BR>We need to exploit the many emerging channels and take advantage of their being increasingly trusted. We also need to get our messages direct to the public without going through potentially distorting media. It will be impossible to control the tide of new technology and channels or the way information is exchanged outside "traditional" channels.<BR><BR><A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:r.verkaik@independent.co.uk">r.verkaik@independent.co.uk</A><BR></P></SPAN></SPAN>

They include not only the police and security and intelligence agencies, but 474 local authorities and 110 other public bodies. Gordon Brown did not help matters in the Commons yesterday. Downing Street spin had led us to believe privy councillors would propose ending the ban on the use of telephone-tap evidence in criminal trials, but Brown made it clear that we are back to square one. Such evidence may be used, but only if those who carried out the tapping - MI5 or GCHQ, for instance - agreed, he said.<BR><BR>Intelligence obtained by phone taps cannot be used in court; intelligence obtained through bugs or video surveillance can. The anomaly goes further, as the justice secretary, Jack Straw, admitted this week. MPs raised the Wilson doctrine - which protects MPs and peers from eavesdropping - after the disclosure that a conversation between the Labour MP Sadiq Khan and his constituent Babar Ahmad had been bugged in Woodhill prison. Straw pointed out that the doctrine applied only to phone taps, not bugging. This distinction seems nonsensical, but it is important: for the law says a cabinet minister has to authorise phone taps while a senior police officer can authorise bugging. Thus ministers, Straw told MPs, were not involved in the Woodhill incident. All kinds of covert surveillance are covered by the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). Yet they are treated differently, in the way those carrying out the surveillance are held to account. There are three commissioners responsible for monitoring the activities of those with authority to find out, through covert means, what we are up to. They publish annual reports - which are censored.<BR><BR>The interception-of-communications commissioner, now Sir Paul Kennedy, deals with phone taps, opening post and reading email content - all requiring a minister's warrant. Interceptions authorised by the home secretary are published (there were 754 warrants in place on December 31 2006, though that figure is misleading since a warrant may cover many lines), but those authorised by the foreign and Northern Ireland secretaries are not disclosed.<BR><BR>Kennedy is also responsible for monitoring the way public authorities, including local councils, have access to "communications data". This has led to misleading, though understandable, claims. Kennedy revealed last week that 253,557 requests were made for such data over the last nine months of 2006. But such data, under Ripa, means only phone numbers and email addresses, not their content. Requests can be approved by any senior official.<BR><BR>Unlike phone taps, bugging can be authorised by senior law enforcement officials. They are supposed to notify a surveillance commissioner, who has the power to quash such authorisations. The chief surveillance commissioner is Sir Christopher Rose, asked this week by Straw to find out why Khan was bugged. The police and Revenue and Customs approved some 350 bugging operations last year, according to official figures.<BR><BR>Then there is the intelligence services commissioner, Sir Peter Gibson. He is responsible for monitoring secret bugging operations by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. Last week he declined to reveal the number of bugs these agencies had planted, on the grounds that to do so would "assist those hostile to the UK".<BR><BR>Year after year, these commissioners praise the diligence of those who bug and intercept in the name of national security. But their credibility, always shaky, was dealt a huge blow this week.<BR><BR>Richard Norton-Taylor is the Guardian's security affairs editor<BR><A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="mailto:richard.norton-taylor@guardian.co.uk">richard.norton-taylor@guardian<WBR>.co.uk</A><BR></P></SPAN></SPAN>

<P><SPAN><SPAN lang=EN style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN lang=EN style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt">By MATTHEW L. WALD<BR>Published: February 7, 2008<BR><BR>WASHINGTON &nbsp;The Energy Department is subsidizing two Russian nuclear institutes that are building important parts of a reactor in Iran whose construction the United States spent years trying to stop, according to a House committee.<BR><BR>The institutes, both in Nizhny Novgorod, gave American officials copies of sales presentations that listed the Bushehr reactor, which Russia has agreed to fuel, as one of their projects. One institute is providing control systems, including control room equipment, and the other, hundreds of pumps and ventilation fans.<BR><BR>The Energy Department is subsidizing the institutes under the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention, a program set up in 1994, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The program was intended to prevent newly impoverished scientists and their institutions from selling expertise to states or terrorist groups that want nuclear weapons.<BR><BR>The United States supplements the salaries of scientists and pays overhead at those institutes, according to the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee.<BR><BR>It was not immediately clear whether the Energy Department was contributing to the salaries of the very scientists involved in the Bushehr reactor project. Two Michigan Democrats &nbsp;Representatives John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Bart Stupak, chairman of that committees Oversight and Investigations subcommittee &nbsp;asked that question in a letter sent on Wednesday to Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman.<BR><BR>What policy logic justifies D.O.E. funding Russian institutes which are providing nuclear technology to Iran? the letter asked. How does this advance our non-proliferation goals?<BR><BR>Mr. Bodman is supposed to testify on Thursday before the Energy and Commerce Committee in a hastily scheduled hearing to explore the issue. Mr. Dingell, in a telephone interview, pointed out that the State Department has accused Iran of using the Bushehr reactor as a cover for obtaining nuclear technology useful in a weapons program. And, he said, Weve got a bunch of federal laws that impose sanctions on U.S. companies that develop Irans oil.<BR><BR>But under the nonproliferation program, he said, Weve got U.S. money providing assistance to help develop a reactor that were busy denouncing.<BR><BR>Mr. Dingell said the committee would also pursue whether the Energy Department was subsidizing any institutes that worked with North Korea, Syria or other countries that are developing nuclear weapons or may be seeking to do so.<BR><BR>But the Energy Department said in a statement Wednesday evening, We are confident that none of the projects cited by the House committee, or any of the departments scientist engagement projects with Russia, support nuclear work in Iran.<BR><BR>The statement added, We take all measures necessary to ensure that neither money nor technology falls into the hands of countries of concern.<BR><BR>Individual projects are cleared by the Defense Department, the State Department and intelligence agencies, according to the Energy Department.<BR><BR>An Energy Department official said, What were doing is very important to engage these scientists as part of a nonproliferation goal. The official requested anonymity because his response had not gone through official channels.<BR><BR>The Energy Department has approved projects with the two institutes worth $4 million, according to the letter sent by the committee chairmen to Mr. Bodman on Wednesday, but the Energy Department official said that sum included a $1 million project that might have been canceled.<BR><BR>Because of the design of Bushehr, a civilian electric power plant, it would be cumbersome to recover the plutonium that is the byproduct of its operations. In addition, Russia has announced that it will take back the spent fuel from the plant, thus making the plutonium unavailable to Iran.<BR><BR>But the United States has looked with some alarm at Iran acquiring nuclear expertise. Iran wants to build a plant to enrich uranium and make its own reactor fuel, saying it wants to do so for civilian purposes. American officials complain that the enrichment technology could also be used to make warheads.<BR><BR>Mr. Dingell said, Only this administration would complain about proliferation in Iran, as part of President Bushs axis of evil, and then finance it with American taxpayer dollars.<BR><BR>Mr. Stupak called it schizophrenic foreign policy.<BR><BR>We should not be doing business with institutes that help promote Irans nuclear ambitions, he said.<BR><BR>The United States pays for a variety of projects at numerous institutes in Russia and other former Soviet countries. For example, at the Scientific Research Institute of Measuring Systems in Nizhny Novgorod, which is making control room equipment for Bushehr, the United States is paying $1.15 million for a project for radar mapping of geological structures, which could be used to locate underground mineral deposits.<BR><BR>A study of the American program by the Government Accountability Office released last month found that while the program was intended to provide support for former Soviet weapons scientists, many of those receiving benefits had done no weapons work, and some were not old enough to have worked as scientists during Soviet times.<BR><BR>An Energy Department official testifying before Mr. Stupak acknowledged at a hearing on Jan. 23 that parts of the program may have outlived the original intent.<BR><BR>The Bushehr reactor has had a long, involved history. In 1975 the shah of Iran ordered twin reactors from a German firm, Kraftwerke-Union, but work stopped after he was overthrown in 1979. The two units were bombed by the Iraqis in the Iran-Iraq war that began in 1980.<BR><BR>In 1995, the Iranian government contracted with Russia to finish the first unit, a major challenge because the standard Russian design was substantially different from the German design.<BR><BR>The reactor is supposed to begin producing power this year, Iranian officials said.<BR></P></SPAN></SPAN>

Why were they scratching around when the decision had been made a long time ago that Babar Ahmad was not going to be prosecuted in Britain? asked Gareth Peirce, Mr Ahmads solicitor. Were they trying to exploit some perceived vulnerability in the bugged conversation?<BR><BR>Ms Peirce said she has written to Jack Straw, the Justice Secretary, and Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, raising issues she wants the inquiry into the bugging to look at. She said: Very serious questions have to be asked about who this eavesdropping was being carried out for.<BR><BR>Mark Kearney, a former police intelligence officer at the prison in Milton Keynes, has claimed he was put under pressure by the Met to carry out the bugging. Mr Kearney, 48, is being prosecuted for allegedly leaking unrelated information to a local newspaper journalist. The former officer wants to give evidence to the inquiry into the bugging incident but has yet to hear from Sir Christopher Rose, the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, who is conducting it.<BR></P></SPAN></SPAN>

A jury at Leicester Crown Court was told that Khan then called his daughter towards him and asked her: What will you cook for the men in the mountains?<BR><BR>Khan, 37, has admitted planning to murder a British Muslim soldier who was to be lured to a car in Birmingham city centre, then driven to a lockup garage. Video footage would have been released of him being beheaded like a pig. Khan, who is married with three children, has also pleaded guilty to sending equipment to Pakistan for terrorists fighting British and American troops in Afghanistan.<BR><BR>Mr Iqbal, 30, an attendance and monitoring officer at a Birmingham school, denies aiding Khan in supplying equipment for terrorism. He has also pleaded not guilty to possessing a jihadist computer disc.<BR><BR>Transcripts of conversations between Khan and Mr Iqbal that were secretly recorded at Khans home, in the Alum Rock area of Birmingham, were read to the court yesterday.<BR><BR>Nigel Rumfitt, QC, for the prosecution, said they showed that Khan wants his daughter to marry a Mujahidin terrorist . . . that is what he was training her to want. That is about as sick as it gets ? a three-year-old girl being asked what she wants to cook for a Mujahidin in the mountains.<BR><BR>The court has been told that Khan sent four large shipments of items to Pakistan over two years, including night-vision apparatus, snipers gloves and equipment to detect cameras and electronic bugs.<BR><BR>Mr Iqbal has told the jury that he thought his trips with Khan to wholesalers in the Birmingham area were to buy relief aid for victims of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.<BR><BR>All I saw were fleeces and thermals. I never saw any radar detectors or night-vision equipment, he said. Questioned about the bugged conversations he had with Khan, he said he thought that his friend was not being serious when he talked about terrorism. I just understood him to be waffling on, fantasising, that sort of thing, he said.<BR><BR>Khan had not been talking about his daughter marrying a Mujahid, said Mr Iqbal, who claimed that his friend had meant that he wanted her to marry an Afghan mountain villager.<BR><BR>The court has heard that a computer disc called Encyclopaedia Jihad was found by police in a bag at Mr Iqbals house in Birmingham after raids in January last year. Mr Iqbal says that he did not know what was inside the bag, which belonged to Khan.<BR><BR>Alongside Mr Iqbal in the dock is Amjad Mahmood, 32, a shopkeeper, who denies supplying equipment for terrorism and failing to disclose information about the kidnap plot. Three Birmingham men have admitted offences linked to Khans activities, including Basiru Gassama, 30, a Gambian who pleaded guilty to failing to disclose information about the kidnap plot. Hamid Elasmar, 44, and Mohammed Irfan, 31, have admitted supplying equipment for terrorism.<BR><BR>Mr Iqbals wife, Rohama Sattar, told the court about her at times impossible marriage, adding that her husband was torn between his love for his mother and his wife. Jurors also heard that Mrs Sattar wrote a letter to her husband in 2000 in which she referred to his jihad obligation. She told the court that she thought of this in terms of a personal struggle.<BR><BR>Former colleagues of Mr Iqbal, who worked as an achievement mentor at Saltley School, described him as a moderate Muslim who was popular with pupils and staff. Anne Cole, the head teacher, said she was shocked at his arrest. Ann Burton, the assistant head, added: I found him to be a caring, kind person who worked hard for the children.<BR><BR>The trial continues.<BR><BR></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN lang=EN style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"></SPAN></SPAN></P>

He told MPs in a statement that this would involve a substantial programme of work covering legal, operational and technical issues. An implementation team within Whitehall will work alongside members of the Chilcot committee to try to find a way round these problems.<BR><BR>David Cameron, the Tory leader, said the implementation body must not be a talking shop for further delay. He said: At the end of the day, this is a political decision and that has got to be made by a politician. That means him [Mr Brown]. It is clear what needs to be done: intercept in court so we catch, convict and imprison more terrorists. We must not put off endlessly what needs to be done.<BR><BR>The report from Sir John recommends nine conditions to be met before any change is made, which could limit the practical effect of lifting the current ban on intercept material being used as evidence in courts.<BR><BR>The crucial condition states: The intercepting agency shall decide whether a prosecution involving their intercepted material shall proceed.<BR><BR>Among other conditions is that no intelligence or law enforcement agency should be required to transcribe or make notes of intercepted material to a substantially higher standard than it believes to meet its objectives. This means that they would not have to produce material to the standard required for it to be used as evidence.<BR><BR>Another condition is that in trials, defence lawyers should be banned from fishing expeditions against intercept evidence held by any agency.<BR><BR>The report discloses that officers operating the present system have substantial fears that a change in the law could damage national security.<BR><BR>The Association of Chief Police Officers is opposed to allowing intercept evidence because of its potential effect on counter-terrorism and cases such as kidnappings. The Metropolitan Police and police in Scotland and Northern Ireland have a similar view.<BR><BR>Officers in the Metropolitan Police conducted a review of cases in 2006-07 which involved interception and concluded that a change in the law would have increased the conviction rate from 88 per cent to 92 per cent, the report said.<BR><BR>It said that the Crown Prosecution Service believed there would be more guilty pleas under a regime that allowed defendants own words to be played to a jury, because criminals would realise that their case is hopeless. More criminals might also turn supergrass as a result, it said.<BR><BR>Campaigners have said using phone-tap evidence would reduce the need to impose control orders on suspects by enabling them to be tried instead. But a review of nine control order cases found that in four cases the intercepted material would not have been of evidential value, and in the other five, using the evidence in open court would have damaged national security.<BR><BR>The report disclosed that the Home Office is leading a new programme to update Britains ability to intercept phone calls and electronic communications, triggered by the proliferation of internet-based communications.<BR></P></SPAN></SPAN>

<P><STRONG>Problems on all fronts as Afghan mission reaches turning point<BR></STRONG><BR>Declan Walsh in Lahore and Ian Traynor in Brussels<BR><BR>Nato tensions Nato's Afghanistan campaign is the alliance's biggest test. On that there is a consensus among both Nato's cheerleaders and critics. Whether it is passing or failing that test is the key question, with the mission possibly at a turning point. The past fortnight, leading up to a Nato defence ministers' meeting in Lithuania tomorrow and then a summit in Romania in April, has witnessed a transatlantic shouting match between the Pentagon and Europe over mismatched abilities, alleged cowardice and incompetence from Kunduz to Helmand.<BR><BR>The Dutch called in the US ambassador for a dressing down after Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, said the Europeans were no good at counter-insurgency. Gates climbed down, partly, but then fired off a letter to Berlin demanding the Germans put their lives on the line in combat in the south rather than enjoying the relatively cushy conditions of the north. A furious German response followed. Canada, meanwhile, warned it may pull out unless other countries stepped up to the plate. "Events in Afghanistan have become a motor for the transformation of the alliance," said a senior Nato diplomat.<BR><BR>Victoria Nuland, the US ambassador to the alliance, echoed that view, and the Pentagon is sending a further 3,200 US marines to Afghanistan. "We will again challenge our allies to match us soldier for soldier, euro for dollar," Nuland said.<BR><BR>"The Anglo-American strategy in Afghanistan has hit an absolute low mark," said Daniel Korski of the European Council on Foreign Relations. "If European countries are unwilling to send more troops, trainers and civilians to the Afghan mission, then the US needs to do so itself. To halt a spring offensive by the Taliban, more than 10,000 extra troops would be needed. It's now a question of surge or succumb."<BR><BR>Deployment issues<BR>The Nato operation is hampered by special pleading by countries taking part, and the lack of aircraft. "National caveats" such as that deployed by Germany to confine its troops to the north are exasperating countries with troops on the frontline. "National caveats are a bad thing," said the Nato diplomat. Similar problems bedevilled Nato's in the early stages of its first ever war, in Kosovo in 1999.<BR><BR>"When you have an alliance of 2 million men and you see how difficult it is to maintain 35,000 [in Afghanistan] and to get five helicopters and you see the outlook for Afghanistan, something has to happen," said General Henk van den Bremen, a retired Dutch chief of staff.<BR><BR>Testy relations<BR>The Afghan winter has nothing on the chill between President Hamid Karzai and his western allies these days. Corruption, drugs and a galloping insurgency have strained relations, particularly with Britain. Karzai recently vetoed Paddy Ashdown as the "superenvoy" of the United Nations Mission; a British UN official was expelled in late December; and Afghan intelligence officials have been briefing journalists about an alleged British plan to establish Taliban "retirement camps" in Helmand. "You don't do this to friendly countries," one analyst noted.<BR><BR>Some argue the imbroglio is not as nasty as it appears and may be part electioneering. Karzai needs to shrug off his image as a western puppet before elections due next year. But Karzai's greatest problem lies within his own government. Many departments are hopelessly ineffectual and drug-greased corruption is endemic.<BR><BR>Taliban<BR>Taliban fighters don't take alcohol - at least not officially - but 2007 was a champagne year. It "will likely be looked back upon as the year in which the Taliban seriously rejoined the fight and hopes of a rapid end to conflict were finally set aside," reported Anso, a Kabul-based security advisory agency. The militants are certainly punching above their weight. The UN estimates the Taliban have just 3,000 active fighters and about 7,000 part-timers, in contrast with more than 50,000 US and Nato troops. Their command structure is diffuse and fighters are motivated by much more than religion. When they fight Nato forces directly they lose badly.<BR><BR>But when it comes to the guerrilla tactics - suicide attacks, roadside bombs, kidnapping and assassination - the militants have become frighteningly proficient. Suicide bombings soared from just five between 2001 and 2005 to 140 in 2007. Provinces close to Kabul have been destabilised and some aid programmes have closed. Some western officials argue the situation is not as dire as it looks, and Nato sees the suicide attacks as a sign of desperation. But some security analysts see it differently. The blasts are the sign of successful guerrilla force, they say. The Taliban are also proving responsive to public opinion. This week the leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, called for an end to beheadings of suspected spies, gory decapitation videos having become a PR embarrassment to the rebels.<BR><BR>Drugs<BR>At a donors' conference in Tokyo today the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa, will present his estimates of this year's Afghan poppy crop. Good news is not expected.<BR><BR>Early indications are that last year's record harvest, concentrated in British-occupied Helmand, will be equalled in 2008. The opium poppies have become central to Afghanistan's misery. Drugs corrupt government, foster violence and provide invaluable funding to the Taliban. Western officials point to some successes, such as the rise in drug-free provinces from six to 13 last year. But poppy cultivation has simply shifted into lawless southern and western provinces.<BR><BR>Western and Afghan officials agree on the basket of measures needed to beat the scourge - eradication, farming alternatives, arrest of the drug lords - but squabble about which should come first. The US ambassador William Wood favours deploying a squadron of pesticide-laden crop-duster planes over the poppy fields, a technique used against coca plantations during his posting in Colombia.<BR><BR>But Afghan and British officials are trenchantly against the idea, arguing it will drive farmers into the insurgents' arms, and it has been shelved. As dollar-a-day farmers come under scrutiny, the million-buck kingpins go free.<BR><BR>While 3.3 million Afghans are involved in opium cultivation, the authorities made just 760 arrests last year. The problem is linked to the weak judicial system. Only one major figure has been arrested since 2001, during a trip to New York.<BR></P>

John Chipman, the head of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which published the survey, said the "next target of Moscows assertive revisionism" could be the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty of 1987.<BR><BR>This crucial agreement, signed by President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, eliminated medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.<BR><BR>President Vladimir Putin has already stopped adhering to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE), which came into force in 1992 and restricts the deployment of troops and tanks near sensitive European frontiers.<BR><BR>Later this year, Russia is expected to formally withdraw from the CFE treaty.<BR><BR>Taken together, these steps would allow Russia to build a new generation of medium-range nuclear missiles capable of striking Western Europe.<BR><BR>Its armed forces would also be free to deploy near any European country bordering Russia.<BR><BR>"The end of the CFE treaty, the cornerstone of post-Cold War European security, could have negative consequences for Europe," said Mr Chipman.<BR><BR>"It will abolish an important confidence-building mechanism &nbsp;including the exchange of data and an inspection regime &nbsp;and introduce new tensions between Russia and its neighbours, particularly if Russia decides to redeploy its troops closer to Nato member states."<BR><BR>In 2002, America withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bars the deployment of defensive missiles.<BR><BR>Taking this alongside Russia's possible breach of the INF Treaty, Mr Chipman said: "The unravelling of the infrastructure of European arms control can be seen as well in train."<BR><BR>"For this not to matter, the burden will be all the higher on diplomats and politicians to avoid an escalation of tensions that would make military dispositions in Europe again a cause of strategic concern."<BR><BR>Russia's total military spending is exceptionally difficult to calculate. Several ministries have defence-related budgets.<BR><BR>Taking all this into account, The Military Balance estimates Russia's total expenditure is &#163;35 billion, compared with Britains &#163;34 billion this year. Yet last November, Des Browne, the defence secretary, claimed Britain had the "second highest defence budget in the world in real terms", with only America spending more.<BR><BR>The gap between British and Russian military expenditure is set to widen. Russia's defence budget is forecast to rise by 23 per cent by 2010. Meanwhile, Britain's is increasing by 1�4 per cent after inflation. Elsewhere, the global military balance is shifting decisively away from Western Europe and towards Asia. China raised its military spending by 33 per cent in a single year, 2006-7. Indias defence budget rose by 24 per cent in the same period.<BR><BR>Both countries are acquiring the ability to project power across the world.<BR><BR>While Western Europe is steadily being overhauled, America's global military dominance is still assured. The Pentagon spent &#163;310 billion last year, almost 10 times more than the Kremlin's defence budget. </P>

<P>Wednesday February 6, 2008<BR><BR><STRONG>Extra firepower sent to Afghanistan as UK digs in</STRONG><BR><BR>. Record deployment of paratroopers<BR>. Country may be sliding to civil war<BR><BR>Richard Norton-Taylor and Ian Traynor in Brussels<BR><BR>A fresh British force with extra firepower is to be sent to Afghanistan as the US intensifies pressure on other European allies in an increasingly urgent attempt to prevent the country from collapsing into civil war. In what is being described as a "critical week" for Nato's role in Afghanistan, the British move, due to be announced today, shows that the government is prepared to maintain a significant military presence there despite severe pressure on its already overstretched army.<BR><BR>All three regular battalions of the Parachute Regiment will provide the backbone of 16 Air Assault Brigade when it takes over from the existing UK infantry brigade based in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan, in April, defence officials said. It is believed to be the first time so many paras have been sent on a joint combat mission since the second world war, though the total number of UK troops there will remain at about 7,700. They will be supplied with extra armoured vehicles and new Merlin helicopters. However, pressure on the army has meant the brigade has had to scavenge troops from other regiments to fill manpower gaps. The Ministry of Defence is also expected to announce that Britain's 3 Commando Brigade will take over from 16 Air Assault Brigade in six months' time.<BR><BR>In London today, Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, will have talks with David Miliband, the foreign secretary, in what an official called "an important window to step up the international community's game". The meeting comes at a time of public clashes between Britain, the US and Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, over policy and tactics. Christopher Langton, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), described this week as "critical" for Nato's role in Afghanistan. The Rice-Miliband talks also come on the eve of a Nato defence ministers' meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, which will be dominated by the burgeoning crisis in Afghanistan.<BR><BR>Against a background of transatlantic recrimination over troop contributions and where to deploy them, the Nato meeting is an attempt to reinvigorate policy on Afghanistan by drafting a road map clarifying what Nato is doing there, what it is trying to achieve and how to achieve its aims "within a given timescale", according to an official at the Vilnius session.<BR><BR>The German government, stung by a letter - leaked to the German press - from Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, complaining that it should send more combat troops to Afghanistan, is coming under even more domestic opposition to what are seen as counter-productive American blandishments. Canada, meanwhile, has threatened to withdraw its troops from Kandahar province next year unless other countries contribute more troops.<BR><BR>However, the Guardian has learned that France may increase its military presence. It is "looking at ways [to] share a greater burden", an official said yesterday.<BR><BR>Nato officials sought to put a positive spin on the campaign and depict the security failings as a local problem. Despite the transatlantic recriminations about troop numbers, Nato spokesman James Appathurai said the Nato force had gone from about 8,000 to more than 40,000 in two years. "Force generation in Afghanistan has worked," he said.<BR><BR>But Matt Waldman, Oxfam's Kabul representative, told the Guardian: "Persistent poverty provides the conditions for insecurity to spread. The urgent priority is to achieve a coherent approach which focuses greater efforts and resources on rural development."<BR><BR>Attacks from improvised explosive devices and mines have increased by 69% over the past year, according to Nato .<BR><BR>The IISS yesterday said Britain and its Nato allies were in danger of undermining Karzai, who faces elections next year, by cutting their own side-deals with local leaders. It cited the appointment of a former Taliban commander as the mayor of Musa Qala on the recommendation of the British. The US and Afghan governments have criticised UK plans to train and arm community defence forces and attempts to persuade Taliban fighters to change sides.<BR><BR>Karzai recently blocked the appointment of Lord Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrat leader, as a UN envoy with responsibility for coordinating the international effort in Afghanistan.<BR><BR>Dr John Chipman, director general of the IISS, yesterday warned that the tensions between Nato and the Afghan government were surfacing at a time of "worrying fragility" in the alliance's commitment to the continuing mission in Afghanistan.<BR></P>

And we had limited knowledge about al-Qa'eda and its workings. Those two realities have changed."<BR><BR>Gen Hayden's remarks were the first direct official admission that agency interrogators had used "waterboarding" in questioning "war on terrorism" detainees.<BR><BR>All three were initially held and interrogated at CIA-run detention centres overseas before being transferred in 2006 to the military-run detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<BR><BR>Earlier this year John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer, described the waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah, alleged to have been an aide to Osama bin Laden, the al-Qa'eda leader, and said he had responded "like flipping a switch".<BR><BR>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was al-Qa'eda's operational chief. He was captured in Pakistan in March 2003.<BR><BR>He is reported to have confessed to a wide range of terror atrocities, including planning the September 11 attacks, the earlier World Trade Centre bombing as well as personally beheading Daniel Pearl, the American journalist, in 2002.<BR><BR>Abdul-Rahim al-Nashiri is alleged to have been the mastermind of the USS Cole bombing, who headed al-Qa'eda operations in the Gulf prior to capture in 2002.<BR><BR>Waterboarding involves restraining a prisoner on a board with the subject's head lower than his feet. Water is then poured on the face, triggering a gag reflex and choking the subject.<BR><BR>Michael Mukasey, the US attorney general, has declined to rule on whether waterboarding is torture.<BR><BR>The CIA has not used the technique since 2003 and Gen Hayden prohibited it in 2006.<BR></P>

<P>February 6, 2008<BR><BR><STRONG>Roman Nikolaichik, critic of Vladimir Putin, is sent to mental hospital</STRONG></P>
<P>Tony Halpin in Moscow<BR><BR>An anti-Kremlin activist is being held in a mental hospital in what supporters say is a return to a Soviet-era punishment of dissidents.<BR><BR>Roman Nikolaichik, a parliamentary candidate for The Other Russia, the chess champion Garry Kasparov's anti-Putin coalition, was sent to a psychiatric hospital after police questioned him about his political activities.<BR><BR>Mr Nikolaichik, 27, a lawyer, was detained in Tver, 100 miles (160km) north of Moscow, where he is head of the coalition's local branch. He is also a member of Ares, a monarchist movement in Russia.<BR><BR>Yevgeny Svetovidov, a spokesman for Ares, said that Mr Nikolaichik was a victim of punitive psychiatry after being summoned for questioning by local prosecutors on Friday. He said that they tried initially to fabricate a charge of attempted murder against the activist, then called a doctor who certified him as mentally unstable.<BR><BR>Seeing the obvious absurdity of the fabricated accusation, and anticipating that the case would simply fall apart, the security services decided to employ punitive psychiatry in relation to Nikolaichik, and he was sent for detention to a psychiatric clinic, Mr Svetovidov said. The current process has an obviously political nature, with Nikolaichik's political position and his involvement with The Other Russia coalition serving as its cause.<BR><BR>Mr Nikolaichik, who has a wife and three children, is being held in an isolation ward at the Litvinov pyschiatric hospital in Busharevo, a town in Tver region. Friends and family have been unable to contact him.<BR><BR>He was a prominent member of protest rallies, known as Dissenters' Marches, called by The Other Russia last year. Mr Svetovidov said that Mr Nikolaichik had come under repeated pressure from the security services to leave the group.<BR><BR>The case carries echoes of the treatment of Larissa Arap, an activist for The Other Russia, who was forcibly detained in a pyschiatric hospital for 46 days in the summer. Ms Arap, a journalist, said that she was heavily drugged and threatened after writing an article that exposed abuse of children at the same unit where she was detained in Murmansk, northern Russia.<BR><BR>When she was freed after a public outcry by human rights campaigners, doctors warned her that she would be locked up indefinitely if she talked about her treatment. She was released only after the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, contacted the hospital's chief doctor.<BR><BR>Ms Arap, 49, was arrested after a check-up to obtain a driver's licence. Her case outraged the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, which gave warning of a return to the practice, common during Soviet times, of locking up people who were critical of the authorities.<BR><BR>Punitive psychiatry was used widely by the Soviet Union to silence dissidents by labelling them mentally ill.<BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Northern Ireland on terror alert</STRONG><BR><BR>By Ian Graham, PA<BR>Wednesday, 6 February 2008<BR><BR>Northern Ireland is on terror alert, just days after it was announced the Queen would visit next month.<BR><BR>The Police Service of Northern Ireland issued a warning of an increased terrorist threat.<BR><BR>It said it was "stepping up operations across Northern Ireland to disrupt dissident republicans".<BR><BR>The public would notice increased police activity, including the use of vehicle checkpoints, said a statement.<BR><BR>Checkpoints and other overt security measures have hardly been seen in recent times following the return of devolution last year.<BR><BR>The PSNI said: "The public are urged to be patient and to co-operate with police in this operation which is designed to ensure the safety of the whole community."<BR><BR>The warning came two days after the dissident Real IRA used a Dublin-published Sunday newspaper to claim it was going on the offensive again.<BR><BR>That threat itself came two days after it was announced from Buckingham Palace that the Queen would visit the province on the Thursday before Easter to distribute Maundy Money outside The Church Of Ireland Cathedral in Armagh - the first time a monarch has carried out the ceremony outside England and Wales.<BR><BR>It was thought to be the first time an announcement of a royal visit to Northern Ireland had been announced so far in advance.<BR><BR>Normally such announcements are not made until the royal visitor is actually within the province.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Officer told he would face trial if bugging was revealed</STRONG><BR><BR>Ian Cobain<BR><BR>Scotland Yard officers threatened a former policeman with prosecution under the Official Secrets Act if he divulged what he knew about a covert operation in which an MP's conversations were bugged, the Guardian has learned. In an apparent attempt to conceal the existence of the bugging operation, the Yard told Mark Kearney, a former Thames Valley police detective, that he could be charged with a breach of the act if he discussed his role with anyone.<BR><BR>The threat was made several weeks ago, at a time when a number of journalists were trying to interview Kearney about the operation at Woodhill maximum security prison in Buckinghamshire, where Sadiq Khan, a Labour MP was visiting a constituent. "The police told him they knew what was going on and he should be careful," said one of Kearney's associates. Despite the threat, details of the operation emerged in the Sunday Times at the weekend. Kearney has claimed he wanted no part in the operation but came under "significant pressure" from the Yard. Scotland Yard has refused to comment.<BR><BR>Khan is said to have been deeply upset when he learned of the operation. He had been visiting Babar Ahmad, whom he has known for several years. Ahmad is in Woodhill pending extradition to the US, where he faces charges of involvement in an al-Qaida internet fundraising campaign.<BR><BR>Kearney, 49, stands accused of wilful misconduct in public office after allegedly tipping off a local newspaper reporter about a series of news items. The reporter, Sally Murrer of the Milton Keynes Citizen, has been charged with aiding and abetting him, as has Kearney's son and a former police officer with the Hertfordshire force. All four deny wrongdoing and are due to face trial later this year.<BR><BR>The justice secretary, Jack Straw, has asked the surveillance commissioner, Sir Christopher Rose, to investigate the bugging of Khan's conversations. He said Rose, a former appeal court judge, would report within two weeks.<BR><BR>It emerged last night that the Ministry of Justice took a press query on December 14 about Khan's visits to Ahmad. While the press interest in the meeting was passed to Straw, the surveillance issue was not. He was told there was some interest in Sadiq's visit to the prison but nothing on [surveillance]," one well-placed source said.<BR><BR>Straw told the Commons that the first he knew of the bugging claims was when he was alerted on Saturday to a story in the next day's Sunday Times.<BR></P>

They were trying to ruin him, destroying me in the process," she said.<BR><BR>Mr Kearney was first ordered to bug Mr Khan in Woodhill Prison, Bucks, in 2005, and told Mrs Murrer he had been told to do "something illegal".<BR><BR>In May 2006 police raided the offices of the Milton Keynes Citizen and seized Mrs Murrer's computer. She was later arrested.<BR><BR>Ironically, it seems that it was Mr Kearney's ex-wife Linda who brought the bugging of Mr Khan to his fellow MPs.<BR><BR>Last autumn she went to see her local MP, the Conservative Andrew Selous, to complain about the fact that her house had also been raided by the police even though she and Mr Kearney no longer lived together.<BR><BR>She detailed Mr Kearney's reservations over the bugging of Mr Khan, and The Daily Telegraph understands that Mr Selous alerted the Home Office and David Davis, the shadow home secretary, who in turn wrote to the Prime Minister.<BR><BR>Mr Kearney, 49, is awaiting trial on eight charges of wilful misconduct in a public office.<BR><BR>Thames Valley Police said it would be "inappropriate" to comment on Mrs Murrer's claims.<BR></P>

Change backed by police and civil rights groups<BR>. New review to examine practicality and safeguards<BR><BR>Will Woodward and Richard Norton-Taylor<BR><BR>Gordon Brown is to approve the use of evidence gathered by phone-tapping and other intercept evidence in criminal court cases. <BR>He will make a statement to MPs today on the findings of an independent privy council review, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, a former permanent secretary, which urges changes in the law to allow intercept evidence to be used.<BR><BR>Brown will announce another review, by a civil service committee, to establish how such evidence could be used in practice and ensure safeguards are put in place. Britain is one of the few western countries which does not admit such evidence in court.<BR><BR>Opponents of changes include MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, who have argued that it would reveal their sophisticated intercept techniques. The parliamentary intelligence and security committee said last week the agencies were "adamant that their intercept capabilities must not be disclosed in court". The security services are nervous because changes could allow defence lawyers to demand full disclosure, including transcripts, of the whole operation. Some Whitehall officials also fear any change would be vulnerable to challenge in the courts on human rights grounds. The former home secretary, David Blunkett, told Channel 4 News last night he was "very sympathetic" to the idea that intercept evidence should be allowed but there were "very major challenges".<BR><BR>He added: "There still are, which is why I think the announcement by the prime minister tomorrow will be of a limited nature." Unless the nature of the intercept was properly recorded, defence lawyers could have a "field day", Blunkett said.<BR><BR>But he added: "New methods of communication across the world and locally have changed the nature of way in which tapping takes place."<BR><BR>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "This sounds like a breakthrough. We have been calling for this for years. The use of intercept has proved vital to counter-terrorist efforts almost everywhere else in the world."<BR><BR>Chris Huhne, for the Liberal Democrats, said: "The use of intercept evidence is overdue and will help to bring many criminals to justice without resorting to desperate measures such as a further extension of the period of detention without charge or trial to 42 days." The move came as Brown and the justice secretary, Jack Straw, continued to face criticism over allegations that a government whip, Sadiq Khan, was bugged when he visited Babar Ahmed, achildhood friend and terror suspect, in prison.<BR><BR>Brown's move will be welcomed by civil rights groups, the prosecution service, and the police.<BR><BR>The director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, has long argued that intercept evidence shoud be admissible in court proceedings.<BR><BR>The director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, has argued that the move would allow people, notably terrorist suspects, accused of wrongdoing to know what intelligence was being held against them.<BR><BR>Sir Paul Kennedy, an appeal court judge who monitors communications intercepts, was sceptical.<BR><BR>He said in his official report last week: "I am firmly of the opinion that the benefits of any change in the law [on intercept evidence] are heavily outweighed by the disadvantages."<BR><BR>The intelligence and security committee said last week: "At its simplest, it is a question of whether using intercept material in court would result in more terrorist convictions than are already achieved through its use to generate leads, and whether these would be sufficient to outweigh the possible reduction in the capability of the agencies to identify the terrorists and disrupt the attacks in the first place."<BR><BR>Backstory<BR><BR>Sir John Chilcot was asked last July to lead an independent review considering whether tapped phone conversations should be allowed as evidence in court. Recordings from free-standing bugs are currently admissible in a criminal trial, as are recordings where one of the speakers is an undercover police officer. Phone-tap evidence gathered abroad is also allowed to be put before a jury, but intercepts of land lines or mobile phones can only be used for intelligence gathering, and are not admissible in court. Civil liberties groups have called for the ban to be lifted, arguing that it offers an alternative to lengthy pre-charge detention, but the intelligence services fear it could expose details of their operations. Some 800 public bodies can currently request personal communications data, including every police force, prison and 474 local authorities, as well as the security and intelligence agencies.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Met police put pressure on me, claims former detective who says he bugged MP</STRONG><BR><BR>. Khan 'not intended target' of covert listening device<BR>. Straw orders inquiry by former appeal court judge<BR><BR>Ian Cobain and Vikram Dodd<BR><BR>A former detective last night said that he was the officer who had bugged a conversation between a Labour MP and a terrorism suspect held in prison. Mark Kearney, 49, whose duties included operations at Woodhill prison in Buckinghamshire, said that he had been under "significant pressure from the Metropolitan police" to covertly record a conversation between Sadiq Khan MP and his constituent Babar Ahmad.<BR><BR>Kearney retired from Thames Valley police last year after 30 years of service, having been charged with several counts of misconduct in public office. He told the BBC: "I did record the visit but have never thought it was justified in these circumstances."<BR><BR>He said he was concerned that senior officers in his force were authorising bugging of an MP's conversations. The justice secretary, Jack Straw, has said that the first he had heard of the matter was at the weekend, despite a Tory claim they brought it to the attention of No 10 in December through a letter from the shadow home secretary, David Davis. Downing Street denied any knowledge of the letter.<BR><BR>But a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman did say last night: "MoJ officials became aware in December of issues concerning visits to Woodhill prison by Sadiq Khan MP." Mr Davis questioned why ministers had not been informed.<BR><BR>Police bugged a conversation between Khan and Ahmad as the pair discussed a civil action the inmate was bringing against the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir Ian Blair, for an alleged assault by Scotland Yard officers, it was claimed yesterday.<BR><BR>At least two conversations between the men were monitored at the request of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism branch, sources confirmed yesterday.<BR><BR>They claimed that the conversations between Ahmad and those visiting him in jail were bugged between 2004 and 2006, and that the conversations with Khan had not been a specific target of the police.<BR><BR>Last night a Daily Mail report suggested that conversations between Ahmad and Khan had been recorded in 2004, before Khan became MP for Tooting, south London, at the 2005 general election.<BR><BR>With questions mounting about the police's involvement and the use of their powers, Straw yesterday announced an inquiry into the allegations, to be headed by a former judge.<BR><BR>Ahmad's lawyer told the Guardian that during the second bugged conversation in June 2006, Khan discussed with his constituent the civil action for an alleged assault in December 2003 when Ahmad was first arrested.<BR><BR>Ahmad's solicitor, Fiona Murphy, has written to the prison service saying that the conversation had apparently "been covertly recorded in contravention of the Wilson doctrine". Scotland Yard refused to answer questions yesterday.<BR><BR>Two sources say that an operation monitoring Ahmad began after his arrest and imprisonment following the US extradition request in 2004, and ran through to at least summer 2006.<BR><BR>However, senior Met officers are particularly worried about the accusation that they singled out Khan, a former rights lawyer who represented clients who had successfully sued the police.<BR><BR>Before the visits in May 2005 and June 2006 Khan would have submitted a visiting order. Sources say it was not clearly stated that Khan was an MP - and thus officers involved may not have realised a doctrine banning the bugging of MPs should have applied.<BR><BR>The bugging, using a device secreted under a table over which the two men talked, was by Thames Valley police but was requested by Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism branch, which in Deceber 2003 originally made the arrest Ahmad was suing over; he was released after six days without charge.<BR><BR>He then made an official complaint about the alleged assault, claiming he was kicked and punched, and taunted by an officer who said: "Where is your God now?" A medical report showed he had had 50 separate injuries.<BR><BR>In August 2004 he was arrested after the US requested his extradition, alleging he ran a support network for terrorists in Chechnya and Afghanistan.<BR><BR>Straw told the Commons yesterday that no minister was involved in the decision to bug Khan. He appointed Sir Christopher Rose, the chief surveillance commissioner and former appeal court judge, to inquire and report within two weeks if possible. Even if the facts of the surveillance operation are established, the government and police could argue that no rules or laws have been broken.<BR><BR>Straw told the Commons that any bugging of "phone calls and other public telecommunications" required a warrant signed by the home secretary or foreign secretary. But rules for other surveillance operations were different, requiring only authorisation from a chief police officer.<BR><BR>Gordon Brown's spokesman said last night that there may still be implications for the Wilson doctrine. "The government thinks it's important there is a full and thorough inquiry."<BR><BR><A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2252556,00.html" target=_blank>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk<WBR>_news/story/0,,2252556,00.html</A><BR></P>

<P>February 5, 2008<BR><BR><STRONG>Illegal bug uncovered in second UK prison</STRONG><BR><BR>Richard Ford, Home Correspondent and Sean ONeill, Security Editor<BR><BR>Bugging devices planted in a prison telephone were illegally used to record privileged conversations between an inmate and his solicitor, The Times has learnt.<BR><BR>Defence lawyers said last night that the breach confirms long-held suspicions that the recording of legal visits is widespread. Security experts told The Times that they believed that dozens of prisoners are routinely the subject of covert surveillance.<BR><BR>The revelation comes days after it emerged that an MPs meeting with a jailed constituent had been recorded. However the taping of legal meetings is considered far more serious because it may breach a defendants rights and has the potential to collapse criminal trials.<BR><BR>The full transcripts of the taped conversations with a 71-year-old man who is serving life for murder only came to light because they were disclosed to Simon Creighton, the solicitor who was caught up in the surveillance.<BR><BR>The revelation will bring demands for Jack Straw to widen the official inquiry into the bugging of Sadiq Khan, a Muslim MP visiting a terror suspect, to investigate the extent of covert surveillance in Britains prisons.<BR><BR>Mr Straw, the Justice Secretary, told MPs yesterday that Sir Christopher Rose, the Chief Surveillance Commissioner, is to head an inquiry into the bugging of a conversation involving Mr Khan and Babar Ahmad when the MP visited him in Woodhill jail.<BR><BR>Mr Creightons case involves Harry Roberts, who was convicted of the murder of three police officers in Shepherds Bush, West London, in 1966. Last night the solicitor said: If they are prepared to go to these lengths in this case, it makes one wonder what they are prepared to do with other prisoners, particularly those convicted of serious offences.<BR><BR>Roberts, currently in Littlehey prison in Cambridgeshire, is involved in a long battle to be released on parole. His 30-year minimum term expired 11 years ago.<BR><BR>His parole hearings have been held in secret but in documents sent to his solicitor, a government-appointed lawyer included transcripts of bugged telephone conversations. Two transcripts of discussions betweeen Mr Creighton and Roberts when he was in Channings Wood jail were found with other legal documents.<BR><BR>The transcripts of calls made in 2005 and 2006 include every word spoken from the moment that a receptionist at Mr Creightons firm answers the phone to Roberts and he asks: Can I speak to Simon.<BR><BR>Mr Creighton said that the transcripts included discussions of legal tactics that he was going to employ in court proceedings planned as part of Robertss struggle to win parole. They also included discussions about problems that Roberts was having in jail.<BR><BR>Mr Creighton, of Bhatt Murphy solicitors in London, said: I am deeply shocked by this breach of such an important and fundamental right. It is especially worrying that it occurred in this case where there were already heightened sensitivities because of the decision made by the parole board to receive secret evidence.<BR><BR>Had the secrecy order not been lifted it would never have come to light and it makes me wonder whether this is a more common practice than anyone has previously dared to imagine.<BR><BR>He said that the bugging of legal telephone calls was a breach of common law and the European Convention of Human Rights.<BR><BR>It is not clear whether the bugging operation was being operated by the police or prison service.<BR><BR>The telephone calls of all prisoners are subject to monitoring but the recording or monitoring of calls to legal advisers is banned.<BR><BR>Prisoners have expressed concerns frequently that telephone calls with their lawyers and legal visits are being bugged. Mr Creighton said: There has always been a degree of paranoia among prisoners that their calls are recorded. Sometimes they say that clicks heard during conversations are recordings being switched off. Whenever this has been raised with the authorities they have always denied it.<BR><BR>Gareth Peirce, Mr Ahmads solicitor, said that defence lawyers had written to the governors of Woodhill and Belmarsh prisons on a number of occasions seeking assurances that legal visits were not being bugged.<BR><BR>Ms Peirce said: Many prisoners . . . believe that their visits are being listened to and defence lawyers are concerned that they are not able to reassure them on that score.<BR><BR>The position is very disturbing. Bugging of legal visits would be a serious intrusion. There is an absolute right to confidentiality when it comes to legal visits. To justify such a thing happening would need the Home Secretary to authorise it. If it were found to have happened, that would have the most enormous consequences..<BR><BR>The Ministry of Justice said last night: The Justice Secretary was not previously aware of this matter.<BR><BR>We will consider what further steps are needed once we have more information.<BR><BR><A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3308564.ece" target=_blank>http://www.timesonline.co.uk<WBR>/tol/news/uk/crime/article3308<WBR>564.ece</A><BR></P>

<P>February 5, 2008<BR><BR><STRONG>Prisoners routinely bugged as jails fall in shadowy area of surveillance<BR></STRONG><BR>Sean O'Neill, Crime &amp; Security Editor and Richard Ford, Home Correspondent<BR><BR>Dozens of prisoners in British jails are routinely under covert electronic surveillance, security sources told The Times last night.<BR><BR>The controversy over the bugging of conversations between Sadiq Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, and his friend and constituent, Babar Ahmad, at Woodhill prison, Buckinghamshire, highlighted the shadowy area of covert intelligence gathering in jails.<BR><BR>The operation to monitor Mr Ahmad, who is fighting extradition to the United States, where he is wanted on terrorism charges, was authorised without the knowledge of ministers.<BR><BR>It was authorised by senior police officers. Scotland Yard, which takes the lead on counter-terrorist operations, and Thames Valley Police, in whose force area Woodhill lies, were aware of it. Neither is prepared to comment.<BR><BR>It was reported last night that the bugging was carried out by Mark Kearney, 49, a former sergeant with Thames Valley Police who is currently facing prosecution for allegations of wilful misconduct in a public office. He was a police intelligence officer inside Woodhill prison and has said in court documents that he was under pressure from the Metropolitan Police to carry out surveillance on the meeting between the MP and his constituent.<BR><BR>Authority for the surveillance was renewed every 28 days, ran continuously for a long period and might still be continuing. Mr Ahmad is now held in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire.<BR><BR>According to reports last night, the bugging of Mr Khan and Mr Ahmad may have begun as long ago as 2004 &nbsp;before Mr Khan became an MP.<BR><BR>Eavesdropping operations are conducted on a significant number of terrorist inmates and on a large number of prisoners linked to organised crime networks. They are used to monitor communication with people outside the jail and can yield vital intelligence about terrorist plots, drug shipments and other criminal activity.<BR><BR>A security source said it was often not possible to switch the surveillance on and off and collateral damage could occur when exchanges between prisoners and their lawyers or MPs might be recorded. Such material was discarded, the source insisted.<BR><BR>The Times was told last night that the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office were told at official level that the bugging of conversations at Woodhill had taken place, but that it was not necessarily clear that the police knew that an MP had been involved in the conversations. It was also said that ministers had not been told of the tapping and that the first Mr Straw knew about it was this weekend when he was informed of the report inThe Sunday Times. Ministry of Justice officials became aware in December of issues concerning visits to Woodhill prison by Sadiq Khan, the ministry said.<BR><BR>David Davis, the Shadow Home Secretary, described as extraordinary the allegation that Mark Kearney had been pressurised into the bugging.<BR><BR>Downing Street had previously said that it never received a letter about the issue from Mr Davis. Last night the Shadow Home Secretary said: After the lame excuse from No 10, it is becoming apparent that the Government did know about this very serious issue - at the time I wrote my letter.<BR><BR>It is beyond belief that the department would not flag up to a minister that the Wilson Doctrine had been broken within the department.<BR><BR>There are currently 130 Category A terrorist prisoners in British jails, and the potential for Islamists to radicalise other Muslim prisoners and convert impressionable inmates is seen by counter-terrorism police officers as a serious threat. Belmarsh jail holds the largest concentration. There have been discussions about dispersing the inmates but that would risk widening the circle of inmates they could influence.<BR><BR>Last year Phil Wheatley, the Direc-tor-General of the Prison Service, told the Home Affairs Select Committee he believed that holding all terrorists in one jail was dangerous. They can form a very tight cell structure and be much more dangerous with what they can do in prison and sometimes what they plan to do outside, he said.<BR><BR>All Category A prisoners are subjected to mandatory monitoring of their telephone calls and mail. In some cases, evidence of monitored calls can be admitted as evidence in trials.<BR><BR>If the inquiry set up by Mr Straw concludes that the bugging of Mr Ahmad was illegal, it could lead to the prisoner taking action in the courts. His lawyers are examining whether taping his discussion with his MP breaches his right to privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights.<BR><BR><A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3308429.ece" target=_blank>http://www.timesonline.co.uk<WBR>/tol/news/uk/crime/article3308<WBR>429.ece</A><BR></P>

They have grudgingly become accustomed to being seen as propeller-headed geeks who poke their finger in the eye of the governments satellite spymasters, Mr. Molczan said, taking no offense. I have a sense of humor, he said.<BR><BR>Mr. Molczan, a private energy conservation consultant, is the best known of the satellite spotters who, needing little more than a pair of binoculars, a stop watch and star charts, uncover some of the deepest of the governments expensive secrets and share them on the Internet.<BR><BR>Thousands of people form the spotter community. Many look for historical relics of the early space age, working from publicly available orbital information. Others watch for phenomena like the distinctive flare of sunlight glinting off bright solar panels of some telephone satellites. Still others are drawn to the secretive world of spy satellites, with about a dozen hobbyists who do most of the observing, Mr. Molczan said.<BR><BR>In the case of the mysterious satellite that is about to plunge back to earth, Mr. Molczan had an early sense of which one it was, identifying it as USA-193, which gave out shortly after reaching space in December 2006. It is said to have been built by the Lockheed Martin Corporation and operated by the secretive National Reconnaissance Office.<BR><BR>Another hobbyist, John Locker of Britain, posted photos of the satellite on a Web site, <A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://galaxypix.com/" target=_blank>galaxypix.com</A>.<BR><BR>John E. Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a private group in Alexandria, Va., that tracks military and space activities, said the hobbyists exemplified fundamental principles of openness and of the power of technology to change the game.<BR><BR>It has been an important demystification of these things, Mr. Pike said, because I think there is a tendency on the part of these agencies just to try to pretend that they dont exist, and that nothing can be known about them.<BR><BR>But the spotters are also pursuing a thoroughly unusual pastime, one that calls for long hours outside, freezing in the winter and sweating in the summer, straining to see a moving light in the sky and hoping that a slip of the finger on the stopwatch does not delete an entire nights work. And for the adept, there is math. Lots of math.<BR><BR>Its somewhat time consuming and tedious, Mr. Molczan said, acknowledging that the precise and methodical activities might seem, to the uninitiated, a close approximation to work.<BR><BR>When a new spy satellite is launched, the hobbyists will collaborate on sightings around the world to determine its orbit, and even guess at its function, sharing their information through the e-mail network SeeSat-L, which can be found via the Web site <A onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" href="http://satobs.org/" target=_blank>satobs.org</A>.<BR><BR>From his 23rd-floor balcony, or the roof of his 32-floor building, Mr. Molzcan will peer through his binoculars at a point in the sky he expects the satellite to cross, which he locates with star charts. When the moving dot appears, he determines its direction and the distance it travels across the patch of sky over time, which he can use to calculate its speed.<BR><BR>Mr. Molzcan declined a request to visit him in Toronto and to be photographed for this article, saying: No offense intended, but this is beginning to sound like more of a human interest story than one about the substance of the hobby. My preference is for the latter. Also, I prefer not to have photos of myself published.<BR><BR>Mr. Locker, who favors a telescope for his camerawork, said that people like him and Mr. Molczan were not, as he put it, nerdy buffs who lie on our backs and look into the sky and try to undermine governments. Spotting, he said, is simply a hobby.<BR><BR>There are people who look at train timetables and go watch trains, he said. People are drawn to what interests them, he said, and its what draws people to any hobby.<BR><BR>While recent news coverage has focused on the current satellites threat to people when it falls from above, that threat is, statistically, very small. Even when the space shuttle Columbia broke up over Texas five years ago and rained debris over two states, no one on the ground was injured.<BR><BR>Gordon Johndroe, a spokesman for the National Security Council, noted that 328 satellites had come down in the past five years without injury to anyone. While Mr. Johndroe declined to divulge much about the current satellite aside from the fact that it carries no nuclear material, he said that the government would take responsibility in the remote chance of damage or injury.<BR><BR>The governments relationship with the hobbyists is not a comfortable one. Spokesmen for the National Reconnaissance Office have stated that they would prefer the hobbyists not publish their information, and suggest that foreign countries try to hide their activities when they know an eye in the sky will be passing overhead.<BR><BR>The satellite spotters acknowledge that this may be so, though they doubt that such tactics are effective. Mr. Molczan said he believed that the hobbyists hurt no one but that you cant say with absolute certainty what effect youre having.<BR><BR>Mr. Pike said the officials who complained about the hobbyists dont like it, but theyve got to lump it. Despite the many clever ways that the spy agencies try to minimize the likelihood that their satellites will be spotted, he said, they will be. And that, he said, is a valuable warning: a world with so many eyes on the skies renders deep secrets shallow.<BR><BR>If Ted can track all these satellites, Mr. Pike said, so can the Chinese.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Iran claims launch into 'space' of rocket capable of taking satellites<BR></STRONG><BR>Robert Tait<BR><BR>Iran signalled its ambition to join the elite group of nations in space yesterday by claiming to have reached orbit with a rocket capable of carrying satellites. In a move that drew criticism from the Bush administration, Iranian television beamed footage of the rocket, called Explorer-1, being fired after Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, gave the launch order. Officials in the control room were heard chanting "God is great" as it lifted off. State TV said the rocket had reached "space", generally defined as 62.5miles above earth.<BR><BR>The launch is a major landmark for Ahmadinejad, who said during a ceremony opening Iran's first space centre: "We need to have an active and influential presence in space. Building and launching a satellite is a very important achievement." During his visit, he also donned special glasses to view a 3-D film about space.<BR><BR>A White House spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, condemned the test, saying: "It's unfortunate Iran continues to test ballistic missiles. This regime continues to take steps that only further isolate it and the Iranian people from the international community."<BR><BR>The test was a forerunner to the anticipated launch early next year of Iran's first satellite, Omid (Hope), which Iranian scientists have reportedly spent 10 years developing. If it is fired successfully, Iran will become the 11th nation to have its own satellite in orbit since the Soviet Union successfully launched the first in 1957. A satellite jointly developed by Iran and Russia was launched on Russian soil in 2005.<BR><BR>Iran insists the Omid satellite will be used to improve phone and internet services while also monitoring natural disasters. But some analysts say it will also give the Islamic regime the capacity to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are guided using satellite technology.<BR><BR>Bhavini Rama, at the Centre for Defence and International Security Studies, said Tehran had not released enough detail for observers to assess whether Omid could be used for such purposes.<BR><BR>"It's probably going to be an observation satellite and could be used for intelligence purposes," she said. "This is a big step for Iran but it still has a long way to go in terms of catching up with the US and other space powers."<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Revealed: British plan to build training camp for Taliban fighters in Afghanistan</STRONG><BR><BR>By Jerome Starkey in Kabul<BR><BR>Britain planned to build a Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters in southern Afghanistan, as part of a top-secret deal to make them swap sides, intelligence sources in Kabul have revealed. The plans were discovered on a memory stick seized by Afghan secret police in December.<BR><BR>The Afghan government claims they prove British agents were talking to the Taliban without permission from the Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, despite Gordon Brown's pledge that Britain will not negotiate. The Prime Minister told Parliament on 12 December: "Our objective is to defeat the insurgency by isolating and eliminating their leaders. We will not enter into any negotiations with these people."<BR><BR>The British insist President Karzai's office knew what was going on. But Mr Karzai has expelled two top diplomats amid accusations they were part of a plot to buy-off the insurgents.<BR><BR>The row was the first in a series of spectacular diplomatic spats which has seen Anglo-Afghan relations sink to a new low. Since December, President Karzai has blocked the appointment of Paddy Ashdown to the top UN job in Kabul and he has blamed British troops for losing control of Helmand.<BR><BR>It has also soured relations between Kabul and Washington, where State Department officials were instrumental in pushing Lord Ashdown for the UN role.<BR><BR>President Karzai's political mentor, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, endorsed a death sentence for blasphemy on the student journalist Sayed Pervez Kambaksh last week, and two British contractors have been arrested in Kabul on, it is claimed, trumped up weapons charges. The developments are seen as a deliberate defiance of the British.<BR><BR>An Afghan government source said the training camp was part of a British plan to use bands of reconciled Taliban, called Community Defence Volunteers, to fight the remaining insurgents. "The camp would provide military training for 1,800 ordinary Taliban fighters and 200 low-level commanders," he said.<BR><BR>The computer memory stick at the centre of the row was impounded by officers from Afghanistan's KGB-trained National Directorate of Security after they moved against a party of international diplomats who were visiting Helmand.<BR><BR>A ministry insider said: "When they were arrested, the British said the Ministry of the Interior and the National Security Council knew about it, but no one knew anything. That's why the President was so angry."<BR><BR>Details of how much President Karzai was told remain murky. Some analysts believe Afghan officials were briefed about the plan, but that it later evolved.<BR><BR>The camp was due to be built outside Musa Qala, in Helmand. It was part of a package of reconstruction and development incentives designed to win trust and support in the aftermath of the British-led battle to retake the stronghold last year.<BR><BR>But the Afghans feared the British were training a militia with no loyalty to the central government. Intercepted Taliban communications suggested they thought the British were trying to help them, the Afghan official said.<BR><BR>The Western delegates, Michael Semple and Mervyn Patterson, were given 48 hours to leave the country. Their Afghan colleagues, including a former army general, were jailed. The expulsions coincided with a row within the Taliban's ranks which saw a senior commander, Mansoor Dadullah, sacked for talking to British spies. One official claimed the camp was planned for Mansoor and his men.<BR><BR>The computer stick contained a three-stage plan, called the European Union Peace Building Programme. The third stage covered military training.<BR><BR>Curiously, the European Union says the programme did not exist and there were no EU funds to run it.<BR><BR>Afghan government officials insist it was bankrolled by the British. UK diplomats, the UN, Western officials and senior Afghan officials have all confirmed the outline of the plan, which they agree is entirely British-led, but all refused to talk about it on the record. President Karzai's office claimed it was "a matter of national security".<BR><BR>The memory stick revealed that $125,000 (&#163;64,000) had been spent on preparing the camp and a further $200,000 was earmarked to run it in 2008, an Afghan official said. The figures sparked allegations that British agents were paying the Taliban.<BR><BR>President Karzai's spokesman, Humayun Hamidzada, accused Mr Semple and Mr Patterson of being "involved in some activities that were not their jobs."<BR><BR>The camp would also have provided vocational training, including farming and irrigation techniques, to offer people a viable alternative to growing opium. But the Afghan government took issue with plans to provide military training, to turn the insurgents into a defence force.<BR><BR>Afghan government staff also claimed the "EU peace-builders" had handed over mobile phones, laptops and airtime credit to insurgents. They said the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use secure satellite phones, so they could communicate directly with UK officials.<BR><BR>Mr Patterson, a Briton, was the third-ranking UN diplomat when he was held. Mr Semple, an Irishman, was the acting head of the EU mission. Officially, the British embassy remains tight-lipped, fuelling speculation that the plan may have been part of a wider clandestine operation.<BR><BR>A spokesman repeated the line used since Christmas: "The EU and UN have responded to inquiries on this. We have nothing further to add."<BR><BR>But privately, the UN maintains it had no role in setting up the camp. Meanwhile, Mr Semple's EU boss, Francesc Vendrell, admitted he had very little idea what was going on.<BR><BR>Yet the British ambassador, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, cut short his Christmas holiday to meet President Karzai and "spell out the Foreign Office paper-trail" which diplomats claim proves his government had agreed. They met twice, but it was not enough to stop Mr Semple and Mr Patterson being forced to leave.<BR><BR>Gordon Brown has also said Britain would increase its support for "community defence initiatives, where local volunteers are recruited to defend homes and families modelled on traditional Afghan arbakai".<BR><BR>Background to the proposal<BR><BR>* December 11<BR><BR>British and Afghan troops take Musa Qala, a Taliban stronghold in Helmand, after President Hamid Karzai reveals that a senior Taliban commander swapped sides.<BR><BR>* December 23-24<BR><BR>The acting head of the EU mission, Michael Semple, and the third-ranking UN diplomat in Afghanistan, Mervyn Patterson, hold talks with local dignitaries and Taliban sympathisers in Helmand. Afghan secret police arrest their colleague, General Stanikzai, and seize a memory stick containing plans for training camps.<BR><BR>* December 25<BR><BR>Semple and Patterson are given 48 hours in which to leave Kabul.<BR><BR>* December 27<BR><BR>The two diplomats fly out of the Afghan capital, despite international appeals to let them stay.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Watchdog calls for an end to politicians' 40-year-old exemption</STRONG><BR><BR>Richard Norton-Taylor<BR><BR>The allegation that Sadiq Khan was bugged during a prison meeting with a constituent comes at a time of growing opposition in the security and intelligence community to the decades-old edict that they must not target members of parliament. Last week Sir Paul Kennedy, an appeal court judge who monitors the activities of the police and security and intelligence agencies in his role as interception of communications commissioner, said it was time the edict - established by Harold Wilson in 1966 - was abandoned. "In times like these it seems to me to be totally indefensible," he said in his annual report. Kennedy made it clear he shared the view of his predecessor, Sir Swinton Thomas, who campaigned to scrap what became known as the Wilson Doctrine.<BR><BR>"The doctrine means that MPs and peers can engage in serious crime or terrorism without running the risk of being investigated in the same way as any other member of the public," Thomas said in his final annual report last year. "It is fundamental to the constitution of this country that no one is above the law or is seen to be above the law. But in this instance MPs and peers are anything but equal with the rest of the citizens of this country and are above the law. "Of course, I do not think that members of parliament are engaging in serious crime and terrorism ... however, to maintain that no MP or peer has or ever will engage in serious crime is absurd."<BR><BR>He could find no logical or principled objection to change "apart from self-interest". MPs in other European countries did not enjoy such protection, he said.<BR><BR>Tony Blair and John Reid, when home secretary, indicated that they agreed the Wilson Doctrine should be dropped. However, Blair was persuaded otherwise by other members of his cabinet and MPs. "It should be maintained," he told the Commons in a written statement in November 2006. That position was echoed in the Commons by Gordon Brown shortly after he became prime minister last July.<BR><BR>The Wilson Doctrine referred to the interception of communications, which in 1966 meant physical tapping of telephone lines.<BR><BR>It is much easier for the security and intelligence services to obtain warrants to plant bugs and other devices which were not around in Harold Wilson's day.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Human rights lawyer, MP, and thorn in the Met's side</STRONG><BR><BR>Profile: Sadiq Khan<BR><BR>Vikram Dodd<BR><BR>Sadiq Khan is a rising star in Labour's ranks and a former human rights lawyer who championed cases which embarrassed Scotland Yard. He represented several ethnic minority police officers investigated for corruption who were cleared and received compensation from the Metropolitan police.<BR><BR>The most bitter case was that of Ali Dizaei, who was subjected to a year of covert surveillance, suspended amid allegations that he had consorted with prostitutes and threatened national security, and ultimately cleared after an Old Bailey trial for alleged corruption.<BR><BR>The head of the squad behind the cases was Andy Hayman, and the man with oversight of his unit was the then deputy commissioner Ian Blair. When Khan was allegedly bugged in 2005 and 2006 the head of the counter terrorism command was Andy Hayman, whose boss is the commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. Hayman will leave the force in March having quit after allegations about his conduct and expenses claims. Scotland Yard sources doubt that any animus towards Khan for his work fighting the Met could have played a part in any decision to bug his conversations.<BR><BR>Khan, 37, became a partner in the London firm Christian Khan, and in May 2005 was elected as an MP for Tooting, south London. It is the area he was born in and where he met one of his childhood friends, Babar Ahmad, the constituent whose meeting with him in Woodhill prison was allegedly bugged by police.<BR><BR>Ahmad was arrested in 2004 on an extradition warrant from the United States over allegations that he used the internet to raise funds for terrorists, which he denies. His large family is based mainly in Khan's Tooting constituency and Khan has spoken out against the extradition.<BR><BR>His voting record is mostly loyal, though he was one of a handful of new MPs to vote against Tony Blair's plans to hold terrorism suspects for 90 days without trial.<BR><BR>In early 2007 Khan was appointed as the parliamentary private secretary to Jack Straw, who was then the leader of the House of Commons.<BR><BR>In July 2007 the new prime minister, Gordon Brown, made Khan a minister in the government whip's office. He has special responsibility for managing Ministry of Justice legislation, including that for prisons.<BR><BR>After just months in the Commons Khan won the Newcomer of the Year award in the Spectator magazine's Parliamentarian of the Year awards 2005.<BR><BR>He was also runner-up in Channel 4's Rising Star award, and has been hailed as "one to watch" by both the Independent and the New Statesman.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Inquiry is vital to retain Muslim confidence - MP<BR></STRONG><BR>. Police refuse to say who authorised surveillance<BR>. Law on eavesdropping is a minefield says Liberty<BR><BR>Vikram Dodd and Clare Dyer<BR><BR>The Labour MP Sadiq Khan welcomed a government inquiry yesterday into alleg-ations that Scotland Yard had bugged conversations between him and a constituent acccused of terrorist offences. Khan said: "Constituents should have the confidence to speak to their MP in confidence, with candour so they can be helped with their case. My phone has rung off the hook with constituents who are concerned and annoyed."<BR><BR>The Metropolitan police would not discuss the case and refused to answer whether the alleged interception was authorised by the former head of counter-terrorism, Andy Hayman, who stood down in December, or the commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. Last year Sir Ian was heavily criticised after it was revealed he had taped a private conversation with the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, without seeking permission.<BR><BR>In a statement a Scotland Yard spokesman said: "We do not discuss matters of national security." The use of bugging devices is governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, which states that authorisation is required to place a bug in residential premises, defined in the act as including prisons. Authorisation can be given by the prison governor if that function has been delegated by the secretary of state, or by a very senior police officer - in the case of the Met, at commissioner or assistant commissioner level.<BR><BR>The bugging would have to be considered necessary for the investigation of a serious crime. Prison rules make specific provision for visits from a prisoner's lawyer, which are protected by privilege, and prisoners' correspondence with MPs is considered confidential and will not be opened. But there is no reference to visits by MPs.<BR><BR>"The law on this kind of surveillance is a bit of a minefield," said Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights group Liberty. "Nobody is saying it's never permissible to bug an MP. If you thought that the MP was up to no good or part of a conspiracy, that would be justified. The same is true of lawyers. But you would think this decision would be made at the very highest level."<BR><BR>The Muslim Council of Britain said it wanted urgent meetings with the government over the "appalling" allegations which could damage confidence in the police: "Today's revelations are simply appalling and raise a whole range of vital issues to do with confidentiality and how to hold to account the improper behaviour of senior police officers. This kind of behaviour cannot but do immense damage to the level of trust between Muslim communities and the police."<BR><BR>Last night the solicitor Imran Khan, who has represented several terrorism suspects, said any inquiry should examine allegations that legally privileged conversations between lawyers and clients accused of terrorism are bugged: "It is an unwritten understanding that they bug lawyers conversations with their clients in terrorism cases."<BR><BR>It is a suspicion shared by Gareth Peirce, a solicitor who also represents those accused of terrorist offences: "Almost all prisoners and many defence lawyers would have concerns that their legal conversations were being monitored."<BR><BR>Ahmad has now been moved to Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire. His family also suspect their conversations with him have been bugged.<BR></P>

<P>February 4, 2008<BR><BR><STRONG>Two targets, one dilemma: to defend the Earth or the skies?</STRONG><BR>Magnus Linklater and Dominic Kennedy<BR><BR>To the team from the Air Warfare Centre, a jaunt to rural Wales to monitor the effect of wind farms on radar should have been a routine and pleasant mission.<BR><BR>Two elderly RAF planes were spared for the experiment and their pilots ordered to do figures-of-eight around some windmills to see if they were visible as dots on screens.<BR><BR>The defence experts discovered an alarming threat to national security from wind farms which now seriously jeopardises the expansion of this mode of green energy. Experts knew that there was a tiny area around wind farms where low lying planes are difficult to see by radar and this exercise was designed to measure the extent of the problem.<BR><BR>One of the team noticed an aeroplane, not part of the experiment, which was flying over the turbines but failed to be picked up on the screens.<BR><BR>The pilots of the Chinook HC Mk 2 and Tucano T Mk 1 were given new orders to fly directly over the Llandinam wind farm in South Wales at various altitudes. The planes became quite invisible. A follow-up experiment confirmed that there is a blind spot over wind farms which makes aircraft undetectable by radar.<BR><BR>The discovery has left ministers with a dreadful dilemma. Britain is relying on a huge increase in wind power to help to reduce carbon emissions and so meet targets to prevent catastrophic climate change. But the defence of the skies has become all the more urgent since 9/11 when terrorists shocked America by commandeering four commercial flights.<BR><BR>President Bush has claimed that the CIA foiled a massacre plot to crash aircraft into the towers of Canary Wharf in East London. If the RAF has to be scrambled to save Britain from such peril, every second of advance warning will count.<BR><BR>The revolution in the Ministry of Defences thinking on radar air defence was disclosed by Squadron Leader Chris Breedon in his evidence opposing a new wind farm in North-umbria. Traditionally, the primary role of the Air Surveillance and Control System has been to detect aircraft approaching the UK from overseas. However, equal, if not more, importance is now given to monitoring UK airspace to detect, track and respond to any aircraft which is giving concern.<BR><BR>The significance of the low-level radar cover has risen markedly as a result of the terrorist events of September 11, 2001. The MoD is extremely concerned with any proposed wind turbine development which would have an impact on the . . . system.<BR><BR>Put simply, the operators are less worried about looking for enemy aircraft approaching from overseas. The real threat is over our heads. The full results of the tests remain classified.<BR><BR>Wind farms confuse radar because the turbines are mistaken for planes. They are high and have rotating blades which can mimic the effect of aircraft when detected by radio waves. The British Wind Energy Association says that the existing 165 farms produce enough energy for 1.3 million homes and save 5 million tonnes of carbon a year. Ministers were faced with a choice of disasters to avert. Mass terrorist attack or calamitous rise in temperatures?<BR><BR>The MoD is raising last-minute objections to wind farms at Hexham and Kirkwhelpington in Northumberland, Berwick-upon-Tweed and the Lammermuir Hills in the Scottish Borders, Routh in the East Riding of Yorkshire, Thorney near Peterbor-ough and Ceres in Fife. Campaigners for wind farms are suspicious that the MoD has adopted a hardline policy some time after the scientific evidence was discovered. Experiments which found that radar has blind spots over wind farms were completed in September 2004 and April 2005. In May 2005 the MoD confirmed it had no objections to a proposal for 62 turbines up to 125m high at Fallago Rig in the Lammermuirs. But in March 2007 it objected to a smaller plan for 48 turbines.<BR><BR>The MoD said in documents for a public inquiry: The [air surveillance system] has received firm direction from the Chief of the Defence Staff on the minimum acceptable surveillance coverage and this informs the objection to the wind turbine development. That directed surveillance coverage is required to undertake counter-terror-ist operations against airborne threats and allow tactical decisions to be taken as situations develop. A degraded or inaccurate picture could delay, or even negate, appropriate actions.<BR><BR>The blind spots can arise even at long distances from radar stations and the MoD is studying all proposed wind farms in the line of sight of their monitors. The ministry declined to say how far the line of sight can be.<BR><BR>Security objections threaten to scupper the new age of wind power. Yet in December the Energy Secretary, John Hutton, announced that Britain wants a 60-fold increase in wind energy by 2020. A new radar system called T102 is due to be introduced in two of Britains six monitoring stations &nbsp;at Trimingham in Norfolk and Brizlee Wood in Northumberland.<BR><BR>The Chief of Defence Staffs insistence that there must be no degradation of radar cover appears irreconcilable with the countrys energy ambitions.

<P><STRONG>Detectives turn attention to Northern Cyprus as search for missing Securitas millions continues</STRONG><BR><BR>Police believe suspect is on northern coast in area known as criminal haven<BR><BR>Duncan Campbell in Kyrenia<BR><BR>When five members of the gang who carried out Britain's biggest ever robbery were jailed at the Old Bailey last week for playing for what the judge described as "uniquely high stakes", it was to Northern Cyprus that the attention shifted. With only &#163;21m of the stolen &#163;53m recovered, did Northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with the UK and where a number of fugitives have fled in the past, hold the secret of much of the missing money and one of the missing suspects?<BR><BR>Kent police said yesterday they believe that Sean Lupton, the man they want to talk to in connection with the robbery, is hiding in Northern Cyprus. Lupton, a 46-year-old builder and amateur boxing coach from Whitstable, was questioned in connection with the robbery but never charged. He was last seen in December 2006 and his wife, Theresa, said yesterday that she believed her husband had been murdered. For years Northern Cyprus has had a reputation as a haven for ex-pat villains. But the local authorities and the island's British ex-pats are adamant that the image is exaggerated and say that if Lupton or the loot had been on Cyprus's northern coast they would know.<BR><BR>One man perhaps uniquely qualified to talk is Gary Robb, a former nightclub owner who skipped bail 10 years ago on drugs conspiracy charges and who is the subject of an Interpol red alert over a property deal.<BR><BR>"I came here because I knew I wouldn't get a fair trial in Britain," said Robb, 45, over a coffee in the bar of the Mercure hotel. "I explained to the government here that I wasn't guilty. It's a fantastic place to live. There's no violence and the police here are very respectful, nothing like the police in England. I've got young children and they love it here. It's very safe and you can literally leave your door open."<BR><BR>Robb, who numbers a couple of retired British policemen among his friends on the island, said he had seen other fugitives come and go. "I met Kenneth Noye [now jailed for life for murder] when he was here; he was in property development. Brian Wright, [nicknamed "the milkman" because he always delivered, now serving 30 years for drugs smuggling] was a very nice guy, too, he kept himself to himself. I know Asil Nadir [the Polly Peck tycoon, facing &#163;30m fraud and theft charges in the UK, now the publisher of English-language paper Cyprus Today]. He is very bitter about the way he was treated in Britain. He knows he wouldn't get a fair trial there either."<BR><BR>But Robb says there has been no sign of Lupton and, anyway, the banking arrangements are such that it would be very hard to launder so many millions, whether through property investment or the casinos.<BR><BR>The government of Northern Cyprus, which split from the Greek south after the Turkish invasion in 1974, says that neither the Securitas robbers nor their money would be welcome. Turgay Avci, the minister of foreign affairs, said that they were aware of the latest stories.<BR><BR>"The government is concerned that Northern Cyprus should not become a haven for criminals or their ill-gotten gains," he said. "For some time we have been cooperating willingly - and very effectively - with British and EU police forces to prevent just such an eventuality. As Northern Cyprus is not officially recognised by Britain no extradition treaty has been drawn up and signed."<BR><BR>Gill Fraser, editor of Cyprus Today, said the notion of Northern Cyprus being a bolt hole was "very exaggerated", not least because, with a population of 250,000, around 5,000 of whom are British ex-pats, it was hard for anyone to disappear.<BR><BR>"When we heard they were looking for people connected with the Securitas robbery here our first reaction was 'here we go again'," said Fraser. " One can't deny that there are some people here but they are very few and the government have sent people back and tried people here."<BR><BR>She cited cases of would-be fugitives who have ended up in jail, including Kemal Kemalzade, a Turkish-Cypriot, who fled Britain to escape manslaughter charges over the death in an arson attack of Colin Salt in Stoke.<BR><BR>As for laundering money through the 24 onshore and 14 offshore banks, the governor of the Central Bank, Ahmet Tugay, said that it would be impossible for the Securitas robbers. "We are very careful about who brings money in. There is no way that something like this could have happened."<BR><BR>Mustafa Guclu, who speaks for the prime minister's office, said local police had cooperated with the Kent police but no trace of Lupton had been found. "I would say to people in Britain - don't believe everything you hear. This is a democratic country and our legal system is like the British one. It's very easy for people to say 'we can't find the criminals; they must be in Northern Cyprus'."<BR></P>

<P>Monday February 4, 2008<BR><BR><STRONG>Terrorism bill opens way for secret inquests</STRONG><BR><BR>Vikram Dodd, crime correspondent<BR><BR>The government was yesterday criticised over plans to hold inquests without juries, which campaigners fear could limit hearings into the deaths of British soldiers and people shot by police. The plans are contained in the new counter-terrorism bill published last month and allow the home secretary to withhold intercept evidence from the families of the deceased in the interests of national security or the UK's relationship with another country or "otherwise in the public interest".<BR><BR>Although included in a bill to tackle the threat of terror, the new powers are not explicitly restricted to terrorism cases and could in theory be applied to deaths where no link with violent extremism is suspected. The provisions are designed to avoid the risk of sensitive information - such as details of secret service activities, phone-taps and surveillance - falling into the hands of randomly-chosen jurors. <BR>Privately, government officials say the new law covers only intercept evidence, but campaigners believe the power could be used more widely and effect inquests of British soldiers, the inquest into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, and other deaths at the hands of the police.<BR><BR>Helen Shaw, of Inquest, said: "We have serious concerns about these far reaching proposals, which have been introduced without consultation.<BR><BR>"The public will find it difficult to have confidence that these coroner-only inquests, with key evidence being suppressed, can independently investigate contentious deaths involving state agents."<BR><BR>The coroner and lawyers would have to be vetted and the inquest would take place in secret.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Law lords to rule whether decision to invade Iraq warrants inquiry<BR></STRONG><BR>. Mothers of dead soldiers take case to highest court<BR>. Outcome will determine reach of Human Rights Act<BR><BR>Clare Dyer, legal editor<BR><BR>Questions about the legality of Tony Blair's decision to join the US in invading Iraq will come under the spotlight before a rarely convened panel of nine law lords in Britain's highest court next week. Rose Gentle and Beverley Clarke, the mothers of two 19-year-old soldiers killed in Iraq, will ask the judges to order the government to set up an independent inquiry into whether it took sufficient steps to satisfy itself that the war was legal before launching the invasion in 2003.<BR><BR>The fact that nine law lords, instead of the usual five, are set to hear the case - brought against the prime minister, the defence secretary and the attorney general - underlines its constitutional importance. Nine judges sat in 2004 in the Belmarsh terror suspects' case on detention without charge, and in 2005 in the hunting ban case which challenged the legality of legislation passed under the Parliament Act.<BR><BR>The law lords will not be asked to decide whether the invasion of Iraq was lawful. But they are expected to look at the steps the government took in the run-up to the war to ensure that it was complying with international law.<BR><BR>Gentle and Clarke argue that they are entitled to an inquiry because article two of the European convention on human rights - incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act - guarantees the right to life.<BR><BR>They say this obliges the state to hold an investigation into whether the UK took reasonable steps to protect the soldiers' lives by not involving them in unlawful military operations.<BR><BR>The two mothers lost in the high court and in the court of appeal, where the judges ruled that the European convention was concerned only with domestic, not international, rights, and that there were some areas, such as waging war, which were matters for the executive, not the courts.<BR><BR>A key question for the law lords during the three-day hearing, which starts next Monday, is the extent to which, in the light of the Human Rights Act, there are still "forbidden areas" where the courts will not venture.<BR><BR>"Whether the invasion of Iraq was lawful is the most important unanswered question of this generation," said Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers, the mothers' solicitor. "The law lords will have to decide whether there are any questions of law that are out of bounds simply because, although potential or actual violations of human rights are involved, the context is a political one."<BR><BR>Fusilier Gordon Gentle, from Glasgow, had been in Iraq less than a week when he was killed by a roadside bomb in June 2004, after finishing his training in May. A coroner ruled he died because a "chaotic" military supply chain had left his vehicle without a vital piece of equipment.<BR><BR>Trooper David Clarke, from Stafford, died under friendly fire west of Basra. There was no separate inquest into his death because no mortal remains were found to be brought back to the UK. Lawyers for the government are expected to argue that military action is not a matter for the courts, and that a decision to deploy troops in a foreign conflict is not capable of being a breach of its obligation to protect life.<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Whitehall draws up new rules on language of terror</STRONG><BR><BR>Phrasebook designed to avoid blaming Muslims for extremism<BR><BR>Alan Travis, home affairs editor<BR><BR>A new counter-terrorism phrasebook has been drawn up within Whitehall to advise civil servants on how to talk to Muslim communities about the nature of the terror threat without implying they are specifically to blame. Reflecting the government's decision to abandon the "aggressive rhetoric" of the so-called war on terror, the guide tells civil servants not to use terms such as Islamist extremism or jihadi-fundamentalist but instead to refer to violent extremism and criminal murderers or thugs to avoid any implication that there is an explicit link between Islam and terrorism. </P>
<P>It warns those engaged in counter-terrorist work that talk of a struggle for values or a battle of ideas is often heard as a "confrontation/clash between civilisations/cultures". Instead it suggests that talking about the idea of shared values works much more effectively. The guide, which has been passed to the Guardian, is produced by a Home Office research, information and communications unit which was set up last summer to counter al-Qaida propaganda and win hearts and minds.<BR><BR>It shows that the government is adopting a new sophistication in its approach to counter-terrorism, based on the realisation that it must "avoid implying that specific communities are to blame" if it is to enable communities to challenge the ideas of violent extremists robustly. The new lexicon of terror surfaced briefly last month when the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, made a speech on counter-terrorism declaring violent extremism to be "anti-Islamic".<BR><BR>But the internal Home Office guide shows just how far a new official language, to use when talking about terrorism, is being developed.
