		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Sue Lynn Perry Smith shares her  Wednesday&#39;s Words of Widsom with us every first and third Wednesday of  the month.&#0160; You can pick up more tidbits from Sue Lynn&#39;s Facebook group,  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rodeo-Queens-Rule/201568706544538" target="_blank">Rodeo Queens Rule</a>.</em></span></p>
<p><em></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I always wondered why some folks are a furnace of ambition while others are quite satisfied to spend hours watching television and squeak by on a modest wage.&#0160; While there are several possible factors, including education level, socio-economic level, energy level and family environment, I think for many folks the answer lies somewhere in their ability to manage stress and perform under pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There may have been early life experiences that forged a certain relationship with stress. For instance, having to give a speech in front of a class may have proven to be too much for one child while the attention was gratifying for another child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Or, struggling to keep good grades may have created a mouthful of fever blisters and some hair loss for one child but created a sense of accomplishment for another child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I think these childhood responses to stress have much to do with choices made as an adult as to whether he or she will shy away from stressful situations or thrive in them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Consider that to hold a high stakes job, such as a doctor, nurse or pharmacist, not only requires the mental toughness to get through school but also the ability to work everyday knowing that a mistake could cost a life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Being a business owner is a highly stressful lifestyle too, from dealing with legal issues, to employee problems to customer satisfaction.&#0160; It is not for the faint of heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Conversely, I think some really talented folks shy away from the spotlight simply because they never conquered their fears and learned to manage stress. Or perhaps they mimic stress avoidance skills demonstrated by their parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I believe the ability to manage stress and perform under pressure has everything to do with a person’s likelihood of succeeding.&#0160; Yes, there are other factors, but I think you can have the education, the funding, the support, the energy and the opportunity and still fail if that ability to manage stress is not developed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So how does this notion of stress management relate to rodeo queens? I see a very direct relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One of my past titleholders, now a successful pharmacist, mentioned to me how easy her admission process seemed to be gaining entrance to the University of Tennessee College of Pharmacy.&#0160; My sister, too, is a graduate of UT Pharmacy, and testifies that it really is not easy to gain admission there due to the rigorous application and interview process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This former queen gave much of the credit for acceptance to UT and later her graduation to her year serving as Miss Rodeo Tennessee.&#0160; I think her words were “after my reign, I have developed a new threshold for stress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">During her reign she perfected skills on how to interview, how to prepare, how to perform, how to be independent, how to travel, how to be resourceful, how to solve problems and how to keep on smiling and serving well no matter what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In fact, several of my past Miss Rodeo Tennessee titleholders are highly successful today. In addition to the pharmacist mentioned, the list includes a registered nurse, a veterinarian, a domestic violence shelter coordinator, a couple of business professionals and a photographer operating her own studio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It’s all to their credit for pursuing a dream and getting the most out of that experience.&#0160; It’s no coincidence that many state and national titleholders carry their experience and developed skills right into their professional and family lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In a recent family discussion about our third generation of competitive horse showing, my nephew asked “why does our family show horses?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My answer was fairly simple. “You may not make a living in the horse business, but being competitive with horses or any sport will help you develop the mental skills you need to succeed in life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">“You are learning how to be disciplined and responsible. You are learning how to prepare and train for competition. You are learning how to handle both winning and defeat. You are learning how to handle stress, and this kind of stress is not too different from the kind of stress you will experience later in life. It’s just the stakes are usually higher as you get older.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">“Being able to manage your stress and perform under pressure will play a major role in your level of success as an adult.&#0160; Competing on horses gives you a place to develop those skills in a non-critical area of your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">“And the really cool part is that while most of your friends are learning these skills through the very commonplace outlets of baseball or football or soccer or basketball, you get to learn in a very unique and special environment – on horses!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">That’s why I believe competing in the arena or on stage or on a court or a field is such a great experience for young people, even if there is no realistic future as a professional athlete. The skill of managing stress and performing under pressure will be of great value in college, on the job and in every corner of adult life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My advice to goal setters -- don’t avoid stress. It is a natural part of any successful life. Just learn to manage it well.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some basic tips on managing stress</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Get moving and get your blood pumping every day.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Get a quality professional massage once monthly from a licensed massage therapist.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Eat a balanced diet and stay hydrated.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Get plenty of rest.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Take breaks during the workday, training day, or study day&#0160; -- a short walk will do.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Listen to relaxing music whenever you can.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Humor is a great tool for managing stress. Incorporate it into your day.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Be a person of your word.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Learn to say no to activities.&#0160; There are only so many hours in the day and one person can&#39;t do everything.<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Know you’re physical and mental limits – don’t cross that line.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you have difficulty with anxiety or depression, seek professional guidance.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Don’t tolerate feeling bad. Feeling strong and healthy is a priority.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Protect and build on key relationships with family and friends.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you are a spiritual person, absolutely make time for worship, prayer and meditation.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Forgiveness releases a lot of stress.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Avoid debt!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Be a conduit of love – give and receive.</span></li>
</ul>

She worked with the horse herself, now he is a finished out head horse for her and her grandfather to team rope with.&#0160; Kayla says that she loves the sport of rodeo because “it encompasses the values that she was raised with and lives by, which include strong family ideals, good moral standards, and the western way of life.” As the 2010 Miss Rodeo Range Riders Kayla will be entering the Miss Rodeo Texas pageant in June competing with ladies from all over the state of Texas for that coveted title and the opportunity to represent the sport of Rodeo and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.</span></p>

She is the daughter of Barbara Rupp and the-late Jerry Hackney. Growing up in western Kansas, Kara developed a passion for horses at a young age, and from that grew a passion for rodeo.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Competing in rodeo pageants since she was eleven years old, Kara has held the titles of Plainville Rodeo Princess 2004, Ellis County Rodeo Princess 2004, Jayhawker Rodeo Princess 2006, Ellis County Rodeo Queen 2007, and Miss Teen Rodeo Kansas 2009. Promoting rodeo and the western way of life has become a true passion of hers. In the next few years, she hopes to earn the title of Miss Rodeo America and earn her PRCA card to be a ProRodeo photojournalist.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kara’s favorite places to be are on the back of a horse, behind a camera, and in the house of God. She hopes to compete in breakaway roping in the near future, but a busy schedule keeps her from practicing as much as she would like.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kara is currently attending Fort Hays State University and majoring in communication studies with an emphasis in journalism and minoring in agriculture. She has been on the Dean’s Honor Roll all through college, is a member of the rodeo club, where she holds the titles of journalist and photographer, and Christian Challenge. She also writes for the university’s newspaper. Kara has been chosen as a VIP Student Ambassador for the 2011-2012 school year, during which she will represent the student body at prestigious university events.</span></p>
<p>&#0160;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Kara has been saved in the name of Jesus and is proud to say she has a relationship with her Savior, never taking a blessed day or a moment with others for granted. She hopes to glorify God through all that she does and bring honor to His name. After all, she isn’t just an ambassador for rodeo, but first and foremost for God!</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sue Lynn Perry Smith shares her Wednesday&#39;s Words of Widsom with us every first and third Wednesday of the month.&#0160; You can pick up more tidbits from Sue Lynn&#39;s Facebook group, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rodeo-Queens-Rule/201568706544538" target="_blank">Rodeo Queens Rule</a>.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Something I’ve noticed over the years of producing and directing rodeo queen pageants, is that it’s fairly easy for me to spot the contestants that have significant experience in judged competition and those who do not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is apparent to me that those with judged competition experience are more comfortable and realistic about their goals and how to achieve them. Typically, they are better prepared mentally for any outcome; have a deeper appreciation for a win and are more likely to turn a loss into a learning experience and take it in stride onto the next contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I say that is due to a kind of “emotional muscle” that gets developed over time from competing – both successfully and unsuccessfully – in the judged arena, which can include horse shows, regular pageants, talent competitions, public speaking contests or anything in which the opinion of a judge or panel of judges determines the winner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am a strong proponent of judged competition. It yields a lot of benefit to young people trying to learn a craft or excel at a sport. But even more importantly, in my opinion, judged competition is an excellent training ground for life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Of course I think the most helpful kind of judged competition is the fair kind, in which the scoring system, the judge selection, the contestant draw and such things are all handled in a fair manner.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">However, I think there are great learning experiences to be had from unfair competition too. After all, life isn’t fair sometimes.&#0160; We should learn to navigate either scenario with grace and get a jump on achieving a successful personal and professional life as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So if you’ve only run against a clock in your competitive life or perhaps have no competitive experience at all, you may be at a disadvantage emotionally when competing against contestants from judged backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yes, I’ve seen first-time queen contestants with only trail riding experience win rodeo queen contests.&#0160; And, often those winners will not have the respect for the title as much as a fellow contestant who has entered three times and finally won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I’ve seen those first-time winners enter an additional contest later and not win. It turns into a huge reality check for them, and I’m always curious to see if she will learn from the experience and take it in stride or decide that “rodeo queening is just not for me,” which is code for “if I can’t win every time I’m just not going to enter anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I judge a rodeo queen pageant, I’m always curious to know which contestants have entered more than one time. Typically, those are the contestants who really want the job, if they’re willing to learn from past failures and take it in stride onto the next goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">That is the kind of emotional muscle I look for in a rodeo queen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Of course, sometimes those ladies that enter two and three years in a row still can’t quite rise to the top, but they always get my attention and respect for continuing to try hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Learning that every judged competition is determined by the opinion of a person or panel is key. You asked for that opinion by entering the contest. So you can’t really complain about that opinion. Just remember, the next contest will have a different judge or panel of judges with different opinions and probably a different outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Entering a judged competition takes tremendous courage. Give yourself more than one chance to realize your goals, if they’re really important to you, that is, and all the while you&#39;ll be gaining a wealth of experience and building your emotional muscle.<br /></span></p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="http://www.rodeoroyalty.com/rodeoroyaltycom/2011/05/wednesday-words-of-wisdom.html">Wednesday's Words of  Widsom ~ Don't Leave Any Points at the Trailer</a></h3>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The saying “don’t leave any points at the trailer” has become a friendly family slogan that began several years ago, when my young nephews Jonathan and Stephen Timberlake were learning to show their horses in reining and horsemanship classes at the Saturday night circuit shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Practically every Saturday night during the hot humid summers in Arkansas, the boys would invariably ask if it was necessary to wear their chaps in the show ring. Being the self appointed “director of appearance” for Team Timberlake, I always said “yes you should wear your chaps because we don’t want to leave any points at the trailer.” To me, the chaps equated to possible points, unwritten or written, by the judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The same logic was used when the show team didn’t want to take the time to weave in the tail extension, or paint the hooves, or apply the Show Sheen, or wear the freshly pressed shirt, or clean the saddle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">My view is that if you have a can of Pepi spray in the trailer, why not use it? If you spend the fuel money and a perfectly good Saturday afternoon to show, then do it right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In any judged situation, including horse shows and rodeo queening, you want to use all the tools and resources available to you to make a good impression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is a subconscious message being sent and received when a contestant enters the arena (or stage) that is very visual.&#0160; When the judge first lays eyes on the contestant, he or she makes an immediate assessment as to whether that contestant looks like he or she came to win or not. If the contestant looks serious about competing, then typically the judge will be serious about watching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Also, I think being fully turned out for the competition is a sign of respect for the event, the fellow contestants and the judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Most women know that there is no quicker way to establish your place in the competitive hierarchy than by your appearance. Of course, great appearance must be quickly followed up by great skill, or else the attention won by the nice appearance will be lost by the failure to perform well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">So if you’re going to compete in a judged event, strive for the best in every area. Why would you invest a lot of time and money in professional training and expensive clothes and then show up in dirty boots and unstyled hair with no lipstick on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Your appearance is something you have total control over. Why not go all the way with it?&#0160; You have a lot of control over your knowledge of the sport. Why not go to great lengths to study and learn everything you can about it? You have total control over the content and presentation of a speech. Why not prepare so that you could say that speech backwards while standing on your head?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Leave no stone unturned. Leave no resource untapped. Use every tool at your disposal. Have no regrets after a competition – know that you did your due diligence in preparing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Being relentless on preparation won’t guarantee a win but it will certainly increase your chances of winning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Today, my nephews don’t ask if they have to wear their chaps – they just do it. They always wear pressed shirts and put adhesive in their hats to keep them on during fast sliding stops. They do a good job of coordinating shirts, chaps, hats and blankets to look good together. And I don’t have to follow them with a groom bag anymore (much).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I have confidence the boys will do well in the appearance department as well as the performance department. So these days, I can just enjoy watching them compete and win. They’ve finally learned why we don’t leave points at the trailer.</span></p>

Located on the famous Las Vegas Strip at Tropicana Avenue, it  is at the center of the excitement of  the &quot;Strip&quot; and offers the widest variety of experiences on site and  within walking distance.

It will  also allow those people who come to Las Vegas only to see the WNFR to  attend the Miss Rodeo America Pageant.  While exact details of the  schedule are to be worked out, the official start of our pageant will be  on Saturday, December 3, culminating with our Coronation on the same  day the PRCA World Champions are announced Saturday, December 10th,  2011.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We hope you&#39;re as excited as we are about this great news!  There will be some work involved but we have never had our incredible  and devoted volunteers shy away from a new challenge. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A cowgirl at heart, BreeAnna’s love of the All-American sport began as a young girl as she helped her mother cool out one of her grandpa’s rodeo pick-up horses between the roughstock events. &#0160;As she grew up you could find her loping an old rope horse around barrels, following her grandmother around as she photographed rodeo action photos and cheering on her uncle as he rode broncs in the high school and college ranks. &#0160;She continues to cheer him on in professional rodeos and is proud to carry flags at rodeos and rough stock events.&#0160; You can also find BreeAnna pulling flank straps in the practice pen and working her three horses on the barrel pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">“Rodeo is not just a sport or an event in my family… it’s a way of life!&#0160;&#0160; My family and friends have provided me with the horses to help me achieve my goals, the guidance to build my skills and the support so that I can continue to climb the ladder.&#0160; It is because of these wonderful experiences that I have chosen to become a rodeo queen and support this great way of life. The skills I’ve learned from the great people involved in rodeo and the equine industry have helped me become a success in the arena of life and for that I am ever grateful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You can follow BreeAnna along her journey by becoming a fan of the Miss Junior Rodeo Idaho 2011<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Miss-Junior-Rodeo-Idaho-2011/150306355001619?v=wall#!/pages/Miss-Junior-Rodeo-Idaho-2011/150306355001619?v=wall" target="_blank"> Facebook page</a>.&#0160; BreeAnna&#39;s photo is courtsey of <a href="http://www.caywoodphotography.com/" target="_blank">Joyce Caywood Photography</a>.</span></p>
