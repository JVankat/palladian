                            <p><strong>The announcement the day before this Lords test match of the retirement of England’s number one all rounder has left many commentators wondering why the decision was taken to announce it on the eve of one of England’s most important test match of the year.   Tom Maxwell gives us his take…</strong></p>
<p>There is no doubt after this series there will be a large Andrew Flintoff shaped whole not only in the England team but in the hearts of all England cricket fans who have adored watching him take on the best players in the world head on with the three lions strapped to his chest. His obvious love of the game and the enjoyment he seems to get from it has rubbed off on anyone who has ever watched him whether it be in the ground or on a television screen and he has often brought a smile to the face of even the most hardened England fan. Who can forget that cheeky sledge to Tino Best at Lords in 2004 when he tempted him to ‘clean the windows’ of the media centre with a big six. A couple of balls later Tino in his ultimate wisdom took on the challenge and lost, leaving big Fred and the whole country in a fit of laughter.</p>
<p>Five years on from that moment and much has happened in the career of arguably England’s most inspirational cricketer since Ian Botham. He played the major role in bringing the Ashes home in 2005, he had a go at captaincy and has also suffered a number of critical injuries that have kept him out of crucial matches. So how will England deal with no Flintoff, a man who takes crucial wickets, can score big runs very quickly from either number 6 or 7 and is by far our best slip catcher.</p>
<p>In truth thought there are many who believe England to be a better and better rounded outfit without Flintoff in the side. Since the Ashes in 2005 England have played 48 test matches of which Flintoff has played 23 and only be part of a winning side on 3 occasions. In the 25 games that Flintoff has missed England have won 12 and only lost 3 which is an exceptional record by anyone’s standards. With this record in mind perhaps it will not affect the England team as much as they think, presumably England would play an extra batsmen (hopefully one can field at slip) and have four specialist bowlers, with Prior moving back to number 7. The other option would be, and this relies quite heavily on Broad turning into a decent enough batsmen to fill a number 7 spot and Swann to continue to impress at 8, to add a fourth bowler and have Prior at 6, a position he has proved he is more than capable of filling.</p>
<p>As for the series at hand, Flintoff will almost certainly be unable to play every test match. Like Pieterson he clearly has an injury problem and one feels that if it was any other series neither of them would be quite so keen to risk what is clearly a nasty niggle. They both have a huge part to play though and Flintoff may hold the key to England managing to take 20 wickets over five days, something that never looked likely in Cardiff, even after Flintoff had once again got the crowd on their feet by steaming in to remove the new Australian golden boy, Phil Hughes. His ability to bowl at left handers from both over and around the wicket will be critical if England are to turn good positions (like they find themselves in on the first morning at Lords) into victories. </p>
<p>Flintoff’s career record does not mirror the influence and inspiration he has had on the England team over the past 10 or so years. He will never be thought of in the same league as Botham, and rightly so just look at his averages (31 with the bat, 32 with the ball), but he has had the same effect on fans, teammates and opposition as Sir Ian had and he has also led England to an Ashes victory. England fans will be desperate for him to do the same again in this series, he still has a huge part to play, but the future of cricket in this country is in good hands with a good group of young players and Flintoff’s retirement will not be the end of that.</p>

                           <h2><a href="http://predicts.betfair.com/?p=2922" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Ashes Predictions: Lords second test preview">The Ashes Predictions: Lords second test preview</a></h2> 

						   

                            <p><strong>Betfair Predicts&#8217; cricket enthusiast, Tom Maxwell, gives us his take ahead of the second test from Lords on Thursday&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The Ashes’ fire is well and truly stoked and Lords is ready to host yet another crucial test match. England, having got away from Cardiff still level in the series, will be heading down to London buoyed by the grit and determination shown by a handful of players on Sunday evening. Australia will know that if they bat that well for the rest of the series they are likely to be flying home at the end of August with a small earn safely stowed in their hand luggage.</p>
<p>Freddy Flintoff’s injury worry will be at the forefront of Andrew Strauss’ mind as his team prepare for another stern test at a ground where they have the most dreadful of records against their most sworn enemy. The claim by Geoff Miller, England’s Chairman of Selectors, that Harmison would not have been in the squad but for Flintoff’s injury must be taken with a healthy pinch of salt, but it will give confidence to Graham Onions who will feel that he should rightfully be given the place as the extra seamer if, as we expect, Monty Panesar is not included at the Home of Cricket. </p>
<p>Ryan Sidebottom’s name has again be thrown around the media for a possible recall, mainly due to the thought that the Aussies may have a bit of a weakness facing left arm over the wicket bowlers, as Zaheer Khan’s record suggests. After the lack of success that England had with the Aussies’ supposed lack of ability to play the short ball in the last test, we surely have learnt that the only way to remove their top order is to ball with control and consistency and forget about trying to over bowl to these supposed weaknesses. Sidebottom should be considered, as should Hoggard, especially if Broad continues to struggle, but Harmison has got to be seriously considered if nothing else to give us something a bit different. He maybe inconsistent and infuriating to watch at times but he may also hold the key to unlocking some of the Australian’s top order who looked about as bothered by the English bowling in Cardiff as Michael Atherton is about his shirt/tie selection.</p>
<p>In the batting department England are going to need some considerably improved performances. Andy Flower in his post-match interview used the word ‘determination’ a number of times, and this needs to be heeded. The excitement of the first test, and the excessive nerves that England showed, need to be left in Wales and now they must show more control and patience in order to take England to a strong first innings position. They must not rely on their lower order, who will be severely weakened if Flintoff unable to play, and need to show the sort of mental strength shown by the much maligned Paul Collingwood this weekend if they are to post a big score.</p>
<p>Australia will really fancy their chances and are likely to go in with the same side, with Lee likely to still be unfit and Stuart Clark unlikely to take Nathan Hauritz’s place off the back of six wickets in Cardiff. They will know they totally outplayed England and will simply be disappointed not to have finished off the job. A strong defeat at Lords would leave England on the edge and thoughts of another series without a victory in the minds of all supporters, but a rousing display could set up another thrilling test match as long as the rain stay away and could set us up for another classic test series.</p>

                            <p><strong>Frank Gregan, writing on <a href="http://betting.betfair.com" >Betting@Betfair</a>, believes that the decision to stage the first Test of this summer&#8217;s Ashes series at the Swalec Stadium amounts to lunacy. However, the news that Brett Lee might miss the Cardiff Test, cheers our man up.</strong></p>
<p>The waiting is almost over - the event of the year is about to begin.  Like children waiting for Santa, <strong>the English cricketing public are now counting the hours down to the start of the Ashes series.</strong> Everything is in place and optimism is high in both camps, the only thing that just doesn&#8217;t feel right is the venue.  It&#8217;s a bit like the kids going to the movies rather than a pantomime at Christmas or visiting Scotland instead of Lapland.  It&#8217;s wrong!</p>
<p><strong>Lord&#8217;s</strong> should be the venue for the first test of an Ashes series and this move to Cardiff is daft.  The Ashes are steeped in tradition and with both nations considering it to be the pinnacle of test cricket, the first test match is worthy of much more salubrious surroundings than SWALEC Stadium.</p>
<p>It is of course the England and Wales cricket board and one must not forget the fantastic contribution made to English cricket in the past by the Welsh.  Players of the calibre of err&#8230;. There must be some Welshmen out there who has had a huge impact on the international game but at this juncture their names escape me!</p>
<p>Okay, there has been a few over the years who have won caps - <strong>Simon Jones</strong> and<strong> Robert Croft</strong> spring to mind and perhaps a few lesser lights but the Welsh have hardly contributed a production line of talent to the ECB.  The Welsh have produced legends in other sports but when it comes to cricket their cupboard is barer than Old Mother Hubburd&#8217;s in a recession!  There is a reason for this -<strong> the Welsh don´t like cricket</strong> - yet the ECB have been crackers enough to award them the first test!</p>
<p>This lunacy has not gone unnoticed in cricket legend land and there have been a few cutting comments aimed at the ECB. <strong> Shane Warne </strong>said: &#8220;The first Test match should always be at Lord&#8217;s. How Cardiff gets the first Test match in the Ashes is just a disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>You tell &#8216;em Warney, no sitting on the fence for our text sending convict cousin - in fairness it might be difficult to find a fence to take his weight!</p>
<p><strong>Michael Atherton</strong>, who is normally as disrespectful as a galley slave on his last warning, chipped in with: &#8220;It shows a complete lack of ambition that you&#8217;re putting an Ashes Test match in a ground that&#8217;s going to hold 12 or 15,000 people. It&#8217;s a joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Atherton got the capacity wrong, it is 16000 but the sentiment is correct - the decision stinks!</p>
<p>The news coming out of the Aussie camp is that <strong>Brett Lee could miss the first test </strong>with a rib injury and that coupled with the slightly better form shown by England during their warm up game has caused the Australians to drift in the<strong> Test Series Winner market</strong>.  Lee is a vital member of the Australian pace attack but they do have a like for like replacement (albeit with much less experience) in<strong> Ben Hilfenhaus</strong>.</p>
<p>The Aussies&#8217; current price is the biggest price they have been for months and represents amazing value.  I have lumped on the Aussies since the turn of the year and I&#8217;ll add a few bob more to the portfolio at that price.  When I collect I intend to treat myself to a trip to a cricket playing venue, Antigua, Barbados, Sydney or perhaps Johannesburg would be nice.  One thing is for sure -<strong> I´ll be giving Cardiff a miss</strong>!</p>

                            <p><strong>Injury worries, a negative captaincy and lack of mental toughness will ensure England lose the Ashes &#8230; again. So says Paul Moon, writing on <a href="http://betting.betfair.com" >Betting@Betfair</a></strong></p>
<p>Punters should set hype and statistics aside and acknowledge that there are <strong>three reasons why England will not win the 2009 Ashes series</strong> - injuries, captaincy and mental toughness.</p>
<p>Despite a fingers crossed approach regarding fitness there remain <strong>grave doubts</strong> about England&#8217;s two best players in <strong>Kevin Pietersen</strong> and <strong>Andrew Flintoff</strong>. It is unlikely that either will finish the Ashes!</p>
<p>Pietersen had admitted earlier that he might not be able to play in every Ashes Test because of his Achilles injury. He then did his best to allay concerns by declaring himself &#8220;practically fit&#8221;. Receiving perineural injections into the spinal nerve so as to reduce inflammation of the heel thus easing pain does not constitute fit of any description!</p>
<p>These sorts of injuries need rest and it is surely only a matter of time before it resurfaces which would sideline him for the rest of the series. Remember this type of steroid injection can only be administered twice. <strong>The chances of him playing in all matches are zero</strong> and with the Dutch debacle still firmly in the mind the likelihood of England competing without him vanishes.</p>
<p>Likewise <strong>there is absolutely no chance of Flintoff maintaining his fitness throughout a series</strong>. Pre-match/series planning should regard him merely as a bonus selection. Building a strategy around him accentuates the folly of reliance! He will contribute little.</p>
<p>Shorn of the boldness and firepower Pietersen and Flintoff bring England are left with a soft underbelly. This is compounded by the negative captaincy of <strong>Andrew Strauss</strong>. He lacks courage as was shown in the Caribbean earlier this year where he was solely responsible for the series defeat. Not only will he cut a negative and solitary figure it is not impossible that we will witness him buckle, especially after the Aussies target him. It could be that bad!</p>
<p>There is only one thing missing from Ricky Ponting&#8217;s resume and that&#8217;s being captain of a winning Ashes series in England. In 2005 he made a point of absorbing the full pain of defeat and the personal taunts he endured before vowing to win on English soil in 2009.</p>
<p>Preparation and focus is always key and the <strong>Australians have had a perfect lead up to the Ashes.</strong> They played three high pressure Test matches in South Africa (ranked two) and won while England beat a West Indian rabble (ranked seven) that demonstrated the worst excesses of attitude I have ever witnessed by a national team.</p>
<p>Their early exit from Twenty20 could be a blessing in disguise. They went to Leicester for a lockdown training camp where they spent time identifying areas of concern. They worked on their fitness and intensity and have now proclaimed themselves ready.</p>
<p>Australia are more determined and tougher individually and as a team. Their cohesive unit will expect to win while a fragmented England merely hope. The Aussies bowlers will hunt in a pack and are quite prepared to win ugly. These things remain alien (2005 apart) to the home nation.</p>
<p><strong>England do have an ace card in the quality of their spin bowlers</strong>. It is critical for their chances that they make this advantage pay dividends. They must strike early and win in Cardiff as you sense these Australians will get stronger the longer they&#8217;re on tour.</p>
<p>My hunch is that England will start well then fall away. English patriots would be advised to enjoy the first Test in Cardiff while we have our best players available, it could go downhill from there.</p>

                            <p><strong>They may not have replaced Shane Warne but Australia&#8217;s new generation are up to the task of defending the Ashes. And, with England finding their balance at the just the right time, this is destined to be a hotly contested series, writes Ryan ten Doeschate on <a href="http://betting.betfair.com/" >Betting@Betfair</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We resume our Championship promotion bid today and, while all my efforts will be focused on contributing to an Essex win, the cricket world will be focused on Cardiff for the start of what promises to be a fiercely-contested <strong>Ashes series.</strong></p>
<p>As ever, the build-up has been immense and both teams have managed their preparations well. The tourists are short of a few tried and tested Test stars (Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Adam Gilchrist) and this could explain why they&#8217;ve been less outspoken in their build-up than previous years. But the Aussies have found capable replacements in <strong>Mitchell Johnson, Brad Haddin</strong> and <strong>Stuart Clark</strong>and, as hard as I try, I find it difficult to separate the teams.</p>
<p>Cardiff was not necessarily a popular choice of venue for the opening Test but I believe the <strong>Swalec Stadium</strong> will pleasantly surprise its critics and, if the pitch plays true to form, it will favour England and hopefully set them off with a much-prized opening win.</p>
<p>For the most part, modern Test pitches are conducive to good stroke-making and fairly big scores. I&#8217;m sure Cardiff will match up accordingly. Glamorgan had points deducted for a poor pitch in May and I&#8217;m convinced the groundsman will take extra care to ensure a <strong>good wicket</strong>. Despite this, the wicket will turn and <strong>spin will be a factor</strong>. But I think reverse swing could have equal importance.</p>
<p>I think England have the Aussies covered in the spin department and the combination of <strong>Graeme Swann</strong>and <strong>Monty Panesar</strong> should deliver more than the likely trio of <strong>Simon Katich, Michael Clarke</strong> and <strong>Marcus North</strong>who, with no disrespect, are Test batsmen who bowl occasionally. Despite expert opinion I feel Australia will be forced to pick <strong>Nathan Hauritz</strong> who so far hasn&#8217;t looked a match-winner.</p>
<p>The seam attacks are evenly matched and for me they will represent the most exciting battle of the series. <strong>Brett Lee&#8217;s</strong> omission is a huge blow to the Aussies hopes of winning at Cardiff, particularly as he is a master of reverse swing. Johnson has been a revelation since arriving on the scene and <strong>Peter Siddle</strong> and <strong>Ben Hilfenhaus</strong>, although relatively inexperienced, have shown much promise against a strong South African line-up. Clark is a nagging bowler in the McGrath mould and will be a dangerous threat to England&#8217;s top order.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Flintoff&#8217;s</strong> return is as big a boost for England as Lee&#8217;s omission is a blow to Australia. <strong>Stuart Broad</strong> and <strong>James Anderson</strong> have both developed into quality Test bowlers and with <strong>Graham Onions</strong> and possibly <strong>Steve Harmison</strong> as backup I think England have the slight edge in this department too. Reverse swing could be a deciding factor as the series wears on, particularly if conditions remain as dry as it has been, so Lee could come into his own on returning from injury.</p>
<p>Both teams have strong batting line-ups and again there&#8217;s very little to separate between them. <strong>Phil Hughes</strong> dominated the Championship during his short stint at Middlesex but Steve Harmison may already have had a hand in this series by exposing Hughes&#8217; uneasiness to the short ball. Cardiff may not offer excessive pace and bounce but you can be sure that the England seam trio will test him out.</p>
<p>Despite his hat-trick of Test centuries, <strong>Ravi Bopara</strong> is the untried man in England&#8217;s line-up and, although he doesn&#8217;t mirror Hughes in his batting position, this could be the crucial batting match-up for the series. Rav is batting well and I&#8217;m excited about what he will produce over the next six weeks. In and amongst the established batsmen in their respective teams, one of these two could stand out and make a mark on Ashes history.</p>
<p>So while I find it difficult to separate the teams on paper I think <strong>Cardiff&#8217;s tendency to offer turn will give England the edge in the First Test.</strong> The weather forecast looks decent and I expect a run feast over the first few days. Let&#8217;s hope that England can exploit the small margins that separate the teams and that 2009 can live up to all the expectations.</p>

                           <h2><a href="http://predicts.betfair.com/?p=2899" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Ashes Predictions: From Cardiff to Kennington, a guide to the five Ashes venues">Ashes Predictions: From Cardiff to Kennington, a guide to the five Ashes venues</a></h2> 

						   

                            <p><strong>If you&#8217;re going to bet on cricket, you need to know your pitches. Andrew Hughes tells us what we can expect from the five Ashes venues this summer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sophia Gardens</strong></p>
<p>There is always a certain amount of mystery surrounding a new Test venue and punters and players alike have been trying to gauge how the Cardiff pitch will play. Its reputation as a slow, low turner was enhanced by the Friends Provident game there in May after which Glamorgan were docked points for producing a wicket that offered &#8216;excessive&#8217; turn. This fuelled the speculation that England might go with a two-spinner strategy.</p>
<p>However, we should bear in mind how important this occasion is for the Glamorgan authorities. If the ball started turning square from day one, it would be a public relations disaster for a venue that last year had to abandon a one day international due to faulty drainage. I think those considering lumping on a spin-loaded England to win the First Test at 4.2 might find that Sophia Gardens 2009 may not turn out to be quite as spin-friendly as everyone is expecting.</p>
<p><strong>Lord&#8217;s</strong></p>
<p>Since the drainage work of 2002-03, draws have been the fashion at the headquarters of cricket. Though there was a little extra bounce on display during the World Twenty20, this is a pitch that simply doesn&#8217;t deteriorate over the five days. Last minute watering to get some life into it may offer the bowlers something on the first morning. After that, it is ball-chasing time.</p>
<p>England haven&#8217;t beaten Australia at Lord&#8217;s since 1934 but perhaps of more relevance will be the question of how well Mitchell Johnson, Stuart Clark and Peter Siddle are able to adapt to the famous slope. Perhaps Glenn McGrath might be able to give them some pointers. Of the five venues, this is the one most likely to produce a stalemate.</p>
<p><strong>Edgbaston</strong></p>
<p>England have an excellent record at this Midlands venue, going back to 1902 when they skittled the Aussies for 36. Support for the home side is usually at its most raucous here and the players obviously enjoy playing in front of such a lively, committed audience who come to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>Edgbaston tends not to produce that many draws, though why this is remains something of a mystery. Although there is sometimes a hint of assistance for the spinners, it is essentially a good batting pitch and Warwickshire&#8217;s bowlers have toiled in vain on it so far this season, not helped by the lightning fast outfield. Perhaps the best hope of a result is through reverse swing as the pitch can get a little dusty.</p>
<p><strong>Headingley</strong></p>
<p>This venerable, slightly decrepit venue missed out on an Ashes Test last time round and so compensation awaits in 2009. Unfortunately, the build-up has been far from ideal, with delays to the relaying of the outfield causing complaints about unevenness from the Yorkshire bowlers and the embarrassing abandonment of a one day game against the West Indies when the drainage system failed.</p>
<p>Still, assuming that the outfield behaves itself, we can be fairly sure what we will get from Headingley. If there is cloud around, the ball swings, but the wicket itself is a fairly docile, batting-friendly one, although the lack of pace in it means that batsmen need to exercise patience. Full-pitched seam and swing bowling is the order of the day here. Fast bowlers will get nothing out of it and spinners may as well not turn up.</p>
<p><strong>The Oval</strong></p>
<p>At least the traditional finale to the Ashes has not been tampered with. The scene of some historic English triumphs, not least the 2005 series-clincher, it is a most un-English wicket. The hard surface offers plenty for fast bowlers prepared to bend their backs and also means that the ball comes through nicely onto the bat, favouring those players who like to play their strokes. Squint a little and you could be in Perth.</p>
<p>Yet whilst the likes of Johnson, Siddle and Lee may have the England batsmen hopping around here, the Oval also gives some encouragement to spinners and the extra bounce makes them that much more dangerous. It would be no surprise to see England pick two spinners for the final and possibly deciding game of the Ashes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Betfair Predicts&#8217; cricketer gives us his take on the key men this summer&#8230;</strong><br />
<strong><br />
England:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swann:</strong><br />
He has bowled so well this year and loves to bowl at left handers. Ponting and Clarke will give him a hard time but if he can tie down Hughes, Katich and Hussey England might have some real success. Don’t be surprised if Strauss brings him on early on the first morning in Cardiff if England are in the field.<br />
<strong><br />
Flintoff:</strong><br />
He has been in the press for all the wrong reasons this week but will be looking forward to getting back on the pitch to show England that he is totally ready for these Ashes. His bowling is going to be crucial, especially as he has had some great success against Ponting in the past and if the Aussie skipper struggles early on in the series then England might find themselves in a strong position going into tests 3 and 4. His batting has been poor in recent years but England will be hoping he can put together the same sort of partnerships with Matt Prior that he did with Geraint Jones in 2005 which took two tests away from Australia at crucial times. Flintoff doesn’t need to be in for long to cause a game to move in England’s direction.<br />
<strong><br />
Australia:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ponting: </strong><br />
The Australian captain will be hoping for an improved personal performance from 2005 and on the field will be expecting to lead his more inexperienced players from the front. He averages 56 in tests and will be hoping to add to his 37 test hundreds, England will be hoping to get him early when he tends to play across his front pad and is always a LBW culprit. If he gets in then England are going to get very bored of the sight of the Aussies skipper.</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong><br />
Brett Lee has had a difficult couple of years but against the Lions this week showed what he can do on a pitch that appears to be good for batting on. His bowling performance in the last Ashes was exceptional at times and he will be looking to, in partnership with Mitchell Johnson, lead the Aussie bowling attack which can at times look a little bit one dimensional with no front line spinner. His batting also impressed in 2005 when he batted for long periods and along with Johnson will look to frustrate England late in the Australian innings. He also has the ability to lift his side at any time with his athleticism and enthusiasm, it might be a defining series for the man from New South Wales.</p>

                            <p><strong>We are less than a week from the first test in Cardiff and England are enjoying a dominant performance against Warwickshire whilst watching the Aussies struggle with both bat and ball against the England Lions.</strong></p>
<p>Australia may have got to 358 in their first innings against a potent attack led by England hopefuls, Steve Harmison, Graham Onions and Tim Bresnan, but the majority of these runs were scored by two of their most experienced batsmen, Simon Katich and Mike Hussey. Australia will not want to rely solely on these two and Ricky Ponting to score all of their runs and will be looking particularly to vice-captain Michael Clarke (who really struggled in 2005 but has since started to fulfil his immense potential) and new superstar Phil Hughes. With no Andrew Symonds the middle order runs are expected to come from wicket keeper Brad Haddin and all rounder Marcus North. Neither of these two are particularly experienced and both have struggled for runs since arriving in England, this will be an area England will look to exploit. </p>
<p>An area Australia is particularly strong is their so called bowlers’ batting. Both Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson supply useful runs, with the later averaging over 30 in tests. England too have some good lower order batting, both Swann and Broad average over 30, but whether or not they will be able to deal with the pace and bounce of Australia’s fast bowlers is to be seen. The Australians will be severely hoping they do not sustain any injuries to their batters because the only other batsmen in their squad is the all rounder Shane Watson, who is also incredibly injury prone and this depth of squad in certainly an area that England will feel they have the upper hand in, injuries to senior players could leave Australia very short, where as England will feel that both Ian Bell and Owais Shah could come in and produce some good performances.</p>
<p>England’s worry when it comes to batting will be their middle order. At the top Strauss will need to perform to the levels he did in 2005 and Cook will need to continue his good form of the last month or so. Much will rest on the performances of Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pieterson  at 3 and 4 and then we are through to the middle order of Collingwood, Prior and Flintoff. This will be an area that the Australians will look to jump all over and if they can get Mitchell Johnson firing at these three, especially early on, 150 for 3 could quickly turn into 180 for 6 and England could be on the back foot rather quickly.</p>
<p>In the bowling department Australia will be pleased with their fast bowlers, Lee, Johnson and Clarke and going to cause problems to any batting in the world, and they have good back up through Siddle and Hifenhaus. Their issues (and this is not something that we have said about the Aussies for the past twenty years) is that they have not got a spinner that will scare England. This will be particularly important in Cardiff in the first test which is expected to take plenty of turn. Nathan Hauritz will be their front line spinner and has struggled to make any impact against the county sides in the warm up games, Marcus North and Michael Clarke both bowl a bit of part time spin but Australia will be hoping that they are not needed to bowl long spells and only bowl in short bursts to give their seamers a rest.</p>
<p>England’s bowling will possibly be the area that decides the Ashes of 2009. Broad and Anderson have both looked great this year but against the West Indies and New Zealand who are not a patch on Australia.  Graeme Swann is the top wicket-taker in test cricket this year, but particularly against the class of Ponting and Clarke, the latter being renowned as one of the best players of spin in the world, he may have to be very patient, and then there is Freddy. Flintoff has so much success four years ago, especially bowling at the left handers, and there will be plenty of them for him to get into, but is he fully fit and is he the same bowler he was four years ago? By the end of the first test these question will have been answered and we will have a better idea of whether this England bowling attack can take 20 wickets in every test this summer. </p>
<p>The final bowling place is still not decided upon. Panesar looks like he will get the nod in Cardiff, a spin friendly wicket, but Adil Rashid has put his name firmly in the selectors minds with a great bowling performance in the 20/20 World Cup and now runs for the Lions against the very attack England will be facing in Cardiff next week. It would be an incredibly bold move to put Rashid in, but imagine a lower order of Flintoff, Rashid, Broad, Swann and Anderson. </p>
<p>Lots of batting, but are there enough wickets. Speaking of wickets, Steve Harmison’s form for both the Lions and Durham will not have gone unnoticed and his success against the Aussies both in 2005 and this week for the Lions will put him in with a good chance of playing some part in the series. The other two bowlers who will be looking to take the extra spinners spot after Cardiff are Sidebottom, one of England’s  most consistent performer over the last few years, and Graham Onions, a man who took wickets on his England debut earlier this year and could be perfect for certain pitches, especially at Headingley, where the swing is usually prodigious.</p>
<p>All of these question will be answered over the next couple of months, but there is no doubt it is going to be another cracking series. The teams are so well matched and the pitches will suit both teams at different times. </p>
<p><strong>Likely starting line ups for Cardiff:</strong><br />
<em>England:</em> Strauss (C), Cook, Bopara, Pietersen, Collingwood, Flintoff, Prior (W), Broad, Swann, Anderson, Panesar</p>
<p><em>Australia:</em> Hughes, Katich, Ponting (C), M Clarke, M Hussey, North, Haddin (W), M Johnson, Lee, Hauritz, Clark</p>
<p><strong>Interesting bets:</strong><br />
Top England wicket taker: Panesar 18.0 (5% chance)<br />
Top Series bowler: Swann 10.5 (10% chance)<br />
Top Aussie Batsmen: Clarke 5.7 (18% chance)<br />
England to win the first test: 4.2 (24% chance)</p>

                            <p><strong>Frank Gregan, writing on <a href="http://betting.betfair.com" >Betting@Betfair</a>, looks at the different approaches England and Australia take in the lead-up to the start of the Ashes. Off the training ground that is.</strong></p>
<p>England and Australia share a common tongue but use it in two very different ways. The English are typically reserved, gracious and tolerant whilst the Australians are loud, obnoxious and in your face! Thirty per cent of Australians bait the English. Add alcohol and that figure rises to sixty per cent and throw in a discussion about cricket or rugby and you are in the high nineties! They are never slow to put the English down at any opportunity and they are certainly trying their very best to intimidate Ravi Bopara in the lead up to the Ashes.</p>
<p>Most pundits agree that a critical battle during the forthcoming series will be between Bopara and the rookie Australian batsman Phillip Hughes. Both are young and establishing themselves at Test level, both are considered outstanding prospects and during this series both have the chance to become national heroes. The winner of this individual battle could well determine the destination of the little urn.</p>
<p>The Australians realise this and have gone for Bopara&#8217;s jugular. It is an Australian trait, pressure is not built by building expectations, pressure is built by casting aspirations and issuing a challenge. Shane Warne is the latest to follow Mitchell Johnson&#8217;s lead and have a pop at Bopara, declaring that Bopara&#8217;s three test tons on the trot are not the basis of pedigree.</p>
<p>Warne said last week: &#8220;Bopara is a good first-class cricketer, but he is not an international cricketer, I think he has got all the talent in the world, but I just don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s got the temperament.&#8221; He can be put off his game too easily and he&#8217;s too worried about how he looks.&#8221; Meow! When Bopara read that his blood must have been boiling but that is exactly what Warne was trying to achieve, it&#8217;s the Aussie way, wind them up and watch them crack!</p>
<p>When asked to comment on Warne&#8217;s comments Bopara said &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to bat in the top order for my country. To do it against the best in the world will be a great challenge,&#8221; That&#8217;s the English way, polite and courteous on the outside, fuming away on the inside!</p>
<p>Phillip Hughes comes into this series with ringing endorsements from some of Australia&#8217;s finest. He has been compared to Steve Waugh by Justin Langer but probably the most significant comments have come from the former England fast bowler Angus Fraser, now the Director of Cricket at Middlesex which was where Hughes played earlier on in the season and had a great time scoring 574 runs at an average of 143.5! Fraser said, &#8220;It is an unfair comparison to make at this stage of his career but I feel he is a bit like Brian Lara.&#8221; No pressure there than! Quality - that&#8217;s the English way, respectful and complimentary but raising the expectation bar as high as it will go!</p>
<p>Only Ricky Ponting is shorter than Hughes in the top Aussie series bat market and the price available on the youngster is indicative of that expectation. Bopara has Strauss and Pietersen ahead of him in the English market but he is still too short to back.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the pressure is applied it will be there in bucket fulls for these two young batsmen as they walk to the crease for their first Ashes knock. The Aussies have given Bopara a verbal battering and the English are happy to let the expectation level surrounding Hughes rise and rise. It promises to be a great battle - I can&#8217;t wait!</p>

                            <p><strong>In series gone by, Shane Warne&#8217;s wizardry meant that pitches with turn in them favoured the Aussies. Not any more, says Ralph Ellis, writing on <a href="http://betting.betfair.com" >Betting@Betfair</a>, as England prepare to name two slow bowlers for the opening Ashes test&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>From the moment the schedule for this summer&#8217;s Ashes were announced, it seemed to make no sense at all to start the series in Cardiff. It&#8217;s England versus Australia, for heaven&#8217;s sakes, so why play in Wales? And why begin the most eagerly awaited contest in international cricket in a new and far flung venue?</p>
<p>But with a couple of weeks to go now, it&#8217;s starting to look as if there could be a little twist - or rather a spin - to that decision. The pitch at the SWALEC Stadium is showing signs of taking turn and ironically that could be a massive home advantage as the Aussies for the first time in years don&#8217;t have the beguiling, devastating bowling of Shane Warne to rely on.</p>
<p>England&#8217;s captain Andrew Strauss, in contrast, will have three slow bowlers in his squad and the signs are that two of them will play in the opening match. Graeme Swann&#8217;s inclusion was pretty much a given after his excellent winter, but between now and July 8, when the action begins for real, there&#8217;s a chance for cult hero Monty Panesar to return to the fold.</p>
<p>The Northants left-armer was the surprise inclusion yesterday when England&#8217;s National selector Geoff Miller announced the 16-man squad for the Ashes series, plus the team that will play Warwickshire at Edgbaston in a warm-up match next week. That looks very much like the favoured starting XI for the Ashes, and Panesar is in while Yorkshire&#8217;s emerging leg-spinner Adil Rashid is kept back in the England Lions side that will play Australia at Worcester.</p>
<p>On the face of it recalling Panesar is a huge gamble. Rashid showed promise in the Twenty20 games and has the huge advantage of being close to a genuine all-rounder because his batting is a major strength, while Monty could be most kindly described as a genuine number 11. Add to that the fact that after his dramatic introduction to international cricket, the Northants man has gradually lost his way, and has done little in the county game this year to justify his return with just six wickets to his name. But there&#8217;s a saying that form is temporary and class is permanent, and on that basis he could just emerge as an Ashes hero.</p>
<p>The thing about him is that, for all that his statistics this year don&#8217;t suggest it, he takes big wickets in big situations. He&#8217;s a bowler who has the magic ingredient of being able to break up big stands, and in Test cricket that counts. I&#8217;m even tempted to back him to be our top bowler in the series. And as for his batting, who cares? There&#8217;s too much attention paid to trying to get bits and pieces out of players when what you need is world class specialist performances.</p>
<p>England remain massive outsiders for the Ashes, currently on 27 percent, but curiously the Aussies are not such heavy favourites to start the campaign with a win. They are on 43 percent to be victorious in Cardiff, with England at 26 percent and the draw 32 percent.<br />
<strong><br />
Five things you might not know about Adil Rashid:</strong></p>
<p>1. Born in Bradford in 1988 he went to Heaton School - where they didn&#8217;t play cricket</p>
<p>2. He took up the game aged eight because his Pakistani born dad Abdul was a big fan, who bowled leg spin for a local club</p>
<p>3. He joined Yorkshire&#8217;s Academy as a batsman, but coach Terry Jenner encouraged him to develop his bowling and he quickly proved he was a natural.</p>
<p>4. He names his cricket heroes as Shane Warne and Tendulkar</p>
<p>5. He&#8217;s been recruited by Bradford&#8217;s health authority to front a campaign to help Asian taxi drivers in the city to stop smoking</p>
