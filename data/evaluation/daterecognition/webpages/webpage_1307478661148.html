				<p>
				Inti believes data is an asset that should be managed as diligently as any other business asset.
				Data management requires a different set of skills than software development - the resources are not interchangeable.
				Industry best practices provide a good starting point for any data solution, but are always customized to

				<p>Inti brings key skills for a successful business engagement: listening, collaborating, deep business knowledge, and

				<p>Successful data management projects cannot focus solely on the 'fun' stuff like
				database design and data profiling, projects need to address
				data archiving, physical data storage, data repository accessibility, reporting tools, access control, outstanding  
				data retrieval performance, privacy and compliance issues as well as documentation.  </p>
				<p>In addition to design, Inti can participate in the 
				development and implementation phases, proving the previous designs and recommendations.

    <h3><a name="DataAnalyses"></a>Data Analyses</h3>
    <p>Data Analyses are interesting in that they often discover/uncover data issues or reveal the cause/source of data issues.  Data Analyses often 
    involve rudimentary ETL and data quality rules, especially if there is heterogeneous data supplied from multiple sources.  </p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>

    <h3><a name="Feasibility"></a>Feasibility Studies</h3>
    <p>Feasibility Studies are an essential step in the early stages of projects, especially if vendor products are being compared.  This step needs 
    appropriate attention because it may support proceeding with the project or deferring.</p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>

    <h3><a name="ProjectPlan"></a>Project Planning</h3>
    <p>A successful project plan for a data management project
    is determined by the previous data management knowledge of the project manager (PM), 
    or a close working relationship among the PM, the Data Architect, and Data Steward, all key roles.</p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>

    <h3><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements Gathering</h3>
	<p>    This is likely the most important component of any project.  In Data Management projects, it is important for the business to articluate the impact
    of bad data, in different situations, and how they deal with it.  A "beginning of project" requirement of 90% data quality usually changes to
    100% when the business sees a report with an error.</p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>

    <h3><a name="Implementation"></a>Implementation Plans</h3>
    <p>Implementation Plans by nature are difficult to produce - but luckily the data related steps are usually fairly limited.  With input from the 
    key roles listed above, these steps can usually be itemized with good accuracy and can be integrated into a larger project plan.</p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>
	
    <h3><a name="VendorAnalyses"></a>Vendor Analyses</h3>
	<p>When a firm is comparing data management solutions from vendors, a template of criteria can be utilized, where each criteria has weightings 
    and each vendor has scores for each criteria.  Ideally the weights and scores should be numerical so that a calculated score can be produced.
    It is important, at the outset, to determine how close the ratings have to be when the differences are considering insignificant.</p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>

    <h3><a name="DataStandards"></a>Data Standards</h3>
    <p>Data Standards work usually involves determining underlying patterns from unstructured data (through empirical evidence or Data Council decisions).
    Data Standards go hand in hand with Data Quality efforts - once data is structured, it can be examined and measured.  Data Standards improve the
    meaning and usefulness of data. </p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>
	
    <h3><a name="BusinessProcesses"></a>Business Processes</h3>
	<p>A change in business Processes is almost always required in data management projects, usually for the purposes of collecting new data or improving
    data quality.  Understanding why business users do what they do is key, not expediency in implementing new processes.  </p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>
		
    <h3><a name="DatabaseDev"></a>Database Development</h3>
    <p>This is the physical side of data modeling and involves table, view, index, function and stored procedure development.  This is rewarding work 
    since it collects real data.  It is also reqarding because it proves the previous designs and recommendations.</p>
	<p><a href="#TopOfServices">[Top]</a></p>
	
    <h3><a name="RFPWriting"></a>RFP Writing</h3>
    <p>RFP (Request for Proposal) writing is an extnetion/variant on Requirements gathering and is usually completed by the same individuals.
    The difference is that legal is involved and senior management negotiates with the vendors.</p>

	<h3><a name="BMO"></a>BMO Nesbitt Burns</h3>
	<p>Inti 
	worked on implementing a fixed income trading system for Nesbitt Burns' Institutional Debt Group in Toronto. 
	Part of this effort was the design and implementation of a 
	data repository (on Sybase) for trade, price and position 
	data archiving, historical analysis, risk management and reporting. 
	A data transformation feed to Nesbitt Burns' clearing system 
	(ADP) was developed as well. Cross border trading with the 
	Nesbitt Burns' Chicago and New York offices was a key part 
	of the solution.</p>
	  <p>To 
	    support this project, Inti designed and developed 
	    a process monitor capable of tracking any process on any machine
