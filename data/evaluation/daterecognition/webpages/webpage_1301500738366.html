<h2>President Obama Speaks on the Situation in Egypt</h2>

<center><img src="http://blogs.state.gov/images/Dipnote/behind_the_scenes/2011_0201_obama_egypt_m.jpg" border="1" alt="Egyptians in Tahir Square watch broadcast of President Obama deliver remarks, Feb. 1, 2011. [AP]"></center><br>














  

  

  










  
<p><b>More:</b> <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_5257.html" title="Information for U.S. Citizens Currently in Egypt">Information for U.S. Citizens Currently in Egypt</a> | <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW1vgHE6FRM" title="Public Service Announcement">Public Service Announcement</a><br />
<br />
President Barack Obama spoke about the situation in Egypt on February 1, 2011.  The President said:<br />
<br />
"Good evening, everybody.  Over the past few days, the American people have watched the situation unfolding in Egypt.  We've seen enormous demonstrations by the Egyptian people.  We've borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country, and a long-time partner of the United States.<br />
<br />
"And my administration has been in close contact with our Egyptian counterparts and a broad range of the Egyptian people, as well as others across the region and across the globe.  And throughout this period, we've stood for a set of core principles.<br />
<br />
"First, we oppose violence.  And I want to commend the Egyptian military for the professionalism and patriotism that it has shown thus far in allowing peaceful protests while protecting the Egyptian people.  We've seen tanks covered with banners, and soldiers and protesters embracing in the streets.  And going forward, I urge the military to continue its efforts to help ensure that this time of change is peaceful.<br />
<br />
"Second, we stand for universal values, including the rights of the Egyptian people to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the freedom to access information.  Once more, we've seen the incredible potential for technology to empower citizens and the dignity of those who stand up for a better future.  And going forward, the United States will continue to stand up for democracy and the universal rights that all human beings deserve, in Egypt and around the world.<br />
<br />
"Third, we have spoken out on behalf of the need for change.  After his speech tonight, I spoke directly to President Mubarak.  He recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and that a change must take place.  Indeed, all of us who are privileged to serve in positions of political power do so at the will of our people.  Through thousands of years, Egypt has known many moments of transformation.  The voices of the Egyptian people tell us that this is one of those moments; this is one of those times.<br />
<br />
"Now, it is not the role of any other country to determine Egypt's leaders.  Only the Egyptian people can do that.  What is clear -- and what I indicated tonight to President Mubarak -- is my belief that an orderly transition must be meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now.<br />
<br />
"Furthermore, the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties.  It should lead to elections that are free and fair.  And it should result in a government that's not only grounded in democratic principles, but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people.<br />
<br />
"Throughout this process, the United States will continue to extend the hand of partnership and friendship to Egypt.  And we stand ready to provide any assistance that is necessary to help the Egyptian people as they manage the aftermath of these protests.<br />
<br />
"Over the last few days, the passion and the dignity that has been demonstrated by the people of Egypt has been an inspiration to people around the world, including here in the United States, and to all those who believe in the inevitability of human freedom. <br />
<br />
"To the people of Egypt, particularly the young people of Egypt, I want to be clear:  We hear your voices.  I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren.  And I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt.<br />
<br />
"There will be difficult days ahead.  Many questions about Egypt's future remain unanswered.  But I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers.  That truth can be seen in the sense of community in the streets.  It can be seen in the mothers and fathers embracing soldiers.  And it can be seen in the Egyptians who linked arms to protect the national museum -- a new generation protecting the treasures of antiquity; a human chain connecting a great and ancient civilization to the promise of a new day. Thank you very much."<br />

Mubarak's supporters and paid thugs are sending a clear message to the US administration today, they simply don't care what you are saying. This morning they started slaughtering hundreds of peaceful protesters in Liberation square.<br />
One of Mubarak's paid supporters was holding a sign that reads "SHUT UP OBAMA"</p>

Anderson Cooper Attacked & Beaten By Pro-Mubarak Clan in Egypt.<br />
<br />
Anderson Cooper and his crew were attacked by supporters of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo early Wednesday, according to the Huffington Post. CNN Coverage Manager Steve Brusk tweeted that Cooper was "was punched 10 times in the head as pro-Mubarak mob surrounded him and his crew trying to cover demonstration."<br />
<br />
Cooper was covering dueling demonstrations between pro-Mubarak supporters and those calling for the president to be removed from office when he and his crew came under attack. No major injuries were reported, and the anchor spoke to CNN's 'American Morning' early Wednesday about the attack. "My team were set upon by the crowd," Cooper said via telephone from a Cairo hotel. "There was no rhyme or reason to it -- it was just people looking for a fight, looking to make a point and punching us."<br />
<br />
"They at first started going for the cameras; they didn't want any pictures taken," Cooper said. "The crowd kept growing, kept throwing punches, kicks ... suddenly a young man would look at you and punch you in the face."<br />
<br />
CNN issued an update this morning indicating there were no serious injuries sustained during the attack. Cooper and his crew had been trying to steer clear of the protesters by remaining in a neutral zone between the two groups. But as the size of the crowd increased, the situation became less stable, resulting in violence between the two factions in the increasingly unstable country.<br />
<br />
"Anderson Cooper witnessed a huge crowd of Mubarak supporters surge across a no-man's land dividing them from the anti-Mubarak crowd and overturn a military vehicle on the street as a huge roar went up. A large cloud of smoke arose at the east entrance to Tahrir Square," CNN wrote. "Military vehicles were separating pro- and anti-Mubarak demonstrators, and several gasoline bombs had been tossed."<br />
<br />
Major anti-government protests began in Egypt on Jan. 25 -- the "Day of Anger," also National Police Day -- and have escalated in size and violence since. Millions have turned out to demand President Mubarak and his regime's immediate removal from office amid allegations of abuse of power and corruption within his administration. More recently, however, supporters of the president have turned out to stage counter protests that have become extremely violent, with the two sides attacking each other with stones, bottles and sticks and the Egyptian military forced to police the situation. <br />
<br />
IT IS A  LOUED AND CLEAR ANSWER FROM  MUBARK HE WONT DO ANY TRANSETION SOON. HE DID THIS.</p>

I would like to take a moment and say thank-you, for the phenomenal effort in keeping the information flowing through your dynamic blog. I've been busy finishing my thesis lately and like many people in academia, my world revolves around the international community and with ongoing international conflict. It is just so amazing to be able to read President Obama's speech on your blog given my schedule. The media only show's highlights of the speech.<br />
<br />
Despite all that is going on globally and the monumental efforts that are taking place in Egypt with the ongoing evacuation of U.S. citizens, I just wanted to say that your blog and untiring work ethic is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank-you</p>

The U.S. Administration should acknowledge that the immediate resignation of Mubarak, would be in the best interests for the Egyptian people and for the international community. We should view the change of leadership with Mubarak stepping down, as a enormous opportunity for democratic change in the region, representative by the will of the Egyptians. The Egyptian people are seeking an immediate change, they have a right to facilitate the process of forming an intern government up until full elections may be held.<br />
<br />
The recent political unrest expressed by the Egyptians, the wave of protests and the recent uprising by the people, should be viewed as a "teachable moment for the Obama administration".<br />
<br />
The people of Egypt, are exemplifying the process of democracy, they should decide and vote for their next leader and government. They are entitled in having their individual rights, civil liberties acknowledged and their voices heard, by engaging in a newly formulated democratic process. The international community should be closely consulting and listening to the EU member states and Turkey as to what should be next for Egypt after Mubarak resigns, not the Saudi Monarchy and King Abdullah, and not so much the Israelis, who are more concerned with the potential future changes for the political landscape in a future post Mubarak Egypt. Mubarak as Egypt's leader, should adhere to the will of Egyptians calling for his dismissal. The changes that occur in Egypt over the next few days is likely to impact the region and I foresee potentially, further uprisings in several other Arab nations: Yemen, Algeria, Jordan and Syria. We should welcome democratic change even if this results in a "domino affect impacting the region".<br />
<br />
President Obama, should just come out publicly and support the Egyptian people and the movement for a democratic change. Egypt, in particular Cairo, should have a special meaning for Obama, that is where he gave his important speech 18 months ago, addressing the Muslim world, steps away from Al Azhar University, where he spoke to the Muslim global community about favorable concepts regarding government, addressing "freedom, individual rights and democracy".<br />
 <br />
I foresee another massive demonstration scheduled for this Friday, which could result in being the decisive moment that the people have been seeking, Friday may very well be the day that Mubarak steps down?<br />
<br />
The sign held by one of the demonstrators at Tahrir Square over the week-end in Cairo, pretty much sums it up for Mubarak it reads: "Game Over".</p>
