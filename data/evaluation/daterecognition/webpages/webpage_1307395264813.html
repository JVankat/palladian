<p >INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — There was a sea of red-colored wristbands Thursday night at the Firefighters’ Indian River County Fair — and they stood for savings.</p>

<p >Patrons could ride all of the midway rides for the evening for $17, fair general manager Toby Turner said. Regular ride prices are $1 per ticket, with most adult rides costing four or five tickets each. </p>

<p >“FCAT’s are over and crowds are starting to come in,” said Turner. “We’re trying to provide the right atmosphere for people so they come out and bring their families.”</p>

<p >For the seven-member McKenzie family of Vero Beach, taking advantage of the wristband special saved between $50 and $75, mom Terri McKenzie guessed.</p>

<p >“We come every year, but it’s one-time only,” said McKenzie. “We’re not return visitors so we always make it a point to come on wristband night to save money.”</p>

<p >John Strates, co-owner of James E. Strates Shows, which provides the rides on the midway, said unlimited ride specials draw people out to the fair. “It brings the crowds up, definitely,” said Strates. “People are looking for a deal.”</p>

<p >George Weston, who manages the midway for Strates, said that the show tries to keep prices down in light of the area’s high unemployment rate.</p>

<p >“In good times, you do good, and in bad times, you try to hold down your costs,” said Weston. “We want to make it affordable for people to come out and enjoy the fair every year.”</p>

<p >Even long-time fair concessionaires are adapting their products to offer some lower cost items for families. At the apple dumpling booth, owners Mary and Don Shepherd, who have sold their pastry-covered apples with ice cream for 21 years, now offer smaller kid-sized ice cream cones for $2.</p>

<p >“When you bring your family to the fair, it can be expensive,” said Mary Shepherd. “So we offer a smaller cone that’s a little cheaper and families are so grateful.”</p>

<p >Shepherd said the Firefighters’ Indian River County Fair is still one of her favorite venues. “I never have any problems here and we’re treated so well, it’s almost like family,” said Shepherd. “The firefighters really do a fantastic job.”</p>

<p >At the ticket booth near the beginning of the midway, Shawn Landrum of Palm Bay paid $68 for wristbands so his four boys, ages 15, 13, 12 and 11, could enjoy the unlimited rides. That freed Landrum up to pursue his own reason for coming to fair — a sausage and pepper sandwich. “For me, it’s all about the food,” he said.</p>

<p >The fair, at the Indian River County Fairgrounds, 7955 58th Ave., ends Sunday. It is open today, 5-11 p.m.; Saturday, 1 p.m.-midnight; Sunday 1-10 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults; $3 for children 6-12 years old; children under 6 free. </p>
