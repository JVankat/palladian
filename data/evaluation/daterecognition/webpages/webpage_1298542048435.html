A conversation with two experts, moderated by Sheila Wheeler.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Attorney Robert Smith sets the stage. Mr. Smith describes in detail,
the elements of a negligence lawsuit, as well as the types of questions
that attorneys might pose to the defendant nurse. He also compares the
telephone triage encounter to the ED encounter. Mr. Smith shows how the
&ldquo;layers of protection&rdquo; approach to risk management can help protect
practitioners, while supporting improved practice. He warns of the
dangers of using UAPs and inadequate systems for telephone triage.
</p>
<p>
<br />
Laura Mahlmeister, PhD, RN, a legal expert, describes complex
clinical situations that can lead to risk exposure. Dr. Mahlmeister
highlights areas of unexpected risk for vulnerable patient populations,
revealing new access issues, inadequate policies and proposing safer
approaches. She touches on a myriad of legal issues surrounding
telephone triage, including the concept of &ldquo;exit strategy,&rdquo; the &ldquo;duty
to terrify,&rdquo; human error and nursing intuition.

<p>
<strong>Two Expert Views
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Can you elaborate on the issue of negligence as it relates to telephone triage?<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; One way to approach it is within the legal context of a
lawsuit. I think the starting point in this analysis should be that a
telephone triage lawsuit is the same as any other professional
negligence case. Of course, there are nuances between an obstetric
case, or an Emergency Room case, a nursing home case or a telephone
triage case. But in terms of a general overview, they&rsquo;re all
professional negligence cases. So whether a lawsuit arises out of a
call that went bad or care that went bad, the legal analysis is going
to be the same for all of those cases<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>ELEMENTS OF NEGLIGENCE</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; The elements of a negligence case are duty, breach of duty,
proximate cause and injury. So to have a lawsuit, you have to have a
duty owed by the nurse; a breach of duty or a deviation from the
standard of care. That&rsquo;s really where the negligence comes in. Did the
nurse who received the call breach the duty that&rsquo;s imposed by law? Has
s/he failed to follow reasonable steps? Did the breach of duty
proximately cause injury? There has to be injury in order for there to
be a lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
<br />
In a negligence case, we analyze those features. The issue that
comes up is that once the nurse accepts the call and begins to dispense
advice, then the law imposes a duty, even if there is no duty
otherwise. So in a typical setting where a call is received&mdash;for
example, a call center or a physician&rsquo;s office that has delegated the
responsibility to a nurse&mdash;there then is a duty. The duty, of course, is
to act in a reasonable fashion. In analyzing whether there is a breach
of duty, which is the heart of any negligence case, the question is:&nbsp;
did the nurse behave in a reasonably prudent fashion?
</p>
<p>
<br />
The definition of negligence will vary from state to state, but the
common thread is that the nurse has a duty to act in a reasonable,
careful or prudent fashion. Analyzing that in a telephone triage is
unlike almost any other setting. That is because the information is
being collected and dispensed over the phone rather than based on a
physical exam.
</p>
<p>
<br />
The analysis centers on what took place during the context of that
phone call, what information was given by the caller, what was recorded
by the nurse?&nbsp; It involves not only what information the patient
volunteered, but also what information the nurse elicited during the
course of the call. The analysis focuses on whether the appropriate
information was elicited.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, how did the nurse analyze, apply
or use that information? 
</p>
<p>
<br />
The issue of the nurse&rsquo;s procedure calls into question whether or not
the particular call center had protocols that the nurse was
following&mdash;written or electronic protocols or any other form of
protocols or guidelines. In a sophisticated telephone triage setting,
one might expect to see some algorithm or protocols. So the attorney is
going to ask:&nbsp; What information did you receive? Have you documented
it? What information did you elicit? What questions did you ask to try
to decipher what the particular problem was and the urgency of the
problem? How did you apply the information? What particular protocols
did you use? Did you document the protocol you used?
</p>
<p>
<br />
A good lawyer is going to ask:&nbsp; Are the protocols sound? What
protocols were applied? Did they make sense in this particular case?
Was the nurse using the right ones? Are the protocols reasonable? ?
(See Box A) Are they literature-based or research-based? Ultimately,
what advice was dispensed and what instructions were given? Was there a
sense of urgency, and were there follow-up instructions?
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>BOX A:&nbsp; Reasonably Safe Protocols</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
In many areas of
the country, nurses perform telephone triage without any protocols or
guidelines at all. In other areas, software companies have created
powerful, sophisticated, electronic software programs to assist the
nurse in the process of triage. Whether in paper or electronic format,
these tools are now considered decision support systems.
</p>
<p>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As technology has surged forward, many authorities assume that
these guidelines are reasonably safe and user friendly. Thus, the issue
of protocol standards remains essentially unexamined. New research
hints that protocols may provide a false sense of security (Brillman et
al., 1999), but more research is needed.&nbsp; From a legal perspective, the
lack of research combined with the fact that we are using newly created
tools may represent a looming risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are existing protocols
(electronic or paper-based) reasonably safe decision support tools?&nbsp;&nbsp;
How do we measure that safety? Could they contribute to error in some
way?
</p>
<p>
<br />
Standards for decision support tools are beginning to emerge,
partly in response to the Institutes of Medicine&rsquo;s (IOM) research on
Human Error in Medicine (1999). In general, minimum standards might
require that telephone triage protocols be comprehensive and
&ldquo;system-based&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
<br />
Comprehensive protocols would be defined as those that address the
most commonly encountered emergent, urgent and routine level symptoms
and conditions.&nbsp; System-based protocols should have integrated
components that work together:&nbsp; documentation form, &ldquo;exit strategy&rdquo;,
training program, standards and QA tools. The protocols are but one
element of that system. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<br />
Essential to the system would be an integrated documentation form
that complements the protocols and facilitates thorough documentation.
It should enhance risk management through &quot;forcing functions,&rdquo;
requiring users to elicit and document key required information. <br />
Protocols and policies (standards) should provide for a &ldquo;fall-back&rdquo;
protocol or exit strategy.&nbsp; This strategy is designed to support nurses
in cases where they find themselves having an &rdquo;out-of-protocol
experience&rdquo; (in industry parlance), or when existing protocols may not
apply.<br />
Specialized training should address how to properly operate &ldquo;the
system&rdquo; and the documentation form, whether in paper or electronic
format.&nbsp; It should include standards and directives for &ldquo;exit
strategies&rdquo; and a complete understanding of the overall design and
assumptions. In the case of electronic protocols, training in the
operation of the software (a technical skill) does not take the place
of training in the proper use of an electronic decision support system
for telepractice (a critical thinking skill).
</p>
<p>
<br />
In 1996, Farnsworth and Mariani set forth a set of criteria for
decision support technologies.&nbsp; Listed below are their basic criteria,
applied to telephone triage protocols:<br />
<br />
1) Validity - if followed, it will lead to expected outcomes (a reasonable, safe disposition). <br />
2) Reliability/reproducibility - given the same data, another set of nurses would arrive at the same dispositions.<br />
3) Clinical applicability - the protocols explicitly state the populations to which they apply.<br />
4) Flexibility &ndash; the User&rsquo;s Guide contains complete operating
instructions, explaining underlying assumptions and exceptions to
recommendations, in other words, &ldquo;Exit strategies&rdquo;.<br />
5) Clarity -- the protocols are written in unambiguous language, using
precisely defined terms in an easy to follow mode of presentation. In
other words, are they &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF NURSING QUALIFICATIONS AND THE DECISIONMAKING PROCESS</strong><br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; During a trial, the jury is instructed that a nurse has the
duty to possess and apply the knowledge and utilize the skill and care
ordinarily used by a reasonably well-qualified nurse. So, in that
context, the skills, the training, the knowledge of the nurse, or
whoever takes the call, is central.
</p>
<p>
<br />
There will be questions about the nurse&rsquo;s qualifications and
experience. So, as a starting point:&nbsp; Who took the call? Was it a
receptionist? Was it an RN? Was it an LPN? There will be questions
regarding the level of experience within a telephone triage setting:&nbsp;
How many calls have they handled? Have they handled calls similar to
this? Did they appropriately apply the protocols? Were they well
trained? All those kind of peripheral issues that would go to the heart
of whether somebody has behaved in a reasonable fashion.
</p>
<p>
<br />
The lawyer will ask questions about the nurse&rsquo;s educational
background, professional experience, about any training programs at
their place of work, their experience in taking calls. That&rsquo;s relevant
in telephone triage.
</p>
<p>
<br />
They will be asked:&nbsp; What kind of advice did they give? Was it to
go immediately to the Emergency Room? If so, did they orchestrate that
or facilitate the transport to the Emergency Room? Did they call the
Emergency Room ahead of time? If it was a referral the next day to an
MD, did they supply the number? Did they verify that that had taken
place? Did they verify that the instructions were heard and understood,
which of course, are two different things.&nbsp; Or did they just say,&nbsp;
&ldquo;follow up&rdquo;? 
</p>
<p>
<br />
The lawyer may ask about follow-up calls. Was there a callback that
day, or the next day? Was there a system for callbacks? I know that in
some sophisticated telephone triage call centers, there may be policies
regarding follow-up calls and callbacks. I believe that this process is
one of the best things that you could do&mdash;a policy or procedure to do
follow-up calls. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
Then the lawyer might ask: Was the nurse free to apply his/her
professional judgment per the protocols in making a particular
decision? Did any economic factors influence her decision? Is there
somebody the nurse can turn to when in doubt? In a telephone triage
setting, beyond the protocols, the nurse should be able to access
additional information or resources&mdash;a physician, a charge nurse or
whatever, if in doubt or if in question.
</p>
<p>
<strong><br />
<br />
COMPARISON OF TELEPHONE TRIAGE TO ED ENCOUNTER</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; The telephone triage cases are probably most similar to the
cases we see in Emergency Room settings. In the Emergency Room setting,
we see cases in which patients present, a history is taken, an exam is
done, testing is done and then a decision is made. That decision is to
either admit the patient to the hospital or discharge them. And they
are discharged with follow-up instructions. That&rsquo;s very analogous in my
mind to the telephone triage encounter, where you&rsquo;re assessing the
patient&rsquo;s complaints, you&rsquo;re trying to make decisions about what&rsquo;s
going on with the patient, and then you&rsquo;re trying to make a decision
relative to how you&rsquo;re going to resolve the case, or whether the
patient needs to be seen immediately. <br />
The common thread in all of these cases is that lawsuits are
outcome-driven, bad outcome-driven. Every lawsuit springs from
something bad that happened. In telephone triage, there may be
thousands of calls, thousands of sound decisions made. Then there will
be a small number of calls in which a decision is made, presumably
based on good protocols, and yet something bad will happen, just like
in ED settings. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
For example, in the ED somebody presents with chest pain, an assessment
is made, an EKG is done; chest x-ray is done; blood test is done;
patient is sent home; patient has a myocardial infarction and dies. The
lawsuit will center on questions such as:&nbsp; Did we assess the patient
correctly? Did we run the proper tests? Should we have admitted the
patient? In similar fashion, the call comes in; the patient has a
particular complaint; you assess the patient&rsquo;s history; you gather the
information; you ask the right questions. you apply the protocol; you
tell the patient to follow up with his or her physician the next day.
In the interim, something bad happens and a lawsuit will result. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><br />
<br />
INCREASING RISK, INCREASING LAWSUITS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; In your experience, have lawsuits related to telephone triage increased over the last 12 to 15 years?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; I find that because of the high volume in many of the
obstetric units, the doctors or midwives are increasingly advising
women to call in advance before they walk into a Labor and Delivery. I
meet nurses who have backgrounds other than obstetrics, who are
experiencing claims of negligence related to telephone advice, both in
formal call centers and in physicians&rsquo; offices. Because there are more
phone encounters due to higher call volume, there are more lawsuits
that involve claims that the initial contact involved a negligent phone
encounter, or negligent disposition of the patient&rsquo;s problem.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; I practice in Cook County, which is in Chicago. It&rsquo;s a
vibrant jurisdiction, lots of lawsuits, big damages. In terms of jury
awards, it&rsquo;s the second-highest jurisdiction in the United States.&nbsp; In
the last 10 or 15 years, we have seen a couple of major developments in
relation to all professional malpractice suits, including telephone
triage suits.<br />
Statistically, the risk of going to trial is low. However, the most
dramatic change over the last 10 or 15 years has been that
multi-million-dollar verdicts are far more common today than they were
years ago&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s telephone triage, or an Emergency Room case, or
an obstetrical case.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Talk about why that is.<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; There are a variety of theories about why that&rsquo;s the case.
Part of it is the theory that as technology has gotten better,
expectations have risen. People expect perfection&mdash;everyone expects that
they&rsquo;ll have a baby with Apgar scores of 9 and 9; nobody expects that
their child will be born with cerebral palsy, or brachioplexus
injuries, or with any number of other deformities. Even though there
are risks associated with surgery, everyone expects surgery to go
perfectly.
</p>
<p>
<br />
Some people think that the value of cases has gone up because we
now have multi-million-dollar salaries for baseball players and movie
stars. Whereas 10 years ago, a million dollars sounded like a bucket
load of money; today it doesn&rsquo;t quite have the impact or the power that
it used to have. So as verdicts go up, and the risks for defendants go
up, the settlement values go up, and, of course, it&rsquo;s no different for
telephone triage cases.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>INDIVIDUAL, VICARIOUS AND CORPORATE LIABILITY</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; My understanding is that vicarious liability comes into
play when an employee in a physician&rsquo;s office makes an error in
telephone triage and the physician is held responsible. Is that the
meaning of vicarious liability?
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Vicarious liability is a general principle of law,
which says that some person is responsible for, or liable for, the acts
of others who are considered subordinate. Vicarious liability is the
umbrella term. There is always an issue for the physician or
corporation in terms of vicarious liability, if you are hired by them
to provide telephone triage. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
So, if the individual is an employee of the physician&mdash;the midwife, an
advanced practice nurse, an RN, LVN or LPN, or an unlicensed office
worker &ndash; they are always considered under the control of and working
under the authority of the physician.
</p>
<p>
<br />
Separate from that, if you are a licensed professional, either an
ANP or an RN&mdash;you are licensed and authorized to do telephone triage,
and you may be independently accountable as well.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Does vicarious liability relate to the failure to provide such things as protocols, documentation, and training?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Yes it does.<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; What about corporate liability?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Corporate liability is a component of vicarious
liability. So, in that case, corporate headquarters is accountable for
the training and the supervision of people who they hire either
directly or indirectly within the health network to do telephone triage.<br />
<br />
Managed Care and Access
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; It sounds as if you consider managed care to be a major force
in this new trend, in that it&rsquo;s creating a higher volume. Would you say
that access is more difficult now, as a result? <br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; What happens is that patients who might have ordinarily
called the office to make an appointment now end up talking first to an
advice nurse, due to managed care, and that evolves into claims
regarding negligence. In general, those types of advice systems work
well. But once you encourage patients to call the advice nurse first,
you&rsquo;re going to have more claims related to telephone advice.
</p>
<p>
<strong><br />
<br />
ECONOMIC INCENTIVES DELAY ACCESS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; In 1993, there were no electronic protocols, and managed
care was relatively new. I don&rsquo;t remember this issue of delay and
denial of care being on the radar screen. What is the relevance to
telephone triage nurses?<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; Ten or fifteen years ago that issue almost never surfaced; it&rsquo;s
crept into some recent cases relative to HMOs and PPOs. It focuses on
whether there was an economic incentive. Again, the law varies widely
from state to state, but for delay or denial of care to be an issue in
telephone triage, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the denial or
delay of care was influenced by economic decisions. Then it would be
relevant and it could have disastrous consequences, but it&rsquo;s fairly
difficult to demonstrate. <br />
So, for example, if a telephone triage nurse is told that there will be
a surcharge if too many patients are referred to the hospital, or if
there&rsquo;s any economic incentive that can be demonstrated that alters
professional decision-making, that would be a serious issue. It is a
serious area of liability for the nurse and for the organization
dictating, controlling or imposing those criteria upon the nurse. The
nurse really has to say, &ldquo;I assessed the patient and applied the
protocol regardless of any economic pressures.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Again, one of the goals of telephone triage is to
reduce inappropriate office and ED visits in order to control costs.
And in the best sense of this practice, that is reasonable. However, if
a patient demands to be seen and is refused an appointment or delayed
in some way, there is always a question raised, about whether that
refusal or failure to direct the patient to an ED or timely office
appointment, was motivated by a higher concern for cost savings in the
system. <br />
Interestingly, within larger healthcare systems, there is a trend
toward the development of urgent care centers, to provide options other
than an Emergency Room. I believe this trend is the result of having
been hit with denial-of-care claims; patients have been told not to
come in, that the Emergency Room is inappropriate, and that there are
no routine office appointments.
</p>
<p>
<br />
There is a second issue related to delay and denial of care. That
is denial of timely access to a specific specialty care in a system
where, for instance, a family practice primary care provider is seeing
a woman. She becomes pregnant and calls in for an appointment with an
obstetrician, for what she believes is an obstetric problem. The person
answering the phone tells her, &ldquo;You must first see your primary care
provider; you need to call and make an appointment. Your primary care
provider will determine if you need to be seen by your obstetrician.&rdquo;
An inordinate and inappropriate delay ensues before the patient can be
seen in the obstetrician&rsquo;s office, which is often in the same complex
or building!<br />
&nbsp;And so, there are new malpractice claims, arising from policies
designed to make the system more cost-efficient, in terms of services,
and effective in providing the most expeditious and timely care.
However, sending patients to their primary care provider is sometimes
neither timely nor appropriate.<br />
What I recommend is that a primary care provider, who sometimes sees
specialty patients&mdash;obstetric, pediatric or oncology patients, for
example&mdash;should develop a short list of complaints.&nbsp; That list would
immediately dictate a transfer of the call to the specialty provider,
so that the patient can be seen immediately. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
Let me give you some examples:&nbsp; a woman who is pregnant calls in and
says, &ldquo;I have chest pain, nausea, vomiting and a terrible headache, and
I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo; She has just described signs of
preeclampsia. You don&rsquo;t want to waste time having the primary provider
see that individual. Another example, from OB, is that there are so
many general complaints that could be wrongly assessed, as &ldquo;sinus
headaches,&rdquo; &ldquo;food poisoning&rdquo; and other minor conditions, but that are,
in fact, severe life-threatening conditions<br />
For an oncology patient, it might be someone who suddenly exhibits
certain signs and symptoms that indicate chemotherapy complications,
which can include pulmonary embolus.<br />
&nbsp;This short list of critical conditions would allow the person on the
telephone to say &ldquo;you need to see your specialty provider immediately&rdquo;
or &ldquo;you need to go to the ED immediately based on your complaints&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have patients who are also seeing a specialist, it means you
must have some kind of fall-back position because they cannot waste
time being seen by a family practice physician or a GP.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>RISK MANAGEMENT<br />
<br />
THE ROLE OF POLICIES AND POSITION STATEMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; What are the key sources of legal opinions regarding telephone triage?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; I would include specifically the Nurse Practice Act,
and the licensing board rules, regulations, advisories or position
statements. The reason is that we now know that many boards of
registered nursing have developed and promulgated position statements,
standards or rules about telephone triage. People should know that
position statements and opinions often bear the same force as law. The
Nursing board is authorized to create those documents so they form part
of our legal resources. <br />
Finally, once a protocol is developed and published, people then
utilize that protocol to illustrate the standard of care or as an
example of the standard of care. Published protocols, textbooks, and
even journal articles are huge resources that expert witnesses use to
establish the standard of care. In some states, the law now requires
that, before someone renders an opinion about the standard of care,
that they provide appropriate current literature supporting that
opinion, as well as any published standards or guidelines that
organizations put out.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS: LAYERS OF PROTECTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; I have been told in the past that if one ever had to
appear in court, it would be best if that person had this laundry
list:&nbsp; guidelines and protocols, documentation form, policies and
procedures that are dated, telephone triage training materials, a job
description and qualifications, and a quality improvement program.
Would you agree with that list and is there anything you would add to
it?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; I would agree. Generally what happens is that well before
the person gets to court, the attorney representing the plaintiff will
ask for all of those things from the telephone triage center or the
physician&rsquo;s office or the clinic, wherever the telephone triage
occurred. <br />
A plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney will ask for these things even when the incident
occurred in in-patient settings, where people answer the phone in a
very informal way. This is one of the big issues in cases involving
Labor and Delivery or Nursery. Many systems toss telephone triage into
the lap of nurses who work in Labor and Delivery or Nursery. They take
calls about newborn symptoms, pregnancy symptoms or post-partum
symptoms, but many times in a very informal way.<br />
If the organization cannot produce these risk management tools, then it
has a problem, because then the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney will assert that
the organization did not have the appropriate tools to offer safe
telephone triage and advice. If you can&rsquo;t produce those written or
electronic documents to validate that you have a systematic approach to
the process, you can&rsquo;t be viewed as reasonable or prudent as a
corporate entity.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; I always think of these elements as layers of protection.
You could have one of the ten, and you&rsquo;ve got one layer of protection,
but to really control risk, you need many layers of protection:&nbsp; people
who are well-trained, sound protocols, a quality management program.
It&rsquo;s sort of like concentric circles; you&rsquo;re building layers of
protection around yourself.<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Would you say that being able to produce all of these tools
is evidence of a given institution&rsquo;s attempt to provide infrastructure
or support to the nurse doing telephone triage; that it&rsquo;s a starting
place?&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t mean that she&rsquo;s necessarily done a good job with the
call, but at least all the components were there, right?
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Correct. In terms of the evolving nature of
healthcare today, we&rsquo;re moving towards what we call a high reliability
systematic approach to the provision of care. I will tell you that
telephone triage and advice is going to probably be the next frontier. <br />
In other words, they&rsquo;ve developed patient safety standards for
hospitals, ambulatory settings and ambulatory surgical settings. Next
they will be looking at specific recommendations for safety in
telephone triage. I think it will be the area of scrutiny for consumers
and advocates for patient safety in that regard.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp;&nbsp; As related to the standard of care, is there anything
you want to say about what is reasonable and prudent for a practitioner?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Whether it&rsquo;s a provider, advanced practice nurse, or a
registered nurse, what is reasonable and prudent practice is comprised
of the knowledge that they should possess to conduct telephone triage
appropriately and safely. It is possessing the skill, and it&rsquo;s a unique
skill, to conduct an interview and assessment, to develop a problem
list or to make a nursing diagnosis on the phone. So it&rsquo;s both
knowledge and skill.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>COMMUNITY STANDARDS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Community standards are an area of confusion. How does that concept relate to telephone triage?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; With legal reforms occurring state-by-state, there
are individual states now that do not recognize a national standard for
any area of practice. So, when I am in one of those states as an expert
witness, I am frequently asked what I understand to be the standard of
care. I say that, in this state, the standard of care is what &ldquo;a
reasonable and prudent nurse would do in a comparably sized community
in a comparable facility with the type of patient that s/he encountered
in this case.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t use a national standard. But I can say that,
while there are national published guidelines and standards for the act
in which the nurse was engaged, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect that patients in this
state should expect a lower standard of care.<br />
For instance, if a nurse was in a medium-sized semi-rural town, I could
not say that there needed to be an electronic protocols available or
that they needed to have certain types of resources.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not how
they do it there. However, I could say that they needed to provide
their staff with basic training and guidelines for answering the phone,
and instructions on how to deal with emergencies. I could also say that
there needed to be some type of quality review; the physician needed to
be able to identify misses and near-misses on the disposition of
problems, and that there needed to be oversight.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
<br />
I can talk about general principles, but I can&rsquo;t necessarily
produce any written national standards because none of the providers in
that community uses those resources. So, defining the standard of care
is problematic and may get more complex as every state develops
different ways of dealing with its own definition of the standard of
care.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; You seem to be saying that in a state that uses strictly
community standards there should at least be a bare-bones system in
place&mdash;something like a guideline, some kind of form, something related
to a policy, something related to training&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s very minimal;
there should be something in place that addresses the issue of standard
of care, correct?
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER&nbsp; Yes, when it comes to demonstrating a failure to
provide any standards, we have a strategy that demonstrates to a jury
the lack of even a bare-bones minimum systematic approach. We ask three
different people in the office to say how they would have answered the
call and what their disposition would be. Each will say something
different. And then we can say, &ldquo;Do you see how not having had a basic
training program, a basic set of guidelines, a list of problems, a
policy of how to contact the doctor&mdash;how all this resulted in chaos, and
why the patient fell through the cracks?&rdquo;<br />
How one establishes community standards is based on consensus among the
providers in that community.&nbsp; However, the citizens in that community,
and the patients who go to those local hospitals, should be able to
expect that there is still some type of uniform approach to telephone
triage. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>EMPLOYER RISK AVOIDANCE</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Do you have any recommendations for key steps an employer might do to avoid risk?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; First of all, the new HIPAA guidelines require a training
process for the process of how the individual answers the phone call,
and begins the process of triage. There are cases evolving every day
that involve accidental release of confidential information, or a
family member calls about a concern and information is shared
inappropriately.<br />
Secondly, there has to be some&mdash;again, you&rsquo;ve used the word and I&rsquo;ll use
it&mdash;bare-bones guidelines so that the person taking the telephone call
can identify potential or real emergencies and get that individual to
the appropriate level of care as quickly as possible. Finally, there
should be documentation of the process, so that should questions arise
later, one can open the patient&rsquo;s medical record and see what happened
and what was done about it. It never can be just word-of-mouth anymore;
it has to be a documented process.
</p>
<p>
<strong><br />
<br />
DIVIDING TASKS APPROPRIATELY: UAPs</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Should any unlicensed assistive personnel or LVN or LPN be handling symptom-based calls?<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; Absolutely not, and that&rsquo;s a slam-dunk. Absolutely,
unequivocally no. I would never advise any hospital, any call center,
any nurse, any employer to do this, because the employer&rsquo;s ultimately
going to be responsible. So if the employer thinks that they&rsquo;re going
to save a few dollars by employing clerical personnel, they&rsquo;ve just
bitten off more than they want.<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t this still a widespread practice? Aren&rsquo;t many doctors&rsquo;
offices using LPNs, LVNs and unlicensed assistive personnel to take
calls that should be handled by a RN?
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; Yes, unquestionably and especially with the shortage of
RNs. My sense of it is that offices vary widely in their practice; they
try to divide up what they perceive as clerical task&mdash;lab values,
follow-up appointments and given those calls to clerical personnel. But
we&rsquo;ve all seen cases where abnormal lab values have reported to the
patient as normal. It has implications beyond the lab value. <br />
If you told me you had clerical personnel calling patients for all the
normal values, I would tell you I&rsquo;m not too worried about it. If you
told me your clerical personnel are calling about all values, including
abnormal values, now I&rsquo;m worried, now I think it&rsquo;s more risk than you
want to take. And if you&rsquo;re talking about taking calls that are
symptom-based, then it&rsquo;s clearly inadequate to have unlicensed
personnel or LPNs rather than RNs.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Who is the best person to perform telephone triage?
Some physicians have told me that they&rsquo;ve trained their office staff
--right off the street -- with no credentials to do telephone triage.&nbsp;
They claim that they are better at triaging than the nurses. However,
they have to understand that there is a huge vicarious liability; it&rsquo;s
all on their shoulders. It is difficult to sue an office worker with a
high school diploma who you say is going to be competent and capable to
do triage. <br />
Secondly, in some states, the boards of nursing are writing specific
opinion statements, saying that an LVN or LPN cannot perform telephone
triage. Two states that do allow it are Texas and California.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>RIGHTFUL ROLE OF NURSE AND PROTOCOLS</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
MS WHEELER:&nbsp; What are your thoughts about guidelines versus protocol terminology?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Should we call it a standard or a protocol or
guideline? I don&rsquo;t care if you call it &ldquo; a nice to-do list&rdquo;&mdash;when they
project this &ldquo;nice to-do list&rdquo; on a large screen in front of a jury&mdash;and
you didn&rsquo;t do these &ldquo;nice things,&rdquo; there are going to be questions
asked, and you&rsquo;re going to be accountable for the answers.<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; There still seems to be a controversy in telephone triage
about whether paper or electronic protocols are decision-support of
decision-making tools. My opinion is that they are decision-support
tools and the bottom line is the trained, experienced nurse with good
common sense.<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Yes, protocols are only a support. Ultimately, you have
to factor in the decision-making skills:&nbsp; clinical judgment, common
sense, and what I call nursing intuition, for which there is scientific
evidence. Nursing intuition is a sense of &ldquo;knowing without articulating
it,&rdquo; that something is not right. Nurses develop that ability over
time. In fact, nurses have much more strongly developed clinical
intuitions than doctors do. Although there are some exceptions. <br />
For example, when you ask somebody what makes a good diagnostician,
it&rsquo;s the fact that they&rsquo;re tapped into their intuition, combined with
their clinical knowledge base, which makes them excellent
diagnosticians. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you are using paper protocols
or electronic decision trees, it is a support tool and the rest is the
clinical judgment, common sense, and nursing intuition that really
governs ultimately what the nurse does with that protocol.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Providing an Exit Strategy</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; So then, what effect does that have on the negligence
issue? In other words, if the bottom line is not the protocol but the
nurse&rsquo;s judgment, then it sounds like what you&rsquo;re saying is the
protocol can never be found to be at fault. Could there be an area of
risk to protocol developers as well?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp;&nbsp; The risk is not having an exit strategy. The same rule
holds for any kind of policy or procedure. Realize that nothing is ever
written in stone; there are always exceptions to the rules. Guidelines
are support tools. However, there must be an exit strategy that the
nurse can employ when it is obvious she cannot follow whatever
protocol, policy, algorithm, or decision tree she is using. Nurses
should be trained to use it, and policies should address it. There
needs to be an exit strategy with additional guidance, support, and
back-up information. <br />
So, okay don&rsquo;t follow that protocol; it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to follow
it. What is that office&rsquo;s or call center&rsquo;s policy? This is crucial&mdash;a
template for getting additional help when you can&rsquo;t follow the
guidelines<br />
On the other hand, you can&rsquo;t hold someone with absolute rigidity to an
algorithm, protocol, guideline or a policy. There will always be
exceptions to the rule. That&rsquo;s where clinical judgment and this
intuition come into play. But the nurse in the call center or in the
office does still need guidelines.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Developing a Continuous Quality Improvement Process</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Are there any new areas of risk in the field you&rsquo;d like to discuss?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; We are finding problems in large call centers related
to continuity. For example, patients will call nurses and tell them
&lsquo;the doctor has never called me back&rsquo;. The nurses know that according
to their protocol, with certain types of problems, the physician
provider has four hours to call back. There has to be a quality
improvement tool to document provider non-compliance or difficulties
with the protocols, for example. <br />
So we need to develop a variance report form, or an unusual occurrence
form, that nurses can use when they encounter problems with the system
or the process, to begin the process of evaluating and fixing it. There
needs to be a quality improvement tool where you can talk about
near-misses and variances. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Awareness of Staffing Issues</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you ever hear or have you ever read anything about safe staffing standards for telephone triage?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp;&nbsp; I often hear this magic number of about seven minutes a call.<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 7 to 10 minutes per call sounds reasonable to me as
well. That&rsquo;s around 48 to 60 calls per 8-hour shift. I wonder how often
nurses involved in these cases are placed in an untenable position of
having to answer more than 70 to 80 calls per shift. That&rsquo;s a huge
volume of calls, and it makes it very difficult for any human being to
conduct them safely and prudently.<br />
<br />
BOX B:&nbsp; What are Telephone Triage Staffing Standards?<br />
<br />
While there is no universally accepted standard for telephone triage
staffing, the American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing states:&nbsp;
&ldquo;Adequate numbers of competent telehealth nursing staff shall be
available to meet patient care needs. Staffing should be provided in
sufficient numbers to address the quantity, quality and complexity of
telehealth encounters.&rdquo; <br />
In concrete terms, what does this standard imply? It means that the
safe time frame for each call will vary with the population served:&nbsp;
with healthy, educated populations, the volume may be such that for
every 60 calls, one nurse should be available. In elderly or high-risk,
low-literacy populations, each nurse may only be able to handle 40-50
calls per shift. <br />
At the moment, there is little or no research on staffing standards in
telephone triage.&nbsp; Extrapolating from a comparable nursing sub
specialty will be difficult.&nbsp; Perhaps we will need to compare our
working conditions to those of Emergency Medical Dispatchers (EMD).&nbsp;
However, new research on working conditions in healthcare sheds light
on the issue of understaffing.&nbsp; There is a known direct correlation
between nursing shortages and patient injury. (See Box C).&nbsp; However,
just what constitutes a &ldquo;shortage&rdquo; in the telephone triage setting is
still unknown.

<strong>Awareness of Human Error, Stress and Fatigue</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Is it incumbent upon the employer to provide adequate coverage in the way of telephone triage staff?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; This is one of the areas where they need to do what
we call human factors research. They have done this research in other
areas of clinical practice and in other high-risk industries.<br />
In high-quality call centers, people have conducted informal studies,
where they know what the limits are. They get feedback from the nurses,
or they keep track of the number of near-misses and problems near the
end of the day, when people are tired or distracted. They know when
people are getting fatigued and need relief.<br />
I know they&rsquo;ve done some basic research on call times and call stress
for EMS and 911 calls. How many calls can one individual take? There
have been times when the emergency medical dispatcher has fallen asleep
during a call, or their level of stress is so high that their response
to the caller is inappropriate. In those cases, I often wonder:&nbsp; where
were they in their day, and how many calls had they taken, and how fast
were the calls coming in? We haven&rsquo;t even begun to ask those questions,
but it&rsquo;s part of human factors research, and it revolves around the
issue of fatigue. (See BOX C)
</p>

<br />
<br />
<strong>BOX C: Telephone Triage Working Conditions and Patient Safety</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
Do the working conditions of telephone triage personnel contribute
to the incidence of medical errors? A study performed in 2003 by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) examined the effect
that healthcare working conditions played in contributing to medical
errors and patient injury.&nbsp; Researchers examined working conditions.&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, they utilized categories from previous studies of the
aviation and nuclear power industries, where human error can lead to
serious error and harm. (AHRQ, 2003)<br />
In the study, AHRQ found that working conditions either served as
&ldquo;resources that improve work quality&rdquo; or as &ldquo;demands that impede work
quality&rdquo;. As illustrated in the summary of these factors below,
currently, telephone triage work represents less than optimum working
condition, possibly contributing to the potential for error and patient
injury. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In reviewing the brief analysis below, bear in mind that telephone
triage, as an emerging subspecialty, is still in the process of
&ldquo;consciousness raising&rdquo; regarding standards, training, and a culture of
safety, while simultaneously, making efforts to build the
infrastructure required to provide the safety net for this practice.<br />
<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Workforce staffing (volume of work, professional skills and
experience)&rdquo;:&nbsp; Study results indicated that increases in staffing
improved patient safety. In addition, increased experience on the part
of staff led to a reduction in medical error. Research on telephone
triage performed in the ED, showed that staff experience of 10 years or
more in telephone triage lead to better decisions (Patel, 1995).<br />
<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Workflow design (job activities)&rdquo;:&nbsp; Reductions in interruptions
and distractions reduce error. Possibly with the exception of large
call centers, many nurses perform telephone triage as part of a larger
job description.&nbsp; In any nurse&rsquo;s job (ED, Office, Labor and Delivery),
the potential for frequent interruptions is high.&nbsp; One strategy for
error reduction might be a policy that stipulated that telephone triage
task always be considered &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; (performed to the exclusion of
any other tasks) and formally assigned. Thus, the nurse on the phone is
not responsible for any other tasks and is not to be interrupted.<br />
Another area which has never been adequately addressed, but which
presents a major &ldquo;disconnect&rdquo; in the workflow, is the lack of feedback,
a gap that could easily be remedied through the use of new technology.&nbsp;
Telenurses work in a virtual vacuum &ndash; rarely learning outcomes of their
decisions.&nbsp; This faulty design feature prevents the feedback loop,
which allows nurses to learn from mistakes and thereby improving the
process.&nbsp; As suggested by Smith, follow up calls and call backs are an
invaluable risk management tool.<br />
<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Personal/social factors (stress, job satisfaction, and
professionalism)&rdquo;:&nbsp; Due to the nature of the work, telephone triage
nurses, like air traffic controllers, can experience severe job
stress.&nbsp; Patel notes that when people have time pressure, they utilize
less information and make poor decisions. Overall, professionalism is
beginning to remedy this work conditions through the development of
unique telephone triage standards and certification.<br />
<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Physical environment (light, aesthetics, and sound)&rdquo;:&nbsp; Unlike
nurses working in large call centers, telepractice is diffusely
practiced and largely, an unacknowledged subspecialty.&nbsp; Thus, the
physical environment for telenurses varies widely. While some nurses
enjoy the luxury of a specialized ergonomic workspace, many nurses
labor under less-than-optimum condition: airless, windowless rooms,
noisy hallways or offices, which offer little in the way of privacy or
sound abatement.&nbsp; The physical environment can influence concentration
and thus, decisions.&nbsp; Considering the type of concentration that
critical thinking requires, it would seem that the workspace should
resemble that of a physician&rsquo;s office as much as possible. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Organizational factors (organization and process)&rdquo;:
Organizational deficiencies, such as partial or poorly designed
standard, protocols and processes, still exist in many settings where
telephone triage is practiced, thereby paving the way for potential
error.&nbsp; The obvious lack of infrastructure described by the experts in
this article, point to the need to remedy this gap.

<br />
<strong>PRACTITIONER RISK AVOIDANCE</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; And for telenurses, what key steps should they take to avoid risk?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; Number one, use the protocols or guidelines. Number
two, when they cannot follow the protocol&mdash;and there are always
exceptions&mdash;immediately access the supervisor or provider for
consultation or advice. <br />
And then, thirdly, making sure that again, their documentation process
is complete. So, for example, if they have to deviate from an
established protocol, it&rsquo;s clear why they did what they did. It should
be evident that there was a prompt and timely disposition of the
problem.<br />
<br />
When and when not to Utilize Audio taping <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
WHEELER:&nbsp; What about audio taping calls?<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; The audiotape obviously can be your best friend or your worst
enemy. In sophisticated telephone triage call centers, I think it makes
good sense to audiotape calls&mdash;if you&rsquo;re taking thousands of calls in
your call center, and you have sound protocols, training, quality
management, and can apply the kind of analysis that needs to be done.
However, if you&rsquo;re an office-based practice and taking a limited number
of calls or just learning to do this, then I don&rsquo;t think audio taping
is warranted, or even makes sense until you get good at it.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Electronic Documentation: Pros and Cons</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Is documentation still the issue in telephone triage that it used to be?<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; This may not be specific to telephone triage, but what I&rsquo;ve
seen in recent malpractice cases in the last 20 years is an increased
emphasis on documentation. In the beginning of my career, we had to
constantly nudge people to document. In the last 10 or 15 years, the
documentation seems to have become dramatically better. People are
aware of its importance, and it is consistently better across the board
in almost every setting &mdash;hospitals, office or call centers. <br />
What&rsquo;s happened in the last two or three years is sort of a
double-edged sword. There&rsquo;s been a tendency to used computerized
charting. Frankly, as a lawyer and from my own perspective, I am
concerned about computerized charting. While it is more efficient, it
tends to be less informative. So we see charting that is efficient and
computerized, but in terms of trying to figure out what was going on
with a particular patient we see less narrative notes, less handwritten
notes.&nbsp; Sometimes a sort of &ldquo;checklist mentality&rdquo;. I think the danger
for nurses is to check the box, check the box, and check the box. It
tells you a little bit, but it doesn&rsquo;t give you much meaningful
information about what was going on.<br />
I always tell people that if you&rsquo;re stuck with a computer&mdash;and I
understand it saves time&mdash;please try to include some narrative notes,
some observations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a huge fan, particularly in a telephone triage
setting; of using the patient&rsquo;s own words in quotes. So if you&rsquo;re not
taping calls, quote patients directly.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; In informal settings, where people have been writing the
telephone triage encounter on a Post-It note and sticking that in the
chart, that won&rsquo;t work anymore. Whenever possible, the telephone
encounter has to go on an official form of some kind that the doctor,
the midwife, the family practice has created, and it gets placed in the
medical record permanently. <br />
In an informal setting, the ideal would be to write in the progress
note in the chart.&nbsp; Ideally, it should be a special form, whether you
staple it in, paste it in, or tape it in. It can&rsquo;t be a Post-It note.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Charting by Inclusion vs. Exclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Do you have any opinions about charting by inclusion versus exclusion?<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp; There&rsquo;s really no defined legal standard as to whether it
should be charting by inclusion or exclusion. I think the important
thing is for a nurse to be able to say I maintained this as my practice
or routine; I always do it this way or I always do it that way, by
inclusion or exclusion. So, for example, if they&rsquo;re only documenting
significant changes and everything else is presumed to be normal, then
they should consistently apply that. <br />
Obviously, the more information the better. A lawyer would like to see
more information so they can tell what the nurse was thinking.&nbsp; For
example, did he or she do a neuro assessment or evaluate other
categories of problems that the nurse ought to be thinking about?<br />
However, if the nurse doesn&rsquo;t have the time or ability to do that, and
is only charting pertinent findings, I don&rsquo;t have any difficulty with
that, as long as the nurse consistently applies the method and covers
the right questions or the right issues in the assessment.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Telepractice from Home</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the new trend toward nurses working from home, taking telephone triage calls?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER I believe the standard of care is the standard of care
regardless of where the call is received, where it&rsquo;s intercepted and
processed. If a registered nurse, for example, is carrying out that
process in her home, the standard of care doesn&rsquo;t change. You still
have to have guidelines or protocols or algorithms; you have to have an
exit strategy for when the protocol doesn&rsquo;t apply; you have to have
some kind of process in place for 911 calls&mdash;how to manage them,
regardless of where you are. The process may be slightly different in
terms of how you access certain emergency services, but it should be
basically the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Which subspecialties carry the most risk in telephone triage
&ndash; between OB, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, General and Family
Practice, and Pediatrics?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; I think some of the biggest risk is in General and Family
Practice medicine, because they have to take everything. They are often
managing Pediatrics, OB, Geriatrics, diabetics, and general medical
patients. The person answering the phone may have a general knowledge
of medical-surgical problems, but cannot transfer that general
knowledge to a population of obstetric or pediatric patients who are
outside the normal range of symptomatology and medications. So they get
into trouble.<br />
The overwhelming majority of the cases involving telephone triage that
I take as an obstetric expert witness are in the family practice office
setting. The patient eventually gets to an OB provider or a pediatric
provider. However, if an infant is quickly developing severe jaundice
and the person in the family practice setting says, &ldquo;Well, you know,
babies get yellow; this is normal,&rdquo; then we have a problem.<br />
What if the caller says, &ldquo;I think I need an appointment with an
optometrist; I can&rsquo;t read anymore&rdquo;? The first thing an OB nurse thinks
is,&rdquo; Here is a woman having blurred vision, possibly due to
preeclampsia.&rdquo; In a pediatric office, there would be a similar level of
vigilance about certain types of parental complaints. The same goes for
oncology patients. However, in a family practice setting, it may be too
much to expect. How can you be all things to all people?<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that you&rsquo;re saying something extremely important
here, and it&rsquo;s revealing a new area of potential risk.&nbsp; In the OB and
pediatric settings, triage personnel know the red flags and these
personnel are highly sensitive; whereas the advice nurse in family
practice may not be as aware.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Informed Refusal and the Duty to Terrify</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Dan Tennenhouse coined the term &ldquo;duty to terrify&rdquo;. It
applies to the duty of the nurse to inform or apprise the caller of the
seriousness of his or her symptoms. He states, &ldquo;It is a duty based on
the liability from an injury, to the noncompliant person, who claims
that his or her noncompliance was due to an inadequate understanding of
the urgency of the situation&rdquo; (1988). Any last thoughts on the &ldquo;duty to
terrify&rdquo; and why that&rsquo;s important?<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; &ldquo;Duty to terrify&rdquo; is the process of informed refusal and
the standard to which the telenurse will be held. It is what we call
the &ldquo;reasonable patient standard.&rdquo; In other words, what would a
reasonable, competent adult want to know about the risk of not
following the advice? It is a more stringent and broader concept,
meaning that you do have a duty. <br />
In one case I know of, the staff members were saying, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want
to frighten the patient&rsquo;.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. So the new
yardstick against which the precautions or the disclaimer is given is:
what would a reasonable patient want to know? It is not what a
reasonable provider thinks the patient should know. That has changed;
that&rsquo;s a big reversal.<br />
And, secondly, under that category of what a reasonable patient would
want to know is the principle that the patient has a right to informed
refusal, and the key word is informed. If you haven&rsquo;t told them what a
reasonable patient would want to know, how could they give informed
refusal?<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; What I tell nurses is to tell the patient something like,
&ldquo;The symptoms you&rsquo;ve described to me sound very serious, or even maybe
life-threatening. I need you to come to the Emergency Room within the
next 20 minutes. Can you do that?&rdquo;<br />
I believe that statement provides a very clear message to the patient
of the seriousness of the situation. My understanding is it&rsquo;s not
enough to simply say, &ldquo;You need to be seen in the Emergency Room.&rdquo; It
really needs to be impressed upon the patient the seriousness of the
situation by giving a specific time frame and getting his or her
agreement. At the same time, it is important to not be so specific in
your assessment that you seem to be making a diagnosis or prognosis.<br />
<br />
MAHLMEISTER:&nbsp; That is correct. In common parlance, it&rsquo;s the duty to
terrify, or informed consent based on what a reasonable person would
want to know. When you say life-threatening and within a certain number
of minutes, you are discharging your duty. It is not adequate to simply
advise the patient to come to the ED.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>TELEPRACTICE: AN ALL-OR-NOTHING PROPOSITION</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
WHEELER:&nbsp; Do you have any final thoughts to add?<br />
<br />
SMITH:&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawyers get worried when people dabble in this. You can&rsquo;t
have your foot halfway in the water and halfway out. In office
settings, or in a hospital unit, nurses talk about the fact that they
take calls, but they try to limit the call or they limit the advice.
The reality is that once the call begins and you begin to dispense
advice, you&rsquo;re in the water&mdash;you can&rsquo;t be halfway in and halfway out.
You&rsquo;d be better off in a hospital setting refusing to dispense any
advice. It&rsquo;s an all-or-nothing proposition.
</p>
<p>
<br />
In a small doctor&rsquo;s office, the advice will depend on whoever
answers the phone. There&rsquo;s no consistent uniform policy, and so it
varies widely from person to person. Frankly, those are situations that
are most at risk. When they&rsquo;re giving a little bit of advice and
thinking that they&rsquo;re limiting their liability, they are not. Maybe
they&rsquo;re doing it in a haphazard manner:&nbsp; whoever happens by picks up
the phone; the documentation is a scribbled note on a telephone message
pad. That situation is more prevalent in office settings than almost
anywhere else; it is a very risky proposition.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Telepractice Risk Management: Best Practices</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
Finally, people ask, &ldquo;How can I be certain I won&rsquo;t get sued?&rdquo; The
answer is you can never be certain. We live in a risk-filled
environment. The minute you answer the call, you&rsquo;ve assumed some risk,
and that&rsquo;s always going to be the case. So the issue then becomes, how
do you best protect yourself? Good training, good qualifications, good
protocols, back-up physicians or back-up nurses; if in doubt, follow-up
phone calls&mdash;in my opinion, these steps represent layers of protection.
</p>
<p>
<br />
To me, you&rsquo;re building a structure to protect yourself; that&rsquo;s what
I mean by layers of protection. But remember, no matter how many layers
you have, you&rsquo;re never going to be immune. However, I do believe in the
concept of risk containment and risk management. <br />
At the end of the day, you&rsquo;re not talking about eliminating risk,
you&rsquo;re talking about managing and minimizing it, in the context of
providing the best professional care that you can. Sometimes we lose
sight of that reason. The containment of risk affords the best possible
care and that&rsquo;s your ultimate goal.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
William Langewieshe, pilot and writer, put it best, when he
reflected on the role of system error in the crash of ValuJet 592, in
which all 105 passengers perished.&nbsp; He refers to &ldquo;blizzards of small
judgments&rdquo; made by mechanics who employed a &ldquo; good old-fashioned pencil
whipping&rdquo;(which resulted in the fire that led to the plane crash).&nbsp; He
refers to this action as &ldquo;widespread form of the &lsquo;normalization of
deviance&rsquo;&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Langwiesche laments the failure of large systems that
create an &ldquo;entire pretend reality that includes unworkable chains of
command, unlearnable training programs, unreadable manuals, and the
fiction of regulations, check and controls&rdquo; (1998).
</p>
<p>
<br />
<br />
Langewiesche&rsquo;s remarks have clear implications for both the
healthcare system and telephone triage. It is clear that telephone
triage is a newly recognized sub-system within the larger healthcare
system.&nbsp; As such, it too is vulnerable to &ldquo;system error&rdquo;. <br />
Risk is a fact of life in telepractice. Ignoring the risks or providing
half-solutions only deepens the liability.&nbsp; True solutions rest in the
awareness of potential pitfalls, and commitment to the painstaking
process of building&nbsp; &ldquo;reality based&rdquo; risk management infrastructure to
support the emerging field.
