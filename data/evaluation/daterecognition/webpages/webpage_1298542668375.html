<strong style=" font-size:20px; padding-left:5px;">Buckland Traffic Study:<br />
    </strong><br />

<p>The Traffic study conducted by the DOT has identified certain improvements to the roads surrounding the Bryan Farms Neighborhood.</p>
    <p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Proposed FAST TRACK improvements to exit 63 of I-84:</span></p>
    <p>A Westbound exit ramp is proposed on the North side of I-84 (Development Preferred Option Package, 1.4 Recommendation Plan 1.4.4.2). To accommodate this ramp acquisition of land along the property of several homes on Bryan and Baldwin Drives will be needed, including the taking of the Smiths house on Baldwin. A good portion of the land in play was left by the original developer to act as a buffer from the highway as was its intent back when the 
        Wilbur Cross was abutting theses homes. During the 1970's I believe some of this land was used and the topography of the natural hills were changed. The BTS further recommends adding East and West bound lanes to be used exclusively for traffic exiting and entering the Interstate. They say no additional land is needed for this improvement. The same group also claims (at the South Windsor meeting) an exit ramp has a foot print of 12.5 feet wide, 26 feet is called out in the study. What will the curve of the ramp add to the 26 foot footprint? Trafic volume for no build situtation is 5570 cars per hour, projected volumes for options 2,3 &4 is 5570, no improvement in traffic flow with new ramp( Future Performence of Prefered AlteritivesTable 3.1) and only a 10% gain in holding capacity (Table 3.2)</p>
    <p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Omissions and Oversite:</span></p>
    <p>A number of oversites were noticed including Bryan Farms not being called out as a residential neighborhood (2-Implementing Plan 2.2.12), Bryans Farms was also not included in areas sensitive to noise analysis(Figure 45B noise sensitive Areas). The traffic at the intersection at Avery Street was mentioned but only as an area that needed further study. The only mention about Bryan farms was a reference to a "vestage of residential homes"(not in overlay of residential areas), no concern was expressed for the impact of these changes to this neighborhood.</p>
    <p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Land Acquisition:</span></p>
    <p>The land being considered for use is a tract of land called out on town records as belonging to 
        I.R. Stitch the original developer of the Bryan Fanns neighborhood. That along with the Smiths house on Baldwin would be land that is taken( Right of Way Impacts 2.1 Smiths house missed?). Land left from the 1970's land acquisition along Demming will also be used.</p>

<p><span style=" font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;">Ingress Egress</span></p>

    <p><span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">I. Current Conditions</span></p>
    <p>The first access point to the neighborhood is a two lane road, three way intersection at Avery and Alberta with a STOP sign for traffic entering Avery from Alberta. Many years ago a three way STOP was tried but it made climbing Avery Street in inclimate weather impossible due to the steep grade and it was removed soon thereafter. The speed of the oncoming traffic plus the volume of cars makes it difficult to exit.
    </p>
    <p>The second access point is Macintosh and Demming. Demming has 5 Northbound lanes and 2 southbound lanes, Macintosh is a two lane road. The only traffic control is a STOP sign for the cars entering from Macintosh onto Demming. Only during low traffic times can anything other than a right turn can be safley made, when they removed the MEDIAN in the center of the road it made getting out almost impossible, it acted as an area of refuge.
    </p>
    <p>The southbound leadlight left turn onto Avery from Demming has a short time span and sometimes not enough holding room. That coupled with traffic turning into and leaving Gateway Plaza on Avery Street can be problematic.
    </p>

<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Proposed Changes by BTS:</span></p>
    <p>No Changes for Avery Street. Make Macintosh right in right out only (Development Preferered Option Package 1.2.2)remember we will now compete with exiting highway traffic if this ramp is approved.
</p>
<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Scenerios for Improvements:</span></p>
<p>I propose the addition of a light at Demming and Macintosh that may require moving the Macintosh entrance/ exit North or South a few yards to create a holding area for exiting cars. The Avery Street entrance should be made right in only (one way). This will help stop unwanted traffic making shortcuts through the neighborhood during peak hours.
</p>
<p><span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Air Noise and Light Pollution:</span></p>
<p>Attention should be given to the neighborhood and the impact of lighting changes due to highway improvements. 
    Noise and emissions from existing and new traffic patterns close to residential homes, 
    also a concern. Line of sight issues are an area that become increasingly important when road expansion is proposed. No mention of Bryan Farms in Technical Memorandun #2,3.4.13 Noise Sensitive Areas.
</p>
<p><span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Pedestrian Access:</span></p>
<p>The neighborhood is within a mile of Northwest Park, Vernon Game Room, Supermarkets and Fast Food establishments, some of which could be called and attractive nuisance to children and teenagers. Safe passage to any of these facilities is almost impossible and things in their current state are impossible to navigate on foot. Improvements must be made to correct current conditions. The addition of an off ramp would further isolate our neighborhood.
</p>
<p><span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Planning and Zoning:</span></p>
<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Isolation from Town and failure of P&Z to maintain integrity of rural residential zone, spot zoning:</span></p>
<p>The town has at times practiced spot zoning either by choice or inadvertently. We have seen density restrictions put in place and then ignored because the developer needs more density to make the project viable. Driveways were installed on a residential road to pasify a developer of a strip mall. Sidewalk installations were deferred on commercial development along Route 30 leaving pedestrians to walk in the road. This is what happens on the North side of town. We see moratoriums on high density housing, Highschool site development blocked and low density housing on the other side of town with open space requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style=" font-size:12px; font-weight:bold;">Past Precedents:</span></p>
<p>In the 1970's a group of homeowners and an entire neighborhood banded together to stop the destruction of their home and the dismantling of their neighborhood. The cause they fought for had merit and they prevailed, we hope to do the same. What was a bad idea 39 years ago is a bad idea today.
